<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916021475">I just re-read the &quot;Magical Thinking and Spoiled Children&quot; page on Sandra&#39;s<br/>
site (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spoiled)">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled)</a>.  I&#39;d like to quote something Pam<br/>

&quot;We then went to three grocery stores, one right after another, because<br/>
Holly (who was maybe 4 or 5 at the time) was really wanting some plums and<br/>
the first couple of stores we went to didn&#39;t have any.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I first read this a few years ago I wished that I lived in<br/>
a town where I could do this sort of thing for my daughter.  We live<br/>
rurally, and although we have two small markets and an organic food/deli<br/>
market the options are really limited.  We only get plums during the<br/>
season, and even then not even the whole season.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago Nicole wanted navel oranges (she doesn&#39;t like valencias).  Our<br/>
community didn&#39;t have any yet.  We could have driven about 45 minutes to<br/>
one town (they have some large brand-name groceries), but she didn&#39;t want<br/>
to make the long drive.  And honestly, I often don&#39;t want to make the long<br/>
drive.  But we do get to that town every week, so I always put these<br/>
requests on a list.  Still, she doesn&#39;t get the orange that she&#39;s in the<br/>
mood for.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the other day we happened to stop at McDonald&#39;s and she discovered<br/>
that one of the toy options was a fairy.  She adores fairies.  We were in<br/>
the small town (only one McDs) and they didn&#39;t have any fairies.  She was<br/>
heartbroken.  But, it just so happened that we were driving to the really<br/>
large city and there were at least 5 McDs on the way.  She was delighted!<br/>
We stopped at every one, and the last one had the fairy.  It felt so good<br/>
to be able to make each stop for her, and to finally attain victory in just<br/>
one afternoon.  But that night she took her doll somewhere with her and<br/>
lost it.  We were staying over at my Mom&#39;s, so no problem -- we&#39;d just go<br/>
back to that one McDs on the way home.  Nope - they were now out of<br/>
fairies.  We had stopped at every McDs on the way there, so I was beside<br/>
myself and Nicole was so angry with me for not trying.  How could I explain<br/>
to her that I had tried!  All of a sudden I remembered one more McDs that<br/>
we hadn&#39;t been to.  She wanted to go in herself and ask.  The manager went<br/>
into the back, rummaged around, and found one.  I will never forget the<br/>
grin on Nicole&#39;s face (and the joy in her heart) when she came back<br/>
victorious again.  She sincerely thanked me for helping her, for trying all<br/>
of the different places, and for remembering this one last one.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something I get to do for her very often, since we live so far<br/>
away from places.  But as she gets older she does see that this same thing<br/>
can happen when I make a list so we&#39;ll get it next time we&#39;re in town or go<br/>
online and buy it now (even though it won&#39;t show up for a week or so.)  I&#39;m<br/>
just so happy that we got to experience &#39;driving around&#39; for real.<br/>

<br/>
That is really sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Holly got a rat yesterday.  She had two and wanted a third one.  I made a <br/>
couple of phone calls in advance, and then drove in the rain.  I was determined <br/>
to be patient and even drive to the pet store way across town that we knew had <br/>
female fancy rats, but she found one at the second store and there was a very <br/>
nice young employee who knew lots about rats and had bred them, who talked to <br/>
us quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
It made me feel good to just decide that the rest of my day could be spent <br/>
letting Holly take her time and learn about rats and choose one.<br/>
<br/>
The two she has, she&#39;s had for a year.  They&#39;re big and healthy.  <br/>
The one she got yesterday is small and bony and passive.  She said something <br/>
earlier today about it being the kind of rat that might not live, but that <br/>
nobody would have bought it to feed a snake because it was still and scrawny.   <br/>
So she seems to have the calm idea that if it doesn&#39;t live that&#39;s acceptable, <br/>
and if it does that will be GREAT!  She has pampered and bottle fed it, and <br/>
last night it slept in a separate little cage, on her bed, with a hot corn bag <br/>
near it.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a willingness to drive around without the necessity to actually do <br/>
so can be cool too.  &quot;Yes, I will do this if it takes hours&quot; might just take <br/>
twenty minutes, and everyone has that warm loving shared feeling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you found the fairy, Barbara.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118468482">So cool that Holly adopted the rat that really needed her the most.  I<br/>
raised gerbals (they don&#39;t have those here in CA, so maybe this is just a<br/>
mid-west pet?) when I was a kid, and I really enjoyed taking care of the<br/>
mice and rats at school.  I wouldn&#39;t mind having a rat as a pet, but maybe<br/>
after awhile... we just got a guinnea pig.<br/>

Nicole saw a pet store.  She wanted to go visit the animals first, before<br/>
doing the other stuff.  Afterward, she asked if we could always find pet<br/>
stores while we&#39;re out so she can visit the animals.  It was just so great,<br/>
and I was thinking how wonderful it is that I can give her all the time in<br/>
the world to hang out and visit with the pets, and then we trade places and<br/>
she gives me all the time in the world to hang out and try to find more<br/>
sheets! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, me too.  If Nicole doesn&#39;t end up wanting to keep it over the years,<br/>
I probably will.  It really represents such a great moment, tough but<br/>
victorious in the end.<br/>

<br/>
We have done this exact type of thing more times than I can recall,<br/>
including whenever we are on vacation. We have gone on &quot;family quests&quot; for<br/>
some particular toy, including driving 25 miles to the only toy store that<br/>
had a particular toy after phoning all over. We have driven into the night<br/>
to look for a lost toy that we may have dropped on the sidewalk. At the last<br/>
conference we searched Salem, unsuccessfully, for the right kind of witch<br/>
doll - which gave us a terrific overview of Salem. It is always in the<br/>
spirit of adventure, and I think Jayn appreciates the fun of the search. And<br/>
the joy when the desired object is found!<br/>

We visited a pet store in Wilkes-Barre, PA on our way back from the Live  and <br/>
Learn Conference.  It was pouring rain from the hurricanes and we were  kind <br/>
of stuck in W-B, and there was a pet store on the way to the hotel.   We <br/>
impulsively just pulled into it.  It was a nice respite from being on  the road, <br/>
and we had missed our pets for 3 weeks.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was such a good idea, we hit two more between there and  Arkansas!<br/>
