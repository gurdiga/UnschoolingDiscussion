<div id="ygrps-yiv-886616122">We have 2 hermit crabs that have been alive since this summer.  All <br/>
we do is keep their sponge wet and put a few drops of hermit crab <br/>
food in every day.  The first time we had hermit crabs they died.  <br/>
The place we bought them from had told us that they just need crumbs <br/>
from people food so not to buy any special food.  This time we <br/>
actually bought the hermit crab food (very cheap and one container <br/>
lasts forever). I think it&#39;s the food that&#39;s keeping them alive, so I <br/>
would recommend it.   It&#39;s fun to get them out and put them on the <br/>
sidewalk and watch them crawl.  <br/>
<br/>
Just don&#39;t forget to put their lids back on their cages, or they&#39;ll <br/>
crawl out and disappear.  That happened to us--my daughter was very <br/>
sad that our hermit crab was lost.  Then, we were at our homeopath&#39;s <br/>
for a visit, and I had brought a big basket of Lincoln logs for them <br/>
to play with during the appointment.  My daughter sat down to play <br/>
with the Lincoln logs and in a few minutes yelled, &quot;Hey, I found <br/>
Hermie!&quot;  lol  <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, they don&#39;t live long in captivity.<br/>
One of the main problems is that when a hermit crab needs to find a bigger <br/>
shell they will test out many, many new shells in the wild before finding one <br/>
that &quot;feels&quot; right.<br/>
In captivity it&#39;s fairly difficult (if not impossible) to offer them the vast <br/>
array they need in order to switch over when they need to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699931536">My oldest always had hermit crabs growing up. They are buried all over the <br/>
city!<br/>
<br/>
She loved them as pets and we had as many as five at a time. We kept them in <br/>
an aquarium with the small brown pebbles for the bottom. We sloped one side <br/>
and had a little pond for them in there also. So they could go into the <br/>
shallow water and come out with ease. We fed them from a bottle cap. We did <br/>
have the hermit crab food that does indeed last forever. We would also give <br/>
tiny scraps of people food too. And they just love peanut butter. I loved to <br/>
just watch them eat that when we gave it to them. We had various ones for <br/>
short and also long periods of time. When one might crawl out of his shell, <br/>
you need to put him on moist soil or sand, alone, and give him other larger <br/>
shells to choose from for his new home. Unfortunately for us, they never <br/>
made it after that. It was so sad to see this poor little naked crab die. <br/>
But I have heard from others that they have been successful at this. Maybe <br/>
our shells weren&#39;t desirable enough!<br/>
<br/>
On another note, if one gets attached to a small hand, immerse the whole <br/>
crab and hand in warm water until the crab releases.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-612423290">I owned many, many hermit crabs as a kid.  We got one every year at the beach.  They usually die within a few months.  The most important thing to have is shells of many different sizes, so he can move houses when he needs to.  Let me know if you have any specific questions.<br/>
