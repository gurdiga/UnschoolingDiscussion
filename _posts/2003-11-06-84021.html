life.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d avoid visiting my mother if I could, but she&#39;s asked for us to come up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(we&#39;ll be staying with my inlaws who are 100% supportive of us) and visit.<br/>
She&#39;s never met the two youngest, only seen Logan once and Sarah three times<br/>
in their lives.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Call her up and tell her that you are homeschooling, you know this a hot<br/>
issue for her, and that you don&#39;t want to talk about it during the visit.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel so inclined, you can give her a list of reading materials and<br/>
suggest that she educate herself on the subject, and if she still has<br/>
questions or concerns once she knows something about homeschooling, you&#39;ll<br/>
be happy to talk it over with her. Print out a bunch of stuff from the net<br/>
and send it to her.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her you want her and the children to enjoy visiting with each other,<br/>
not watch their mother argue with their grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
If she can&#39;t or won&#39;t agree to it, she doesn&#39;t want to see her grandkids<br/>
that bad, and you can cancel the visit.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, no contact IS better, hard as that is to think about. :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70250152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; SO when we go home, and my mother realizes that Sarah&#39;s &quot;missing nearly<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a friend who sat in on a 1st grade classroom for a day with a<br/>
stopwatch.  She had the watch running whenever there was &quot;real instruction<br/>
and schoolwork&quot; going on.  When the teacher had to stop and say, &quot;Johnny,<br/>
keep your fingers out of your nose&quot;, or &quot;Yes, Suzie?  Yes, you may go to the<br/>
bathroom, but make it quick&quot; or &quot;Put your reading books away and take out<br/>
your math books&quot; or &quot;Settle down, class, settle down&quot; or any other &quot;non<br/>
teaching&quot; stuff, the clock was not running.  At the end of the day, the<br/>
stopwatch had ticked off one hour and six minutes.<br/>
<br/>
You could relay this story to your mother and explain that since you are one<br/>
on one (or one on 5 or however many kids you have), you don&#39;t have all this<br/>
administrative wasted time.  That story gets people&#39;s eyes to pop.  &quot;No<br/>
waaaayy....you must be kidding.&quot;  Then I tell them to think back and they<br/>
say, &quot;Ewww...you&#39;re right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, what are kids learning in school from 15 December until 15 January?<br/>
NOTHING.  Before Christmas is the excitement and concerts and the parties<br/>
and then there is the 2 week holiday and then when they get back, they have<br/>
to get back into the swing of things, reviewing all that they forgot over<br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Some people refuse to use &quot;school speak&quot; on principle.  Sometimes you have<br/>
to speak another language to get your point across.  You just hafta decide<br/>
who deserves your efforts and who might benefit from them and then speak the<br/>
appropriate language.<br/>
