Thank you Ren.  :-)  It feels so good to help my children follow their<br/>
dreams.  I learned to stand up for myself by standing up for my children.  I<br/>
learned to follow my own dreams by helping my children to follow theirs.<br/>
Sometimes the things that you think stand between you and your dreams aren&#39;t<br/>
as hard to vault over as you think they might be.  Life is so good!<br/>
