<div id="ygrps-yiv-490071862">Hmmmm, interesting report.  I wonder if the quality of learning for the<br/>
students is rising just as fast?  With such highly paid managerial &quot;talent&quot;<br/>
at the helm, it has got to have a trickle down effect to the students,<br/>
doesn&#39;t it????<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;But the Chronicle report said critics worry that by behaving more like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>businesses, colleges might be losing the idea that they are non-profit<br/>
institutions with an intent to serve.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I say lets cut through the rhetoric.  Higher education has become an<br/>
industry just like any other.  Let&#39;s just admit this to ourselves and get on<br/>
with things.<br/>
