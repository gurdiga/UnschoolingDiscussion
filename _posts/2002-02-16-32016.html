<div id="ygrps-yiv-576057733">Good: Since we&#39;re away from home, my son has been going to pick up <br/>
his cousin everyday from school with my sister. As a social <br/>
butterfly, I thought he would see the afterschool social aspect, but <br/>
not the other... He told me yesturday that he loves homeschooling and <br/>
is glad is doesn&#39;t have to go to school. *sigh of relief*<br/>
<br/>
Bad/Sad: When we go back to NYC the scope of people to play with will <br/>
greatly diminish. And I can see his lonliness.<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: When people actually tell me that they *feel a sigh of relief* <br/>
after they ask me how NY &#39;regulates&#39; homeschooling parents. As if <br/>
parents can&#39;t be trusted, and the riduculous (sp) amount of paperwork <br/>
that parents have to do will justify it.<br/>
<br/>
Good: My breast cancer is completely gone. Cured. Not remission. <br/>
There is no indication that it ever existed.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: The three seperate &#39;conventional&#39; doctors that I went to for my <br/>
original diagnosis told me I must of been &#39;misdiagnosed&#39; - as if <br/>
their ego can&#39;t handle anything beyond &#39;remission&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: It costs people a fortune to choose alternative lifestyles. As <br/>
if the conventional ones are perfect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560573608">Can you possibly remain a citizen of another state? Michigan for example is<br/>
the easy state in the union to homeschool. Also there is Clonlara they<br/>
&quot;enroll&quot; students from all over the world and are well equipped with what is<br/>
needed for each state.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Their philosophy is very much geared toward the unschooler as well.<br/>
