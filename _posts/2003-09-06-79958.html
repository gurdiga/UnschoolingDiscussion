<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779220981">I&#39;ve got some good news! For years now, ever since Jack was born over seven <br/>
years ago, I have been fighting some pretty nasty health problems. Actually I <br/>
had problems with my pregnancy with Moly; I bled throughout my pregnancy with <br/>
her and gained over 100 pounds. Then she was born about six weeks early and my <br/>
placenta looked funny to my OBGYN so he ordered some tests. Those came back <br/>
that I had probably been carrying twins and that the reason I bled throughout my <br/>
pregnancy was that I had lost one. I never really lost the extra weight from <br/>
that pregnancy, had a miscarriage, then got pregnant with Jack where I gained <br/>
even more weight (again almost 100 pounds) and my kidneys started to fail. <br/>
After Jack was born, I never went back to having normal periods and started <br/>
gaining weight at a rate of around four to six (sometimes more) pounds a month. <br/>
<br/>
After going without periods for a few years and having numerous D & C&#39;s, <br/>
(five in the past seven years) I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, <br/>
without the polycystic ovaries. Two years ago my OB found precancerous cells on <br/>
my cervix and right inside my uterus. That was taken care of with some <br/>
painful procedures! And thankfully everything with that has been resolved. About a <br/>
year ago my OB, my internist and I got together and reviewed all my symptoms <br/>
and discussed what to do about my weight and other related problems. They let me <br/>
know that I was kind of in a catch 22. I had to loose the weight to help <br/>
resolve the medical problems, but the medical problems would prevent me from <br/>
loosing the weight! So we discussed weight loss surgery. <br/>
<br/>
Well, after a year, almost to the date of that consultation, I have been <br/>
approved by insurance to have the surgery! I am now waiting to be put on my <br/>
surgeon&#39;s operating schedule but by this time next year I should be a smaller, <br/>
healthier me! <br/>
<br/>
Darin and I have always wanted more kids and since Jack I have been basically <br/>
infertile. I am so excited because loosing all this weight will resolve or <br/>
help resolve most of my symptoms of PCOS. So while we are very excited about me <br/>
loosing the weight, we are really ecstatic about the thought of maybe a baby <br/>
in the next year or two! <br/>
<br/>
If you pray, or light candles, or send good thoughts, or what ever you do... <br/>
please keep me and especially my family in your thoughts. This certainly isn&#39;t <br/>
without risks, but to me, living with the alternative is just not an option <br/>
anymore. Sorry to take list time up with this, but I really had to share with <br/>
someone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530775550">Hi Nancy,<br/>
I will certainly send some kind, positive thoughts your way.  I was<br/>
diagnosed last year with PCOS.  I go to a local endocrinologist<br/>
(Cincinnati) who tells me how fortunate I am that he is here,  since he<br/>
is one of the top 4-5 in the country for this. (His ego is definitely<br/>
intact!)<br/>
<br/>
I take glucophage,  which has enabled me to have regular periods for the<br/>
first time ever (I&#39;m 39).  I also have lost about 30 pounds (in fiteen<br/>
months)  This may not sound like much,  but I did have trouble with the<br/>
eating and exercise program with three deaths in the family in the past<br/>
year.  I seem to be more &quot;on track&quot; now with eating and exercising<br/>
according to the plan I made with the dieticians.<br/>
<br/>
I can certainly say that with the treatment,  I feel my body has<br/>
changed.  I have the insulin resistant type, which you probably do,  as<br/>
seen in the weight gain.  I now feel my body metabolism responds more<br/>
appropriately to food.   The insulin difficulty,  according to my Doc,<br/>
is that your body produces insulin in correct levels to the carbs you<br/>
eat,  but the insulin does not absorb well.  SO your body craves more<br/>
carbs,  so that you have to produce excessive insulin and then your body<br/>
will finally absorb enough to make you be satisfied....however,  you<br/>
have eaten extra food and therefore, inevitably gain weight.  My niece<br/>
was the first in our family to be diagnosed.  She has lost over fifty<br/>
pounds and kept it off for almost 2 years now.  She will take glucophage<br/>
the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you well with it all.  My OB/Gyn is fully supportive of the<br/>
program....says untreated PCOS usually takes 20 yrs off life<br/>
expectancy....the risk for heart disease,  diabetes,  is 80% higher than<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; population.<br/>

My friend Helena, who lives in London, had that surgery about five years ago. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just talked to her on the phone earlier today.  She was at a rest stop in <br/>
France! (That has little to do with this except...)  She&#39;s there with her three <br/>
children, just her and the kids.  It helps that the oldest is twelve.<br/>
<br/>
She and her husband had one daughter.  Helena had always been heavy her whole <br/>
life, but after that pregnancy she kept having miscarriages.   <br/>
<br/>
Since the surgery (for which she went to Southern California), she has had <br/>
two more babies.  With the third, she didn&#39;t even know she was pregnant until <br/>
she was four months in, which was great because she didn&#39;t have the fears of <br/>
miscarriage.<br/>
<br/>
It IS risky.  Maybe a video tape of you with your family is in order (taken <br/>
by someone else so you&#39;re all in there).  It will also be a good before and <br/>
after record for when you&#39;re smaller.<br/>

I am on glucophage too, I have been for the past two years. Ever since my OB <br/>
heard about the University of Chicago doing a trial using insulin to treat <br/>
PCOS. While it hasn&#39;t allowed me to loose any weight, it has stabilized my weight <br/>
gain. I have been steady at the same weight since a month or two after <br/>
starting it, which is good! Because if I had kept gaining like I was I would be <br/>
pushing 600+ pounds by now, I am sure! So I am grateful for that! :o)<br/>
