&gt; Subject: New to Unschooling<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I have decided to embark on unschooling our 7 year<br/>
&gt; old son. We are simultaneously excited and nervous. We like the free-<br/>
&gt; style approach unschooling offers our extremely curious child, yet am<br/>
&gt; confused by it. Any suggestions on how to ease our family into this<br/>
&gt; transition?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear bkmblpn, <br/>
<br/>
Easing into unschooling....?  Hmmmm  Have you ever tried &quot;easing&quot; youself<br/>
off a cliff. How &#39;bout &quot;easing&quot; your car into a concrete wall at 40 mph.<br/>
Thinking about those gives one the same excited and nervous feeling. We<br/>
know it&#39;s there. A lot of it comes from the kind things your relatives say,<br/>
like, &quot;You&#39;re going to ruin that boy....and he&#39;s so smart, too...God, it&#39;s a<br/>
shame. Where did you get this idea...I&#39;ve never really trusted you, bkmblpn,<br/>
now I know why.&quot;   ?^)<br/>
<br/>
As has been noted often, unschooling is what you don&#39;t do. Too bad there<br/>
isn&#39;t a good name for the positives of it, other that simply living a real<br/>
life with your child. But the transition requires a conscious effort to<br/>
pretend that there is no such thing as school.<br/>
<br/>
Many adults can&#39;t do that. School is the elephant in the middle of their<br/>
house. They can&#39;t imagine life without it.<br/>
<br/>
So your little trick is to unschool your self, or deschool yourself, as some<br/>
see this need. Your kid will not have a problem at all, I promise, except<br/>
when he&#39;s &quot;bored&quot; and remembers a friend who&#39;s still in school.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the friends from school as needed. He need those contacts if possible.<br/>
Otherwise, be examples for him. Take your own interests seriously and he<br/>
will develop his own. Give him access to real activities in your community.<br/>
Let him involve himself deeply, say, in exactly what the stockpeople do at<br/>
the market -- the ones who put the stuff on the shelves. Why is the Jelly on<br/>
this shelf instead of that one? Why is the milk all the way in the back of<br/>
the market? and the meat, too.? and why are there a thousand little things<br/>
right at the checkout?<br/>
<br/>
Similar thrilling questions can be pondered all day as you walk around the<br/>
community and watch things closely and figure out why everything is the way<br/>
it is. Who decided where the streets should be?<br/>
<br/>
Somebody stop me, please... let the poor woman think up her own damn<br/>
questions for her poor son.<br/>
<br/>
The really important stuff is what is on that kid&#39;s mind. After schooling,<br/>
he probably has the opinion that his ideas are not important to anyone.<br/>
School has that purpose -- to kill the spirit of children and thus turn<br/>
creative individuals into obedient sheep.<br/>
<br/>
 So your job is to TAKE HIM  SERIOUSLY -- ALWAYS.  There&#39;s even a website or<br/>
a group called Taking Children Seriously. That is sometimes a transition for<br/>
adults in itself, listening to the thoughts and ideas of kids and discussing<br/>
them without being disparaging or condescending....after all, they&#39;re so,<br/>
well, childish. You need to get into the practice of that, so your kid will<br/>
trust you with his thoughts and will also be interested in yours (sometimes,<br/>
maybe, if you&#39;re lucky).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: &quot;Unschooling&quot; is the word to remember whenever either or your<br/>
spouse get the urge to &quot;educate&quot; the kid. If you &quot;teach&quot; him anything, teach<br/>
him not to let you do that to him, ever, unless he BEGS you. He&#39;ll love<br/>
controlling that part of his life.<br/>
<br/>
Schooling is artificial. UNschooling is real life...it&#39;s everything that<br/>
school isn&#39;t.<br/>

Let us know how it goes. . . once a week at least. Consider this<br/>
UNschool-anon for former school addicts. We&#39;re listening.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785059467">WOW, were you the fly on the wall at my parents house the other night when I <br/>
told them our plans ? You practically had their reaction word for word. <br/>
FREAKY :-) I&#39;m 42 with two other sons, 24 and 13, I only wish I learned then <br/>
what I&#39;m learning now. Mom and Dad will get over it!  Oh, and thanks for the <br/>
advice. It&#39;s much appreciated.<br/>
