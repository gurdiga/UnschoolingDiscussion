Family Pasttimes cooperative games.  (At least I think that&#39;s the company.)<br/>
You play them as a group, and it&#39;s the group that either wins or loses.  She<br/>

some Gears. We bought our first set at a local toy store. And Zoobs if you <br/>
can still find them. <br/>
We like Quiddler and Set and Walking with Dinosaurs and the Great States <br/>
Game. Pick Up Sticks and Dominos. There are two versions of Dominos that are <br/>
popular here, one is Spinners and the other is Tri-ominos. All the old <br/>
favorites; War, Slapjack, Uno, Skip-Bo, Go Fish, Old Maid, any of the <br/>
Monopoly versions out there, Scrabble, Jr., Pictionary, Jr., we like them <br/>
all. Order a set of Thinking Sticks from Sandra! Jack plays and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
look at the words, he has made up some super involved color game with them. <br/>
He wants me to order a special set from Sandra that just have colors and no <br/>
words. I told him I would buy some popsicle sticks for him and he could paint <br/>
them all by himself. (He doesn&#39;t believe me, he thinks Sandra has made them <br/>
in some special way. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>

He wants me to order a special set from Sandra that just have colors and no <br/>
words. I told him I would buy some popsicle sticks for him and he could paint <br/>
them all by himself. (He doesn&#39;t believe me, he thinks Sandra has made them <br/>

You can buy colored &quot;crafts sticks&quot; at art supply stores.  And you can buy <br/>
(or collect) plain-colored ones and paint them.  <br/>

That&#39;s all I do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
My daughters two favorite games are both Ravensburger...Amazing Labryinith and Enchanted forest.  They are so well, and beautifully made!   You can also get them from the internet via ebay, which is where I got both games.<br/>
<br/>
Missing instructions? There is a site.  It would take me some time tof find it but it is there...<br/>

that you have done something totally differential! &lt;bg&gt; Maybe its because it <br/>
came in the mail? Who knows what a 6yo thinks! But he is sure that his <br/>

him, and there is no way we could ever reproduce them. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
