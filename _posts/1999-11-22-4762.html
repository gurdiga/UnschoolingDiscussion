<div id="ygrps-yiv-764237384">I also am very skeptical about these labels.  My oldest son, when he <br/>
decided to try school one more time, was considered likely to meet the ADD <br/>
description by some of his teachers and by the vice principal, who told me <br/>
that he was ADHD himself and was doing so much better on Ritalin.  He said <br/>
one of the ways he knew he was ADHD was because when he would go to do <br/>
something, like put a tool away at home, he might spot something else on his <br/>
way back and start working on that when he hadn&#39;t even planned on it.  I <br/>
thought, &quot;Well, I must be ADHD, too, because that&#39;s how I do a lot of <br/>
things,&quot; but I have no desire to take a drug to try to change that.  <br/>
    My oldest son, Justin, has never been a &quot;hyper&quot; kid at all but they were <br/>
saying ADD because he didn&#39;t focus on what they wanted him to and daydreamed <br/>
instead of doing his work.  I never even considered getting him officially <br/>
diagnosed because I don&#39;t believe in the diagnosis or the treatment.  Since <br/>
he came back home to learn, he has no problems at all concentrating on the <br/>
things he&#39;s interested in for hours at a time.  He reads for hours, mixes <br/>
music on the computer for hours, etc.  <br/>
    I believe the whole ADD/ADHD thing is mainly about trying to make kids be <br/>
one type of learner or personality.  I don&#39;t have the knowledge to predict <br/>
any bad physical effects from years of Ritalin usage but it does worry me.  <br/>
It is a type of speed and it doesn&#39;t seem like a healthy thing to be on for <br/>
years.  I dated a guy when I was 21 who had a heart condition at 22 which <br/>
required him to take nitroglycerin sometimes.  He said that he had been <br/>
diagnosed &quot;hyperactive&quot; as a kid and had been on amphetamines for years <br/>
because of it.  He believed it had caused his heart condition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473009945">Heart problems are just one possible on a list two full columns long of<br/>
possible side effects with the use of Ritalin.  Also, the drug is clearly<br/>
marked for limited use and for juveniles.  Wonder how the adult principal<br/>
got someone to prescribe it for him???<br/>
