<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981473508">Hey Pam,<br/>
<br/>
When I saw your post I immediately called to find out how to make reservations.   I spoke to &quot;John&quot; and he said that ever since Rand McNally Company bought Thomas Guide, they no longer give tours.   In fact the printing and assembling of the books now take place at another factory close by.<br/>
<br/>
I love field trips and I remember as a teenager pouring over Thomas Guides with my Grandmother.   She would tell of places and people she had visited and I would look up the address and she would tell me stories about the area.   It was fun.  She love maps.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I sure wish I could have seen the plant.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane, even if I never did make it to the destination.<br/>

We went on a great tour there, some years ago. They make and print and <br/>
assemble the Thomas Guides there and they have a store with demos of <br/>
their computer software, etc.<br/>

If you want to arrange a tour, I bet we could interest some other <br/>
people - i know I&#39;d love to go back.&lt;<br/>
