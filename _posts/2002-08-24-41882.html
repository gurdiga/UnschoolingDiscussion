&lt;&lt; School starts this Thursday and I want to keep my son home<br/>
from school even though I haven&#39;t heard from the department of<br/>
education, yet. I will call them this Monday. I don&#39;t want to break the<br/>
law and get into that mess. Is it okay to keep him home?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can keep him home and say &quot;I applied to homeschool, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re <br/>
busy with the beginning of school, but since I don&#39;t intend to put him in <br/>
school it would be a waste of many people&#39;s time and resources for him to be <br/>
there for a few days and then gone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can say that to yourself, your relatives, anyone who asks, and the school <br/>
if they object.<br/>
<br/>
If you put him in they will charge you fees, they will issue him books, they <br/>
will give him a locker or a desk or a cubby or all of the above.  They will <br/>
put his name on all their lists and in their grade books.  He will have that <br/>
sinking feeling, and will receive lessons in what is educational.<br/>
<br/>
Keep him home.  <br/>
<br/>
Other temporary dodges include &quot;We&#39;re thinking of moving out of the state,&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I think we&#39;re leaving town in a day or two&quot; (and hey... there&#39;s always <br/>
just leaving town!!) and &quot;He&#39;s not feeling good and I&#39;m afraid of West Nile <br/>
Hunta Fecal Swamp Rot.&quot;<br/>

ROFL! Don&#39;t ya just hate when the kids get a dose of the old swamp rot?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I don&#39;t really think you will come to need any of Sandra&#39;s good <br/>
suggestions. You&#39;ve complied with the law and they&#39;re just behind on their <br/>
paperwork. That&#39;s all you&#39;ll need to tell them, should they ask. Which I <br/>
doubt they will.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
