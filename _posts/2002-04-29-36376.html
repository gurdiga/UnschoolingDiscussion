&gt; &gt; Why might conversations with no replies go away?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I should have said they come to an end. One person talking isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; converstaion. It&#39;s a monolog. And generally, inductively reasoning from<br/>
 </span></blockquote>past<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; behavior, people are looking for dialog.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you aren&#39;t using induction.  You&#39;ve *explained* that the posting stops<br/>
because monologues are boring and people tend to go seek dialogues<br/>
elsewhere instead.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Though occasionally, and I&#39;ve observed this also, some people do keep<br/>
&gt; posting. Perhaps, theorizing here, because they just enjoy seeing their<br/>
&gt; words appear even if no one is responding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, again, you&#39;ve used explanation.  You pointed out a flaw in the<br/>
previous explanation.  Some people like to hear themselves talk.  And for<br/>
these people, continuing after everyone else stops makes perfect sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve never observed it to<br/>
&gt; continue for long. Though I can&#39;t recall if it always stopped<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spontaneously<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or if it needed moderator intervention.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And now you&#39;ve come up with two explanations for why they eventually stop.<br/>
The first, although you didn&#39;t explicitly write it, is that although they<br/>
like listening to themselves talk, after a while they get bored of this.<br/>
<br/>
And the second is that moderators get bored first.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One way or the other we will add another data point to our collection.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Observations *are* useful.  They can critisize theories.  For example if<br/>
someone offered a theory that &quot;if you don&#39;t respond to trolls, they will<br/>
never continue to post&quot; and you remember an example of trolls who like to<br/>
hear themselves talk posting and posting, you could falsify the quiet-troll<br/>
theory by pointing to your observation.  For the quiet-troll theory to<br/>
survive, it would need to be changed to include an explanation of the<br/>
contrary trolls.  (Technically the quiet-troll theory is dead and this<br/>
would be quiet-troll theory 1.001a  A similar theory, but not the same one)</div>
