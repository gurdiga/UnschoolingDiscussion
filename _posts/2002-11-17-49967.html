<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (Speaking of ballads -- though maybe it&#39;s just a story with musical<br/>
&gt; accompaniment -- ironically I happened to pick up Arlo Guthrie&#39;s Greatest<br/>
&gt; Hits CD at the library with Alice&#39;s Restaurant on it last week. And even<br/>
&gt; more ironically, we serendipitously (though unfortunately before I&#39;d gotten<br/>
&gt; around to playing the CD for Kathryn) ended up in Stockbridge a couple days<br/>
&gt; later where &quot;Alice&#39;s restaurant&quot; was. Had I known we&#39;d be there and had<br/>
&gt; looked up the trivia about the song we could have seen the church (now<br/>
&gt; Guthrie Center) and the 8x10 color glossies (that were actually black and<br/>
&gt; white). And I can&#39;t figure out if the restaurant in the center that was<br/>
&gt; &quot;formerly Alice&#39;s Restaurant&quot; (closed either for the season or permanently<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t clear) was Alice&#39;s restaurant. (Alice&#39;s restaurant refered to in the<br/>
&gt; song was called The Wooden Spoon I think.) It&#39;s down an alley and not<br/>
&gt; &quot;around the back&quot; as in the song. Perhaps she moved it to the present<br/>
&gt; location later and renamed it Alice&#39;s Restaurant.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to know Alice&#39;s Restaurant Massacree by heart! I still quote parts, <br/>
and folks look at me as if I&#39;m crazy! Arlo&#39;s coming to the Newberry Opera <br/>
House (just outside Columbia) early next year. I already have my <br/>
tickets---and I&#39;m taking Cameron. So that when he&#39;s asked, &quot;Whatdya get?&quot; he <br/>
can answer, &quot;I didn&#39;t GET anything. I had to pay $25 and pick up the trash!&quot; &lt;<br/>
G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I need to get the CD!<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a newer version of it in which Arlo suggests that the length of the <br/>
original Alice&#39;s Restaurant recording is EXACTLY the length of the hole in <br/>
Nixon&#39;s tapes.  I guess the suggestion is he accidently recorded Alice&#39;s <br/>
Restaurant in there and then erased it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As featured in a newspaper article that&#39;s only available by subscription now <br/>
8-/<br/>
Holly, a few years back, had a &quot;hippie van&quot; in the back yard.  It was really <br/>
a non-running 15-passenger Ford with most of the back seats out.  She had <br/>
decorated it with Grateful Dead stuff, Mexican pottery art, fringe, beads, <br/>
and had a (non-period) CD player and used to listen to Alice&#39;s Restaurant, <br/>
Joni Mitchell, and such.  She painted the outside of it with peace signs and <br/>
rainbows.  It was described in the Albuquerque Journal when reporters came to <br/>
our unschooling meetings, twice, and wrote an article. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I should just scan that article in somewhere, and see if the Albuquerque <br/>
Journal bothers to sue me.<br/>
