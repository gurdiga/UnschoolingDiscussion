<div id="ygrps-yiv-461030347">HI RObin,I read Strong willed child or dreamer,and I really enjoyed that<br/>
book,if you don&#39;t have it yet,I would be happy to loan it to you,let me<br/>
know...Debbie in Va<br/>

&gt; So the question is... what are we reading?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I just got the 6th book in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series by Tim<br/>
&gt; LaHaye, so I&#39;ll be starting that right away. I&#39;ve been reading David<br/>
&gt; Albert&#39;s &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My daughter (age 10 and a huge Harry Potter fan) and I just finished<br/>
&gt; &quot;Castle in the Attic,&quot; and have started &quot;Wizard&#39;s Hall&quot; (the storyline<br/>
&gt; of this one sounds very similar to Harry Potter, but it was actually<br/>
&gt; written first).  She also just finished (after having only just<br/>
&gt; received) book #21 of the Magic Treehouse series, &quot;Civil War on<br/>
&gt; Sunday.&quot;  She also just read the first of the Magic School Bus chapter<br/>
&gt; books, &quot;The Truth About Bats.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On my summer reading list is Scott Turow&#39;s &quot;Personal Injuries,&quot; Mary<br/>
&gt; Hood &quot;Joyful Homeschooler,&quot; and &quot;Strong Willed Child or Dreamer&quot; by<br/>
&gt; Dr. Dana Scott Spears.  And of course, Harry Potter #4 when it comes<br/>
&gt; out!<br/>

I would love to hear more about &quot;Strong willed child or Dreamer&quot;.  I have <br/>
just finished the book &quot;Raising the spirited child&quot; which sounds like it goes <br/>
along the same lines as the first...The book I read was really good, and I <br/>
would recommend it to anyone who feels like life is one big battle with their <br/>
kids.  I liked it so well, I actually bought a copy.  I hardly ever buy any <br/>
books.<br/>

 My 12 yr. old DD loved the Harry Potter books as did<br/>
I. Look for a book call &quot;A Walk In Wolf Wood&quot; Similar<br/>
to the Harry Potter genre. I thought it was great! My<br/>
other DD age 8 loves the Magic Tree House series! She<br/>
reads whatever is in the library at the time! We will<br/>
look for the &quot;Wizard&#39;s Hall&quot; at the library today! And<br/>
we have already ordered the 4th Harry Potter at<br/>
B&N.com should be delivered the first week of July!<br/>
Only thing is who gets to read it first!LOL<br/>
Happy reading! Jill<br/>

Hi-- this book sounds like a good one ,too.  If you don&#39;t mind, could you <br/>
explain what it was your child was diagnosed with?  I have a very strong <br/>
willed son, and  he has always been very sensitive from day one, too.  What <br/>
is OCD?  I know what tourettes is.  How was his anxiety disorder diagnosed?  <br/>
I&#39;ve always thought  my son to be exactly as your  book describes: intense, <br/>
sensitive, perceptive, persistent, and energetic.   Since he is adopted, I am <br/>
not sure of all possible things he may have a predisposition for, but he does <br/>
seem to improving behaviorally as refined sugars are being eliminated from <br/>
his diet.  One thing I have noticed is that he is sleeping better, and not <br/>
getting up quite as early, which is good as he often gets so tired by mid <br/>
day.  He can be very shy, but at the same time, very controlling.  He is very <br/>
loving and sensitive, but also has a fiery temper and will launch himself <br/>
into a tantrum  over seemingly trivial things.  He is very intense!  Well, I <br/>
look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.                                      <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111096906">My son was diagnosed 4 years ago,With Mild tourettes,Obsessive<br/>
compulsive disorder,Oppositional defiant disorder,and anxiety<br/>
disorder.While I am not crazy about labels.It finally was a relief to<br/>
know why Nick was so Hard to raise.I raised 3 sons before him,and they<br/>
were easy compared to him since birth.Now with the Tourettes,most people<br/>
think of just the coprolalia which is the cursing,which only is evident<br/>
in a very small minority of tourettes cases.Actually the tourettes<br/>
itself present very challenging behaviour problems.With Nicks Obsessive<br/>
compulsive disorder,he doesn&#39;t have a problem with the cleanliness type<br/>
,he gets obsessive thoughts,for instance,before he was diagnosed he<br/>
would get bad thoughts that would race through his head,and he coudn&#39;t<br/>
control them,or if he gets an idea or plan in his head,he obsesses about<br/>
it,and drives all of us crazy in the process.Nick also can be very<br/>
shy,and at the same time controlling,Nick is also very loving and<br/>
sensitive and also has a fiery temper.I feel like I am living with Dr<br/>
Jekyl and Mr Hyde sometime.<br/>
I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have and I would<br/>
be more than happy to send you the 2 books to borrow for as long as you<br/>
would like.Deb :)<br/>

Your son sounds like my daughter.  I loved the book &quot;Raising your spirited <br/>
child&quot; I finally found a book that turns all those traits I could not stand <br/>
in my daughter and showed me how to look at them in a different light.  For <br/>
example, my daughter refuses, I mean REFUSES to take no as an answer.  After <br/>
reading the book, I am thinking that is going to be to her and my advantage <br/>
when she is a teen and has tons of peer pressure.  It also talks about <br/>
recongizing triggers that cause flare ups with spirited children.  It book is <br/>
on my top 10 favorite parenting books, and I have read probably <br/>
hundreds.(okay maybe only a 100).<br/>
<br/>
They have it in our public library so you might check there, or our local La <br/>
Leche League has it also.<br/>

aisles for .... I think $4.99 but it could have been $5.99 .<br/>
I bought it for myself last week as a birthday present to myself.<br/>
It has a Buddhist flavour(mindfulness, parenting in the moment) but is<br/>
meant for any parent(s) regardless of their religion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378824441">My husband and I enjoyed Piers Anthony books, the Xanth series.  There are <br/>
about 20 (or more, we are way behind...).  They are fantasy books with lots <br/>
of silly puns.  Dragons, castles and the like.  If she enjoys them, they <br/>
will keep her busy for a while...  (Our kids are only 5 and 3 so we don&#39;t <br/>
know if they will like them yet)<br/>

&gt;My son listened to The Castle in the Attic and The Battle for the Castle by<br/>
&gt;Elizabeth Winthrop on audiotape, says they are the best books ever!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also would recommend Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, very funny.<br/>
&gt;Levine also has a new book out, can&#39;t remember the name but saw it at the<br/>
&gt;library yesterday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Has she read The Hobbit?  Or Summer of My German Soldier?<br/>
