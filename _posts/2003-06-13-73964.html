<br/>
I truly understand wanting to get rid of them---and you&#39;ll want to even more, <br/>
the older they get (six weeks and older is murder!).  BUT. Taking them to <br/>
Petsmart will end up dumping them on some unsuspecting family who&#39;ll have no idea <br/>
what they&#39;re getting. Some mom and child will see these precious darlings and <br/>
take one home---without having even planned to get a puppy. The dad may be <br/>
mad and take it out on the pup. The novelty will wear off and the pup will wind <br/>
up ignored in the back yard.<br/>
<br/>
Put an ad in the paper: &quot;Mom, yellow lab. Dad, weekend Casanova --or Champion <br/>
fence climber--or something catchy. $50 donation will go to local shelter. <br/>
Pup MUST be spayed or neutered.&quot;   Put the ad in NOW. Don&#39;t let the pups go <br/>
until they&#39;re---minimum---eight weeks old. If folks call now and still want one in <br/>
two weeks, or whenever they&#39;re ready, then they REALLY want that puppy and <br/>
aren&#39;t just getting a puppy on a whim. A dog is a lifelong commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Make up a small contract---maybe they could pay $75 and get $25 back after <br/>
you see proof of spay/neuter. And by signing the contract, they agree to adore <br/>
the dog forever. &lt;g&gt; You can make it cute and fun.<br/>
<br/>
The shelter would appreciate it---and you could get your girl spayed too.<br/>
<br/>
Be responsible about the lives you have brought into this world. They ARE <br/>

weekends.  Each day has a different shelter.  So even if you take them to a <br/>
shelter they will probably get sold/adopted at Petsmart.  Petsmart here doesn&#39;t <br/>
sell dogs on it&#39;s own.  I have adopted a couple through Petsmart over the years <br/>
and they have done well and been loved. And I have known several families that <br/>
have done the same.<br/>

<br/>
Beagles aren&#39;t my first breed. I&#39;ve had crazy Weimaraners for years (about 18 <br/>
years, I think). Then a viszla (that I absolutely adored) and a pointer. When <br/>
they were stolen, I went off the deep end. When I was able to get another <br/>
dog, I got a rescue GSD. Then I went out to get a basenji or a French bulldog. I <br/>
came home with a beagle &#39;cause Cameron LOVES them. As much as I&#39;d like a <br/>
Frenchie or a basenji (Deb&#39;s cracking up, I know!) or maybe a Scottish deerhound or <br/>
a standard schnauzer, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m hooked on this little beagle! &lt;g&gt;  He&#39;s <br/>
just too damned cute! I want a six pack! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know full-well that they aren&#39;t for everybody! But no breed is. You <br/>
couldn&#39;t pay me to take a lab or golden. But he&#39;s so funny and easy. Sandra & Ren <br/>
have met him. He probably drove them crazy! &lt;g&gt; But I could look at and play with <br/>
him all day! &lt;G&gt; I would NOT have a field beagle though---I KNOW they&#39;re <br/>
NUTS!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy YOUR little Kelly! And remember, they are a LONG-lived breed! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

{in Durham NC} but because I hadn&#39;t had them all vaccinated with all <br/>
their shots {I personally don&#39;t believe in much more then a rabies <br/>
shot} they wouldn&#39;t &quot;endorse&quot; me trying to give them away there, and <br/>
basicly shunned me away. <br/>
Anyway, I would pre-check out how they stand on that type of thing <br/>
before taking them there. But they may ok it, if all your pups have <br/>
their shots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095640688">I was going to say all the stuff that Pam said.. LOL.  And also to clarify a <br/>
little bit about my vague statement as to &#39;staking out&quot; at Petsmart.    <br/>
Petsmart does allow animal rescue organizations show and adopt thier animals there.  <br/>
I have volunteered for one organization a few times and we adopted a puppy <br/>
from them before.  I know the folks personally and I would ask them if I could <br/>
bring my puppies along with thier rescued dogs one day.  They do have a <br/>
screening process,and require puppies to be spayed or neutered ( they give a coupon <br/>
for puppies that are too young to be sterilized.. puppies over 4 months are <br/>
already sterilized)    The adoption fee is $60, so, not a small chunk of change.  <br/>
Our puppies will be vaccinated and wormed, with vet records.  And the rescue <br/>
organization would keep the adoption fees.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not a breeder.  I am an irresponsible dog owner who neglected to get our <br/>
dog spayed before she got pregnant.    I read our local trade paper every <br/>
week, and there are 100s of puppies and dogs listed for free.    If someone DOES <br/>
want to pay me for a puppy, I have to let them come to my home and screen <br/>
them.   Personally, I do not want strangers coming to my house to see our puppies. <br/>
  That is just opening up a whole can of worms that I do not care to deal <br/>
with.   Of course, I could offer to meet folks at a public place to screen them, <br/>
but with 7 puppies( two are already spoken for), that is not going to be <br/>
feasible.. I have done this before when buying or selling something from the trade <br/>
paper and over half the time, the folks do not show.  I don&#39;t have the time to <br/>
deal with that either.  <br/>
<br/>
Petsmart may not be the absolute best way to find homes for the puppies, but <br/>
its a much better option than taking them to the pound or taking them to a <br/>
flea market.   Lots of folks go to Petsmart to find a dog to adopt from a rescue <br/>
organization.  That&#39;s what we did, we kept going back til we found a dog we <br/>
liked.   The truth is, you never REALLY know what kind of home your puppy is <br/>
going to.  Anyone can bs you about how they plan on treating a puppy.    I plan <br/>
on doing the best I can to find good homes for all of our sweet babies.<br/>

Just had a new wonderful little dog come up here {well my MIL next <br/>
door rescued him when she heard all these cars outside beeping their <br/>
horns and he was sitting in the middle of the road. He was COVERED <br/>
head to toe and big time in his ears with ticks and fleas} So we <br/>
cleaned him up got rid of all the parasites and have been watching <br/>
out for an owner.{looking at stores and the paper for lost ads, <br/>
because as I said we are for the same reasons very hesitent to put in <br/>
an ad reporting a lost dog}<br/>
If he has a loving family I will be very glad to hand him over. And <br/>
the kids know this upfront. Meanwhile he is getting lots of TLC and <br/>
excersise playing with the kids.<br/>
BTW I completely understand your position. As I say I had the little <br/>
{well big, he was a large full blooded huskey, and the people were <br/>
new to the neighborhood} visitor to a dog I had not long before taken <br/>
in. <br/>
FWIW, I am not judging you,{or Petsmart}. :-) Just wanted you to know <br/>
what happened when I showed up without asking them first. <br/>
Looks like you already have a much better relationship with them then <br/>
I did. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I honestly don&#39;t know if Petsmart, per se would let me bring my puppies <br/>
there to sell ( or give away).    I am going to go in on the coat tails of <br/>
the rescue group I know..   How I see it is this, these folks get puppies <br/>
&quot;dumped&quot; on them all the time.  They foot the bill for rescued animals vaccinations <br/>
and sterilzation.  What I will do is just ask them if I can bring my puppies <br/>
along with thier rescued dogs and dopt them out &quot;through&quot; them, and they keep <br/>
the fees.  I will do all the &quot;work&quot;, and the puppies will not have to be <br/>
fostered if they do not find homes.   Also, puppies are a good attraction to get <br/>
folks over to see the dogs up for adoption.  Folks may come over to see the <br/>
puppies, then end up finding an adult dog that suits them better.  So, its a win <br/>
win situation.  ( in my opinion)  <br/>
<br/>
  Actually, I am going to exhaust all of my other options before I contact <br/>
the rescue group.   Family, friends, word of mouth, that sort of thing among <br/>
folks I already know.. And THEN if I have any pups left, I&#39;ll do the Petsmart <br/>
thing.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;If someone DOES  want to pay me for a puppy, I have to let them come to my<br/>
home and screen<br/>
them.   Personally, I do not want strangers coming to my house to see our<br/>
puppies.<br/>
That is just opening up a whole can of worms that I do not care to deal<br/>
with.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I think you can only do a certain amount to make sure the puppy is going to a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes---they&#39;re quite wiley! But that&#39;s one more reason for putting a price <br/>
on the puppies---those folks don&#39;t want to pay. Also---if you get an address, <br/>
you can go by to see the potential home (and fence)---and check up on them <br/>
later. A longer &quot;waiting period&quot;---from the time you place the ad to the time <br/>
the pups are available will discourage a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
Someone you would not want in your house, you probably wouldn&#39;t want having a <br/>
puppy either.<br/>
<br/>
Contracts discourage them too.<br/>
<br/>
People bitch about the hassle of buying from a reputable breeder, but there&#39;s <br/>
A LOT of time and money that goes into breeding healthy, well-adjusted <br/>
puppies and screening the potential homes. We want every puppy&#39;s first home to be <br/>
his last home! And we go to great efforts to assure that that will happen. We <br/>
take the &quot;life-long responsiblity&quot; to heart---I&#39;m available for the LIFE of my <br/>
puppies, and I will take a puppy back even when he&#39;s 10 years old if the owner <br/>
can&#39;t keep him for ANY reason.<br/>
<br/>
Just because these are mutts does not lessen the responsibility the &quot;breeder&quot; <br/>
has---and that includes the new homes. <br/>

&gt; Mary B<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We used to list stuff( cars, bikes, etc) for sell in the local trade paper.  <br/>
We had so much hassle the few times we did it.. We swore we would never place <br/>
ads again.. Now we use EBAY to sell our stuff. Here are some real experiences <br/>
we had, and some possiblities for scenarios for placing an ad for the puppies.<br/>
<br/>
Dozens of calls from folks who can not read an ad clearly, who figure out <br/>
they don&#39;t want the kind of puppies we have after we answer the same facts that <br/>
were stated in the ad <br/>
<br/>
( example- Ad for 1974 240Z PARTS CAR-  No engine, all other parts in working <br/>
condition- you tow the car-$200.. Folks ( yes, MORE than one person) call and <br/>
ask &quot;Does the car run good? can I drive it home?  DUH!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Having to be home at appointed times for folks to NOT show up. You go through <br/>
several calls, mostly duds, then someone does actually want to come over.  <br/>
You spend time giving directions, setting up an appointment.   Stay at home and <br/>
wait... and wait.  And, they never show up. UGHGHGG.  Its usually always on a <br/>
weekend too.   This has happened more times than I can count.  Also, going to <br/>
meet folks and they don&#39;t show up.  OR driving an hour to meet them and THEN <br/>
they figure out &quot;its not what they wanted&quot;  DH did this with a bike that he had <br/>
clearly described every detail to the guy.   That took out about 4 hours of <br/>
time he could have been doing something &quot;good&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shady characters&quot; showing up and basically casing the joint to see if there <br/>
is anything they can come back for<br/>
<br/>
One guy came to look at a car we had for sell.  He walked all around our <br/>
house.. Asked to go in the basement ( DH declined).  He went in our garage to look <br/>
at a car that was NOT for sell.   He was just &quot;weird&quot;   DH said he got a bad <br/>
feeling about him.  Might be a coincidence, but that night, the dogs went wild <br/>
barking.. obvious warning barks... DH got up to see what the commotion was, <br/>
and he saw someone run across the yard to a car parked in the lot of the store <br/>
next to us- CREEPY!<br/>
<br/>
Folks being offended if I ask too many questions.  If folks are giving you <br/>
money for something, they usually feel like its none of your business what they <br/>
are going to do with the &quot;thing&quot;   Keep in mind, we live in RURAL NC.   :-)  <br/>
.. &quot;Well, hell, you want $50 for this pup, what  do you cire what I do with it, <br/>
you got your money.. I&#39;m agonna make hit into me a huntin dog, and if he does <br/>
good, I got me a few bitches I might stand him to&quot;  .. OK.. so I don;t sell <br/>
him the dog.. I saved the pup, but I also wasted a lot of my time and pissed <br/>
off some redneck hunter.<br/>
<br/>
Folks who do not speak english that I couldn&#39;t communicate with anyway,so why <br/>
try to &quot;screen&quot; them<br/>
<br/>
(example- someone calls-  spanish, spanish, spanish, spanish, Car?... you may <br/>
even get enough basic communication to make an appointment.. then when they <br/>
get there.. spanish spanish spanish spanish How much?.. and we never actually <br/>
sold the car to a non-english speaking person.  Don&#39;t ask me why, I don&#39;t speak <br/>
spanish)<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has been &quot;invited&quot; on to my property &quot;getting hurt&quot; and suing me <br/>
( a common scam)<br/>
<br/>
(example- Guy comes over to look at our station wagon we had for sell. ( TRUE <br/>
STORY).   The car burns oil, smokes ( as stated in the ad)  He decides he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want it. .Comes back 3 days later and tells me he had to go to the <br/>
hospital for an asthma attack because of the smoke from the car when he cranked it <br/>
up!!  It didnt even smoke when he cranked it up!!.  He hustled me for money to <br/>
pay for his ER visit..  Threatened suing.. I didn&#39;t buy it though, and refused <br/>
to give him $$..  He was just hustling me, but still, NOT  a pleasant <br/>
experience)<br/>
<br/>
Joy and Skippy ( our other dog) freaking out when strangers come on our <br/>
property ( esp now that Joy is a protective Moma)<br/>
<br/>
(One man came to look at a bike that Skippy did NOT like.. I don&#39;t know why, <br/>
he has never bitten anyone.. and he didnt bite this man either.. but he sure <br/>
acted like he was going to  He did the &quot;bark and hold&quot; routine.. wouldnt let <br/>
the man take a step.  We couldnt even pick Skippy up he was so riled up.  The <br/>
guy just left.. Even when the mailman comes to deliver a package, they act like <br/>
they are going to tear them up)<br/>
<br/>
The fact that meeting someone for a short visit and asking them a few <br/>
questions will not gaurantee they will give the puppy a good home.   There is no way <br/>
I can really ascertain what kind of people some are just by taking thier money <br/>
and asking them a few questions.  And all of the above hassles I stated are <br/>
NOT worth the chance that they MIGHT be good dog owners.  I&#39;de rather take that <br/>
chance without going through all of the trouble of placing an ad.  Trouble <br/>
that inconveniences and puts MY FAMILY at risk, whom, ultimately, are more <br/>
important that the puppies.<br/>

Yesterday Landon took Joy to work with him on the farm.   It was the first <br/>
extended time the puppies have had away from their Moma.   They were all fine, <br/>
they didnt really even act like they knew she was gone. After all, they have <br/>
plenty of sibs to keep them company.  When I brought Landon home, the puppies <br/>
were lined up along the walk watching the van intently.  You could see the <br/>
tentative looks in thier eyes.. Thier ears perked up, thier tails barely wagging.. <br/>
They were watching so closely to make sure they knew the folks who got out of <br/>
the van.   I opened the door and they  got that OH YAYYY, its you look on <br/>
thier face and started to trot towards me.  Then, Landon let Joy out of the van <br/>
and she ran around the front.  As soon as the puppies saw her, they broke into a <br/>
full on run towards her.. with thier little bodies just shaking with <br/>
excitement.   They literally attacked her jumping on her, licking her, welcoming her <br/>
home.   I swear, I think they had forgotten about her til they saw her.. LOL.  <br/>
But it was sooo cute to see them so happy to see thier moma.   She even laid <br/>
down and let them nurse a while.   It was such a wonderful sight to see the <br/>
puppies greeting their moma  with such enthusiasm and excitement.  It was so much <br/>
just like a child  running to his moma after being seperated from her for a <br/>
while.  <br/>

Some stake their dogs out so they don&#39;t get hit by a car. Hunting dogs are <br/>
bred for being quick and for their nose.  A good hunting dog puts its nose to <br/>
the ground and doesn&#39;t look up until they loose the sent.<br/>
Many choose to steak rather than to zap with ecollars. <br/>
 <br/>
I am on a Brittany list and several people have lost their dogs this way. It <br/>
can take up to two years to fully train a good pup and training some things <br/>
too soon will break a dog. Some over breed/poor breeders mix two dogs with hyper <br/>
tendencies and the owner ends up with a hard to handle dog. <br/>
 <br/>
I have two Brits and a Shepherd lab mix. The Brits are not on a run but the <br/>
mixed dog is when he goes potty. He runs right across the street to the <br/>
neighbors Border Collies and he doesn&#39;t look when he crosses the street. (haven&#39;t <br/>
figured out how to teach that one yet)<br/>
On another note I do have other neighbors who chain their Chow mix and <br/>
another all day and night year round (even in snow storms that we get here in Maine. <br/>
That&#39;s the same dog that bit my son. Im guessing that is the kind of staked <br/>
dogs you are talking about. <br/>

  home.   I swear, I think they had forgotten about her til they saw her.. LOL.  <br/>
  But it was sooo cute to see them so happy to see thier moma.   She even laid <br/>
  down and let them nurse a while.   It was such a wonderful sight to see the <br/>
  puppies greeting their moma  with such enthusiasm and excitement.  It was so much <br/>
  just like a child  running to his moma after being seperated from her for a <br/>
  while.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, maybe I shouldnt have said &quot;hunting dogs&quot;  Although, I know there are <br/>
some very good hunting dog owners, and this is NOT a stereotype,  but most <br/>
hunters around here do not treat thier dogs all that well.  It is very common for <br/>
hunters to beat thier dogs with  dead rabbits, squirrels  or coons to &quot;train&quot; <br/>
them to hunt.  Dogs are staked out, yes,so they won&#39;t run away or get run <br/>
over. But, they are also never let off to exercise except when it&#39;s huntin time.  <br/>
They live in thier own feces, sometimes with no shade.   THAT is the kind of <br/>
folks homes I am talking about are &quot;rough&quot; places.<br/>
