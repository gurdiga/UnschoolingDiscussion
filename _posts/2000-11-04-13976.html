<div id="ygrps-yiv-361468002">Smaller and smaller, I use to live in Portland which is my second favorite<br/>
city.  Do they still have enough movie theaters and real theaters so you<br/>
could go to see a movie or play everynight and not every have to see a<br/>
repeat??<br/>
<br/>
Love the zoo AND does Burger King still have the antique carousel???<br/>
