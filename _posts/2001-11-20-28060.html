<br/>
Ah, and this is where you are a better mother ....I am not convinced I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have moved onto the kid&#39;s candy.  ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>husband <br/>
or I go to the store we ask each other and kids if there&#39;s anything they <br/>
need.  Kirby usually requests shampoo or toiletries.  Holly asks for <br/>
vegetables and fruit.  Marty often says  nothing, or pizza, or avocados or <br/>
chips.  Mostly they say nothing, but there&#39;s usually food.  If Holly runs out <br/>
of Ramen she wants more.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re out and about, before we head out of a store or for home, I&#39;ll ask <br/>
Julian if there&#39;s anything he needs or wants. Most of the time the answer is <br/>
no. If it&#39;s yes, he really wants it, and most of the time it&#39;s no problem--I <br/>
just get it. If I don&#39;t have the money, or there&#39;s some other reason, I just <br/>
tell him, and again...no problem.  He never whines or begs, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel he HAS to get something every time we&#39;re out, just because.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we spend lots of time with other kids who seem to. <br/>
Sometimes the parents seem to say no just because the kid wants it. It&#39;s a <br/>
rough situation...you&#39;re less inclined to *want* to get something for a <br/>
nagging kid, and maybe the kid is more inclined to want stuff if it&#39;s rare.<br/>
<br/>
I have no answers. Maybe Juls is like this because stuff isn&#39;t scarce...maybe <br/>
he&#39;s just a mellow, kind kid. Because he&#39;d also have eaten the candy quickly <br/>
(though he would share, willingly.) He&#39;s a MAJOR sugar fiend, even though <br/>
it&#39;s also not scarce. He just REALLY likes it. And he doesn&#39;t brush his teeth <br/>
spontaneously, at the age of twelve, so we remind him. On the other hand, he <br/>
takes great care of the cats, his parents, etc...Priorities, I guess....<br/>
<br/>
This is rambling, but thinking of &quot;nudges&quot; given...Julian shared that he <br/>
likes when he has written (not necessarily the process of writing itself), so <br/>
I periodically remind him of that, then he does what he wants...writes or <br/>
not. Lately he&#39;s been writing. I&#39;m psyched.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760843779">Milanos, candy, cheesecake, chocolate chunk brownies. How&#39;s that for an <br/>
attention grabber?<br/>
<br/>
To Sandra and others who mentioned that they can polish off a bag of <br/>
milanos or candy, I have a real question for you. I know everyone&#39;s <br/>
different, and that their reasons for being attracted to certain foods <br/>
may be different, but the idea of some foods being &quot;just foods&quot; and <br/>
others being &quot;eat all up right away/in a few days&quot; is driving me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Do you buy those things all the time, or do you limit when you buy <br/>
them? I mean any food that you can gobble right down. If I buy them <br/>
(candy/cookies/cake/whatever) we eat them all up right away within a <br/>
couple of days to the exclusion of healthier foods. <br/>
<br/>
Do you buy them once in a while, or hardly ever, or do you even think <br/>
about them in the store? <br/>
<br/>
I sound obsessed with food, and right now I am. I am trying so hard to <br/>
figure out healthy things to eat to get my life back. I have been free <br/>
of most junk for a few days now, and feel alot better, but I still <br/>
would eat junk before I would eat the healthy stuff if it was in the <br/>
house. These foods are not the total cause of obesity, but they are a <br/>
big part of eating beyond normal satisfaction for me and many others. <br/>
Eating even when you&#39;re not hungry. Somehow they bypass the normal <br/>
appetite regulation system, and you eat more than your body needs.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my food was a problem when I was growing up. We didn&#39;t <br/>
restrict foods that I can remember. I had no desire to rebel growing up <br/>
because I really liked my parents. I felt like they were fair and <br/>
always treated me like a person. We had junk around the house sometimes <br/>
and it never lasted long. My dad could let a candy bar get dusty, but <br/>
mom and I finished ours on the way home from the store.<br/>
<br/>
I want to balance out my brain chemistry so I can let the candy bar get <br/>
dusty.<br/>
<br/>

ps-I read part of an interesting book about the similarities between <br/>
addictions (there&#39;s that word again) to food, alcohol, and drugs, and <br/>
the links to certain levels of seratonin (the feel good chemical) in <br/>
the brain. It has a goofy title, but very interesting research and <br/>
thoughts inside of it. I never dieted, and I hate the idea for many <br/>
reasons, but this book is not about any wacky diet. This link to amazon <br/>
for the book is not to sell it. It is because it is the handiest way <br/>
for me to convey the most info about the book in one link.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t keep stuff I bought just for me all the time.  It&#39;s rare, maybe once <br/>
a month or less.  Stuff the kids request (Kirby likes Red Vines) probably <br/>
doesn&#39;t get bought even that often, but it&#39;s partly because he can make a <br/>
pack of Red Vines last a long, long time.   (Holly told me that Kirby still <br/>
has some of his Halloween candy from three years ago.)<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t crave sweets.  The sweets have never been held out to them as a <br/>
metaphorical carrot, nor have they been marked evil and dangerous.  For the <br/>
kids, it&#39;s just food.   For me, there&#39;s the internal dialog based on my own <br/>
history.  <br/>
<br/>
When my husband and I was first living together 20+ years or so ago (it took <br/>
a few years for us to be living together full time, so between 20 and 24 <br/>
years when we were transitional), he would finish all the food in the house.  <br/>
His diet had been so measured and controlled and consisted of beef tongue and <br/>
liver and other &quot;good for you&quot; things his mom inflicted on people that when <br/>
he had freedom he would binge bigtime.  It took him years to get to the point <br/>
that he could leave food, trusting it would still be there the next day.  So <br/>
I used to get really frustrated if I&#39;d bring in something I wanted to have <br/>
some of in a few days; it didn&#39;t happen for me.  But he gradually got over <br/>
almost all of his food weirdness.  His latest hurdle was not freaking if the <br/>
last portion of something got moldy or leftovers dried up in the fridge.   He <br/>
used to agonize over the end parts of a head of lettuce, if we hadn&#39;t <br/>
finished it all before it went bad.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; attitude toward food is vastly different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124760153">With all the talk of control issues about food, here&#39;s a bit of irony <br/>
for you;<br/>
While I watch and monitor everything my son eats, we have a housefull <br/>
of junk food.  I bought a bunch of stuff to take camping because it&#39;s <br/>
easier to pack poptarts and such.  We brought most of it back home.  <br/>
That was seven weeks ago.  I ate a poptart last night.  We still have <br/>
more than half of them.  We also have four bags of CreamSavers, with <br/>
one or two of each flavor missing.  A large tub of dye free lollies <br/>
with about a fourth missing and bunches of other kinds of candy in <br/>
various amounts.  We also have several boxes of little debbie snacks <br/>
that refill the snack basket when needed, which are the fastest mover <br/>
because the exchange student snacks on them.<br/>
We used to all be big bingers.  We aren&#39;t so much anymore.  I think <br/>
it is because we worked it out of our systems.  <br/>
<br/>
On another slightly related note, if I ate the way my 16 yo does, <br/>
even when I WAS 16, I would weight 300 pounds.  She doesn&#39;t.  She <br/>
lost weight recently and while the weight was going away she was <br/>
polishing off gallons of ice cream and pints of sour cream.  Diet is <br/>
an extremely comlicated and personal thing.  I truly believe we have <br/>
to each listen to our bodies and find what works.  The problem an <br/>
allergic person faces is learning to distinguish between our body <br/>
talking and our allergy talking.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I never have. She goes to bed when she&#39;s tired, just like the rest of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; do. We&#39;re probably one of the few families in America who have never had<br/>
&gt; &gt; a fight over bedtime...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t generally fight about it either.  She gets to read or play in bed<br/>
&gt; and she often falls asleep doing so.  At our house though some of us don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go to bed when we are tired....we stay up on the computer or reading or<br/>
&gt; watching TV &lt;gasp, smile&gt; and need someone to urge us into bed.  If she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really into something and wants to, she can stay up a little longer and we<br/>
&gt; just turn off the light at the same time...so it&#39;s like trading the in bed<br/>
&gt; reading/playing time for whatever she was doing.  Probably more parental<br/>
&gt; involvement here on our part than some of you.  (but, that&#39;s OK I tell the<br/>
&gt; woman in the mirror, smile)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asks to beexcused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all<br/>
&gt; &gt; of this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; gasp<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; , it&#39;s a &#39;bad&#39; thing?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Neither of us ask to be excused, we might say &quot;excuse me&quot;. OTOH, I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked her to bring her dishes into the kitchen, or to make a &quot;dish run&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and round up any other dishes left in the living room, or carry a basket<br/>
&gt; &gt; full of laundry to the bedroom since she&#39;s going there... and she rarely<br/>
&gt; &gt; says no and if so, there&#39;s a good reason. I think the key is ask,<br/>
&gt; &gt; though... she certainly could say no, but she doesn&#39;t... we&#39;re just used<br/>
&gt; &gt; to working together and helping each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yep, it&#39;s a request, and she does once in a while say, &#39;no thank you&#39;, but<br/>
&gt; she usually does bring them in.  The asking to leave the table thing...oh,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s just so bred into us!  Hmmmm....I&#39;ll think on letting that go...<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s only instituted during dinner...other meals/snacks she can generally<br/>
&gt; come and go as she pleases....hmmmm....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of  that<br/>
&gt; &gt; event<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hour<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt; engage in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; walk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tv.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you think that that might have had more to do with your being in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; state of grief and perhaps less available than formerly? Ah, wait, I see<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>
&gt; &gt; self-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; often stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes.  Could be it.  Maybe if it had continued she would have turned them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; herself.  I&#39;m not sure why I blame the TV solely...as I said to Sandra...I<br/>
&gt; might not be willing to admit that grief got in the way....that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &#39;there&#39; for her...  But, it was a very interesting time...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It also sounds like pretty typical 1 1/2 yr old developmental stuff,<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially is you were starting to expect her to do chores at that age.<br/>
&gt; &gt; :-/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh!  I think you have the wrong picture here....chores is a very broad<br/>
&gt; word....  I wasn&#39;t asking her to chop wood (we heat with it) or make her<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I could bounce a quarter off it!  It was (what I consider)<br/>
&gt; developmentally appropriate stuff...like, here Em, help mommy put away all<br/>
&gt; your sand toys back in the sand box before we go back inside....  She&#39;d<br/>
&gt; throw herself on the ground and scream during the TV binge time and hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; done that prior to it.  Yes, yes, yes...there could have been other<br/>
&gt; influences, coincidentally occuring at the same time....  But, don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; she had a chore list and I was freaking out because she wasn&#39;t doing them<br/>
&gt; while saying &quot;Yes, m&#39;am&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And you never ask your kids to pick  up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room<br/>
&gt; &gt; floor and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sure you can ask, as long as it&#39;s asking and not commanding. Often<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; say ask when they mean command. Asking implies that the answer could be<br/>
&gt; &gt; no...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ask means ask for me.  Commands are only used in emergency safety<br/>
&gt; issues...like &quot;STOP!&quot; when she runs at top speed along the top of the<br/>
&gt; playground equipment toward the unprotected edge over which she&#39;d drop to<br/>
&gt; certain injury....used very rarely and mostly during that scarey time when<br/>
&gt; she could walk and run all over but had no sense of what would happen if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; plummeted....  We generally think it&#39;s better to fall out of tree and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>break<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an arm than to never climb a tree...but we do have some limits to this.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, yes, generally she&#39;s asked...sometimes, if I need the house picked<br/>
&gt; up (so I can impress people with how clean it is, as if no one actually<br/>
&gt; lives here) then it&#39;s less negotiable....but I always help her if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; possible and she wants help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We have always talked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fit. It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; disagree)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s a kind of simplistic truth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, but it worked really well when she was 1 1/2.  We do talk more now<br/>
&gt; about energy levels, but we haven&#39;t reached the point of researching<br/>
 </span></blockquote>carbs.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She&#39;s only 3 1/2 and it&#39;s really not a big issue for her.  She gets the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>junk<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at her granparents&#39; or friends&#39; houses and occasionally at ours or at a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; likes them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have also noticed that she tends to get emotionally<br/>
&gt; &gt; overwrought more easily if she hasn&#39;t had food in a while, especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; protein... my brother was like this as a kid, so I&#39;m a little familiar<br/>
&gt; &gt; with it, although I can go a day without eating and not feel any ill<br/>
&gt; &gt; effects.So, I&#39;ve spent years now trying to point out the connection and<br/>
&gt; &gt; she&#39;s pretty good now about grabbing some food when she&#39;s feeling that<br/>
&gt; &gt; way... of course, it&#39;s not a sure thing, sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat for<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours and is fine, but if she does feel sad for no reason it&#39;s often a<br/>
&gt; &gt; clue..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes!  THis happens to both my DD and I.  Hubby can go for hours and hours<br/>
&gt; without eating and be fine!<br/>

&gt; Here is my thought on all this:<br/>

&gt; did I have a time limit on television?  Would my kids just sit in front of<br/>
&gt; the television all day, even when I had other interesting things available<br/>
&gt; for them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did I have to deny my kids soda?  Or by talking with them about healthy<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think unschooling/unparenting is necessarily about &quot;you have to do<br/>
&gt; it this prescribed way&quot;, but about questioning your motives, checking out<br/>
&gt; alternatives, giving kids as much freedom as is absolutely possible.<br/>
&gt; Example:  My 8 and 4 yo today had taken the mattress off the bottom bunk<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>

&gt; sliding down.  These 2 do this kind of stuff and it isn&#39;t a big deal to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but most moms I know would have a cow about how they could get hurt (I do<br/>
&gt; remind the kids to be careful because bonked heads hurt).-----but my 3yo<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t allowed to play out front by himself.  He has no fear at all and<br/>
&gt; simply follows various wildlife off into the undeveloped land around us.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We<br/>

&gt; do go outside with him daily out front, take walks into the surrounding<br/>
&gt; land, let him play independently in the fenced backyard. but I also know<br/>
&gt; that I am in charge of where he plays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, thats my take.  I want to always question myself, to try to figure<br/>
&gt; out a way that the kids can do things they want safely, even if it is a<br/>
&gt; little scary for me, rather than simply deny them, to be open to their<br/>

&gt; Hmm...What if everyone in the house said &#39;no thank you&#39; to doing the<br/>
&gt; dishes?  You would have a pretty messy house pretty soon.  If a child<br/>
&gt; lives in the home and gets all the benefits of being in the home, why<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t the child do his/her fair share of the housework?  Is it<br/>
&gt; fair to let one (or two) people do all of the housework?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Yep, it&#39;s a request, and she does once in a while say, &#39;no thank<br/>
&gt; you&#39;, but<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure you can ask, as long as it&#39;s asking and not commanding.<br/>
&gt; Often people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say ask when they mean command. Asking implies that the answer<br/>
&gt; could be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if your child never cleans up his food or throws away his trash<br/>
&gt; and a social worker comes into your home and asks why the house is<br/>
&gt; unsanitary, are you just going to say, &quot;Oh, he decided he didn&#39;t want<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330592502">Briefly, here is my experience with ice cream:  The first word to ever<br/>
come out of my mouth as a toddler was &quot;creme&quot; (ice cream, in french).  I<br/>
said it as I was stroking the freezer.  From that day on, it has been my<br/>
favorite food (coffee ice cream, especially).  For decades, it could not<br/>
be in the freezer without me gobbling it up.  Not a day would go by<br/>
without me eating a BIG bowl after dinner.<br/>
<br/>
During the last 10 years, I have found that, with just a little bit of<br/>
will-power, if I don&#39;t eat any ice cream for 3 or 4 days (that&#39;s all it<br/>
takes), I stop craving it.  I am even able to keep it in the freezer and<br/>
dish it out to my children without taking a taste - and somehow, it&#39;s<br/>
not that hard to do.  I&#39;m very proud of myself.  I believe sugar is<br/>
truly addictive, but in my personal case, it doesn&#39;t take long to break<br/>
that addiction.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Sandra and others who mentioned that they can polish off a bag of<br/>
&gt; milanos or candy, I have a real question for you. I know everyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; different, and that their reasons for being attracted to certain foods<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; may be different, but the idea of some foods being &quot;just foods&quot; and<br/>
&gt; others being &quot;eat all up right away/in a few days&quot; is driving me nuts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you buy those things all the time, or do you limit when you buy<br/>
&gt; them? I mean any food that you can gobble right down. If I buy them<br/>
&gt; (candy/cookies/cake/whatever) we eat them all up right away within a<br/>
&gt; couple of days to the exclusion of healthier foods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you buy them once in a while, or hardly ever, or do you even think<br/>
&gt; about them in the store?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sound obsessed with food, and right now I am. I am trying so hard to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; figure out healthy things to eat to get my life back. I have been free<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; of most junk for a few days now, and feel alot better, but I still<br/>
&gt; would eat junk before I would eat the healthy stuff if it was in the<br/>
&gt; house. These foods are not the total cause of obesity, but they are a<br/>
&gt; big part of eating beyond normal satisfaction for me and many others.<br/>
&gt; Eating even when you&#39;re not hungry. Somehow they bypass the normal<br/>
&gt; appetite regulation system, and you eat more than your body needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think my food was a problem when I was growing up. We didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; restrict foods that I can remember. I had no desire to rebel growing<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; because I really liked my parents. I felt like they were fair and<br/>
&gt; always treated me like a person. We had junk around the house<br/>
&gt; sometimes<br/>
&gt; and it never lasted long. My dad could let a candy bar get dusty, but<br/>
&gt; mom and I finished ours on the way home from the store.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to balance out my brain chemistry so I can let the candy bar<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; dusty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kathy B.<br/>
&gt; ps-I read part of an interesting book about the similarities between<br/>
&gt; addictions (there&#39;s that word again) to food, alcohol, and drugs, and<br/>
&gt; the links to certain levels of seratonin (the feel good chemical) in<br/>
&gt; the brain. It has a goofy title, but very interesting research and<br/>
&gt; thoughts inside of it. I never dieted, and I hate the idea for many<br/>
&gt; reasons, but this book is not about any wacky diet. This link to<br/>
&gt; amazon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116706398">Hi everyone and Meghan,<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone goes on any specialty diet, it is very important to <br/>
research what that particular diet can do to your body. It could help <br/>
to read what McDougall and others say on the subject of <br/>
hunger, diets and ketosis. He is not the final word, but he makes a lot <br/>
of sense. My point is research alot, not just the person who is selling <br/>
you the diet. You don&#39;t want to damage your body <br/>
or self image based on claims of a miracle cure from someone who&#39;s <br/>
trying to make money off of you. Alot of times ordinary people will <br/>
even recommend a diet that didn&#39;t work for them, <br/>
because they want to justify their choice. They still want to believe <br/>
that the diet is a miracle, and it only might not have worked this time <br/>
for them because they weren&#39;t strong enough to stay <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Diets that are wacky just don&#39;t work in the long run. They set you up, <br/>
and blame you for failure. Wacky as in starvation levels of calories, <br/>
strict portion controls, or anything that drives you <br/>
nuts to stay on it so that you go off it and gain more back. To be a <br/>
real change for life it has to be sustainable and make you feel better <br/>
to be on it than off.<br/>
<br/>
People who sell diets/books/pills/programs make tons of money from our <br/>
belief that if only we were stronger the diets would work. That it&#39;s <br/>
always our fault. <br/>
<br/>
I think it could help to do your own research on nutrition. On what <br/>
elements the body needs to run and what sugar/caffeine/refined flours <br/>
and other common foods do to your metabolism. <br/>
Some people are affected more than others. Mostly it&#39;s an energy roller <br/>
coaster though and best to stay off. The real fuel for our bodies seems <br/>
to be some protein (but not excessive amounts <br/>
that your body/kidneys has to work overtime to flush out of your system <br/>
taking calcium and other nutrients with it.), plenty of water (for your <br/>
lungs, blood, brain, and digestion), maybe <br/>
some added fats (that&#39;s debated alot), and mostly Complex Carbohydrates <br/>
such as: <br/>
<br/>
Vegetables, fruit (some people do better with little or no fruit for <br/>
many reasons), Super Vegetables (like broccoli that has calcium and <br/>
vitamin C, cabbage, cauliflower), and the Color <br/>
Vegetables (dark green leafy, and dark orange or yellow like squash and <br/>
yams). Protein can be found plenty in plant sources, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
overtax the body with all the baggage of meat <br/>
(cholesterol, fat, hormones, antibiotics, guilt). Whole grains are <br/>
important foods too, and potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t really make alot of money telling people to go vegan. It&#39;s <br/>
just not glamorous or marketable. There are no flashy charts, systems, <br/>
special packages, or pills. It&#39;s just basic <br/>
nutrition. People want a new idea, some miracle science cure pill. The <br/>
easy part is you can eat whenever you want, as much as you want to <br/>
satisfaction, lose weight, and feel great.<br/>
<br/>
So try going vegan for a few months. Get rid of sugar and flour also if <br/>
you want to lose the extra pounds. Your body, pocket book, and the <br/>
environment will be better off for the change.<br/>
<br/>

argument with almost everyone he knew, when I asked him whether he thought <br/>
the diet might be part of that (since another couple of his partners in <br/>
dieting seemed also to feel like their lives had turned to flaming crap).  It <br/>
was way past two weeks, and he was getting worse, not better.  <br/>

A way of life in a human that avoids foods that are naturally found by <br/>
hunters and gatherers doesn&#39;t seem to be headed in a natural direction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824519224">Yes.  Definitely.  The Atkins way of eating is a way of life.  Reading<br/>
his books changed my whole outlook on food and what my body needs as an<br/>
animals.  I grew up as practically a vegetarian and as an adult ate many<br/>
years as a vegan and later I was into a macrobiotic diet.  I totally<br/>
avoided meat.  I was also, for years, anemic (sp?) and could hardly ever<br/>
donate blood or plateletts, which was important to me.<br/>
<br/>
 After reading Atkins and after over 40 years of being primarily<br/>
vegetarian and eating very little meat or dairy, I have made a complete<br/>
turnaround.  I now concentrate on the proteins and avoid many of the<br/>
carbohydrates.  Especially, the pastas, potatoes, rice and beans which I<br/>
loved.  I now eat lots of eggs and don&#39;t limit my consumption of meats<br/>
at all.  I allow myself most of the veggies except stuff like corn and<br/>
peas.  I eat lots of salad and other veggies like broccolli and<br/>
spinach.  I also avoid fruits.  I also take supplement vitamins and<br/>
minerals.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that this new diet works very well for me.  I feel much<br/>
stronger.  I swim faster and I am no longer anemic.  I can now donate<br/>
plateletts every week.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had read Atkins years ago.  He&#39;s been around since the 70&#39;s,<br/>
you know.  And, yes my cholesterol level is low, as it has always been.<br/>
