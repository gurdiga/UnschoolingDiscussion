 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Where are your other children during nap times?<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to keep a silent house for a long time.<br/>
My baby(she&#39;s 3 now) can sleep through *anything*, with 3 older<br/>
siblings in the house.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When my first was born, I would tiptoe around the house and keep it dark and <br/>
barely breath. Thought she would get her best sleep like that. Well she did <br/>
as long as there was no noise. Someone would ring my doorbell and she&#39;d wake <br/>
up and scream bloody murder.<br/>
<br/>
When I had my second, I made sure not to keep the house like a morgue. It <br/>
really worked out well. It was like the whole restriction thing. As long as <br/>
I didn&#39;t keep the noise away, it didn&#39;t bother my son or the two that <br/>
followed. Thankfully the last one hasn&#39;t proved me wrong as I couldn&#39;t keep <br/>
the house silent now if my life depended on it!!!<br/>

with my first born.<br/>
My mom, years later when discussing me as a new mom, compared me to a <br/>
mother cat; overprotective!<br/>
Everything had to be perfect.<br/>
Now with my forth, I can really appreciate how much harder I made it <br/>
on myself back then.  My poor dh didn&#39;t have a clue as how to handle <br/>
anything, and everything he did wasn&#39;t good enough.  I was such an <br/>
IDIOT!  LOL (I blame it on youth and hormones)<br/>
