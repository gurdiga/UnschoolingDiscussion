<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692280285">Michael wrote off list to say (in response to my comment about unschooling<br/>
children not being sheltered) ) that he was not talking about unschooled<br/>
children being sheltered, he was talking about the unschooling parents.  I&#39;d<br/>
rather keep it on list.  My response to that  (and I can only speak for<br/>
myself) is that I personally read in depth about all the variety of<br/>
different ways people home school and I chose unschooling based on that<br/>
research.  Unschooling was not the first home schooling method that I read<br/>
about nor the last.  I still find it interesting to read about how other<br/>
people homeschool.  I just know that unschooling works wonderfully for my<br/>
family.  <br/>

It&#39;s about the dumbest idea ever!  WHO is sheltering unschooling <br/>
parents?  How can they possibly be limited to only one stream of ideas <br/>
in our media-rich and diverse world?  How?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456169390">I can only speak from personal experience but over here certainly <br/>
(UK) if people discover you&#39;re a Home Educator you get to hear their <br/>
opinion alright,often forcibly and aggressively. It&#39;s a pain in the <br/>
bum as sometimes we&#39;d like to go shopping,swimming,visiting etc <br/>
without having to explain and justify our entire lifestyle.<br/>
 <br/>
Now that&#39;s just Home Education, unschooling is something else as <br/>
then you also get other Home Educators going on at you about their <br/>
curriculum/workbooks/timetable/child&#39;s academic prowess blah dee <br/>
blah dee blah!<br/>
