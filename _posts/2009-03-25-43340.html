<div id="ygrps-yiv-741468191">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
When I started a post of introduction I didn&#39;t realise that there was<br/>
another one with the same &#39;topic&#39;. Got a bit confusing with the<br/>
responses...<br/>
<br/>
To go over a few responses by people...<br/>
<br/>
From Sandra: &quot; Check with locals for sure to see how it works in<br/>
practical terms. It doesn&#39;t seem you should need to leave her in school<br/>
these five weeks.... If you take her out, what&#39;s the worst that happens?<br/>
They suspend her? They say she needs to repeat a grade? None of that<br/>
will matter if you&#39;re going to homeschool her. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
The problem here is the legalities... which unfortunately are enforced<br/>
here in QLD, Australia. If I keep Amy out of school whilst waiting for<br/>
the paper work to be processed I run a very high risk of being charged<br/>
by the Truancy Board which can then have an effect on the registration<br/>
application.<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand what everyone means by leaving her in school for<br/>
the next 5 weeks can be more harmful and this is something that I want<br/>
to reduce as much as possible. What I have done is contact the high<br/>
school deputy principal and let them know that Amy is now being<br/>
registered for homeschooling. This means her teachers will be informed<br/>
and so will &#39;back-off&#39; from her for a little while. Another thing is in<br/>
approximately 1 1/2 weeks the kids will have their Easter school<br/>
holidays which go for approx 10 days. After that I will be keeping her<br/>
home on the basis that she is being assessd to determine her grade<br/>
levels so that a program can be designed specifically for her needs. As<br/>
the registration process needs to know exactly what she will be taught<br/>
doing this will work in my favour.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I will be ringing the Home Education Unit to ask if I can<br/>
submit the registration in whilst waiting for her birth certificate.<br/>
This will, hopefully, reduce any delays that may occur otherwise and<br/>
also help clarify any thing in the report that I need to submit. If I<br/>
wait until after the birth certifcate arrives it could take longer.<br/>
<br/>
So thank you Sandra and everyone else who helped me get thinking on a<br/>
few things so that this can be done in an effective way.<br/>
<br/>
From Jenny: &quot;Schools can do a lot of damage to kids with &quot;talents&quot;. All<br/>
kids have talents, schools only recognize and encourage some of them.<br/>
Your daughter would be a perfect example. Artists of any kind, in<br/>
schools, are a bit marginalized, even if the schools recognize the<br/>
talent... My oldest daughter, and even me, come to think of it, have<br/>
been accused of living in a fantasy world. Well, why not live in my own<br/>
world? Why not indulge myself in this regard? It doesn&#39;t harm anyone.<br/>
The only harm has come from trying to ignore it, my own self<br/>
exploration, to do what others see best. No good can come from that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand what you are saying here... I am 45 years old and<br/>
over the last couple of years I have been struggling with my own inner<br/>
creativity that had been &#39;subdued&#39; due to others expectations. This<br/>
struggle became so bad that I had a breakdown it was difficult for me to<br/>
live my life whilst living the life that everyone else expected me to<br/>
do.... (When I was around 3 years old I was put onto a rohypnol type<br/>
drug by a child psyholgist as he labelled me as being hyperactive...<br/>
luckily for me my mother didn&#39;t keep me on them.)<br/>
<br/>
This is something that I have seen time and time again especially with<br/>
women over the years... and having to face my own barriers wasa a very<br/>
difficult task but I have come to understand many things because of it.<br/>
Years ago people would ask me what I do and I would always avoid<br/>
answering... but now I answer proudly when I tell people that I am an<br/>
artist and a writer (yes my daughter has &#39;inherited&#39; my talents which<br/>
came from my grandfather). I was once ashamed of saying this becasue I<br/>
was brought up with the old cliche of  &quot;.... such and such will never<br/>
earn you a living.... you&#39;ll be a nobody if you pursue that...&quot; etc...<br/>
<br/>
Yes if we didn&#39;t have those magnificent people who lived in a fantasy<br/>
world we wouldn&#39;t have a world today that is so full of richness and<br/>
beautiful tapestries of imaginations within the stories, movies, art,<br/>
fashion and technology that we see today... we truly owe our living to<br/>
all the people who continued to live in &#39;their worlds.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I have to add here is that I have a partner that I need to<br/>
work around at this stage... he believes that Amy should be caught up<br/>
with her grade and then sent back to school... but I&#39;ve got time to help<br/>
him understand things in a better light... it doesn&#39;t help when he had a<br/>
&#39;strict catholic education&#39;... I won&#39;t go too far into that one...<br/>
<br/>
I have a few friends backing me up. Especially the ones who have known<br/>
Amy for some time and they all agree with me that this would be the best<br/>
move for Amy. I don&#39;t need anyones approval though but it does help.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to my young son, Jake who is 11, when he knew that Amy was<br/>
going to be homeschooled he had a panic attack and said that we was &quot;not<br/>
going to be homeschooled as he wants to stay where he is&quot;. I am going to<br/>
let him stay - for now - but closely monitor how he goes. I will<br/>
however, make the transistion of him being homeschooled once he reaches<br/>
high school if not beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
That being said I would just like to say thank you to everyone who gave<br/>
me some insight to a few things and welcomed me...<br/>
<br/>
Many blessings,<br/>
Tania</div>

.....<br/>
The problem here is the legalities...<br/>
<br/>
So you didn&#39;t check with locals.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for discussing legalities in local areas.  LOCALS are  <br/>
for discussing, and they can help you because they know what the law  <br/>
says AND ALSO what real people are doing in (as I said) practical terms.<br/>
<br/>
It would have taken you less time to check with locals than to explain  <br/>
at length to people in Canada and England and the U.S., India, France  <br/>
and South Africa, why you were opting NOT to check with the locals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=To go over a few responses by people...-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to go over responses on this list.  It&#39;s  <br/>
counterproductive sometimes.   Put out and idea and we can discuss the  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The discussion on arts and limits was great.  We should continue to  <br/>
discuss that but NOT to discuss legalities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not good, though, and you should back down from it immediately:<br/>
<br/>
-=-When it comes to my young son, Jake who is 11, when he knew that  <br/>

let him stay - for now - but closely monitor how he goes. I will<br/>
however, make the transistion of him being homeschooled once he reaches<br/>
high school if not beforehand.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If he likes school and wants to stay there, you will NOT &quot;make the  <br/>
transition of him being homeschooled&quot;--not if the homeschooling you&#39;re  <br/>
thinking of is to be unschooling.   You could pull him out of school  <br/>
against his will, but it wouldn&#39;t be better for him as an individual  <br/>
human who will himself deal with all his issues the rest of his life.   <br/>
You could make the transition to him hating you and wishing he were  <br/>
still in school, and ruining not only your relationship with him but  <br/>
the tone and mood of your entire family.<br/>
<br/>
If you want him to come home, have a fun life with your daughter and  <br/>
make it so appealing that as he grows disenchanted with school (if he  <br/>
does) he might ask to stay home.   Don&#39;t poison the well by villifying  <br/>
what he loves.  It will backfire horribly.<br/>
<br/>
Because you&#39;ve told us that YOU will make the transition regarding  <br/>
your son, I&#39;m wondering if YOU are making the transition regarding  <br/>
your daughter.   Does she want to stay home?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58771668">Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all that you have said and I never intended to bring the<br/>
&#39;legalities&#39; to the point it has now. I was just simply stating how it<br/>
works here where I am. I was not asking for help from outside sources<br/>
but it does help to get a fresh perspective of things. I have checked<br/>
with the local and hence why I am doing things that way that I am for<br/>
Amy.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to Jake the choice will always be up to him... I would never<br/>
do things that would contradict this. As I said I would be closely<br/>
monitoring how he goes - within the public schooling system. If he<br/>
chooses to continue so be it all I can do is monitor and go from there.<br/>
There is no way I would &#39;poison&#39; him into thinking that one way is<br/>
better than the other... as this is simply not the case at all.<br/>
Homeschooling, public schooling, private schooling and boarding school<br/>
all have their pros and cons it is up to the individuals (parents,<br/>
children, carers etc) to find out what works for them. What may be more<br/>
suitable for a child homeschooling may not always benefit a child who is<br/>
in the public sector and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
With Amy she has asked to be homeschooled many times. At the beginning<br/>
of this year she even told people that she didn&#39;t want to go to school<br/>
but stay at home. Due to the problems she has had over the years with<br/>
the public sector I felt it would be of more benefit to homeschool her -<br/>
as I had originally intended 2 years ago - rather than watch her<br/>
continue to have problems which will only compound her growing and<br/>
blossoming into a beautiful person.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise if I had not made myself clearer on this in the earlier<br/>
posting.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Tania<br/>
<br/>
In regards to Amy<br/>
