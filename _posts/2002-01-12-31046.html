<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358522750">I&#39;m still &quot;on leave&quot; with my e-lists....but couldn&#39;t pass up my own<br/>
experience with &quot;prolly&quot;.<br/>
I have been teased for years for saying prolly...though I&#39;m way to much a<br/>
product of schools to ever write it!<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Southwest Ohio,  moved to north KY at age 18.  It was during<br/>
college that I began being &#39;teased&#39; for saying it.  Still say it....don&#39;t<br/>
know where it came from.  I&#39;ll pay attention at our next family gathering to<br/>
see if I hear it.<br/>
