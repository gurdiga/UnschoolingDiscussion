<div id="ygrps-yiv-206786049">Hello to all. I have been reading the list for many months because I <br/>
wanted to see what it is all about before jumping in. I have learned <br/>
so much from all of you as I am always still learning and tempering<br/>
my <br/>
way of living/teaching our children. My name is Elisabeth and I live <br/>
in California. We have been living the hs lifestyle for about 13<br/>
years <br/>
now. We have 5 wonderful ( aren&#39;t they all?!) children who have never <br/>
been to school due to the new things we were introduced to when we <br/>
attended a hs conference when our oldest was only 6 months old, then <br/>
read the Moore&#39;s books over and over again and hung out with <br/>
&quot;experienced &quot; homeschool families at Park days during the toddler/ <br/>
early elementary years.<br/>
Just recently I listened to some tapes that a friend loaned me from a <br/>
conference that the Moore&#39;s gave in the early 90&#39;s. I found this to<br/>
be <br/>
so helpful. Have any of you read their books? Have many of you <br/>
followed their outline of the Moore Formula? What are your <br/>
experiences?<br/>
You&#39;d think that by now I&#39;d have it all figured out but not so as it <br/>
is taking me a long time to unlearn the things that I learned about<br/>
hs <br/>
early on from the Protestant-type hs. Yes, My son and I suffered <br/>
through using Rod and Staff one year- it was awful!!!!! Then we tried <br/>
Sonlight, this was much nicer but too scheduled to really work in our <br/>
life (the books were great!) Well, it has been about four years now <br/>
and we are finally starting to come to a place where we are all <br/>
comfortable and doing what we need to be doing. One of the most <br/>
important things I have seen and learned is this:Negative Peer <br/>
pressure whether it is youthful or in adult frienships is not healthy <br/>
for the development of healthy families/people/little people.<br/>
I look forward to taking part in the list.<br/>
Blessings,Elisabeth</div>
