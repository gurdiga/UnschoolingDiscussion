Missed some of this whole thread but this one caught my eye. For me the<br/>
answer would have to be no. I would be polite to anyone I first met that I<br/>
didn&#39;t know. If I knew for sure that I didn&#39;t like them I would avoid them<br/>
so I wouldn&#39;t have to show I didn&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to be polite. I don&#39;t like BS.<br/>
This country very openly treats people differently just because of status.<br/>
Politicians, actors, musicians, sports stars, even police. That is something<br/>
I don&#39;t like and won&#39;t make it so that my kids see that as normal. They are<br/>
all just people. I get bothered with crime being treated so much differently<br/>
too. Someone gets murdered and it really makes a difference as to who that<br/>
person was. I just don&#39;t see that as right. Of course it really makes a<br/>
difference as to who did the killing too. I see it all the same. Status<br/>
shouldn&#39;t matter when it comes to what&#39;s right and fair.<br/>

<br/>
You very much made sense. This was something I did think about after I logged <br/>
off and finally started to play out all these scenarios in my head. Then this <br/>
morning, my DH said, what is the debate about Rhonda, because you are pretty <br/>
sickenly polite even to people you don&#39;t like in a certain settings? Then I <br/>
sat and had to come up with occasions in which I wasn&#39;t so kind or even <br/>
downright mean and he was right, those were not the same types of occasions, therefore <br/>
the same interactions hadn&#39;t applied. Which then lead him to the times I am <br/>
overtly kind in tone, but hateful with words. Damn, he was right again. I have <br/>
been know to do a caddy one liner with a smile on my face and then walk away, <br/>
leaving those within earshot to wonder if they heard me correctly. Hmmmm, I <br/>
have much to think about today.<br/>

reflection.<br/>

<br/>
Generally, worse.  More extreme on cultural differences.<br/>
You can&#39;t look at your own culture in isolation and make good judgments about <br/>
cultural issues.<br/>
<br/>
I think especially when discussing something that involves relationships <br/>
(root word is &quot;relate,&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; has to do with rank and comparisons), it <br/>
helps to know what the range of possibilites is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just don&#39;t see where I think it&#39;s appropriate to treat anyone more<br/>
<br/>
mannerly or with more respect just on the fact of who they are &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is bizarre to me, honestly.  <br/>
Who they are DOES determine how you feel about them, and how you will <br/>
ultimately treat them.  You might say &quot;hello&quot; the same way, but which one can stay at <br/>
your house for an hour?  Which overnight?  For a week?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;... or much money<br/>
<br/>
they make or what they do for a living.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s way too simplistic.  You&#39;ve never met anyone and been introduced and <br/>
known how much money he made and nothing else about him.  And what they do for <br/>
a living has NO bearing to you on how you will treat them?   Pickpockets, <br/>
senators, nuns, hookers, all the same in your mind?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And so just like my kids don&#39;t see color or religion making a difference as<br/>
<br/>
to how nice they are to someone, then status shouldn&#39;t either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Acknowledging rank or accomplishment in the absence of racial prejudice is <br/>
pretty ideal, I think.  Ignoring ALL of it seems to defeat reason.<br/>
<br/>
On Mother&#39;s Day you&#39;re a mom and you outrank ote table if your family takes <br/>
you out to dinner.  Should people NEVER treat you special, no matter where or <br/>
who you are?<br/>

There IS rank.<br/>

The big news here has been meth labs.  A house two houses from us, behind the <br/>
house straight across the cul-de-sac from us, was cleaned out to bare frame <br/>
in some places when they busted a meth lab there.  Had I gone nuts that day and <br/>
gone over and shot someone, should it matter whether I shot one of the meth <br/>
dealers or a fireman or cop?  <br/>
<br/>
They all had equal rights, but they didn&#39;t all make the same decisions with <br/>
their lives, and so what starts already unequal sometimes becomes more unequal <br/>
as life goes on.  Someone born disadvantaged (financially, mentally, socially) <br/>
can rise above that.  Someone born advantaged (rich, good looking, bright) <br/>
can live in ways that do NOT get them the respect they might have been born <br/>
close to).<br/>
<br/>
You would probably be more angry if a senator went in and killed a Burger <br/>

<br/>
The initial part of the thread was about manners, then rank became a part of <br/>
the topic, where introductions are supposed to be done based on ones rank. I <br/>
however, agree with you in that rank SHOULD have no factor where kindness is <br/>
the treatment we are looking for especially for introductions. Problem is, we <br/>
aren&#39;t all looking for the same thing. Which is also OK. I do, however, fully <br/>
comprehend and understand the protocol, I just choose not to buy into it. When I <br/>
attended school, &quot;charm&quot; was a required class in the eighth grade in order to <br/>
graduate. Maybe that&#39;s where my disdain stems from. <br/>

How do you all handle Thank You cards? <br/>
I remember my dad always forcing us to write them, and we thought it was silly. Now as an adult, I can see how thoughtless it is for someone (say a bride) to overlook any money and time spent in chosing a gift by not responding with a card. In cases of gifts sent long-distance, a card let&#39;s the sender know that the gift was received. How do we teach our kids to show appreciation for gifts without forcing Thank You cards?<br/>

  I have a question along these lines...<br/>
  How do you all handle Thank You cards? <br/>
  I remember my dad always forcing us to write them, and we thought it was silly. Now as an adult, I can see how thoughtless it is for someone (say a bride) to overlook any money and time spent in chosing a gift by not responding with a card. In cases of gifts sent long-distance, a card let&#39;s the sender know that the gift was received. How do we teach our kids to show appreciation for gifts without forcing Thank You cards?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well from the A+ earner in charm, I absolutley, positively hate Thank You <br/>
cards. Hate getting them, hate receiving them. They seem fake and impersonal. I&#39;d <br/>
rather get a phone call. Or even just a thank you in person the next occasion <br/>
we see each other at. The only time Thank You cards have not bothered me, is <br/>
when someone has moved away and lives so far or on a different clock and <br/>
therefore we won&#39;t see each other perhaps for a very long time, nor will we <br/>
necessarily talk on the phone due to time differences. <br/>
<br/>
So in answer to your question, I don&#39;t teach my kids to send notes of <br/>
gratitude. Rather I have demonstrated acts of gratitude and made available to them,  <br/>
cards for all occasions to be used at their will, when they find something <br/>
worthy of sending any type of card.<br/>

The exceptions are when I *choose* to partake of it (like the Martial Arts class or the SCA (hopefully getting involved in that at some point).  But in mainstream day to day life, I really don&#39;t personally run into it that much, or maybe I just don&#39;t recognize it.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for validating that I am still at least coherent. But the <br/>
option is not about ignoring reality, but changing it rather. So for me it <br/>
would seem a bigger disservice to tell them they have no power to change reality. <br/>
Reality is, the US of A requires compulsory education, varying from state to <br/>
state over age, however, all of us are bucking that reality by unschooling.  So <br/>
what is more important, accepting reality as unchangable or accepting reality <br/>
and learning to stand tall if we want it to change?<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who also questions reality, but that is an entirely different topic <br/>
and far too exhausting ROFLMAO<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just don&#39;t see where I think it&#39;s appropriate to treat anyone more<br/>
mannerly or with more respect just on the fact of who they are &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is bizarre to me, honestly.<br/>
Who they are DOES determine how you feel about them, and how you will<br/>
ultimately treat them.  You might say &quot;hello&quot; the same way, but which one<br/>
can stay at<br/>
your house for an hour?  Which overnight?  For a week?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not really who they are but how they are. How they act, if they are nice and<br/>
respectful and I enjoy them. And who they are has nothing to do with how<br/>
long they can stay here. It goes back to how they act. My MIL wouldn&#39;t &quot;out<br/>
rank&quot; a friend I&#39;ve only know for a few months just because she is my MIL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s way too simplistic.  You&#39;ve never met anyone and been introduced<br/>
and<br/>
 known how much money he made and nothing else about him.  And what they do<br/>
for<br/>
a living has NO bearing to you on how you will treat them?   Pickpockets,<br/>
senators, nuns, hookers, all the same in your mind?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the first was a question, then yes I have met people who I know are<br/>
wealthy and nothing else about them. Makes no difference to my in how I feel<br/>
about them when I meet them. And what they do for a living doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
bearing on how I treat them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never met a pickpocket so I can&#39;t say. I have met politicians and nuns<br/>
and hookers. I have spoken to them and treated them all the same when we<br/>
met. Of course after spending some time with them, I might change my<br/>
behavior as in relaxing a bit more or changing my language, but I would get<br/>
that cue from them personally, not having anything to do with what they do<br/>
or did for a living. There are hookers I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable swearing<br/>
around and politicians I would.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;On Mother&#39;s Day you&#39;re a mom and you outrank ote table if your family<br/>
takes<br/>
you out to dinner.  Should people NEVER treat you special, no matter where<br/>
or<br/>
who you are?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People should want to treat me special because of who I am as a person, not<br/>
because I&#39;m a mom or the bride at a wedding.<br/>

  I guess the whole &quot;rank&quot; issue was a source of toxic relationships in my life, so I&#39;ve done the best I can to eliminate it because of the power struggles that seem to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
  The exceptions are when I *choose* to partake of it (like the Martial Arts class or the SCA (hopefully getting involved in that at some point).  But in mainstream day to day life, I really don&#39;t personally run into it that much, or maybe I just don&#39;t recognize it.<br/>

    &lt;&lt; I think Mary agrees that rank exists.  The argument is about whether its <br/>
    right. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    How can that happen though?<br/>
<br/>
    How can there be ANY group of mammals, let alone humans with language, <br/>
    traditions, religion, and all that, in which there is no heirarchy?<br/>
<br/>
    People operate within heirarchies bigtime.<br/>
    That&#39;s why mixed age groups of kids help the little ones learn much better <br/>
    than same-age school classes of all the same-age kids.  Kids will create their <br/>
    own heirarchy within every third grade classroom on earth BECAUSE human <br/>
    interaction inherently involves rank.<br/>

It has absolutely no bearing on how I treat people.  They are all people, with human dignity.  We all start somewhere and people can and do change.  <br/>

<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I just don&#39;t see where I think it&#39;s appropriate to treat anyone more<br/>
  mannerly or with more respect just on the fact of who they are &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;This is bizarre to me, honestly.<br/>
  Who they are DOES determine how you feel about them, and how you will<br/>
  ultimately treat them.  You might say &quot;hello&quot; the same way, but which one<br/>
  can stay at<br/>
  your house for an hour?  Which overnight?  For a week?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Not really who they are but how they are. How they act, if they are nice and<br/>
  respectful and I enjoy them. And who they are has nothing to do with how<br/>
  long they can stay here. It goes back to how they act. My MIL wouldn&#39;t &quot;out<br/>
  rank&quot; a friend I&#39;ve only know for a few months just because she is my MIL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;That&#39;s way too simplistic.  You&#39;ve never met anyone and been introduced<br/>
  and<br/>
  known how much money he made and nothing else about him.  And what they do<br/>
  for<br/>
  a living has NO bearing to you on how you will treat them?   Pickpockets,<br/>
  senators, nuns, hookers, all the same in your mind?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  If the first was a question, then yes I have met people who I know are<br/>
  wealthy and nothing else about them. Makes no difference to my in how I feel<br/>
  about them when I meet them. And what they do for a living doesn&#39;t have a<br/>
  bearing on how I treat them.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never met a pickpocket so I can&#39;t say. I have met politicians and nuns<br/>
  and hookers. I have spoken to them and treated them all the same when we<br/>
  met. Of course after spending some time with them, I might change my<br/>
  behavior as in relaxing a bit more or changing my language, but I would get<br/>
  that cue from them personally, not having anything to do with what they do<br/>
  or did for a living. There are hookers I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable swearing<br/>
  around and politicians I would.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;On Mother&#39;s Day you&#39;re a mom and you outrank ote table if your family<br/>
  takes<br/>
  you out to dinner.  Should people NEVER treat you special, no matter where<br/>
  or<br/>
  who you are?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  People should want to treat me special because of who I am as a person, not<br/>
  because I&#39;m a mom or the bride at a wedding.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kill a bunch of hookers or druggies and the police just don&#39;t work as hard<br/>
on it from what I see. And I&#39;m being general here.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So your point is making my point.<br/>
People Do have differing and relative social value.<br/>
There IS rank.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course there is rank. I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t mean much to me and that it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t based on what someone does or doesn&#39;t do and how wealthy they are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The big news here has been meth labs.  A house two houses from us, behind<br/>
the<br/>
house straight across the cul-de-sac from us, was cleaned out to bare frame<br/>
in some places when they busted a meth lab there.  Had I gone nuts that day<br/>
and<br/>
gone over and shot someone, should it matter whether I shot one of the meth<br/>
dealers or a fireman or cop? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not to me, you still killed someone. Took someone&#39;s life. Someone&#39;s kid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You would probably be more angry if a senator went in and killed a Burger<br/>
King employee than if a drug dealer did.  Why?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually it wouldn&#39;t. Why would it??<br/>

Well said.  In fact, my daughter didn&#39;t make me breakfast in bed on Mother&#39;s Day.  It was a totally different day altogether.  But she was treating me special because I was mom, and I was taking them out for the day and they appreciated it.<br/>
<br/>
That means far more than doing it because it happens to be Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;The initial part of the thread was about manners, then rank became a part<br/>
of<br/>
the topic, where introductions are supposed to be done based on ones rank. I<br/>
however, agree with you in that rank SHOULD have no factor where kindness is<br/>
the treatment we are looking for especially for introductions. Problem is,<br/>
we<br/>
aren&#39;t all looking for the same thing. Which is also OK. I do, however,<br/>
fully<br/>
comprehend and understand the protocol, I just choose not to buy into it.<br/>
When I<br/>
attended school, &quot;charm&quot; was a required class in the eighth grade in order<br/>
to<br/>
graduate. Maybe that&#39;s where my disdain stems from.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From what I can see then I guess I&#39;m with you. I do understand and get it. I<br/>
do know it exists. I just don&#39;t like it and don&#39;t live that way for myself<br/>
and have no problem with my kids doing the same if they chose to.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have a question along these lines...<br/>
How do you all handle Thank You cards?<br/>
I remember my dad always forcing us to write them, and we thought it was<br/>
silly. Now as an adult, I can see how thoughtless it is for someone (say a<br/>
bride) to overlook any money and time spent in chosing a gift by not<br/>
responding with a card. In cases of gifts sent long-distance, a card let&#39;s<br/>
the sender know that the gift was received. How do we teach our kids to show<br/>
appreciation for gifts without forcing Thank You cards?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I send thank you&#39;s for gifts. Always have. My mom always did and I guess I<br/>
got it from her. But not for everything. If its&#39; my birthday or my<br/>
children&#39;s birthday and someone comes with a gift (same with Christmas) I<br/>
will verballythank them for the gift and for spending time with us. If it<br/>
seems over the top with what they did as far as the gift, I will also send a<br/>
note later. If it&#39;s a wedding, anniversary graduation thing that doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen every year, I will send a thank you. If anyone sends anything that<br/>
wasn&#39;t there to present it, I send a thank you. I&#39;ve followed this way of<br/>
doing it with my kids too. So they see me do it. When they got older I would<br/>
let them know what I was doing on behalf of them. Sometimes even asking if<br/>
they wanted to sign it. When Tara got older I would get the card and ask her<br/>
if she wanted to write something in it or just sign it. Now she sends her<br/>
own when the circumstances come up. I guess again by modeling.<br/>
