I spent the day today in the kitchen. I ended up with 16 meals and more to<br/>
do later. I did make 3 excellent smelling (and tasting) fish dishes, 2 pork<br/>
steak, 2 chicken, 2 ribs, 2 beef stir fry, steaks in marinade, 2 chili,<br/>
stuffed cabbage, and a boiled dinner. I still have to do the hams, pork<br/>
roasts, and more burger for meatloaves. I have picky eaters (dd#2 lives on<br/>
peanut butter and apple butter sandwiches with yogurt as a side) so my meals<br/>
are not extravagant. BTW dd#2 is underweight and tiny. She will be five in<br/>
July and can still wear most 2 and 3 T outfits. Below are some of the<br/>
recipes...<br/>
<br/>
Marinated Fish<br/>
<br/>
2 lbs fish (I used pollock)<br/>
1 cup lemon juice<br/>
1/4 cup olive oil (I used one batch olive, one canola)<br/>
1 tsp. parsley flakes<br/>
2 tsp. oregano (or Italian seasonings)<br/>
1 clove garlic - thinly sliced or minced.<br/>
<br/>
Mix all ingredients (except fish) in measuring cup (less dirty dishes).<br/>
Lightly grease foil or pan. Place fish in foil and cover with sauce. Cover.<br/>
Place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.<br/>
Put covered fish in oven and cook for 40 minutes or until done (fish will<br/>
literally flake apart) When cooled place in Ziplok (labeled) and FREEZE!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marinated Steaks<br/>
<br/>
Steaks  (I bought a big round steak and cut it into 5 sections)<br/>
2 tsp. Oregano<br/>
1 cup canola oil<br/>
1 cup apple juice<br/>
2 tsp. minced onion<br/>
1/2 tsp. powdered garlic (I am Italian, so I actually use more, but you can<br/>
use however much you prefer)<br/>
<br/>
Mix all ingredients (except steaks) in Ziplok baggie. Lay steaks in baggie<br/>
and FREEZE. When labeling, write &quot;Pan fry until done&quot;. When you take it out<br/>
of the freezer, the steaks will marinate in the defrosting period. Then just<br/>
pan fry until finished... :)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you would like more recipes. I made an excellent smelling<br/>
boiled dinner (hate the name, though) I think that it can also be called<br/>
corned beef and cabbage. Smells great all through the house!<br/>
<br/>
Stay warm and full!!! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70550118">Yes thanks Stephanie please keep sending those recipes so far I got as far<br/>
as prefrying 3 lb. of chicken breasts cutting them up into cubes and froze<br/>
them in two separate bags. I have no idea what to do with them however! do I<br/>
defrost them in microwave and add noodles and a fettucine alfredo sauce or<br/>
what? I am still waiting for the book Frozen Assets it was not in any of the<br/>
book stores near me so I e-ordered it will take a week or so.  I like the<br/>
idea of freezing everything in ziplock baggies that you just pop in the<br/>
microwave. I am exhausted just reading your menu from yesterday! I am not<br/>
sure I have the stamina but am willing to give it a try!Your dd reminds me<br/>
of my Melissa but she hates peanut butter and jelly and is more like a<br/>
vegetarian like her Dad. For a few years the only thing she would eat is<br/>
tuna fish from Trader Joe&#39;s which is a few hundred miles from our house. I<br/>
finally found an as good if not better brand online which works for her. I<br/>
also go to a coupon club online you pay a nominal fee for up to $50 worth of<br/>
coupons of your choice. The website info is below if you do take advantage<br/>
please mention my DH&#39;s name! Thanks for the inspiration! And possibly the<br/>
chance to save more money by doing this in advance. I am a bit confused by<br/>
all the recipes which tell you  can freeze the food raw versus cooking it up<br/>
in advance and then defrosting it. Is there a big difference in taste?<br/>
