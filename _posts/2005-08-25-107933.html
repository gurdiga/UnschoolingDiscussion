<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357905244">I think I need an attitidue adjustment or something. <br/>
I don&#39;t know.  I wanted to continue with the plan of<br/>
unschooling my 5 yr old dd.  However, as a single mom<br/>
going to school myself and trying to make everything<br/>
work financially, I&#39;ve been feeling much pressure to<br/>
just put her into the ps this fall for Kindergarten. <br/>
It&#39;s really difficult when people who are in the same<br/>
situation and even vastly better situations<br/>
financailly are sending their kids off to school after<br/>
having homeschooled/unschooled for several years. <br/>
But, that&#39;s beside the point.  Here, I&#39;m looking at<br/>
our individual circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I work part-time from home less than 20 hrs a week<br/>
currently.  I also am going to be in grad school 2<br/>
nights a week.  The fact that school for me is in the<br/>
evenings leads me to feel that sending her off to<br/>
school is not going to really make much of a<br/>
diffference and that if I can find a good support<br/>
system  (which I already am doing), then I&#39;ll still<br/>
have the needed time to study and continue to<br/>
unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my question:  I&#39;ve signed up for a charter<br/>
school that &quot;says&quot; they support unschooling, but when<br/>
I spoke with the ES (Education Specialist) last night,<br/>
it&#39;s clear she really has no clue what unschooling<br/>
really means and certainly does not support it, she<br/>
fears it in fact.  Thing is, in my financial situation<br/>
$600/yr would be A LOT to buy some books, or craft<br/>
type stuff or let her take ballet or gymnastics or<br/>
iceskating (things dd has asked for).  <br/>
<br/>
But, after talking to the ES, it seems that quite a<br/>
percentage would have to be used for &quot;curriculum&quot;-type<br/>
stuff.  And that probably reatlistically leaves about<br/>
$400 or less for the year for our own discretion. <br/>
It&#39;s not like i&#39;d use the curriculum anyhow, but would<br/>
just buy it to appease the ES and leave it on the<br/>
bookshelf.  <br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m going to whine....I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>
write down everything we did on every school day in<br/>
&quot;educationalese&quot;.....I quite enjoy leaving the idea of<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot; in the far back of my consciousness where<br/>
it belongs.  But, there are 6 subjects and they<br/>
require me to write what we did every day for those 6<br/>
subjects and to hand in a sample once every 20<br/>
&quot;school&quot; days from each subject.  I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m<br/>
just whining, but it seems like such a huge<br/>
interruption of my time and real unschooling to have<br/>
to do this stuff.   The state does not require it and<br/>
I am personally not worried at all about it.  DD is a<br/>
very curious child and has picked up WAY more than<br/>
most K aged kids that have been in preschool and K<br/>
their whole lives.  I have not sat down and taught her<br/>
anything, but she loves to write constantly and she&#39;s<br/>
pretty good at basic math too, just from being<br/>
curious.  And she knows a lot about the world and<br/>
nature....it&#39;s incredible how unschooling (or living<br/>
life!)  has been working.  We are very active most<br/>
days and yet she has days to just veg at home if she<br/>
wants interspersed in there.  The playdates have<br/>
picked up quite a bit recently though and she&#39;s been<br/>
enjoying them, as have I.<br/>
<br/>
The money is appealing....it would give us a chance to<br/>
DO a bit more.  I&#39;m just worried that it is too big a<br/>
price to pay.  I don&#39;t know if I should just suck it<br/>
up and jump through a few/several hoops.  I&#39;m<br/>
concerned though that it will have an effect on how we<br/>
currently unschool...bring too much &quot;have to&quot;s in for<br/>
dd.  Am I just worried for no reason here....can<br/>
anyone tell me it&#39;s really not that bad and that it<br/>
can be done with ease while still keeping unschooling intact?<br/>

with fewer hassles?<br/>
<br/>
Are there relatives who might be willing to help with the costs of <br/>
skating and ballet and what-all as &quot;birthday gifts&quot; or &quot;Holiday <br/>
gifts&quot; - gifts that keep on giving &lt;wink&gt;? My dad annually renews <br/>
DS&#39; subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any barter-type arrangements you can make for the lessons <br/>
she wants? For example, I know of folks who have traded stall <br/>
mucking out (ick) for horseback riding lessons. If you can find a <br/>
few other homeschoolers interested, perhaps you could arrange a <br/>
class - and get a discounted rate for your DD as a &#39;reward&#39; for <br/>
bringing in additional patrons to the dance school.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is: is the money involved worth the trade off in terms <br/>
of time and piece of mind?<br/>

<br/>
Lots of homeschooling support groups in California. Try www.nhen.org or<br/>
email me privately with your locality (in case we are neighbors - I have<br/>
some useful inexpensive resources).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And now I&#39;m going to whine....I don&#39;t want to have to<br/>
write down everything we did on every school day in<br/>

subjects and to hand in a sample once every 20<br/>
&quot;school&quot; days from each subject. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about living in California is that there is no<br/>
requirement from the State to do *any* of this stuff - as you said - the<br/>
state does not require any form of assessments or testing if you use one of<br/>
the private school options. Therefore this assessing and assigning and<br/>
requiring really is coming entirely from the Charter School. Maybe you can<br/>
ask for another ES or negotiate something different.<br/>
<br/>
Most people who do Charter want the &quot;help&quot; and guidance. The idea of having<br/>
some money to buy any educational material they want sounds like freedom in<br/>
comparison to the strictures and book lists and required stationary lists of<br/>
regular schools. I agree that you have to ask yourself whether the money is<br/>
worth the unpleasant obligations. It is not for me. Just the ideas that<br/>
there is some teacher judging Jayn and some files placed somewhere<br/>
containing these evaluations, are so abhorrent to me that I chose to home<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Just in passing I don&#39;t even consider the idea of &quot;subjects&quot; as belonging<br/>
even deep in my consciousness, but rather actively purge it with the<br/>
opposing concept of connections and gestalt learning. <br/>
<br/>
None of the Unschoolers I know IRL locally are in Charters, so I have no<br/>
recommendations of other Charter schools that might be more genuinely US<br/>
friendly. However that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist. You might try asking<br/>
on the HSC e-list ( www.hsc.org )<br/>
<br/>
Only you can decide if you genuinely have the time and energy to combine<br/>
Unschooling with both work and your studies. Sometimes it takes difficult<br/>
prioritizing. It may be that you have to cut back on some classes and take<br/>
just a little longer to complete your degree. OTOH it may be that you will<br/>
find some other parents in similar situations to trade off playdates/study<br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m<br/>
just whining, but it seems like such a huge<br/>
interruption of my time and real unschooling to have<br/>
to do this stuff.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is an interruption and you do have better things to do with your time. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in CA, too, and I think I know the charter you&#39;re talking about. I have<br/>
friends in it. So, some of what I&#39;m going to write will be specific to that<br/>
charter.<br/>
<br/>
First off, the money that is apparently now $600 a year was originally, I<br/>
think, $1200-$1500 a year. It has been gradually reduced over the last few<br/>
years. The items you buy with the money have to be, by the school&#39;s jargon,<br/>
consumed -- like classes or paper & crayons -- or they must be returned. So,<br/>
the people who were prompted to join by the idea of $1200 in school supplies<br/>
now have to go through the same hassle of record-keeping and meetings with<br/>
the ES for half the money. I could see it getting even lower. The ESes, BTW,<br/>
get paid more than $1,000 a student for their every-20-days meetings and<br/>
paperwork. You can&#39;t buy from any vendor that has any religious materials in<br/>
their catalog. You can&#39;t buy anything that remotely resembles clothing -- no<br/>
costumes or those nice silky squares that you&#39;ll see in Waldorfy catalogs.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschool charters I&#39;m familiar with in CA all require standardized<br/>
testing. A lot of the parents realized that they actually didn&#39;t legally<br/>
have to test, but since it&#39;s a charter school, the school was able to say,<br/>
&quot;No, you&#39;re not legally required to test in public school, but we can say<br/>
that if you want to be in our special public school you have to test.&quot; I<br/>
don&#39;t know all the details. It was apparently painful for the school<br/>
administration to make this pronouncement, because it was started by people<br/>
with a strong unschooling or at least relaxed homeschooling bent, but<br/>
there&#39;s a certain percentage of students who are required to test or the<br/>
school&#39;s existence/funding is as risk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not in any charter because I consider my time and freedom for my kids as<br/>
much more valuable than the money, which at this point is truly a pittance<br/>
compared to the hassle. I don&#39;t want someone in my house -- or to have to<br/>
make arrangements to meet somewhere else every three weeks. I don&#39;t want<br/>
someone quizzing my kids. I don&#39;t want to sit down and analyze what we do<br/>
every day. I don&#39;t want to give someone else, someone whom I would be<br/>
expected to please, so much power in my life. The ESes vary in quality as<br/>
well. Some are very focused on bureaucracy -- one ES threatened a friend of<br/>
mine with reporting her children as truant when they had a miscommunication<br/>
about an appointment.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also nowhere near wealthy, although we undoubtedly have fewer<br/>
financial pressures than many. We live in LA, where renting a house that is<br/>
appropriate for a family with four children costs nearly 50 percent of my<br/>
husband&#39;s income (some of that is because we&#39;re new to the area -- people<br/>
who have been here for years previously have lower rents or mortgage<br/>
payments -- and some is because journalists don&#39;t get paid all that much).<br/>
We shopped around for six months to find this place. I spend most of my work<br/>
time (I work from home) on a project for a nonprofit that is an extension of<br/>
my volunteer work and doesn&#39;t pay market rate.<br/>
<br/>
So we seriously watch our pennies, but I really don&#39;t feel like the kids are<br/>
missing out. My 7yo is doing a lot of ice skating (she did gymnastics during<br/>
the school year), and my son plays organized baseball year-round. In LA,<br/>
there is always a super-expensive way to do things, and it&#39;s easy to feel<br/>
deprived if that&#39;s all you know about. But there are always less-expensive<br/>
options, too. I&#39;ve chosen to take the time I would be spending going through<br/>
charter school hassles to bargain hunt!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could say my main point about enrolling in a charter more<br/>
succinctly: I&#39;ve watched my friends in the charters jump through more and<br/>
more hoops for less and less money.<br/>

$12,000 a year gross, and you live in a tiny 1-bedroom<br/>
apartment that costs over $1000/mo to rent if I were<br/>
not subsidized, well yeah...a few hundred dollars<br/>
sounds like a dream.  Of course, if I don&#39;t go with<br/>
the charter, I&#39;ll find a way to work a few more hours<br/>
or something, but then, that&#39;s even more time away<br/>
from dd.  I guess a could use the rationale that she&#39;s<br/>
only 5 and doesn&#39;t neeed classes, but she wants to<br/>
play violin or dance and those are super expensive<br/>
things. <br/>

Anyhow, the ES said I have the choice what to pick out<br/>
from an approved vendor list and it is quite<br/>
comprehensive.  The list includes curriculum, sure,<br/>
but also available are many different types of<br/>
classes, etc.  And Borderes books is an approved<br/>
vendor - of course, we could just use the library.  <br/>
Hmmmm...now I wonder if the fact that Border&#39;s books<br/>
is a vendor means that I&#39;d get to pick whatever she<br/>

&gt;  I think you might be actually very disappointed<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; how it all really works if you enrolled her.<br/>

 Most people who do Charter want the &quot;help&quot; and<br/>
guidance. The idea of <br/>
having<br/>
some money to buy any educational material they want<br/>
sounds like <br/>
freedom in<br/>
comparison to the strictures and book lists and<br/>
required stationary <br/>
lists of<br/>
regular schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t really want any help or guidance, it was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just some way to find more resources for dd, that&#39;s<br/>
all.   <br/>
And yes, it certainly does seem like a lot more<br/>
freedom than sending her to public school, which I&#39;ve<br/>
unfortunately had to consider due to our situation.  <br/>

there is some teacher judging Jayn and some files<br/>

home<br/>
school.<br/>

But, I&#39;m sure, living in LA, there are plently of<br/>
offerings to be found.  And if you know of any either,<br/>
please let me know.  Do you go to any of the park days<br/>
they have around here for homeschoolers?  <br/>

freedom and for your daughter to have her unschooling compromised (potentially, <br/>
if you end up pressing her to &quot;do subjects&quot; she might not have heard of <br/>
otherwise).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196381516">Hi Brenda,<br/>
Once you figure out whether you can use the money for the things Rachael<br/>
wants you can decide whether or not it&#39;s worth your time.  Also, it might be<br/>
worth asking other parents in your charter.  Sometimes the ES doesn&#39;t know<br/>
everything about the policies of the charter.  The ES may be willing to meet<br/>
you somewhere without Rachael present if that is helpful.  As for testing,<br/>
My charter (one county over from you) doesn&#39;t require testing for K-3.  They<br/>
do for the older grades.  But that gives you 4 years to dicker before having<br/>
to make that difficult decision. <br/>
My last recommendation is to find out who the best es is for unschoolers and<br/>
try to get a transfer to her.  Oh, and for keeping records, mine aren&#39;t as<br/>
much as you describe but one thing I do is email her the paperwork so when<br/>
we meet it&#39;s just happy talk about fun things we did that month.<br/>
<br/>
I know many people who say it&#39;s not worth the trouble.  But the trouble may<br/>
be worth it to you at this time when your finances are so tight.  The idea<br/>
to find bargains and trades etc is a good one  no matter which way you go.<br/>
You can always drop it after a month or a day if you don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
==================================================<br/>
<br/>
I am afraid of that, but some money to get dd things<br/>
that she wants to do, I&#39;m willing to do a certain<br/>
amount of paperwork and stuff.   I know some states<br/>
require recordkeeping of the same sort, even from<br/>
unschoolers.  So, even though I&#39;m not living in those<br/>
states, perhaps I should just deal with the paperwork<br/>
in order to get her the resources she wants.  <br/>
Also, I figure 15 minutes a day of me writing<br/>
everything down is not much for a few hundred dollars<br/>
a year.  But, then I might be wrong. ... <br/>
<br/>
  When you are trying to live in LA and make under<br/>
$12,000 a year gross, and you live in a tiny 1-bedroom<br/>
apartment that costs over $1000/mo to rent if I were<br/>
not subsidized, well yeah...a few hundred dollars<br/>
sounds like a dream.  Of course, if I don&#39;t go with<br/>
the charter, I&#39;ll find a way to work a few more hours<br/>
or something, but then, that&#39;s even more time away<br/>
from dd.  I guess a could use the rationale that she&#39;s<br/>
only 5 and doesn&#39;t need classes, but she wants to<br/>
play violin or dance and those are super expensive<br/>
things. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220020160">Don&#39;t underestimate how WONDERFUL it is to be independent - not have  <br/>
anybody to report to about your family&#39;s private life. To willingly  <br/>
give that up is something to take pretty seriously - there are lots  <br/>
of people in other states who would just LOVE to be able to be as  <br/>
independent as we can be, here in CA.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t underestimate the &quot;hidden lessons&quot; that kids learn from  <br/>
our actions and decisions. For those who are &quot;rigging&quot; the paperwork,  <br/>
making it look like you&#39;re doing some kind of teaching/curriculum/ <br/>
lessons, etc., when, in fact, you&#39;re unschooling, you might want to  <br/>
really think about what your kids are picking up from that. If you&#39;re  <br/>
in a state where you have no choice, then they&#39;re learning that there  <br/>
are ways to get around oppressive bureaucratic policies. If you&#39;re  <br/>
doing it to get government money, they&#39;re learning something else -  <br/>
and I&#39;m just saying that it bothered me enough to give it up after a  <br/>
month or two. I felt that the negative lesson I was teaching my kids  <br/>
was not at all worth the things we were able to buy. So - that&#39;s me.  <br/>
Your mileage may vary and I&#39;m just saying it is something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to be independent, but is very low on funds, it is  <br/>
still truly possible to unschool and provide a wonderful rich  <br/>
environment. As it happens, my kids got free violin lessons on  <br/>
borrowed violins - I traded the violin teacher for me doing math  <br/>
activities with her kids. And my kids got ballet AND tap dance  <br/>
classes at a local church which didn&#39;t charge and even had several  <br/>
boxes full of slightly used dance shoes that we could borrow, free of  <br/>
charge. We went to ALL the library programs, the city recreation  <br/>
department offered scholarships, the local YMCA offered scholarships,  <br/>
and there were free concerts in the park during the summer. Our  <br/>
homeschooling group put on its OWN theatrical events - plays directed  <br/>
and performed by the kids (with a lot of parental help).<br/>
<br/>
These &quot;homegrown&quot; experiences were truly FAR more in-depth and more  <br/>
fun and more valuable in so many ways than the ones we&#39;d have had to  <br/>
pay a lot of money for. And, again, look at the underlying message  <br/>
the kids receive, loud and clear, when they see mom being careful  <br/>
with money, making choices, comparing costs and benefits, and so on.  <br/>
The kids get involved in these decisions and become very good  <br/>
consumers and really come to understand how to make choices. It is  <br/>
awesome.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We took vintage dance by distributing flyers for an entire season.<br/>
I&#39;ve traded writing services for math tutoring and have art lessons.<br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to add that sometimes the richest part of life has been<br/>
when we&#39;ve been broke and played soccer every day in the backyard, not<br/>
on a rec team. We did that one spring and I tell you, it is still a<br/>
favorite memory for us.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter spent months working on ballet with a book from the<br/>
library without any lessons at all. My son taught himself guitar and<br/>
continued to learn piano on his own without lessons after he quit when<br/>
we couldn&#39;t afford it any more.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; and performed by the kids (with a lot of parental help).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did things like this too (in California). We had weekly picnics and<br/>
made all kinds of parties with friends. We had a gold rush, a pony<br/>
express, a midnight tea, a japanese meal, a medieval feast... all<br/>
while we were broke. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I have found that as we&#39;ve gotten more money, we tend to think<br/>
that &quot;classes out there&quot; are somehow better. The truth is that we<br/>
began running around so much, I&#39;ve cut out a lot of our activities due<br/>
to the harried life it started to make for us.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in CA, we were at the beginning of the charter school<br/>
era. What I noticed was the creeping way that the school had<br/>
&quot;requirements.&quot; I hear about them now all the time as a business owner<br/>
who offers services that the charter schools want to pay for. Kids are<br/>
expected to &quot;produce&quot; X number of essays in a year or they haven&#39;t<br/>
&quot;moved up&quot; to the next grade level.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve discovered that many of us (businesses) won&#39;t work with<br/>
charter schools because they are notoriously bad at paying on time or<br/>
at all. I won&#39;t let them pay for online classes at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 And, again, look at the underlying message  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the kids receive, loud and clear, when they see mom being careful  <br/>

&gt; awesome.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree! So true.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to be creative when you lack funds and feel stressed. I<br/>
remember feeling so stretched! But I am also impressed with my life<br/>
during that era. It was rich in many, many ways I wouldn&#39;t trade now. <br/>
<br/>
I am also so proud of my kids. One of them paid his own way to space<br/>
camp and started a business to be able to do it. Another asked family<br/>
for birthday money just to go to Shakespeare camp. These are the ways<br/>
we&#39;ve made it with five kids and limited funds.<br/>
