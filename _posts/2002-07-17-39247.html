&lt;&lt; I also have a 13 year old who is a non-writer SO FAR. He just hasn&#39;t felt <br/>
a <br/>
real need yet to get his thoughts on paper. He can perform the mechanics of <br/>
writing, but has no real need to write quickly, neatly or with any meaning. <br/>
I&#39;m confident that he will though. He has always been on his own schedule of <br/>
learning and this will be no exception. When he needs it, he will learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Mary!!<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were cleaning the living room (going through those corners <br/>
in which things were neatly piled for future excavation), and I found a set <br/>
of cartridge pens with calligraphy nibs that someone gave me for Christmas.  <br/>
Yes, yikes, been there since Christmas.   <br/>
<br/>
So I showed Holly how they worked, played with them a bit, and have wished <br/>
for several days that I had something to write!  I keep thinking &quot;I should <br/>
write a letter,&quot; but the people I actually need to write to have e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I could do the grocery list in my finest cursive, but my husband might rather <br/>
I&#39;d just print it with arrows and notes about what size and all... (he does <br/>
the Costco shopping).<br/>
<br/>
I could address envelopes, but we have nothing at the moment to send out.<br/>
<br/>
I could write in a journal or diary, but that&#39;s all on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
Post cards.  I could send some post cards to my friends overseas, but every <br/>
one has e-mail, and I could sent attached photo-files.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am, fully &quot;schooled,&quot; no writing biases or fears, someone who <br/>
writes every single day, and I can&#39;t dig up a reason to use my handwriting <br/>
with my *new* pens.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you or your children write poetry or have a favorite poem?  Nicely <br/>
penned poems on good paper make great gifts. If you have an artist in <br/>
the family they can illuminate them, too.  When I was in high school <br/>
and had the time and inclination to compose, I would write poetry and <br/>
my best friend would illuminate it, we gave them to our family as <br/>
christmas gifts one year. My parents still have it hanging on the <br/>
wall.<br/>

I doodled a little and showed Holly how they worked and why cursive works <br/>
well with fountain/cartridge pens because of the way the nib is made, and <br/>
then there was nothing important to doodle, but other things actually were <br/>
waiting to be done, they just didn&#39;t need a pen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m nearly 49 and have written miles and miles for fun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I did Bilbo&#39;s Bath Song for my brother in law a l-o-n-g time ago, and he <br/>
still has it in his bathroom!!<br/>
