<div id="ygrps-yiv-763966601"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Lately, I have to &quot;remind&quot; her to practice, and of her commitment,<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s becoming a real pain!  I&#39;ve told her that it is her choice<br/>
&gt; to continue with the instrument or not, but if she&#39;s going to<br/>
&gt; continue, practice is part of the package deal.  I&#39;m paying for<br/>
&gt; weekly lessons, it doesn&#39;t make sense to do that if she&#39;s not willing<br/>
&gt; to put in the practice time.  I think she&#39;s just bored with it right<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; I had considered stopping paying for lessons<br/>
&gt; until she gets interested again, but she&#39;ll lose so much if she lets<br/>
&gt; it slide for a year or more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you see this as less of a all or nothing situation?  What if you don&#39;t<br/>
bug her about practicing?  What if she doesn&#39;t practice for a couple of<br/>
weeks?  What if she goes unprepared to her lessons for a month?  I can tell<br/>
you from the teacher&#39;s perspective that she wouldn&#39;t be the first student<br/>
I&#39;ve had come unprepared, and likely not the last.<br/>
<br/>
Is it likely that your daughter is going to let is slide for a year or more,<br/>
or would she merely like a break?  Does she like the music she&#39;s playing, or<br/>
would she like to try something totally different -- jazz, fiddle, rock,<br/>
etc?  Is there a problem with the teacher that she hasn&#39;t mentioned yet?<br/>
<br/>
I try hard to let my son&#39;s piano practice just happen, although if I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard the piano in a few days I might mention missing hearing him play.<br/>
Sometimes that gets him going, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t particularly<br/>
care either way, since it&#39;s far more important to me that his childhood<br/>
memories aren&#39;t filled with a nagging Mommy but with music as fun.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if she wants to play flute, perhaps she could borrow one from a<br/>
friend to try out, or save up her allowance to help buy a used one.  Again,<br/>
it&#39;s not all or nothing; lots of kids play two instruments!<br/>
