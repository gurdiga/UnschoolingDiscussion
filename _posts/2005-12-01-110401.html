<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025421220">For those who play Neopets and might not know this, or might have forgotten:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s December 1.   Today and every day in December you can go to the Advent <br/>
Calendar (go to &quot;explore&quot; and click on &quot;terror mountain&quot; which opens Happy <br/>
Valley.   Yeah.   It&#39;s on the right--open it and click the button below the <br/>
calendar) and get free stuff.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They will give you so much stuff you&#39;ll have to learn to use your safety <br/>
deposit box if you haven&#39;t already.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Christmas Labels place in Happy Valley where you can print out <br/>
Christmas tags, if your kids like this Neopets art.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been playing Sutek&#39;s tomb and the pirate spelling game, because I <br/>
can play them without thinking much and still watch movies on the side.     <br/>
If you have a younger kid who doesn&#39;t type really fast and if you are a fast <br/>
typist, come by halfway through a Sutek&#39;s Tomb game and type in <br/>
plzsutekcanihavemoretime<br/>
<br/>
plz sutek can i have more time   but all as one word<br/>
and it will put another 30 seconds on the timer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to type, especially with the &quot;plz&quot; thing.   <br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re totally stuck on sutek&#39;s tomb, type<br/>
pyramibread<br/>
and it will show you a move.<br/>
<br/>
I would consider this &quot;off topic&quot; except that as computer games go and as <br/>
kids learning how programs work and how html sites work, it&#39;s really rich with <br/>
opportunity, in addition to the plain facts of their playing all the logic and <br/>
pattern and speed games, and messing with the bank and the interest there, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And two more tricks, one Marty taught me and one I figured out myself.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s:   Never buy medicine for a sick pet.   Just go to the Fairy Springs <br/>
a time or two a day and click there, and pretty soon they&#39;ll be healed.   <br/>
<br/>
Mine:   Feeding your pet for fun is fine, but don&#39;t pay good money for food <br/>
just because they show &quot;hungry&quot; or &quot;starving.&quot;   It&#39;s much cheaper to put them <br/>
on vacation at the Neolodge and pay five NP a day for food.   You can get a <br/>
cheap or midpriced hotel and add burger bar and restaurant.   They&#39;ll be full <br/>
for days after.<br/>

before!  I was once upon a time one of those parents that NEVER <br/>
allowed computer games for many ridiculous reasons.  I actually <br/>
learned about Neopets off something I read that you wrote <br/>
somewhere.  My kids are so grateful to you for this cause they love <br/>
Neopets and so does mom.&lt;G&gt;***<br/>

I know better now, good heads up though.***<br/>

I just went into my safety deposit box and forgot that I have a <br/>
Christmas paint brush in there.  Hmmm do I dare paint my pet or do I <br/>
sell it???  I never quite no what to do!  <br/>

Have fun collecting stuff!<br/>

<br/>
If you click on an item, one of the options is to put it in your deposit box.<br/>
<br/>
If, though, from the &quot;my items&quot; page you click on &quot;quick stock&quot; up above the <br/>
items, it brings up a list of your items and you can click under &quot;deposit&quot; for <br/>
any you want to store away, and at the same time you can donate stuff or <br/>
dispose of it. If you have a shop, &quot;stock&quot; means to put the item in the shop&#39;s <br/>
inventory.<br/>

If, though, from the &quot;my items&quot; page you click on &quot;quick stock&quot; up above the <br/>

world would probably not be open from the site until 2006.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know how accurate that info is, but I also went to the help button and <br/>
put in Jelly and it said that Jelly world didn&#39;t exist or something <br/>
like that.  Anyway I am sorry if I confused ya&#39;ll when I posted <br/>

  2- you can win them on some of the game &quot;timbola &#39; fruit Machine ...<br/>
  3. sometimes you can get them from doing a fairy quest<br/>

I suggest you go to the library and get the book &quot;Why Can&#39;t My Child<br/>
Behave?&quot; by Jane Hersey.  (Horrible title, I know, I know...)  It is<br/>
the updated version of Dr. Feingold&#39;s 1970&#39;s book &quot;Why Your Child is<br/>
Hyperactive&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people follow the program without buying the materials.  In<br/>
fact, the materials weren&#39;t even available until about 15 years ago. <br/>

The program is good in that it makes things easier, provides you with<br/>
a ready-made shopping list so you don&#39;t have to read every label and<br/>
do the research yourself, and gives you access to the member-only<br/>
sections of their website.  but it certainly isn&#39;t necessary, and<br/>
people have been doing Feingold for generations before the program<br/>
materials were ever available.<br/>

with this.  I am JUST starting to look into this and I know absolutely<br/>
nothing about additives, chemicals, hormones, blah blah.  So I don&#39;t even<br/>
know where to begin.  I thank you very much for offering for me to email you<br/>

I suggest you go to the library and get the book &quot;Why Can&#39;t My Child<br/>
Behave?&quot; by Jane Hersey.  (Horrible title, I know, I know...)  It is<br/>
the updated version of Dr. Feingold&#39;s 1970&#39;s book &quot;Why Your Child is<br/>
Hyperactive&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67308656">I am finally back online!!  We are moved into our new house!  YAY!!!<br/>
BUT..........<br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t gotten ANY shopping done for Christmas!!  Conner&#39;s 1st BD is<br/>
tomorrow, Christmas is 2 weeks away, and I have gotten NO shopping done!!  I<br/>
feel like a huge loser!!  Wanna know something else?  I don&#39;t even know what<br/>
to get my kids for Christmas!  None of them have made any kind of long list<br/>
of things they want, and I have NO IDEAS!!!  Help me please!!<br/>
 <br/>
Brandon is 9<br/>
Justin is 7 (and I think I am going to get him some kind of robot thing for<br/>
one of his gifts, I just don&#39;t know what yet)<br/>
Tyler is 5<br/>
Conner is 1<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t believe that they don&#39;t have a huge list for santa!  They really<br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;into&quot; anything specific either.  I am hoping to find some ideas of<br/>
what to do for them.  I mean anything that they like, they already have all<br/>
the stuff to go with it, so I want to get them something new.  I mean,<br/>
Brandon likes Pokemon, but has the movies, books, all the cards, etc.<br/>
Justin is a nintendo freak, but has just about every game he could ever<br/>
want.  Tyler basically just plays whatever everyone else is playing.  He has<br/>
no interests of his own that he is sharing or wanting things for.  Conner,<br/>
well, he is going to be a year old tomorrow, so he should be pretty easy.  I<br/>
also need ideas for stocking stuffers as well as gifts.  What is a mom to<br/>
do?<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and one more thing.....I don&#39;t know what to get my husband either!!  We<br/>
always get each other gifts.  I need a gift (or few) for him and some<br/>
stocking stuffer ideas for him as well!<br/>
 <br/>
I have NEVER felt so lost this time of year.  I have always known what to<br/>
get my kids and my husband.  This really stinks!!  Hope you guys can help<br/>
out!<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s try substituting a positive thought -- there will probably be big <br/>
sales on the 23rd and 24th.  If you wait &#39;til then to shop you can find <br/>
great prices.  Pat yourself on the back and pretend you planned it that <br/>
way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You might try asking each kid what they think the others would like to <br/>
have.  Put some fresh brains to work on the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I was really stumped for my father-in-law this morning.  He&#39;s not very <br/>
active and watches a lot of TV so I was looking for a DVD that was <br/>
newish.  I just went to Amazon and surfed through their recommendations <br/>
and their categories. Priming the pump really helps.<br/>
<br/>
For my mother-in-law I had NO ideas so I just panicked and bought her a <br/>
flowery robe.  (And a box of tea and a romance novel to go with it.)  I <br/>
don&#39;t have to be brilliant every year!<br/>
