&quot;I completely agree with this.  We used to live in the Washington, D.C. area, <br/>
with accordingly high-stress jobs and lots of time spent commuting.  We made <br/>
a conscious decision to sell our house and move to Vermont, specifically right <br/>
on Lake Champlain, to be closer to nature and give our daughter and any other <br/>
children in our lives (and US) a more simple, back-to-nature, joyful life. I <br/>
work from home now, and my husband works retail (that&#39;s what&#39;s available here <br/>
locally) -- our income dropped to 25% of what we had earned previously. &quot;<br/>

Amy- we live near Albany, NY but are seriously considering moving up to the <br/>
Adirondack/Plattsburgh area (we have family there) for many of the same <br/>
reasons.  We are worried about the logistics of jobs/retirement savings, etc.  The <br/>
growing season is so short there too that I wonder how much of a garden we can <br/>
produce?<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how your family is doing with the changes.<br/>
