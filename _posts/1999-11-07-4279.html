<div id="ygrps-yiv-431474412">I used to live in Knoxville and went through the same situation with the <br/>
umbrella school.  We HAD to use a church school for it.  We found one that <br/>
did not require us to sign a statement agreeing with them on religious issues <br/>
but this still really bothered me.  I felt that it was a violation of the <br/>
separation of church and state for Tennessee to only allow the umbrella <br/>
schools to be church schools.  I wish someone would take them to court on it. <br/>
 I made phone calls about it to various groups but didn&#39;t get anywhere at the <br/>
time.<br/>
