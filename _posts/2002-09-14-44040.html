<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995104767">Hi Maria! My name is Virginia and I live in SC and I am trying to get my son Christopher (about to eight and in the second grade) out of the public school system. I just finished eight hours of paperwork and I am still not done. They put you through these hoops so you will be afraid and back down. I know. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two years ago, when my son was in kindergarden, I tried to homeschool. The school got DSS involved because they thought my son had ADHD. His TEAHER had &quot;diagnosed&quot; him. Out of fear, I backed down. My ex and I had just separated and I was scared they would take Chris away from me. So I kept him in school and let them put him on Concerta. His problems have worsened instead of improving.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Although Chris manages to pass all his subjects, he is supposedly disruptive to the other students. I look forward to having him at home. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; him since he was born. Chris could write and read when he entered kindergarden. He knew his colors, shapes, numbers and such in pre-kindergarden. Children just have to learn the way they learn and the school system is not set up for that. They are set up as a diploma factory. I feel for you because I am there too. But I am proud of you for having the courage to do what you know is best.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The school system bullies parents into abdicating the right to the joys and wonders of teaching their own children. Their fear makes them do this. Our society has the cock-eyed notion that, if everyone does not conform to a set standard, that all of civilization will fall into anarchy. After two years of the &quot;joys&quot; of the public school system, I think I am ready for a little anarchy&lt;ggg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, I will stop rambling now. Take care.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>
<br/>
                Virginia<br/>

<br/>
Yes, the &quot;Teacher&#39;s&quot; do the diagnosing, one of the things I plan to <br/>
do in the future is lobby for law changes regarding &quot;Teacher <br/>
Diagnosis&#39;s&quot; but that&#39;s in the future.  Can only take one day at a <br/>
time, but once I get my own children helped and back on track, then I <br/>
will help fight for others.  I haven&#39;t spoken much on the rest that <br/>
has happened to us since Mirial has been in public schools.  How <br/>
DFACS tricked me into signing her up for crossroads then tried to <br/>
file neglect charges when I realized what sort of school itwas, and <br/>
went and snatched the signed papers out of thier hands and tore them <br/>
up (They had told me the school had special teachers that had <br/>
patience to deal with special childre, not that the teachers don&#39;t <br/>
have to do anythign but babysit zombies all day, and yes the children <br/>
were so druugged up tha most of them ooked like zombies)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I feel for you because I am there too. But I am proud of you for <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is so wonderful realizing other parents are going through this <br/>
same thing with this ADHD crap.  It makes me feel like I&#39;m not <br/>
alone.  My best friend, her daughter is the same age a Mirial, and <br/>
was also diagnosed with ADHD at the same time Mirial was.  She took <br/>
the ritalin route, and now the poor child stays in hospitals <br/>
form &quot;Halucinations&quot; than out, and all the doctors do is increase <br/>
those drugs :(  On the days I feel like giving up, it&#39;s my daughters <br/>
smile that keeps me going.  Looking at her and KNOWING if I give in, <br/>
it could ruin her for life.  It has been so terribly hard the past <br/>
years.  But that&#39;s the job of parenting, to sacrifice EVERYTHING to <br/>
ensure your children are well taken care of, and happy.  On the days <br/>
I want to give up, I just gho somewhere, have a good cry, tal to God, <br/>
and he sends me peace that i can&#39;t explain.  It&#39;;s that peace that <br/>
has kept me going, knowing that God knows, he cares and He <br/>
understands.  <br/>

They use theri self appointed power to try and run people&#39;s live&#39;s, <br/>
when their energies shouldn&#39;t be on parent&#39;s that refuse to drug <br/>
thier children, but on those that actually do abuse and harm children.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, don&#39;t mean to ramble myself, but you sound like you&#39;ve been in <br/>
the same shoes as me almost, and it&#39;s so nice to know that there are <br/>
others out there that do understand.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever need someone to talk to, I&#39;m just a phone call away.  <br/>
Drop me an email and I&#39;ll give you a call on my dime.<br/>

When I read posts about how energetic your younger (?) daughter is, I<br/>
think what a blessing it will be in later life to have that much pep. <br/>
I&#39;m a tired, middle-aged woman, and I think being strong and full of<br/>
energy is a great advantage to have in life.  <br/>
<br/>
Sitting quietly may be rewarded in school, but it doesn&#39;t take you far<br/>
outside of school.<br/>

Lenore Hayes has written a book called Homeschooling the Child with ADD<br/>
or Other Special Needs. I don&#39;t think you need to read it, but I really<br/>
wish your friend would.  :(<br/>

So... now the families will be forced to take their kids to a doctor at their <br/>
own expense?<br/>
Or a doctor will make &quot;school calls&quot; and diagnose kids there?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine it will be lots of improvement for kids and families.<br/>
<br/>
I hope so, though.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe schools should have to pay for the visits and diagnoses.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I see it, is that any teacher that wants to diagnos a child <br/>
as ADD or ADHD should first submit it to the board, THEN if the board <br/>
says yay, then the parent should get a proper medical diagnosis from <br/>
a doctor of the PARENTS choosing, (Not the boards or school systems) <br/>
and that the school system should foot the bill for the diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe then all these huffy teacher&#39;s that scream ADHD won&#39;t even get <br/>
past the board, because the board isn&#39;t going to want to pay the <br/>
bills.  Any CONCERNED parent that suspects a child is ill, is going <br/>
to naturally go to the docotr without the schools recommending it <br/>
ANYWAY so the teacher&#39;s really need to butt out and let parent&#39;s do <br/>
thier jobs as parents.</div>
