<div id="ygrps-yiv-521809879">&lt;&lt; I don’t have time to go looking up a law for you. I saw it on the news at<br/>

something different, and interesting:)<br/>

Eligibility <br/>
<br/>
Active duty, retired, honorably discharged veterans and their family members, <br/>
U.S. civilian marine personnel of Military Sealift Command, other U.S. <br/>
citizens who are determined eligible by the Chief of Naval Operations because <br/>
of notable service and/or other contributions to our government. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s eligibility for a military burial at sea.  The ceremony and formations <br/>
are all shown on one of those pages.  It&#39;s like having a military burial, <br/>
national cemetary, flag, however-many-gun salute.  Those never military <br/>
aren&#39;t eligible.<br/>
<br/>
Cremated remains into the sea is a whole different deal, and easily done by <br/>
charter boat or airplane it seems, from things I just read.<br/>
<br/>
Here was a cremation/burial at sea page:<br/>
<br/>
Three Easy Steps to Sea Burial<br/>
1. Call Sea Services Toll Free Answer Line at 1-888-551-1277 if you wish to <br/>
discuss your planning with an experienced counselor.  Information about <br/>
charter services or biodegradable OceanUrn™ options are best answered with a <br/>
telephone call.<br/>
 <br/>
2.  Complete the &quot;Authorization for Burial At Sea&quot;  form, which you can print <br/>
from this site by clicking on the link above, or you can have mailed to you.  <br/>
 <br/>
3. Insert the authorization form and your check or money order to &quot;Sea <br/>
Services&quot; for $195 in the outer cremated remains shipping container.  <br/>
(California burials are less expensive due to less restrictive laws -- call <br/>
us.)  Your telephone counselor can accept credit card payment or discuss any <br/>
other requests you may have.  <br/>

From a Canadian &quot;funeral chapel&quot;&#39;s page:<br/>
<br/>
Question: Can you bury the deceased at sea? <br/>
Answer: Federal government law must be adhered to with respect to a burial at <br/>
sea. Strict regulation and guidelines now make a burial at sea virtually <br/>
prohibitive. A permit application must be made well in advance of need (at <br/>
least 8 weeks). A notice of intent must be published in a local newspaper. <br/>
Proof of the notice must be sent to Environment Canada and include an <br/>
application fee. Other stringent regulations include nautical miles from land <br/>
for burial site and casket specifications. It is recommended that alternative <br/>
arrangements be made since burial at sea regulations and costs have become <br/>
very restrictive, and almost impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend who works as a funeral director says the funeral homes don&#39;t tell <br/>
people their real options.  Last time I talked to him  he was getting more <br/>
and more involved in alternatives and home-burials and such, which for  years <br/>
professionals have told people weren&#39;t legal, and they were lying to make <br/>
money (says Kevin Williams who&#39;s done this work for over 20 years).  Rather <br/>
than telling people their actual rights, they would scare them away from any <br/>
but the traditional expensive stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an article on JFK Jr. at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/memorial990721.html,">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/memorial990721.html,</a> and there is <br/>
this sidebar.<br/>
<br/>
Qualifications for At-Sea Burial  <br/>
According to the U.S.Navy, there there are six eligibility requirements for <br/>
burial at sea:<br/>
<br/>
1. Person was a member of the uniformed services.<br/>
2. Person was a retired member of the uniformed services.<br/>
3. Person was a former member, discharged under honorable circumstances.<br/>
4. Person was part of military sealift command or civilian marine personnel.<br/>
5. Person was a dependent of a member of the armed forces, or former member.<br/>
6. Other U.S. citizens who are deemed eligible by the chief of naval <br/>
operations for at-sea commitment due to notable service or outstanding <br/>
contributions to the United States. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So it didn&#39;t say it&#39;s illegal, per se.  It&#39;s just that &quot;burial at sea&quot; is a <br/>
specific military ceremony, and so subject to military rules.<br/>
<br/>
BUT WAIT--from another article... <br/>

<br/>
-=-Sen. Kennedy had requested the burial at sea, saying it was his nephew&#39;s <br/>
wish to be cremated and his ashes spread on the waves. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Permission granted for burial at sea<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Kennedy family requested permission for burial at sea from a Navy <br/>
ship; the request was approved by Defense Secretary William Cohen. ...<br/>
Also, protocol allows sea burials of the children of decorated Navy veterans. <br/>
The late President John F. Kennedy was a naval officer wounded and cited for <br/>
heroism in World War II. <br/>
<br/>
He was cremated.  So were the others on the plane with him.  So this was NOT <br/>
the &#39;burial at sea&quot; in which a body in a weighted bag is slid off the edge.  <br/>
So this doesn&#39;t even apply.  Traditional &quot;burial at sea&quot; (letting a body off <br/>
because the sailor died while out on the ocean) was NEVER going to involve <br/>
cremation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886583718">&quot;Burial at Sea is governed by a myriad of state and federal laws. Penalties<br/>
for violating these laws are oppressive. Nothing can be placed in the ocean<br/>
without proper reporting to the U.S. Government.&quot;  Sea Services, Inc.<br/>
<br/>
There are Coast Guard regulations that must be met.  The military has their<br/>
own rules and regs for military personnel.  Each state that borders an ocean<br/>
has their own laws.  Each state has regulations regarding scattering of<br/>
ashes regardless of where.  The EPA has regulations regarding scattering of<br/>
ashes regardless of where.  The clean air and water acts also get into the<br/>
game.  Other countries have their own laws.<br/>
<br/>
The specifics on the JRK, Jr. burial at sea and the special permit had to do<br/>
with the use of the ship because he was not military.<br/>
