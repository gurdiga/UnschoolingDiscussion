<div id="ygrps-yiv-942553556">i&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a list anywhere--besides in the archives of <br/>
this list--of the new lists that were created out of this one last <br/>
month.  maybe a place/page in groups.yahoo.com somewhere, for which i <br/>
could share a link or url with my local support groups and lists?  <br/>
anyone know where/how to hook up with a list like that?  have i used <br/>
the word list in this post about lists enough times? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.<br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=Home+education+magazine)">http://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=Home+education+magazine)</a> -- I think<br/>
she just searched for &quot;home education magazine&quot; at yahoo and then sent the<br/>
url to that page  -- worked pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Though there&#39;s at least one missing (Unschooling-Days). If all the list<br/>
descriptions had &quot;Home Education Magazine (HEM)&quot; in them (maybe some just<br/>
say HEM?), they should all turn up. (And if that exact phrase is used with<br/>
the (HEM) in it, it should eliminate the HELM lists.) Then the list would be<br/>
assured of being current whereas a webpage might not, considering the<br/>
penchant some people have for creating lists ;-)<br/>
