---------------------------------------<br/>
Two women meet in the park and start to chat:<br/>
<br/>
W1:    Hi.  I&#39;m Maggie.  My kids are the three in red shirts, helps me keep<br/>
track of them.<br/>
W2:    (Smiles)  I&#39;m Terri.  Mine are in the pink and yellow shirts.  Do you<br/>
come here a lot?<br/>
Maggie:    Usually two or three times a week, after we go to the library.<br/>
Terri:    Wow.  Where do you find the time?<br/>
M:    We home school, so we do it during the day most of the time.<br/>
T:    Some of my neighbours home school, but I send my kids to school.<br/>
M:    How do you do it?<br/>
T:    It&#39;s not easy, I go to all the PTA meetings and work with the kids<br/>
every day after school and stay real involved.<br/>
M:    But what about socialisation?  Aren&#39;t you worried about them being<br/>
cooped up all day with kids their own ages, never getting the opportunity<br/>
for natural relationships?<br/>
T:    Well, yes.  But I&#39;ve worked hard to balance that.  They have some<br/>
friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit their grandparents almost every<br/>
month.<br/>
M:    Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom.  But don&#39;t you worry about<br/>
all the opportunities they&#39;re missing out on?  I mean, they&#39;re so isolated<br/>
from real life - how will they know what the world is like - what people do<br/>
for a living - how to get along with all different kinds of people?<br/>
T:    Oh, we discussed that at PTA, and we started a fund to bring real<br/>
people into the classrooms.  Last month, we had a policeman and a doctor<br/>
come in to talk to every class, and next month, we&#39;re having a woman from<br/>
Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>
M:    Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store the other week, and<br/>
he got talking about his childhood in Tokyo.  My kids were absolutely<br/>
fascinated.  We invited him to dinner and got to meet his wife and their<br/>
three children.<br/>
T:    That&#39;s nice.  Hmm.  Maybe we should plan some Japanese food for the<br/>
lunchroom on Multicultural Day.<br/>
M:    Maybe your Japanese guest could eat witht eh children.<br/>
T:    Oh, no.  She&#39;s on a very tight schedule.  She has two other schools to<br/>
visit that day.  It&#39;s a system-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>
M:    To tell you the truth, I never had time to think about it.  before I<br/>
even saw him, my six-year-old had asked him what he was going to do with all<br/>
the oranges he was buying.<br/>
T:    Your child talks to strangers?<br/>
M:    I was right there with him.  Ho knows that as long as he&#39;s with me, he<br/>
can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>
T:    But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him.  My children never talk<br/>
to strangers.<br/>
M:    Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>
T:    They&#39;re never with me, except at home after school.  So you see why<br/>
it&#39;s so important for them to understand that talking to strangers is a big<br/>
no-no.<br/>
M:    Yes, I do.  But if they were with you, they could get to meet<br/>
interesting people and still be safe.  They&#39;d get a taste of the real world,<br/>
in real settings.  They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to tell when a<br/>
situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>
T:    They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades in their health<br/>
courses.<br/>
M:    Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom.  Let me give you my<br/>
number - if you ever want to talk, give me a call.  It was good to meet you.</div>
