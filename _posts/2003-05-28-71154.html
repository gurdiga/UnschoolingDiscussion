&gt; mean, but for her first *experience* with liking a boy, this is a really <br/>

&gt; And you know, Haleigh is extremely mature, so it helps t have that <br/>
&gt; perspective.  I agree with you completely.<br/>

first time that really &quot;liking a girl&quot; has clicked in for this kid, too.  Julian <br/>
hasn&#39;t had any major crushes yet, but in his youth group at church he has at <br/>
least a couple of girls in the 12 year old range who have major crushes on him. <br/>
Julian is oblivious. I only know this because my partner is one of the Youth <br/>
Group Advisors, and it is VERY obvious.<br/>
