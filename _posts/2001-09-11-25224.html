<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359518207">The kidlets used the label maker part of one of the software programs we<br/>
have to make up &quot;labels&quot; for them and their friends.  Middle kidlet&#39;s read<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m A Hoot&quot; and youngest&#39;s read &quot;Just Label Me ME&quot;  One of their friends<br/>
had a &quot;Here&#39;s My Label&quot; with a blank space under it in quotes (can you guess<br/>
who has played that goofy CD &quot;Here&#39;s Your Sign&quot; until he wore it out &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
They all had a ball and then they made up signs saying &quot;We Hate Labels&quot; and<br/>
they marched up and down in front of the house.  There they were with their<br/>
signs and these sticky labels all over them &lt;g&gt;  They finished their day<br/>
with a &quot;camp out&quot; in the backyard and they burned their labels in the fire<br/>
they roasted their marshmellows over.  You should have seen all the cars<br/>
that honked and gave them a thumbs up.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Probably would be a good idea if I explained what started all this &lt;g&gt;<br/>
There was a program on tv about labeling kids in school as learning disabled<br/>
or ADHD, etc.  And we had a big long discussion about how harmful &quot;labels&quot;<br/>
can be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751243403">Lynda- LOL I love it!! Not to long ago we took my son into psychiatric <br/>
emergency as he, 7 years old, had bashed out his bedroom windows, was beating <br/>
on me, all around dangerous and destructive. I took the advice of some <br/>
therapists that my son had seen at the time and brought him in. After about <br/>
10 minutes with my son the psychiatrist wanted to label my son as ADHD, put <br/>
him in a mental facility for 3 days and start him on ritilin. Well, at first <br/>
we considered it, but after a minute I said H### no and we got out of there <br/>
as fast as we could. I greatly regret even considering this. Well, I did some <br/>
research on ADHD after that and ya know, I really don&#39;t believe most of what <br/>
I read. I can tell you, my son is NOT ADHD. He does have some emotional <br/>
problems steming from when he was abused several years ago by a daycare <br/>
provider. Long story, there&#39;s alot to this. Needless to say, my son does go <br/>
speak to a therapist still. He enjoys talkign to her and asks to go see her <br/>
often. He&#39;s never NOT wanted to go, but if he did I&#39;d listen to his feelings. <br/>
<br/>
After my sons abuse I had placed him in public school for the kindergarten <br/>
year. In that one year I can&#39;t even list the number of labels I heard them <br/>
want to place on my son. Some of them were quite interesting though, they <br/>
said he was ADHD yet Gifted. Hmmm, could he just have been BORED? &lt;shakes her <br/>

sucker flew right out into cyberspace!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, have you also tried diet changes.  We were told that eldest and<br/>
second son were hyperactive (that was what they called it back in the dark<br/>
ages &lt;g&gt;).  Eldest son had something blessed if I remember the name of it<br/>
but it is sort of acquired or forced dyslexia and when we took care of that<br/>
the hyper actions discontinued.  Second son had food allergies.  Watch out<br/>
world if he had a red apple, a peanut butter sandwich and orange drink!  We<br/>
are talking pinball machine activities.  Zip, zing, watch out walls!<br/>
<br/>
He also reacted to chemical additives to foods.  Aspertame, msg, any<br/>
preservatives.  Various reactions besides the hyper zingy behavior.  He was<br/>
also easily bored.<br/>

After about 10 minutes with my son the psychiatrist wanted to label my son as ADHD, put him in a mental facility for 3 days and start him on ritilin.

ritalin for my taste.<br/>
<br/>
They talked about ADD and other psyciatric disorders sometimes being combined.<br/>
<br/>
They showed a very chubby kid who was treated abusively by several other<br/>
kids and was (of course) depressed.  (They were theorizing that he had<br/>
ADD as well and that everything would be better if they dosed the ADD.) <br/>
As they were working through different doses of medicine to &quot;fix&quot; him, I<br/>
was wishing forsomeone to invent an anti-cruelty pill for the other<br/>
kids.  Hell, it would be a step in the right direction to admit that the<br/>
other kids are sick.<br/>

P.S. (Disclaimer to people who have kids on ritalin:  I DO believe ADD<br/>
EXISTS, in a small fraction of the population.  Disclaimer to people who<br/>
hate ritalin:  But I don&#39;t think wiggling is proof of a brain disorder.)</div>

&gt; &gt; Not to long ago we took my son into psychiatric<br/>
&gt; &gt; emergency as he, 7 years old, had bashed out his bedroom windows, was<br/>
beating on me, all around dangerous and destructive. I took the advice of<br/>
some therapists that my son had seen at the time and brought him in. After<br/>
about 10 minutes with my son the psychiatrist wanted to label my son as<br/>
ADHD, put him in a mental facility for 3 days and start him on ritilin.<br/>
Well, at first we considered it, but after a minute I said H### no and we<br/>
got out of there as fast as we could.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I saw a show on ADD on PBS last night that was much too positive about<br/>
&gt; ritalin for my taste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They talked about ADD and other psyciatric disorders sometimes being<br/>
combined.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They showed a very chubby kid who was treated abusively by several other<br/>
&gt; kids and was (of course) depressed.  (They were theorizing that he had<br/>
&gt; ADD as well and that everything would be better if they dosed the ADD.)<br/>
&gt; As they were working through different doses of medicine to &quot;fix&quot; him, I<br/>
&gt; was wishing forsomeone to invent an anti-cruelty pill for the other<br/>
&gt; kids.  Hell, it would be a step in the right direction to admit that the<br/>
&gt; other kids are sick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Betsy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. (Disclaimer to people who have kids on ritalin:  I DO believe ADD<br/>
&gt; EXISTS, in a small fraction of the population.  Disclaimer to people who<br/>
&gt; hate ritalin:  But I don&#39;t think wiggling is proof of a brain disorder.)<br/>

did to him was she encouraged my son&#39;s classmate to horribly tease and <br/>
