&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First.. you are not doing anything wrong.  Nothing in life ever goes<br/>
smoothly for too awfully long, there is no *just getting it right and then<br/>
everything will always be fine forevermore*. That&#39;s an illusion and we need<br/>
to stop spending our time trying to grab hold of it.<br/>
<br/>
You are in the midst of growth, that&#39;s all.  You have children around you<br/>
growing and changing every day.  If you are lucky, you are growing and<br/>
changing every day.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every parent on this list is nodding their head.  Some are smiling that<br/>
irritating smile of rememberence, some are grinning from ear to ear because<br/>
misery loves company, others are smiling so they don&#39;t cry and they are<br/>
hoping you get some good advice. Today I fall in the misery loves company<br/>
group.  Almost every Saturday I get up early and head out for time alone,<br/>
but last weekend we had two different family things to go to and my time<br/>
alone didn&#39;t happen.  It&#39;s bleak around here today.<br/>
<br/>
Mothers must remember to take care of themselves first.  You need to get<br/>
your time alone somehow.  You didn&#39;t say how old the other children are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve only recently begun to experiment with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling...maybe that&#39;s part of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes,it&#39;s part of the problem. You feel disoriented and not sure of what to<br/>
do next.  Let&#39;s brainstorm ways you can establish a routine that both<br/>
nourishes you and the children&#39;s need to explore and grow.<br/>

Oh, you&#39;re probably not doing anything wrong!  You are, however, tired!!  You <br/>
have kids (how many?) and a new baby.  You are taking care of the house and <br/>
meals and errands, etc., and trying to be a good unschooling influence.<br/>
<br/>
You are tired!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a break is in order.  How could you arrange it?  Husbands can take the <br/>
kids off sometimes.  Neighbors could have them for a visit.  Relatives to <br/>
lend a hand?  Just enough so you and the baby are alone and can just sit and <br/>
breath.  Wouldn&#39;t that be nice.  Just to sit quietly!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if some things don&#39;t get done that&#39;s OK too.  Dust won&#39;t kill you!  And <br/>
kids can surive on less-than-gourmet meals for a looooong time.<br/>
<br/>
How can you give yourself a break??<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I have to go now.  My daughter just walked up and screamed that she <br/>
hates me.  You see, I wasn&#39;t too sympathetic when she got hurt (yet again) <br/>
from wrestling with her brother (yet again).  She gets bumped and wants <br/>
sympathy and yet she&#39;s the one who starts it up with him or jumps on top of <br/>
him or some such silliness and I just remind her that this is the Xth time <br/>
this has happened (today).  Brother does the same sort of thing.  Go as fast <br/>
as you can on your bike and then get all ticked off when you fall and get <br/>
hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
One day they were playing a game to see what would happen if they ran really <br/>
fast and crashed into each other.  This was in the front yard and so the <br/>
neighbor girl joined in.  The only comfort was that it wasn&#39;t only my <br/>
children who were so incredibly . . . whatever -- and these are bright kids.  <br/>
I think.  :):)<br/>
<br/>
Well, good luck to you in getting some rest.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039541837">I&#39;ve just filed it under Spring Fever.  Seems everyone&#39;s kids are this way<br/>
right now.  Maybe because of the weird long crummy winter, who know&#39;s but<br/>
it seems worse this year than the usual fidgets.<br/>
