As you might expect, I&#39;m not a fan of Waldorf schooling, or of any brand of<br/>
schooling that is based on assumptions about what children &quot;should&quot; or<br/>
&quot;should not&quot; be learning or doing at a particular age. Some children are<br/>
strongly motivate to read at 4 or 5, others not until much later. Children,<br/>
including little ones, get lot of value from computers. The computer is the<br/>
main tool of our culture today and children can benefit from exploring it<br/>
early. I recently heard a mother of a former Waldorf family speak about her<br/>
son&#39;s experience. He begged for a computer and they wouldn&#39;t give him one.<br/>
Then he had a terrible bicycle accident and was in the hospital for months.<br/>
Because he couldn&#39;t do much else, they bought him a computer. His reaction:<br/>
&quot;It was worth having that bicycle accident to finally get a computer!&quot;<br/>
Needless to say, the family left Waldorf after that.<br/>

Those comments are a jumbled mess, but because I commented there and subscribed, I get new comments by e-mail, so I&#39;m sharing this one.<br/>

It&#39;s not about learning to read.  It&#39;s about parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490472269"><div dir="ltr">When I was exploring homeschooling in general and educational theories there were a few automatic &quot;no go&#39;s&quot; for me because I am not a person who follows dogma, not as a philosophical statement, but because I am just not temperamentally suited to dogmatic thinking.  I couldn&#39;t see how you could apply dogmatic beliefs to parenting.  <div>
<br></div><div>Children are individuals who will be as they are and need what they need, want what they want.  As a parent, I always felt that I should try to respond to my child&#39;s ACTUAL needs and wants, not what some theorist wrote my that child SHOULD need and want.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>As an example: My son only ever wanted about 3 or 4 M&amp;M&#39;s at a time, my daughter liked to have a small bag or container with many more than that.  So, I had a large bag for the M&amp;M&#39;s and a small container for my daughter.  My son would come back for 3/4 at a time and I would help my daughter fill her container (until she got big enough to do so herself) as she wanted.  </div>
<div>Thinking about it, experts would just say that they shouldn&#39;t get candy!! Oh well, this is how we did things with any small finger food, including fruits and veggies.  </div><div>chris</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-490472269gmail_extra">
