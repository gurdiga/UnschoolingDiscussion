<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983913596">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how NY State members handle the IHIP and quarterly report requirements.  I so far would say I&#39;ve been and eclectic homeschooler/almost unschooler and would like ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Liza I bet you have a lot of great ideas and info about this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m still asking around how unschoolers handle this. The <br/>
tide has changed and the majority of homeschoolers in NYCHEA are <br/>
schoolers (the group was founded by unschoolers).<br/>
<br/>
So I am still researching this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625550695">Hi Liza,<br/>
<br/>
The reporting issue is one of the reasons I haven&#39;t fully let go and moved completely into unschooling.  Right now I ask my children what they think they&#39;ll want to learn about for the year and use their ideas coupled with a few of my own to formulate the IHIP.  Quarterly reports are easy as I just mention a few of the things they&#39;ve done during the quarter.  Next year my oldest will be subjected to the whole testing situation.  I hate the thought of him being subjected to something so useless.  <br/>
<br/>
What are the ages of your children?  Mine are 10 ds, 7 dd, and 5 dd.<br/>
<br/>
How is the school district you live in with homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Mine is pretty good as long as you send in the paperwork.  Personally, I don&#39;t believe they ever really read the reports.  I was 2 mths. late on sending in a quarterly report once, because my mother in law was very sick, and all I received was a reminder notice.  When I did send in the report, I forgot to change the marking period # so they called me wondering what was going on.  I explained that I sent it in and through conversation, they realized they had it all along.  They were very nice the whole time.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it will stay that way, but you never know.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish you and your family well.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Regina</div>

I use something similar to this and plan on going more in this direction next <br/>
year.  You can also keep it simple and be really vague.  For example just say <br/>
that you&#39;ll be using library books for reading or any other subject.  If you <br/>
really think your child is into something and then later he decides he isn&#39;t, <br/>
you always have the option of stating on your quarterly report that you <br/>
decided to use or do something different.<br/>
<br/>
On quarterly reports you can just give a brief description of what you have <br/>
done.  As long as you list all required subjects for the grade level and say <br/>
you&#39;ve done something, the school district should accept your paperwork!  If <br/>
your kids are older they might enjoy doing this...making their own report card, <br/>
listing what they feel they have done in various subjects (this can get really <br/>
humorous), and giving themselves a grade. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I took that one and added some state standards language to it and a <br/>
little other stuff -- and wrote courses of study for elementary and <br/>
secondary students - this was for a private school in California, but <br/>
it would give you another &quot;unschooling curriculum&quot; to use if you have <br/>
to document stuff. I also think it would be very useful for people who <br/>
have to go to court to fight to continue homeschooling because of <br/>
custody issues or child protective services issues. It sounds probably <br/>
a bit more educationese - if that is needed.<br/>
<br/>
They are in the files area of this list - look for something like ACME <br/>
course of study.<br/>

It was like a DUH! moment --of course, I should have gone to Sandra&#39;s <br/>
site first. I&#39;m printing the article right now.<br/>
