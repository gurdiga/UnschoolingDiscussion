<div id="ygrps-yiv-352070619">Sierra picked up a line from the Madeline movie...&quot;I can do anything&quot;, and I<br/>
heard her saying it to herself a few times.<br/>
When she really wanted to learn how to ride a bike last year, she got<br/>
frustrated and I reminded her of the &quot;I can do anything&quot; phrase and<br/>
suggested she repeat it to herself when the going got tough. I heard her<br/>
muttering &quot;I can do ANYthing&quot; under her breath several times...she figured<br/>
that durn bike out in two days. It was quite amazing.<br/>
THat&#39;s her mantra now.<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my Mantra ;-) I personally loved this about Madeline....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do kids who haven&#39;t been in school experience boredom, or do they<br/>
&gt; &gt; entertain themselves more automatically?  Does &quot;deschooling&quot; get rid of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this if it is a school phenomena?  How do you all deal with boredom?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been having an experience with a friend&#39;s 5yo son. He enters K<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; year and has been in preschool for the past 2 years. We (myself and 2<br/>
kids)<br/>
&gt; went to the zoo with them last month and he declared each exhibit<br/>
&quot;B-o-r-r-ring!&quot;<br/>
&gt; He is unimpressed with most things and his mom talks about how she must<br/>
&gt; always entertain him. I can honestly say that my kids (who are young<br/>
still) have<br/>
&gt; never said that they are bored or even asked me to give them ideas of<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; to do.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;like the child is purposely going to NOT be careful? ...........Of<br/>
&gt; &gt;course the kids will be careful, why would they not be[?]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One of my son&#39;s friends is a 16 yo self-avowed Xtreme sports fan,<br/>
&gt; &gt;particularly of bikes and skateboards.  I have known this &quot;child&quot; for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;last 5 years.  Lots of problems.  His favorite past time is to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;push-the-envelope&quot; with his sports equipment.  It gets bloodier every<br/>
&gt; &gt;year.  The rest of the boys just think it&#39;s hilarious and stupid, but<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt;a tone of admiration thrown in.  He just got his drivers permit.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; but we are spending a lot of time watching the same<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; episodes of cartoons over and over and my mind is turning to mush.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you ask why that&#39;s a favorite episode, or comment on whatever you find<br/>
&gt; interesting?  Kirby and I used to discuss the methods and motivations of<br/>
&gt; Splinter, the Ninja Turtles&#39; teacher--why sometimes he would hang back and<br/>
let them<br/>
&gt; make decisions, but sometimes he didn&#39;t.   Those conversations invariably<br/>
&gt; touched on things in our own relationship, or in other families he knew.<br/>
We also<br/>
&gt; talked about voicework (one of Kirby&#39;s earliest interests was voice acting<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; cartoons and puppets--he figured out on his own really early that Mr.<br/>
Rogers<br/>
&gt; was doing more than one voice, and that Kermit was Bert with a different<br/>
tone<br/>
&gt; in the voice and so on, so I would research and supply him names and some<br/>
&gt; details and trivia, and he would tell me when one of the voice actors he<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; familiar with did a bit on another show or on a commercial.  He was always<br/>
right.<br/>
&gt; Just something he has the ability to hear.  Animaniacs was WAY fun for him<br/>
&gt; because he could tell me who was doing what.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; The funny thing about that is that Elmo, Bert & Ernie, Cookie Monster,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Big Bird, Snuffy, Oscar, etc. don&#39;t go to school.  Ever. They play and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; learn all day in freedom!  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; True!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a storybook about them being in school and doing a show and tell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve talked, here about how many of the PBS kids&#39; shows are about<br/>
emotions<br/>
&gt; and decision making and often in the context of preparing for school<br/>
&gt; specifically.  Dragontales is quite that direction.  Barney BIGtime.<br/>
Arthur.   I used<br/>
&gt; to tell Marty those things, but Holly tells me.  She&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey!  They<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; had this part because they want kids not to be afraid of school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Yep.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s not too evil a thing in a culture (or a family) which sees<br/>
school<br/>
&gt; as inevitable.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Not<br/>
&gt; one person said &quot;be careful&quot;--uh, I hate that phrase, like the child is<br/>
&gt; purposely going to NOT be careful?  I always want to say, when someone<br/>
&gt; says &quot;Drive carefully&quot;, &quot;thanks for reminding me, otherwise I might have<br/>
&gt; driven crazily, speeding and running stop signs and the like.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I try not to say those things to others too much, or maybe I still say<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; but I hear myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But when people say it to me, I don&#39;t mind.  When I&#39;m leaving on a car<br/>
trip<br/>
&gt; out of town, Keith always checklists me at the end:  water?  caffein?<br/>
snacks?<br/>
&gt; be careful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And when friends of mine say &quot;drive carefully&quot; I see it more as a kind of<br/>
&gt; blessing on the trip, like I have my own carefulness and theirs added to<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt; Keith often says &quot;Be safe,&quot; and in that wording it really IS just a<br/>
straight out<br/>
&gt; blessing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel like if five people told me to be careful I WOULD be more careful,<br/>
&gt; because in my head their voices would be there, and I would remember that<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; cared enough about me to be there when I was leaving and give me some<br/>
special<br/>
&gt; energy for the trip.  They could&#39;ve been in watching TV and eating, but<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; they gave me a &quot;fare well&quot; (another blessing which means just about the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; as the others).<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Although I believe these things were in my heart all along, the words<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; not mine to begin with...I borrow these thoughts/words all the time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; John Holt stirs up some stuff in me that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think when you read something that puts words to what you didn&#39;t have<br/>
words<br/>
&gt; for from some earlier point in your life, you end up reviewing lots of<br/>
prior<br/>
&gt; stuff, and it turns into your own words about your own experiences.  But<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; experiences seem locked up like rocks until someone identifies the<br/>
individual<br/>
&gt; parts of them for you somehow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s how it seems to me, anyway.  If it never occurred to &quot;an A<br/>
student,&quot;<br/>
&gt; for example that each A they got kept someone else from being top, they<br/>
might<br/>
&gt; never have thought of how important it might have been for the person who<br/>
kept<br/>
&gt; coming in second or third to be first JUST ONCE.  Of it might never have<br/>
&gt; occurred to someone who was great in gym or sports that other kids might<br/>
have been<br/>
&gt; trying MUCH harder and wanting success MUCH more, but just didn&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt; talent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reviewing those kinds of things in new light can make it EASY in some ways<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; see what unschooled kids need and need to avoid, and what we can say or<br/>
point<br/>
&gt; out to them to help them be compassionate about other kids&#39; relative<br/>
talents<br/>
&gt; and successes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people&#39;s childhood memories are almost completely closed off, and so<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t have that to draw on and are somewhat at a disadvantage in<br/>
&gt; understanding what kids are thinking and feeling.   It&#39;s better if you can<br/>
remember being<br/>
&gt; eight instead of just trusting that you must have been, and having a<br/>
photo,<br/>
&gt; but no real memories.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s one thing to just quote a person.  It&#39;s a whole other thing to filter<br/>
&gt; your memories through their words or ideas so that you end up maybe saying<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same things, only behind the words you have vivid real KNOWLEDGE of how<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; worked (or didn&#39;t) in your life and how it is working in your child&#39;s<br/>
life.<br/>

&gt; Subject: name calling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;On another network&quot;  it is being claimed that on this list people are<br/>
&gt; &quot;called names.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been called names.  But usually by people who aren&#39;t being very<br/>
&gt; rational, so I don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any &quot;names&quot; people have been called to throw out here so<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; can consider whether that claim is true?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The claim was (I think, from what I was forwarded) that the main core of<br/>
&gt; people here (? or just me?  me and some?) call people names, and that it&#39;s<br/>
all in<br/>
&gt; the archives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, and since there are some people on both lists, I<br/>
&gt; thought if it IS true, people here should be easily able to name those<br/>
kinds of<br/>
&gt; names people have been called.   I know I&#39;ve said lots of times that some<br/>
&gt; recommended or proposed action or behavior wasn&#39;t the closest way to get<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  I can&#39;t think of times it involved calling a person a name.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Without quoting who and to whom, can we come up with a list of these names<br/>
&gt; people have been called?   If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m just losing my memory, I<br/>
guess.<br/>
&gt; Help!<br/>

parents<br/>

&gt; we lived before that and the people who lived near, but not much more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Part of it, I feel, is that I had no sibs then, to back up my memories.  I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get sibs until my mom remarried and had my first brother when I was<br/>
&gt; 19.  (At 36 I have 17 and 14 year old brothers (mom&#39;s) and an almost 12<br/>
year<br/>
&gt; old sister (dad&#39;s))<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I also just don&#39;t remember much of anything before the day my folks<br/>
&gt; brought me in and said Dad was moving out.  Oh, and my mom swears I<br/>
actually<br/>
&gt; helped my dad move into his bachelor pad.  Uhm, ok Mom, I beleive you<br/>
&gt; but....NOTHING!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s what, no real memories from before age 10?  My husband talks<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; remembering Kindergarten and earlier.  Nope, not me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder how much of that has to do with not being able to get into the<br/>
head<br/>
&gt; of my 7 year old sometimes.   Weird, I just never put the two together.<br/>
&gt; Have to really think about this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gee, thanks Sandra!  -grin-<br/>
