<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080881586">Sunday night my mother-in-law called again.  And once again she asked <br/>
me about my son&#39;s &quot;lessons&quot;  The last time she called she asked me if <br/>
he could spell his name yet (he&#39;s almost 4), he can but that&#39;s not <br/>
the point.  This time she asked me what he was learning.  I told her <br/>
he was playing games on the computer and going to take horse training <br/>
soon.  She asked me if he was doing any school lessons on the <br/>
computer.  I told her he&#39;d learned his alphabet using the computer <br/>
(he did partially) Then she asked me if any of his friends were going <br/>
to public school soon.  I was happy to tell her he has a friend being <br/>
unschooled, she made a hrumpf sound and ignored the unschooling <br/>
part.  I&#39;m not sure she knows what unschooling is.  I was a little <br/>
irritated by then and moved off the topic.  I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
grilled on lessons and what he&#39;s learning for the next decade.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been forthright with her in the past and it&#39;s a very unsatifying <br/>
experience.  She&#39;s passive-aggressive and tends to smile and keep on <br/>
doing whatever she&#39;s doing.  A hard type for me to deal with.  I know <br/>
she cares about her grandson&#39;s future and the questions come from a <br/>
place of concern.  But she&#39;s not going to be the only family member <br/>
to question me.  I don&#39;t want to have to justify our choice <br/>
constantly.  How have some of you dealt with this sort of thing?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421697118">I lent a book out to a friend who constantly questioned my &quot;credentials&quot; to teach my son. I think the book was &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;. It is the only book I actually own that would vaguely relate to the subject. She stopped questioning me after that. Now she only asks &quot;How&#39;s homeschooling going?&quot; or &quot;Did you start schooling for the boys yet?&quot; Then I explained that we homeschool year round b/c we unschool. I even offered to print off something for her to read about unschooling. She declined and took my word for it. But she doesn&#39;t nag like before.<br/>
<br/>
As for my family members... A few of my siblings (17 of them) voiced their concerns and I was happy to respond to them. They don&#39;t meddle as much as the moms do. <br/>
<br/>
Mom Carol in MT thinks it&#39;s cool. But she&#39;s more like I am. Actually, that side of the family thinks it&#39;s wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
But Mom Deb asked questions and asked when I was sending him back to school and why was I doing this and on and on... I finally just told her that if she refused to read up on it, then the it was off topic and I&#39;d gladly hang up on her if she asked again. Although I ticked her off, she she hasn&#39;t asked again... she also hasn&#39;t read anything on homeschooling, unschooling, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Mom Carol in TX wasn&#39;t happy about it at first. She questioned me and really voiced her discontent with it. She would say things like &quot;Well, we&#39;ll see how you&#39;re doing when they test him.&quot; Well, I can get around the tests, which didn&#39;t make her happy. She asked if I was going to homeschool them forever... I said &quot;Gosh NO! Once their 18, they are free to do as they wish.&quot; :) And she continued with the socialization thing, implying that I kept them locked in the house day in and day out... &quot;It&#39;s nice you guys are going to the fireworks with friends, those kids need to get out and be around people.&quot; I told her we do that PLENTY! In fact, that is everyones big concern but some won&#39;t listen. I emailed her website after website about homeschooling and how healthy it is (I try to stay positive). She harped and moaned and complained... Then my sister got hooked on drugs, lost custody of her kids, dropped off the face of the planet only to reappear in the county jail for assault on an officer, hit and run, drugs in possession, warrants out for her (one is for felony assault on an elderly), and failure to appear in court. Suddenly my choice to be a parent full time didn&#39;t look so bad. She hasn&#39;t said word one, in negativity, to me since. <br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad I live WAY over here and they are all WAY of there... (other sides of the country)<br/>
<br/>
I guess teh best way to deal with negateers is to educate them. If they refuse then it is a mute subject. <br/>

I hope she&#39;ll read it, or read SOMETHING that will give you common ground.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell ANYONE that if they were unwilling to learn on <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970358180">Thanks for the suggestion.  I&#39;m willing to try this but I see it <br/>
working better with my mother than with my mother-in-law.  My husband <br/>
told me he doesn&#39;t remember her ever reading (on her own or to him).  <br/>
She came here from Jamaica and trusted wholely in the school system.  <br/>
He says she basically looked at the report card and that was it.  My <br/>
mother likes the idea of homeschooling (I haven&#39;t mentioned <br/>
unschooling) but has questioned me about socialization.  Which is <br/>
funny because when I was a kid we were discouraged from associating <br/>
with the &quot;worldly&quot; children in the schools because we were Jehovah&#39;s <br/>
Witnesses (or rather my parents were, I was never a Jehovah&#39;s Witness <br/>
in my mind).  Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-167409723">I&#39;m going to get this books too (along with Dumbing Us Down).  I <br/>
think of school the same way I think on the rap subject.  It&#39;s a <br/>
sympton of larger issues in the country, the world and in life.  My <br/>
own experience at school was definately exasperated by dysfunction at <br/>
home.  Everything is connected.  The dysfunction of individuals can&#39;t <br/>
be separated from the whole system.  Blaming school is superficial.  <br/>
I know my parents own ignorance of certain things played a bigger <br/>
role in my life than ignorant or well-meaning teachers ever did (I <br/>
barely remember <br/>
their faces)  I unschool because I believe change begins at home and <br/>
I&#39;ll be responsible if I don&#39;t do what I know is best for my child.<br/>

&gt; grilled on lessons and what he&#39;s learning for the next decade.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been forthright with her in the past and it&#39;s a very unsatifying<br/>

&gt; constantly.  How have some of you dealt with this sort of thing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take a page from her book and refuse to engage what you don&#39;t want to. :)<br/>
<br/>
Her: &quot;Is Bartholomew doing his school lessons today?&quot;<br/>
You: &quot;Oh, I think he&#39;s learning lots! How&#39;s your gout?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just deflect, change the subject, and move on. If you think she&#39;s at all<br/>
educable on the subject, give her a few non-hair-raising homeschooling books<br/>
for Christmas (&quot;I thought since you were so interested, you&#39;d love to read<br/>
these!&quot;) or her birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do, don&#39;t get into a wrestling match. Don&#39;t justify. Don&#39;t get<br/>
defensive. If it gets bad, say, &quot;Oops! Bartholomew wants me to help him<br/>
build a space shuttle, gotta go!&quot; (This is not a lie: I&#39;ll bet your almost-4<br/>
year old does want you to help him build a space shuttle &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
I used to try to explain homeschooling and unschooling to people who just<br/>
wanted to argue. You realize the futility fast. Be kind because she probably<br/>
has honest concerns, but don&#39;t beat your head against that particular brick<br/>
wall.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243903324">I read that book and the other one he wrote The Myth<br/>
of ADD.  I think our dysfunction often times does<br/>
begin  at home, even before we are out of the womb.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like to generalize that all schools are bad, but<br/>
my experience with my children is that the whole idea<br/>
of the way schools are set up reinforce that<br/>
dysfunction.  I have to say that 50% of my unschooling<br/>
day is spent trying to undo all of the damage done to<br/>
them by me when I was in the &quot;the more control you<br/>
have over the child the better parent you are&quot; mode. <br/>
And coupled with that my three older children are also<br/>
deschooling from their experiences, so they have a<br/>
double whammy.  My younger son who has never been in<br/>
school is probably more ahead.  Does any of this make<br/>
any sense.  I love Thomas Armstrongs books and his<br/>
perspective.<br/>

&gt; unschooling <br/>
&gt; part.  I&#39;m not sure she knows what unschooling is. <br/>
&gt; I was a little <br/>
&gt; irritated by then and moved off the topic.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to be <br/>
&gt; grilled on lessons and what he&#39;s learning for the<br/>
&gt; next decade.  I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; been forthright with her in the past and it&#39;s a very<br/>
&gt; unsatifying <br/>
&gt; experience.  She&#39;s passive-aggressive and tends to<br/>
&gt; smile and keep on <br/>
&gt; doing whatever she&#39;s doing.  A hard type for me to<br/>
&gt; deal with.  I know <br/>
&gt; she cares about her grandson&#39;s future and the<br/>
&gt; questions come from a <br/>
&gt; place of concern.  But she&#39;s not going to be the<br/>
&gt; only family member <br/>
&gt; to question me.  I don&#39;t want to have to justify our<br/>
&gt; choice <br/>
&gt; constantly.  How have some of you dealt with this<br/>
&gt; sort of thing?  <br/>

change at age 2 or so.  After that I cried very easily over anything.  (No, <br/>
I&#39;ve never been able to remember anything traumatic that took place then, <br/>
and neither could my mother.)  I think that encouraged my sister (4 1/2 <br/>
years older) to start teasing me unmercifully.  She knew she could always <br/>
get a reaction from me.  When I started school, I continued in the same <br/>
vein, crying easily over little things.  The kids figured out really <br/>
quickly that they could make me cry.  That continued on all the way through <br/>
elementary school.  So my fragile personality from my home life made me an <br/>
easy mark which made me even more fragile emotionally.  So what caused <br/>
what?   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Lots of people from all over the world studying and talking about the<br/>
problem. I doubt they&#39;d be studying it and holding conferences on something<br/>
unique to the US ;-) Looks like only 4 speakers maybe from the US amongst<br/>
many many speakers. Not at all heavily weighted towards the US.<br/>

respect being taught along with discipline. It&#39;s sad to hear that they seem <br/>
to be headed in the same direction as us. I guess we really are becoming a <br/>
global society. What you say about respect being an important part of a good <br/>
upbringing, makes sense. I frequently meet people who are very foggy about <br/>
their moral values. This is why I really liked Bob&#39;s post where he said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not confusing anything. All of us have compelling reasons to ignore the <br/>
oughts and shoulds in life; and to want to silence others at times. We also <br/>
often have the freedom to do as much. But should we? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Should we use our overwhelming democratic votes or majority position (or <br/>
freedom) to get what we want and control others and ignore what we know is <br/>
wrong or right?<br/>

I am not a religious person, but I do think that in a more innocent time when <br/>
people believed in an all knowing and judgmental God, that belief may have <br/>
given them pause to ask themselves: &quot;Should we?&quot;<br/>

They&#39;re not unschoolers, but big advocates of delayed academics. They make a <br/>
very convincing argument as to the damage that can be done with pushing <br/>
academics on young children. I realizes this is not entirely the approach <br/>
you are taking, but it might be a way to ease her worries while you continue <br/>
to unschool. And it might get her off your back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious just how they taught respect.  I doubt they did it by treating <br/>
the kids with respect, which I think is the only way to teach *real* <br/>
respect.  In other words, I think what usually passes for respect is <br/>
obedience and politeness rather than true respect.  At least my experiences <br/>
with the German half of my family would lead me to believe that it was the <br/>
former.<br/>

in my life.  So many of them are just other people&#39;s ideas of what I should <br/>
do and aren&#39;t necessarily the right thing to do.  It isn&#39;t always easy to <br/>
listen to that inner voice and follow it, but that&#39;s what I try to do.<br/>

of one hand, for instance, the number of times the person I voted for <br/>
actually won.  %^ (<br/>
<br/>
Majority rule without minority rights scares the hell out of me.  I heard a <br/>
news story about an Islamic rally in (I think) London.  The spokesperson <br/>
said that they were fighting for Britain and eventually the whole world to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530591105">Dotchi, (and all on this board, of course)  you made some really good points <br/>
in your post.  My m-i-l was concerned about the socialization issue too.  My <br/>
daughter is 9 y/o and has been in catholic and public school and an in-home <br/>
day care.  She also has many friends around our neighborhood and around the <br/>
homes of my family and friends.  I just started homeschooling her 2 days ago. <br/>
 I am letting her do her own thing (as well as some-UGH- worksheets, for <br/>
hubby&#39;s sake).  My m-i-l thinks she should go to the ps here in town.  My <br/>
daughter learns more by just being home and doing what she&#39;s interested in.  <br/>
Our schools here have at least 25 different cultures in which the kids only <br/>
speak their language.  How would my dd learn or socialize in that situation?  <br/>
I love learning along with her.  I&#39;ll tell you, I went to catholic school for <br/>
12 years.  I learned that religion had to do with every subject.  (if you <br/>
don&#39;t do your homework, God will punish you!).  I learned that I could buy a <br/>
fake id that I could buy alcohol with (those computer students were smart).  <br/>
I learned that drugs could be bought in the parking lot (dad, I need more <br/>
lunch money for an xtra milk today).  I learned that if you told the nun that <br/>
you were going to become a nun, she would believe you were an angel (while <br/>
the whole class laughed!)  I learned these and so many other things in <br/>
school.  No wonder I&#39;d rather have my child at home with me where I can keep <br/>
her safe and answer her questions about the dangers of drugs and other <br/>
things.  I had to learn the hard way & I hope she never does.<br/>
OK.  This post is now open to all criticisms!  LOL!<br/>
Have a great day all!<br/>

&gt; &lt;I went to catholic school for<br/>
&gt; 12 years.  learned that religion had to do with every subject.  (if you<br/>
don&#39;t do your homework, God will punish you!). &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is really timely for me. We&#39;ve always homeschooled, sometimes<br/>
unschooled, now only unschooling. :-) We are Catholic. We go to the Latrin<br/>
Mass.. I&#39;ve just been slammed by some email friends about being a Catholic<br/>
and an unschooler - they don&#39;t see the two as compatable.  Worse than that -<br/>
they say I&#39;m leading myself and my kids into heresy...So, it really helps me<br/>
to see that Catholic education, in schools or in school at home, is not all<br/>
its cracked up to be...Leonie W.<br/>
