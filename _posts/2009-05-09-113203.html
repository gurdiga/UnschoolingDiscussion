<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020598432">Hello Sandra--I am a radical unschooling mom and I just started a new  <br/>
list dedicated to unschooling resources (apparently the old one no  <br/>
longer exists).  I would like to promote it on AL (and also  <br/>
Unschooling Discussion--you are moderator of that one as well,  <br/>
right?).  Is this OK?  Also, if you think it is worthy, I would be  <br/>
thrilled if you mentioned it on the links section of your website.   <br/>
Thank you for all you have done for unschooling. Here is the link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolsupplies/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolsupplies/</a><br/>
<br/>
And here is the description:<br/>
<br/>
Unschool Supplies is a list where families can discover and share  <br/>
resources that contribute to a rich environment for learning and  <br/>
living. Contributions may include favorite games, crafts, activities,  <br/>
projects, clubs, as well as reviews of useful books, websites,  <br/>
catalogues, toys, and equipment. In addition, members are welcome to  <br/>
ask for information on a particular area of interest--how to best help  <br/>
a child with a passion for building circuit boards, or raising  <br/>
rabbits, or whatever...<br/>
<br/>
It is also a place where unschoolers of all ages can &quot;show and tell&quot;  <br/>
their projects and hobbies. Pictures and stories of other people&#39;s  <br/>
creations are an incomparable source of inspiration and creative  <br/>
synergy. Learning about other people&#39;s interests and accomplishments  <br/>
can expand our understanding of what is possible and help take the  <br/>
fear out of exploring unfamiliar territory.<br/>
<br/>
We can also share ways in which we organize (or disorganize) our homes  <br/>
in order to foster learning and creativity while also facilitating  <br/>
family life. How do we transform our homes to meet the different needs  <br/>
of all family members? An ersatz &quot;Unschooling Homes and Gardens&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, contributions will be compiled on a sister website in  <br/>
order to provide unschoolers with an easily accessible, one-stop-shop  <br/>
for ideas, supplies, and inspiration.<br/>
