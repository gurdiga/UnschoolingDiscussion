<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641572061">Okay, when I checked into a package deal with SBC back before <br/>
Christmas, the ONLY reason we could not get the deal is because DSL is <br/>
not available in our area.  Nor can we get cable.  We do have satellite <br/>
(God&#39;s answer to the rural folk who wish to watch more than 3 <br/>
channels).  So now the question is will the router work with dial up?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046291783">Heh.  <br/>
<br/>
The other night, my DD(6) looked around at myself, my DW, DD(17), DMiL, and<br/>
DSBiL (step-brother-in-law) all sitting around the living room, surfing on<br/>
our respective laptops, and said, &quot;I wish I had a laptop, too!&quot;  Okay, so<br/>
things have gotten a bit carried away here.<br/>
<br/>
I have Comcast cable internet ($55/mo), and a standard wireless router (the<br/>
same model - the Linksys WRT54G - is available now for about $50).  We&#39;ve<br/>
switched over to Lingo voice over internet telephone service (~$25/mo),<br/>
which gives us unlimited long distance to the US, Canada, and most of<br/>
Western Europe.  <br/>
<br/>
Our total home telecoms expense is about $80/mo, which compares favorably<br/>
with our old local phone service (which was running us ~$65/month) plus a<br/>
standard dialup account (say AOL, at $25/mo).  And we have the whole wealth<br/>
of the Internet available to everyone in the house, as fast as we could like<br/>
it - and we can call our relatives and former exchange students at no<br/>
additional expense.<br/>
<br/>
Before we went wireless, I had run wires through much of the house, and I<br/>
can tell you for certain that wireless is easier.  Do read up a bit on<br/>
securing your wireless network (the key acronym here is &quot;WEP&quot; - wireless<br/>
encryption protocol), as otherwise hackers passing by on the street may be<br/>
able to see into your computers.<br/>
<br/>
If your existing computers are not set up for wireless access, you can add a<br/>
card to handle it for about $10-15 per machine.  (Adding a card like this to<br/>
a laptop is as simple as plugging it in to the side of the machine; a<br/>
desktop is only a tiny bit harder, really!)<br/>
<br/>
If you have a large house, be aware that wireless networking does have a<br/>
somewhat limited range -- more than a few dozen feet away, or any<br/>
substantial amounts of metalwork in the intervening walls, and you may lose<br/>
your network signal, or suffer slowed-down connections.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that this helps -- finally, a topic here that I actually<br/>
know a bit about!  :-)<br/>

We are moving to the country in a month and this is what we are doing<br/>
(satellite internet).  We can&#39;t wait!  We almost always have at least 5<br/>
computers on the internet at once.  There are other companies as well,<br/>
but we like this one the best.  We wouldn&#39;t be happy Unschoolers without<br/>
our computers!  We can (and do) live without a landline phone, but<br/>
internet connection is non-negotiable.  :)<br/>
