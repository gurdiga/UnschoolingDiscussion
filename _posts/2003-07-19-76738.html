<div id="ygrps-yiv-741797268">I heard John Taylor Gatto speak this past May at homeschooling day at Six<br/>
Flags America.  He spoke of a homeschooling Mom in Utah who had several<br/>
children who all received degrees from community ofr 4-year colleges at very<br/>
young ages.  Does anyone know of this family and if there is any info<br/>
available about them on the internet?<br/>
Thank you, Annette</div>
