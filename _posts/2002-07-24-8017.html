<div id="ygrps-yiv-164258784">Hi all -<br/>
I just want to let you know what&#39;s going on around here (MD) regarding this <br/>
topic in case it may be relevant to any of you....<br/>
<br/>
A group of us got together several months ago to set up a full time resource <br/>
center....we sent out a survey and found that we didn&#39;t have enough of a mass <br/>
of people interested and also that the majority of interested folks were <br/>
school at homers looking for classes and science equipment.....<br/>
<br/>
We just wanted a place to hang out and let magical sparks fly!<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the plan is to rent a community center for 2-3 days a month from <br/>
morning til night....it&#39;ll have a nice outdoor space and indoor space with a <br/>
kitchen....it&#39;ll be a time to hang out, do projects together, do projects <br/>
alone, read, knit, whatever........&#39;working&#39; spouses can join us too since we <br/>
would stay into the evening....aside from that, there are gatherings and <br/>
field trips that happen otherwise during the month.....I think some of the <br/>
kids will use the time/space to have &#39;club meetings&#39; too....hopefully we can <br/>
leave some items there in a storage area....<br/>
<br/>
Membership would be required bec. of the rental agreement.....but it looks <br/>
like it&#39;ll be about $15-20 per month or so....<br/>
<br/>
We decided that renting space (instead of using our homes) is preferable bec. <br/>
it allows for growth without the size and nbr restrictions.....<br/>
<br/>
From that, further discussions regarding non-profit status and pursuing a <br/>
space more available could happen....but for now, this plan of meeting <br/>
several times a month meets our interests/needs....<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the space will come through!<br/>

business is up and running and not in infancy stages), I&#39;m going to actively<br/>
work on setting up a resource center here.<br/>
