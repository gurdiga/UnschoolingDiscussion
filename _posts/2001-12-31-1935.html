<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822185774">I want to wish everyone a joyful new year!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m busy cooking for tomorrow&#39;s feast. I know that there are a few others in <br/>
the country that cook a traditional New Year&#39;s dinner, but here in the South, <br/>
it&#39;s ham, collards, black-eye peas, rice (the peas and rice together are <br/>
&quot;hoppin&#39; johns&quot;), and cornbread.<br/>
<br/>
These five &quot;soul foods&quot; have meaning I thought I&#39;d share for those that <br/>
haven&#39;t heard.<br/>
<br/>
Ham is a symbol of wealth and prosperity.<br/>
Collards represent dollars.<br/>
Black-eye peas represent pennies.<br/>
Rice is for fertility. (I eat little rice!;-)<br/>
And cornbread stands for gold bricks or coins.<br/>
<br/>
Together they are lucky, &quot;feel-good&quot;, comfort food!<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best in the New Year!<br/>

for good luck.  My husbands family always makes sausage and sauerkraut.<br/>

<br/>
My mom used to do ham for Easter.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the &quot;We aren&#39;t JEWISH!&quot; symbol.<br/>
<br/>
On New Year&#39;s she&#39;d make us black-eyed peas and corn bread.<br/>
<br/>
But we were in New Mexico, and the New Mexico New Year&#39;s Day good-luck food <br/>
is posole.<br/>
<br/>
Posole doesn&#39;t translate directly into an English food.  It is SORT OF hominy <br/>
with pork and red chile.<br/>
<br/>
Posole doesn&#39;t start in a can, it starts as dried or preserved and frozen <br/>
treated corn (like hominy, but I&#39;ve only ever seen hominy in a can).  You <br/>
cook it without much stirring so it stays as whole as possible.  And there&#39;s <br/>
pork roast cut small in there.  Not salt pork, and not ham.  Real pork.  And <br/>
there&#39;s red chile sauce, which is usually added to each bowl, as much as the <br/>
diner wants.  It&#39;s always in a bowl.  And you eat tortillas with it.<br/>
<br/>
The same way you don&#39;t get black-eyed peas in restaurants (unless at Daisy <br/>
Mae&#39;s or Black-Eyed Pea or another southern-food-for-those-who-miss-it <br/>
place), posole is home food.  Or little cafe food.   You can get it on the <br/>
side sometimes in restaurants, but it&#39;s not a real main menu item.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here half an inch from the internet and it occurs to me there <br/>
might be a photo.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
This is just wrong.  Christmas EVE?  <br/>
Whatever, as long as they keep the leftovers for New Year&#39;s Day.<br/>
And that is way too much chile, but it&#39;s floating on the top (the redness) so <br/>
it&#39;s less than it looks.  So don&#39;t count on that one photo.  It&#39;s wrong. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
And forget putting onion in it.  This is not the time for onion. (Mexican, he <br/>
said; I&#39;m looking again for northern New Mexico, what I&#39;m used to.  &lt;A <br/>

holiday tradition&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something with commentary, no photo.  WAY too artsy (juniper berries, <br/>
YUCK; chicken bouillon!?  NOT)<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve had it in San Ildefonso Pueblo too.  At a Christmas feast.  <br/>
Blue corn is a recent weirdness, not an old tradition.  <br/>
Multi-colored corn was common here for a long time, but to breed for blue and <br/>
use it to charge a dollar more at a restaurant is within the past 25 years.<br/>

Resolutions:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make resolutions, and I think they&#39;re a bad idea. Deciding today what I want to hold important a year from now sets me up for failure.<br/>
<br/>
Deciding that I want to make many good moments tomorrow, though, I can do with confidence and the expectation of success. I can&#39;t live a year at a time. I can&#39;t live a week, nor even a whole day at a time. I can only make a choice in this moment (or fail to remember to do so).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944780004">Resolutions are the most infamous set of unattained goals for most people each year. I&#39;ve read a lot recently from writers with a different take on goals, and our goal (and associated failure)-oriented society.<br/>
<br/>
One take from a non-unschooling (though he likes a lot of the ideas) writer talked about the idea of themes instead of goals, and I like it. He wrote a long blog post (and his are both very long and tend to go through an interestingly convoluted story before reaching some kind of list), that ended with the following part that flows from what Sandra posted:<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
&quot;Having goals is no good.<br/>
 <br/>
Goals, in an extreme, mean you aren&#39;t happy until you get your goal. And then what? How can you reduce suffering right now. The suffering of striving, of fear, of worry, of the pressure that you have no goals.<br/>
 <br/>
Have a theme. You can build your days around your themes. I want to learn more. I want to be healthy. I want to be good to people. I want to help people feel good about themselves. I want to be creative. I want to depend on my inward self instead of the outer events that throw from shore to shore.<br/>
 <br/>
An important theme for me is to every day focus on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health as much as possible. For me, I know that works. Works for what? Who cares. It just works. Whatever your theme is, check it throughout the day  Ask: am I living by my theme?<br/>
 <br/>
In the short blink that thins out your life, when you reach the point where  goals matter no more, the themes of your life will still shine bright. And when it comes time to measure your immortality, it&#39;s the themes you leave behind that will have more impact than the goals, money, loves, lives you&#39;ve lived.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(from James Altucher&#39;s post: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/i-need-a-check-for-one-million-dollars/)">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/i-need-a-check-for-one-million-dollars/)</a><br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Think about the themes you want in your life, and decide each moment to move closer to them, instead of further away. Thanks Sandra and company on this list for helping our family do this with the theme of applying Unschooling ideas to our life, for the themes of greater learning, happiness, and connectedness in our family.<br/>
<br/>
Happy new year everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Jamie (the Dad)<br/>

<br/>
I like having goals and projects. I like lists, making them and checking things off on them. If I find some part of my list or some goal unobtainable, I re-evaluate. I might break it down into smaller parts or move it to a longer time-table, or simply decide I don&#39;t ever need to acheive that thing. Lately I&#39;ve been restless and dissatisfied in a sort of general way, so yesterday I spend some time making new goals, new project lists, reorgainizing the projects I have for winter when I have less space to work. It was satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
Goals don&#39;t have to be an extreme of &quot;aren&#39;t happy until you get it&quot; or the extreme of &quot;I&#39;ll never do it so why bother&quot;. There&#39;s a middle ground - maybe that&#39;s a personality thing, though, and for some people goals are only one thing or another?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find this too. I find the beginning of a new year (or sometimes a new month, or even a new day) to be a good time to re-evaluate what I’m doing, what’s working, and what’s not. Some of my goals are concrete, mostly related to work (I work from home) and ways to achieve it with the minimum of disruption to time with my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is another side to resolutions though. They aren’t always goal orientated. They could be decisions about how you want your life to be better, and things to consider as you go about your year. In other words, they could be based on principles, not rules.<br/>
<br/>
I think if people made a goal to say yes more, then that would improve their year, and their children’s year. It’s not a measureable goal, and it’s hard to fail unless you completely ignore it, but every unthinking no that is reconsidered is a win.<br/>
