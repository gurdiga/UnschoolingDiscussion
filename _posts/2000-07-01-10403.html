<div id="ygrps-yiv-740712684">Please feel free to forward this request to anyone whom you think might be<br/>
interested, especially local hsing group lists across the country.<br/>
<br/>
Your Voice is Needed/Help Needed/Information Needed<br/>
<br/>
The National Home Education Network, NHEN, is now into an intensive<br/>
month-long look at homeschooled teens and young adults. The result will be a<br/>
teens/young adults area of the NHEN website (similar in format to the New<br/>
Homeschoolers area - if you haven&#39;t seen it yet, go have a look at<br/>
www.nhen.org - click on &quot;New Homeschoolers&quot;). We&#39;ll also do a spotlight piece<br/>
on teens/young adults in NHENotes, our email newsletter, and it will one of<br/>
the topics featured in our Fall issue of  VOICES, the Journal of the National<br/>
Home Education Network.<br/>
<br/>
This organization is all about homeschoolers doing for themselves -- so this<br/>
is where you come in. We&#39;ve created a structure within which to build<br/>
ourselves a forum where all the diverse voices of homeschoolers across this<br/>
country, from every homeschooling style, from every religion or background,<br/>
can be heard.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;experts&quot; here are those who are reading this -- homeschoolers<br/>
themselves. We need people like you to grab one of these topics and research<br/>
it a bit -- send in whatever you find that you think would be relevant to<br/>
teens/young adults and their parents. Have some ideas you&#39;d like to express?<br/>
Write an article yourself -- let your voice be heard - long or short, in your<br/>
own chosen format. Or find articles that really speak to you and lets see if<br/>
we can include them. Find websites that have great information. Find email<br/>
lists that you think are valuable. Do you know of books or other publications<br/>
that contain useful information? Write a short description. What about events<br/>
or places to go? Anything else?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to get seriously involved in this effort, helping plan and<br/>
coordinate it, contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:PSoroosh@...">PSoroosh@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to pass along some information or submit an article, send it to<br/>
me, too.<br/>
<br/>
The following list is a &quot;tickler&quot; list --- ideas that have been brainstormed<br/>
for the kinds of material people might like to include.  Feel free to add to<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
This material needs to come in quickly. My deadline to have all material<br/>
organized and edited is July 20th. Please, if you have any inclination to<br/>
help out, don&#39;t procrastinate. I&#39;d sure be thrilled to have stuff flowing in<br/>
right away.<br/>
