<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I guess my think ing is this . . .<br/>
&gt; I know lots of assicts and alcoholics.  Theya ll seem to fall into<br/>
&gt; two categories . . . those who came from poor innercity places where<br/>
&gt; drinking and drugs were an escape of sorts and a way to cope the<br/>
&gt; otehr type are those who come from mid to upper-class homes where<br/>
&gt; they were expected to be exactly what the parents wanted or the<br/>
&gt; parents were very authoritarian or who were never shown love, only<br/>
&gt; given stuff and money.<br/>
&gt; But I can&#39;t think of a simgle person who had parents who were<br/>
&gt; interrested in them but not in a controlling way who went on to have<br/>
&gt; these problems.<br/>
&gt; But I can only say that in anecdotal at best and can&#39;t be used as a<br/>
&gt; complete model of reality.  It is truly just what I see around me and<br/>
&gt; have experienced in the past.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909544455">I&#39;ve often wondered if this category produces many of the seemingly new<br/>
trend on childhood psych diagnoses.  When the child becomes difficult to<br/>
&quot;handle&quot;  they go to the doc and try to medicate the &quot;problem&quot; away...or at<br/>
least put the child as the center of the problem....it couldn&#39;t be the<br/>
parents!  (PLEASE NOTE:  I mean no offense to anyone with a genuine problem<br/>
or diagnosis....and yes,  I do think it can be a real issue.  I&#39;m just<br/>
trying to say that some who fit into Lynda&#39;s &#39;third category&#39;  may think of<br/>
common childhood behavior as too much of a crimp in their lifestyle)<br/>
sheesh,  I&#39;m tired and so are the three whiny ones coming to hang on<br/>
me....TTFN,<br/>

There is a third category we use to see where I worked.  They were usually<br/>
from upper middle class and well to do families.  It was like the parents<br/>
had kids because it was the thing to do and then they ignored them.  Kinda<br/>
like some folks buy pets and then ignore them.  And then when there was a<br/>
problem, it was &quot;I just don&#39;t understand&quot; and &quot;How can he/she/they do this<br/>
to me.&quot;<br/>
