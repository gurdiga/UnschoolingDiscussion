<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010348171">Hello!<br/>
  I live in Toledo and we are planning a move to Michigan soon. I would like <br/>
to find a homeschooling list on yahoogroups for Michigan, but can&#39;t access <br/>
the website so I&#39;ll have to sub by email. Does anyone know of any MI lists or <br/>
could some kind soul look some up for me? (Not necssarily unschooling, just <br/>
homeschool in general would do)<br/>
Thanks in advance!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574362487">If you can get to any websites at all, this one has lots of Michigan links.  <br/>
If you see one you really like here, but you cannot get to the page (and if <br/>
someone from Michigan hasn&#39;t already hooked you up), write to me on the side <br/>
and I&#39;ll go back in there and see how you can directly subscribe.<br/>
