 </span></blockquote>I used the non-diaper method with the first one but cloth diapers (or <br/>
nappies as we call &#39;em) with the other two. Didn&#39;t have time to watch <br/>
for the subtle signals with the youngest 2 as I had 3 under 3. With <br/>
number 4 I might use the non-nappy method again although it will be Feb <br/>
when&#39;s its born and therefore a bit chilly.<br/>
I need to think beyond the birth!!! I&#39;m a bit nervous about a vbac after <br/>
3 c-sections.<br/>

that list who&#39;ve had a vbac after 2 or 3 sections. One did it after 5!!!<br/>
