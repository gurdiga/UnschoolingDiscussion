<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546606893"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I sorta cringe everytime another homeschooler makes the news for adademic<br/>
&gt; success. It&#39;s already as if homeschoolers are being held to a MUCH higher<br/>
&gt; standard or else people label it a failure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I have an early reader, quick, bright, and all that.  So what.  I&#39;m<br/>
not keeping score, and I feel like people see him as a &quot;typical&quot;<br/>
homeschooler, which he&#39;s anything but.  I don&#39;t need to tell people that he<br/>
has failings, but of course he has them.  Just because a child reads well<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they can write, for example.  My son can hardly form the<br/>
letters with a pencil.  He types everything.  Geography bee winners can<br/>
probably tell you six other things they do well, but aren&#39;t likely to let<br/>
you know that they still don&#39;t understand kitchen fractions or whatever!  Do<br/>
those failings make homeschooling a failure?  Of course not!<br/>
