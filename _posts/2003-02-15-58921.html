&lt;&lt; I did not make Jason change into<br/>
pjs. How would he learn that he was supposed to wear pjs.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s parents, the very conservative folks, wear full pajamas every night, <br/>
even when they&#39;re camping in their camper trailer.<br/>
<br/>
My dad slept in his underwear and my mom would wear long flannel gowns, and <br/>
wake up and put a robe over and leave that on a long time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith sleeps naked unless there&#39;s a kid sleeping with him, and then he wears <br/>
underwear (afraid to get us in trouble, he said, and it makes sense).   I <br/>
sleep in t-shirt and underwear.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby slept in sweats until he got to where he liked just a t-shirt and boxer <br/>
shorts better.  For a few years he was shy for anyone to see him in boxers.  <br/>
Now he just parades around for hours, even if other people come over, in <br/>
boxers and t-shirt.<br/>
<br/>
Marty likes long flannel pajama pants, with pockets.  He wears jockey shorts, <br/>
but sleeps in those flannel pants, with or without a t-shirt, depending on <br/>
the season.  Then he wears the pants until he&#39;s going to go somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is a fashion queen of some sort, and owns pajamas and gowns, but often <br/>
sleeps in an oversized t-shirt, someone else&#39;s old favorite which she happily <br/>
claims for a nightshirt.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom used to make the boys flannel pajamas when they were toddlers.  <br/>
Nice ones that pulled over.  The boys liked them okay, but Holly LOVED the <br/>
hand-me-downs.  Her grandmother didn&#39;t like Holly liking those, so she would <br/>
make her girls&#39; pajamas, with lace (itchy) and buttons (irritating) which <br/>
Holly never liked.<br/>
<br/>
So we have failed, in the eyes of my in-laws, to pajama-train our children.<br/>
I figure they wear more pajama-like stuff (two of them, anyway) than their <br/>
parents do.<br/>

her mind it had something to do with teaching discipline, how would he <br/>
learn to do things that he has to do yadda yadda yadda. My mom is really big<br/>
on &quot;nipping problems in the bud&quot; where I tend to assume that he is a good kid<br/>
and try not to worry about things too much. So far it has worked...when Jason <br/>
was 9 months old, my mom told me that I needed to teach him how to wait when <br/>
I was doing things (like letting him cry while I did the dishes instead of putting<br/>
the dishes off till later). It has been nice to see that as he got older he has<br/>
gotten better at waiting and I did not need to cry for him to learn that...<br/>

<br/>
Since he learned it with or without the &quot;teaching,&quot; it was best for both of <br/>
you that the negative aspects of the teaching were bypassed.  Every moment he <br/>
would have spent crying was spent doing something better!<br/>
<br/>
So if it works for &quot;learning to wait,&quot; <br/>
and for learning to read,<br/>
I&#39;m betting a big chunk of my life that it will work for all kinds of other <br/>
things too!<br/>

So we have failed, in the eyes of my in-laws, to pajama-train our children.<br/>
I figure they wear more pajama-like stuff (two of them, anyway) than their<br/>
parents do.<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As babies and toddlers and forward Brit and Mikey went to bed in whatever<br/>
they were wearing at the time, as long as it looked comfortable (if not,<br/>
something comfortable, from a onesie on up to t-shirts as they got older,<br/>
was put on instead).<br/>
<br/>
Then they came to me, I think about 18 months or so ago (maybe a little<br/>
longer) and said, &quot;Can we buy some pajamas?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So we bought some, and I alerted the relatives and they got more for their<br/>
birthdays or Christmas, and for quite awhile (like, months) after that they<br/>
would carefully change out of their clothes and into their pajamas nearly<br/>
every night after a bath or when it started getting late. You&#39;d have<br/>
mistaken them for English butlers, they were so proper. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now they wear them sometimes as the whim strikes them, and sometimes go to<br/>
bed in whatever they happen to be wearing when they get tired.<br/>

When Kirby was very little, one or two, he said if we went to Disneyland he <br/>
wanted to get a SIDar.  I couldn&#39;t get any clearer on this thing he really <br/>
wanted.  He was acting it out with his hands and I thought it was something <br/>
to eat, maybe, and was guessing like crazy.  He said, &quot;YOU KNOW. Like <br/>
Pinocchio.&quot;  A puppet?  A hat?  <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking and thinking.  Nothing&#39;s coming to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Then one day the movie was on and he led me over to it and pointed.  <br/>
<br/>
CIGAR.<br/>
<br/>
In the part where the boys have gone bad, they have cigars, and Kirby wanted <br/>
one too. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finally we DID go to Disneyland, and they don&#39;t even sell cigars.   Another <br/>
marketting opportunity lost...   So we bought a little bottle of water for $2 <br/>
to drown our sorrows.<br/>
