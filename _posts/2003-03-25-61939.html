<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827708107">I am a lurker but just had to pop in and share my favorite way to keep a 3 y/o<br/>
occupied and happy while Mom is sick.  Have her rub lotion on your legs, arms,<br/>
back and hands.  A child that age usually loves the tactile aspect of it and it<br/>
feels good for Mom, too. &lt;g&gt;  You can even let her draw pictures with the<br/>
lotion on your back while you try to guess what she is drawing.  It is best if<br/>
you have lotion in a pump type bottle and keep a towel handy.  <br/>

What a great idea!!!<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I have played a game where we draw a picture on the other&#39;s back <br/>
with a finger.  Just something simple.  The other person guesses what it is.  <br/>
We should have added lotion!!<br/>
<br/>
Next time.  Thanks!<br/>
