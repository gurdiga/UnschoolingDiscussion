<div id="ygrps-yiv-645549086">&lt;&lt;I think what stresses me the most is when I see these families in their <br/>
SUV&#39;s<br/>
or not counting what is in their cart at the store. I know the grass looks<br/>
greener on the other side and no I dont want to be them but it all does way<br/>
heavy on my heart.&gt;&gt;<br/>

It IS hard.  We spent the first seven years of marriage dirt poor.  Lost our <br/>
first house to foreclosure and often wondered where our next meal was coming <br/>
from.  We were renting a house with a terrible landlord and spent three <br/>
months in a sewage backup, not having the money to hire an attorney to get <br/>
us out.  We had a four bedroom home and could only use one room.  About that <br/>
time, my mom lost her job and didn&#39;t want to lose her house, so we moved in <br/>
and took over payments, which she didn&#39;t send in and now we are in HER <br/>
foreclosure.<br/>
<br/>
My husband fell into an high paying job and I really thought things would <br/>
turn around for us.  I wasn&#39;t really worried about getting forced out of <br/>
this house because we now have the money to buy any house we want, well <br/>
cover the payments, lol.  Problem is, we can&#39;t get anyone to look at us <br/>
because of our credit.  Renting/leasing looks even worse.  They see our <br/>
foreclosure and dumped lease house and won&#39;t even consider us, even with a <br/>
sizeable downpayment/security deposit.<br/>
<br/>
The other side of the coin is that my husband is NEVER home.  Chloe is 7.5 <br/>
months old and Chis has been home a collective 2 months of that time.  I&#39;m <br/>
thankful we don&#39;t have the financial struggles but the price is too high.  <br/>
When he&#39;s home, Caeleb and Chloe take a few days to warm up to him.  I <br/>
really believe they don&#39;t recognize him when he gets back from trips.  Just <br/>
when they warm up to him again, he&#39;s gone on another trip.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>
about him finding another job where he can be home more but he can&#39;t find <br/>
anything in the middle.  It&#39;s either this job or something that won&#39;t cover <br/>
the bills, much less food.<br/>
<br/>
Ironic that you should mention te grocery store outing.  The last time I <br/>
went grocery shopping, I was standing behind a family of four.  Mom, Dad, <br/>
and two girls.  They were sifting through their coupons and the mom was <br/>
adding everything up on the calculator, hoping (aloud) that they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to put anything back.  Dad was playing with the baby who was smiling <br/>
and cooing at him and the older girl was riding piggyback laughing over his <br/>
shoulder.  Here I was, the person NOT paying attention to what was in the <br/>
cart, wishing like hell I had to count coupons because it would mean my <br/>
husband would be there, helping me with the kids, playing with our babies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a double edged sword and it cuts no matter where you touch it.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could all just fall in the middle?  I long to live <br/>
in a cooperative community.  Commune??  Where everyone shares the load, <br/>
barters for what they need and all the families live happily.  Is there even <br/>
such a place?<br/>

Hi, Jen,There are some wonderful sites on intentional living communities. I found several through the Wondertree site in BC. Just punch the above description into your google engine and you should find some wonderful support for communal living. The trick, I think, is to find like minded folk near enough that it will work. Also, look for books on simplifying like Extreme simplicity or choosing simplicity. They also talk about communities.Cheers, Joan<br/>

idea, but<br/>
at the speed I bike with the kids, I&#39;d have to leave tomorrow.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the laugh!  I was thinking I would have had to leave last August! <br/>
