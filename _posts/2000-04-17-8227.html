You talk of patience:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hafidha wrote (very patiently I thought): &quot;By lazy I mean the inclination to<br/>
&gt; be inert.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one needs a definition of lazy, I have never seen a better one! This made<br/>
&gt; me laugh out loud!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think &#39;patiently&#39; refers better to the parent who allows his / her child the<br/>
space to come to activity on their own. I have never seen an unschooled child<br/>
(and rarely a schooled child) who has an &#39;inclination to be inert&#39;. This<br/>
description would only apply to a child who had had all initiative beaten out of<br/>
them (literally or figuratively) by adults. Non-action is not necessarily<br/>
inertness or laziness. Some people are thinkers, and some take a lot longer to<br/>
get through thinking. I don&#39;t believe it is possible to know what is happenning<br/>
inside someone else&#39;s head. You ask a kid &#39;what are you thinking about?&#39; and<br/>
s/he answers &#39;nothing&#39;, you may think s/he is being lazy or inert, I would<br/>
assume that they didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, a &#39;bored&#39; child left alone to be bored (still talk to them but<br/>
don&#39;t nag), trusted to come through, will eventually burst forth in activity and<br/>
creativity, often into a totally new interest.<br/>
<br/>
IMO it is, yet again, a matter of trusting our children - and being able to keep<br/>
trusting, sometimes for a looong time.<br/>
