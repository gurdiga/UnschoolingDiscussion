<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417441795">Hi.<br/>
I can&#39;t remember who posted they had just had a miscarriage<br/>
(accidentally pressed delete) at 11 wks.<br/>
I am so sorry to hear that,  it must be a very hard time for you. :o(<br/>
 I would like to reply to the question about the relation to that and<br/>
your immune system.<br/>
First, if you have an auto immune disease never take echinacea. It can<br/>
cause havoc in  people with auti-immune problems. IMO I would start with<br/>
your diet, cutting out anything that is rubbish and sticking to the good<br/>
stuff. Garlic of course can help with resistance to colds etc. You can<br/>
also get good prenatal vitamins to build your system up.<br/>
I am just off to a kinesiologist who does muscle testing to find out if<br/>
I&#39;m allergic to any food, she also can tell what is good for your<br/>
particular condition, so that might be an option for you.<br/>
Because I have deleted your post I can&#39;t remember the exact wording of<br/>
your question so I  haven&#39;t even begun to answer it properly. But I hope<br/>
the little I&#39;ve said has helped even slightly.<br/>
Hang in there and don&#39;t give up. I know losing a baby is so hard. I<br/>
personally haven&#39;t had a miscarriage even tho I have rheumatoid<br/>
arthritis, but we lost our son when he was 14mths old, so I kind of know<br/>
what its like.<br/>
<br/>
There....I probably don&#39;t make any sense, I tend to be very vague at<br/>
times!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524960963">hi,<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your response and your advise.  i&#39;m going to try acupuncture<br/>
with a woman who has worked with other women with autoimmune diseases<br/>
trying to keep pregnancies.   miscarrying (especially when you already have<br/>
one child) is sad but not in comparison with losing a 14 month old baby.<br/>
i&#39;m so sorry and honestly can&#39;t image what that must feel like.<br/>
<br/>
i am curious as to when was the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.  i have<br/>
still&#39;s disease and onset was after rene&#39; was born - he was 20 months old<br/>
and i was on the way to 38.  this is my second miscarriage - the first i<br/>
believe was due to a hormonal imbalance ( i had no morning sickness or<br/>
other normal, for me, symptoms) and was at around 8 weeks and only 6 months<br/>
after onset of still&#39;s.  this time i had all the expected symptom i.e. the<br/>
same as i had with rene&#39; so i was surprised when i miscarried.  we hope to<br/>
try again in a few months and feel good about the possibility of it<br/>
happening.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been taking this product (i&#39;ve tried many different ones) by prohealth<br/>
solutions containing homeostatic soil organisms which is a beneficial<br/>
bacteria that cleans out the detrimental bacteria allowing the intestines<br/>
to function better;  and photochemical sterol and sterolins which balance<br/>
immune function (unlike echinacea which only stimulates it).  it is not<br/>
fast acting but within 6 months of taking it i felt better than i have<br/>
since the onset.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
