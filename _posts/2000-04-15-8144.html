  <div><br></div><tt>amy,<br>maybe you and some others with an understanding of 
  chiro can help me see what <br>the justification for birth being so traumatic 
  is?&nbsp; how can something so <br>natural by design cause such havoc on the 
  system?&nbsp; what did people do before <br>chiropractic?&nbsp; i have heard 
  this before but it has never made sense to me and <br>i am willing to 
  listen...&nbsp; also, why the continual adjustments?&nbsp; what do we <br>keep 
  doing to ourselves in the course of our days where we&#39;d need to keep <br>going 
  and going to keep getting adjusted?&nbsp; i guess the thought of being so 
  <br>dependent is unappealing, too.<br>erin<br></tt>

Thanks so MUCH<br>
I was so terrified of the chiro and I hated that popping as well (ok
really I thought my neck was going to break apart!)<br>
Thank you thank you<br>
I was considering massage therapy cause my neck has been bothering me to
no end<br>
and NOW I have my answer<br>
thanks!!<br>
