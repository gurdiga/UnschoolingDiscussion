What about the Kids!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No need to worry here~~~NCL has it covered.  With dozens of fun activities <br/>
to choose from, kids will delight in everything the Kids Programs onboard <br/>
have to offer!!<br/>
What does it offer?<br/>
The &quot;Kid’s Crew&quot; program includes a plethora of supervised games, T-shirts <br/>
for design painting, and a Mom and Dad’s Night Out. Children receive their <br/>
own Cruise News detailing daily events. A complimentary chef’s hat, also <br/>
included in the program, is essential for creative cooking classes where <br/>
children can make decorative pizzas or cookies. NCL’s autograph/scrapbooks <br/>
make perfect mementos of the kids’ experiences and friendships. Junior <br/>
cruisers can even celebrate their birthdays on the high seas with NCL’s <br/>
special &quot;Kid’s Crew&quot; birthday parties.<br/>
<br/>
An exceptionally qualified staff of trained counselors run NCL’s &quot;Kid’s <br/>
Crew&quot; program in a safe and secure environment. The staff attends special <br/>
training courses on team and confidence building, communication skills, <br/>
safety, and working with children who have special needs. The fleetwide <br/>
program is available year-round and is free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Visit Exotic Ports of Call!!<br/>
    Roatan, Bay Islands You&#39;ll receive a welcome as warm as the weather in <br/>
this <br/>
rustic, banana-shaped idyll of brilliant blue water, palm-fringed beaches <br/>
and cooling trade winds. One of three Bay Islands just off the coast of <br/>
Honduras, Roatan is home to a mix of eight different cultures who share a <br/>
common pride in their homeland. Just off shore, the pristine Belizean <br/>
Reef—teeming with marine life and some of the best pillar coral in the <br/>
Caribbean—is considered one of the best dive destinations in the world.<br/>
<br/>
    George Town, Grand Cayman Once a pirate stronghold and haven for <br/>
deserters <br/>
from Oliver Cromwell&#39;s army, British Grand Cayman today is charming, <br/>
prosperous and utterly civilized. Even though the famous Seven-Mile Beach is <br/>
actually closer to six miles long, every inch of its golden sand is a treat. <br/>
In addition to duty-free shops filled with fine English porcelain and <br/>
crystal, the marvelous marine park system alone makes a visit here <br/>
worthwhile. The Cayman Islands boast some of the wreck diving in the world.<br/>
<br/>
    Cozumel, Mexico The beaches, dining and shopping are great on this tiny <br/>
tropical isle just 12 miles off Mexico&#39;s coast. But it&#39;s the coral reef just <br/>
off shore and the sacred Maya ruins that are the primary attractions. <br/>
Palm-lined beaches throb with activity, while a dense jungle interior <br/>
showcases Cozumel&#39;s primeval side. Spectacular Palancar Reef, part of the <br/>
second longest coral reef system in the world, beckons divers the world <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
Optional Shore Excursions Available At Each Port!<br/>
    Discover the Sugar and Spice of the Islands Whether your Caribbean <br/>
vacation <br/>
is a quick getaway or a romantic two-week tour of the islands, you won&#39;t <br/>
want to miss some of the hidden treasures on our exclusive Shore Excursions. <br/>
They can bring you to the depths of the ocean in an Atlantis submarine or to <br/>
the top of mountains to view ancient ruins and spectacular vistas. NCL has <br/>
organized many exciting Shore Excursions for you to get the most out of your <br/>
Caribbean cruise.<br/>

<br/>
Special Note for Larger Families of 5 or more!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your family has more than 4 guests, you will require two staterooms for <br/>
this sailing! The most economical way to travel is by booking two side by <br/>
side or connecting cabins for your entire party. Many families on other <br/>
sailings have opted to invite grandparents along to stay in the second <br/>
cabin. Please be advised of this issue so that if you have more than 4 in <br/>
your family you can plan accordingly!<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you have 5 in your party, you will need a cabin for 3 and a <br/>
cabin for 2.  If you have 6 in your party you can split it into two cabins <br/>
for 3 people, or put 2 in one cabin and 4 in the second one.<br/>
<br/>
The maximum occupancy they will allow in the inside and/or oceanview cabins <br/>
is 4!!<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Is the Little Rock group all going?  Please review the plan again.<br/>
<br/>
I forwarded this to Keith, reminding him that Kirby&#39;s still willing to do <br/>
things with the family, but will soon be up and out (being 17 now), and that <br/>
maybe we could drive to Houston, as by May Marty should have a learner&#39;s permit <br/>
and Kirby have a whole license.<br/>
<br/>
We have five so we would have to get two rooms, but MAYBE if another family <br/>
of five is in the same predicament, we could split a second room and have a kid <br/>
or two of theirs share with a kid or two of ours?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to think about it without mentioning it to the kids.  It&#39;s a kind <br/>
of sudden investment situation.  But to be with other unschooling whole <br/>
families for that long is a huge temptation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty much open to anyone.  I don&#39;t believe a huge number of people <br/>
from Little Rock will be going, probably 3-4 families that I can think of that <br/>
would be able to afford it and be willing.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s pretty sudden for us, but we&#39;re going to use the payment plan.  I <br/>
think the fact that it leaves from Houston (but don&#39;t you have to drive to the <br/>
ocean from Houston?) makes it better for us.  We can drive it, too.  Although, <br/>
we can fly cheap out of Little Rock to Houston on Southwest, so that may be <br/>
an option as well.<br/>

From the description, it wasn&#39;t really clear that this is a cruise just for<br/>
unschoolers.  Is this really so??  It really did look like most any cruise<br/>
open to anyone (except, of course, that schoolers are usually in school ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It would be such a blast to be on a cruise with so many unschooling families!<br/>
<br/>
