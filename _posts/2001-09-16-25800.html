&gt; I didn&#39;t say your thoughts weren&#39;t welcome here.  I asked what you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>were <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hoping to gain being here.  That&#39;s not the same thing.  And I didn&#39;t <br/>
 </span></blockquote>really <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get an answer, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, then I guess the archives added this to message #25013:<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
And if the information here is diluted or polluted by non-unschooling<br/>
advice <br/>
in sufficient measure, then people will still not see unschooling.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I have answered the question of why I am here repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Can we talk about unschooling now instead of the list itself please?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to, unfortunately every comment I make is warped and turned<br/>
around by you or one or two others to say what you think I mean instead<br/>
of what it actually says. <br/>

I&#39;m reminded of an interchange between Lady Astor and Winston Churchill:<br/>
Lady Astor said: Winston, if you were my husband, I&#39;d poison your tea, to<br/>

<br/>
I was neither the first nor only to suggest you seemed not to be reading what <br/>
others write.<br/>
<br/>
Being on a large discussion list shouldn&#39;t need to involve &quot;getting along,&quot; <br/>
only making points which one can defend, and sharing personal experience.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve defended my points and shared my personal experiences.  I don&#39;t see that <br/>
an artificial limitation on how I should continue to do that would be <br/>
beneficial to new homeschoolers who come here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to ignore your posts if that will make you feel better, though.  I&#39;m <br/>
not willing to compromise my beliefs for another person&#39;s comfort and so I <br/>
can&#39;t make promises that might cause me to do that.<br/>
