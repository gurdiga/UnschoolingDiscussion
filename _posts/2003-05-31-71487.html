<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849872211">Oh I&#39;ve heard that one, many many times...not so much recently, but 15 years ago when I had my son.<br/>
<br/>
Breastfeeding was just then becoming more popular but all the old myths still abounded.  At least that was my experience.<br/>
<br/>
And before that, when I was in nursing school it was very much implied that bottle feeding was better even though they *said* breastfeeding was a good thing.<br/>

  I dont&#39; know anymore.  It was so long ago.  I only remember the &quot;impressions&quot; I got while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
  I think it was just the overarching belief at the time...kind of like &quot;school is best for kids&quot; now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867210957">this is a funny thing though, because I was shocked the other day when I went to pump and it had been several weeks since I last pumped ( I dont really need to pump too much because I am usually with my baby) and I pumped soooo much milk! I called my dh over and said, &quot;honey, look at this!&quot;  I couldnt believe it, my body is so amazing to know that now my baby is bigger so now I need to produce more:) I just love nursing little Nora and will continue to for some time:) Good night!

<br/>
So the doctor can fill out a chart.  So she knows when to STOP feeding him.  <br/>
So he&#39;s getting enough.  So she can measure output against input, to be <br/>
SCIENTIFIC.<br/>
<br/>
The same reason children should be tested every year.  So we know they&#39;re <br/>
learning.<br/>
We measure input, we measure output...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re probably too young to remember the Dupont &#39;50&#39;s catch phrase &quot;Better<br/>
Things for Better Living Through Chemistry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was just sort of the feeling in society: that there wasn&#39;t anything<br/>
that man couldn&#39;t improve on. At the time man *was* doing better than nature<br/>
in so many ways. (The side effects of &quot;doing better&quot; wouldn&#39;t show up until<br/>
later. But there was no way for them to know what was coming.) The US went<br/>
from the dust bowl to *huge* increases in crop production in just a couple<br/>
of decades. The polio vaccine eliminated the specter of the iron lung and<br/>
leg braces. And that&#39;s just the tip of so many improvements that happened<br/>
during that era.<br/>
<br/>
It was recognized that if we quantifed things we could improve them. So,<br/>
extrapolating from that, the thinking became that anything that could be<br/>
quantified was superior to anything that couldn&#39;t be quantified.<br/>
<br/>
That thinking is still with us and is especially notable in anything to do<br/>
with raising kids: food, discipline, school.<br/>

I have to admit I did worry about it, especially with my preemie.<br/>
<br/>
I think at some point all mothers might wonder if their babies are getting <br/>
enough.  My fourth was the hardest for me so I can understand why some mothers <br/>
give up, if I had not already nursed three successfully, I might have given up <br/>
at some point.  It was very hard for the first three months.<br/>
