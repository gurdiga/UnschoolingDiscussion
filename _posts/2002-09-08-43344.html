<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ~Nancy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re wrong about that--I&#39;ve been involved in very <br/>
conservative, evangelical circles and have always been taught that <br/>
sex for pleasure is good as long as it is between two married <br/>
people.  That is what I believe the Bible to say.  It says not to <br/>
deprive each other unless you need a time of fasting and prayer.  <br/>
Since there is only one time a month that you can conceive, sex <br/>
simply for procreation would be unbiblical.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what Kama Sutra is...I guess I&#39;ll go do a google <br/>
search.<br/>

<br/>
Nobody knew about the once a month time (which is not one moment or one day a <br/>
month, anyway) in Bible-writing or even Bible-translating times.  So it would <br/>
be unbiological, but not &quot;unbiblical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the tradition of not having fun during sex is not just Catholic based, <br/>
but early-protestant based.  &quot;Missionary position&quot; did NOT refer to Catholic <br/>
missionaries!!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Someone else mentioned that it would be construed as bad because it was from <br/>
India.  This baffles me....I thought that if you were Christian, it was wrong <br/>
to worship with other religions but ok to incorporate things about other <br/>
CULTURES into your life. ??<br/>
Am I wrong?<br/>
Kama Sutra is a bit outdated in it&#39;s original form. Creative positions to be <br/>
sure, very open about sex but not as respectful to the woman as what is <br/>
culturally acceptable today.<br/>
BUT, the line of products bearing the Kama Sutra name are incredible.<br/>
They are classy, high quality, intimacy products. I beleive they will enhance <br/>
anyone&#39;s sex life.<br/>
The game is very, very erotic...slow paced and brings you much closer to your <br/>
partner by communicating desires and so on.<br/>
So I&#39;m sorry for the person here that would never think of having any Kama <br/>
Sutra in their house......it&#39;s actually a rather beautiful way to promote <br/>
closeness with your spouse.<br/>

<br/>
How can you separate the religious beliefs of a culture from their sexual <br/>
practices?  <br/>
<br/>
(I mean how can you do that if you&#39;re a Bible-thumping, fearful Christian?)<br/>
<br/>
The Kama Sutra discusses arranged marriages, and pairings by size of PARTS, <br/>
and if that isn&#39;t against the laws of God... well...  <br/>
<br/>
The text is online if anyone&#39;s curious.<br/>

<br/>
I am wondering what &quot;Hindu practice&quot; you think it&#39;s based on. It&#39;s a line of <br/>
products, the only thing related to the original Kama Sutra are a few of the <br/>
positions. Which are very creative, and not something most people would just <br/>
think up. (someone did, somewhere, but they are more creative than I!!)<br/>
People can have great sex lives, but I do think that games and books and such <br/>
can really enhance it. Sex is not openly discussed in most families, not as <br/>
to what pleasures the partner and such.<br/>
Did your parents teach you that?<br/>
That&#39;s why the books and games can enhance so much, if you&#39;re open to <br/>
learning.<br/>

Because it has nothing to do with the religion....some Christians would like <br/>

&lt;&lt;    Whether or not your Karma Sutra game does that, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
 I just assumed it was more of a *kinky* game not for Christians.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the problem when one assumes. As one of my teachers said &quot;assume means <br/>
making an ass out of u and me&quot; LOL<br/>
I suppose it depends on your definition of kinky.<br/>
I think it&#39;s an incredibly sensual game....very into communication, tender <br/>
touching and helps couple be not only creative, but more in touch with each <br/>
others feelings.<br/>
It&#39;s classy in my view, but you have to be very comfortable with your bodies <br/>
and talking openly about what you like.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to say it is a parents place to teach how to pleasure your <br/>
partner, I was trying to make the point that that is where books and games <br/>
can be important aids in the process.<br/>
