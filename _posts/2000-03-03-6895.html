I have the same situation with a support group here.  They gear everything <br/>
towards the older children.  Needless to say I never go to anything, because <br/>
I don&#39;t fit! All of my friends are gearing up for preschool next year two <br/>
days a week. Gee, that will leave possibly 3 days that we (and our children) <br/>
might have a chance to connect with each other.  I sometimes wonder if these <br/>
same friends will continue to be my friend say 5 years down the road.  A few <br/>
I know will, but I wonder about the others.  They seem just a little too <br/>
excited about the prospect of shopping, lunching, volunteering, etc. while <br/>
their children are in preschool. They &quot;can&#39;t wait until preschool starts&quot;!! <br/>
Ugh!  How can anyone want to be away from their child that much?  Yes, I <br/>
know there are those days...but every week?<br/>

&gt;Yes--not having anyone who can relate to what you want to do IS such a<br/>
&gt;difficulty...<br/>
&gt;EVERYONE here sends their kids to school, and I have yet to find a support<br/>
&gt;group in my area....most of the people I find out about are a good 1 hr<br/>
&gt;away..kind of hard to cultivate a relationship with a stranger that way...<br/>
&gt;There is a group that  does activities ect, but everything is for the older<br/>
&gt;ages...nothing for little ones really..<br/>
&gt;So this list is my support group...although not much interaction for my<br/>
&gt;child...<br/>
&gt;Altleast we have each other !!!  Just knowing that I&#39;m not alone in my<br/>
&gt;feelings certainly does ALOT for me...<br/>
