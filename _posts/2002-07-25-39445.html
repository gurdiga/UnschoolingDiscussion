<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858550485">This is a part of a book review - from a new online emagazine called &quot;What&#39;s <br/>
Your Creativity Quotient (C.Q)?&quot;.  I&#39;ll copy that here, too, but mostly I <br/>
wanted to mention this book since it might be something that new unschoolers <br/>
would enjoy. I haven&#39;t looked at it - just basing that on what I see here. <br/>
The newsletter is more aimed at teachers - but these are people involved with <br/>
Destination Imagination and I was struck at our regional tournament by how <br/>
very very respectful of children these people were - many ARE teachers, and <br/>
it must be the real cream of the crop who do this program in their spare <br/>
time.<br/>

Book Summary: &quot;Playful Parenting is a guide to having more fun with young <br/>
people of all ages, as they tackle new accomplishments, or recover from being <br/>
hurt, or simply when they are bursting with youthful exuberance. Through <br/>
Playful Parenting--joining children in their world, focusing on connection <br/>
and confidence, giggling and roughhousing, reversing the roles and following <br/>
your child&#39;s lead--<br/>
you will learn how to help them through their emotional blocks, handle their <br/>
strong emotions (and your own), deal effectively with sibling rivalry and <br/>
other tricky problems, and rethink your ideas about discipline and punishment…<br/>
written with love and humor, brimming with good advice and revealing <br/>
anecdotes, and grounded in the latest research, Playful Parenting will make <br/>
you laugh even as it makes you wise in the ways of being a happy, effective, <br/>
enthusiastic parent.&quot;<br/>

1. &quot;World Class Programs&quot; offers six steps for developing creative solutions <br/>
to<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In today&#39;s complex world the most important thing you can do for your child <br/>
is to teach him or her how to think.&quot; –Edward de Bono<br/>
<br/>
Creative Problem Solving (CPS) allows for the use of divergent and convergent <br/>
thinking in order to develop creative solutions to problems. Six steps are <br/>
listed and explained. (Included are great focusing questions, extending <br/>
questions, clarifying questions, etc.) &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldclassprograms.com.au/concepts.htm&quot;">http://www.worldclassprograms.com.au/concepts.htm&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>

3. Book Review: &quot;Playful Parenting: A Bold New Way to Nurture Close<br/>
Connections, Solve Behavior Problems, and Encourage Children&#39;s Confidence&quot; <br/>
written by Lawrence J. Cohen, PhD (FMB)<br/>
<br/>
I had the pleasure of meeting the book&#39;s author at this year&#39;s National <br/>
Association of Independent Schools Conference in San Francisco, California. I <br/>
really like the message in this book. There are also many practical ideas and <br/>
easy to follow instructions to help you deal effectively with children, at <br/>
THEIR level. I have personally used many of the techniques in the book with <br/>
my own child (as well as other children and even a few adults). If you want <br/>
to lecture/discipline a little less and laugh/play a whole lot more, I would <br/>
encourage you to get this book! <br/>
<br/>
Book Summary: &quot;Playful Parenting is a guide to having more fun with young <br/>
people of all ages, as they tackle new accomplishments, or recover from being <br/>
hurt, or simply when they are bursting with youthful exuberance. Through <br/>
Playful Parenting--joining children in their world, focusing on connection <br/>
and confidence, giggling and roughhousing, reversing the roles and following <br/>
your child&#39;s lead--<br/>

4. Get more out of your creative time with these craft tips from <br/>
&quot;i-craft.com&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The less time you spend correcting mistakes or fussing with set-up and <br/>
clean-up, the more pleasure you get!&quot; www.i-craft.com has some great &quot;craft&quot; <br/>
ideas and tips for working with children. Here are just a few:<br/>
<br/>
· Remember this adage: clean hands, clean project.<br/>
· Use plastic party table covers for messy crafts. They protect better than <br/>
newspaper and can be used more than once.<br/>
· When working with cardboard and glue, lightly wet the underside of the <br/>
cardboard and it will dry flat.<br/>
· Prevent paper from ripping when affixing tape by applying the tape to <br/>
clothing first to reduce its stickiness.<br/>
· Cut Styrofoam® by using a serrated knife well waxed with a candle stub or <br/>
paraffin.<br/>
· Heat from a blow drier causes strings of hot glue to disintegrate <br/>
immediately.<br/>
· When doing decoupage, use rounded lacquered chopsticks to smooth out any <br/>
air bubbles or wrinkles after gluing. You can usually find lacquered <br/>
chopsticks (which are smoother than un-lacquered sticks) in Asian markets or <br/>
gift shops. <br/>
· To keep the pattern stationary, have children place a rolled piece of <br/>
masking tape between the pattern and the surface to be cut. Cut around <br/>
pattern and surface simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
While at &quot;i-craft.com&quot; also check out the &quot;Teacher Place&quot; where you&#39;ll find <br/>
<br/>
· Creative lesson plans that incorporate crafts with core curriculum <br/>
subjects. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&quot;">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&lt;/A">http://www.i-craft.com/teachers/plans00/index.html&lt;/A</a>&gt;   · Making the <br/>

<br/>
6. A Lesson in Creativity: PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD! (FMB)<br/>
<br/>
Mealtime can provide a great learning opportunity for a child. Consider one <br/>
of these ideas: <br/>
<br/>
· Practice making geometric shapes out of cheese cubes and pretzel sticks. <br/>
Try making cubes, pyramids or other geometric shapes. For more fun, try <br/>
making a watchtower for a pretzel pirate or a footbridge between two cups.<br/>
· Create mosaic tile designs out of graham crackers (base), peanut butter <br/>
(grout), and trail mix, candies or mini-marshmallows (tiles). Sort tiles by <br/>
size, color, and shape before creating a design. <br/>
· Create a modern art sculpture using slices of fruit and/or veggies. Use <br/>
toothpicks or skewers (be careful!) to connect pieces together.<br/>
· Build a sand castle out of pancakes. Use cookie cutters or a butter knife <br/>
to cut basic shapes. (Add a moat for maple syrup!)<br/>
· Draw a picture or write your name with cooked spaghetti. When project is <br/>
completed, cover with marinara and dive in. (Don&#39;t forget to slurp!)<br/>
· Make your own ice cream flavors. Allow vanilla ice cream to soften slightly <br/>
and divide small portions into disposable bowls. Add a flavor to each bowl <br/>
(such as candies, cookies, peanut butter, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, <br/>
strawberries, mashed banana, etc.) and refreeze. Play ice cream parlor (role <br/>
playing) or conduct a taste test (evaluation and comparison) by defining <br/>
criteria, creating a <br/>
survey form, and comparing all flavors to pick the best one.<br/>
