I am a devoted vegetarian also, who started making natural herbal soaps several years ago.  I began by reading and using the recipes in The Soap Book by Sandy Maine.  This was her first book on soapmaking but I believe she has several others now.  All the recipes in this book are vegetarian (meaning they don&#39;t use tallow or lard) and are scented using herbal essential oils (which is by far the most expensive ingredient).  She also has a website with loads of information and links to natural soapmaking at www.sunsoap.com .  Though I&#39;ve read that soapmaking can be tricky, I&#39;ve found these recipes simple, easy to follow and haven&#39;t had any failures, yet.  Hope this helps.  <br/>
