<div id="ygrps-yiv-957920438">&quot;If you have a less general definition of unschooling<br/>
than &quot;living real life&quot;, I&#39;d like to know it.-=-&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, teachers are &quot;living real life&quot;, but they aren&#39;t usually helping<br/>
people unschool. Kids in school against their choice are &quot;living real<br/>
life&quot; but they aren&#39;t getting much help with pursuing the things that<br/>
matter most to them, nor are they free to choose their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean &quot;is unschooling more than living real life&quot; then I say YES.<br/>
It&#39;s living a life of freedom. Freedom to choose what  you learn, when<br/>
you learn it and how you learn it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59099489">On one side of my screen, I&#39;m reading e-mail and working on my website.<br/>
On the other side, I&#39;m watching TNG episodes in order.<br/>
<br/>
The episode called &quot;Offspring&quot; in which Data creates an android  <br/>
daughter is on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lal to Data:  Why do you still try to emulate humans?  What purpose  <br/>
does it serveâ€¦?<br/>
<br/>
Data: I have asked myself that many times as I have struggled to be  <br/>
more human.<br/>
until I realized that it is the struggle itself that is most important.<br/>
We must strive to be more than we are, Lal.<br/>
It does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal.<br/>
The effort yields its own rewards<br/>
<br/>
Lal:  You are wise, father.<br/>
<br/>
Data:  It is the difference between knowledge and experience.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of the conversation on babies and unschooling.<br/>
