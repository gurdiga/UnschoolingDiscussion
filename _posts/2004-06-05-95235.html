<div id="ygrps-yiv-258864673">Hi Unschoolers.  I know I dropped off the face of the earth.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been reading every message that comes through, but couldn&#39;t reply <br/>
via my HLSelden@comcast address.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of changes are going on right now.  <br/>
<br/>
The long and short of it is, I came out of the closet, I am getting <br/>
a divorce and I currently have custody of 2 of the 3 kids.  <br/>
<br/>
This was not an easy decision, but in the long run, I feel it&#39;s best <br/>
for all of us.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to stop the posts from coming to that inbox for now as I <br/>
only check it once a week.  <br/>
<br/>
When things settle down, perhaps I&#39;ll return to regular posting.  In <br/>
the meantime, the kids are doing well and my roomates are both very <br/>
supportive of Unschooling.  They have two children with a &quot;One in a <br/>
million&quot; genetic skin disorder who have teachers come in 3 times a <br/>
week.  So we&#39;re thinking of getting them on the unschooling <br/>
bandwagon and out of the &quot;schoolish&quot; mode.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you are all well and hope to see you again soon.<br/>
<br/>
Holly</div>
