<div id="ygrps-yiv-709775672">My name is Jill, I have four kids (7yo boy, 5 1/2yo girl, <br/>
2 1/2yo boy and 2mos boy).  When the older two were babies, the <br/>
thought of school never sat well with me.  I looked into <br/>
homeschooling and thought that would be the path we would take <br/>
(without the support of my family, of course).  Then I found out <br/>
about a Charter School, without going into detail, it sounded good <br/>
to me at that point.  We got in (they hold a lottery) and right now, <br/>
my oldest two kids are enrolled there (1st grade and K).  It&#39;s not <br/>
what I thought it would be.  (Surprise, surprise!)  They have an <br/>
open door policy, encourage parent participation as much as possible <br/>
and emphasize community, especially in the school.  Grades are mixed <br/>
and they profess hands on activities.  It is better than a public <br/>
school.  But not good enough.  I guess I fooled myself into thinking <br/>
the school would be able to teach my kids better than them learning <br/>
on their own.  I have two other kids now, that makes it impossible <br/>
for me to be as involved as I want to be.  We&#39;ve been planning on <br/>
hsing for high school because the school only goes up to 8th grade, <br/>
so the kids are familiar with the idea of it.  They ask how much <br/>
longer (until they can hs).  They tell me they like school, but <br/>
would rather stay home.  I dread getting up mornings, we yell and <br/>
get a rather harsh start just about every day (my dd has tactile <br/>
issues and getting dressed is a fiasco, especially under <br/>
pressure!).  I love the idea of unschooling, it just fits so well <br/>
with my relaxed attitude :)  (Although my mother calls it <br/>
irresponsible...)  The kids do enjoy going to school, so I think we <br/>
are going to finish up the year and just not go back next year.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to the freedom, all aspects of it.  Unschooling <br/>
will allow us to live &quot;our&quot; way.  I&#39;m looking forward to the kids <br/>
knowing their own limits, eating and sleeping for example.  I&#39;m <br/>
concerned about bedtimes though, and how that will work.  I want <br/>
them to go to bed when they need to, but with 4 small kids, after <br/>
they are in bed is the only alone time I get with my husband.  Can <br/>
anyone offer suggestions on how to have the unwinding time (as much <br/>
as I love hanging out with my kids, I look forward to my quiet time <br/>
every night).  Would it squelch their ability to distinguish when <br/>
they are tired if we designate quiet time after a certain hour?   <br/>
<br/>
Whew, that was longer than I thought it would be!  Thanks for <br/>
reading.  I&#39;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts :)  <br/>

<br/>
How about just not go to school when your kids don&#39;t want to go... let them<br/>
stay home when they want to, and go when they want to.  [I don&#39;t know...<br/>
maybe this has become illegal or something... but when I was in school if I<br/>
had a note from my parent it didn&#39;t matter how much school I missed.]  See<br/>
what that&#39;s like rather than waiting until Summer and continuing with all<br/>
of the arguments.  You say they like school, so perhaps they would like to<br/>
go if it&#39;s really their choice.  Or, maybe you will discover that staying<br/>
home really works out great and you didn&#39;t have to wait after all.<br/>

You&#39;re living your way now.  You&#39;re choosing the rough mornings and the <br/>

<br/>
You could say they need to be in bed but they don&#39;t have to be asleep.  Make <br/>
it easy for them to listen to tapes or CDS (books on tape or music) or to <br/>
watch movies to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=Would it squelch their ability to distinguish when <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think so.   <br/>
Sheesh, with no quiet time, NOBODY sleeps.  But if by quiet you mean silent <br/>
and in the dark, yeah that&#39;s squelching.  I used to be put in my room, told to <br/>
go to sleep, and have the light turned off on me.  I had lots of nightmares.  <br/>
My daughter, at 13, has never had a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids want to go to school to hang out with their friends, that&#39;s a <br/>
good reason.  If you want them to finish the year because it seems finishing a <br/>
year is the way life should be, that&#39;s not a good reason.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;Hi all.  I&#39;m fairly new here (been lurking for some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time) and don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here yet.  Jill,<br/>
your post really resonated with me.  We too were<br/>
thrilled to get into an alternative school by lottery<br/>
in our neck of the woods (Brooklyn, NY) and it didn&#39;t<br/>
live up to our expectations.  My oldest son (8) ended<br/>
up falling thru the cracks big time and I began trying<br/>
to advocate for him with the Board of Ed.  I decided<br/>
this past summer that he wasn&#39;t going back to school. <br/>
I wanted to pull him out in April of last year but<br/>
everyone advised me not to as it would limit our<br/>
&#39;choices&#39; as we moved forward, blah, blah, blah. <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had listened to my instincts instead of<br/>
&#39;everyone&#39;.  It would have been two months less<br/>
torture for my ds.  Your situation sounds a bit<br/>
different, but if your kids really want it, you may<br/>
want to consider taking them out of school sooner than<br/>
later.  On the brighter side, the big pluses of their<br/>
school experience was that we met some really great<br/>
families, most of whom we still see on a regualar<br/>
basis.<br/>
<br/>
We had some issues surrounding the bedtime thing as<br/>
well (mostly my husband had the issues).  The kids<br/>
(boys, 8 and 6) were staying up till 1, 2 in the AM<br/>
and as a result I was staying up till 3, 4.  They<br/>
never went to bed early even when they were in school,<br/>
but it became a little extreme - even for their<br/>
nocturnal momma!  So, we had a family discussion about<br/>
it, and compromised on a time (for us, 9:45) that the<br/>
kids would start to get ready for bed - baths or<br/>
showers, brush teeth, pick up their room a bit (with<br/>
our help) and pick out books to read or to be read to<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
All this was decided with the proviso that if they<br/>
were involved in something they could take an<br/>
additional 15 min or whatever time they needed to<br/>
complete it.  Also, I made the commitment to be<br/>
available to them for a hour to read to them or talk,<br/>
sing, whatever, in their room.  So at about 11 or so,<br/>
I close their door and they can sleep, sit in bed and<br/>
read, talk to each other, read to each other, what<br/>
have you. They know too that they are always welcome<br/>
in our bed if they feel like it.  I guess we have more<br/>
of a flexible guideline for them to be in their room<br/>
and (preferably) in bed than a bedtime.  Having this<br/>
guideline before it&#39;s time for bed really seems to<br/>
help them wind down a lot.  That way when I gently<br/>
remind them that it&#39;s 9:30, and then 9;45, they know<br/>
they still have lots of time to &#39;be up&#39; and do some<br/>
more stuff.  They also know that it&#39;s flexible and we<br/>
will respect their input and needs if they need to be<br/>
up doing something longer.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t take baths or showers every day, but<br/>
when they do at night, I see a big difference in how<br/>
relaxed and &#39;ready&#39; for bed (as in actually sleeping)<br/>
they are.  Also, my kids sometimes drink tea with me<br/>
before bed.  They love cocoa spice (yogi tea brand),<br/>
but you can make your own with cocoa powder, cinnamon<br/>
and/or cardamom, and a little honey and milk.  We<br/>
never did the hot milk thing, but I can see how that<br/>
might be soothing as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a few weeks of doing this and has made a<br/>
huge difference.  We&#39;ve had no complaints from them<br/>
about it what-so-ever and we&#39;ve all been getting up a<br/>
bit earlier (tho-they are never up before 10Am) which<br/>
gives us a jump on the day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Sorry it got so long<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jill, I can appreciate where you are coming from because we went through <br/>
Kindergarten last year.  My ds was happy and having a great time.  Kindergarten <br/>
was playtime to him and he wanted to stay.  They were having holiday parties and <br/>
plays, and he was in art class.  An award party for advanced readers, and <br/>
tons of fun things.  He wasn&#39;t ready to leave.  I was ready for him to leave, I <br/>
had regained my confidence to live the way we always had.  School was hard on <br/>
our family, and we definitely never had much of a schedule and that was a real <br/>
challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
We all talked about it and he knew what life was like before.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
really like getting up at the same time everyday, or missing out on shopping and <br/>
parks and all that.  Playing with his brother, being with us.  He didn&#39;t like <br/>
when the teachers made him wait to do things because other kids didn&#39;t know how <br/>
and they needed help first or when they counldn&#39;t go outside on gorgeous days <br/>
cuz the teachers had things to do.  So unless it was FUN, he wasn&#39;t thrilled. <br/>
 He chose to stay in with the option of staying home whenever he wanted.  He <br/>
felt good to finish the year and so did I (sort of).  We set aside our true <br/>
living for many months and I can never get that back.<br/>
<br/>
He hasn&#39;t really mentioned school since the end of last year.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are choosing to stay in and see it as fun and social, awesome.  <br/>
But if it&#39;s a struggle in the mornings and the yelling kinda gets you all off <br/>
on the wrong foot, then I&#39;d end it now.  Unlearn all that&#39;s not needed and <br/>
recapture what life was like before schooling.  Enjoy them now in all their <br/>
freedom and innocence.  I knew what that was before kindergarten and boy!!! do I <br/>
appreciate it soooo much more now that it&#39;s over.<br/>
<br/>
As for bedtimes, get a &quot;winding down for the day&quot; routine going.  Baths, <br/>
reading stories, or whatever gets everyone in a lazy, comfy mood.  Our 3 year old <br/>
is a fantastic snoozer so he usually tells us when he&#39;s ready.  He&#39;ll ask if <br/>
it&#39;s naptime yet.   As for our 7 year old, he loves reading time and he likes <br/>
to lay in our bed and watch TV, sometimes with us or while we&#39;re in the living <br/>
room watchin&#39; our own stuff.  But he is usually ready by 10 or so.  He&#39;ll play <br/>
his gameboy or watch videos on it until he&#39;s alseep.  I think the key is that <br/>
if they want to stay up, they can.  We just ask that it&#39;s quiet when we are <br/>
in bed.  They know daddy has to work.  They know I like to take short naps <br/>
sometimes during the day.  We have always made an effort to do quiet things if <br/>
someone in the house is resting and that just extends into the night too. <br/>
<br/>
You have a toddler and a newborn too.  So sleep is essential for you when you <br/>
can get it.  Make it a point that staying up is their choice but once you and <br/>
your hubby are in bed or the little ones are in bed for the night, that it is <br/>
time for quiet activities.  But I would definitely get jammies on and all <br/>
that.  That seems to help with winding down.<br/>

Your mornings should definitely improve when you take the kids <br/>
out of school.  Our mornings are great, the kids sleep until <br/>
they wake up.  As for the situation with your mother, when my<br/>
mom asks, &quot;but when do you have time to homeschool?&quot; I always <br/>
tell her that she knows that is not what we do, and then I ask if she<br/>
thinks my kids are somehow lacking.  Her answer is always &quot;no way!&quot;<br/>
I then get to smile and say she&#39;s welcome to let me know if she<br/>
ever feels they are.  good luck coming into the unschooling world,<br/>

&gt; &quot;How about just not go to school when your kids don&#39;t want to go... let<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; stay home when they want to, and go when they want to&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve not posted before, but just wanted to note that in our state a<br/>
&gt; parent can be charged for their child&#39;s truancy.  If a child misses too<br/>
&gt; many days the parent can end up on probation!  Unbelievable.  So, I<br/>
&gt; pulled my son out of their school.  lol<br/>

&gt; &gt;They tell me they like school, but would rather stay home.  I dread<br/>
&gt; &gt;getting up mornings, we yell and get a rather harsh start just about<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt;day<br/>

&gt; &gt;The kids do enjoy going to school, so I think we are going to finish up<br/>
&gt; &gt;the year and just not go back next year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Jill,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How about just not go to school when your kids don&#39;t want to go... let<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; stay home when they want to, and go when they want to.  [I don&#39;t know...<br/>
&gt; maybe this has become illegal or something... but when I was in school<br/>
&gt; if I<br/>
&gt; had a note from my parent it didn&#39;t matter how much school I missed.]<br/>
&gt; See<br/>
&gt; what that&#39;s like rather than waiting until Summer and continuing with<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; of the arguments.  You say they like school, so perhaps they would like<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; go if it&#39;s really their choice.  Or, maybe you will discover that<br/>
&gt; staying<br/>
&gt; home really works out great and you didn&#39;t have to wait after all.<br/>

<br/>
They like to go to school to be with their friends.  My dd (5 1/2) <br/>
really likes her teachers, too.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know we really need to change our morning routine...<br/>
<br/>
My mom...she&#39;s pretty strong in her opinions.  She doesn&#39;t ever <br/>
stand in my way of what I want to do, just has no problem voicing <br/>
her dislike or why she doesn&#39;t agree.  But I certainly wouldn&#39;t <br/>
change my mind because of her opinion or idea, if its something I <br/>
feel strongly about.  I just mentioned it because that&#39;s how she is <br/>
and that&#39;s what I&#39;m up against, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, if they had a terminal disease, I&#39;d do what would make them <br/>
happiest, of course!  If that meant staying in school, that would be <br/>
fine.  If that meant staying home, well, that would be better.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a little bit of poison at a time, I see what you mean.  <br/>
And maybe I am just in denial, but since they like going to school <br/>
and it isn&#39;t just a regular sit in your desk all day and do <br/>
meaningless paperwork kind of school, I don&#39;t see it as dire.  Of <br/>
course, its not as good as being home, but that is what I am <br/>
struggling with, I guess.  Why is it so difficult to just do it?!  <br/>
Does it get easier once they are signed out?  I hope so...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399430039"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had some issues surrounding the bedtime thing as<br/>
&gt; well (mostly my husband had the issues).  The kids<br/>
&gt; (boys, 8 and 6) were staying up till 1, 2 in the AM<br/>
&gt; and as a result I was staying up till 3, 4.  They<br/>
&gt; never went to bed early even when they were in school,<br/>
&gt; but it became a little extreme - even for their<br/>
&gt; nocturnal momma!  So, we had a family discussion about<br/>
&gt; it, and compromised on a time (for us, 9:45) that the<br/>
&gt; kids would start to get ready for bed - baths or<br/>
&gt; showers, brush teeth, pick up their room a bit (with<br/>
&gt; our help) and pick out books to read or to be read to<br/>
&gt; them.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this was decided with the proviso that if they<br/>
&gt; were involved in something they could take an<br/>
&gt; additional 15 min or whatever time they needed to<br/>
&gt; complete it.  Also, I made the commitment to be<br/>
&gt; available to them for a hour to read to them or talk,<br/>
&gt; sing, whatever, in their room.  So at about 11 or so,<br/>
&gt; I close their door and they can sleep, sit in bed and<br/>
&gt; read, talk to each other, read to each other, what<br/>
&gt; have you. They know too that they are always welcome<br/>
&gt; in our bed if they feel like it.  I guess we have more<br/>
&gt; of a flexible guideline for them to be in their room<br/>
&gt; and (preferably) in bed than a bedtime.  Having this<br/>
&gt; guideline before it&#39;s time for bed really seems to<br/>
&gt; help them wind down a lot.  That way when I gently<br/>
&gt; remind them that it&#39;s 9:30, and then 9;45, they know<br/>
&gt; they still have lots of time to &#39;be up&#39; and do some<br/>
&gt; more stuff.  They also know that it&#39;s flexible and we<br/>
&gt; will respect their input and needs if they need to be<br/>
&gt; up doing something longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your advice!  I would definately be comfortable with <br/>
something like this, and I think dh would be too.  I know the kids <br/>
would be good with it, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, <br/>

lolligags arounds, and gets distracted very easily, even getting <br/>

to stay just a little longer and that helps you with the extra time you<br/>
need!  Congratulations!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127823036">&lt;&lt; They are like that whenever we get ready, especially my oldest.  He <br/>
<br/>
lolligags arounds, and gets distracted very easily, even getting <br/>
<br/>
ready for places he wants to go (friends houses, playing in the <br/>
<br/>
snow, etc.)  It&#39;s worse for school because its every morning and <br/>
<br/>
theres a time issue. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It can help if parents avoid really negative terminology like &quot;lolligags.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not good, &quot;lolligagging.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t even SOUND good.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he just doesn&#39;t really want to play in the snow or go to a friend&#39;s <br/>
house.  Maybe he just needs more help.  Some parents expect too much of children. <br/>
 They think that if a child can tie his own shoes the mom should never help <br/>
him again, or once the child can sound out some words the mom doesn&#39;t need to <br/>
read aloud to him anymore.<br/>
<br/>
HELP children get out of the house, and not only will they get out more <br/>
easily, but they will have had a shared time in which their mother was being kind <br/>
and generous with them.   I still help my teenaged boys get out of the house <br/>
sometimes, and they&#39;re competent enough to get themselves up and out on time <br/>
even if I&#39;m not here.  But if I&#39;m up and they&#39;re needing to get up and go, I will <br/>
offer breakfast, make sure they have clean socks, remind them of things they <br/>
might have wanted to take or do, help them review the day (as in &quot;are you <br/>
coming right back after, or stopping somewhere else?&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t forget to call <br/>
Ryan&quot; or &quot;Did you ask for that weekend off for the trip to Arizona?&quot; or <br/>
whatever).   <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think I said this in reference to not having a bedtime at all.  I <br/>
<br/>
meant I needed to know after a certain time, I&#39;d be able to have <br/>
<br/>
some quiet time for me after being fully available to them all day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you look at it as what you need instead of what will help them learn about <br/>
themselves and their bodies&#39; signals and needs in the longrun, that&#39;s find.  <br/>
The vast majority of people do that.  But if you want to see things in terms <br/>
of principles and of children&#39;s needs, there are other ways to see.<br/>
<br/>
But all in all, your kids are in school and so most of what we&#39;re saying <br/>
won&#39;t apply or can&#39;t be seen until you&#39;re really unschooling.<br/>
