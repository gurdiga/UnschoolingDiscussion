<div id="ygrps-yiv-206555302">Poor Marty.  He doesn&#39;t get as many stories told about him as Kirby does.  <br/>
He&#39;s more quiet (in a quantity, not quality way--he&#39;s loud when he does talk) <br/>
and more comfortable in himself and in the world than the other two kids, so <br/>
he doesn&#39;t get the tales of conflict, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was on the city&#39;s police department webpages, trying to find out <br/>
where to report my half-brother&#39;s possible wherabouts.  Four phone calls <br/>
later, I still hadn&#39;t found anyone to take the information.   But in the <br/>
course of looking, I found summer sessions of the Junior Police Academy.  <br/>
Five days in June, free, to honor students who are recommended by a sponsor.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  We have no &quot;honor&quot; status and he has no principal, counsellor, school <br/>
resource officer or scout leader.  <br/>
<br/>
But we do have a friend who&#39;s a city policeman.  And in the SCA, he&#39;s a <br/>
knight.  And he was squired to someone who was my husband&#39;s squire.  So we <br/>
have a real relationship and he&#39;s known Marty since he was a baby (and I&#39;ve <br/>
known AElric since he was a long-haired college kid).  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one.<br/>
And I talked to the coordinator who after going through the list of <br/>
possibilities, sending them what I have to send the state, or test score <br/>
results, understood that I have no such stuff.   So  I think I&#39;ll write a <br/>
letter, enclose a copy of the interview in HEM to try to prove I&#39;m not <br/>
totally just individually off the wall, and tell him it will add to the <br/>
diversity of their academy. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, I thought, might or might not be interested.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s said for most of a year now he wants to be a cop or an air force MP, or <br/>
a wrestler. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;You need to be able to run for 20 minutes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sprinting or jogging?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, jogging, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said he could do that.  I read more later.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you do twenty push-ups?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;GOD no, maybe twelve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well by June, you need to do twenty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe he was going to balk because of that, but last night he was <br/>
telling his friends he was GOING to this session and it was going to be cool. <br/>
 I said &quot;MIGHT go, Marty,&quot; and he said, &quot;NO, I&#39;m GOING!&quot;  And Mark Elrick <br/>
(who&#39;s Sir AElric in the SCA) already called and said he&#39;d write a letter to <br/>
help Marty get in.<br/>
<br/>
The age range is 12 to 14.  Marty&#39;s 14.  I never heard of it before, but then <br/>
again, Marty hadn&#39;t told me two years ago that he might want to be a <br/>
policeman.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to see he&#39;s excited about it.   I hope he&#39;ll be accepted!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979972344">Marty&#39;s the only kid home.<br/>
<br/>
I just got a call from another unschooling mom saying she had picked up Holly <br/>
and Kristy (Holly spent the night a Kristy&#39;s after Harry Potter, so I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen her since she marched happily away yesterday with her big jester&#39;s hat <br/>
on) and they&#39;re going to the wildlife center  for the birthday of another <br/>
homeschooler.  Holly was a last-minute addition, but she apparently wanted to <br/>
go, and was already in the car when the driver-mom called.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby walked to driver&#39;s ed and will walk on up to work after that.  I won&#39;t <br/>
see him until late if at all.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s still asleep.  I wasn&#39;t expecting this day to be so quiet.  And I <br/>
can&#39;t offer to take Marty anywhere because the van&#39;s in the shop.  But he has <br/>
access to the new Zelda game now, and his own memory card, so he won&#39;t need <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
And Joey, our extra ghostly kid, is up in Kirby&#39;s room, probably still <br/>
asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Very unexpectedly quiet.<br/>
