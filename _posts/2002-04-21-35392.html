&lt;&lt;  I am saddened however to see the degradation of topics, when a person <br/>
comes up with a question about how to get a &#39;lesson&#39; across, I would be the <br/>
first person to give examples of how we learn in our home without the need <br/>
for lessons or workbooks, and also plenty of examples where my children <br/>
choose to use them, ask for them when we are in a bookstore, and guess what <br/>
folks .. I don&#39;t say to them &quot;ohhh heaven forbid NOOOOOOO we are unschoolers, <br/>
its a horrible thing to learn from a workbook or lesson book....bite your <br/>
tongue child &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then why don&#39;t you answer her in that way?<br/>
Don&#39;t attack the way other people answer a post just because it&#39;s not the way <br/>
YOU would answer. Just hit delete and answer the person in the way you think <br/>
is most helpful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No one has a clue if this was the situation or not,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I usually have a clue before I answer a post. How rude to assume I didn&#39;t.<br/>
She was asking specifically how to teach a lesson to a child.<br/>
Re-read the post if you&#39;re not sure.<br/>
<br/>
My first post consisted of items I thought would be helpful, the second was <br/>
pointing out that in the unschooling context, lessons are not the best way to <br/>
learn.<br/>
In the future, it would be helpful for people to answer the original post <br/>
themselves, instead of attacking the way another person answers the post.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Perhaps answering those kinds of questions with support, explanations and<br/>
 encouragement instead of &quot;you aren&#39;t an unschooler, good-bye &gt;&gt;<br/>

I didn&#39;t think anyone had done that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; <br/>
 Just in case anybody remembers, until about a week ago, I kept workbooks out <br/>
 of reach of my children, believing they were too young to reach for them and <br/>
 not &quot;destroy&quot; them.<br/>
 <br/>
 After a considerable amount of angst and self-reflection, I put them on the <br/>
 accessible bookshelf. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And this is exactly why I feel it is so important to discuss unschooling <br/>
ideas and philosophies and question people when something doesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;I think I am experiencing an &quot;unschooling breakthrough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I have also just stopped listening to what I think the children &quot;need&quot; to <br/>
participate in, and started listening to what the &quot;want&quot; to participate in.)<br/>
<br/>
Loving letting go&#39;<br/>
<br/>
It feels good doesn&#39;t it?  Keep on keepin&#39; on!!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I feel bad that so much emphasis is being given on *exact words* .  I <br/>
really<br/>
think if people would read an entire post and not zero in on any *exact<br/>
words* then maybe there would be a lot less misunderstanding which leads to<br/>
conversations that just go in circles and get nowhere. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And after that we could go to being more vague on ideas, and soon nobody <br/>
would criticize anything, but no good ideas would be exchanged either.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not MISunderstanding to point out when a concept is missing the mark, or <br/>
when unschooling isn&#39;t being seen clearly, and the closer a person is to the <br/>
idea, the more it&#39;s worth saying &quot;just a little to the left,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re in <br/>
the right place, but turn around--it&#39;s right behind you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of lists where people just welcome the heck out of each other <br/>
and praise all kinds of stuff and exchange recipes and talk about their dogs <br/>
and the weather and what they&#39;re planting in their yards.  Some people love <br/>
social lists where  there&#39;s no focus of subject.<br/>
<br/>
When people are deciding whether and how to homeschool, they&#39;re often needing <br/>
some good, solid, clear information and quickly.  There are experienced <br/>
unschoolers trying to help people understand clearly and quickly.  And there <br/>
are often a few inexperienced ones complaining about it.  <br/>
