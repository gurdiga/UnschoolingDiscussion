Hi,<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about you other than what you have written about  <br/>
television and school on your website.  But I have to say I am shocked  <br/>
by how angry you sound at people who think that the majority of  <br/>
programming on television is rude, crude, sexist and anti-family.  I  <br/>
know plenty of people who have a blasé attitude about television, but  <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen anyone so viscously pro-tv before.  Do you watch  <br/>
television?  Have you channel surfed at all hours of the day?  I have  <br/>
spent a lot of time watching television the last two years, while on  <br/>
bed rest, and I&#39;ve watched all hours of the day and night.  I know  <br/>
what is on tv.  Let me ask you, would you find it offensive if I came  <br/>
into your house and had sex in front of your children?  Would you be  <br/>
appalled if I went into your neighbors house and had sex in front of  <br/>
their children?  How would you feel if the neighbors kids came and  <br/>
told your children about what they saw?  Well that is what tv does and  <br/>
that is how it works.  Even if you don&#39;t let your kids watch it,  <br/>
someone else&#39;s children will and will influence your children with  <br/>
that information.  I truly wish you will rethink your position.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Your Neighbor<br/>
<br/>
PS- The sex analogy is just the tip of the iceburg.  Sex, drugs,  <br/>
sexism, racism, violence, no respect for parental authority and no  <br/>
respect for humanity is what tv brings us.<br/>
<br/>
================================<br/>
<br/>
Well, you just came and ranted at me in my e-mail, while I never  <br/>
contacted you directly.<br/>
No one in my family is that antagonistic.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you saw anger on my site.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have spent a lot of time watching television the last two years,  <br/>
while on bed rest-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you buy some books or magazines, or rent DVDs?  No one is  <br/>
forcing you to watch television.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Let me ask you, would you find it offensive if I came into your  <br/>
house and had sex in front of your children?  Would you be appalled if  <br/>
I went into your neighbors house and had sex in front of their  <br/>
children? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you insane?<br/>
I do feel a little bit like you came into my computer and took a crap  <br/>
on my screen.<br/>
<br/>
-= Even if you don&#39;t let your kids watch it, someone else&#39;s children  <br/>
will and will influence your children with that information.  I truly  <br/>
wish you will rethink your position.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rethinking my position&quot; won&#39;t change anything, if you&#39;re correct that  <br/>
other people&#39;s children will come and have all the ill effects of  <br/>
television even if I were to have prevented mine from watching it.<br/>
<br/>
I did let my children watch it, and they&#39;ve grown up into sweet and  <br/>
peaceful young adults who would never dream of addressing anyone as  <br/>
you have me.<br/>
<br/>
-=I don&#39;t know anything about you other than what you have written  <br/>
about television and school on your website. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should get to know more about a person before you attack  <br/>
her so rudely and directly.  I have written very little about school  <br/>
anywhere, and most of what is on my site about television was not  <br/>
written by me.<br/>

Well maybe I should&#39;ve asked whether her (I had assumed it to be a  <br/>
&quot;he&quot; from the tone, but I could be wrong) parents let her watch TV all  <br/>
she wanted all hours of the day and night.  If no, then...  Oh right.   <br/>
It was undoubtedly no.  And the result?  Hostility and funky thinking.  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what those kind of comments make me think!  There is nothing so overwhelmingly depressing in all the world than seeing the world through fear and crap.  I don&#39;t watch sex, drugs, sexism, racism, violence, and disrespect on tv.  I watch fascinating things, like forensic science, humor, romance, history, mystery, and the wonderful world of human nature, of humans being humans doing human things.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that this person watches too many news programs and not enough of the good stuff on tv!  If that person has a teenager in school, I&#39;d bet money that their kid talks about sex, drugs, and has experienced violence, racism, and disrespect of adults and humanity in general.<br/>

<br/>
I honestly think most kids who have positive parents, thinking positively about the world, will get from tv, things that will most likely be positive, since the environment in which they are dwelling IS positive.  My kids have been positively influenced by tv, just as they&#39;ve been positively influenced by their parents.  <br/>
<br/>
If this person has kids and is saying &quot;bad, wrong, dangerous&quot; about things in the world in general, tv included, then kids will likely carry that kind of negative thinking around in their thoughts.  The kids will not think positively about their parents and their idiotic thoughts, especially once they are old enough to suddenly realize that they have their own minds and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
***I am sorry your not willing to hear your veiwers opinions.***<br/>
<br/>
OHHH I LOVE that one!  Clearly, &quot;hearing&quot; is the same as agreeing and doing.  I bet they do the same thing to their kids... &quot;turn the tv off and clean up your room.&quot; .... no response, then &quot;you&#39;re not listening, I told you to turn the tv off and clean your room.&quot;  I&#39;m pretty sure the kid heard and listened to that demand, but chose to ignore it and not agree like a mindless robot.<br/>

but I&#39;ve never seen anyone so viscously pro-tv before.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The words &quot;blasé&quot; and &quot;visciously&quot; are interpretations of the<br/>
behavior. And the way the whole thing is phrased is an admission that<br/>
anything pro-tv is out of the speaker&#39;s realm of experience. Just lose<br/>
those two words and you&#39;ll see that: &quot;I know plenty of people who have<br/>
a(n) attitude about television, but I&#39;ve never seen anyone so pro-tv<br/>
before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, ok. There&#39;s a first time for everything!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s potentially contentious thought: &quot;I know people who don&#39;t mind<br/>
guns, but I&#39;ve never met anyone (in the WHOLE wide world of my past<br/>
experience) who was so pro-gun before!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the tv. It&#39;s not the guns. Without people thinking up<br/>
inappropriate uses for tv and guns, there would be no going to<br/>
people&#39;s houses and doing private acts publicly. Some people just like<br/>
to hit targets and that&#39;s why they have guns. They don&#39;t kill anything<br/>
with them. It&#39;s not guns. It&#39;s not tv&#39;s. It&#39;s not sex (the way that<br/>
children get into this world, remember, so it&#39;s a good thing!) None of<br/>
those things are harmful for children to know about. It&#39;s the thinking<br/>
about them that can be harmful.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s possible for all the tv&#39;s, guns, sex to vanish, and we<br/>
could decry the presence of some other thing that seems like it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be in the same world as children.<br/>

I&#39;ve channel surfed all hours of the day, and night. Like everybody else in my family, I&#39;m free to watch whatever I choose whenever I choose. In the past week, I&#39;ve watched with my son one episode of Mythbusters and an episode of NCIS; with my wife, one episode of The Restaurant (Raymond Blanc) and a movie called Martian Child; on my own, one episode of New Tricks (UK cop show) and an episode of Eggheads (UK quiz show). Oh and I watched half an episode of Torchwood to please my wife, who&#39;s a fan, and thought it was so daft I probably will never watch Torchwood again. That&#39;s it. In a whole week. Probably an average of less than an hour of TV a day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true I do watch TV for hours on end during the MLB playoffs and World Series and no doubt will be glued to the screen for a lot of the upcoming soccer World Cup - but, really, watching whatever&#39;s on TV because that&#39;s what happens to be on at the time, that&#39;s sad.<br/>

Assumimg &quot;pro-TVers&quot; do the same is kind of sad too.<br/>

<br/>
Why so eager to find rotten things festering inside other people?<br/>
<br/>
Dylan achieved the rank of brown belt in Karate *and* Tae Kwon Do ; Five<br/>
years of study and hard work and he got interested in martial arts from<br/>
watching old Japanese movies.  He saw those movies on TV because, well,<br/>
they&#39;re old, and not shown in theaters (at least not around here) anymore.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learning Italian and he got interested in that from watching Italian TV<br/>
on the web and from watching Italian horror movies on TV. (same deal, not<br/>
shown in theaters around here.)<br/>
<br/>
He got interested in digital music from music he first heard on Television <br/>
and<br/>
now owns three synthesizers and plays very well, has learned a bunch about<br/>
electronics.<br/>
<br/>
He got interested in playing the organ from watching a movie on TV, &quot;The <br/>
Abominable Dr. Phibes.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He now plays the organ really well, no lessons, just plenty of good Phibes. <br/>
(I make myself sick)<br/>
<br/>
As a direct result of watching TV he learned how to use an old 16mm camera <br/>
and to make stop motion films.  He has a better camera today and is still <br/>
making videos and taking really beautiful photographs.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of watching TV he&#39;s written several stories and screen plays.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t begin to count the number of books he&#39;s read because he first saw <br/>
the story on TV on some old Twilight Zone episode or saw a movie based on a <br/>
short story or novel.    Authors like Richard Matheson, August Derleth, H.P. <br/>
Lovecraft, Henry James...<br/>
<br/>
I have, a couple different times, tried to write all the things Dylan has <br/>
learned as a result of watching TV.  I haven&#39;t been able to finish.  There&#39;s <br/>
just too much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262579892">My first reaction:  How does trespassing and performing lewd acts as a<br/>
trespasser resemble depictions of sex? For one thing I&#39;d be scared the<br/>
trespasser were going to rape me...or kill me or my kids.  As an analogy the<br/>
prowler/sex addict scenario fails because even if the remote didn&#39;t work,<br/>
and you could walk/wheel your way to the set to change the channel somehow<br/>
you would have a choice.  In the absence a working channel changer on the<br/>
set or faulty off switch off the set or change the channel then the option<br/>
is just unplugging the set or changing tv sets.  If money is an issue<br/>
Freecyle or Craigslist or trash day may provide a working set.<br/>
<br/>
My second reaction:  Real acts of sex on television would only be there if<br/>
he/she made &quot;personal&quot; films or tuned into some sort of sex channel.  But I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine any regulatory body allowing sex on television--the frontal<br/>
nudity is still contentious among tv censors:)<br/>
<br/>
What does this person think of computers?  Even with the best of filters<br/>
someone named Bambi or some guy named Troy(who claims to be well hung)<br/>
inevitably surprizes me with lewd pics or propositions.  I delete them and<br/>
report them as spam.  You have way more control over images on tv than on<br/>
computers, where my son&#39;s searches for the kinder chocolate egg sites often<br/>
ended up redirected to porn sites--leading to explanations.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that to people who are anti-tv everyone is pro-tv.  I think<br/>
like everything tv works for some and not for other people.  My kids watch<br/>
television--we don&#39;t have porn stations where I live, though there is lots<br/>
stuff we find silly or unappealing we wouldn&#39;t stop others from watching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647281358">The original email reminds me of a forum I belonged to when I first started homeschooling.  At least once a week someone would start a thread about the perils of TV, video games, or too much computer use.  The responses would be filled with lots of dramatic enchancements: *gasp* and *wow* and *I have no words!*, dealing with such issues as &quot;My mother-in-law wants the kids to play Wii!&quot; and &quot;I met an unschooler who lets her kids play video games 16 hours a day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At first I tried to summon the appropriate indignation to match the thread; then I began to find it amusing; then I finally left the board because I realized that the posters were spending so much time defining what homeschooling couldn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be, there was no space left to explore any possibilities.<br/>

That&#39;s probably it.  It&#39;s hard to picture Sandra rushing around, forcing TV <br/>
viewing on others though.  &quot;Watch it, or else.  &lt;g&gt;   I think any of her <br/>
comments that can be considered pro-TV have been in response to anti-TV <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pro TV.  I love it and I wish I was finding time to watch more of it! <br/>
I&#39;m still fascinated and in awe of television technology.  It&#39;s just so cool <br/>
that someone can be in a studio across the country or on the other side of <br/>
the world and I can turn on my TV and listen to what they have to say, see <br/>
the pictures they&#39;re sharing.   I&#39;m not afraid of hearing ideas I disagree <br/>
with and I don&#39;t feel guilty about being entertained.<br/>
<br/>
But, ***I was talking about its influence on children.***<br/>
<br/>
I have seen TV&#39;s influence Dylan and it&#39;s been really positive.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
get interested in TV until he was around three, probably, and he&#39;s watched a <br/>
lot of TV over the years.  I can&#39;t think of any unpleasant thing he&#39;s done <br/>
as a result of being influenced by TV.  He&#39;s never beaten up other kids, <br/>
stolen anything, wrecked the car or knocked over a convenience store. <br/>
Doesn&#39;t lie, drink or smoke, doesn&#39;t take drugs, hasn&#39;t joined a gang. He <br/>
hasn&#39;t damaged other people&#39;s property, kicked a dog, lit a cat on fire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314409283">I found my boys were uninterested in television until 31/2-4 years of age.<br/>
They didn&#39;t like to sit still, but prefered action and messy play.  Plus,<br/>
they wanted to interact with real people, lol.    At the time though other<br/>
moms wanted to help me find tv shows(teletubbies, Sesame Street) to<br/>
entertain the kids, so I could have time to myself, lol.  My theory about<br/>
one group of the tv haters is they introduced  tv to escape their kids<br/>
demands.  Probably, took ages to get the kids to bond  with the tv, but the<br/>
parents always want control of the duration and value of programs!<br/>

Well, true of Kirby and karate.  He wanted to learn karate because of  <br/>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which also brought him the learning  <br/>
involved in waking up early to record it and cut the commercials out  <br/>
as he went, so he could go back to bed.  In a box, somewhere in this  <br/>

<br/>
I guess I was wrecking the &quot;not caring&quot; curve, but I (WE, because most  <br/>
of the stories there are by people on this list or its predecessor- <br/>
lists and forum)... I was talking about television, and audio-video  <br/>
input in general, and about learning.  The person who wrote to me was  <br/>
talking about ME, and evil, and sex, and my children (in a little bit  <br/>
of a creepy, threatening way, emotionally) and suggesting I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know my children well enough to see the bad effects of TV, but if he/ <br/>
she knew the family he/she could point out the wrongheadedness.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed VERY aggressive to me, but the response came back that it  <br/>
didn&#39;t seem rude.<br/>
<br/>
But then I don&#39;t surf the TV day and night.  Maybe the result of  <br/>
someone doing that is that they build up negativity and unleash it on  <br/>
someone who said what they were doing wasn&#39;t so bad.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all kind of twisty-contorted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129876590">I tried the limitation/value approach with the TV years ago because I was finding it a major means of procrastination for myself - and I patted myself on the back about all of the good quality time my daughter would be spending doing other things if I limited TV altogether.<br/>
<br/>
I did find that I stopped procrastinating somewhat and that I got more enjoyment from the shows I chose to watch...but my daughter wasn&#39;t watching that much TV to begin with, so keeping her from the few shows she did want to see was pretty pointless and kind of mean.  It didn&#39;t last long.<br/>
<br/>
Now that she&#39;s getting older, most of the TV we watch involves nighttime programming - a lot of it on TLC. We live within a short driving distance of the Cake Boss bakery and had the fortune of meeting several of the people on the show and learning more about how to make those kinds of cakes.  It&#39;s also been interesting to watch the bakery change from a regular neighborhood place to a chaotic tourist attraction requiring barricades for the waiting customers on the weekends.  <br/>
<br/>
Another show that has made for very interesting discussions has been the new season of Celebrity Apprentice.  My daughter&#39;s initial pull was Cyndi Lauper, so what started out as musical taste has branched into price points, leadership, competition, playing fair, winning, losing, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Enriching, definitely - and from as objective a perspective as I can put myself, I&#39;m failing to see anything detrimental.  <br/>

better place had that child been watching television at that moment  <br/>
instead of damaging life and property.<br/>
<br/>
Television would have saved MANY young people from the justice  <br/>
system.  It still could.  Television can save all juvenile delinquents  <br/>
if their parents will just MAKE THEM WATCH TELEVISION!!!<br/>
<br/>
For those who stole, lied, drank, smoked, did opium, joined gangs,  <br/>
kicked dogs before 1950....   wait.  Are we sure any of those things  <br/>
happened before television was invented?  I don&#39;t see how, without the  <br/>
influence of television, any person would get any bad ideas.<br/>

I was finding it a major means of procrastination for myself --=-<br/>
<br/>
Before we ever had kids, Keith and I used to get TV Guide and the  <br/>
local PBS magazine so that we could plan in advance what we were going  <br/>
to watch on TV.  We didn&#39;t just turn it on and &quot;surf.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t &quot;a  <br/>
rule,&quot; it just made sense because we had a lot of hobbies and meetings  <br/>
and singing practices we wanted to plan around, but VCRs weren&#39;t  <br/>
available in homes yet, so if we missed something, it was missed.<br/>
<br/>
But that developed into a &quot;read first and then turn it on&quot; practice  <br/>
between the two of us.  And when the kids came along and we did have a  <br/>
VCR and some videos for them, and the ability to rent others, they  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t just turn it on either.  They would ask what was on, or ask  <br/>
to watch a certain video, or I might recommend something.  Kirby  <br/>
learned to tell time because of shows he liked to watch.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a big deal at all.  Anytime someone wanted to watch  <br/>
something the answer was going to be yes.  We didn&#39;t leave it on for  <br/>
background noise, though.    We still don&#39;t.<br/>

3.5 was what I meant.  Before that he didn&#39;t care to watch for too long.  I<br/>
watched with him so I was disappointed on occasion;)<br/>
<br/>
but if he turned off the tv or  took out Lego I turned off the tv.<br/>
<br/>
But Rowan was really fascinated by the converter before the tv and Crispin<br/>
loves dvds.   Other mothers who admired Rowan&#39;s math skills were<br/>
disappointed to learn it was changing channels with a remote, which really<br/>
inspired him to master numbers.  They controlled the remote.  We just got a<br/>
family package.  I think I wrote about that before on this list...<br/>
