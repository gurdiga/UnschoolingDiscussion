 </span></blockquote>I think in some of our efforts to give our children freedom of <br/>
choices we can get so caught up in it that we do not see the forest <br/>
for the trees. It sounded to me, like you were so concerned about <br/>
disrespecting Elliot&#39;s wishes that you lost sight of what was <br/>
happening.  If this kid thinks you are condoning his behavior, I <br/>
shudder to think what he will do if you are not around.  You, as an <br/>
adult and property owner have the right to discourage that type of <br/>
behaviour.  To be honest, if I see any kids treating a child, not my <br/>
own, that way I would step in.  I see it at the park sometimes.  Kids <br/>
thinking they can get nasty when there parents are not around.  I <br/>
give them a hellavu look and then intervene.  It is not about control <br/>
but protection.  When someone becomes *weaker* in a situation like <br/>
this, they sometimes need help.   If I am not comfortable with a <br/>
child, if I think he is harming my children then I will step in.  My <br/>
children will NOT play with them and I am honest to my children about <br/>
why.  There are times I reserve the right to play *parent*.  This <br/>
child is wounding your children&#39;s self-esteem far more than you would <br/>
be by intervening. You could also just call your children inside and <br/>
then go out and deal with him so it does not look like you are coming <br/>
in as your child&#39;s aide.  It sounds like Elliot may be afraid of <br/>
looking like a *baby* or *whimp* so he does not want you to get <br/>
involved, but sending an 8 yo to deal with a 13yo is not a fair <br/>
battle.  Good luck.<br/>
