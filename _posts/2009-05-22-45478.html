<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581149604">Hi;  I don&#39;t post often but read everyday.  I would like some ideas how to stay more connected to my teens . .. I&#39;m Ann, mom to three teens, twins age 16, and dd 15.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re on an opposite schedule these days (have been pretty much all year); all three stay up til 3, 4 or even 5 am and sleep most of the day.  I&#39;m naturally up around 6 and by the time they all get up, I&#39;m beginning to wind down.  I have set the alarm and gotten up from 1 am - 3 or so just to spend time with them . . . and  there are some events that they get up for; activities with their homeschooling co-op, or friends over, or travel or odd jobs.   More often than not, tho,  I&#39;m just not awake when they are.   <br/>
<br/>
 Things I do - have enough food to eat in the house,<br/>
strew magazines, interesting things on tables, bathroom, etc to find in the night, be sure they have cozy beds and alot of choices of where to sleep . . . be sure the wifi and xbox are working, games are current and not scratched . . . <br/>
<br/>
Our relationships are good, fun, kind and loving (thanks to this list) when we do hang out! but I have to admit I feel since I&#39;m not around them as much it&#39;s hard to strew, provide, be connected with what they&#39;re interested in . . . maybe this is all part of becoming their own people.   I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
Any one with teens with this experience?  I&#39;d like to do more to support them.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ann</div>

 </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t you change your schedule a little? The way you wrote it, seems <br/>
like maybe you have some reason? I stay up until midnight or 1 am most <br/>
nights. The kids stay up until maybe 2ish, usually. I get up a little <br/>
before they do, most days.<br/>
<br/>
Of course - these patterns change over time depending what activities <br/>
people are involved in....<br/>
