&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Just for the record, *sheltering* or *denial* are not in my <br/>
&gt; mind, but protecting and guiding are, especially because my dd is still<br/>
<br/>
&gt; very young.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My two are very young also. I don&#39;t believe that illicit sex, foul<br/>
language, violence, or indoctrination are a benefit to them. But, I am<br/>
not a hypocrite. I personally don&#39;t believe that they are a benefit to<br/>
anybody, so a movie of that nature is rarely, if ever, brought into my<br/>
house. This being so, the chances of them being subjected to them are<br/>
pretty slim. When they do perchance come across something I consider<br/>
questionable, we talk about why I choose not to have it on television.<br/>
For instance, if there is a political debate on, I tell them that<br/>
politicians tell an awful lot of lies, and that I choose not to listen to<br/>
lies. When they are old enough (meaning having more life experience) and<br/>
can discern the truth from the lies, they will be free to watch at their<br/>
whim. I feel that illicit sex can  desensitize a child to what a<br/>
meaningful, healthy relationship between life partners should really be<br/>
about, and IMO can lead to promiscuity. But I do think that what my<br/>
children see in my husband&#39;s and my own relationship will have more of an<br/>
impact than the occasional scene they may come across while switching<br/>
channels or what have you. Once, my 5dd saw an open mouthed kiss between<br/>
a couple. She asked, &quot;Mom, are they really kissing with their mouths<br/>
open?&quot; I told her yes they were. She replied, &quot;Don&#39;t they know they can<br/>
get germs that way?&quot;<br/>
No more explaining was needed. She just thought they should know better. <br/>
