&lt;&lt; I was pretty amazed when I googled on my name a couple of months ago. &lt;g&gt; I<br/>
write WAY too much on the web... ;)<br/>

NO you don&#39;t.<br/>
Do you have any things you especially like that I could put on the website?  <br/>
I think if there&#39;s a repository of peaceful, soothing, encouraging (yet <br/>
smart-ass and pointed) things people can get to they won&#39;t have to suffer the <br/>
possibility of witnessing an argument or seeing a slow day at <br/>
www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
The pace of acquiring information about unschooling is down from a year to <br/>
about half an hour now, with the internet and unschoolig.com.  So rather than <br/>
just tell them to get a patient life and that in the old days we had to wait <br/>
two months in the snow for Growing Without Schooling, and it could be read in <br/>
full before the baby woke up...   Now I&#39;ve just decided to give them QUALITY <br/>
quick-fix unschooling information!!  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good discussion this week on unschooling.com (the forum) where so<br/>
meone asked about not having time to spend with her kids because she has to <br/>
get the house clean first, and I suggested she spend as much time with her <br/>
kids as they would spend in school, and that spooked her, and there was some <br/>
dust and whimpering and then it turned really sweet and wonderful.  Anne O, <br/>
that show-off, helped as usual.<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  Speaking of Anne, in case there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s not at <br/>
unschooling-dotcom or unschooling.com (list or forum), here&#39;s something new:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That page is so far boring, but the three new articles (by Anne Ohman, Mary <br/>
Gold and Debbie Smith) are NOT boring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-305265664">I save bits of my homeschooling writing, but it&#39;s snippets, nothing coherent<br/>
enough for the masses. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look at it all sometime soon and if there&#39;s enough to glom together<br/>
into something sensible, I&#39;ll be happy to send it along.<br/>
