<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808916430">Unschooling is becoming known to some families in France because of  <br/>
the work of  Sylvie Martin-Rodriguez (who has been on this list  <br/>
before, as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eliott2@...">eliott2@...</a>) and<br/>
Catherine Dumonteil Kremer, who does a newsletter.  You can see some  <br/>
of their writings (and some are translations of English articles)  <br/>
here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/">http://www.webzinemaker.com/louves-online/</a><br/>
<br/>
****************************** Thank you Sandra. I&#39;m still here, always.. I read, I improve myself. If I couldn&#39;t read the unschooling lists.. pfff... it could be so difficult sometimes, in this country. <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say that our website &quot;louves-online&quot; is with Jeanine Barbé, who is on this list too, not with Catherine. Catherine has a blog for non violent education.<br/>
<br/>
Here, in France, yesterday, there was an unschooling family, who was at the court, because of the unschooling. They didn&#39;t hide, one of their children doesn&#39;t read at nine.. There is a trial (I&#39;m not sure about the good words)... <br/>
<br/>
pfff.. I wish I could leave in an other country... <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone on the unschooling lists, because reading all of you changed our lives. <br/>
<br/>
I wish to contribute more but I just can learn everyday from your posts.. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so sorry!  I didn&#39;t mean to slight Jeanine, who has translated  <br/>
some of the articles too.  There are articles there by Danielle  <br/>
Conger and Anne Ohman and me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sorry to hear someone had legal trouble.  Unschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
flat out legal at all, here or anywhere, meaning you can&#39;t just say  <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re unschoolers so we don&#39;t have to follow your laws.&quot;   <br/>
Unschoolers need to understand homeschooling, unschooling and  <br/>
learning enough to speak of it in terms of whatever laws are in  <br/>
effect where they are.   That&#39;s why it is important at some level to  <br/>
be analytical about what your kids are learning and how, but that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean we have to tell the kids &quot;this was science and math,&quot; it  <br/>
just means the parents need to try to be aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of discussions in which people said strewing  <br/>
was manipulative and sneaky.   I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  If I  <br/>
know what kinds of things my children could use being exposed to to  <br/>
be more well rounded, or to &quot;fill in gaps&quot; in what they know, or to  <br/>
take them to another level of understanding, bringing those things up  <br/>
in physical or conversational ways is no more &quot;manipulative&quot; than  <br/>
bringing more fruit into the house if there hasn&#39;t been much fruit  <br/>
consumption lately, or bringing them bottles of water on hot summer  <br/>
days.  I don&#39;t need to force them to eat oranges or drink water, but  <br/>
I can notice it might be good for them and make it appealing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people say &quot;We&#39;re not homeschooling, we&#39;re unschooling,&quot; but if  <br/>
legally one&#39;s choices are school enrollment or homeschooling, at that  <br/>
point, in that light, they are either homeschooling or truant.   <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t *just* a method of homeschooling when people change  <br/>
their entire parenting philosophies to make it work so deeply, but it  <br/>
is a method of homeschooling when they understand it as an  <br/>
alternative to school.    They need to be actively involved in things  <br/>
that bring their children into the world, and the world into their  <br/>
children.  The best unschoolers are doing more with and for their  <br/>
children than school-at-home families are.  Unschooling parents need  <br/>
to understand MORE about how learning works and keep their family  <br/>
lives rich.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well it&#39;s not illegal not to read; lots of kids that age aren&#39;t  <br/>
reading well in school, and they have the report cards full of &quot;F&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;D&quot; (or the alternate equivalents) to prove it, but the schools  <br/>
blame the kids for not working hard, paying attention, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What is illegal, in some states (our laws aren&#39;t federal/national,  <br/>
but are state to state, and I think in Canada are province by  <br/>
province), is not even starting to teach the kids to read.  But when  <br/>
a parent really understands unschooling and natural learning, or even  <br/>
knows what schools call &quot;reading readiness,&quot; they can see that other  <br/>
things are parts of learning to read too.  Sequencing (readily  <br/>
available in storytelling, discussing movie plots, playing games) and  <br/>
knowing letters&#39; names and sounds (which can happen with playing  <br/>
around, and doesn&#39;t need to involve methodical worksheet use or  <br/>
anything).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I thought in several states, you can wait for your children being  <br/>

<br/>
Some states have no testing requirements.<br/>
Some have testing requirements but the scores don&#39;t have to be shown  <br/>
to any officials.<br/>
Some have testing requirements but the scores don&#39;t affect one&#39;s  <br/>
right to continue to homeschool<br/>
I think a couple have a requirement that if a child is below the 15th  <br/>
percentile or some such (something low) that the child is supposed to  <br/>
be put into school.  Or maybe one state.  (anyone know?)<br/>
<br/>
The lack of pressure has to be defended by the family, meaning there  <br/>
can always be pressure from in-laws or neighbors, but the parents  <br/>
have to be confident enough to protect the child from pressure with  <br/>
their own confidence in what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Often the pressure comes from the parents themselves and their fear  <br/>
of what others will say or do.<br/>
<br/>
It helps for them to know other unschoolers in person when possible,  <br/>
and see kids older than theirs making natural progress.  It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
go on a long smooth curve as school pretends learning goes (when they  <br/>
average it all out and build a curriculum to &quot;support&quot; the curve).   <br/>
It goes in bursts and starts, with periods of quiet between.  So does  <br/>
the learning of any individual child in school, but it doesn&#39;t show  <br/>
because the report cards come on a schedule, and the semesters and  <br/>
school years go by the calendar.<br/>
<br/>
The confidence of unschooling parents needs to come from their own  <br/>
deep understanding of what they want to accomplish and why.  It&#39;s  <br/>
harder than buying a curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071521353">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers so we don&#39;t have to follow your laws.&quot;   <br/>
Unschoolers need to understand homeschooling, unschooling and  <br/>
learning enough to speak of it in terms of whatever laws are in  <br/>
effect where they are.  <br/>
******************** Yes, I&#39;m not sure I understand everything you wanted to<br/>
say.<br/>
 <br/>
When I read the unschooling lists, I see lot of children who don&#39;t read at 9<br/>
or 10, and I thought it was legal in the US ?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The legality varies in every State here, but generally has to do with &quot;being<br/>
enrolled&quot;, or the content of courses &quot;offered&quot;, and in some States *taking*<br/>
(*sitting for* as against passing) standardized tests or portfolio reviews -<br/>
rather than an assessment of how much has been learnt at any particular<br/>
time. The standard of portfolio assessment is usually &quot;Showing Progress&quot;<br/>
rather than an absolute stage of competence. Some states are tougher than<br/>
others in terms of how hard ass the assessor (if any) might be about a child<br/>
not *yet* reading fluently.<br/>
 <br/>
Many people Unschooling in US states that have assessments and testing go<br/>
through a kind of split personality double think process around the time of<br/>
assessments.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the time &quot;they&quot; just don&#39;t want to take someone to court over an<br/>
issue that so many of the public schools are demonstrably failing at also,<br/>
such as reading levels.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, if someone is being pressured by a State official, they can<br/>
move to another State and comply with the Attendance Laws there.<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if there are statistics available for the French schools about<br/>
the ages of reading fluency and comprehension. I just can&#39;t believe that<br/>
every French schooled child would be reading fluently and fully by 9 if<br/>
every American, Australian, English and Canadian child is not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Here it&#39;s not at all. Children can show lot of things they know to the<br/>
inspectors, they can have interests in everything, they can be happy,<br/>
joyfull, everything, if they don&#39;t know how to read at 7 or 8, it&#39;s simply<br/>
not possible. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the US, one of ways laws are changed is through the Judicial process -<br/>
the Judges&#39; interpretation become the precedents for the law. Sometimes<br/>
legislation passed by the representative governing bodies is challenged in<br/>
the courts, and gets overturned because of a higher responsibility to<br/>
interpret the Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
What is the worst outcome? Would they have to institute a reading program in<br/>
their homeschool? Would they be forced to engage in remedial reading lessons<br/>
through a tutor? Would they be forced to send their child to school until he<br/>
was able to demonstrate reading ability? Or would their child be removed<br/>
from their custody?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is worth saying to your child, especially an older one, &quot;We can<br/>
keep these folk of our backs and comply with the law if you do a few of<br/>
these worksheets. Would you be willing to sit down sometime for a hour and<br/>
I&#39;ll help you if you want?&quot; I should think saying that would be better than<br/>
going to court if the risk was losing your child. <br/>
<br/>
I guess parents might view saying &quot;let&#39;s work on your reading&quot; in some way<br/>
as compromising one&#39;s integrity and ethics. They might see it as<br/>
unacceptable, and be willing risk whatever the consequences are. I would<br/>
hope that the child involved is mature enough to have a real understanding<br/>
of what is being risked, and a real ability to consent to be a heroic figure<br/>
in the struggle for Unschooling rights. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is worth moving to another place. Whenever James starts<br/>
rumbling about moving somewhere else, the first thing I do is go online and<br/>
look up the homeschooling regulations. Some places are going to be vetoed<br/>
just on that alone. Although James&#39; pov is that he has enough faith in Jayn,<br/>
that he feels we could do whatever was needed to comply with the law and<br/>
still Unschool. He has no fears that she would be seen as inadequate in any<br/>
way. My fears are more along the lines of how she might be emotionally<br/>
harmed by testing etc and how I could mitigate that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Years back there was a family (not unschoolers) who went to court  <br/>
over homeschooling and their children were taken away and (I think)  <br/>
the mom was put in jail for a while, and they seemed happy about it,  <br/>
in that they were practicing civil disobedience and making their  <br/>
point and getting publicity.  I can&#39;t imagine, for myself, that it  <br/>
would be worth losing one&#39;s children over at all. Not even for a  <br/>
week.  There are other ways to make a point.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But that&#39;s why integrity and ethics need to include principle and  <br/>
priorities.  My &quot;ethics&quot; take a back seat to my desire for my  <br/>
children to be safe and happy.  So far, I haven&#39;t had to make a  <br/>
choice between those things, but I wouldn&#39;t think long if one of my  <br/>
children was about to be taken away from me.  I would compromise the  <br/>
HECK out of life to keep that child with me.  If I had to have my  <br/>
kids in public school to keep them, they&#39;d be in school today.   <br/>
Because I DO have a choice, then I make the choice that goes toward  <br/>
keeping them with me, which is that they don&#39;t go to school.  And I  <br/>
make the choice that goes toward natural learning and the maintenance  <br/>
of their curiosity, which is to help them discover the world in fun  <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly was in the hot tub with me and Keith.  That tub has  <br/>
been good for incidental conversations.  Wednesday night it was us  <br/>
and Marty, talking about college and U.S. Savings Bonds and such.   <br/>
Thursday it was Holly, telling me how glad she was that I had shown  <br/>
her &quot;view source&quot; for webpages, because she had found some good  <br/>
backgrounds and codes, for her My Space page.  We talked about the  <br/>
legalities, courtesies and ethics of using other art and codes, and  <br/>
how to credit people, and how to lift public domain art onto her own  <br/>
computer and then upload it from there.  We didn&#39;t plan that, and  <br/>
couldn&#39;t have, and it was great.<br/>

<br/>
I stand by that.  If Holly gets busted here in her final years and  <br/>
the state demands she be tested, I&#39;ll just recommend that she make a  <br/>
pattern with the numbers and walk away whistling happily.  Kirby is  <br/>
past the age of compulsory attendance.  Marty, at 17, is working full  <br/>
time, which is a kind of twilight zone.  It&#39;s one of the requirements  <br/>
for being allowed to drop out of school, and so I could say he&#39;s  <br/>
finished with school, or I could say he&#39;s doing a project on trades  <br/>
and vocations.  I&#39;m just not worried about it.   He&#39;s reportedly one  <br/>
of the best workers there, and the lady in charge of the deli section  <br/>
has been chatting him up, but when she found he wasn&#39;t 18 she was  <br/>
disappointed, he said.  She said he was always cheerful, and he  <br/>
should come and work in the deli when he&#39;s older.<br/>

In Virginia it is 23%, and if they fail to meet that, then there is a<br/>
year of probation and retesting.<br/>
<br/>
However, Virginia also offers other options to testing, such as<br/>
evaluations, submitting a portfolio for approval (which usually means<br/>
meeting the SOLs in english and math),  or filing for Religious<br/>
Exemption which means you are completely free of all homeschooling<br/>
laws once approved, but requires proving to the school board that your<br/>
convictions are religiously based and genuine.<br/>

I was quite relieved when my first child learned to read at about 6.  People <br/>
who knew nothing about the details of our homeschool life, except that we <br/>
homeschooled, made comments to me about what a good job I was doing <br/>
homeschooling.  They assumed that because Lisa could read, I had taught her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my &quot;late&quot; reader came second, and not first.  I have more <br/>
confidence and knowledge now.  I worked to protect her from those who <br/>
thought she should be reading and avoided the issue as much as possible with <br/>
those who might see me as a &quot;bad&quot; homeschooler because my child didn&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
She took off with reading at 10 1/2, which is still early compared to some. <br/>

Have any of your articles been translated into German? I&#39;ve been <br/>

I know can&#39;t understand English well enough to read the articles in <br/>

think &quot;Oh, Sandra Dodd addressed just that&quot; and have to try and <br/>

emotional harm that could be done by testing (we live in Georgia-- <br/>
kids must be tested every 3 years starting in 3rd grade, but we don&#39;t  <br/>
have to turn the tests in).  He says Shelby (7) will be fine.  And I  <br/>
worry about what&#39;s going to happen if she&#39;s not reading in 2 years  <br/>
when we&#39;re supposed to test.  She&#39;s *slowly* putting the reading  <br/>
puzzle together, but it&#39;s just not important to her yet.  Playing  <br/>
with Barbies and Fashion Pollies is *much* more deserving of her  <br/>
time.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773732818">Dear Sandra<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been away for a while so I&#39;m way behind, but I wanted to <br/>
respond to this. I didn&#39;t realise you didn&#39;t know about unschoolers <br/>
in Germany, as it was a link from your page that led me to a German <br/>
unschooling site (www.unschooling.de). If you look on that page, <br/>
you&#39;ll see that Clonlara school has started a subsidiary for <br/>
unschoolers in Germany, which has been well received. Stefanie <br/>
Mohsennia, who runs the site to which I referred, has written the <br/>
first book in German about unschooling, which is also on that page. <br/>
There is also an organisation, called the Bundesverband Natürlich <br/>
Lernen (www.bvnl.de)and the Initiative für Selbstbestimmtes Lernen <br/>
(Initiative for self-driven learning is the closest translation I <br/>
can think of). Together the BVNL and the Initiative organise <br/>
regional and national meetings and an annual summer camp, with the <br/>
attendance growing apace.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that because of the HSLDA, the German-Russian Baptists <br/>
were well publicised, but there are a horde of other homeschoolers <br/>
across the whole continuum. So far the unofficial figures that I <br/>
have heard of range up to about 1000 homeschooled children.<br/>
<br/>
In the last two years, the BVNL has organised a meeting for <br/>
homeschooling experts (which includes parents, lawyers, philosophers <br/>
and anyone interested in the issue of freedom in education). As you <br/>
can imagine, with such a wide range, from those homeschooling mainly <br/>
for religious reasons to children&#39;s rights activists who are <br/>
skeptical about homeschooling and rather want to make all schools <br/>
democratic, a la Summerhill, there were many heated discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers of all ilks continue to be persecuted (and prosecuted) <br/>
by the authorities, although many are able to slide under the radar, <br/>
like us at present. I expect that to change soon, as there is a new <br/>
law that all immigrant children who are due to start school in the <br/>
following year must have their level of German tested and sent to <br/>
German classes. This means that our five year old will soon be <br/>
coming to the notice of the local school, who gave us problems 2 <br/>
years ago about our daughter (which stopped when we said we were <br/>
moving away, but we didn&#39;t tell them when dh&#39;s contract was <br/>
exteended). I was at the court case of a fellow unschooling mother a <br/>
few weeks back and the judge was quite sympathetic but had now <br/>
choice but to impose a fine, given the current state of the law.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the Teenage Liberation Handbook is going to be published in <br/>
German, hopefully by winter. Now that is something I would love to <br/>
get into every library in Germany.<br/>

the same position as the religious ones. Actually, it&#39;s worse I think, <br/>
because the authorities will have more sympathy for a family that is <br/>
strictly following the state curriculum than for one that is following <br/>
