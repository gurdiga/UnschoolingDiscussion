<div id="ygrps-yiv-546929802">Dh and I are both Caucasian.  1st birth was cesarean due to CPD (hmm,<br/>
5:30 am Saturday - wonder if the doc wanted to rest a bit before his<br/>
tee-time?)  DD&#39;s head size at birth was 90th percentile and my pelvic<br/>
bones did not spread during pregnancy.  She was 7 1/2 #&#39;s.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
until she was about a year and I started reading on the subject that I<br/>
realized her head was so big because it didn&#39;t have to squeeze through<br/>
the birth canal.  I switched to a midwife for #2.  She had me send for<br/>
the records and said it wasn&#39;t CPD and my pelvis was normal, etc.  She<br/>
said at best you could call it &quot;failure to progress&quot;, which at least was<br/>
true from the doc&#39;s point of view - failure to meet his timeline.  #2 was<br/>
VBAC and one of my proudest moments, yeah!  I had her in the hospital<br/>
(I&#39;m envious of those home births, but that&#39;s another story) and had to<br/>
sign that I was willing to risk death for my refusal to have a heparin<br/>
lock during labor.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, cesareans can be a miracle, but I&#39;m sure mine was not medically<br/>
necessary.<br/>

<br/>
I have the same exact story as yours. Second child was C-section due <br/>
to CPD, supposedly. It was also Friday night of Memorial Weekend and<br/>
I <br/>
was the only patient my doc had in the hospital --- he must have had <br/>
plans. I was HARDLY in labor at the time! I also had Group B  <br/>
Strep (although it was treated) and my doc used that to scare me a<br/>
get <br/>
me to say OK to the C-section. That was 9 years ago. <br/>
<br/>
This past January, I had successful VBAC, using a midwife, and had a <br/>
9lb. 7 ounce boy! Labor was long, but I only pushed for 15 minutes. <br/>
Would someone with too small of a pelvis be able to do that? Makes<br/>
one <br/>
wonder ...<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with getting a hep lock, by the way?<br/>
