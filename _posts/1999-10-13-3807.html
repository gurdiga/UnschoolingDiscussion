<br/>
ok, does this mean you have found a way to positively explain your hsing <br/>
style?  it always depends on who i am talking to, how i edit what i say!  but <br/>
i lean heavily on the philosophy end of things, for that is from where i make <br/>
these decisions anyway.  i never thought of it as shy so much as avoiding <br/>
discomfort for myself and others!  but i also dont want to miss sharing the <br/>
wonderful world of unschooling with someone who might be &quot;dying&quot; in their <br/>
chosen structure.  i know it is my freedom to choose to share or not, i guess <br/>
i just need to keep building my confidence and realize nothing is perfect and <br/>
not worry about giving homeschooling a bad name!  i have heard the same <br/>
comments as you have... but i wonder, if the unschoolers we meet are few and <br/>
far between, who have they met?  perhaps no-one.  we can be the first <br/>
unschoolers that they come to know and it might eventually give it a good <br/>
name in their eyes! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m working on this all the time but yes, I&#39;m getting more and more focused<br/>
on what our style is and why it is developing in this fashion.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it always depends on who i am talking to, how i edit what i say!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a person has to be aware of who they are talking to and what their<br/>
position is in hsing, whether or not they are having difficulties with<br/>
their chosen route, etc. If we didn&#39;t we would alienate people right and left.<br/>
<br/>
    i never thought of it as shy so much as avoiding <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;discomfort for myself and others! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been a while but if I remember right I was being sarcastic.  My<br/>
experience with folks around here is shy is something they are not - rather<br/>
they tend to be a bit more on the judgemental side.  That is something that<br/>
really bothers me.  I love my support group because they are accepting of<br/>
folks from all walks of life, all religions or not, and all hsing styles.<br/>
So when I run into folks that think that school at home is the only sound<br/>
morale, spiritual way to go it really steams me up.  I&#39;ve run into several<br/>
like that.  I am probably more judgemental than I think at times as well.<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be but some can be so negative about my choices that I can<br/>
fall into defending myself and my choices to them if I&#39;m not careful.<br/>
<br/>
 but i also don&#39;t want to miss sharing the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wonderful world of unschooling with someone who might be &quot;dying&quot; in their <br/>
&gt;chosen structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to miss this either.  I was actually going to have a new hser<br/>
over tomorrow to discuss just this - how to overcome the drudgery of the<br/>
workbook/school at home approach.  Although I don&#39;t claim to be an<br/>
unschooling expert (far from it!) I do know many resources to contact (like<br/>
this list) and can share the new things I&#39;ve learned to do.  Unfortunately,<br/>
I will not be able to do this as I had to admit my dh into the hospital<br/>
this evening.  I will most probably disappear here on the list for a few<br/>
more days.  Sigh.  :o(  DH will be fine, just needs some tests that will<br/>
put us in touch with the right drugs he needs.<br/>
<br/>
 i have heard the same <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;comments as you have... but i wonder, if the unschoolers we meet are few and <br/>
&gt;far between, who have they met?  perhaps no-one.  we can be the first <br/>

&gt;name in their eyes! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Erin I think you have it right - either no one or someone that just rubbed<br/>
them the wrong way in the first place.  So many SAHers are part of support<br/>
groups that simply denounce unschooling as being anything but hsing.  And<br/>
many of these people don&#39;t have a clue what unschooling actually is.  Met<br/>
one the other day that basically unschooled through 4th grade and then<br/>
SAH&#39;d the rest of the way (her son is now 17) and she really doesn&#39;t even<br/>
realize that is what she did!  I think she would be offended if I told her<br/>
she was an unschooler to start off with.  :-P  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, like I said I&#39;m going to disappear for a day or two more - I soon<br/>
hope to be back in the groove of keeping up with my email lists - sorry for<br/>
popping in and out so.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great week!<br/>
