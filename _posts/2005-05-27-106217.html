<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119305545">Star Wars fans may be amused by this short animated film.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(Grocery) Store Wars&quot; <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.storewars.org/flash/">http://www.storewars.org/flash/</a><br/>
<br/>
Gabriel (8yo), who is currently dressed all in black and menacing our<br/>
living room with his light saber, has had lots of fun with it. He and<br/>
his friends have been coming up with some great new characters based<br/>
on this--Darth Gatorade, Cake Windu, R-2 Beer-2, Ar-2-ti-choke, and of<br/>
course, his favorite, Puke Skywalker. My favorite line is &quot;search your<br/>
peelings, Luke&quot;. It&#39;s a bit preachy about organic foods, although less<br/>
so than &quot;The Meatrix&quot; on the same site.<br/>
<br/>
Another clever fan film that we&#39;ve found: &quot;Troops&quot; (a take on Cops,<br/>
with Imperial Storm Troopers) at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theforce.net/fanfilms/shortfilms/troops/">http://www.theforce.net/fanfilms/shortfilms/troops/</a><br/>
There are other shorts at that site, though we haven&#39;t checked any of<br/>
them out yet.<br/>
<br/>
May the Force be with you,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826986204">Have you also seen Thumb Wars? - turn to the nail side of the force!<br/>
lol. DH found a site that had tons of fanfic film/video, some outright <br/>
silly and some interesting back-story type pieces. I&#39;m not sure what <br/>
the site is.</div>
