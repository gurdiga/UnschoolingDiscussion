<h4>Q</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841931058">I can totally empathize with this. I&#39;m Caucasian, my husband is Japanese,<br/>
and our son is just plain adorable (LOL, no I&#39;m not biased). When I&#39;m in the<br/>
U.S. visiting, people ask me where I adopted him from if my husband isn&#39;t<br/>
with me. In Japan, people often say he looks like a gaijin (foreigner,<br/>
alien). They usually say this in a positive context, as in &quot;Gaijin kids are<br/>
just sooooo cute!&quot; and are taken aback when my response is a cold, &quot;He isn&#39;t<br/>
a gaijin, he has a Japanese passport just like you.&quot;<br/>
People really can be insensitive, it really is just that they speak without<br/>
thinking of the effect their words have.<br/>
