<br/>
I have to wonder whether they were actually shot in Hawaii or just around<br/>
Los Angeles and Malibu. Probably a mixture of both. &quot;CSI Miami&quot; is shot here<br/>
in LA; the sound stages for interiors are just down the street in Manhattan<br/>
Beach and they shoot most of their exteriors in Venice and environs, with<br/>
the occasional &quot;money shot&quot; from Miami. &quot;ER&quot;, set in Chicago, is shot in LA.<br/>
They take the relevant characters to Chicago for a few days/nights every<br/>
couple of months and shoot a bunch of exteriors for multiple episodes.<br/>
<br/>
A movie I designed called &quot;True Friends&quot; is set in Brooklyn and was shot<br/>
here too except for some key establishing exteriors. I spent most of my time<br/>
trying to find ways to hide distant palm trees, since we weren&#39;t of the<br/>
budget to use CGI to remove and problem visual elements. <br/>
<br/>
James was working second unit on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. They have their own<br/>
water bottles for the cast and crew&#39;s use with their logo/cast picture<br/>
printed on the label.<br/>
<br/>
Trivia, trivia, trivia....<br/>

NOT Malibu, definitely not.<br/>
Much helicopter view.<br/>
<br/>
Hawaii was only recently a state, and good color movies were fairly new, and <br/>
Blue Hawaii was a big deal even for those who weren&#39;t Elvis fans.   <br/>
