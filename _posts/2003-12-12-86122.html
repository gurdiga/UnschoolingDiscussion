&gt; having fun with is that her first name came from a famous Broadway <br/>
&gt; composer-choreographer, while her middle name was given in honor of the Wizard of Oz <br/>

Both of the name stories above refer to men, yet her full name sounds <br/>
feminine and not particularly unusual. Huh!<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s regional.  My parents were from small town Texas and <br/>
southern New Mexico and were big on truthfulness.  I don&#39;t mind stories for <br/>
entertainment value, but when they&#39;re passed off as truth I&#39;m not having fun anymore.<br/>
