<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212815973">**i just wondered what other parents did or thought about children playing <br/>
with guns. not real guns, but toy guns. we had a no gun rule then my son <br/>
turned <br/>
everything into a gun and so it turned into a don&#39;t point it at anyone rule.**<br/>
<br/>
I managed to maintain a virtual ban on guns and gun play for two decades of <br/>
parenting. Then came mister superpersistant, the magical constructo boy who <br/>
can and did turn literally anything into a gun. So the rule was, don&#39;t point <br/>
your knex or toast or origami gun at me or anyone else who hasn&#39;t agreed to <br/>
play. Then came the day two years ago, on a shopping trip to spend his <br/>
birthday money from grandma, that he stood sighing in front of the cap gun <br/>
display saying &quot;I don&#39;t suppose there&#39;s any chance you&#39;re going to let me <br/>
spend my money on one of these, is there?&quot; He came home with a bright red cap <br/>
pistol. No pointing or firing at anyone without their current permission, and <br/>
clean up after yourself. Not so surprisingly, his gun play decreased <br/>
dramatically after the first month and has never returned to it&#39;s former <br/>
obsession.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d had a kid who desired it that much earlier, I wouldn&#39;t have held out <br/>
so long I&#39;m sure. His elder brother channeled his cold steel lusts onto war <br/>
planes though, and his sister wasn&#39;t a weapons type, so.....  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459239941">We have a no toy guns rule in our house. We have real guns. Our son has<br/>
been out to the range and seen what a real gun can do. In fact, making<br/>
pumpkin lace is a big deal every fall. He&#39;s dry fired the sig, and when<br/>
he&#39;s a little bigger, he&#39;ll be firing with the rest of us.<br/>
