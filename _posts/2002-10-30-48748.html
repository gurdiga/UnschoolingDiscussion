I know a couple of women who fit that description exactly.  They don&#39;t want a <br/>
relationship with a man.  They just want that momentary thing.<br/>
<br/>
And there was research in the past few years (maybe even last year) about the <br/>
effect of sperm on women.  Seriously.  Pretty soon they&#39;ll probably be <br/>
selling it in Jergen&#39;s lotion or something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have heard, but don&#39;t know how true this is, that women who have a <br/>
monogamous relationship and have regular sex have a lesser chance of cervical <br/>
cancer than women who have multiple partners. I have also heard that sex with <br/>
a partner that isn&#39;t circumcised increases the chance of cervical cancer. I <br/>
don&#39;t put much stock in that one though. Sperm, actually semen, has proteins <br/>
that are good for you, in ways I don&#39;t know much about. Although some women <br/>
are allergic to something in the semen. It causes yeast infections. Also, <br/>
during pregnancy when your hormones are in overdrive and some are decreased <br/>
significantly, semen can react differently with your body. All four times I <br/>
was pregnant, Darin had to use a condom if we had sex because I got horrible <br/>
yeast infections if he didn&#39;t. (too much info? sorry)  <br/>

<br/>
I just read something fascinating in a recent issue of U.S. News and<br/>
World Report.  Studies are showing that women are less likely to have<br/>
pregnancy complications like eclampsia, if they&#39;ve been having sex with<br/>
the man for a year or more prior to becoming pregnant.  The theory is<br/>
that it takes time for the woman&#39;s immune system to adjust to the man&#39;s<br/>
sperm and not reject it.  <br/>

multiple partners. And I think because multiple partners increases the risk <br/>
of disease, it stands to reason why it would also increase the risk of <br/>
cancer.  <br/>

Herpes is a result of the Herpes Simplex Virus. There are two forms I and II<br/>
I is coldsores around the mouth. Most of the population has that virus, <br/>
Herpes II is genital herpes. As with HPV, it is forever. Some may have an <br/>
outbreak once in their entire lives and never show it again. Others suffer <br/>
with outbreaks several times a year for their life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are human pappiloma virus and herpes the same thing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tuck<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. How to explain this? HPV is a generic term that more than 60 viruses fall <br/>
under. They are responsible for warts anywhere on the body. Although only <br/>
some are sexually transmitted. (genital or venereal warts) You can treat, but <br/>
not cure them. Some people (25-35%?) get the visual sign of warts, but many <br/>
never show the wart symptom. Some believe that it is the subclinical versions <br/>
that are linked to cancer. That is why pap smears are so important. The warts <br/>
appear on the vulva, in or around the vagina, anus, on the cervix, anywhere <br/>
on the groin and thighs, and sometimes in the mouth. (penis and scrotum for <br/>
men) The warts can be raised or flat, small or large, single or clumped in a <br/>
group. (look like a little head of cauliflower) Normally they are <br/>
flesh-colored and painless. (also pinkish or gray) Spread by skin to skin <br/>
contact, interring through tiny breaks in the skin. Once you get it, it could <br/>
take months or years for it to come back to the surface, if at all. There is <br/>
no blood test for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) is part of the family of viruses that causes chicken <br/>
pox, shingles, and infectious mononucleosis. HSV-1 is what causes cold sores, <br/>
fever blisters and the like. It can be the cause of sores in the genital <br/>
area, but usually those are caused by HSV-2. There is no cure, but there are <br/>
drugs to treat a breakout. The virus lives in nerve cells at the base of the <br/>
spine and creeps to the surface once in a while. The outbreak looks like <br/>
blisters. Most people who have the disease don&#39;t even know it because they <br/>
have no symptoms. It is thought that some 20% of genital herpes is spread by <br/>
oral sex. (that is a person can have genital herpes in the mouth, just like <br/>
they can have the HSV-1 in the genitals) There is a blood test for herpes. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis, and chancroid, neither is a <br/>
reportable disease, so if you have it, either you or your doctor will (or <br/>
won&#39;t) discover it. You won&#39;t be getting calls from the health department. <br/>
<br/>
Herpes looks like blisters, and HPV looks like warts. <br/>

i believe that&#39;s true. Also, a woman who is pregnant in a relationship which has been monogamous for at least a year before conception and who has regular monogamous sex, is much less likely to lose that baby due to miscarriage, than a woman with more sex partners before and after conception.<br/>
As for the cirumcision study, I believe it was flawed but can&#39;t remember why--perhaps you&#39;ll find it refuted on a no-circ site?<br/>
What is sure, in my experience at least, is that an intact male has the potential for giving and recieiving pleasure much more sensitive than a circed man.<br/>

<br/>
There should be a mucus membrane situation going on, but when the foreskin is <br/>
removed, the end of the penis becomes more like palm-of-hand skin.  Still <br/>
sensitive, but not quite the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read quite a bit about this.  My first real sex partner was <br/>
uncircumcised.  That was nearly four years of relations.  I didn&#39;t have a <br/>
basis for comparison.  The first time hurt him a bit, and it bled, a bit.  <br/>
The skin hadn&#39;t ever been pulled fully back that way.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve read is that it&#39;s possible that routine circumcision is a <br/>
contributing cause to men having and fantasizing about rougher sex, because <br/>
really gentle sex doesn&#39;t work as well for circumcised men as for <br/>
uncircumcised.<br/>

So do circumcised, but it&#39;s more likely to get lost than if the foreskin was <br/>
there to catch and redistribute it.  <br/>

I&#39;ve had quite a few of both and have never seen any difference in my <br/>
pleasure according to whether they were intact or not. Big difference on how <br/>
they would be pleased but nothing the other way around. It depended on the <br/>
guy, not what was (or wasn&#39;t) in his pants!!<br/>

whereas Jeff&#39;s is brown, is this going to cause him to feel bad? Or<br/>
what if he had blue eyes instead of brown like his dad&#39;s. There<br/>
are so many ways that boys are different from their fathers, why<br/>
do people feel that having penises that look different will cause<br/>
emotional damage?<br/>
<br/>
That said, we did circ Jason, mainly because Jeff was. However, by<br/>
the time Kyle was born I had looked into it more and decided that<br/>
there was no real reason to do it and just could not see putting <br/>
him through the pain. I did leave the ultimate decision up to Jeff<br/>
but made sure that he knew exactly why and where I stood on the issue.<br/>
So we have one circed and one not. There has been only one time that <br/>
Jason asked me about Kyle&#39;s foreskin and that was when Kyle went through <br/>
a period of fascination with his penis (I think that the foreskin was <br/>
loosening because it was the first time that the glens came out of the <br/>
foreskin). I explained to Jason that he was circumcised and so he did not <br/>
have a foreskin whereas Kyle did. It has never been an issue...just another<br/>
way that they are different, like Jason has curlier hair then Kyle etc.<br/>
<br/>
The circ rate is lower then it used to be, so I think that there is a much<br/>
bigger chance of having intact and circed penises in locker rooms, so <br/>
hopefully Kyle will never have to feel different. I actually worry more about<br/>
Jason some day asking why we had his cut off....<br/>
