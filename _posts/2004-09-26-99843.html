Since there has been an amazingly articulate and thought-provoking<br/>
TV debate going on, I just thought I&#39;d mention that the role of<br/>
technology/media in unschooling is one of the upcoming themes for<br/>
the December issue of Live Free Learn Free. (The other is<br/>
unschooling and activism.)  Here&#39;s the description from the website:<br/>
<br/>
The role of technology/media in unschooling: This has become a hot-<br/>
button issue in the home education community. We&#39;re looking for<br/>
articles that are non-reactionary. Just let us know about your<br/>
family. Are you comfortable with the use of technology in your home?<br/>
Why or why not? What are the benefits and drawbacks? Has your home<br/>
undergone a change in the use of technology? What were the results?<br/>
Whether it&#39;s TV or computers or video games, it seems everyone has<br/>
an opinion, and everyone has a story. Tell us!<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in contributing, you can visit our website<br/>
(www.livefreelearnfree.com) for more detailed submission<br/>
information.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
