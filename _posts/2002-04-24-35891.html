really curious. :o)) My daughter has always been unschooled and learned to <br/>
read in what I guess would be called a whole language approach. She was <br/>
surrounded by language (written and spoken). We read to and with her, <br/>
answered her questions, played games, etc. No formal lessons of any kind. <br/>
She&#39;s 8 and a pretty good reader by most standards, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Her spelling also improves every day. She&#39;s doing this by real life writing. <br/>
Letters to friends, stories, poems, labels, charts, etc. Sometimes she asks <br/>
me for spellings and I&#39;ll throw in a helpful phonics rule. Lots of times <br/>
I&#39;ll just spell the word for her. Other times she knows instinctively or <br/>
something how to get to a correct spelling.I haven&#39;t seen any negative <br/>
spelling effects for her based on how she learned to read.<br/>
<br/>
My son *does* have trouble with spelling and sounding out words. But he was <br/>
the one who got more phonics in his life. I also wouldn&#39;t blame phonics for <br/>
his difficulties, though. It think it has more to do with how his brain <br/>
works. He&#39;s a big-picture thinker and gobbles up entire paragraphs without <br/>
worrying about the details of one or two words. Works for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217202765"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I remember reading once that this rule is &quot;not&quot; true more often<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than it &quot;is&quot; <br/>
true. Does anyone know...is this true? ;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 <br/>

 <br/>
Hrm:o) &quot;Helpful&quot; is an excellent choice of wording. :O) I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to by coy.<br/>
But if you merely spell the word for her how can she be independent in<br/>
the future by knowing how to spell it herself because of a rule that she<br/>
knows and then branching off into other words herself WITHOUT your<br/>
input, unless needed. I think it would be frustrating to see a trend but<br/>
not have it given to me fully what the method is, which would save<br/>
plenty of time and energy. IMVHO. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m asking this meekly, &quot;How can my children learn the consistency of<br/>
spelling rules if I dont teach them to them.&quot; Also; &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
easier to just find a system that works and teach it to them for clarity<br/>
of focus?&quot; At their own pace of course.<br/>
 <br/>
My reasoning right now is that I&#39;m grateful for the ones that went<br/>
before me and produced something I can use to teach this to my children<br/>
since Im not in a position in my life to research and develop for them.<br/>
Someone has kindly done it for me. :O) <br/>
 <br/>
Please understand that the system I&#39;m referring to does NOT give<br/>
redundant writing exercises and lists of spelling words to copy out. If<br/>
my child knows what &quot;ull&quot; sounds as in the word, &quot;gull&quot; then he has<br/>
captured the sound and I will not teach &quot;full&quot; &quot;pull&quot; &quot;skull&quot; and blah<br/>
blah blah. However, if my child knows what &quot;ull&quot; sounds like, he can<br/>
then create those words by himself in the future, and more like them!<br/>
With the knowledge of handy &quot;rules&quot; to spelling he has a guide to go by<br/>
and can hit the target more readily and I think that fosters<br/>
independence, motivation and confidence in conquering the English<br/>
language. :O) &lt;phew!&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Moving on....... :o) Your so kind to entertain my thoughts as I ponder!<br/>
:O)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
THE RULE IS TRUE.<br/>
 <br/>
(Hope it doesn&#39;t bore anyone! :O) I find it neato though!)<br/>
 <br/>
The Always ei rule:<br/>
 <br/>
Every key word in the following sentence uses the ei phonogram<br/>
regardless of its sound.<br/>
 <br/>
*Neither the counterfeit heifer nor her protein was seized by the weird<br/>
foreign sovereign who did not forfeit leisure either.<br/>
 <br/>
Okay, <br/>
 <br/>
We always use ie never ie after the letter &quot;c&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
conceit  deceive  ceiling  receipt<br/>
 <br/>
**If we hear the name sound of the letter &#39;e&#39; within an English root<br/>
word, and we know we must choose either ei or ie, we choose ie.<br/>
 <br/>
[Here is the line of reasoning if you are familiar with the Spalding<br/>
Spelling Notebook Page 3. Do I use ei or ie? If the word we want to<br/>
spell is in the Nonsense Sentence Column, we use ei. If the word says<br/>
the name sound &#39;a&#39; as in &#39;veil&#39;, we use ei. <br/>
 <br/>
If there is letter &quot;c&quot; preceding the name sound &#39;e&#39; as in &#39;receive&#39;, we<br/>
also must use ei. If our word is none of the first three columns, by the<br/>
process of elimination, the word must use the ie phonogram saying the<br/>
name sound &#39;e&#39; in the root word.]  <br/>
 <br/>
belief brief field piece priest<br/>
 <br/>
:o) This program studies the 1700 most commonly used words in the<br/>
English language as well as 74 phonograms and 41 rarities. I dont have<br/>
to waste time with words that they will not encounter frequently. And it<br/>
sticks to the English language, so I&#39;m not forcing a foreign language on<br/>
them. Though we will be learning Spanish so we can communicate in a<br/>
second language.<br/>

Unfortunately I wrote those without really thinking, you are correct. My<br/>
excuse is that my posts have been long and my mind is turning mush like.<br/>
:o)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The phoneme &#39;u&#39; has three sounds.  uh &quot;hut&quot;  u music  oo as in put (and<br/>
there is a lift in this sound, not like skull.<br/>
Skull is using the first sound as in &quot;hut&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
The &quot;u&quot; make THREE sounds. <br/>
 <br/>
The dictionary is very helpful in deciphering our language. <br/>

make any real progress on because learning by immersion just doesn&#39;t <br/>
make as much sense as learning formally.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to get this intellectually because right <br/>
now it&#39;s all just a bunch of weird unschoolers with this wacky theory <br/>
from your point of view. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the thing that can&#39;t be argued with is that the kids *do* learn <br/>
to spell without being formally taught. It makes no sense from a <br/>
schoolish perspective but the data is there is there and needs <br/>
explained! ;-) So perhaps turn your thinking around from this can&#39;t <br/>
work to this does work so why does it work if it doesn&#39;t make sense?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (and thousands of other unschooled children) are learning <br/>
to spell without being taught. And they are doing it with no more <br/>
effort than learning to speak English. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also; &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*If* learning to spell without a system were difficult then it would <br/>
be easier. But learning without a program is painless and goes on <br/>
pretty much without a great deal of conscious effort.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help to realize that humans are naturally drawn to <br/>
discover patterns. We really can&#39;t help it. :-) And that&#39;s what <br/>
children naturally do with language without thinking about it. They <br/>
absorb huge amounts of data and they unconsciously search for <br/>
patterns. Just as they did learning to speak English. Think of all <br/>
the irregular verbs they mastered just by memorizing. And despite all <br/>
those irregular verbs they can conjugate brand new verbs using the <br/>
standard rule without being taught: I bake/he bakes/they bake, I <br/>
sluff/he sluffs/they sluff.<br/>
<br/>
It makes no sense. But there are thousands of kids that can&#39;t be <br/>
explained away by &quot;it makes no sense&quot; :-)<br/>

FEEDBACK<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Spelling is proven to NOT be natural and I really detest the &quot;whole<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;language&quot; approach to spelling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m curious as to where you&#39;ve seen this proven? (I&#39;m not attacking, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; really curious. :o)) My daughter has always been unschooled and learned to<br/>
&gt; read in what I guess would be called a whole language approach. She was<br/>
&gt; surrounded by language (written and spoken). We read to and with her,<br/>
&gt; answered her questions, played games, etc. No formal lessons of any kind.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s 8 and a pretty good reader by most standards, I guess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her spelling also improves every day. She&#39;s doing this by real life<br/>
writing.<br/>
&gt; Letters to friends, stories, poems, labels, charts, etc. Sometimes she<br/>
asks<br/>
&gt; me for spellings and I&#39;ll throw in a helpful phonics rule. Lots of times<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll just spell the word for her. Other times she knows instinctively or<br/>
&gt; something how to get to a correct spelling.I haven&#39;t seen any negative<br/>
&gt; spelling effects for her based on how she learned to read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son *does* have trouble with spelling and sounding out words. But he<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; the one who got more phonics in his life. I also wouldn&#39;t blame phonics<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; his difficulties, though. It think it has more to do with how his brain<br/>
&gt; works. He&#39;s a big-picture thinker and gobbles up entire paragraphs without<br/>
&gt; worrying about the details of one or two words. Works for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Most of us learned from ps, and maybe didn&#39;t remember all the rules, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;learned the basic i before e except after c, type thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember reading once that this rule is &quot;not&quot; true more often than it<br/>
&quot;is&quot;<br/>
&gt; true. Does anyone know...is this true? ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988253169">That was neat! LOL! <br/>
 <br/>
Well, really I didnt address it as &quot;I before E except after C&quot;<br/>
But the way I addressed it was the IE phoneme. :OD<br/>

Which fits into all that you have written! LOL! <br/>

JOYCE&quot;S FEEDBACK<br/>
 <br/>
Let&#39;s see, &quot;I before E except after C and in words that say I or A like<br/>
Einstein and weigh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most readily known exceptions being:  seize, either*, weird,<br/>
foreign,<br/>
leisure, conscience, counterfeit, forfeit, leisure, neither, sufficient,<br/>
species, efficient, sufficient, neither, weirdo, foreigner, seizure,<br/>
forfeiture, protein, caffeine, heifer, sheik<br/>
<br/>
And the I before E words:  relief, believe, niece, chief, sieve, frieze,<br/>
field, yield, priest, shield, pie,<br/>
<br/>
And the E before I words:  receive, deceive, ceiling, conceit, vein,<br/>
sleigh,<br/>
freight, eight, receipt, conceited, conceive<br/>
<br/>
A words:  neighbor, weigh, weight, sleigh, eight<br/>
<br/>
I words:  Eileen, height, sleight, stein, Einstein, science<br/>
<br/>
*either depends on how you pronounce it as to whether or not it is an<br/>
exception.<br/>
<br/>
So, the rule words would total slightly more than the exception words.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s learning to spell because she recognizes the spelling patterns <br/>
herself. It&#39;s when I see that she&#39;s having difficulty that I&#39;ll present her <br/>
with a tip (or rule) to help her see them. It&#39;s only helpful to her when she <br/>
needs it. And her flow of writing is uninterrupted by the formalities of <br/>
spelling. She is a prolific writer, with notebooks full of stories, poems, <br/>
facts and observations. And from what I can see, her spelling improves every <br/>
day. I&#39;m not about to mess with success. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that phonics rules are useless, or something to be avoided. <br/>
I&#39;m just saying that in my experience the rules are not something that need <br/>
to be &quot;taught&quot; in a systemized fashion. Or that they are something that need <br/>
to be in place before a child can begin to write freely. For me, Casey&#39;s <br/>
writing has been evidence that spelling progress *can* be achieved playfully <br/>
and over time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the explanation of the i before e rule. I must admit though, that <br/>
all of the rule stuff was pretty dry reading and I tended to just skim over <br/>
it. And the fact that even you, who seem VERY well versed on your phonics <br/>
BTW :o), gave a wrong example with the &quot;ull&quot; sound, leads me to believe <br/>
there are easier ways to achieve the goal than trying to always remember a <br/>
rule.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are so passionate and knowledgable about the phonics rules, you <br/>
may be able to pass on this knowledge to your kids in a natural, playful <br/>
way. The way Sandra does with word origins to her kids. Something to ponder <br/>
before you whip out the lesson plans. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
