Fundamental Principles of Natural Learning &quot;Self-Design and Global Ecology&quot;<br/>
<br/>
· learning and living are intrinsic to &quot;curriculum as experience&quot; ·<br/>
<br/>
· self-actualization is the right of each and every individual regardless of<br/>
age ·<br/>
<br/>
· whereas the origin of happiness is spiritual - the origin of unhappiness<br/>
is political arising from a politic of inequality and coercion ·<br/>
<br/>
· a politic of equality of respect for self discovery and positive self<br/>
expression is essential to the harmonious development of every individual ·<br/>
<br/>
· Wondertree is a context, is a safe and challenging community where the<br/>
youth determine their own course of study based on their natural enthusiasm<br/>
to know ·<br/>
<br/>
· where everyone manages the budget of the community ·<br/>
<br/>
· where the youth hire mentors relevant to their curiousity ·<br/>
<br/>
· the youth are encouraged to take responsibility and plan the program while<br/>
living in terms of the consequences ·<br/>
<br/>
· slowly they become responsible from the essence of their being to the<br/>
furthest edges of the world that they affect ·<br/>
<br/>
· real learning - natural learning is deciding what is worth doing ·<br/>
<br/>
· is deciding how to live in terms of one&#39;s own significance and in terms of<br/>
a shared sense of understanding and meaning within consensus ·<br/>
<br/>
· when one&#39;s purpose and the harmony of life on the planet come into balance<br/>
then the inner sense of fulfillment becomes the compass to guide one through<br/>
life&#39;s journey ·<br/>

to children of all ages - may learning be lived lifelong and heartfelt<br/>

Introduction to The Declaration of Learner&#39;s Rights and Responsibilities<br/>
<br/>
In May and June of 1994 six young people met with their mentor, Brent<br/>
Cameron, to discuss and write a learner&#39;s rights document. They had been<br/>
invited to give a presentation on their ideas on education by the organizers<br/>
of a conference to be held in Victoria on the Rights of Children.<br/>
Interestingly, we were the only group to address the issue of education and<br/>
children&#39;s rights. We chose the word &#39;learner&#39; because it can be associated<br/>
with lifelong learning and avoided already &#39;age&#39; loaded terms like child and<br/>
adult. We also avoided the word student as this role is closely associated<br/>
with schooling and teachers. We wrote 12 points that covered both rights and<br/>
responsibilities, asserting that you can&#39;t have one without the other. The<br/>
underlying assumption is based on the fact that virtually everyone in<br/>
cultures all around the world trust 2 year olds to learn how to talk without<br/>
being taught. Psychologists say that learning how to talk is probably one of<br/>
the most difficult learning tasks of a lifetime, yet each very small child<br/>
masters the complexity of language on their own initiative. A meaningful,<br/>
responsive and supportive relationship optimizes the languaging and<br/>
communication process. However, we do not trust children to learn to read or<br/>
do math on their own, we have developed a &quot;schooled&quot; attitude that if we<br/>
don&#39;t make children learn that they will not develop these skills.<br/>
<br/>
This assumption is what our Declaration challenges. We assert that learners,<br/>
regardless of age have the right to determine the direction and course of<br/>
their own learning. We assert that if a two year old can learn a language<br/>
without being taught then we need to re-think our entire production model of<br/>
public education. We propose that any new model for learning be based on the<br/>
underlying idea that human beings are biological and that a development and<br/>
growth metaphor would be the most appropriate model to support the lifelong<br/>
learning of every individual.<br/>
<br/>
The heart of the learning process is a mutually chosen and sustained learner<br/>
and mentor relationship where there is a shared enthusiasm and fascination<br/>
for learning in a particular field. The freedom to choose and design the<br/>
nature of this learning relationship is central to the Declaration of<br/>
Learner&#39;s Rights and Responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
The Declaration was announced in all of our four workshops and was given out<br/>
to the participants at the conference in June. That same week we also gave a<br/>
copy to the Minister of Education in Victoria. We intend to represent the<br/>
Declaration to the Minister each year on the anniversary until children have<br/>
a choice and a voice in the educational process. We intend to bring an<br/>
awareness to the issue of &quot;ageism.&quot;<br/>

Learner&#39;s Rights and Responsibilities - Wondertree Foundation for Learning<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. The Learning Process<br/>
<br/>
1.1. Every human is born with an inherent ability to learn. Learning is<br/>
integral to living. It is the awareness of change and development.<br/>
1.2. Learning is a lifelong natural process. Learning increases one&#39;s<br/>
ability and choices in responding to, and being responsible for one&#39;s<br/>
actions and thoughts.<br/>
1.3. Learning emerges from an integral enthusiasm to understand and has<br/>
inherent worth. Learning is a desire to know, and characteristically has its<br/>
own intrinsic reward.<br/>
1.4. Learning implies growth, and growth implies the realization of an inner<br/>
pattern of design and harmony. Balance in growth is achieved by maintaining<br/>
a harmony between one&#39;s conscious development and the underlying unconscious<br/>
awareness.<br/>
1.5. Learning is a mirroring process. If an individual is respected then one<br/>
will learn respect. It is a human need to create meaning and to be in a<br/>
responsive loving relationship.<br/>
1.6. It is essential to shift focus from teaching and expectations to<br/>
learning and curiousity. Meeting the needs of the individual is the best way<br/>
to invest in society, as fulfilled individuals will make positive<br/>
contributions to society.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. The Learning Individual<br/>
<br/>
2.1. Learning is based on experience. Patterns of experience form models for<br/>
understanding one&#39;s role in the world. One naturally learns through<br/>
modeling. Learning emerges from an inner desire and enthusiasm to understand<br/>
and to form meaningful relationships in the world.<br/>
2.2. Every individual has the right to determine the direction of one&#39;s own<br/>
learning, and correspondingly is responsible for one&#39;s learning.<br/>
2.3. Every learner has the right to be treated as a whole and competent<br/>
learner. The responsibilities for the results are each learner&#39;s opportunity<br/>
for growth.<br/>
2.4. Natural learning is the unfolding of the infinite potential within.<br/>
Self-realization is a process of understanding one&#39;s potential as one&#39;s role<br/>
in a dynamic between self and others.<br/>
2.5. Learning is ultimately a self-design process, therefore each individual<br/>
has the right to follow their own inner wisdom.<br/>
2.6. It is the right of every learner to be held in respect and it is the<br/>
responsibility of each learner to hold everyone else in respect.<br/>
2.7. It is the right of every individual to live and learn from a sense of<br/>
fulfillment, and to set goals that increase one&#39;s sense of self-confidence<br/>
and one&#39;s sense of oneself as a resourceful individual.<br/>
2.8. One&#39;s self is ultimately not exclusive of others, it is inclusive of<br/>
others through a sense of love and compassion. The purpose of living from<br/>
one&#39;s sense of fulfillment is that one&#39;s actions will naturally enhance the<br/>
experience of others and maintain a balance in relationships.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. The Learning Relationship<br/>
<br/>
a.) the family - parents<br/>
a3.1. The parenting relationship is the first and most significant<br/>
relationship. Each learning parent is responsible to respond to the learning<br/>
needs of the child as expressed by the child. Every child has the right to a<br/>
nurturing and responsive family.<br/>
a3.2. One&#39;s capacity or ability to learn is determined more by the quality<br/>
of one&#39;s relationships than any other factor. Given a meaningful and<br/>
responsive relationship, every child makes appropriate choices for their<br/>
level of ability.<br/>
a3.3. All families have the right to equal access to funding available for<br/>
learning within a society. It is the family&#39;s right to decide how to best<br/>
invest this funding for the lifelong development of learners.<br/>
a3.4. Life is a challenge, living is maintaining a delicate balance.<br/>
Children naturally model parents, and integrate their strategies. It is<br/>
therefore essential that parents are supported in taking responsibility for<br/>
becoming optimum models for learners.<br/>
<br/>
b.) the mentor<br/>
b3.1. A collaborative learning relationship is designed around a mutual<br/>
enthusiasm for learning. The roles of mentor and learner shift and it is the<br/>
responsibility of a mentor to share strategies and insights with the<br/>
learner. The learner-mentor relationship is based on the principles of<br/>
friendship and mutual respect.<br/>
b3.2. Every individual has the right to choose to participate in a<br/>
relationship that is essentially nurturing and caring. Conversely, in<br/>
achieving one&#39;s needs, one must be responsible to the realization of<br/>
another&#39;s needs.<br/>
b3.3. Each individual in a relationship has the right to choose to enter<br/>
into a relationship that is based on mutual gain. It is the right of an<br/>
individual to end a relationship.<br/>
b3.4. Learning is a self-evaluative process. Learning is a collaborative<br/>
process as it is important to include other points of view for an increase<br/>
in self understanding. It is the responsibility of each learner to invite<br/>
the point of view of others to gather information for further<br/>
self-evaluation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. The Learning Organization<br/>
<br/>
4.1. It is the responsibility of every learning organization to remain open<br/>
to redesign, to include everyone in a process of consensus evaluation for<br/>
ongoing openness and change.<br/>
4.2. Each individual has equal access to the resources of the community to<br/>
increase their learning through development. Each individual is responsible<br/>
to reciprocate the investment by the organization.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. The Learning Society<br/>
<br/>
5.1. It is the responsibility of a society to provide equal access to<br/>
resources and to invest in the spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and<br/>
physical growth of learners. It is the right of every individual to develop<br/>
to one&#39;s full potential and one&#39;s responsibility to share what one gains.<br/>
5.2. It is the responsibility of society to encourage diverse points of<br/>
view, and it is the responsibility of individuals in society to respect<br/>
other view points. A society has the responsibility to withdraw support for<br/>
view points that are against individuals or groups.<br/>
