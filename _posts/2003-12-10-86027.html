&gt;Part of the big lie in our culture is &quot;safe sex&quot;.<br/>
&gt;No such thing.<br/>
&gt;Check out the actual statistics.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Part of the big lie in our culture is that there&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; anything, that we <br/>
&gt;can keep our children or ourselves safe. What we can do is take steps to <br/>
&gt;increase our safety, but too many of those steps and we end up with a <br/>
&gt;severely restricted life. Reminds me of the discussion we had a while back <br/>
&gt;about letting kids go places by themselves, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Even waiting for marriage and being monagamous isn&#39;t safe, as shown by the <br/>
&gt;number of women with AIDS whose husbands were sleeping around.<br/>
