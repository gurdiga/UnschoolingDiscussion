September 13.  I think it starts with a five part program on Rome.<br/>
We tape it though,  so we can watch it whenever we want.  8 a.m. <br/>
central time is a little early for us, although once in awhile we <br/>
catch a Little House rerun then.  &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

&gt; somthing we would tape too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad somebody else jumped in with the URL.  I&#39;m having modem <br/>
problems today.  We had a really bad lightening storm and I&#39;m afraid <br/>
it may be damaged.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also programs on TLC called TLC Elementary School.  These <br/>
are great for younger kids that can&#39;t sit through a longer program <br/>
and don&#39;t want the in depth info.<br/>
<br/>
At the website,  you can sign up for a newsletter that brings you <br/>
info weekly.  I also get an educator&#39;s guide in the mail every spring <br/>
and fall - really nice!<br/>

I think this notebook idea is wonderful,  and not just until you get <br/>
the ideas flowing.  So often,  we think of something wonderful to do, <br/>
but if we can&#39;t do it right then,  we forget about it.  Then I feel <br/>
guilty later for dropping the ball.  I think I&#39;ll try this.  Thanks!<br/>

follow with another show, it is on reg discovery channel, and they suggest<br/>
things you should think about when watching it  things like that, usually<br/>
they run a whole week on one subject<br/>
