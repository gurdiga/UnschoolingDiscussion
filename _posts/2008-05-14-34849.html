<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877446066">I just watched Pollyanna yesterday. It is sort of about adult/child relationships. It has those wonderful Glad Game moments and lots about how you can change the way the world looks just by changing how you look at it.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378000216">I think it could initiate interesting discussions about how perspective can change a thing, as well as how adults often discount children. And there are some wonderful scenes with prisms. While watching it I was thinking about how much it is like Annie. An orphan inspires a wealthy person to change the world, starting from within. Annie is all about child/adult relationships. <br/>
<br/>
Along Hayley Mills lines, I&#39;ve always loved the Parent Trap. Again, it has some really strange things being glossed over, like the fact that neither girl knows the other girl exists. Differences in parenting strategies. Divorce and remarriage and the risks to children when those things happen. One of the most beautiful swimming pools I&#39;ve ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
The Addams Family, both the series and the movies. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading a lot of Charlie Brown these days, Linnaea likes to have comics by the toilet. We have a few of the Charlie Brown movies. I&#39;ve always found the adult &quot;wah wah wah wah wah&quot; fascinating. The fact that parents and teachers are not given voices or much presence in Charlie Brown. Even in the comic books adult presence is minimal. <br/>
<br/>
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which is the longest film, has Mr. Potts, the dad, sacrifice work hard to give his children the car that they want. And there is a good scene about why the kids aren&#39;t in school. <br/>
<br/>
Those are the ones I can think of at the moment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-803550500">It is very sad (holocaust, dad dies), but I think &quot;La Vita è bella&quot;<br/>
(Life is Beautiful) is an amazing movie about a father and son.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hope and Glory&quot; is a movie my siblings and I used to love. It is more<br/>
about the whole family, but there is parent child stuff too.<br/>

This is a list from a Christian site, but the movies they recommended<br/>
about parenting seem quite good:<br/>

helpful.  &quot;Frequency&quot; jumped out at me as one I should have thought of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923615744">Anime, not a movie, but still great.<br/>
<br/>
The manga &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; is GREAT and would be good for just about<br/>
every relationship example that I can think of (parent/child, friends,<br/>
family, romantic).   It is about a girl who stumbles in to a family<br/>
where there is a curse on the family and 13 of them are animals from<br/>
the chinese zodiac stories (12 in the zodiac plus the cat) and if they<br/>
are hugged by a person of the opposite sex they turn in to that<br/>
animal.  Sounds a little silly, but it is a great story.   It was<br/>
recommend to me by my younger brother so I think that it is one that<br/>
guys will like too.  Highly recommended.<br/>
<br/>
They did make it into an anime and it is well done, but it doesn&#39;t get<br/>
very far in the story.  Definitely worth watching, though, and Netflix<br/>
has it.  Watch the anime and then you (or your kid) can go get sucked<br/>
in to the story and read the manga.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hikaru No Go&quot; is a good anime for friendship.   (the manga is great<br/>
too and has some more side stories, but the anime covers just about<br/>
everything)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ranma 1/2&quot; does some parent/child stuff although it focuses more on<br/>
the friendship/relationship between the two main characters who<br/>
presumably marry in the end.  Mostly it&#39;s just fun and funny, though.</div>

I have an aversion to recommending this on my site because the author misrepresented <br/>
himself QUITE fraudulently.  Had he said &quot;I made this up,&quot; it would&#39;ve been hunky dorey, but <br/>
he lied and I dislike lying and liars *so much* that I wouldn&#39;t read it if it and I were on a <br/>
desert island.  I&#39;d use it for paper, but I wouldn&#39;t read it.<br/>

Harsh attitude, no doubt, but there are enough honest people (and people who write fiction <br/>
without saying it&#39;s their own personal autobiography) to keep  me busy for my remaining fifty <br/>
years, or six months, or whatever it will be.<br/>
<br/>
Being from Albuquerque and a UNM alumnus, I know more of the sordid details than people <br/>

============<br/>
The Education of Little Tree is a memoir-style fictional novel  <br/>
written under the pseudonym Forrest Carter by Asa Earl Carter. Since  <br/>
its first publication by Delacorte Press in 1976, the book has been  <br/>
the subject of acclaim. Many people have been drawn to its message of  <br/>
simple living, tradition, and love of nature. However, The Education  <br/>
of Little Tree has also been the subject of controversy after the  <br/>
publication of an article on October 4, 1991 by Dan T. Carter (a  <br/>
history professor and distant cousin of Asa Carter) called &quot;The  <br/>
Transformation of a Klansman&quot; in the New York Times. This article  <br/>
described Asa Carter&#39;s past involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.[1]<br/>
<br/>
The novel has spawned films, a sequel attempt and a number of  <br/>
graduate theses and scholarly articles. In 1985, the University of  <br/>
New Mexico Press bought the book&#39;s rights. It has since sold millions  <br/>
of copies, a rare level of success for a book distributed by an  <br/>
academic press, and won the 1991 American Booksellers Association  <br/>
Book of the Year (ABBY) award.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Literary, Personal and Political Controversies<br/>
<br/>
The book was part of a blossoming period for Native American memoirs  <br/>
and genre fiction, both before and after it was shown to be a  <br/>
fictional work posing as factual memoir. The controversies and  <br/>
discussions surrounding the story are generally centered on these  <br/>
main areas:<br/>
<br/>
* the clash of the factual details depicted in the book with those of  <br/>
the author&#39;s life<br/>
<br/>
* the clash between the cultural descriptions given in the book with  <br/>
traditional language and culture as reported by Cherokee reviewers<br/>
<br/>
* the possible legitimacy of fictionalized memoirs by a member of a  <br/>
privileged class depicting life within an underprivileged class<br/>
<br/>
* the book&#39;s possible racial sympathies and the possible intentions  <br/>
of the author<br/>
<br/>
These issues are magnified by the author&#39;s racism earlier in life,  <br/>
and the fact that little personal information is known about Carter  <br/>
or his exact state of mind, outside of reports from his wife, between  <br/>
his withdrawal from political life and the publication of The  <br/>
Education of Little Tree. Carter was an active participant in several  <br/>
white supremacist organizations, including the Ku Klux Klan and the  <br/>
White Citizens&#39; Council. He was also a speechwriter for Alabama  <br/>
Governor George Wallace, for whom he allegedly wrote Wallace&#39;s famous  <br/>
line, &quot;Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&quot;  <br/>
Although Carter claimed to be part Cherokee, in 1970 he ran for  <br/>
governor of Alabama on a white supremacist platform. That said, it is  <br/>
believed by some that Carter wrote The Education of Little Tree from  <br/>
his childhood memories of his Cherokee uncle.<br/>
<br/>
In the following years, Carter left Alabama, changed his name, and  <br/>
began his second career as an author, taking care to conceal his  <br/>
background. He even claimed categorically in a 1976 New York Times  <br/>
article that he, Forrest, was not Asa Carter.[2]<br/>
<br/>
The publisher&#39;s remarks in the original edition of the book  <br/>
inaccurately describe Carter as &quot;Storyteller in Council&quot; to the  <br/>
Cherokee Nation. When Carter&#39;s background was widely publicized in  <br/>
1991, the book was reclassified by the publisher as fiction. Today, a  <br/>
debate continues as to whether the book&#39;s lessons are altered by the  <br/>
identity of the author. As award-winning Native American author  <br/>
Sherman Alexie has said, &quot;Little Tree is a lovely little book, and I  <br/>
sometimes wonder if it is an act of romantic atonement by a guilt- <br/>
ridden white supremacist, but ultimately I think it is the racial  <br/>
hypocrisy of a white supremacist.&quot;[3]<br/>
<br/>
Members of the Cherokee Nation have said that so-called &quot;Cherokee&quot;  <br/>
words and many customs in The Education of Little Tree are  <br/>
inaccurate, and some have said that the novel&#39;s characters are  <br/>
stereotyped. Several scholars and critics have agreed with this  <br/>
assessment, adding that Carter&#39;s treatment of Native Americans  <br/>
possibly plays into the romantic but racist conceit of the &quot;Noble  <br/>
Savage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Carter died in 1979 he was working on The Wanderings of Little  <br/>
Tree, a sequel to The Education of Little Tree and on a screenplay  <br/>
version of the book. Twelve years after Carter&#39;s death, the fact that  <br/>
Forrest Carter was actually Asa Earl Carter was again exposed  <br/>
(following the original 1976 New York Times expose) by Dan T. Carter,  <br/>
who was a distant cousin and history professor. The supposed  <br/>
autobiographical truth of The Education of Little Tree was revealed  <br/>
to be a hoax.<br/>
<br/>
In 2007, Oprah Winfrey pulled the book from a list of recommended  <br/>
titles on her web site. While Winfrey had promoted the book on her TV  <br/>
show in 1994, calling the novel &quot;very spiritual,&quot; after learning the  <br/>
truth about Carter she said she &quot;had to take the book off my shelf.&quot;[4]<br/>
<br/>
Despite controversy surrounding the author&#39;s identity and legitimacy,  <br/>
The Education of Little Tree was critically acclaimed and won the  <br/>
1991 American Booksellers Association Book of the Year (ABBY) award.  <br/>
In 1997, The Education of Little Tree was adapted into a made-for-TV  <br/>
movie but was instead given a theatrical release. Despite Carter&#39;s  <br/>
background, The Education of Little Tree remains a classic and much- <br/>
loved story.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220505076">-=-I didn&#39;t know about this at all! Is there any truth or reality in  <br/>
it at all or is it total fiction? I&#39;m really disappointed because I  <br/>
really loved the movie. I have to say that I like the message of the  <br/>
movie though.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well there&#39;s an opportunity to look at &quot;truth and reality.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really loved the TV series Kung Fu, when I was in college and it  <br/>
was new.  I really liked the messages.  I liked the characters.  Was  <br/>
there any truth or reality in it?<br/>
<br/>
There were useful concepts, and ideas to make me feel all warm and  <br/>
thoughtful inside.  There were ideas that made me like other people  <br/>
in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would feel differently if it had been presented as a  <br/>
documentary of people who actually lived in particular times and places.<br/>
