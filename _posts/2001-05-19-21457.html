<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050147452">My kids have never been in school.  My oldest will be 11 years next <br/>
month ... so I&#39;ve been doing this roughly 7 years.<br/>
<br/>
The reason my husband and I chose to homeschool isn&#39;t because of one <br/>
issue:<br/>
<br/>
1.  My daughter had a very profound autistic-like response to <br/>
strangers when she was very young.  She was reading at three and was <br/>
exceptionally bright in other areas as well.  Her cognitive skills <br/>
were above average and she was tall for her age.  She is also very <br/>
pretty ... her father is Latin and she takes after him in skin tone, <br/>
hair coloring, and some other features.  The issue was that while she <br/>
wasn&#39;t shy with family and people she knew well, too many people in <br/>
the room or strangers elicited a very profound response from her.  <br/>
She appeared to completely shut down --- no facial expression, <br/>
unfocused eyes, completely still physically, would stop in midstride <br/>
or in the middle of whatever she was doing.  We decided that it would <br/>
have been too traumatic to put her in school until she outgrew this.  <br/>
And, she did outgrow it by the time she was six ... but in Florida, <br/>
kindergarten in mandatory and she would have had to go to school when <br/>
she was five years.  We have since found out that many children who <br/>
show &quot;giftedness&quot; at an early age also deal with sensory overload <br/>
issues ... this can come out in hyperness, tics, etc.  My daughter&#39;s <br/>
case was extreme but she did outgrow it with no problems.<br/>
<br/>
2.  At the time we could not afford private school and the public <br/>
school where she would have attended was (and is) one of the worst in <br/>
the district.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  While I am a product of public school, my husband is a product of <br/>
private school.  His opinion is that most kids that attend private <br/>
schools are the ones that couldn&#39;t make it in public school or got <br/>
expelled.  Now my opinion isn&#39;t that radical, but spouses must <br/>
compromise.  So, even though we could now afford to send the children <br/>
to private school, it is our opinion ... reviewed often ... that they <br/>
are best educated at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added reasons over the years ... anyone in Florida knows the sad <br/>
state of our school system.  And living in the Bay area we also deal <br/>
with issues of random and daily violence, rape (even in middle <br/>
schools), drugs, gangs, teen pregnancy, etc.  Not every school is <br/>
bad, not every publicly schooled kid is warped ... I&#39;m just not <br/>
willing to subject my kids to the possibility of them coming into one <br/>
of these situations until they have the emotional grounding to be <br/>
able to face it.<br/>
<br/>
There are also issues of governmental interference with parental <br/>
rights and what is being taught in today&#39;s classrooms ... with and <br/>
without parental consent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548806283">I sent my oldest dd to 3 nursery school classes, then I jumped into home<br/>
schooling with both feet. (She is a nursery school drop out and proud of it!<br/>
LOL) She would be in Kindergarten this year and I am so thankful that I<br/>
discovered homeschooling/unschooling before I sent her.  I had been reading<br/>
about home schooling but figured that I would try kindergarten first and if<br/>
it didn&#39;t work out, I would bring her home.  After the reality check of<br/>
nursery school where I thought I  would be preparing her to be able to leave<br/>
me a bit easier,(NOT) I realized that I could unschool her and if that<br/>
didn&#39;t work out, I could always send her to school.  I haven&#39;t looked back<br/>
and I can&#39;t imagine her ever wanting to go to school, but if she does, we<br/>
will deal with it then.  I too think school is toxic and she would have to<br/>
have some pretty good reasons to want to go and be at an age where I felt<br/>
she could make an informed decision about it.<br/>
<br/>
And like Kathy, my oldest daughter is extremely bright and shy and I know<br/>
with absolute certainty that she would be bored in school.  When you enter<br/>
kindergarten reading at a fourth grade level what do you do when the kids<br/>
are learning the letter A in January?  I am certain they wouldn&#39;t even<br/>
address the issue and Leigh is so shy in group settings that she certainly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t shine and be the teachers pet.<br/>

<br/>
None of mine went to school.  I had information from La Leche League friends <br/>
about the current state of homeschooling, and I read all I could find, being <br/>
an info junkie.  I had started off (before I had kids) opposed, because I was <br/>
a teacher, and I talked my cousin (my age) out of homeschooling when she <br/>
first mentioned she might.  Because of that (she eventually had five kids and <br/>
all went to school until the last coulple were given the option to leave as <br/>
young teens) I&#39;ve worked to help others have the nerve, the info, emp<br/>
owerment, awareness, local contacts and ready-defenses for relatives so that <br/>
other kids don&#39;t have to &quot;try school&quot; first or for as long.<br/>
<br/>
For my efforts sometimes I am flamed horribly by people who are clinging to <br/>
structure and arbitrary disciplines about &#39;doing school work&#39; or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
--I could stop for my own comfort and prevent attacks by people I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
--I could wimp out and give unschooling-lite information to appease those who <br/>
will come to the forum or this list for a couple or six months looking for a <br/>
little info before they move along.  <br/>
<br/>
--I could say &quot;Oh, that makes sense&quot; when peole say &quot;We&#39;ll unschool science <br/>
and history, but we can&#39;t risk reading or math, so we&#39;re using a curriculum.&quot; <br/>
 But I don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
People waste time and money trying NOT to unschool when they can unschool for <br/>
free.  The same way Nestle makes more money off formula than LLL makes off <br/>
giving out free breastfeeding information, people wanting to sell stuff to <br/>
homeschoolers are WAY more pushy than those offering free information on how <br/>
to do it for free.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our kiddos will never go to school, unless/until they choose to do so <br/>
in the future. As to how we came to &quot;the nerve, the info, the <br/>
empowerment, the awareness, the ????? &quot; to do so, I&#39;d just say that I <br/>
used to have a &quot;Question Authority&quot; sticker on my guitar case, and I <br/>
guess I just never stopped doing just that. When I became pregnant <br/>
with our first child, we started looking at the status quo (hospital <br/>
birth, immediate vaccinations, circumcision, bottle feeding, cry-it-<br/>
out, authoritarian parenting, daycare and then public school) and <br/>
just decided to take another road. One thing led to another on that <br/>
road, and here we are unschooling or just living life and learning <br/>
from it.<br/>
