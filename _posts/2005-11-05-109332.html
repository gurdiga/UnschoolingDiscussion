<div id="ygrps-yiv-632201916">my 12 yr old was upset today because his public school<br/>
friend was talking about his homework, and my son<br/>
wasn&#39;t familiar with some of the 7th grade curriculum<br/>
and concepts that his friend was talking about. always<br/>
having been the &quot;brain&quot; between the two, my son didn&#39;t<br/>
like being ignorant this time. (i&#39;ve already talked to<br/>
him about chilling out on competing in this way etc)<br/>
but he blurted out &quot;i&#39;m getting dumber!&quot; &quot;everyone<br/>
else is learning more than me, and you aren&#39;t teaching<br/>
me anything&quot; <br/>
we had a long talk and he calmed down. but of course,<br/>
his words stuck with me since this is only my 2.5 yr<br/>
of doing homeschooling, and my first year of really<br/>
embracing unschooling. i have worried many times that<br/>
i&#39;m &quot;dumbing them down&quot; because i&#39;m not using a<br/>
curriculum and not keeping up with the joneses/public<br/>
school thing. i know that the kids in public school<br/>
are doing more than we are, and it&#39;s hard to swallow<br/>
sometimes. it feels like we&#39;re slacking off lots of<br/>
times. i don&#39;t know. i just could use anyone&#39;s<br/>
expertise in this area right now. thanks! DC<br/>

Hmmm...it sound like you don&#39;t trust unschooling 100%. These kind of<br/>
issues are explored often at unschoolingbasics.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time with anyone thinking that allowing a child to<br/>
explore their interests in freedom is &quot;dumbing them down&quot;!! <br/>
Memorizing a set of facts is preferable to creative thinking...HOW?<br/>
<br/>
Good that your child doesn&#39;t know the same things! GOOD!!<br/>
<br/>
He shouldn&#39;t. No one on earth should have the exact same body of<br/>
knowledge...we are UNIQUE individuals, with different purposes for our<br/>
life journey. Why on earth should we know the same thing?<br/>
<br/>
The only place in life that anyone is supposed to have the same body<br/>
of knowledge is that false environment we call school. Where else in<br/>
life is anyone expected to know ALL the exact same things?  Some of<br/>
our areas of knowledge overlap other people&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know ANYONE<br/>
on this earth with the exact same knowledge I have.<br/>
<br/>
Rejoice that your child doesn&#39;t know a bunch of trivial BS that is<br/>
meant to shut down creativity, trap people in dead end jobs and rob JOY. <br/>
<br/>
Do me a favor, and go to starchildstudio.com. Go to the &quot;links&quot; page<br/>
and visit some of the sites on creative thinking. THOSE are the<br/>
important traits in life...the ability to adapt your knowledge, the<br/>
ability to learn, the ability to THINK. <br/>
<br/>
Someone posted the &quot;traits of success&quot; recently. Could someone point<br/>
her to that list? It has NOTHING to do with the body of &quot;knowledge&quot;<br/>
being taught in school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have perhaps forgotten, yourself, that those kids will forget 99  <br/>
percent of what they are taught in school?<br/>
<br/>
They are almost certainly &quot;covering&quot; a lot of material that your son  <br/>
isn&#39;t being exposed to - so accept that as a fact. Unschoolers are  <br/>
NOT going for that kind of education - the mile-wide and an inch-deep  <br/>
kind. I just have to laugh when I picture all these historians and  <br/>
special interest types sitting in meeting after meeting, deciding  <br/>
what is going to get included in the state standards. They argue  <br/>
about how many sentences will be devoted to Columbus versus Sequoia  <br/>
versus so-and-so..... AS IF IT MATTERS! The level of pretense, the  <br/>
amazing amount of denial that they live in - it never fails to  <br/>
astound me.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what the friend is supposed to be studying. Some specific  <br/>
subject - like if you were in California and he was in 4th grade he&#39;d  <br/>
be studying the Missions.  Find some information about it and quiz  <br/>
him on anything beyond the most basic facts. &quot;How many missions were  <br/>
there? WHY that number?&quot; He probably won&#39;t be able to answer the  <br/>
basic facts, if he&#39;s already had the test on them he&#39;ll have  <br/>
forgotten them, but he almost CERTAINLY won&#39;t have a clue about the  <br/>
&quot;why&quot; questions.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t worry about it too much since it doesn&#39;t happen often that  <br/>
school kids WANT to talk about stuff they&#39;re being taught in school  <br/>
since they usually aren&#39;t much interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo hangs around with a lot of school kids - soccer, girl  <br/>
scouts. They talk about school a lot - but NEVER what they&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to be learning. They talk about how mean the teachers are  <br/>
and how hot or not hot the boys are. That&#39;s about it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well, the difference between you and I is that I don&#39;t worry at all!!  <br/>
My son knows lots of things that public school kids don&#39;t know and <br/>
they are things that are going to serve him much better in his unique <br/>
life.  On the other hand, my son did come to me about 8 months ago <br/>
begging me to buy him a curriculum????????????????????????????????  I <br/>
was a little taken back because we have never really used a <br/>
curriculum, even in our more &quot;schooly&quot; days.  <br/>
<br/>
I pretty much ignored his requests, thinking that he was getting <br/>
pressure from his public school friends, but he kept bringing it up <br/>
over and over again.  Finally sometime in August he got quite <br/>
persistent with me so we sat down and discussed why he would want a <br/>
curriculum.  Turns out he has a lot of interests and he thought a <br/>
curriculum would give him great ideas and maybe expose him to <br/>
something that I would not think of.  So..............I broke down and <br/>
bought him a curriculum.  So far he has worked on two math lessons and <br/>
two social studies lessons.  The social studies was on Elizabethan <br/>
England and it actually sparked quite an interest.  Him and I would <br/>
sit on the couch for hours reading books that we got from the <br/>
library.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think that some of his deeper reasons had to do with his public <br/>
school friends because I have heard their conversations and they seem <br/>
extremely worried that he is ruining his life by not doing &quot;school&quot;.  <br/>
He always has some great unschooling comebacks that they stutter at <br/>
answering back.  The wonderful thing is that he is free to explore the <br/>
curriculum if he wants and free to ignore it if he wants; if something <br/>
sparks his interest and leads to other things then great, whatever.  I <br/>
think he is figuring out though that about 80% of it is just silly.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing for me is that he really hasn&#39;t had much formal math, <br/>
except for the basic adding when he was around 1st grade and he didn&#39;t <br/>
have any trouble at all picking up 7th grade math, not like I worried <br/>
anyway because I know he will get what he needs because that is what <br/>
kids do that are left to explore on their own!!<br/>

kids in school are learning more than he is. Totally different. This  <br/>
advice makes it sound like kids will be &quot;ready&quot; at some point to  <br/>
learn what kids in school are learning. Perhaps that is what you  <br/>
think unschoolers are doing - waiting for our kids to be &quot;ready&quot; to  <br/>
learn what kids are learning in school? Not so.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   The (apparent) reason he needs and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The REASON for needing and wanting something doesn&#39;t matter? It has  <br/>
NOTHING to do with unschooling?  What a strange thing to say.  <br/>
Unschooling involves learning because the learning is meaningful, it  <br/>
matters, it is useful, it is pleasurable, it is perceived as  <br/>
personally valuable. It isn&#39;t learning what kids in school learn so  <br/>
as not to be &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you don&#39;t know him and that this is very strange advice on an  <br/>
unschooling list. Unless I missed some posts, there was no indication  <br/>
that this kid has any interest in research, developing research  <br/>
skills, libraries, research librarians, or anything else, in particular.<br/>

that he isn&#39;t learning as much as kids in school and he&#39;s worrying  <br/>
about it.<br/>

I&#39;ll get back to those questions.   You don&#39;t need to answer them for us, but <br/>
consider them for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
-=- i know that the kids in public school<br/>
are doing more than we are, and it&#39;s hard to swallow<br/>
sometimes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even put it in your mouth.   Don&#39;t even look at it. <br/>
&quot;Doing more&quot; means something to you that I doubt it means objectively to <br/>
others reading this.   I hope it does, anyway.   &quot;Doing more&quot; of something...    <br/>
You&#39;re looking at school and schoolkids.   You&#39;re still living in the shadow of <br/>
school.   School is too big in your life.<br/>
<br/>
-=- it feels like we&#39;re slacking off lots of<br/>
times.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing if you got out of your house more, went places (not the library, <br/>
or not the library more than maybe 5% of the time), saw/smelled/heard/touched <br/>
and tasted new things you would not feel like a slacker.<br/>
<br/>
Back to that earlier business, and another question.   If this is the first <br/>
year you have &quot;really embraced unschooling,&quot; do you mean this year beginning in <br/>
August or September?   Or January 2005?    Deschooling is more important for <br/>
you than for your son, and his deschooling will need to include those two <br/>
years or however much of school at home, too.   Yours, though, will need to <br/>
inclucde those two years plus all the years you were defending school when he was <br/>
younger, plus all the years you attended school yourself.   At one month per <br/>
year of school... You probably won&#39;t be able to really understand or relax into <br/>
unschooling for a while, but starting is the place to start!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Get up and move and do and be.   Don&#39;t worry.   And certainly don&#39;t worry <br/>
many times.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Do you think school would help?<br/>
<br/>
Would school be better than what you&#39;re doing now?<br/>
If not, then DO what you want to do.   BE what you want to be.   Don&#39;t just <br/>
think about it and worry about it lots and even harbor the slightest thought of <br/>
&quot;keeping up with the joneses&quot; which you have defined as what it seems kids at <br/>
school are doing.<br/>
<br/>
If you think what kids at school do is the measure of what is right and good, <br/>
you could put your son in school.<br/>
<br/>
If you have chosen not to have him in school, remind yourself of why.<br/>

Thanks Sandra, we haven&#39;t watched that so I will check it out.  Yes, <br/>
we have been doing the Shakespeare thing, he finds it all so <br/>
fascinating so that has been a very cool thing.  I did spend more <br/>
than I would have liked but it does have some pretty cool stuff in <br/>
it that has even sparked my interest so I just keep all the lessons <br/>
(ideas) in a folder so if anyone wants ideas for things to do it can <br/>
serve more of a reference than anything.  <br/>
<br/>
We also found out about a outdoor Shakespeare theatre in Oregon that <br/>
is supposedly set up like one of the originals that we plan on <br/>
visiting on our trip around the country.  They have it set up so <br/>
that you can take in up to three shows a day.<br/>
