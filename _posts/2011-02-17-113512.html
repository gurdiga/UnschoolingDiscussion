<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166350906">Look at www.wonderwheelsbmx.com<br/>
...or on their Facebook page.<br/>
They are in Indianapolis, and send their stunt teams all around to schools and businesses. My nephew is on the team. Maybe there is a show somewhere that you might be able to see. You could ask them questions either place. I&#39;m guessing you have already looked at YouTube videos and Googled for info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553461719">My boys lives revolve around BMX!  They ride every day  and have a really<br/>
cool BMX<br/>
community of friends that they ride with.  Sometimes they go to<br/>
skateparks, sometimes dirt jumps, sometimes our house.  This last fall the<br/>
boys built<br/>
a full size half-pipe in our yard (there is an unschooling story in there<br/>
too one day).<br/>
<br/>
My boys subscribe to the magazine RideBMX.com .  They watch youtube videos<br/>
and cable tv shows like Firsthand (fuel tv channel).  Mostly they learn from<br/>
doing<br/>
and from riding with guys that show them how to do certain stunts.<br/>
<br/>
The bike shop will be a great place to find out more info., find out where<br/>
the boys<br/>
can ride.  Not all skateparks allow bikes.  Some are bike only.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413657574">Thanks Ladies,<br/>
<br/>
My boys are pretty talented builders. We live pretty far out in the country so no available skateparks, but more than ample room to build ramps and half pipes etc.<br/>
Thanks <br/>
