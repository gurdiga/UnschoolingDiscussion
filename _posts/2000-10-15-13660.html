Transgenic Corn Disallowed as More Tainted Taco Shells Turn Up<br/>
<br/>
&gt; RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, North Carolina, October 13, 2000<br/>
&gt; (ENS) - A type of genetically engineered corn not approved for<br/>
&gt; human consumption was voluntarily pulled from the entire agricultural<br/>
&gt; market this week after a watchdog group detected the product in<br/>
&gt; yet another brand of taco shells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aventis CropScience agreed to cancel its license to sell the biotech<br/>
&gt; corn, which is known as StarLink, after the coalition Genetically<br/>
&gt; Engineered Food Alert announced that it had discovered the cornmeal<br/>
&gt; in Safeway brand taco shells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last month, the watchdog coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert<br/>
&gt; said it found StarLink corn in Taco Bell brand taco shells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aventis consented to the remedy at the &quot;strong urging&quot; of the U.S.<br/>
&gt; Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has approved StarLink<br/>
&gt; for use only as an animal feed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The deal struck between Aventis and the EPA this week means that<br/>
&gt; StarLink corn can no longer be planted for any agricultural purpose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Today&#39;s agreement will ensure that in the future no new StarLink<br/>
&gt; corn will be grown and none will find its way into the processed foods<br/>
&gt; like taco shells,&quot; the EPA declared in a written statement. &quot;The<br/>
&gt; voluntary agreement represents far and away the fastest tool<br/>
&gt; available to EPA for quickly removing StarLink corn from being planted<br/>
&gt; for any agricultural purposes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This action will ensure the full protection of public health and<br/>
&gt; continues customer confidence in the food supply,&quot; the EPA said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; StarLink corn has not been approved for direct human consumption<br/>
&gt; because of unresolved questions regarding its effect on human<br/>
&gt; health. The corn, which is engineered to be toxic to insects, has also<br/>
&gt; been found to be heat stable and resistant to stomach acids and<br/>
&gt; enzymes, indicating that it could cause allergies in humans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Allergens can cause skin rashes, nausea, and respiratory problems. In<br/>
&gt; severe cases, allergens can cause anaphylactic shock or death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the EPA was quick to emphasize that there is no evidence that the<br/>
&gt; consumption of StarLink will lead to any of those problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;EPA does not have any evidence that food containing StarLink corn<br/>
&gt; will cause any allergic reactions in people, and the agency believes<br/>
&gt; that the risks, if any, are extremely low,&quot; the agency declared in its<br/>
&gt; statement. &quot;However, because Aventis was responsible for ensuring<br/>
&gt; that StarLink corn only be used in animal feed, and that responsibility<br/>
&gt; was clearly not met, today&#39;s action was necessary.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),<br/>
&gt; the suspension of StarLink sales could cost Aventis some $100<br/>
&gt; million. The USDA last month agreed to buy up all of this year&#39;s<br/>
&gt; StarLink crop and sell it for animal feed and other related uses after<br/>
&gt; the substance was detected in Taco Bell brand taco shells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Taco Bell products, manufactured by Kraft Foods, were<br/>
&gt; voluntarily recalled from grocery store shelves on September 22. The<br/>
&gt; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially recalled the<br/>
&gt; products ten days later under the provisions of a class II recall,<br/>
&gt; which is defined as a &quot;situation which the use of, exposure to, a<br/>
&gt; violative product may cause temporary of medically reversible<br/>
&gt; adverse health effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Neither the voluntary or mandatory recall affected products sold at<br/>
&gt; Taco Bell restaurants, although federal officials said they would test<br/>
&gt; those foodstuffs as a precautionary measure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Safeway began pulling its brand name taco shells off store shelves<br/>
&gt; Wednesday night. Customers who purchased the shells are being<br/>
&gt; asked to return them to the store for a refund.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both Safeway and Kraft Foods used the same corn flour supplier for their<br/>
taco<br/>
&gt; shells, the Azteca Milling Company of Plainview, Texas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Azteca is investigating the incidents and has reportedly implemented<br/>
&gt; testing procedures to ensure that the genetically modified corn does<br/>
&gt; not reach its mills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is not good enough for Genetically Modified Food Alert, the<br/>
&gt; watchdog coalition that prompted the recalls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Larry Bohlen, director of health and environment programs at coalition<br/>
&gt; member organization Friends of the Earth, said that the incidents<br/>
&gt; illustrate bigger problems with the government&#39;s regulatory<br/>
&gt; procedures.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Two contamination incidents in one month show that the FDA is<br/>
&gt; doing a miserable job protecting the American food supply,&quot; Bohlen<br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The coalition has called on the FDA to test all corn based food<br/>
&gt; products for the presence of Cry9C, the gene engineered into<br/>
&gt; StarLink corn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Genetically Engineered Food Alert has also called on the FDA to<br/>
&gt; conduct a thorough investigation into numerous reports of illness<br/>
&gt; made to FDA and alleged to have been caused by consumption of<br/>
&gt; contaminated taco shells.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The recall of Taco Bell taco shells distributed by Kraft and the<br/>
&gt; recent finding of StarLink corn in Safeway products underscores the<br/>
&gt; need for stronger government regulation over genetically engineered<br/>
&gt; foods,&quot; said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental<br/>
&gt; Trust. &quot;While these genetically engineered ingredients continue to<br/>
&gt; enter the market, the FDA refuses to mandate pre-market safety<br/>
&gt; testing of genetically engineered ingredients or labeling for<br/>
&gt; consumers&#39; right to know.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aventis is a global corporate group with European roots in Germany<br/>
&gt; and France. Aventis CropScience was formed in December 1999 from<br/>
&gt; the combination of AgrEvo, the Hoechst/Schering joint venture, and<br/>
&gt; the Rh√¥ne-Poulenc agriculture division. Their website can be found<br/>
