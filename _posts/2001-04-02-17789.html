<div id="ygrps-yiv-295811516">I&#39;d like to thank those of you who responded to my email awhile back about my <br/>
plans to send my 3 yo triplet boys to preschool before unschooling.  Boy, was <br/>
that said in ignorance!  Since then I have visited three preschools and was <br/>
horrified at two of them.  They truly are little schools!<br/>
]<br/>
    The one I like was a very well known Montessori preschool in our area.  <br/>
I&#39;m attracted because of the patterns of working without being interupted, <br/>
putting things away, and following one&#39;s own interest.  I didn&#39;t observe any <br/>
art going on, so don&#39;t know whether art experiences would be as directed as <br/>
the ones I saw at the other preschools.  (I remember once reading a book <br/>
about parenting by a woman who the jacket said had written a book called <br/>
something like &quot;the Uncoloring Book&quot;.  Anybody know anything about that <br/>
book?)   <br/>
<br/>
    My boys are very normal boys.  They hardly ever let each other sit and be <br/>
involved in anything.  There has recently been quite a bit of improvement in <br/>
that area and I wonder if this too will be outgrown.  That&#39;s hard for any of <br/>
you to say, as three of your kids aren&#39;t the same age and stage!<br/>
    We recently joined a big health club with a big nursery and I&#39;ve noticed <br/>
that George, who loves to build with blocks, is usually at the block table <br/>
with other kids, not his brothers, and that he is allowed to build <br/>
uninterrupted.  Also, when I am in the room and someone sets up a howl at <br/>
being messed with and I ask them if they want to do it (puzzle, play with <br/>
dinosaurs, or whatever) alone, and they say yes, and I explain to the <br/>
intruder that his brother wants to do it alone, then it is okay and they are <br/>
left alone.<br/>
    <br/>
    So, at the moment I am wavering between thinking a year or two of <br/>
expensive Montessori might set us up for personally directed learning, and <br/>
thinking that the sports classes and nursery at the health club is all we <br/>
need for preschool.  Help!  REgistration is sooner rather than later if I <br/>
want three spots at the Children&#39;s House!<br/>
    <br/>
    Barda, you referred to an eye opening Montessori story.  I would <br/>
appreciate hearing it if you have time to write it down!  And welcome.<br/>
<br/>
    When I joined this list a month or two ago I thought I was really driven <br/>
to be doing it so soon.  My boys won&#39;t even be three until June!  But I&#39;ve <br/>
always wanted to unschool and I love to learn things and think the next <br/>
fifteen years learning with and from them is the way I&#39;d be happiest.  DH at <br/>
this point doesn&#39;t have a concept but I&#39;m making him a file of posts to help <br/>
him out!!!<br/>
    I&#39;m so pleased I joined this list that I just sent in my membership check <br/>
of $25 to the local homeschool support group.  Even if I just read their <br/>
newsletter, it will be local info and good to share with DH.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks in advance for anyone who responds to this cry for info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105135807">Hi georgeanne. This was in my &quot;Drafts&quot; folder waiting to be finished, but I<br/>
saw your recent post and realized that you were still searching for answers.<br/>
So here&#39;s my 2 cents, for what that&#39;s worth :-)<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:GeorganneD@...">GeorganneD@...</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about that book specifically, but we have many &quot;uncoloring<br/>
books&quot; around our house (otherwise known as blank paper and crayons :-)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you to say, as three of your kids aren&#39;t the same age and stage!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;d like, I&#39;ll pass this email on to someone I know with older<br/>
homeschooled triplets (I think they&#39;re about 10 y.o. now). She might even<br/>
be on this list, though I haven&#39;t seen her post. As for siblings not letting<br/>
each other sit and be involved in anything, that happens here too (and I<br/>
daresay in any house with more than one child :-).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     So, at the moment I am wavering between thinking a year or two of<br/>

&gt; need for preschool.  Help!  REgistration is sooner rather than later if I<br/>
&gt; want three spots at the Children&#39;s House!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess my 2 cents would be to sit down and think of the positives and<br/>
negatives of each situation and see if you can see a clear case where one<br/>
would outweigh the other. I have occasionally thought about sending my son<br/>
to preschool, primarily so I&#39;d have some one-on-one time with my daughter,<br/>
and he&#39;d have some time where he didn&#39;t have to contend with a toddler into<br/>
everything he&#39;s doing. So I basically did a cost-benefit analysis of the<br/>
situation and decided that for us it makes more sense to have him at home. I<br/>
don&#39;t just mean monetary costs, I included things like &quot;He will have to eat<br/>
on a schedule&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll have to get him out of the house at a certain time<br/>
every morning&quot; and &quot;He&#39;ll learn all kinds of things I don&#39;t want him to<br/>
know&quot; in the &quot;cost&quot; section as well as the $$$ it would cost us and<br/>
non-monetary benefits under the benefits side as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Barda, you referred to an eye opening Montessori story.  I would<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what this story is, but I do know someone who had real problems<br/>
with a Montessori-type preschool (in Washington) with their 3 year old<br/>
daughter. I guess they (Montessori) are real big on finishing what you&#39;ve<br/>
started, and finishing one &quot;level&quot; of tasks before you can move on to<br/>
something else. My friend&#39;s daughter was not allowed to move on to one<br/>
exercise (something to do with cuisinaire rods, I think) because she hadn&#39;t<br/>
finished the previous one yet.  I guess I get the concept, but it sort of<br/>
runs against what I believe in about how kids learn, which is that each<br/>
child learns in their own individual way. I think if you&#39;re planning on<br/>
unschooling, this may be something you want to consider - will having to<br/>
learn things a certain way interfere with the way they think about learning<br/>
and their own abilities? Only you know the answer for your own kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When I joined this list a month or two ago I thought I was really driven<br/>
&gt; to be doing it so soon.  My boys won&#39;t even be three until June!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I believe that &quot;unschooling&quot;, unlike schooling has no stopping or<br/>
starting place. It could just as easily be called &quot;lifelong natural<br/>
learning&quot;. It seems bizarre to me that people will now be considering my son<br/>
to be &quot;school aged&quot;, when really nothing magical occurs. He will learn<br/>
tomorrow the same way he learns today. It *is* great to think about doing it<br/>
before putting kids into a school situation. I know many unschoolers have to<br/>
&quot;deschool&quot; and undo the damage a formal learning system can do to a child&#39;s<br/>
natural desire to learn. This is one reason I&#39;ve leaned away from doing any<br/>
kind of formal preschool, but each person has to make their own decision. If<br/>
I ever did preschool for my kid, I think I&#39;d lean more towards Waldorf than<br/>
Montessori. Waldorf schools, especially for very young children, emulate a<br/>
home-like atmosphere. They are very gentle and natural and believe kids<br/>
learn through play and through emulation (of adults who are cooking,<br/>
cleaning, doing &quot;fingerwork&quot; or knitting, sewing, etc. ) at the preschool<br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
One other reason I have stayed away from the idea of preschool is that I<br/>
want to keep my child&#39;s imagination from being prematurely limited. The<br/>
other day he wanted to paint his fingernails pink, which he said looked<br/>
&quot;magical&quot; and made him look &quot;like a fairy&quot;. I can imagine that other<br/>
preschool-aged kids would quickly quash this sort of instinct as most 4 year<br/>
olds in constant contact with the TV and other sources are pretty well aware<br/>
already that little boys shouldn&#39;t want to look fairy-like. In fact, we were<br/>
at a bike store the other day when he was admonished by another 4 y.o. there<br/>
because he was riding &quot;a girl&#39;s bike&quot; (it had a pink seat, but was otherwise<br/>
blue). My son wouldn&#39;t have known that pink is mysteriously reserved for<br/>
girls until this. I know he will encounter this eventually, but I&#39;d like to<br/>
preserve the magic of a non-limited imagination for a couple more years if<br/>
possible. Advertisers and manufacturers of children&#39;s products have done<br/>
such an impressive and thorough job of pounding certain attributes into our<br/>
youth (even looking at the toy advertisements in the local newspaper, it is<br/>
painfully obvious that only little boys play with trucks, and the &quot;pink<br/>
pages&quot; are for little girls), that I feel it actually closes down some of<br/>
their ability to think in different ways before they&#39;re ready to understand<br/>
such sex stereotyping. In any case, that&#39;s just another thing that I<br/>
considered thoroughly before making my decision.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, I hope you find a solution that works for you!<br/>
