<div id="ygrps-yiv-706055122">My son aged 3 years 2 months has been watching movies on video <br/>
endlessly. Today he watched about 5 movies, from approximately 11 <br/>
in the morning to 7 in the evening, stopping only for a short period <br/>
to get in the van to go drop off his sisters somewhere. I have <br/>
allowed him to watch all he wants, but to be honest I hate the fact <br/>
that he watches so much. So I am wondering, is this normal? Should <br/>
I be setting limits? Is this a phase he is going through? Should I <br/>
just let him watch all he wants until he eventually gets it out of <br/>
his system? Will he ever get it out of his system?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

<br/>
The simple answers are:<br/>
yes, normal<br/>
no, limits make it worse<br/>
maybe a phase<br/>
let him watch it<br/>
don&#39;t assume that &quot;get it out of his system&quot; is desireable.<br/>
<br/>
If you had a three year old reading books, I don&#39;t think you would write &quot;but <br/>
to be honest I hate the fact that he reads so much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taking in information.  He&#39;s found a way to get input without leaving <br/>
the house.<br/>

<br/>
Could you not have made that a longer outing and taken him somewhere with <br/>
just you where he could do something new and interesting?  Feed ducks?  Play on a <br/>
playground?<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, is feeding ducks inherently better than watching a movie?  And <br/>
if feeding ducks for twenty minutes can be fun, would feeding ducks for two <br/>
hours make any sense?  Yet watching a movie or reading a book for two hours is <br/>
about the only way to really get any benefit from it at all.<br/>

I just can&#39;t imagine a 3 yo sitting still on the sofa through 5  movies.  My <br/>
last 3 yo was always doing something else AND watching  movies.  He always had <br/>
a toy in his hand or something spread out on the  floor.  He listened to the <br/>
moview with one ear while he made noises with  his airplanes, or he glanced at <br/>
the screen while he drew a picture, until his  favorite part came on.  <br/>
 <br/>
So is your son just sitting there doing nothing else but watching a movie,  <br/>
or is there something else he&#39;s doing, too?<br/>

<br/>
my kids did exactly this when we first moved here in the middle of august<br/>
and we got cable for the very first time (previously, we&#39;d gotten 2-3<br/>
channels in on our antenna at our old house and there were rarely shows<br/>
of interest to them.)  they were now exposed to cartoons 24/7 (heaven of<br/>
heavens to them!) and sometimes would even stay in front of the tv not<br/>
only all day, but most of the night as well, only to wake again in the<br/>
morning and ask first thing, *can i watch tv?*  it really irritated me. <br/>
i worried for their health and my sanity.<br/>
<br/>
i tried play doh, new art supplies, going for a walk, playing outside,<br/>
offering to take them to the park, everything i could think of, and it<br/>
didn&#39;t let up any.  i started just leaving it be and trying to trust that<br/>
they were digesting it as they needed to and all was well.  i brought<br/>
their food to them instead of griping about them not coming to the table<br/>
(though i still miss our table time) and i sat with them while they<br/>
watched some shows that i thought at first glance were asinine...turns<br/>
out they&#39;re really funny!  beyond that, it was clear that they were<br/>
getting plenty out of what they were watching...it was sparking them in<br/>
ways that surprised, amazed and even sometimes embarrassed me.<br/>
<br/>
now that some time has passed, i see them doing stuff while they watch<br/>
like karen was talking about...playing with blocks, dough, trains, dolls,<br/>
drawing, stuff like that.  and they&#39;re spending less time watching...some<br/>
days not at all and other days it seems like they rarely leave it.  the<br/>
only thing that bothers me about it now is that on those days when they<br/>
are sitting for the majority of their awake time, they&#39;re usually jumping<br/>
around and bouncing off the walls at night.  we talk about how there&#39;s<br/>
all this extra energy in them and how can we get it out so we can wind<br/>
down and stuff...that helps.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve had to let go of what seems to have value to me and let my children<br/>
find value in their own lives and their own experiences...that&#39;s so huge.<br/>
 i always thought i was doing them a favor by first not having a tv and<br/>
then later, restricting their watching time.  it seemed unhealthy.   my<br/>
perspective has shifted so that i can honor my babies in each of their<br/>
worlds and be amazed at how happy they can be about things i would never<br/>
have dreamed for them.  i learned to truly trust them to be whole and i<br/>
became more of partner in crime with them rather than a dictator over<br/>
them.  i learned that sometimes they do know better than me and that they<br/>
are perfectly competent beings.<br/>
<br/>
so anyhow...know that this is definitely normal.  it may or may not go<br/>
away.  and that&#39;s ok.  there is plenty of value in tv/movies.  it&#39;s as<br/>
much of a dream world for kids as books (if not more).  i know it can be<br/>
frustrating when its all new to you...i can&#39;t tell you how many times i<br/>
wondered if i wasn&#39;t doing something horrible my letting my children<br/>
watch as much tv as they wanted.  i was sure it would backfire and that<br/>
it would make my kids passive.  they&#39;re still lovely and beautiful and<br/>
full of life....driven from the inside instead of following my lead so<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
relax and enjoy the wonder of your child. :)<br/>
<br/>
all is well...<br/>
love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585190526">I see you have also posted about this topic on AlwaysUnschooled, and <br/>
you seem to be getting a lot of good advice.  I especially like what <br/>
Sandra Dodd posted below.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to post on this topic until a conversation I had with <br/>
my chiropractor&#39;s secretary inspired me to share...<br/>
<br/>
(Preface: my 17month old head-butted me in the nose yesterday <br/>
afternoon and after hearing a crunch and looking in the mirror to <br/>
find my nose having shifted a good few centimeters to the right, we <br/>
rushed off to the chiropractor&#39;s convinced my nose was broken!!  <br/>
Fortunately it was not and this saved me a trip to the hospital.  Woo-<br/>
hoo!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, after having my nose inspected, the secretary commented on my <br/>
3 year old saying that he was such a beautiful child and was just <br/>
shining with a glow on his face.  She asked me, &quot;He doesn&#39;t watch any <br/>
television does he?&quot;  This made be laugh inside because what I really <br/>
wanted to say was something like, well, you have no idea how much tv <br/>
he watches!  Quite an addict my partner would say!  I came close to <br/>
saying, actually I let him watch as much tv as he wants!  And, boy, <br/>
is it alot!  When in fact what I did say was that no, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
watch television because we don&#39;t get cable, and thus no channels, <br/>
but he does like to watch quite a few vidoes!  More than my partner <br/>
prefers, but I am much more flexible about it.  <br/>
<br/>
It was an interesting conversation, and she was suprised that <br/>
Sebastian watched any tv at all, because she said it seemed like <br/>
children who watch a lot of tv don&#39;t have a glow like my child does.<br/>
Perhaps his glow comes from the fact that we let him watch whatever <br/>
he wants whenever he wants, and respect his desires and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Sebastian started watching tv (back when we had cable- gotta love The <br/>
Croc Hunter and Nick Jr.!) towards the end of my pregnancy with his <br/>
brother (they&#39;re 22 1/2 months apart).  Then, we let the cable go <br/>
(due to finances) and soon he was a video junkie.  His video watching <br/>
escalated to a good 5 videos a day easily, and at times I did <br/>
feel &#39;concerned&#39;, but this was something I had to process myself.  He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t play, or do something else while watching a video.  He <br/>
literally did just sit on the couch and watch.  He was concentrating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not concerned anymore, and he still loves to watch.  He&#39;s <br/>
learning from them.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck finding a place you feel comfortable about your child&#39;s <br/>
video watching!<br/>

Perhaps his glow comes from being respected and trusted as the beautiful  <br/>

*schooled*, not tv watchers.<br/>

<br/>
One of the officers who ran a junior police academy in which Marty <br/>
participated said afterward that Marty was wonderful, and he said &quot;You can always tell a <br/>
kid who comes from a family with discipline, with rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Sebastian glows and TV has nothing to do with it.<br/>
Maybe lots of kids who don&#39;t glow also watch a lot of TV.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if people in medical offices were a little more scientific <br/>
about what they state as fact, even receptionists.   I could extrapolate from <br/>
that story and a few others that people who work in the medical field consider <br/>
correlation to be the same as cause and effect, that they&#39;re not very <br/>
scientific.    More likely, those who work with people who think their pronouncements <br/>
carry truth just because they&#39;re professionals have some of that rub off on <br/>
them.   Maybe that&#39;s why secretaries at schools seem to think they know all <br/>
about homeschooling laws, because the administrators they work for think they know <br/>
all about education.<br/>
