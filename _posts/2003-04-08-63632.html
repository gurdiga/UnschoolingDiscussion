&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;So do you have anything constructive I can do besides read?  Something <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;that you personally have done or know about that was so way cool about <br/>
&gt;&gt;math that children can&#39;t resist?  That&#39;s really what I&#39;m looking for.&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Games.  Any kinds of games involving deductive reasoning (Clue, Scotland <br/>
Yard, Master Mind) or strategy (chess, chinese checkers) or numbers and <br/>
patterns (Five Crowns).  Traditional card games like rummy or poker or <br/>
hearts, which involve all of the above.<br/>
<br/>
And with games, you get conversation and relaxation and humor.  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell her what she&#39;s learning or using.  It&#39;s much better if <br/>
you don&#39;t label the math skills being used.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference between a child figuring out math, odds, statistics, and <br/>
patterns on their own as opposed to someone droning on about them is the <br/>
difference between a live butterfly in and out of flowers in your yard, going <br/>
on to who knows where, doing exactly what he was born to do, and a dead <br/>
butterfly pinned on a piece of cardboard.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t kill math to capture it.   You end up capturing boredom and frustration <br/>
and aversion.<br/>
