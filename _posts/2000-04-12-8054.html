I will ask my chiropractor for more info for you. I imagine the trauma comes<br/>
from the baby&#39;s head banging on things like the cervix to start labor and<br/>
pushing down through the birth canal with the rest of the body&#39;s weight<br/>
following. Not to mention all of the time the baby is head down before it is<br/>
born. Can you imagine what standing on your head for 4 months must do to<br/>
your back? LOL. As for what people did before chiro...nothing. I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s harmful not to go I just think it can&#39;t hurt to go. As for the frequent<br/>
adjutments, I do that by choice. I know things are different if you&#39;re<br/>
injured, but I go because it makes my back feel good, takes tension from my<br/>
neck, etc. My chiro. has a poster up that compares chiro treatments to<br/>
orthodontic care. If you go to the ortho for frequent tightnings, etc and<br/>
take good care of your teeth between visits, the better the end result will<br/>
be. I hope that  answeres some of your ?&#39;s, I&#39;ll try to get more.<br/>

&gt; amy,<br/>
&gt; maybe you and some others with an understanding of chiro can help me see<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; the justification for birth being so traumatic is?  how can something so<br/>
&gt; natural by design cause such havoc on the system?  what did people do<br/>
before<br/>
&gt; chiropractic?  i have heard this before but it has never made sense to me<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; i am willing to listen...  also, why the continual adjustments?  what do<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days where we&#39;d need to keep<br/>
&gt; going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess the thought of being so<br/>
&gt; dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>
