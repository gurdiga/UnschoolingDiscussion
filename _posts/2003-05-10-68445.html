<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I live in a city *called* Columbus.  I don&#39;t know if they still have <br/>
this, but there used to be life-sized models of his boats downtown.  <br/>
Or one boat, I can&#39;t remember.  Didn&#39;t go see it.  I don&#39;t celebrate <br/>
Columbus Day, but I do have to remember that it exists because my <br/>
mom&#39;s birthday is October 11, and the post office is closed the <br/>
Monday of the week of her birthday, so I have to mail her card and/or <br/>
gift early so it will get there in time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went looking for an excerpt we have, of something Columbus wrote, <br/>
it is in our Harvard Classics, but I can&#39;t find that volume right <br/>
now. Anyway, I did read it once upon a time, and I remember Columbus <br/>
being upset with his men for taking in broken pieces of colored glass <br/>
to trade with the natives. He ordered his men not to trade useless, <br/>
broken trash for the natives&#39; valuable goods. Ordered? or requested? <br/>
I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, he also took a whole bunch of Native people back to Spain <br/>
as slaves...and he also died a broken man, because in reality, he <br/>
wasn&#39;t a leader, but had been granted the governance of the West <br/>
Indies which position he was not equal to. He returned to Spain his <br/>
final time, in complete disgrace...like, in shackles or something.<br/>
