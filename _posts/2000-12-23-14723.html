<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762123040">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post frequently, but I do enjoy reading your posts. I am hoping to <br/>
get some of your feedback.  My son was seven in October, and wants to learn <br/>
how to read but is very frustrated by the whole process. We have Oak Meadow, <br/>
Sing, Spell, Read, Write and How to teach your child to read in 100 lessons. <br/>
I completely buy the whole unschooling philosophy, and I have educational <br/>
materials available to my boys but don&#39;t push them into it. We used Oak <br/>
Meadow last year for probably a month, and SSRW for about the same amount of <br/>
time.  At the beginning of the year, my seven year old and five year old both <br/>
said that they wanted to learn how to read. We started using the 100 lessons <br/>
book, and they both seemed to enjoy it. My five year old asked to do the <br/>
lesson every day. We got to chapter 30, and both lost interest so we stopped. <br/>
I noticed a big difference in their learning styles. My five year old seemed <br/>
to grasp phonics better than my seven year old. My seven year old would add <br/>
sounds, flip-flop sounds or just guess the word. He would actually sound out <br/>
a word, practically saying it. Then I would ask him what the word was, and he <br/>
had no clue. He would sound out cat perfect, and then say the word was frog. <br/>
Their learning differences led me to look into different learning styles, <br/>
which led me to several books on right-brained vs. left-brained kids. My <br/>
seven year old definitely seems to fit the descriptions for a right-brained <br/>
child. Several of the books indicated that right-brained children seem to <br/>
learn reading better with the whole-language or sight-word method. I feel <br/>
stuck because my seven year old really wants to learn how to read, but he <br/>
gets so completely frustrated. When this happens, we just stop. On one hand I <br/>
feel this is best, but on the other hand, I don&#39;t want him to get <br/>
discouraged. I think it&#39;s also difficult for him because his five year old <br/>
brother seems so comfortable and at ease trying to read. Recently, my seven <br/>
year old said to me, &quot;I would know how to read if you taught me&quot;. I was <br/>
floored. First of all, I felt like a failure, and then I felt really sad for <br/>
him. I&#39;m not sure what to do next. I would just love some feedback from some <br/>
of you with older kids. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

his own word book that has pictures and the word<br/>

You could also have him dictate stories to you and you<br/>

You could also label all the things in the house like<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370101090">My approach with my kids was to read to them a lot, support them when <br/>
they wanted to try out reading, and encourage them to be patient with <br/>
themselves. My experience is that there is a long period of storing up <br/>
knowledge of the words before the actual reading &quot;kicks in.&quot; Once that <br/>
happens they progress pretty quickly. While they were in these pre and early <br/>
reading stages we worked with the &quot;I Can Read&quot; series of books many of which <br/>
are by Dr. Seuss and his alter ego, Theo LeSieg, as well as Sid Hoff and <br/>
others. These are fun books.<br/>
     My son&#39;s reading took off around age 8. My younger daughter, Ariana, <br/>
took somewhat longer and was much more frustrated as she&#39;s more into books. <br/>
We would work with her but she would just reach her limit with trying to get <br/>
it. I would have to keep reassuring her that eventually her reading would <br/>
kick in. And it eventually did. During the summer of &#39;99 when she was 9 1/2 <br/>
she was in an &quot;American Girls&quot; craft class and I had to read the little books <br/>
to her. By winter of 2000 at 10 1/4 she was taking another such class and was <br/>
able to read the books to herself. Then this past summer she took off. The <br/>
library had a Harry Potter theme for the reading program and had a great <br/>
bookcase of &quot;magic books&quot; to choose from. Some were old favorites and some <br/>
we&#39;d never seen. She read and read and read all summer and hasn&#39;t slowed down <br/>
since. This fall (at age 11) in addition to her recreational reading she&#39;s <br/>
started reading historical novels. She just finished &quot;Johnny Tremain.&quot; She <br/>
waited so long to read that she&#39;s still ecstatic about being able to.<br/>
    Both Michael and Ariana were whole word learners. Phonics worked for <br/>
Michael to fill in his learning after he already knew how to read. It still <br/>
doesn&#39;t make any sense to Ariana.  <br/>
    Part of why I have found it easy to be relaxed about their learning <br/>
process with reading is that I taught myself to read when I was 4yo, <br/>
listening to records from the <br/>
library (downtown Enoch Pratt in Baltimore) and reading along. My oldest also <br/>
learned to read at 4 by playing phonics games with my husband. Looking back <br/>
on it, he wishes that he&#39;d left her a bit more to her own devices, partly <br/>
because by age 10 or 11 she needed glasses and the other two don&#39;t. <br/>
Nonetheless, reading came easier and earlier to her than to the others. All <br/>
my kids are good readers at this point, I trust yours will be too in good <br/>
time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201896348">My daughters are learning to read in completely opposite ways.  I labeled <br/>
everything in the house for my 4yo dd, and I try to read to them as often as <br/>
possible.  I turn the closed-captioning on the TV.  But 4yo dd just wasn&#39;t <br/>
picking up anything.  Not that I was concerned or anything, I was just <br/>
noticing that she didn&#39;t seem at all interested.  I&#39;ve always thought that <br/>
the phonics way of learning was really stupid, how could anyone possibly <br/>
remember all of those rules?  Also, I understand how your son can sound out <br/>
a word and still not know what the word is.  I STILL do that.  So I&#39;ve <br/>
always related to the whole word method of learning to read.  It seems to <br/>
make so much more sense to me.  But my 4yo dd, has shown signs of picking up <br/>
reading in a phonicsy way.  She&#39;s started writing, and asking me how to <br/>
spell things, now she is learning what sound every letter makes and putting <br/>
the sounds together to form words.  She is doing all of this on her own, I <br/>
haven&#39;t even brooched the subject of phonics.  But I think this is how she <br/>
will learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo- my 2yo dd has started picking up whole words.  I was completely <br/>
surprised by this because I wasn&#39;t even focusing on her, I was trying to <br/>
help the 4yo along.  But suddenly 2yo has started recognizing words like <br/>
table, chair, and such from the labels all over the house.  2yo dd can <br/>
recognizes the words and 4yo doesn&#39;t.  I have everything labeled, and then I <br/>
write words on post-it notes, for instance, I have a &quot;coffee table&quot; label, <br/>
then I write &quot;table&quot; on the note and say &quot;okay Jordan (4yo dd) this says <br/>
coffee table so do you know what this says&quot; and she looks at both of them <br/>
and just can&#39;t figure it out.  She says &quot;chair&quot;, but then along comes 2yo dd <br/>
and she says &quot;oh that&#39;s table&quot; and takes the post-it note to the table and <br/>
matches it up with the label on the table.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are videos with sing-along songs on them, that might help your <br/>
son pick up the words.  Because as the song sings, the words are shown on <br/>
the screen with a little bouncy ball that bounces on the word as it is sung.<br/>

Keep getting information into him by other means (videos, harder books he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to read at his age anyway), and happily, and avoid <br/>
situations which spotlight reading.<br/>
<br/>
Brag up (subtly, not blatantly which will make it worse) stuff he can do.  <br/>
Get him to assemble things, or fix things, or help you with math or whatever <br/>
it is he&#39;s good at.  That helped lots with Marty.  Marty&#39;s 11 and didn&#39;t read <br/>
fluently until this year.  Now he can look at anything and read it, but <br/>
earlier this year he was missing big words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943268783">well, my ds is only 5 but it almost seems like he was<br/>
closer to knowing how to read when he was younger than<br/>
he is now. He wants to read so bad. He recently went<br/>
through this thing where he would ask me to teach him<br/>
to read &quot;really quick&quot;, and asked my older sister and<br/>
mom the same (who we live with), as if he just thought<br/>
I COULD do it but just didn&#39;t want to or soemthing.<br/>
But then he asked me one time when we were starting to<br/>
watch Between the Lions (love it) and I got him some<br/>
paper cuz he always writes the letters and stuff that<br/>
he learns on that show and was explaining some sort of<br/>
phonics sound to him or something and he said he<br/>
wanted to learn to READ. and I said well, if we learn<br/>
the letters and how they sound then we it helps us<br/>
learn how to read words. he said, frustrated with my<br/>
ignorance, &quot;MOM, I want to read BOOKS, not WORDS!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821650396">Oh, and also, I was just discussing with my boyfriend<br/>
(the kids &quot;2nd daddy&quot;)how ds knows all the words<br/>
associated with the computer like &quot;OK&quot; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;YES&quot;<br/>
&quot;New&quot;<br/>
&quot;Game&quot;....he doesn&#39;t &quot;read&quot; them knowingly, per se,<br/>
but recognizes them, only becuz he has loved playing<br/>
on the computer so much and wanted to be able to do it<br/>
more on his own. When I told him hey look, man, you&#39;re<br/>
reading! It built up his confidence to do it more. <br/>
And also both my kids love &quot;living books&quot; computer<br/>
games, where they are read the story (which is also<br/>
interactive, as in they can click on different things<br/>
in the picture and makes it like a game), and it<br/>
highlights the words as they are read. We have<br/>
Tortoise and the Hare right now and Green Eggs and<br/>
Ham, which has some other little rhyming games and a<br/>
matching game on some of the pages, too. Or the sing a<br/>
long videos, too, might be helpful, to recognize the<br/>
words and sounds set to music. Just a few thoughts.<br/>
Hope the best for you, and your son, too.<br/>
