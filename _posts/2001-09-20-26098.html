&gt; Don&#39;t cave into this, and not hold the babies, sounds like the <br/>
&gt; little ones <br/>
&gt; are having some jealousy issues.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was this in reply to what I said about my girls and babies?  It seems<br/>
like it judging by placement and header.  If so, you misunderstood.  Mine<br/>
aren&#39;t little (16 and 14) and they aren&#39;t jealous.  They just aren&#39;t<br/>
giving me any grandchildren anytime soon.  It has become a running joke<br/>
now.  They know I am just counting the years until they start having<br/>
babies because I don&#39;t have any little ones of my own and I miss it. <br/>
That&#39;s why they just deadpan a &#39;no&#39; every time I pick one up!<br/>
Surprisingly, Rachel seems to really like babies.  It was sort of a<br/>
surprise to me because I was expecting her to be the one not to like them<br/>
and Jenni to drool over them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295389011">I know you only speak for you but what you said really made me look at<br/>
the whole exchange from a different viewpoint.  I still think a lot of<br/>
the misunderstanding stems from the fact that we (general &#39;we&#39;) took such<br/>
drasticly different routes to the same place.  I think I do just speak a<br/>
different language because of where I started.  So in that way, some of<br/>
the misunderstanding is my responsibility and I am trying to make myself<br/>
clearer.  Unfortunately, I think several people have stopped listening.<br/>

&gt; of my own thought process.   Although it made sense to you, it may <br/>
&gt; not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623105540">I am so tired of being on edge.  It seems the tension in our home has<br/>
mounted continually since the 11th.  Dh is in the emergency services and<br/>
gets memos from the FBI saying look out for this, look out for that, our<br/>
intelligence suggests this......<br/>
<br/>
The kids have descended into bickering in front of a television they aren&#39;t<br/>
even watching.  I am squawking at everybody.  The little kids are basically<br/>
out of control and I am having trouble getting a handle back on things<br/>
<br/>
On top of this, my little guy has to go into the hospital for tests and my<br/>
oldest injured her wrist badly and is basically one-handed for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I feel better for venting.  Maybe we will make some cookies, a cup of kava<br/>
kava for me, some milk for the kiddies.  Maybe read a book or cuddle and<br/>
watch a movie.  I already feel better and calmer.  Funny how just typing out<br/>
things does that.<br/>
