wasn&#39;t because I liked seeing people get hurt. I was enamoured with the<br/>
special effects. At one point in my teenage years I could name off all the<br/>
important FX studios and artists (and I collected comic books and I was a<br/>
girl. Definate geek.). I understood that it was a movie and nobody was<br/>
getting hurt. So if I hissed, &#39;cooooool&#39;, after a head was parted from its<br/>
shoulders it was in admiration of someone&#39;s skill with model heads. Anyhow,<br/>
I can&#39;t watch it like I used too. All the movies I used to watch didn&#39;t do<br/>
diddly to desensitize me in the long run and the last horror flick I watched<br/>
had me covering my eyes.<br/>

part is the darkest, the Mines of Moria. It&#39;s a pretty violent film but<br/>
she&#39;s watched the making of documentries on the DVD so she knows what goes<br/>
into making a Balrog or a good decapitation scene. How has it affected her?<br/>
Legolas is married to her apparently and we&#39;ve had marathon discussions<br/>
about good and evil. Has it harmed her innocence? I&#39;m not the right one to<br/>
answer that I think...I don&#39;t really believe in that and think &#39;innocence&#39;<br/>
is usually code for not talking to children about things that make adults<br/>
squeamish. It always assume childhood is some blessed state of happiness<br/>
free from worry and stress. Anyhow, off on a tangent. She&#39;s still the sweet,<br/>
caring girl we&#39;ve always had. I haven&#39;t noticed her running about the<br/>
neighbourhood slashing at the neighbours with a kitchen knife. :)<br/>
 I don&#39;t see my role as keeping my kids away from certain things, I see it<br/>
as making sure they&#39;re equipped to deal with and make choices about those<br/>
things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932781989">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about televisilon and my children, who are ages 3 and 4.  <br/>
I have relaxed a lot when it comes to television/videos and my kids watching <br/>
them.  However, ever since I have started relaxing my husband has gone from <br/>
having them watch PBS to GI Joe cartoons (this is when I am at work in the <br/>
evening).  It started out with PBS kid&#39;s shows, which I was very fine with.  <br/>
Then it went to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which I didn&#39;t really think was <br/>
age appropriate, but I let it go because my son loves it so much.  Then they <br/>
started watching Fox Box which I have never seen, but I didn&#39;t say anything <br/>
about that either.  But then he showed them GI Joe cartoons which for me <br/>
just seemed like too much for their age.  I just don&#39;t see the point of <br/>
letting them watch that.<br/>
<br/>
My husband believes that he is making sound judgement and that GI Joe is not <br/>
that bad (my son has the toys which I am okay with).  He doesn&#39;t let them <br/>
watch adult violent shows, but to me GI Joe is pretty violent.<br/>
<br/>
Do you guys think I am being overly controlling?  Would you suggest that I <br/>
sit down with my son and daugher while they watch the GI Joe cartoons?  From <br/>
reading previous posts, it seemed to me that many of you don&#39;t censor what <br/>
your children watch (but I got the impression you were talking about your <br/>
older children, too).<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A resounding &quot;yes&quot; to both questions.<br/>
<br/>
You might also then sit down the dh and talk about your &quot;tv values&quot;.  Your<br/>
kids are likely to sit and watch whatever your dh is watching just to spend<br/>
time cuddled up with him.  There are things that I only watch after the<br/>
younger kids are in bed.   But if the kids found the shows on their own and<br/>
wanted to watch them, I wouldn&#39;t forbid it....would just want to watch it<br/>
with them, be available for questions, etc..<br/>

My eight year old and I were watching Jesus Christ Superstar the other day. <br/>
We had listened to the CD a few days before, and I got the movie because he <br/>
asked me to. He knew that there were 39 lashes----he&#39;d counted with Pilate on the <br/>
CD. But when the flogging was coming up, he asked to leave the room. Instead, <br/>
I just fast-forwarded through the flogging. HE KNEW he wasn&#39;t ready to watch <br/>
that! <br/>
<br/>
We later discussed how they wouldn&#39;t actually whip an actor---that it was <br/>
just a special effect (in fact, during the overture, thre&#39;s a guy flogging the <br/>
plexiglass prop and making it bleed). <br/>
<br/>
I *could* have made him sit and watch. I *could* have made him cover his <br/>
eyes. I *could * have never even brought the movie home. I *could* have done a lot <br/>
of things. But because he knew what he could handle, we did it *his* way. <br/>
<br/>
Most children don&#39;t want to see people or animals hurt. Nor do they care to <br/>
watch sex scenes. They naturally shy away from both those things. Young <br/>
children who actively seek out those things may have other problems. <br/>

They can watch whatever they want.  Occassionally, they choose somewhat<br/>
violent movies or off-color humor (My kids are 13, 10, 7, 5 and 4).  The<br/>
vast majority of the time my kids choose to watch Nickolodean or Fox Family.<br/>
Currently the tv isn&#39;t even on.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, my kids have chosen to watch something that has bothered them (a<br/>
scary movie or something).  It made a big impression and now they are much<br/>
more selective.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is choosing to sit and watch hour after hour of grossly violent,<br/>
sadistic stuff.  The problem isn&#39;t that the stuff is on tv.  The problem is<br/>
that out of everything there is to do in the world, the kid is choosing that<br/>
stuff over and over.  Why?<br/>

<br/>
Sandra - I am not getting what you meant by this statement.  And I really <br/>
<br/>
want to!  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes (often?) a child (especially older children who have a pent up <br/>
store of parental judgment and limitation) will do something for no other reason <br/>
than that the parents have advised against it.  Either out of spite or <br/>
curiosity, he will see what could be so totally wrong about rock&#39;n&#39;roll or smoking or <br/>
staying out after midnight or eating ice cream for breakfast.  Sometimes, if <br/>
it&#39;s spite, he will KEEP doing the thing, hoping subconsciously to do damage to <br/>
his parents by doing it.   Some people get a tattoo not so much because they <br/>
can&#39;t imagine life without one, but because they KNOW it will burn their mom&#39;s <br/>
ass.  For life.<br/>
<br/>
So the first step in not getting to that point (even a little bit) with your <br/>
own children is to respect their decisions when they&#39;re small.  When the <br/>
children are small and when the decisions are small.   Marty wore a tiger costume <br/>
(just the stripey body-suit, not the hood or make-up) for most of a year.  With <br/>
cowboy boots.  Now years later Marty likes his head shaved.  I wish he&#39;d have <br/>
hair.   But I let him make his own decisions about tiger suits and shaved <br/>
head, and when he&#39;s grown and out, he will not feel the urge to wear something <br/>
because it was forbidden (nothing was forbidden) or to express himself with hair <br/>
or lack thereof *FINALLY.*  There won&#39;t be any relief of &quot;finally I can make <br/>
my own decisions,&quot; which has resulted throughout history in TONS of profoundly <br/>
bad &quot;decisions&quot; made not consciously, but in plain reaction to what was <br/>
previously forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is not that my husband forces my kids to watch the shows, but he <br/>
presents <br/>
<br/>
the shows to them.  I guess I am speculating that if he didn&#39;t present those <br/>
<br/>
shows that they wouldn&#39;t have the option.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your use of &quot;has them,&quot; &quot;presents&quot; and &quot;option&quot; don&#39;t match my uses of them.  <br/>
What options DO your children have with TV?  Do they have to wait for an <br/>
adult to turn it on and &quot;present&quot; something?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, I want to express all of my worries about these types of shows and <br/>
<br/>
perhaps you (the group) could provide some feedback...I guess GI Joe to me <br/>
<br/>
is a show with army guys who fight a lot. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t guess.  Either watch it or not.  No fair guessing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am worried that if my kids <br/>
<br/>
watch that show that they will grow up to be desensitized to that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most new moms worry about that.  Then they figure out it wasn&#39;t something to <br/>
worry about.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I worry <br/>
<br/>
that when they are adults and see violence on the news that it won&#39;t affect <br/>
<br/>
them - they wouldn&#39;t see the reality of it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT reality.  It&#39;s a story shown with drawings.  There have been <br/>
drawings since cavemen.  Do you think the cavement who drew hunts should have shown <br/>
more blood so younger hunters or children who saw that wouldn&#39;t become <br/>
desensetized to the reality of those chalk drawings?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My husband says that in GI Joe <br/>
<br/>
nobody ever dies.  That just seems really strange too - what is that <br/>
<br/>
teaching my kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re set to be equally unhappy if people don&#39;t die as if they do?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, I want to express all of my worries ...I guess . . . I am worried . . <br/>
. I worry <br/>
<br/>
 That just seems really strange  . . . I am worried ....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was your long paragraph with the unimportant parts taken out.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re worrying too much.  Really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;it just can&#39;t be good for them to sit and watch people shooting <br/>
<br/>
each other for hours.&gt;&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
G.I. Joe lasts less than half an hour. People on Ninja Turtles rarely get <br/>
shot unless it&#39;s with some fantasy raygun that does something weird to them.   <br/>
On second thought, there are hardly any &quot;people&quot; on Ninja Turtles in the <br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Honestly, I have always had a distaste for violence in movies and TV.  I <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t understand how people can watch other people being hurt.  That isn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
entertainment to me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AHA.<br/>
Try not to impose your own prejudices on your children.  If you can interest <br/>
them in what you think is fun, great!  That&#39;s honest.  But to try to forbid <br/>
what you don&#39;t like is not as honest.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe watching TV isn&#39;t &quot;entertainment&quot; for them in the way you&#39;re thinking <br/>
of it.  If you went to school when you were little, TV was probably escape from <br/>
that.   They don&#39;t go to school.  TV is part of life, part of learning, part <br/>
of new vocabulary and situations they can observe to wonder what they would <br/>
have done.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I watched two violent movies, The Art of War and The Recruit.  <br/>
My husband had rented them.  He watched them alone and then recommended that he <br/>
thought I would like them both, for unexpected plot twists.  He was right.  I <br/>
liked them.  I didn&#39;t like the violence, but I liked the plots.  And the <br/>
acting was good in The Recruit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If your young children wanted to watch an adult-rated movie that was really <br/>
<br/>
violent, would you let them watch it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but in my experience young children didn&#39;t want to watch them.  Or they <br/>
would watch a bit and then take off, or watch some and then snuggle with me <br/>
and ignore the movie. I didn&#39;t &quot;have them watch&quot; movies or &quot;expose&quot; them to <br/>
movies.  Because values weren&#39;t put on movies they never watched what they didn&#39;t <br/>
want to watch.  They watched what they wanted to do in such large part that <br/>
the idea of watching something they did NOT want to do was foreign.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t it the role of a parent to make <br/>
<br/>
sure that children are not exposed to this at too young of an age?  What <br/>
<br/>
about protecting their innocence while they are young?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had TONS of happy, musical, sweet videos.  Get more videos or DVDs to <br/>
watch with your kids if you want to preserve sweet innocence.   We &#39;bout wore out <br/>
Raffi in Concert, and Barney&#39;s Birthday and Sesame Street specials of various <br/>
sorts.  But Holly loved the movie Stand By Me when she was really little.  <br/>
Three.  <br/>
<br/>
Younger kids don&#39;t get the extended innocence that firstborns can have.  It&#39;s <br/>
just the way it works.<br/>
<br/>
I was watching The Art of War and Holly came in and I paused it.  She&#39;s 12.  <br/>
She likes Fight Club; it&#39;s not that she has never seen violent movies.   She <br/>
asked if it was a movie I thought she&#39;d like and I said probably not.  She said <br/>
she was going to go in the den and watch another movie.    <br/>
<br/>
After half an hour she came back, kinda bored, because she&#39;d seen her movie <br/>
and she likes to be with other people.  I paused it again.  She asked about it <br/>
again.  She said Maybe she should come and watch with me or maybe I should go <br/>
and watch with her.  I said it had Wesley Snipes, the guy who was in To Wong <br/>
Foo.  She laughed and said that&#39;s what she had paused downstairs--To Wong Foo.  <br/>
Pretty funny.   That one has some violence too.  Not as much.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at this TV collection?   There will be more added, so if you <br/>
look today look back in six months or a year and there might be more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300304962">&lt;&lt;Do you guys think I am being overly controlling?  Would you suggest that I<br/>
<br/>
sit down with my son and daugher while they watch the GI Joe cartoons?  From<br/>
<br/>
reading previous posts, it seemed to me that many of you don&#39;t censor what <br/>
your children watch (but I got the impression you were talking about your <br/>
older children, too).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4) self-censors, as is the only person in the house likely to say, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t want the TV on&quot; for any reason. If something is scary she says so, and<br/>
leaves (dvd&#39;s we jump ahead) or covers her head until the scene is over. The<br/>
only show we switch off if she happens to come in while we are watching it<br/>
is &quot;Real Sex&quot; (HBO) mostly because I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to answer any<br/>
questions she might have. Some of that stuff is pretty..um.. unusual. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s favorites shows are mostly cartoons like &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; (all<br/>
permutations), &quot;Max & Ruby&quot;, &quot;Dora&quot;, &quot;Brum&quot;, &quot;Hi-5&quot; (TLC and Discovery),<br/>
&quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Book of Pooh&quot; (puppets), &quot;Mary Kate and Ashley In Action&quot;<br/>
and &quot;Toad Patrol&quot;. For live action she is starting to like &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;<br/>
(Disney), &quot;Sister,Sister&quot;, and &quot;So Little Time&quot; (Olsen twins on DVD). She<br/>
watches &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;CSI&quot; with us, and really enjoyed &quot;Sex and the<br/>
City&quot; (pretty ladies in pretty dresses was the attraction). She doesn&#39;t like<br/>
&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; much, and will play off to the side when I am watching it.<br/>
Her DVD choices are all the princess stories from Disney, Angelina<br/>
Ballerina, assorted other Disney stuff (Mary Poppins, Studio Ghibli,<br/>
Atlantis), &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, and the three Barbie computer animated movies in a<br/>
rotating order of preference. The best thing is hearing her sing the theme<br/>
songs.<br/>

one, historically speaking.  I don&#39;t think it was a concept in<br/>
say....Victorian England.....I can&#39;t imagine little Oliver Twist having his<br/>
eyes shielded from things.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it is the society we live in.  In the not so distant past,<br/>
if you wanted to eat something, you killed it, butchered it, used the<br/>
intestines to stuff sausage, etc..  Your family all slept in the same room<br/>
and you had seen lots of animals having sex and probably your parents.<br/>
Animals died, people died....you might have a dead body lying in state in<br/>
your living room for a few days.<br/>

&gt; I think she meant that as soon as you put a show offlimits, that&#39;s all<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll want to watch. I did that with the Simpsons and my 5 year old.<br/>
Guess<br/>
&gt; what was the only show she talked about during that short time? Now she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; free to watch it and rarely does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; I think your husband probably wants to introduce shwos that he remembers<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, I want to express all of my worries about these types of shows and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have you watched this show yet?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   That just seems really strange too - what is that<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The show is only a half hour. And there&#39;s not that much shooting. And it&#39;s<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; cartoon. If they get desensitzed to cartoon violence, oh well. Honestly,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; have more influence over your kids then any TV show ever will.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Honestly, I have always had a distaste for violence in movies and TV.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t understand how people can watch other people being hurt.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; entertainment to me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to gobble up horror flicks. The more gore the better. And no, it<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t because I liked seeing people get hurt. I was enamoured with the<br/>
&gt; special effects. At one point in my teenage years I could name off all the<br/>
&gt; important FX studios and artists (and I collected comic books and I was a<br/>
&gt; girl. Definate geek.). I understood that it was a movie and nobody was<br/>
&gt; getting hurt. So if I hissed, &#39;cooooool&#39;, after a head was parted from its<br/>
&gt; shoulders it was in admiration of someone&#39;s skill with model heads.<br/>
Anyhow,<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t watch it like I used too. All the movies I used to watch didn&#39;t do<br/>
&gt; diddly to desensitize me in the long run and the last horror flick I<br/>
watched<br/>
&gt; had me covering my eyes.<br/>
&gt; That isn&#39;t entertaiment for you, but it is for others...and not for the<br/>
&gt; reasons you assume.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If your young children wanted to watch an adult-rated movie that was<br/>
&gt; really<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daugher has watched Lord of the Rings (at her begging). Her favourite<br/>
&gt; part is the darkest, the Mines of Moria. It&#39;s a pretty violent film but<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s watched the making of documentries on the DVD so she knows what goes<br/>
&gt; into making a Balrog or a good decapitation scene. How has it affected<br/>
her?<br/>
&gt; Legolas is married to her apparently and we&#39;ve had marathon discussions<br/>
&gt; about good and evil. Has it harmed her innocence? I&#39;m not the right one to<br/>
&gt; answer that I think...I don&#39;t really believe in that and think &#39;innocence&#39;<br/>
&gt; is usually code for not talking to children about things that make adults<br/>
&gt; squeamish. It always assume childhood is some blessed state of happiness<br/>
&gt; free from worry and stress. Anyhow, off on a tangent. She&#39;s still the<br/>
sweet,<br/>
&gt; caring girl we&#39;ve always had. I haven&#39;t noticed her running about the<br/>
&gt; neighbourhood slashing at the neighbours with a kitchen knife. :)<br/>
&gt;  I don&#39;t see my role as keeping my kids away from certain things, I see it<br/>
&gt; as making sure they&#39;re equipped to deal with and make choices about those<br/>
&gt; things.<br/>

<br/>
LOL....So you think I worry too much?  You&#39;re right.  I do.  Thank you for <br/>
ever-so-gently pointing that out to me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I told my husband that I had asked &quot;that unschooling group&quot; about the <br/>
situation.  He said, &quot;Well, I am sure I won&#39;t agree with all of their <br/>
responses.&quot;  I told him that you all agreed with him.  He was deliriously <br/>
happy.  You all made my husband deliriously happy for a day.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have taken in all of your points and understand where you are <br/>
coming from.  I was doing really well relaxing with the television until GI <br/>
Joe came out, and then I regressed for awhile.  I was making it all about GI <br/>
Joe when it really wasn&#39;t.  And you are correct about little kids not <br/>
wanting to watch stuff that is too scary for them.  My kids always tell me <br/>
that they don&#39;t want to watch Daddy&#39;s &quot;scary&quot; movies from judging the <br/>
pictures on the cases.  Also, the person that wrote in about how much they <br/>
used to love gory movies helped a lot.  I have never understood people <br/>
watching them or anything violent for that matter, but her insight led me to <br/>
look deeper.<br/>
<br/>
The other day my friend came over and told me that from now on her son was <br/>
not allowed to play in any sort of &quot;violent&quot; way.  Like my son&#39;s toy Turtles <br/>
punching each other, etc.  As soon as he heard his mother tell me that he <br/>
started playing in that way in a really obvious manner and watching for his <br/>
mother&#39;s reaction while she got more and more fed up trying to control the <br/>
toys he could play with (he is almost 5).  Later that day the boy got more <br/>
and more out of control and ended up throwing something at our cat and <br/>
kicking over his food bowl (all the while watching his mother).  She stated <br/>
that he &quot;gets that way&quot; after he has played with these &quot;violent&quot; toys.  To <br/>
me it was plainly obvious that he &quot;gets that way&quot; from being overly <br/>
controlled.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681783928">Hi Erika,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that you are worried about &quot;violence&quot; of GI Joe and Ninja<br/>
Turtles, because those are very PC and super low on bloodshed & such.<br/>
They are really about friendship and loyalty and such. Princess<br/>
Mononoke has way more blood, death and sadness. Btw, my 2 yr old<br/>
daughter loves P.M.<br/>
<br/>
What worries me in most TV programs is the way parents are portayed.<br/>
As clueless, prudish, set in their boring, dumb ways. The parents in<br/>
American made-for-children shows/movies Just Don&#39;t Get It. And the<br/>
mothers especially get the raw end of the deal. <br/>
<br/>
And the shows/moves are generally about a male main character. And<br/>
then of course there are movies like Cinderella. About a pretty girl<br/>
who is just so sweet, kind and innocent, and completely unselfish.<br/>
And the poor thing is Forced To Do Chores! Of course she deserves for<br/>
a nice wealthy young prince to come and save her! And all the other<br/>
female characters are ugly, evil, selfish... I have to say,<br/>
Cinderella bothers me a lot more than Ninja Turtles or Princess<br/>
Mononoke, because of the values it teaches. <br/>
<br/>
And, of course, when watching straight TV, one gets the commercials.<br/>
More portayals of dumb, boring, controlling mothers, and their<br/>
sugar-loving witty & cool kids... *sigh*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915985364">Hi Inna!<br/>
 <br/>
I agree with your summary of typical female characters.  That&#39;s the reason, with few exceptions, my kids really don&#39;t know the characters and stories most of us grew up with.  As more examples, although I&#39;m sure the list doesn&#39;t end here -- &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; to name a few.<br/>
 <br/>
I have one daughter and three sons and refuse to allow my daughter to be taught, if only subconsciously (which is arguably the most dangerous!), that she needs to be rescued/saved because she&#39;s a helpless girl.  Likewise, I don&#39;t want my sons to expect that women are like that and that my sons&#39; role is to come in and rescue/save them so women should be nothing but grateful because where would women be without them?!  Then there&#39;s the whole issue with how parents are portrayed, as you mentioned . . .<br/>
 <br/>
So I try to model strong, female leadership in myself and in the women in my children&#39;s lives.  And I guess it goes without saying that the historical women we study also were strong and played critical roles in history -- otherwise they probably wouldn&#39;t have survived history, right?!  But when we talk about them, I make it a point to stress the challenges they faced, the inner strength they found to get through them, etc.  Of course, I do the same with male role models, but they generally don&#39;t get short-changed by society!<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, big sigh . . .<br/>

courtroom scene in Adam&#39;s Rib (Tracy/Hepburn) where Katharine Hepburn calls <br/>
various accomplished women to the stand. When she asks a particular witness to <br/>

So do you avoid exposing them to real history, and go more toward <br/>
hand-selected non-sexist fantasy-history and revisionist versions of things?  <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s MORE dangerous (no matter who&#39;s doing it or why) than just <br/>
letting them see plain accounts and real fairy tales, but telling them how things <br/>
have changed and why.<br/>
<br/>
Pretending the world is quite other than it is is a dishonesty children can&#39;t <br/>
really benefit from.  The advantage is temporary, I think, and could be <br/>
ultimately more frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
In the early 70&#39;s when Ms. Magazine was new I was quite into the women&#39;s <br/>
movement.  I volunteered in the first rape crisis center in my state.  I had a <br/>
Woman Power t-shirt which Holly wears now (and to those who know me and Holly <br/>
personally: yes, I DID wear t-shirts &quot;size S&quot; in college).  I nearly refused to <br/>
have anything to do with one young obnoxious Mr. Keith Dodd until he finished <br/>
reading Susan Brownmiller&#39;s book on Men, Women and Rape and discussed it with <br/>
me to my satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I&#39;m grateful to that same sexist grew-up-without-sisters guy for many <br/>
services that only a big strong man can so easily provide for a smaller, less <br/>
able female.  It&#39;s not unnatural.  It&#39;s not evil.  It&#39;s not something to shame <br/>
our sons out of, being strong and capable.  Too many boys are being robbed of <br/>
their heritage and their birthright and their instincts.  Isn&#39;t that one <br/>
complaint about the mistreatment of women?  Their natural gifts were belittled <br/>
instead of glorified?  Don&#39;t do that to your sons.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is feeding children a revisionist line of culture, please <br/>
reconsider.  Reality is more powerful than the fantasy of any mom.  Children will live <br/>
in the world, not in mom&#39;s little world.  Let them grow up respecting mom&#39;s <br/>
opinion and perspective, not having to recover from it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604179144">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that you chose to use genders. &quot;Big strong man&quot; and<br/>
&quot;smaller, less able female&quot; - and not &quot;big strong PERSON&quot; and<br/>
&quot;smaller, less able PERSON&quot;. Because isn&#39;t that the real problem here<br/>
- that we are characterizing each gender as able and strong, or not?<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are lots of big strong WOMEN out there, as well as<br/>
smaller, less able MEN. As a shorter, smaller (but NOT less able)<br/>
person, I have learned to find ways to get whatever I need done. But<br/>
I am completely at ease with accepting help, when it is available,<br/>
from someone bigger, stronger and taller than myself, whatever may<br/>
that person&#39;s gender happen to be. <br/>
<br/>
I have also worked as a rape councelor when I was younger. And I have<br/>
read stories where men where raped by women. And it was precisely the<br/>
stereotype of &quot;bigger, stronger, more virile, more able&quot;, that made<br/>
them ashamed and unable to deal with the fact that someone has hurt<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, we live in a world filled with such stereotypes. And there is no<br/>
way to &#39;protect&#39; our kids - and no reason for doing so - but we don&#39;t<br/>
have to partake in the stereotyping. <br/>

Kirby and Marty are big and strong and male.  They just are.<br/>
<br/>
Theyhave one big strong female friend.  She&#39;s also really feminine.  When <br/>
trucks need to be loaded, Sadie&#39;s likely to be asked to help.  Sadie is stronger <br/>
than some of the males in that group.  The group of kids they hang out with <br/>
would nevver say &quot;Let us males go and oad the truk while the females make us <br/>
lunch.&quot;  None of them are that way.  Two of the best cooks we know are men, and <br/>
the kids have known them since they were born.<br/>
<br/>
Stereotyping is not as much a problem as it was when some of us were kids.  <br/>
Going extremely reactionary doesn&#39;t help.  It&#39;s just another irritation which <br/>
doesn&#39;t respect boys and men.<br/>
<br/>
Destroying the self image of big strong boys and men doesn&#39;t help the image <br/>
of girls and women.<br/>

If your young children wanted to watch an adult-rated movie that was really <br/>
violent, would you let them watch it?  Isn&#39;t it the role of a parent to make <br/>
sure that children are not exposed to this at too young of an age?  What <br/>
about protecting their innocence while they are young?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My eight year old and I were watching Jesus Christ Superstar the other day. <br/>
We had listened to the CD a few days before, and I got the movie because he <br/>
asked me to. He knew that there were 39 lashes----he&#39;d counted with Pilate on the <br/>
CD. But when the flogging was coming up, he asked to leave the room. Instead, <br/>
I just fast-forwarded through the flogging. HE KNEW he wasn&#39;t ready to watch <br/>
that! <br/>
 <br/>
We later discussed how they wouldn&#39;t actually whip an actor---that it was <br/>
just a special effect (in fact, during the overture, thre&#39;s a guy flogging the <br/>
plexiglass prop and making it bleed). <br/>
 <br/>
I *could* have made him sit and watch. I *could* have made him cover his <br/>
eyes. I *could * have never even brought the movie home. I *could* have done a lot <br/>
of things. But because he knew what he could handle, we did it *his* way. <br/>
 <br/>
Most children don&#39;t want to see people or animals hurt. Nor do they care to <br/>
watch sex scenes. They naturally shy away from both those things. Young <br/>
children who actively seek out those things may have other problems. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There are some stages of life that little kids don&#39;t need to know anything <br/>
about.  <br/>
<br/>
Innocence is as natural as any other progression in live and learning.<br/>

<br/>
There are levels of violence that are not fun for some people.  Some people <br/>
have a very low violence threshhold and will claim a headache if they watch too <br/>
much Tweetie and Sylvester.  Others are okay with Vietnam movies or horror <br/>
extravaganzas.   Most fall somewhere in between.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think all TV violence is to be avoided, or that it&#39;s evil, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s all equally hunky dory.<br/>
<br/>
Sheltering people is okay.   Someone was shot so close to my house that if I <br/>
had known it had happened I could have seen the body from the back gate.  <br/>
Keith saw the police cars all out there the next morning.   I was told the details <br/>
by someone who had to witness the scene for the DA&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think telling my kids would have been cool.  I don&#39;t think running up <br/>
there and looking would have been nice.  I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t show 90 seconds <br/>
of close-up, scanning video on the news.  That kind of sheltering is fine.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents protecting innocence is fine, but too many people harm their <br/>
kids in the name of protection.<br/>

<br/>
******************<br/>
<br/>
Oh THANK YOU for saying this.  And might I add that ignorance in *any* form is *dangerous*.<br/>
<br/>
I have held off telling this story, but I will now.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, while my 9 year old daughter and her cousins were sleeping in our cabin, a man snuck into their room and starting touching one of my nieces.  My husband was asleep on the living room couch and I was at home sleeping in my own bed.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter saw what was going on, had enough presence of mind to scare the guy off, then took herself and the girls out to the truck where she could lock the doors, and when she couldn&#39;t get hold of me, she used the cell phone to call the police and had the guy arrested.  At the age of *nine*.  <br/>
<br/>
(She didn&#39;t see her dad sleeping on the sofa or she would have woke him up first :o)).<br/>
<br/>
Amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t go out of my way to expose her to these possibilites in real life.  I also didn&#39;t go out of my way to &quot;protect her innocence&quot;.  I *did* give her a lot of information as things came up in movies, tv programs, etc, and because she has friends who live in rough families.<br/>
<br/>
As scared as she was, she knew what to do and *that* is what is most important to me.<br/>
<br/>
Later we discovered this same guy had also approached my older daughter earlier in the evening and offered her alcohol and cigarettes if she would come with him in a dark corner in the woods behind the cabin. <br/>
<br/>
Although she had been sneaking Mike&#39;s lemonaides that evening, she dumped the one out that *this* guy gave her because she thought it was odd that a grown man was offering her alcohol.  Not only that, but she *kept* the bottle, and the police have it now. She also did NOT go with him to smoke that cigarette she wanted because she recognized the &quot;weird feeling&quot; she got and paid attention to it.<br/>
<br/>
I think this demonstrates a few important things.  First, my kids can talk to me because they aren&#39;t punished.  I knew it was possible they were sneaking the alcohol and when I asked them about it, they were honest.  I knew they snuck cigarettes too, because they told me.  So they had nothing to hide in what they told me and no reason to embellish either.<br/>
<br/>
Second, they were not overexposed or overprotected and they had as much information as they needed whenever they asked.<br/>
<br/>
But most importantly, because they are allowed to say &quot;no&quot;,  they were able to recognize, acknowledge, and ACT on the strange feelings they got from an adult, and as a result they kept themselves and others safer from harm than they might otherwise have been.<br/>

<br/>
*********************************<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this too.  I think it really depends on the individual child, and what their level of interest is and where they are developmentally.<br/>
<br/>
There was a movie on one of the Encore channels once that had some very violent scenes in it.  I didn&#39;t know that when I had it on.  I was just watching it one afternoon out of boredom.  Honestly, the scenes are still disturbing to me as I recall them.  JUST when one of the first of these scenes was on my youngest daughter walked in, before I had a chance to turn it off.  To this day I regret that either of us had seen it.  It just wasn&#39;t necessary and it was total overexposure.  And I felt awful that this was an image she would have in her mind for a long time, if not the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Imposed&quot; innocence to me is when we try to extend their innocent ignorance beyond what they want by not discussing things they want to discuss, and not exposing them to information (or tv programming if thats what they want) because *we* don&#39;t want to consider the possibility that they really might be ok with some of it, albeit with guidance and in a safe environment.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think that happens more when kids are thinking on a more conscious level than a 2 or 3 year old who happens to wander in while we are watching a disturbing movie.<br/>

Sometimes its a hard balance to walk.  I *think* I&#39;ve done ok but I know in erring on the side of freedom, that there have been times the kids have seen things I wished they hadn&#39;t  because they are up later than I am and they have the tv on and I&#39;m not there.  On the other hand, we do discuss those things.  They tell me about their feelings, and we talk about it.  And thats when I can give them information, reassure them that they are safe, and help them empower themselves to stay safe in my absence.<br/>

I have erred on the side of freedom too. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
There have been a few things that Alex has seen that<br/>
he really would rather not have. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago he clicked on a link in a joke<br/>
type website that had you look at a innocent looking<br/>
picture of a kitchen, and then the Linda Blair image<br/>
from Exorcist flashes on the screen. <br/>
<br/>
 It really scared him, he started screaming. He hates<br/>
horror movies, shock value type stuff.  I still wonder<br/>
what he thought was going to happen, I guess he didn&#39;t<br/>
think it through. <br/>
<br/>
I spent quite some time talking to him about his<br/>
experience, how people LIKE that feeling of being<br/>
scared, how there was no warning because then it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have the same effect, how it&#39;s an image that<br/>
was crafted in order to scare, but that it wasn&#39;t real<br/>
(it helped that I found pictures on the net of her in<br/>
the bed having makeup applied, with the camera<br/>
visible, and pictures of her without makeup, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I also gently reminded him that he chose to click on<br/>
that link, that we can&#39;t always be sure we&#39;ll be safe<br/>
from things that scare us, or worry us, online.  <br/>
<br/>
He is much more careful on the net.  I remind him that<br/>
I can always check stuff out for him first, but he has<br/>
to take me up on that. He does put Yahoo! search on<br/>
safe mode cause he doesn&#39;t like anything sexual<br/>
either, and that&#39;s *rampant* on the net. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish I could take that one moment back,<br/>
that was so traumatic, but I see, also, so much that<br/>
he learned from that experience. <br/>
<br/>
 It is definitely a balancing act.  Even tho it is our<br/>
job to protect our children, we can&#39;t always do so. <br/>
Then our job is to help them heal and recover and<br/>
process the experience as best they can, and to help<br/>
them move on.  I hope I did that.  <br/>
<br/>
He still remembers it tho, and will talk about it<br/>
every once in a while. <br/>
<br/>
He will occasionally watch a very bad horror movie<br/>
with obviously bad special effects, with me, and we<br/>
laugh together about how stupid it is. lol Progress? <br/>
<br/>
He still doesn&#39;t like scary movies, tho.  He says he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like that feeling.  But roller coasters are an<br/>
ok scary, sometimes.  ;-) <br/>
