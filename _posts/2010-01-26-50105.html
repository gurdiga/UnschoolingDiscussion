<div id="ygrps-yiv-717799192">I have been reading quietly on this group for over a year now.  While I still struggle with some aspects of unschooling, we have come a long way.<br/>
<br/>
I am struggling today with a question from my 5 year old ds.  While at the chiropractors office today, the chiro was talking with my son about popeye and spinach and how it&#39;s good to eat veggies etc.  They had an interesting chat, and my son loves broccoli and sweet potatoes which she thought was so great.  However, then he said that he really likes candy too, and that we have tons in our house.  To which she said, yes candy is good, but only at halloween.  She also said, &quot;well, I&#39;m sure your mom doesn&#39;t let you eat too much candy&quot;.  We were leaving, so this was the end of the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
In the car on the way home, my son asked about this.  He is aware that many parents limit how much candy/when, and he&#39;s never really worried about this.  But, I think he really trusts and likes the chiropractor, so I think he&#39;s feeling very confused at the moment.  Candy is something I still struggle with, on and off, so I am feeling nervous about answering his question.  I did tell him that he knows what his body needs, but I know this didn&#39;t satisfy him and I&#39;m pretty sure this will come up again, probably late tonight when I&#39;m exhausted and not thinking straight.  He did specifically ask me if I wanted him to eat candy - which really threw me...<br/>
<br/>
So, what would you tell him?  And, should I have redirected this conversation?  My son and I did talk previously about how the dentist might tell him not to eat candy, but because he didn&#39;t yet know the dentist I think he was okay with that.  I imagine similar conflicts will come up though throughout his life though.</div>

Maybe you could simply say you want him to make his own choices, based  <br/>
on what he learns and what he believes as he grows up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell him you think too many rules and too much fear  <br/>
are both worse for people than too much candy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6357005">I don&#39;t know if this makes sense, but I&#39;d tell him nothing. At all. If he<br/>
really was all that bothered about if sweets were good for him, he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be waiting there for a suggestion (I imagine). He&#39;d probably try out giving<br/>
them up, eating them on Halloween, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I&#39;d just like someone to act on certain reactions one way or the<br/>
other &quot;DO SOMETHING&quot; kind of thing. That is possibly because I often react<br/>
when commented on whether I need to or not.<br/>
