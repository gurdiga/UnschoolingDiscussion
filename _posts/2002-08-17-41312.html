&lt;&lt; There was a war here and I sometimes feel the hurt, pain, and anger of my <br/>
 native people since moving to this place. I hope someday to have a vision <br/>
 quest. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I love your posts Kim. Such honesty and openess.....<br/>
I am also drawn to my native roots, though my family isn&#39;t sure of the tribe. <br/>
Ojibwa most likely (I had thought it was Cherokee all this time). I have a <br/>
book I think you should get, it&#39;s called &quot;Wisdom Keepers&quot; and has words of <br/>
wisdom from leaders of various tribes.<br/>
It&#39;s beautiful, inspiring and very real. Some of them have a lot of anger <br/>
towards white people (understandably) and the words are so honest.<br/>
Great photos too.<br/>
I love your dream with the eagle. I&#39;m working towards my falconry permit, so <br/>
I have a pull towards birds of prey that is very strong.<br/>
Keep the faith girl, follow your heart, it&#39;s leading you home.<br/>
