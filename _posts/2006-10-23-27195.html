<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086235051">Greetings!<br/>
   <br/>
  There is a new group in Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland geared towards unschoolers, and radical unschoolers in particular.<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PGCountyUnschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PGCountyUnschoolers/</a><br/>
   <br/>
  This is a local group and it is meant to be an on AND offline support group for unschoolers in and around PG county.  So be prepared not only to chat online, but also to meet and greet.<br/>
   <br/>
  If you are an unschooler (and especially a radical unschooler) please join us in connecting, sharing, and forming a community for each other as we grow and learn with our children.<br/>
   <br/>
  To learn more about unschooling and see if this group is right for you, please visit the following links.  If you vibe with what they are saying then come and join PG Unschoolers......<br/>
