<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369725132">Hi,<br/>
I think the Pink Floyd picture with some kind of unschooled title (can&#39;t <br/>
think of any of the suggestions) would be great for those of us who are <br/>
already unschoolers.  However, I think we are often viewed negatively by <br/>
many public and school-at-homers.  So, for them how about a more sedate <br/>
cover and title?  I was thinking a sunlit, wooded path with a title like <br/>
&quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;.  (I doubt you need permission from Robert Frost).  <br/>
Would it be possible to use different covers/titles based on the target <br/>
audience?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534874030">Hi Olivia,<br/>
<br/>
I would even turn on the tv to record Oprah if we were on it!  Thank <br/>
you for your book title suggestions. I think we&#39;ve almost decided on <br/>
one though. Laurie came up with the one I like best.  The rough draft <br/>
is finished and Laurie will spend two weeks with me (starting May <br/>
14th) to help me polish it up... then off to publishers! I haven&#39;t <br/>
found a publisher yet and I have some decisions to make, but <br/>
hopefully it will all be happening soon. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can gently persuade Oprah?  I think the bond between Laurie <br/>
and me is obvious. Hopefully she&#39;ll see that.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; cover and title?  I was thinking a sunlit, wooded path with a title<br/>
&gt;   like<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot;.  (I doubt you need permission from Robert<br/>
&gt;   Frost).<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Would it be possible to use different covers/titles based on the<br/>
&gt;   target<br/>
&gt;   &gt; audience?<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt;  &gt;  prefix implies the undoing of something and I never went to<br/>
&gt;   school<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;  so<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;  &gt;  there&#39;s no damage to be undone.  I think that nonschooled is<br/>
&gt;   more<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;  &gt;  appropriate in my case.  Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;      I understand what you mean.  There are times when I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   even want<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;word school to be in any form of how we describe our way of life.<br/>
&gt;   But<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;unschooling is a term that some people recognize.  I did think of<br/>
&gt;   the old<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;commercial about 7-up, the uncola...I don&#39;t know if nonschooled is<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;grammatically correct (if that matters; afterall, English is a<br/>
&gt;   pretty<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;fluid,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;changing language anyway) but it does seem more accurate.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;   the &quot;life<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;without school&quot; would be better...or even something that conveyed<br/>
&gt;   the same<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;thought without putting school in the title at all, like learning<br/>
&gt;   in<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;freedom,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;or .... This brainstorming of a title is fun...<br/>

  Hi Valerie:<br/>
<br/>
  I have been enjoying your posts! For a book title, how about  &quot;Learning <br/>
  Without Walls&quot; or &quot;Growing Without Walls&quot; or something like that? How much <br/>
  have you written so far? (Did I miss that post already?)<br/>
<br/>
  BTW, I think I can picture you taking on Oprah. I would even plug the TV <br/>
  back in to see that!<br/>
  :-)<br/>

  &gt;I understand where you are coming from Mary, but there is already a<br/>
  &gt;book titled &quot;The Road Less Traveled.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I have been told by a few writer friends that I should do this my<br/>
  &gt;way, not take creative writing courses and not worry about what<br/>
  &gt;others think...(in other words...pretend my parents won&#39;t be reading<br/>
  &gt;it..lol).  This is going to be a difficult decision. I won&#39;t to &#39;be<br/>
  &gt;myself&#39; since it is biographical, but I also want to appeal to the<br/>
  &gt;masses...and hope to OPEN some eyes...<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;love, Valerie<br/>
