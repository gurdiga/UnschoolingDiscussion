No, it&#39;s not! It is typical American presumption, but it is not <br/>
ethnocentrism. <br/>
<br/>
Calling it &quot;ethnocentrism&quot; sure *sounds good*. Indeed, it&#39;s almost as <br/>
effective as calling someone a racist. But that too would have made no sense <br/>
in this case. So to me it just added fuel to the fire you appear to be <br/>
wanting to extinguish.<br/>

Why do you say that?<br/>
It had to do with American sensitivities and assumptions.<br/>

I don&#39;t mean to make a mountain out of mole hill. My point is that America <br/>
and presumptuous Americans don&#39;t constitute an ethnic group. Americans are <br/>
not a race per se, nor is American imperialism an ethnic imperialism.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with what you say about American presumption and how it expresses <br/>
itself on the international stage, but Ned&#39;s thoughts have nothing to do with <br/>
ethnicity or race.<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  I see the objection.  <br/>
<br/>
The term still applies even when it&#39;s not an ethnic difference but a cultural <br/>
difference.  And there IS an American culture.  If the root of the word is <br/>
technically not what it ended up being, it can join the majority of living <br/>
language then.<br/>
<br/>
The worst example of this ethnocentrism is 18th and 19th century England.  <br/>
When the sun never set on the British Empire, they also were absolutely <br/>
certain that they were the epitome of civilization and all other cultures <br/>
were ignorant, backward, primitive, stone-age, etc.  It shows in their <br/>
writings about language, folklore, clothing, religion, medicine--all the way <br/>
down the line, if they found something impressive they wanted to put it in <br/>
the British Museum and raise their flag over it.<br/>
<br/>
Our whole &quot;Western Civilization&quot; history comes from their very strange view <br/>
of English history, I think, where they meander back and put their <br/>
history-class flag on Renaissance Italy, Rome, Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia.  <br/>
The history of their culture?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
A smokescreen for the fact that by the time they got back to Rome the English <br/>
were spear-using, skin-wearing folk?<br/>
<br/>
Quite likely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; but Ned&#39;s thoughts have nothing to do with <br/>
ethnicity or race.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No they don&#39;t.    And I didn&#39;t mean that by &quot;ethnocentricity&quot; either.<br/>

ethnicity. But the dictionary says &quot;characterized by or based on the<br/>
attitude that one&#39;s own group is superior.&quot;<br/>
