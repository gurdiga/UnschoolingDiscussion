&gt; On the other hand, my brother&#39;s first wife was unschooled and she couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; read until she was 14.  Her mother didn&#39;t do anything to try to make their<br/>
&gt; lives interesting (like trips to libraries or museums or whatever.)  5 of her<br/>
&gt; kids had no problem this way but my sis in law did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not reading until 14 isn&#39;t an automatic indicator that unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
working. It may be that that is the age she was ready to learn, and there&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with it, nor any reason she couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t learn a great<br/>
deal as a non-reader.<br/>
<br/>
Did your brother&#39;s former wife ever say what her mother did do instead of<br/>
what she didn&#39;t? Neither the library nor the museum is the deal-breaker for<br/>
unschooling &quot;success&quot; and maybe with six kids and a rich home environment<br/>
(?) the woman felt life was interesting enough already. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying pick at nits, I just always wonder a little at how factual<br/>
the myths of wolf-unschooling families are.<br/>
<br/>
Was your brother&#39;s first wife an uninteresting person? And if so, can we<br/>
blame it on unschooling, or was it her personality to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a ridiculous eager-to-learn optomist despite schooling. I imagine there<br/>
are people who are natural plodders and pessimistic, even with the benefit<br/>
of unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you are picking and it has given me some things to think about. <br/>
 I know her mother did get very sick when she was about 10 and the two <br/>
youngest had the hardest time learning new things.  I don&#39;t know if her mom <br/>
even knew there was such a thing as &quot;unschooling.&quot;  We as kids thought they <br/>
had the best mom ever to such an extent that my mom was a bit jealous.  It <br/>
must have been fun but now 17 yrs later I can&#39;t really remember what we did <br/>
there.<br/>
