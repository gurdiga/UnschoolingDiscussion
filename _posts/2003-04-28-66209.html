When I was breatfeeding Nicholas I nursed in Walmart, the Mall, the grocery <br/>
store you name it.  For the first 6 months Nicholas was in sling/pouch and I <br/>
nursed from that. Heck he nursed nonstop there is no way I would have been <br/>
able to leave my home if I couldn&#39;t nurse in public. Bathrooms are no place <br/>
for a baby anyway yuck! I wonder if that man had a wife or a child for that <br/>
matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126469751">I am shocked by this! Ugh, can you believe that we still live in a society that only views women&#39;s breasts sexually! With my first two I was really hesitant to nurse out in public, always shy and trying to hide everything. With Nora (baby #3, who is 5 months now) I was three weeks postpartum shopping three days before Xmas at a major mall in Massachusetts. I had no sling and was totally exposed and I didn&#39;t care. Even dh was like, &quot;Ah, honey do you want to move to a more private bench:) &quot; but I didnt care, here I was with my new baby feeding her and loving her and life was good! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920996196">What&#39;s obnoxious is when a mother is being discreet, with a nursing <br/>
blouse or a blanket over the baby, nothing exposed. With one of those <br/>
side-opening nursing blouses, you have to look twice to see that a <br/>
baby is nursing. And yet, the sideways glances and underbreath <br/>
mutterings. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been breastfeeding one child, the other or both for almost 9 years <br/>
now.  I have never had a negative reaction.  Not even when we were flying <br/>
home from Germany and my 3 year old and 6 month old were tandem <br/>
nursing/sleeping on and off on the plane.  Everyone thought it was soooo <br/>
cute.  Although maybe they were just glad that my boys weren&#39;t screaming.  <br/>
