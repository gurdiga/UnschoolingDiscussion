&lt;&lt; In an article in the new Home Education Magazine, Liza Sabater was <br/>
describing <br/>
 the package and way of life school becomes for people:   &quot;With school come <br/>
 friends and peers; elders and role models; the time for learning and the <br/>
time <br/>
 for doing everything else.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing this up. I had meant to say &quot;Way to go Liza!!&quot;<br/>
Loved your article. I am loaning my copy of HEM to a friend that just started <br/>
homeschooling this year and is really having a hard time relaxing.<br/>
Great read.<br/>

I can add them to the article when it&#39;s online.  That one didn&#39;t make HEM&#39;s <br/>
online cut this month, so I get to put it up myself!  I can put a PS or a <br/>
second comments page, or something and say &quot;Mary Gold says to watch THESE <br/>
movies instead:&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634578544">Thanks Mary!<br/>
<br/>
I replied to this earlier but wanted to make sure you read this. It&#39;s <br/>
been incredible. We came back from the AMNH and Central Park. We went <br/>
looking for dioramas of volcanos but ended up looking at dinosaurs <br/>
because the kids found the Earth gallery much too scary --isn&#39;t that <br/>
weird? They are not freaked out by a 3 stories-high skeleton but will <br/>
freak by igneous rocks. I do have to say that it was because the <br/>
gallery was dark and it had this deep, low, humming sound that WAS <br/>
kinda creepy. Noises, not images will freak out Evan more these days. <br/>
Even though I hope it will pass, it goes to show that the dingbats at <br/>
the museum do not know what they are doing. There are sections that <br/>
are truly NOT kid-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it has been a year and for the first time in a year I feel <br/>
that, yes, we are actually unschooling. Evan wants to learn how to <br/>
write all these intriguing words he has learned like <br/>
&quot;excavation&quot;,&quot;carnosaur&quot; and such. He really wants to read, so he can <br/>
stop asking us to read the instructions on his CD-ROM and webgames. <br/>
And Aidan is fascinated with the I SPY books  and money so we are <br/>
doing a lot of I SPY in English and Spanish and a lot of counting and <br/>
sorting. Even at 2.5, they know what they want and how to accomplish <br/>
it. It&#39;s so damn cute to hear him go, &quot;Mom, COME. Sit here, READ! If <br/>
it is an I SPY book I have him *read* it. So he starts *reading*. <br/>
Then Evan joins in and I leave because now, the two of them are <br/>
*reading*  together. It is so AWESOME!<br/>
<br/>
Before I bought the &quot;Hey, I&#39;m Reading&quot; book, I had told Evan that <br/>
before reading words he could learn how to read images. Well, after <br/>
we got the aforementioned book, it validated what I had told him and <br/>
boy, now he just does not stop reading signs. That&#39;s why both love <br/>
the I SPY books (they both can read them, right?); and that&#39;s why he <br/>
can&#39;t wait to learn how to read more words. One thing I love about <br/>
NYC is the NY Public Library --we have resources galore.  DK <br/>
Publishing has the &quot;Eyewitness&quot; Nature & Science Books and Video <br/>
series. The library has virtually all of them and what is great is <br/>
that you can take out both the video and the book. So we watch the <br/>
videos (I&#39;m a sucker for nature documentaries) and then at night or <br/>
during down time we read the books. And in them we get all sorts of <br/>
ideas for projects and what not. Let&#39;s say, it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
This, I truly believe, would not have been possible if I had not had <br/>
that &quot;A-HA!&quot; moment about deschooling. The whole topic came up in the <br/>
writers list at HEM and that&#39;s how it ended as an article. I am sure, <br/>
given the amount of input I had from veteran homeschoolers, that it <br/>
will be as helpful to others as it has been to me. Writing that <br/>
article really calmed me down.<br/>
<br/>

Too bad Mark is not here (see my previous post). He called earlier <br/>
and said was fine  --I just hope nothing stupid happens tomorrow or <br/>
later, especially in Europe (where he is right now). Anyhow, it&#39;s not <br/>
just that we are proud of this first year but, really, I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine NOT homeschooling and, at that, unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37386079">I just read this message! (I have been lurking so some of these have <br/>
escaped my radar).<br/>
<br/>
I had a blast writing that article because of the amount of input I <br/>
got from all the homeschooling lists (or communities) I posted to. <br/>
Reading people&#39;s deschooling stories really put things into <br/>
perspective and just calmed us down (Mark was the first reader of the <br/>
article). Now, it is real and not a theory that every single moment <br/>
of out lives is a learning experience. That&#39;s why, although I do not <br/>
post a lot, I love lurking, like a cat, and pouncing at topics once <br/>
in a while. It&#39;s fun and it&#39;s all part of the process.<br/>
