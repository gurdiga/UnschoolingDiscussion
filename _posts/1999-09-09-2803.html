&gt;It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Unitarian Universalist we encourage constant questioning of religious<br/>
beliefs. We have no set dogma or creed other than that the inherent worth<br/>
and dignity of all people, the right to exercise the democratic process, the<br/>
interdependent web of all life, the right to search for that which holds the<br/>
truth for the individual, the right to live in a peaceful and just world.<br/>
The kids explore all of the world&#39;s religions in their Sunday School class<br/>
and discuss how they relate to UU and if the beliefs are what they could<br/>
believe.  I don&#39;t think that being taught to search and question what is<br/>
right for you and to question what other people believe as &quot;the authority&quot;<br/>
would cause any conflict in unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429862626">Hi<br/>
I just had to add my comments to this.� My daughter is 5 1/2, spent 2 days a week for two<br/>
months in &quot;preschool&quot; when she was 3 1/2, she was miserable and it broke my heart.� I took<br/>
her out much to the objections of my employer at the time and my husband, but I felt like<br/>
an elephant had been lifted off my chest when it was done.� At that point I decided I was<br/>
not going to make decisions about my child that did not feel right.� Sending her to school<br/>
does not feel right.� Why do other people feel it is okay to comment on how you are raising<br/>
your child, but it is not acceptable to tell a person to get out of something dangerous (an<br/>
abusive relationship, mishandling weapons, abusing substances, not managing illness or<br/>
disease, etc.,)?� Does that make any kind of sense?<br/>
We are experiencing a kind of &quot;outlanders&quot; status with soccer parents right now.� &quot;We do<br/>
everything early, because everybody else&#39;s kids have to get up early for school.&quot;� Excuse<br/>
me, is that my problem, maybe that is why at 5 pm your kids are having huge meltdowns!<br/>
It&#39;s a strange world.� Very humorous from my vantage point.� At least sometimes, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Okay everyone, ponder this.� DS went to day camp for a week this summer at<br/>
&gt; the church wher I work.� I was busy that week and not around much.� The<br/>
&gt; woman I work with has reservations about this HS thing so she was watching<br/>
&gt; him pretty closly, thinking that he has to be missing something important<br/>
&gt; and how will he ever learn to get along with other kids.� So after the week<br/>
&gt; she tells me she was really concerned about him because he didn&#39;t come in<br/>
&gt; and talk to her like the other kids.� I say so what was he doing and she<br/>
&gt; says well he spent all his time with Zach (one of his PS friends)� I say so<br/>
&gt; did Zach come in and talk to you? Well, no.� so does that make you think<br/>
&gt; there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with Zach?� Well, no - but that&#39;s different.<br/>
&gt; (Hmm - Why?)<br/>
&gt; So I told her that They really hadn&#39;t had much time together this summer and<br/>
&gt; they were just enjoying each other&#39;s company. And if Zach hadn&#39;t been there<br/>
&gt; I was sure he would have made friends with some other kids, (because he has<br/>
&gt; in similar situations) but he just didn&#39;t need to with Zach around. Seemed<br/>
&gt; like pretty independant behavior to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The really amazing thing was there was another boy their same age that they<br/>
&gt; tried to interact with.� His mother was along for the week and he was a real<br/>
&gt; pain, hanging on her, arguing about where they were going to sit on the bus,<br/>
&gt; wanting all of her attention, etc and not interacting with the other kids at<br/>
&gt; all - but no one questioned his behavior.� (Except his mom - he was making<br/>
&gt; her crazy)� I can only imagine what the response would have been had I gone<br/>
&gt; along and my DS had acted like that.� I wonder why people set up different<br/>
&gt; standards for homeschooled kids?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else experienced anything like that?<br/>

That&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it?  Once you begin to think out of the box, you just get <br/>
a new POV on everything, don&#39;t you?   I love it!!!!!<br/>
