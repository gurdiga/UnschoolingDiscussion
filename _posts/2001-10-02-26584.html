<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some commercial repellants that claim to be safe but try this -<br/>
put orange peels around where ever you don&#39;t want the cats.  Most cats<br/>
will leave, they hate the smell.  (Of course, I have one weird one who<br/>
will eat them but we are just strange here!)<br/>
