Yes, this idea is familiar to me. I believed that same thing many years ago.<br/>
the &quot;structure&quot; lasted one hour the first day, and three minutes on the<br/>
second day, when my kid looked at me and said, &quot;Dad, this is stupid.&quot;  I<br/>
agreed, and we put all the &quot;structure&quot; back in the box and sent it back to<br/>
Calvert, and went out and played, permanently.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s sure that spelling and math are what the kid needs to be &quot;taught&quot;<br/>
then let him say exactly what information he means, and then let him try to<br/>
teach it to the boy. My bet is that your son will have the same response as<br/>
mine did. <br/>
