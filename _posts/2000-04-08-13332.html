have some relatives like this. Now that my kids are old enough to get it, I<br/>
sometimes ask them to hold off on things like candy before dinner at<br/>
grandma&#39;s house because I don&#39;t want my poor restricted nieces and nephews<br/>
to feel bad. It&#39;s not their fault that their parents have those rules and<br/>
it&#39;s often not worth the family hassle to make them go crying to their<br/>
parents &quot;But Quinn gets to!&quot;  My kids can understand this and it&#39;s usually<br/>
no big deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996985258">There is a natural desire for sugar and fat that may be stronger in <br/>
some people, innately, than in others.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yo will almost always choose salad over any other food. She&#39;d <br/>
rather nibble on a bag of lettuce than a bag of chips almost any time. <br/>
We&#39;ll stop at a coffeeshop for desert - everyone else will order pie or <br/>
cheesecake and she&#39;ll order a small dinner salad. And -she doesn&#39;t soak <br/>
it in dressing either - it is the lettuce and cucumbers she likes.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 yo will always order cheesecake. Often would ask for a chicken <br/>
fried steak and gravy to go along with it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My 18 yo will go for chips every time. When she goes to the grocery <br/>
store, that&#39;s what she comes home with - bags of tortilla chips. Nobody <br/>
else usually touches them.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that their eating interests are REALLY different - raised <br/>
in the same house with no food restrictions and they are not all <br/>
equally healthy in their choices. Sometimes it sounds like people here <br/>
think that kids left on their own will always make only perfectly <br/>
healthy food choices, but that isn&#39;t my observation for most kids. So - <br/>
if a parent wants them to ONLY eat healthy foods -no sweets, no high <br/>
fat foods, no salty snacks, then I think you&#39;d have to restrict what is <br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
What IS true, though, is that kids won&#39;t ONLY eat those less nutritious <br/>
foods....given freedom to choose -  they will also eat lots of good <br/>
healthy foods.<br/>
<br/>
When people say they gave their kids freedom to choose and it didn&#39;t <br/>
work - I think maybe their expectations are too high - they think the <br/>
kids are going to pass up the cookies, candy, salty snacks, and sodas <br/>
all the time - always choosing the spinach and broccoli instead.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids will. My 12 yo eats incredibly healthy - really always <br/>
chooses fruits and vegetables over anything else.  What is more likely <br/>
is that they&#39;ll choose a diet that is slightly higher in junk foods <br/>
than their parents might have chosen for them if they&#39;d restricted <br/>
them. BUT - no food battles and no creating food &quot;issues&quot; in the kids <br/>
as they grow up! How cool is that!!<br/>

<br/>
If I were to sit down and write out my ideal of what a person would eat<br/>
every day, that&#39;s not my daughters (or me or my husband, for that matter).<br/>
<br/>
Just as an unschooled child will not at all necessarily start spontaneously<br/>
&quot;doing school&quot; an undietregulated &lt;g&gt; child will not at all necessarily<br/>
start spontaneously ignoring all or most or many sweets and fats.<br/>
<br/>
The rewards of not controlling someone else&#39;s very personal eating wants and<br/>
needs are, in my opinion, well worth seeing a child eating ice cream for<br/>
breakfast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7662659">Just for example, we probably spend way too much on food, even though some<br/>
meals are really cheap, like beans and rice.  We do about 1/2 the shopping<br/>
at costco and get chips in gross. (and the other 1/2 at the co-op, which<br/>
seems at odds, but works for us!)  The kids (at 5 and 10) have a lot of<br/>
things they can make for themselves.  They can get yogurts from the fridge,<br/>
they can make a plate of chips and salsa, they can get cut-up veggies and<br/>
dip....They know where they cookies and the nutella and the bread are....but<br/>
when they say &quot;Mom, I&#39;d like shrimp scampi, or ribs (my 5 yo is such a<br/>
carnivore!), or coffee cake, &quot; I just cook it for them, or teach them<br/>
how.....When DH is home, he cooks for them as well.....<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;unfooding&quot;, I imagine it would be the same as an unschooling<br/>
period....of course you would have to let them have a period where they just<br/>
got everything out of their systems, so to speak.  And they may go crazy<br/>
until they realize it&#39;s not going anywhere....and it may drive you<br/>
crazy....so, take a chill pill and good luck! ;)<br/>

&gt; &gt;You won&#39;t get that choice forever - my kids do our grocery shopping<br/>
&gt; &gt;some of the time, these days. Do you never take the kids shopping with<br/>
&gt; &gt;you? Do they not ask for anything? Do you just say no to their<br/>
&gt; &gt;requests? Anybody who goes to the grocery store here will always ask as<br/>
&gt; &gt;they&#39;re walking out the door if anybody wants anything in particular.<br/>
&gt; &gt;(When I&#39;m in the grocery store, my cell phone sometimes rings 2 or 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;times - someone with a request they just thought of.) Two out of three<br/>
&gt; &gt;times it&#39;ll be: &quot;Get grapes&quot; or &quot;Get good tomatoes&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t forget<br/>
&gt; &gt;cucumbers.&quot; But - last time it was a chorus of &quot;GET ICE CREAM!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;s because I never do - I&#39;m allergic to milk and I tend to forget<br/>

<br/>
Budget is always a factor.<br/>
They can&#39;t eat what you don&#39;t buy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I can&#39;t afford to buy <br/>
everything they say they have to have at the grocery store&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  Why say that?<br/>
<br/>
When we tell people we&#39;ll let kids play all the video games they want, <br/>
someone seems invariably to say &quot;I can&#39;t afford to buy every video game that <br/>
comes out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHAT?  How can it follow from &quot;we don&#39;t limit them&quot; that they own every video <br/>
game in the whole world?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; At home, when they want <br/>
food that needs to be prepared, do you just drop whatever your doing to <br/>
rush into the kitchen to make what they want?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The tone of the question already seems to show that you think we&#39;re dopes, <br/>
but I&#39;m having a bad few days with questions on another list, so I&#39;ll admit <br/>
the sensitivity is likely on my end.<br/>
<br/>
I very rarely &quot;drop whatever I&#39;m doing and rush into the kitchen.&quot;<br/>
I very frequently make or help them make something special if they want it.<br/>
More frequently, they decide to want what they can eat without much <br/>
preparation or what they can make themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a matter of offering every food on earth at all times.  It&#39;s not <br/>
shaming them or measuring food or forcing food or saying &quot;THIS food is good <br/>
for you, and THAT food is worthless crap that will turn you into a garbage <br/>
bin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very often parents who give those messages are wrong anyway, and just <br/>
reacting to internal shaming they themselves got in years past.<br/>
<br/>
The cycle doesn&#39;t end until someone ends it consciously.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Please know I&#39;m not being judgmental or condescending.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you meant to be, but the phrases you chose did seem to indicate <br/>
you don&#39;t think much of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I truly<br/>
understand the overall concept of &quot;free-range&quot; children.  I&#39;m just <br/>
trying to picture it in our lives.  Are we supposed to go through a <br/>
transitional period where the girls can eat whatever they want with no <br/>
comment from me? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  You&#39;re supposed to go through the rest of your life where the girls can <br/>
eat whatever they want with no comment from you.  And when that starts to <br/>
happen, they will stop &quot;wanting all the junk.&quot;  They won&#39;t stop wanting ANY  <br/>
sweets or whatever you are now calling &quot;junk.&quot;  Most of the change happens in <br/>
you, not in them.  Don&#39;t define some foods as &quot;junk.&quot;  It says way too much <br/>
you don&#39;t want to say.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a book called _Let Them Eat Cake! The case against controlling what<br/>
your children eat - The pediatrician&#39;s guide to safe and healthy food and<br/>
growth_   I&#39;ve pretty much allowed my kids to eat the way they learn.  My<br/>
son, now 13, eats &quot;beige.&quot;  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever eaten a vegetable.  He&#39;s<br/>
taller than I am now, about 5&#39;4&quot;+, and 122 lbs.  According to the growth<br/>
charts, he&#39;s holding steady at the 95th percentile, pretty much where he&#39;s<br/>
been since birth.  My daughter, currently 15, eats a somewhat more varied<br/>
diet, and, at 5&#39;3&quot; and 108, holds steady near the 25th percentile.<br/>
<br/>
My very cool pediatrician told me, back when Laura was a toddler, that, if<br/>
it made ME feel better, I could slip some spinach into a lasagna once in<br/>
awhile, but a big battle over food would create more problems than not<br/>
eating veggies.  I, of course, hate vegetable lasagna and never make any<br/>
kind but the meaty Stouffers anyway &lt;g&gt;  My dh doesn&#39;t like fruit except<br/>
apples and oranges, I dislike almost all cooked green vegetables and so<br/>
never serve them.  We&#39;re all average weight, no health problems, rarely get<br/>
sick, never take vitamins, eat ice cream nearly every day...  So far, they<br/>
haven&#39;t chosen to learn much in the way of math, either, but we now have 22<br/>
pets &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our family, food just isn&#39;t very important.  We eat what we like, we<br/>
don&#39;t think about food much, and no one really likes to cook.<br/>

<br/>
Yes they&#39;d probably go through a transition period where they test the <br/>
limits - just to figure out where those limits went. Be ready for them <br/>
to eat nothing but cheetos for a few days, maybe. It is okay to gently <br/>
point out that they might not be feeling really well - if they do stuff <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I comment.  I mean - my kids expect me to give them information and if <br/>
they are filling up on tortilla chips and I think they might not <br/>
realize that they have almost no protein and that maybe they need some <br/>
protein, they&#39;ll hear from me. Not in a restrictive shaming way - but <br/>
in a, &quot;Do you want an egg salad sandwich or maybe just a hardboiled egg <br/>
to go with that? You can probably use the protein.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Budget is always a factor. I can&#39;t get the kids everything they want <br/>
all the time. BUT - be sure it really is that. If a kid is asking for a <br/>
bag of chips at the checkstand, something that costs under a dollar, I <br/>
doubt it is really budget that prevents you from buying it. But - just <br/>
like with everything else, you have little kids and you can ask: &quot;Would <br/>
you rather have a peach pie or popsicles?&quot; No reason not to just say <br/>
straight out that you don&#39;t feel like you can afford both. You probably <br/>
also couldn&#39;t afford both artichokes AND asparagus in the same shopping <br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
With little kids like yours, I think you&#39;re going to do  a lot of <br/>
dropping what you&#39;re doing and preparing food, yes. But - you can also <br/>
have stuff chopped up and ready and just say that that is there if they <br/>
can&#39;t wait.  There are so many easy finger foods - not having <br/>
restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a short-order cook every <br/>
minute of the day.<br/>
<br/>
I remember that for a while I used to put all kinds of things in little <br/>
baggies in the morning - those snack size baggies. A few pitted dates, <br/>
some raisins, some peanut butter crackers, cheerios, little cheese <br/>
chunks, etc. All KINDS of things. They were in the refrigerator - even <br/>
the things that didn&#39;t need refrigeration, in a big bowl - and the kids <br/>
could just grab a baggie anytime and there was a little snack. I kept <br/>
baggies of frozen grapes in the freezer during the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Not having restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t actually have a fairly <br/>
large amount of control when the kids are little like yours. It means <br/>
you don&#39;t dole out cookies, though, saying, &quot;Here are you two cookies <br/>
for the day and don&#39;t ask for more because you KNOW you&#39;re only allowed <br/>
two cookies per day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only time things get &quot;doled out&quot; like that around here is when we <br/>
need to make sure some gets saved for somebody who isn&#39;t home but we <br/>
know will really like it. Then we divvy it up.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s girl scout leader doles out snack in a really restrictive <br/>
way. Last week the person bringing snack brought a package of cookies <br/>
and some pretzels. The leader put them out and said the girls could <br/>
have all the pretzels they wanted but only two cookies per girl. That <br/>
only used up about 1/4 of the cookies in the package, but when girls <br/>
went back for more she very sharply said, &quot;Two cookies is enough for <br/>
you.&quot; (She&#39;s very nice - i don&#39;t mean she said it meanly - but very <br/>
strongly.) Her daughter asks for food ALL the time. We were at a girl <br/>
scout event and she wanted stuff from the snack bar - just candy, <br/>
chips, etc. My daughter wasn&#39;t hungry because she&#39;d eaten a tangerine, <br/>
a cheese sandwich, half a cucumber, and some carrots. Yesterday at the <br/>
stables there were cans of soda in the refrigerator and my daughter got <br/>
off her horse and was really hot and thirsty - I offered her the soda <br/>
but she turned it down and said she needed water. The soda and junk <br/>
food don&#39;t hold any special attraction for her at all - she evaluates <br/>
whether she feels like having it based on whether she really FEELS like <br/>
having it. There are no other deeper motives, no extra feelings - she <br/>
doesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different <br/>
than if she feels like having an apple.  I&#39;m amazed and happy.<br/>

chosen nothing but chocolate chip cookies and cups full of chocolate <br/>

they start to hurt, they&#39;re telling you they don&#39;t want anymore chips, <br/>

else.  <br/>

&gt;doesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different <br/>
&gt;than if she feels like having an apple.  I&#39;m amazed and happy.<br/>

<br/>
Tell me what might happen? I&#39;m not really sure how these things would<br/>
play out at somebody else&#39;s house&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve run into this a few times.  In one case, Dagny was visiting at my<br/>
sister&#39;s house.  When she got hungry she asked for some food and was<br/>
told that it was not snack time.  At their house they eat at certain<br/>
times of the day and that&#39;s it.  She came home pretty confused about why<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t just eat if they were hungry.  I think she was about four.<br/>
We talked about what we could do about it, and the next time she went<br/>
for a sleepover I told my sister that it was important to me that Dagny<br/>
eat when she was hungry, and we&#39;d be happy to pack some snacks.  My<br/>
sister decided it was better just not to enforce her rules on my kids.<br/>
She thinks it&#39;s nuts, but she&#39;s never denied Dagny food again. <br/>
<br/>
Often, when we have big family dinners, I get asked what my kids &#39;want&#39;<br/>
(meaning what I want them to have).  You&#39;d think after 10 years of me<br/>
answering, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll have to go ask them&quot;, my family would get<br/>
the message.  No such luck :0).  ~Rue</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586110407">While lots of my relatives think *I* should be in charge of my kids&#39;<br/>
eating, none of them think *they* should!  I feel very strongly that no<br/>
one should control my children, and I protect them from anyone who<br/>
tries.  We often bring a box of mac and cheese or something to family<br/>
dinners so that the kids know there will be something there that they<br/>
like.  In your situation,when dessert time came around I would just say,<br/>
____ will have some dessert too, thanks (assuming she does want some).<br/>
If your mil wants to discuss it tell her you&#39;d like to do that<br/>
privately, and then privately tell her that you are their parents and<br/>
she&#39;ll need to respect your decisions, and that you&#39;d hate for this<br/>
issue to make your family dinners so unenjoyable that no one wants to<br/>
come anymore.  Maybe not so smooth, but effective.  ~Rue<br/>

but they will say I&#39;m hungry and usually the Mom will say how about______.  <br/>
And they will find something the boys like.  Have no family here so it is <br/>
usually another mother.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting to watch the other children when they come here.  If <br/>
the child gets hungry or just wants something to eat they will either ask <br/>
Dallen, 8YO, or me.  When I say help yourself, for the first time, and then <br/>
show them what we have their eyes get wide and they ask if they can have <br/>
anything.  They are so amazed that they don&#39;t have to ask for food here.  <br/>
They know where the frig is and the cabinet where the boys food is (low for <br/>
them to reach).  Of course their Mom freaks out when she sees her son getting <br/>
into my cabinets.  LOL.  A learning experience.  After the first couple of <br/>
times the children just make themselves at home.  I think that is one of the <br/>
reasons they always call me &quot;the cool Mom.&quot;  LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712612402">Heidi, you&#39;re going to have to stand up for your girls, because you&#39;re the<br/>
only one who can do it. Your relatives will get used to the idea that these<br/>
are your children and your decisions, you just need to be firm and calm with<br/>
them. And if they CAN&#39;T get used to that, it is a very good idea for you to<br/>
see a lot less of them.<br/>
<br/>
How to handle it is up to you -- some options are to bring food for the<br/>
girls yourself and offer that as a choice if they don&#39;t like what&#39;s on the<br/>
table, to tell the families ahead of time, &quot;We&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re not<br/>
going to make the girls eat anything they don&#39;t want to, just wanted to warn<br/>
you up front so you&#39;re not surprised the next time we come over&quot;, etc. If<br/>
your parents or in-laws want to make some kind of &quot;no dessert&quot; rule, bring a<br/>
dessert and give it to the girls, or leave when dessert is served with a<br/>
cheerful, &quot;Well, we&#39;re off to Baskin Robbins!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re an adult and these are your children. You&#39;re not being mean or<br/>
disrespectful or rude to act like it. :) It&#39;s your duty to protect them and<br/>
to raise them as you see fit, and if you see fit to be nice to them and try<br/>
to make their lives as pleasant as you can, your relatives are just going to<br/>
have to learn to live with it, or live with not being around your family<br/>
much.<br/>

Ben spends his vacation weeks with the Guard---but the boys wanted to play <br/>
with the cousins, so...<br/>
<br/>
We sent chips and salsa, a pound cake, a turkey, and some other snack foods <br/>
as well as chocolate milk (for Duncan) and cases of cokes (which they said <br/>
to---because they&#39;re so expensive).<br/>
<br/>
The boys were MADE to drink plain milk---neither really care for it except <br/>
occasionally---at every meal. They weren&#39;t allowed to drink but one coke per <br/>
day (The sisters- & brothers-in-law drank them all!) even though we sent four <br/>
cases for our boys (so they could share). <br/>
<br/>
We also sent $100 for them to go out to eat seafood one night---again they <br/>
were made to order milk. And the aunt & uncles & grands wouldn&#39;t allow <br/>
Cameron (who was 13 at the time) to order for himself---he wanted steak, not <br/>
seafood; he got flounder.<br/>
<br/>
They also had strict bedtimes for the kids, so the adults could play games. <br/>
No adult would go down to the beach to be with the children when Wimbeldon <br/>
was on, so the kids had to stay in the house most of the day---even the &quot;big&quot; <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
The boys complained LOUDLY about the whole experience. They won&#39;t go <br/>
back---and I don&#39;t blame them. They never want to be alone with their aunts & <br/>
uncles again.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess it depends on the restrictions and the adults&#39; attitudes towards <br/>
the kids. I don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; Lovejoy outings anymore. I guess my boys don&#39;t either!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Budget is always a factor for everyone to some extent. How do you handle <br/>
other budgets within the family?<br/>
<br/>
My children, who have always eaten what they want when they want, make <br/>
way better food choices than I do. There is a little child inside of me <br/>
who is greedy for love and has it all mixed up with food. I didn&#39;t want <br/>
that for them. So, we have good food around and they eat it when they <br/>
want it and they don&#39;t have issues with it.<br/>
<br/>
What they just had for lunch:<br/>
<br/>
Girl age 11:<br/>
<br/>
1 hard cooked egg cut in half in a cute zig zag pattern that she likes <br/>
and served with a side of spices to dip it in.<br/>
<br/>
Red Bliss Terra potato chips.<br/>
<br/>
Edame<br/>
<br/>
Hard roll with turkey and mayo<br/>
<br/>
Coke<br/>
<br/>
Girl age 8:<br/>
<br/>
prunes<br/>
<br/>
1 slice bacon<br/>
<br/>
1 hard cooked egg sliced in egg slicer (so much fun) served with sea <br/>
salt on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Red Bliss Terra potato chips<br/>
<br/>
apple juice<br/>
<br/>
They wish they could eat more of the Red Bliss chips because they are so <br/>
tasty but they are expensive so they only get a few each and will save <br/>
the rest of the bag for later.<br/>
<br/>
They are at the point in their life where they know quality snacks, <br/>
whether rich in fat and salt and sugar or not. We talk about getting a <br/>
few good things rather than a more of something that isn&#39;t good. They <br/>
know good things come in small packages and cost more. ;)<br/>
<br/>
It is about control -- letting go of it and letting one&#39;s own children <br/>
pick up their own power and run with it. If your children really trust <br/>
that you are not buying something because you really can&#39;t afford it <br/>
they will respect it. They will not have that trust if it is lie. By the <br/>
time they are 11 or 12 I think most kids know just about everything <br/>
about their parents: when they lie, when they tell the truth, when they <br/>
are bending it to make a point, what territory a child shouldn&#39;t venture <br/>
into because mom or dad has an issue with it. They KNOW. And they didn&#39;t <br/>
learn it at age 11 or 12 they learned it at 2 and 3 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
And since you are all probably annoyed with an anti food thread on This <br/>
List, I will post a fairly funny url, too many pop ups but:<br/>

&gt; Pam, thank you for taking your time to help me.  Today my children have<br/>

&gt; chips.  All I said was &quot;just pay attention to how your tummies feel.  If<br/>

&gt; even if they taste good.&quot;  But, jeesh!  It&#39;s so hard to not say anything<br/>
&gt; else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For awhile now I&#39;ve had the breakfast cereals down where they can help<br/>
&gt; themselves.  I&#39;m going to do the little baggies and put them low down in<br/>
&gt; the fridge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do your kids handle going to relative&#39;s houses where food is<br/>
&gt; &quot;managed?&quot;  I think it must be hard on little children to understand the<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Are we supposed to go through a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;transitional period where the girls can eat whatever they want with no<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;comment from me?  What if budget is a factor?  I can&#39;t afford to buy<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;everything they say they have to have at the grocery store and I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;like to put some of the money into good food.  At home, when they want<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;food that needs to be prepared, do you just drop whatever your doing to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;rush into the kitchen to make what they want?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Good questions!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yes they&#39;d probably go through a transition period where they test the<br/>
&gt; &gt;limits - just to figure out where those limits went. Be ready for them<br/>
&gt; &gt;to eat nothing but cheetos for a few days, maybe. It is okay to gently<br/>
&gt; &gt;point out that they might not be feeling really well - if they do stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt;themselves.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I comment.  I mean - my kids expect me to give them information and if<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are filling up on tortilla chips and I think they might not<br/>
&gt; &gt;realize that they have almost no protein and that maybe they need some<br/>
&gt; &gt;protein, they&#39;ll hear from me. Not in a restrictive shaming way - but<br/>
&gt; &gt;in a, &quot;Do you want an egg salad sandwich or maybe just a hardboiled egg<br/>
&gt; &gt;to go with that? You can probably use the protein.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Budget is always a factor. I can&#39;t get the kids everything they want<br/>
&gt; &gt;all the time. BUT - be sure it really is that. If a kid is asking for a<br/>
&gt; &gt;bag of chips at the checkstand, something that costs under a dollar, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;doubt it is really budget that prevents you from buying it. But - just<br/>
&gt; &gt;like with everything else, you have little kids and you can ask: &quot;Would<br/>
&gt; &gt;you rather have a peach pie or popsicles?&quot; No reason not to just say<br/>
&gt; &gt;straight out that you don&#39;t feel like you can afford both. You probably<br/>
&gt; &gt;also couldn&#39;t afford both artichokes AND asparagus in the same shopping<br/>
&gt; &gt;trip.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;With little kids like yours, I think you&#39;re going to do  a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt;dropping what you&#39;re doing and preparing food, yes. But - you can also<br/>
&gt; &gt;have stuff chopped up and ready and just say that that is there if they<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t wait.  There are so many easy finger foods - not having<br/>
&gt; &gt;restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a short-order cook every<br/>
&gt; &gt;minute of the day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I remember that for a while I used to put all kinds of things in little<br/>
&gt; &gt;baggies in the morning - those snack size baggies. A few pitted dates,<br/>
&gt; &gt;some raisins, some peanut butter crackers, cheerios, little cheese<br/>
&gt; &gt;chunks, etc. All KINDS of things. They were in the refrigerator - even<br/>
&gt; &gt;the things that didn&#39;t need refrigeration, in a big bowl - and the kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;could just grab a baggie anytime and there was a little snack. I kept<br/>
&gt; &gt;baggies of frozen grapes in the freezer during the summer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Not having restrictions doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t actually have a fairly<br/>
&gt; &gt;large amount of control when the kids are little like yours. It means<br/>
&gt; &gt;you don&#39;t dole out cookies, though, saying, &quot;Here are you two cookies<br/>
&gt; &gt;for the day and don&#39;t ask for more because you KNOW you&#39;re only allowed<br/>
&gt; &gt;two cookies per day.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;The only time things get &quot;doled out&quot; like that around here is when we<br/>
&gt; &gt;need to make sure some gets saved for somebody who isn&#39;t home but we<br/>
&gt; &gt;know will really like it. Then we divvy it up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My daughter&#39;s girl scout leader doles out snack in a really restrictive<br/>
&gt; &gt;way. Last week the person bringing snack brought a package of cookies<br/>
&gt; &gt;and some pretzels. The leader put them out and said the girls could<br/>
&gt; &gt;have all the pretzels they wanted but only two cookies per girl. That<br/>
&gt; &gt;only used up about 1/4 of the cookies in the package, but when girls<br/>
&gt; &gt;went back for more she very sharply said, &quot;Two cookies is enough for<br/>
&gt; &gt;you.&quot; (She&#39;s very nice - i don&#39;t mean she said it meanly - but very<br/>
&gt; &gt;strongly.) Her daughter asks for food ALL the time. We were at a girl<br/>
&gt; &gt;scout event and she wanted stuff from the snack bar - just candy,<br/>
&gt; &gt;chips, etc. My daughter wasn&#39;t hungry because she&#39;d eaten a tangerine,<br/>
&gt; &gt;a cheese sandwich, half a cucumber, and some carrots. Yesterday at the<br/>
&gt; &gt;stables there were cans of soda in the refrigerator and my daughter got<br/>
&gt; &gt;off her horse and was really hot and thirsty - I offered her the soda<br/>
&gt; &gt;but she turned it down and said she needed water. The soda and junk<br/>
&gt; &gt;food don&#39;t hold any special attraction for her at all - she evaluates<br/>
&gt; &gt;whether she feels like having it based on whether she really FEELS like<br/>
&gt; &gt;having it. There are no other deeper motives, no extra feelings - she<br/>
&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t evaluate whether she feels like having a cookie any different<br/>
&gt; &gt;than if she feels like having an apple.  I&#39;m amazed and happy.<br/>

But I do notice that children who have never been able to order for <br/>

they look like a deer caught in the headlights.  The servers always ask us <br/>

themselves.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m picturing a meal at my parents or in-laws where there&#39;s no dessert<br/>
&gt; if you don&#39;t eat all your dinner.  The girls usually hate what my mil<br/>
&gt; prepares and she very forceful about their eating.  She&#39;ll make them eat<br/>
&gt; the pork tenderloin with peppercorns or no dessert, then serve dessert<br/>
&gt; to the cousins (kids) who did eat it.  The truth will come out when the<br/>
&gt; girls say, &quot;but we get to eat what we want at home.&quot;  I live in a small<br/>
&gt; town with both families living nearby.  We eat together quite a lot.<br/>
&gt;  They&#39;ll know the change in our eating ways pretty quick, way before the<br/>
&gt; girls learn to regulate themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was just wondering if you had any smooth ways to handle this.  I<br/>
&gt; always think up my best responses after-the-fact, but this time I want<br/>
&gt; to be prepared.  Heidi Case<br/>

&gt; &gt;Tell me what might happen? I&#39;m not really sure how these things would<br/>
&gt; &gt;play out at somebody else&#39;s house. My kids just tend to eat what they<br/>
&gt; &gt;are given if they&#39;re not at home, I think. Or - if it is a family<br/>
&gt; &gt;get-together, we usually have stuff out on the table - cookies or<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;Let them see the results first - don&#39;t tell them in advance, before you<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I can see the consternation and confusion, but they let it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;slide.  However, I know that when they find out what I&#39;m attempting<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;with<br/>

&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t tell them. Just live. Act natural. If they say something, look<br/>
&gt; &gt;surprised and say, &quot;Oh, this is a special day because YOU are here!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; How do your kids handle going to relative&#39;s houses where food is <br/>
&quot;managed?&quot;  I think it must be hard on little children to understand the <br/>
mixed signals between home and, say, grandma&#39;s house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were really little, we were in a babysitting co-op, and they <br/>
figured out very early that the rules are different at different houses.  <br/>
<br/>
There are no mixed signals at their grandma&#39;s house.  She expects them to eat <br/>
whatever beef-tongue crap she gives them and then have dessert.  She honestly <br/>
has served beef tongue.  And once the dessert was a very small portion of <br/>
cooked raisins with something, kind of a raisin-cobbler looking thing.   <br/>
Marty was four or so, and was interested in that raisin stuff, but didn&#39;t <br/>
want to finish whatever else she had served (not beef tI shoved mine over <br/>
toward Marty and said, &quot;Here, you can have mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I broke her rules, but screw her; I was nearly 40 years old, too.  <br/>
<br/>
By a technicality, I had earned the raisin and breading stuff because I ate <br/>
my plate.<br/>
<br/>
I realize HER technicality was that I had earned the privilege of eating her <br/>
little raisin cup.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, if we stay there more than a day, we do what Keith and his <br/>
brothers always did.  On some pretense we leave the house, and we go where <br/>
food is for sale and we EAT.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom seems  never to have figured out that she trained her kids to <br/>
gorge and horde and sneak food.  From HER point of view, she &quot;kept them <br/>
healthy&quot; by not giving them too much, and the bad effects of anything they <br/>
ate away from her table are not HER fault, that&#39;s what they deserve for being <br/>
sneaky and hungry, since there was &quot;no reason&quot; for them to eat more than she <br/>
gave them.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people think that way.<br/>
