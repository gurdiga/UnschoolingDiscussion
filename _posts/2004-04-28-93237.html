<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875309718">hi there<br/>
<br/>
i would just keep talking and not worry to much.  my<br/>
boys (2,4,8,17,20 years old) have all done things that<br/>
are shocking at one point or another.  I think<br/>
sometimes we are worried about things that are just<br/>
kids exploring different things.  talk to her about<br/>
death maybe she is interested.  Death is such a taboo<br/>
in our culture and people are so afraid of death and<br/>
all that means to people and are so reluctant to talk<br/>
about it maybe your daughter is picking up on the fact<br/>
that others are uncomfortable and so is more curious<br/>
about it. <br/>
<br/>
good luck<br/>
love and peace<br/>

<br/>
Talk to her about the &quot;why&#39;s&quot; of her play without directing it.  The baby in<br/>
the bottle scenario could lead to questions about what happened to the baby,<br/>
how did the mommy feel, will the baby be ok later, etc..<br/>
<br/>
My kids are very interested in death.  One of their favorite places is the<br/>
old cemetary.  We go get slushies and stop in, walk around, talk about the<br/>
tombstones and the possible lives of the people who have passed.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of animals and so deaths of loved ones occur her with a bit of<br/>
regularity.  The kids thoroughly examine the dead bodies, help bury them,<br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
Death is a very natural thing and to be interested in it, to me, is no more<br/>
curious than being interested in childbirth.<br/>

  How should I handle this?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As a mother who has dealt with the death of my children&#39;s father, I think I <br/>
can offer some great insight here... Death should be dealt with just as any <br/>
other part of life is dealt with, it happens to everyone! &lt;bg&gt;  Allow your <br/>
children to talk about their own ideas about death without judgment and <br/>
answer their questions HONESTLY.  My kids were 2 & 4 when Mitch died, but <br/>
they had been dealing with cancer for almost three years before that.  We <br/>
found out the hard way that honesty IS the best policy; keeping secrets only <br/>
terrified my children and the truth (even admitting we didn&#39;t know <br/>
EVERYTHING) comforted them.  Explain the difference between gone (temporary) <br/>
and GONE (death/permanent).  Nothing should be off limits between parents & <br/>
children!<br/>
Let me know if there is anything specific I can help you with! :)<br/>

brought up cars again, because he seems to have no concept of how dangerous <br/>

he&#39;s crossing the parking lot and doesn&#39;t pay much attention at all to cars or <br/>

<br/>
Can you ferret out what is the source of all this concern?  Why is he so <br/>
concerned about dying?  Did he see something that started him thinking <br/>
about this? scared him?  Time to start asking him what&#39;s bothering him most <br/>
about all this.  I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t just come out of the blue.  My son&#39;s <br/>
death kick started the first time he saw a tombstone in a cemetery at the <br/>
age of 4.  Many convoluted questions later it turned out he was scared he <br/>
would be left alone, thought if we went to sleep, we might die; could I get <br/>
so angry (as I was want to do in those days) that I could get a heart <br/>
attack and die?; etc....but of course, those were not the questions he <br/>
asked directly.  I had to sit down and do some detective work with him, on <br/>
his bed, sitting next to him quietly asking him what was really bothering <br/>
him.  (Mind you both my kids kept up this death thing for years--they&#39;re <br/>
now 15 and 11 and it&#39;s over!)<br/>

WHAT A GREAT IDEA~~<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tie in Egyptian tombs and mummies (they didn&#39;t do that for just anybody <br/>
though, so maybe not), Hindus and cremation and the Ganghes (I think I&#39;d <br/>
leave out the wifely self-immolation, depending on the kid), and other exotic (to <br/>
us) treatments of the remains of the deceased, and what the beliefs are about <br/>
their souls.<br/>
<br/>
For a child really obsessed with death (an older child) a visit to a mortuary <br/>
might be interesting.   If they&#39;re too busy and uninterested in sharing <br/>
details with a child, you could at least look at the display room of coffins, and <br/>
maybe just casually view someone else&#39;s relative a moment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=============================================<br/>
<br/>
Emily went through an obsession with death about 3 years ago that lasted for<br/>
about 2 years. I think part of what spurred it on was my mother, who was<br/>
living with us at the time, lost several older relatives and went back East<br/>
for several funerals.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, a really great book for kids is _What Happens When Dinosaurs<br/>
Die?_  It removes death by talking about it in terms of dinosaurs, but<br/>
addresses all the different ways people die and all the questions kids might<br/>
have in a book/ cartoon strip format. *Beware:* it does talk about the rare<br/>
instances when parents die either from a violent death like a car crash or<br/>
disease. While this can be a frightening concept, I&#39;m guessing that kids<br/>
have already put two and two together and *are* worried about losing someone<br/>
they love even if they haven&#39;t formulated the thought very clearly yet.<br/>
<br/>
We used Em&#39;s fascination to talk about different religions and different<br/>
customs. I talked about traveling to Asia--one of the most fascinating<br/>
cultural differences were the way they buried and treated ancestors. We read<br/>
William Wordsworth&#39;s poem &quot;We are Seven&quot;, written from a little girls<br/>
perspective back in the late 1700&#39;s about losing siblings. It&#39;s a really<br/>
happy, upbeat, matter-of-fact perspective--she plays with them when she<br/>
visits their graves--which the narrator just cannot grasp.  It&#39;s a neat way<br/>
to explore death from a child&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I think that death is just a normal fascination for children. It&#39;s a really<br/>
tough concept to wrap their minds around. Em was so excited when my<br/>
grandfather died because she was going to attend his funeral. It was such an<br/>
important event, and I&#39;m so glad my children were part of it. All 3 of mine<br/>
(6, 4 and 3 at the time) attended the funeral and grave-side services, and I<br/>
think they really got a lot out of all of it, particularly the honor guard<br/>
service at the grave. I was sooo mad when dh&#39;s grandmother died and his<br/>
mother didn&#39;t want the children to attend the services. I bit my tongue, and<br/>
we stayed home instead of travelling the 4.5 hours to New Jersey. I figured<br/>
if they weren&#39;t welcome, there was no way in hell I was going to make them<br/>
endure the drive! Argh! I just feel it&#39;s so important to treat children with<br/>
respect and equality, to be honest with them. (Diana&#39;s post about being<br/>
honest with children dealing with death rung so true! My dad died a long<br/>
drawn-out, cancer-like illness when I was 12, and I have never forgiven my<br/>
mother for keeping me in the dark and shipping me off the night he died.<br/>
That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother post, but it explains where I&#39;m coming from with my<br/>
own children.) Even young children gain so much by being a part of family<br/>
rituals, including funerals. They learn about death, grief, family history,<br/>
ritual, tradition--you name it. Most of all, they learn that they are an<br/>
important part of their own family.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, jumping off my soapbox, now. *sheepish grin*<br/>
