<div id="ygrps-yiv-773337822">Oh I have some fond memories playing that game with my grandmother.<br/>
I wish I could remeber how to play that game so I could share it with <br/>
my son.<br/>
Thanks for the reminder.<br/>
That is my favorite thing to do with son play games<br/>
I could play all day<br/>
Oh on that note:<br/>
We were playing parchessi today and he use to count all he die every <br/>
single time.  Now he&#39;s throwing out numbers and he is mostly right <br/>
but he tells me he guessing.  I figure he is trying to add them in <br/>
his head or practicing to.  He did mention that he was doing <br/>
something in his head though ??  anyway I think dice are good number <br/>
pratice for kids :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My friends and kids laugh when I empty my pockets because I&#39;m always <br/>
carrying dice around with me.<br/>
<br/>
Games with 2 or more dice are a wonderful way for kids to be able to <br/>
develop ease with simple addition - no need for memorizing.<br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of very cool dice around - I love them and collect <br/>
them and sometimes make up games to play with them.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun thing to do is change the rules a little so you can play <br/>
with some of the more unusual dice. For example - get a couple of 12 or <br/>
20 sided dice and play parcheesi - the game will play differently - <br/>
much faster and strategies have to be adjusted. Or, iinstead of adding <br/>
the dice, subtract the smaller from the larger.  Or - throw one and <br/>
then another and subtract the second throw from the first -- if the <br/>
second is a bigger number then you still find the difference, but move <br/>
backwards. (If you throw a 5 and then a 3, you have 5-3= 2 so you move <br/>
forward 2 spaces, but if you throw first a 3 and then a 5, you have <br/>
3-5= -2 so you move backwards 2 spaces.)<br/>
<br/>
No reason you can&#39;t play the same games but multiply the numbers, <br/>
instead of adding them, either. Talk about a faster-moving game!!!<br/>
<br/>
There are blank dice that you can write on with a permanent marker so <br/>
you can put whatever numbers you want on there. Try putting 1/4, 1/3, <br/>
1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and 1 on one die and 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 on <br/>
another one and multiply the two dice. (You might have to make up some <br/>
different rules for this one depending on what game you&#39;re playing - so <br/>
that it is possible to move up to 72 spaces in one turn &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
You can get blank dice at teacher supply stores or put &quot;order blank <br/>
dice&quot; into google and find places to buy online.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a local game store - one where they play Magic, the Gathering and <br/>
Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that and look at all the cool kinds <br/>
of dice!!<br/>
<br/>
By the way - one of the simplest dice games is this one - you really <br/>
only need one die for this. First person rolls. They can choose to <br/>
&quot;stay&quot; or roll again. If they roll again, they add what they got the <br/>
first time to the new roll. Again, they can choose to stay or roll <br/>
again. If they choose to roll again, they add the third number to their <br/>
total.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is player two&#39;s turn. Player two must roll as many times as <br/>
player one did.<br/>
<br/>
Both players are trying to get as close to 12 as possible without <br/>
reaching 12 or more. If player one goes over, player two automatically <br/>
wins a point for that turn. If player one doesn&#39;t go over, and player <br/>
two doesn&#39;t go over in the same number of rolls, then whoever is closer <br/>
to 12 wins the point. If player one doesn&#39;t go over, but player two <br/>
does, then player one wins the point. Continue to play, alternating <br/>
going first.<br/>
<br/>
You can either just say the game is over when one of the players <br/>
reaches five points and wins, or you can make it more exciting and have <br/>
it that once either player has gotten to five points, you win by being <br/>
ahead of the other player by at least 2 points.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915197953">Well - you are giving me the chance to make some of my favorite <br/>
games/math comments here.<br/>
<br/>
You all do realize, of course, that mathematicians don&#39;t sit around <br/>
doing the kind of math that you learned in school. They don&#39;t sit <br/>
around and do long division or divide fractions or even solve quadratic <br/>
equations &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
What they do is &quot;play around.&quot; In fact, they play games. Some games are <br/>
number games, some are spatial puzzles, some are strategy games and <br/>
others are logic games.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t just play the same old games, though. Mostly, they take a <br/>
&quot;game&quot; that has been played and won by somebody and they change the <br/>
rules a little and then they watch it play out and look at how the play <br/>
of the game changes and how the outcomes change.<br/>
<br/>
Only the very most brilliant mathematician ever makes up a whole new <br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
So - when you play games, you are doing exactly what mathematicians <br/>
really do IF you fool with the games a bit, experiment, see how the <br/>
play change if you change a rule here and there.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways to change game rules - sometimes a simple <br/>
seemingly innocuous change can have major impacts on how the game plays <br/>
out and what the outcome is.  What if you let people have the option of <br/>
skipping a turn, for example? Or - what if at the end of a turn they <br/>
roll a die and call out a number - if they get a match with the number <br/>
on the die, they get an extra turn.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and when you make up games and they flop - be sure to examine why <br/>
they flop - that is a big huge part of what mathematicians do, too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Marty has been designing an online role playing game for a year or so.  He <br/>
came to talk to me about it last night.  He&#39;s rejected two plans, and got a <br/>
phone call from a friend asking him to hurry, because he wanted to play it.<br/>
<br/>
He said he wants it to be &quot;money based,&quot; but he doens&#39;t want people to cheat, <br/>
and the main problem with money-based games (points, but they&#39;re calling them <br/>
dollars) is people just cheat to get money.  <br/>
<br/>
In a wild-west based game the ways to get money (that he discussed) are <br/>
rents, fines, bounties, bank robbery, mining and selling properties.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are &quot;battles,&quot; in this case gun battles.  He wants to make them <br/>
fairly quick, like no more than three rolls each.  He tried working with a <br/>
least-points-was-best chart, but the problem there is it&#39;s not balanced.  If you <br/>
roll three dice (in this case, online dice, which are little random-number <br/>
generator routines with dice pictures or just number series like 1-4-5) you don&#39;t <br/>
get all the numbers between 1 and 18.  You only get 3 to 18, because you can&#39;t <br/>
roll a one.<br/>
<br/>
It was really interesting to hear him pouring out all his mathematical and <br/>
logistical situations.  It seemed to be so complex as to not be worth doing, but <br/>
then I look at his dad who voluntarily became an engineer and who works with <br/>
systems integration and sometimes long, LONG piles of sheets of computer code, <br/>
looking pretty merrily for why one subroutine occasionally doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
EEEEEP!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I couldn&#39;t get my webpage text to turn back to another color and I <br/>
was about to give up, and that was mostly in English!  (the part I was working <br/>
with, anyway &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
So for those who think mathematically, for whom this sort of things is NOT <br/>
overwhelming (and it includes all three of my children, which is wonderful) it <br/>
really is just another way of playing, of enjoying ideas and possibilities.<br/>
