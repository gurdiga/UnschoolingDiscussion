Have you seen the one about PMDD Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Dysfunction?  <br/>
You&#39;re supposed to take a drug now for PMS?<br/>
<br/>
There is one about the purple pill.  It never tells you what the drug is <br/>
for, you&#39;re just supposed to ask your doc.  These commercials are getting a <br/>
quick-fix society to run to their dr to get a drug for every simple little <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
My mom complained to her doctor that she hasn&#39;t had any energy lately- so he <br/>
gave her effexor (an anti-depressant).  She started taking it, and now every <br/>
time she tries to stop (because she doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s helping her, and <br/>
she doesn&#39;t really need it) she has horrible withdrawal symptoms.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60399742">I have to say that although I feel Ritalin isn&#39;t a<br/>
neccessary drug for MY &quot;hyperactive&quot; children, I have<br/>
seen some benefit from it. I also know that although<br/>
antidepressants are being handed out like candy, they<br/>
do have value to those that truly need them, myself<br/>
included. <br/>
When the school diagnosed my son with ADHD, I<br/>
consulted my Dr., who laughed, then sent the school a<br/>
nice long letter with loads of medical term. to shut<br/>
them up. Can he sit at a desk for 6 hours? no. Can he<br/>
concentrate on something he enjoys for a long period<br/>
of time? yes. Hyper? no. Normal? yes.<br/>
 I did opt for a quick fix, took him out of that<br/>
dreadful school and hes never going back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543568949">On drugs such as Prozac, the list of withdrawl associated disorders is<br/>
sometimes longer than the precautions.  Which of course the docs aren&#39;t<br/>
going to tell you about.<br/>
