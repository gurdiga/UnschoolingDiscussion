LOL Brenda!  Hey, we&#39;d get on smashingly then! &lt;bwg&gt;  Oh, I can&#39;t wait to go <br/>
to the conference!!  I wish I could drag my enormous family (extended) with <br/>
me.  I can only imagine them lost in a sea of odd, quirky unschoolers!  Doh! <br/>
  Did I just call you all odd and quirky?? &lt;beg&gt;  I guess that was my family <br/>
speaking through me!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, thanking you all for making me *feel* normal!<br/>
