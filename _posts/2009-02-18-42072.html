<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143953532">Hi All,  I am new to this group so would like to introduce myself and <br/>
explain why I am here. Sorry this is going to take many words but WE <br/>
need Help!<br/>
My name is Kara, I&#39;m married for 17 years and we have 3 children. We <br/>
live in Memphis which has a very troubled school system.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
lucky to have our children at the University school for Elementary <br/>
school.  Our Daughter  is now in 10th grade in an optional program.  <br/>
Optional programs are small sub- programs within the public schools.  <br/>
To get into an optional program you must qualify, usally with an A- B <br/>
average and scores in the 80th percentile in reading and Math on the <br/>
National tests. My daughter qualified and she &quot;fits&quot; the system, as <br/>
in: school is important to her, getting good grades.....and so forth. <br/>
My youngest is still in Elementary and although he qualifies for the <br/>
optional program in our district there are only 20 available openings <br/>
now for middle school and probably a couple hundred trying to get in. <br/>
If one is to attend public school in Memphis, one prefers the <br/>
optional, it is safer, more organized, and the kids in the program <br/>
enjoy school and are committed, and the program offers a wide variety <br/>
of learning opportunities.<br/>
My Middle son is the reason why I write.  He missed the qualification <br/>
for the optional program by only a few points, and there are no <br/>
exceptions.  We placed him in a catholic school because it was a <br/>
private school we could afford and he knew several children <br/>
attending, the regular public program was not an option for us at the <br/>
time because of the dangerous setting (weapons and violence in the <br/>
schools other discipline problems). We hoped it would be an easy <br/>
transition.  <br/>
It has been anything but easy.  My child went from a well liked by <br/>
the teachers, never in trouble&quot;  A, B student to a student who is <br/>
constantly getting in trouble for ridiculous things, and <br/>
flunking....Now the school wants us to test him for ADHD.... I feel <br/>
like the school should be tested for abuse and neglect.... but <br/>
getting back on point.. I&#39;ve seen enough documentaries now on the <br/>
push to test and drug children that it scares the H--- out of me.  <br/>
And I don&#39;t believe this is the case with my child anyway.  Why would <br/>
this show up suddenly when he turns 13.  I think that the experience <br/>
of going to a highly structured, program where everything is learned <br/>
through strict memorization, there is little time for physical <br/>
activity, and socializing and punishment for things like dropping <br/>
your pencil on the ground has caused him to lose all motivation for <br/>
school.  My Husband and I are very relaxed in our parenting, we <br/>
rarely punish, All I have ever cared about is my children&#39;s honesty.<br/>
Our son, I will admit, is a dreamer, an artist like myself. When we <br/>
like something we are a genius in the field, when we don&#39;t have an <br/>
interest we have no desire to pursue it or try.  I was not interested <br/>
in school as a child, but I had many interests, and I did  very well <br/>
in the things I liked, Just like my son.<br/>
Since this awful school experience, we see our son responding with <br/>
anger, frustration, lack of motivation, and withdrawal, all things <br/>
that break my heart.  All I want is for my children to be Happy, to <br/>
feel joy in their heart and this school year for him has been only <br/>
one struggle after another.<br/>
I&#39;ve started investigating other possibilities, and I came across <br/>
Unschooling.  My son has been asking for a couple of months now to be <br/>
homeschooled,  but I have been afraid that I can&#39;t help him like he <br/>
will need in academics, or he will not have the motivation necessary <br/>
to stick with it.  My husband being a College professor with a DR in <br/>
Neuro- Biology feels very strong about College education for his <br/>
kids.. I am not as opinionated.<br/>
Seeing the change in him with lack of motivation, and now frustration <br/>
and anger,  I am also afraid to give him the responsibility that <br/>
unschooling requires.  Then there are the laws about truancy....<br/>
He has already stated that when he turns 16 he is dropping out.<br/>
I do not have the unschooled mindset yet, but I do have a bone to <br/>
pick with public education and our American education system in <br/>
general.  It is Authoritarian, it is turning our kids into mind <br/>
controlled robots, who are told what to do and how to think, who are <br/>
fed information that serves little, useless facts that are forgotten <br/>
soon after the test....<br/>
So, I&#39;m looking for ideas, facts, similar experiences and actions <br/>
taken.  And resources on how Unschooling works.  I know there are a <br/>
lot of homeschoolers here in Memphis, but I am not interested in a <br/>
Religious affiliation. Homeschooling in Memphis is all associated <br/>
with Christianity.  My philosophy is more in line with Zen Buddhism <br/>
although I am not part of any religious organization.<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
I look forward to all responses!<br/>

If you happen to be still sitting here and reading, there&#39;s an online  <br/>
chat soon with a mom whose husband is a professor at a medical school  <br/>
in England.  That might be a way for you to jump over to something  <br/>
that will give you confidence.<br/>

There&#39;s much more you could benefit from reading, but if you start  <br/>
there, you&#39;ll bypass the concern that we&#39;re some other non-academic  <br/>

continue to look into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And private schools cost money.  The money you spend on that, you  <br/>
could go travelling with your son--not all of Asia, but overnight  <br/>
trips to other states to see or do cool things.  He probably needs  <br/>
time to talk and unwind and find joy in learning.<br/>

<br/>
Check out Alfie Kohn, Punished By Rewards, for a good look at what<br/>
rewards and punishments really do for intrinsic motivation, which is<br/>
what we all want our children to find, right?  So if you are seeing<br/>
the opposite of what you want for your son, you need to do the<br/>
opposite of what the schools are doing to help him find it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am also afraid to give him the responsibility that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling requires.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But in order for children to grow into responsible adults, they must<br/>
have responsibility and the opportunity to make meaningful choices for<br/>
themselves.  Yet that isn&#39;t how we treat children in the society in<br/>
general and in school in particular--quite the opposite!<br/>
<br/>
You will see lots of testimonials, as you read things on Sandra&#39;s and<br/>
others&#39; sites about unschooling, regarding the importance of helping<br/>
young people connect with their own passions--and this is the source<br/>
of motivation for people--connection to passion and purpose.  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, a person cannot connect with their own sense of<br/>
responsibility if they have no sense of empowerment in their lives.<br/>

The way we unschooled at our house, our children didn&#39;t have  <br/>
&quot;responsibility.&quot;  Responsibility for what?   I took responsibility.   <br/>
I made sure their lives were busy and stimulating, safe and warm.    <br/>
They learned lots more often and better than they would have in  <br/>
school, and as the years went by they learned more and more, while  <br/>
kids in school determined never to learn anything they didn&#39;t &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot; learn ever again as long as they lived.  Even those who go to  <br/>
college tend to do just as little as they &quot;have to&quot; to make the grades  <br/>
necessary to keep a scholarship or to keep parents from pulling the  <br/>
plug.<br/>

<br/>
Giving our children freedom to choose doesn&#39;t mean to start by giving<br/>
them the keys to the city.  It doesn&#39;t have to be that big of a<br/>
freedom to begin with.  Start slow and let children figure out how to<br/>
use freedom a little at a time ... and develop wisdom over a period of<br/>
years.  In the meantime, the parents want to shoulder the<br/>
responsibility of facilitating success as children make decisions.<br/>
Definitely don&#39;t make them fly on their own all alone in the process.<br/>
And by the time children are ready for greater freedom they&#39;ll be able<br/>
to handle it without going totally bonkers or being too scared to<br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
I *wish* my parents had done that.  Really.  Since they didn&#39;t allow<br/>
me much freedom in their home, by the time I left I hadn&#39;t hardly a<br/>
clue.  I made mistakes which was fine but what *wasn&#39;t* so fine that<br/>
the consequences were HUGE by the time I started making decisions<br/>
independently.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to watch other&#39;s example and follow instructions or<br/>
someone else&#39;s wisdom.  Children need personal experience if they&#39;re<br/>
going to be any good at making decisions, preferably in an environment<br/>
that adults make safe ...... not children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504100390">Hmmm...  I&#39;ll have to think more about that.  When I read what you said, I totally agree <br/>
with you, and I see how words can have different intentions behind them, and how this is <br/>
partly why there is so much confusion out there about what unschooling is.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not advocating anything like what you&#39;ve pointed out.  But i do know that my <br/>
children, and particularly my daughter, have a pretty strong need for choice and getting to <br/>
things in her own time.  So that&#39;s the kind of autonomy I&#39;m talking about--but there very <br/>
well may be a better word or way of thinking about it that doesn&#39;t create such a mental <br/>
division between parent and child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll take one more stab at it--there is a place within my daughter that when she feels it <br/>
&quot;invaded&quot; she gets very defensive and she pulls away, but when she&#39;s given space, she <br/>
opens up and &quot;softens.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if this will make sense, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking of as autonomy...<br/>

By that they seem to mean that if the kids are more obedient then <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068550060">-Interesting,  Coming from a spiritual place of WE ARE ALL ONE,<br/>
<br/>
THE ALL IS IN THE ALL,      It is very interesting to contemplate this<br/>
idea of Autonomy...<br/>
<br/>
This is what life is about at one level, Discovering the self, and <br/>
creating the self, and then creating a life around this self.... So <br/>
much of who we are is based on what others believe about us, what <br/>
others tell us they think about us, what Society and families and <br/>
friends want us to be.<br/>
<br/>
And as we discover the self, we forget our connectedness to each <br/>
other, we forget that there is really no separation...WE do feel <br/>
separate, we do feel like a lone entity....<br/>
<br/>
Is this why we feel sometimes it is Us against them?  Why we put up <br/>
boarders, Why we lock gates....<br/>

Yes.  Conventional parenting proposes to get at freedom for kids (or<br/>
at least independence, which like Sandra mentioned is not the point)<br/>
by first compelling them to listen to advice about how to be<br/>
responsible (and responsibility, as a goal linked to independence,<br/>
also misses the point).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a foreign language.  Few can learn just by following<br/>
someone&#39;s verbal directions.  Most people learn by being immersed in<br/>
the culture and experiencing it.  And it helps very much if the point<br/>
is *not* about making people independent or responsible for<br/>
information they&#39;re not understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a silly dichotomy that following directions is in some people&#39;s<br/>
eyes obedient or good while those who learn by gaining experience<br/>
(getting their hands dirty, so to speak) risk getting tagged as<br/>
rebellious or bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283468293">-=-I&#39;m certainly not advocating anything like what you&#39;ve pointed out.  <br/>
But i do know that my<br/>
children, and particularly my daughter, have a pretty strong need for  <br/>
choice and getting to<br/>
things in her own time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/choices">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the core of all this unschooling business, but it&#39;s not a  <br/>
granulation of members of the family into unconnected entities.<br/>
<br/>
As to my experience, in helping people understand unschooling, the  <br/>
thing that&#39;s not good to take one&#39;s time about getting is that others  <br/>
need to have choices and the freedom to take things in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/doit">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>
<br/>
When unschooling starts, then choices and getting to things in  <br/>
people&#39;s own way and time is the basis.<br/>
<br/>
You perceive your daughter as having a strong need for choice.   What  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have is a right to choices.  If she&#39;s a minor, the parents  <br/>
are legally and morally responsible for the choices she makes.  So as  <br/>
an unschooling parent I can choose to give my kids TONS of choices,  <br/>
but not any choice in the world.  I can create a space in which lots  <br/>
of acceptable, safe and legal choices are available.  I can maintain  <br/>
(and have) an environment in which they can sleep until noon or later  <br/>
and stay up as late as they want (quietly, in the house; responsibly,  <br/>
out of the house, when they&#39;re older).<br/>
<br/>
What I cannot do is turn to the county or the police or my neighbors  <br/>
and assert that my children have the right to any of that.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t.  I have the right to more leeway as an adult, and I have chosen  <br/>
to use that to create a larger learning space for my children than  <br/>
most children have.   But it&#39;s mine.  I&#39;m responsible, and my husband.<br/>
<br/>
When the police called and said &quot;Do you know where your son is?&quot; I  <br/>
said he was at the gaming store or at his friend Josh&#39;s house, or some  <br/>
such.  The guy paused and said &quot;what&#39;s his name?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kirby.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re asking about Martin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He had been pulled over for running a light.   So I said yes, he was  <br/>
with his friend Brett Henry, and yes that was our car, and yes it was  <br/>
fine that he was out.<br/>
<br/>
I think the cop had wished I had said no, because he was in the  <br/>
process of intimidating and scaring them, but it really was okay that  <br/>
he was out, and he was with Brett, as I&#39;d said.<br/>
<br/>
What if I&#39;d said &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers, and so Marty is autonomous and  <br/>
can do whatever he wants to&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355650994">My DDs are 14-year-old twins that have been unschooling for almost 4 years - they have 2 other friends about their same age that have just started unschooling - they hang out together a lot.  Mostly they stay up all night watching movies and shows on DVD.  They are also in the same drama group, so they do that.  <br/>
<br/>
They all say they are interested in getting jobs soon. <br/>
<br/>
 One of my girls takes voice lessons and dance lessons (totally her choice) - they both spend lots and lots of time on the computer doing role-playing games where they write up characters and scenarios and share them with others who play the same game and keep the stories going...<br/>
<br/>
because my DH recently died, I am able to stay home all the time - I was working part-time up until recently.  <br/>
<br/>
I let them eat what they want.  They are still in discovery mode about that so there is junk food involved but also &quot;real&quot; food - surprising what they come up with to eat when I tell them to get what they want at the grocery store (I figure that&#39;s cheaper than them buying stuff at the minute market) - <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am a little confused by the discussion on responsibility and the references to some unschooling parents being irresponsible - I found that a little scary, because I&#39;m not sure what an irresponsible unschooling parent would look like - I know htere are plenty of people around me who think I am being irresponsible, but I am here for my girls, we talk about lots of stuff, we go on trips, we go to movies and plays - we all read a fair amount.  I guess I am asking if what we do seems &quot;irresponsible&quot; in terms of the discussion that has been going on here...<br/>

<br/>
-=-Is this why we feel sometimes it is Us against them? Why we put up<br/>
borders, Why we lock gates....-=-<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally our culture seems antagonistic.  Much more antagonistic  <br/>
than some other cultures.  I spoke with a man from Mexico who was  <br/>
staying in a hotel in Minnesota where Holly and I were, and the  <br/>
Traaseths, last year or so and he and I were at the public computers  <br/>
early in the morning.  He was e-mailing home, and was 24 or so.  He  <br/>
was talking to me about it seeming cold that Americans push their  <br/>
children out of the house and rush them to be on their own.  His  <br/>
family was helping him financially and emotionally and physically, and  <br/>
his girlfriend was living with his parents while he was working with a  <br/>
crew on various projects here and there to make money.  He said  <br/>
there&#39;s more of a feeling of shared resources in Mexican families and  <br/>
he didn&#39;t understand Americans.<br/>
<br/>
I understand Americans, but the &quot;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;You know how to do that yourself&quot; is an adult version of &quot;You can  <br/>
walk; I&#39;m not going to carry you&quot; and &quot;You know how to make a  <br/>
sandwich.&quot;   Too many American kids are set out on their own when  <br/>
they&#39;re five, to get to school and back without a parent.  (I hope  <br/>
other countries have a more parent-friendly school tradition.)   It&#39;s  <br/>
not warm.  It&#39;s not healthy.  There are costs and effects that harm us  <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Being a child&#39;s partner is the opposite of us against them.  It&#39;s &quot;we  <br/>
are a team.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very glad for the things I learned in La Leche League, and I&#39;m  <br/>
glad my family&#39;s circumstances and my interests and the presence of  <br/>
the internet have come together in such a way that I can share that  <br/>
one important thing with people who might not ever have nursed a baby,  <br/>
or might have had no contact with early-childhood attachment  <br/>
theories.   What I learned from La Leche League (and specifically from  <br/>
the words and attitudes of Carol Rice-McClure and Lori Odhner, and  <br/>
Kathy Hoag (now Kathy Isaacson)  was that for Kirby to be happy, he  <br/>
needed a mom who was gentle and attentive and was listening to him,  <br/>
even before he could talk.  For me to be happy, I needed to be the  <br/>
kind of mom Kirby needed right then, in each moment.  And when the two  <br/>
of us were happy together, the relationship would carry through for  <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
The years they were talking were probably three or four or five.<br/>
The years it has carried through are, so far, 22.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t make a decision never to send my children to school.  Keith  <br/>
and I decided not to send Kirby to kindergarten the year he was five.   <br/>
He has a late summer birthday, and we had the legal right to  <br/>
homeschool or to just wait a year.  We registered to homeschool,  <br/>
figuring that when he was six we could either put him in kindergarten,  <br/>
or first, or keep homeschooling.   Each year we asked him.  We thought  <br/>
Marty would probably want to go to school, even if Kirby wasn&#39;t.  We  <br/>
had the right to make those options available to them not because we  <br/>
decided we were radical unschoolers (all we were doing at first was  <br/>
letting one child be home instead of sending him to school), but  <br/>
because the state laws allowed for it, and we took an option.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was old enough, he wanted to stay home too.<br/>
When Holly was old enough, she wanted to stay home too.<br/>
<br/>
We gave them choices within what was safe and legal, and then we made  <br/>
the best of the situation by really unschooling as well as we could.<br/>

It&#39;s exactly what I knew autonomy meant, which is why I was surprised  <br/>
when people were coming to the list saying &quot;But I thought unschooling  <br/>

When I use &quot;strew,&quot; I&#39;m using it as it really is, to scatter things  <br/>

When I ask people to replace phrases involving &quot;teaching&quot; with other  <br/>
phrases centered on &quot;learn&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; I&#39;m not at all, in any way,  <br/>
asking them to use words in any way other than the way the dictionary  <br/>
defines them.  I&#39;m telling them that if they want to learn about  <br/>
natural learning, any time they talk about teaching their child, or  <br/>
the child teaching himself, they aren&#39;t seeing learning.   So when  <br/>
they can catch their words and thoughts about &quot;teaching&quot; they can see  <br/>

&quot;Govern&quot; is not the same as control or guide or influence.  All of  <br/>
those words have specific meanings, and can&#39;t be lumped together as  <br/>
the opposite of autonomy (if that&#39;s what the writer intended).<br/>

Society is moving quite away from control in some ways, and toward it  <br/>

<br/>
No one within a society can be outside of the society, really, can  <br/>
they?  From 2009 in Albuquerque, in Bernalillo County in the State of  <br/>
New Mexico in the United States of America, can I be an autonomous  <br/>
being?  I&#39;m grown.  I&#39;m even a landowner, nearly (a mortgage payer  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  Not male, but that doesn&#39;t matter much these days.<br/>
<br/>
If I were in a teensy village in Europe a thousand years ago, could I  <br/>
have been autonomous and outside the society?<br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;highly influenced&quot; mean in these situations?<br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;governed by those outside of ourselves&quot; mean?   Can you  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751387244">In my experience, &quot;autonomy&quot; as a term within unschooling discussions <br/>
often comes from non-coercive parenting (NCP) or taking children <br/>
seriously (TCS) circles, and it&#39;s used in terms of the first definition <br/>
in the dictionary: self-governance.<br/>
<br/>
I know Sandra and others, myself included, have expressed concerns/ <br/>
problems with NCP/TCS philosophies, but I have found some of the tools I <br/>
gleaned while reading around those philosophies to be very useful <br/>
additions to my own personal parenting philosophy. Autonomy inasmuch as <br/>
is possible for a child would be one of those useful tools--in other <br/>
words, setting up my child&#39;s world in an empowering way to enable <br/>
self-governance as much as possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798250691">I&#39;m sorry Sandra I get a very defensive feeling from you.<br/>
<br/>
You ask some interesting questions.<br/>
<br/>
I think we live in a very controlled society.  <br/>
<br/>
Religiously speaking, Politically speaking, educationally speaking,<br/>
homeownership speaking,  Where our children attend school,(bussing) <br/>
economic separation, who gets the jobs, who gets the grants,  What <br/>
words are forbidden in public, what Science we can investigate and <br/>
what we can&#39;t,  Phones, emails, mail being monitored by Government <br/>
and by the business in which we work. The manipulation of food, the <br/>
control of our food supply, the fluoridation in our water, the price <br/>
of gas<br/>
Do you really think you own your home?  Try not paying tax on your <br/>
property....or how about your car.... and the day is coming when you <br/>
will no longer be able to save the seeds from your garden, you will <br/>
have to buy them because &#39;plant life&quot; is patented.<br/>
And I&#39;d say being a male or a female does matter, I don&#39;t see the <br/>
government dealing with men and birth control.<br/>
Did you know that every money transaction you make is recorded and <br/>
can be viewed by government.<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  why not let Our children reinvent the cultural wheel and <br/>
entirely, because we certainly have a lot that isn&#39;t working for many <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not against you here,  I want my kids to be free, I would like to <br/>
come from a place of guidance, and as you said  about teaching... and <br/>
I don&#39;t have that response in front of me but I was under the <br/>
impression that for you showing them the world was about giving them <br/>
experiences where they can learn without necessarily being influenced <br/>
by your beliefs or ideas.  Maybe you didn&#39;t mean that at all, that it <br/>
was I got from it.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I&#39;ve never seen the show &quot;Lost&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do tell my kids what I think is a good idea,, and then sometimes I <br/>
realize how biased I am because it was a belief instilled in me and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t have to be true or right for them.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, we haven&#39;t &quot;become&quot; a society of controllers  We have <br/>
always been, only the controls are getting a lot tighter.<br/>
<br/>
NOt sure what you are getting at with <br/>
&quot;No one within a society can be outside of the society&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm &quot;In this world but not of it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To be autonomous would be able to not be controlled by society, and <br/>
that is why I said I do not think that any of us are truly <br/>
autonomous, because we are highly involved, and invested in our <br/>
interaction with others in all the various means and ways.<br/>

&gt; &lt;g&gt;).  Not male, but that doesn&#39;t matter much these days.<br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t suggest partnership at all.<br/>
<br/>
When people have said strewing is manipulative and that being  <br/>
persuasive violates a child&#39;s autonomy, we&#39;re getting away from good  <br/>
relationships and natural learning.  It&#39;s moving toward philosophical  <br/>
rules and not toward human needs.  It&#39;s getting cold, not getting  <br/>
warm, in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was born in 1986 and has never been to school, yet I didn&#39;t join  <br/>
the AlwaysUnschooled list.  The lists I was on already had people  <br/>
whose children had never been to school, and the ideas I&#39;d picked up  <br/>
in La Leche League meetings and from reading about attachment  <br/>
parenting covered all of what it took to transition from &quot;just having  <br/>
children who were gently parented&quot; to having children who didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
school and were still gently parented, but somehow the &quot;need&quot; for a  <br/>
separate list arose, and some of the problems we&#39;ve dealt with here,  <br/>
at unschooling.info and RUNning involve people saying &quot;BUT...&quot; and  <br/>
then coming up with something that isn&#39;t at all helpful to  <br/>
unschooling.   It&#39;s frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of granulating into different lists with different  <br/>
vocabularies, I&#39;d much prefer to use plain English with as much  <br/>
analysis as people want, but not to say &quot;for purposes of this,  <br/>
&quot;manipulate&quot; will mean &quot;influence&quot; and &quot;persuade&quot; will mean &quot;bully&quot; or  <br/>
anything anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
We need less add-on and more clarity.   Explanations need to be  <br/>
simpler, not more complex, to make it more accessible.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these quotes are new (one&#39;s new the other day) and some are  <br/>
many years old, but these are the kinds of things that will help  <br/>
unschoolers more than ideas like &quot;self governance.&quot;   &quot;Governance&quot; has  <br/>
a meaning, and it is not that one governs himself.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/quotes">http://sandradodd.com/quotes</a><br/>
<br/>
Self-governance is a worse concept that &quot;self-regulation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Government and regulation involve rules and laws.  Why not talk about  <br/>
helping children learn to make decisions, as people have been  <br/>
discussing for decades?<br/>

children in learning to make decisions.<br/>
