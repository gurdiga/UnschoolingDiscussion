&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know what you could mean! Boromir is just an average ok guy, and <br/>
Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) is gorgeous! Head and shoulders above <br/>
what&#39;s-his-name &lt;g&gt;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No doubt someday I&#39;ll see that!  <br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time learning faces.  I&#39;ve always been that way.  I would be <br/>
the last to know twins apart (we lived in a twin-thick town), and mix up <br/>
siblings.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first met Keith-to-be-my-husband, he had a best friend, and everyone <br/>
called them Keith and Henry, and they were together.  Or in the SCA, Heinrich <br/>
and Gunwaldt.  I didn&#39;t need to learn them apart the first six months I knew <br/>
them.  They both went to singing practice, they both did this, they both did <br/>
all the same things.  When I DID know them apart, I saw also that one had <br/>
reddish hair and one was blonde, and one was taller, and one was heavier.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe it wasn&#39;t even the physical appearance, but their social role that I <br/>
was &quot;identifying&quot; (or not).<br/>
