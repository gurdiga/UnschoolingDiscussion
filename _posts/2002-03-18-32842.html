<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751557506">Has anyone else read &quot;Parenting with Love and Logic&quot;  it&#39;s fabulous!  <br/>
Basically it&#39;s about letting the world teach the child how to behave <br/>
through natural consequences.  Sometimes it&#39;s tough to let your child <br/>
make her own mistakes, but a lesson that they learn on their own sure <br/>
does stick a lot better than one we parents might drill into their <br/>
head.  How many of us have warned our kids repeatedly that the stove <br/>
is hot only to watch in horror as that chubby little hand reaches <br/>
toward the hot burner?  They don&#39;t advocate letting the child <br/>
endanger themselves, but a few hours spend cold or hungry teach very <br/>
strong lessons!!  That&#39;s my idea of unparenting.  I&#39;ve visited the <br/>
TCS website and it seems to me that not requiring your child to wear <br/>
a seatbelt borders on child abuse!!<br/>

This is how we know it&#39;s spring!  Wyndham starts wearing his winter <br/>
coat.  When it&#39;s 10 degrees outside, he just wears a sweat jacket.  <br/>
But come spring, there&#39;s that winter coat!<br/>
Now that I think about it, maybe it just takes him a whole season to <br/>
adjust to changing which coat to wear!<br/>

Here is what I&#39;m thinking what it means.. I&#39;d just like to be sure:<br/>
COLD: Instead of arguing with the kid who swears they won&#39;t be cold, let <br/>
them go out without their coat and don&#39;t insist they wear one. If they <br/>
are cold they will learn the &#39;natural consequence&#39;?<br/>

because the gap between the platform is too large. They told her that <br/>
there would be guides to help the kids on and off. She must of put the <br/>

it.. there were no guides at the doors and the kid fell between the train <br/>

pulled the kid to saftey just before the train took off.<br/>

gets it from his father.  I stopped telling him what and how much to wear <br/>
unless he was sick.  Then I figured I got to decide since I was the one who <br/>
would be getting up in the middle of the night with him when he was <br/>
miserable with his illness.  Now that he&#39;s older, what he wears is his <br/>
business all the time.<br/>
