I&#39;ll ask the boys when they&#39;re up. <br/>
I haven&#39;t poked around AOL for a long time.  It&#39;s in some channel&#39;s bulletin <br/>
board somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...Marty&#39;s gone for the day to the mountains and Kirby has to work when he <br/>

<br/>
Alliance of Nations Forum<br/>
Official Rules <br/>
   <br/>
         There are Six different combat style&#39;s within the AoN.     <br/>
       <br/>
 (Spar&#39;s go to 10, DM&#39;s or Death-Matches go to 13, AA&#39;s go to 13, MPC&#39;s or <br/>
Multi-Person-Combat go to 15, SM&#39;s or Slave-Matches go to 13, HM&#39;s or <br/>
Honor-Matches got to<br/>
13.)<br/>
       <br/>
       1.) Spar&#39;s...A spar is to 10. Two individuals fight. All forms of <br/>
fighting apply in a spar, all special weapons can be used. No one dies, no <br/>
rezz is lost in a Spar to 10.<br/>
New players and old players spar to see who is superior, and also to advance <br/>
to higher ranks.  <br/>
       <br/>
       2.) DM&#39;s or Death-matches...A DM is to 13. Two individuals can start a <br/>
DM. All forms of special weapons can be used. Individuals die, and rezz is <br/>
lost. DM are done to see<br/>
which player is superior over others. They can be fought for many reasons. If <br/>
one player in a room wishes to begin a DM on another. He calls forth {{ AoN <br/>
DMstrike then the persons name}} then makes his/her first hit. If one is <br/>
using a +weapon enhancer the first strike will not be with the +weapon <br/>
enhancer. After the first round, then the two individuals can activate there <br/>
+weapon enhancers if they use one. By simply stating ( activating +1 through <br/>
+5 ) of there own official +weapon enhancer which is listed in there profile. <br/>
Then and only then after stating the enhancer can it be used for the rest of <br/>
the fight. If a player is losing badly he/she may call for assisstance from <br/>
others, but only is help is asked for. Then another player can jump into the <br/>
DM to help out a friend with the fight.<br/>
Then there will be 2 individuals attacking 1 individual. The individual <br/>
lending aid to a comrade can use the +weapon enhancer on there enterence into <br/>
the DM. But must state within there description (Activating +weapon) , if not <br/>
then they can only use there Base dice, until the next round. Even though the <br/>
DM is still in play with 3 players now fighting it turns into a MPC. But the <br/>
fight will still only go to 13, as the original fight began as a DM not an <br/>
MPC. If further aid is requested by another player in the DM, now MPC. <br/>
Another player can jump in and pull one of the 2 attacking the 1 out of the <br/>
MPC. Thus starting another<br/>
seperate DM, which will go to 13. This leaves the original 2 fighters , and a <br/>
new DM with 2 fighters. IF further aid is called for another player can jump <br/>
into the first battle making it 3 players and a MPC, as well as the 2 battle <br/>
making it a secound MPC.<br/>
       Also During the first and secound battles of 3 individuals now. If one <br/>
dies following the original DM to 13 rule. Still another can jump into that <br/>
fight, and continue the fight if so warrented. Only then aid does not have to <br/>
be asked for...then we get into the area known as MCC or Mass Chaos Combat. <br/>
Which can be deadly..and many can die..and the whole room, is in a War, which <br/>
started from the original DM. And all fights still go to 13. All<br/>
losers souls go to Hades. for a period of 24 hours. before they can be rezzed <br/>
by eather there  own god/ goddess or by there own Elders.Gods/goddess&#39;s can <br/>
rezz there own mortals, but only Elders can rezz gods/goddess&#39;s.<br/>
       <br/>
       3.) AA&#39;s or Assasination Attempts...any rank of individual within the <br/>
forum from Elder God to Soldier can AA anyone they so chose. This is done by, <br/>
appearing in a room and<br/>
within 5 secounds of arriving one states {{AoN AA the name of the person <br/>
being attacked}} the description short, and the roll. For the initial AA <br/>
attack one cannot use there +<br/>
weapon enhancers only there base dice listed in there profiles . Example:  <br/>
Jaran shaitan runs in and slams his dagger into Ravian belle...{{AoN  AA.}} <br/>
his base dice as a king is 2d48+3 , so he rolls and gets a 32 40  which is <br/>
scored as 3+4=7 point hit...now , the the one being AAed  can eather clain <br/>
CI, which is explained further down or roll there base dice . Ravian belle is <br/>
a goddess she rolls 2d50 without her +4 weapon enhancer . &quot;Ravian tries to<br/>
block with an energy shield and  pokes jaran in the eye with her finger&quot;...41 <br/>
27...here you see she blocked with 4 points of her DR, so the score would <br/>
be..7 pts hit-4 pt block = a 3 point hit or score 3-0 Jaran.  After the first <br/>
roll, the one being AAed has two choses. They can defend and roll with there <br/>
base dice no +weapon enhancers, or they can call CI or &quot;Combat inhibitions&quot;. <br/>
If CI is stated, then they have to leave the room for 13 minutes. And the AA <br/>
is over. No one dies, no rezz is lost. If the player attacked takes the AA, <br/>
and defends. Then the fight reverts to a DM, which will go to 13. Also if the <br/>
assassin appears and attacks and rolls a doubles of any number, or even a 1  <br/>
1, then the AA is considerd <br/>
       &quot;Perfect&quot; , and the one which is attacked dies.  Then the AA is over. <br/>
The Assassin can stay, or leave. If the AA goes to a DM, on the 2nd round <br/>
both fighters can then<br/>
activate there +weapons, and all special attacks can be used. If successful <br/>
the loser dies, there soul goes to hades...where they stay for 24 hours then <br/>
they can be rezzed by there god/goddess, or there own Elders..gods/goddess&#39;s <br/>
can rezz there own mortals, only Elders can rezz Gods/goddess&#39;s.<br/>
       <br/>
       4.) MPC&#39;s or Multi-person-combats....an MPC goes to 15. This form of <br/>
combat is used mainly if 1 person begins a fight against 2 other individuals. <br/>
Most of the time that<br/>
madness, but it can be enjoyable. The roll of Initials is first done.. <br/>
//roll-dice1-sides6...and then the three sees who will go first and it is <br/>
followed in order throughout the MPC to 15. Only in an MPC can all 3 players <br/>
activate there +weapon enhancers within there description prior to there <br/>
first foll. Then they can use there +weapons for the remainder of the match, <br/>
to 15. All special attacks can be used in an MPC. Also if assistence is <br/>
called for<br/>
another can jump into the MPC and pull one of the fighters off, thus starting <br/>
a DM on the side which will and only then go to 15. For its a spin off of the <br/>
original MPC which goes to 15. Some perfer to be honorable and fight for <br/>
themselves. But it is an option to call for assisstance from others. When the <br/>
loser gets to 15 he simply blocks, and dies...there soul is sent to ha<br/>
des..and stays for 24 hours, then there god/goddess, or there Elders can rezz<br/>
them. God/goddess can rezz there own mortals, only Elders can rezz gods/ <br/>
goddess&#39;s...<br/>
       <br/>
       5.) SM&#39;s or Slave-Matches...Anyone from Elder to soldier can SM anyone <br/>
else. SM&#39;s go to 13. Slave matches are all for only 1 mun week. Anything can <br/>
be done to the loser of<br/>
the SM except un-siring of other individuals.<br/>
       All special attacks can be used. To do a SM its simular to an AA. The <br/>
one starting the SM appears in a room, states {{AoN SM names the person}} <br/>
describes the attack, and<br/>
rolls. As in an AA, +weapon enhancers are not used just the base dice which <br/>
is listed in the individuals profile is used first.<br/>
       No CI can be used. After the initial attack is made the SMed one <br/>
describes his/her defence and roll using just there base dice no +weapon <br/>
enhancers.<br/>
       After the first round both combatents then can activate there +weapon <br/>
enhancer if they use any, but it must be stated in there description. <br/>
(activating + weapons) then they<br/>
can use there +weapons for the remainder of the match. As stated the match <br/>
goes to 13. No deaths in a SM, no rezz is lost. SM&#39;s are 1 on 1 no aid can be <br/>
given except a healing by a god/or goddess and it has to be asked for stated <br/>
in the room...also when one loses a Slave match they have to put in there <br/>
profiles {{ SN slave to whoever}} and keep it in there profile till the 1 <br/>
week is over, or they are freed by a HM..from someone else..also no slave<br/>
can do a DM, MPC, AA, or SM to anyone else unless they have permission by <br/>
there master or mistress first..no permission fights will be invalid..no <br/>
slave can be owned by two masters/mistress&#39;s.<br/>
       <br/>
       6.) HM&#39;s or Honor-Matches...HM&#39;s go to 13. They are used to settle <br/>
disagreements between two individuals. No one dies, no rezz is lost. All <br/>
special attacks can be used. Also<br/>
if someone wishes to challenge someone to free a slave from a SM. Then and HM <br/>
can be fought. If the challenger wins. The slave is set free. If the <br/>
challenger loses the HM. He or She is not enslaved, no death, no rezz <br/>
lost..anyone from Elder to soldier can do a HM.<br/>
       Hm&#39;s are 1 to 1 individuals fights, no one can interfear in a HM, no <br/>
assasstence can be asked for...for it is an Honor Match. No healing can be <br/>
asked for eather.<br/>
  <br/>

       Peasant (2d22) Rezz 1 total<br/>
 <br/>
       <br/>
       Special Attacks:<br/>
       <br/>
       1.) (KO&#39;s) or Knock-outs...during any of the six combat forms of <br/>
fighting within AoN, one can use (KO&#39;s). This is simply done when describing <br/>
your defense and attack at the<br/>
end of said description you place a (KO1). Then you roll your dice. If <br/>
doubled come up, any type of doubles even a 1 1, you have knocked out your <br/>
opponent. And they will be out-cold for 1 round. Meaning you  roll again, and <br/>
your oppenent takes more damage because they have been knocked-out. If <br/>
doubles are not rolled the fight continues as normal. One can use 3 (KO&#39;s) in <br/>
a match. make sure you keep track of the number you have used.(you must put a<br/>
(KO1, KO2, or KO3) within your description or the doubles will not be counted <br/>
as a knockout. no exceptions.<br/>
       <br/>
       2.) *TA* or Total Attack...*TA* can be used once in any type of match. <br/>
Since it is a total attack there is no defense in your roll. Example: 34 23. <br/>
normally the 34 would be<br/>
your DR, and the 23 would be your AR. Except by using a *TA* you simply add <br/>
the first #&#39;s of each roll togeather or (3+2=5 or a 5 point hit.) If your <br/>
roll is higher the same thing applies. It can be a deadly special attack..if <br/>
used at the right time.And it must be mentioned in your discription before <br/>
your roll as *TA* for it to work.<br/>
       <br/>
       3.) *TD* or Total defense...can be used once within any match. Ruffly <br/>
the same as a *TA*, but the reverse of it. As well it must be stated within <br/>
your description *TD* for<br/>
it to work before you roll. Example: You roll a 45 18.<br/>
       Now usually your DR would be 45 and your AR would be 18. Except you <br/>
already stated it to be a *TD*. so its a total defensive move. You simply add <br/>
the first #&#39;s of each roll togeather or (4+1=5 or a 5 point defense roll.) If <br/>
you roll higher your defense will be greater. *TD* can be used to block a <br/>
*US* if it has not be used yet in a match. And only if the *TD* is higher <br/>
than the *US* used. Its also used against a *TA* or total attack.<br/>
       <br/>
       4.) *US* or Ultimate Sacrifice...something to use if your about to <br/>
die, and you have used all of your other special attacks and defenses.... So, <br/>
you discribe your last bit<br/>
of energy list *US*, and roll. Except since its a total last attack there is <br/>
no defense to your *US*. <br/>
       and instead of using 2d you use 1d. Example: AdephNull:: he&#39;s almost <br/>
dead but he has one last card to play and with the last of his strength he <br/>
hits his enemy with a blast of energy *US* and then falls to his knees <br/>
dazed:: (he would then roll //roll-dice1-sides120...because his normal dice <br/>
of 2d60 is doubled and since its a complete last attack only 1dice is use) <br/>
and it comes up AdephNull rolls 99...meaning he just hit his enemy with a 9 <br/>
point<br/>
hit. Which could kill the enemy. If the enemies own score is high. But if the <br/>
roll came up  less he would be out for 1 round...and would probably die. *US* <br/>
move is always the last<br/>
thing one tries if there almost dead..<br/>
       <br/>
       5.) healing...during a DM, MPC, SM, <br/>
Elders, gods/godess&#39;s can step into a fight as long as there are not more <br/>
than 3 people already fighting and &quot;Heal&quot; someone. And it has to be asked for <br/>
in the room not in im&#39;s. This is done by the person discribing the act of <br/>
healing with energy of some kind then the roll. Example: 34 42. The AR is 42 <br/>
or a 4 point<br/>
heal. Now the one accepting the healing to lower his score has to simply <br/>
block his enemy and state he is &quot;accepting healing&quot; and uses only 1dice...or <br/>
::TekLordMoi sends healing power into AdephNull:: 22 50. the AR is 50 so its <br/>
a 5 point heal. ::AdephNull kneels and accepts the healing only blocking his <br/>
enemy:: 1d65 and he gets a 44. Thus he blocks his enemy and accepts the 5 <br/>
points of healing from TekLordMoi. Which drops his score by those 5 points<br/>
of healing. Then the match continues..<br/>
       <br/>
       6.) Max-0ut...or Max-out of AR. If any individual maxes out his or her <br/>
AR example:: ShaitisX rolls as a god 2d54 and his roll comes up as <br/>
       38 54...that is considered at Max-out on his AR...which he would <br/>
automatically get a 5 point hit. The first # of the AR roll is the number of <br/>
the max-out. Enhancers included. nothing can block a maxout, not even a <br/>
*TD*...so no need to waste it..<br/>

      7.) Regular block...can be used as a defense against *TA* but only one <br/>
time during a match, or against a *US* if it has not been used yet. Its <br/>
rolled as example:: <br/>
//roll-dice1-sides65...meaning its all DR defense no AR attack...example:: <br/>
Pertinaxx blasts baronLocke with a surge of proton energy which rips through <br/>
his armor and sizzles the elder as he falls backwards :: roll comes up 60 <br/>
64....::Baronlocke having used all his special attacks and defenses already <br/>
goes for the old simply block with a energy shield which surrounds him and <br/>
wards off that powerful energy blast:: he rolls<br/>
     1d65 for he is an elder and his +weapon is included in the block, it <br/>
comes up a 65 DR...which block pertinaxx&#39;s AR of 64..so the score would be <br/>
the same, and the match would continue. Thats the use of the 1d roll..for <br/>
defense.<br/>
     <br/>
  <br/>
       Normal combat:<br/>
       <br/>
       For the new players and the old players a refresher on this. I&#39;ll make <br/>
it simple.<br/>
       Your first roll is called the DR or Defense roll, the 2nd roll is <br/>
called your AR or your Attack roll..Example:: 45 50...DR is 45, AR is 50. To <br/>
score points one always scores from the AR to your opponents DR.<br/>
       Now an example of a few rounds of simple combat:<br/>
       BaronLocke:: he swings his sword and chops through pertinaxx&#39;s left <br/>
arm severing it and blood splashes the crowd:: 43 50....(his DR is 43 his AR <br/>
is 50)<br/>
       Pertinaxx:: steps into the chop shorting the distance and paries his <br/>
sword with his own sword, knocking it to the left, then a secret blade shoots <br/>
out from the pommel of his own sword, and hit baronlocke in the neck <br/>
impailing him and blood splashes the crowd:: 51 38. (here we see that <br/>
pertinaxx defended baronLockes AR of 50 with his own DR of 51, and pertinaxx <br/>
also attacked with a 38 AR, which the Baron will have to block on his next <br/>
roll.) so<br/>
the score ( 0-baronlocke 0-pertinaxx or simply 0-0)<br/>
       BaronLocke:: He raises an energy shield and Pertinaxx&#39;s secret blade <br/>
bounces off and does him no damage, then he spins and thrusts his sword into <br/>
Pertinaxx&#39;s chest ripping it out the left side (KO1)::<br/>
       36 43...(here we see the barons DR is 36 but he had to block <br/>
pertinaxx&#39;s AR of 38 which he doesn&#39;t so 38-36=2 so a 1 point hit is made. <br/>
And Pertinaxx&#39;s has to defend baronlockes AR of 43 on his next roll, Also you <br/>
noticed the Baron went for a (KO1) which he tried to get doubles. If he had <br/>
succeeded Pertinaxx would have been knocked out for 1 round, and the baron <br/>
would have gone again. Thus pertinaxx would have gotten more damage. But the <br/>
score<br/>
is now 1-0 P.)<br/>
       Thats simple combat.<br/>
  <br/>
      <br/>
       Note: +4 weapon enhancer given to any RD&#39;s is for killing a God, God<br/>
dess, or Elder God.</div>
