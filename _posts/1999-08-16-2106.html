 </span></blockquote>I have an anecdote for you.  Yesterday we found a tiny spider crawling<br/>
across the floor of my sons&#39; room while we were playing together.  Usually<br/>
I let spiders go outside, telling the boys that bugs like to live in the<br/>
garden.  Unless it&#39;s a Hobo (Dangerously venomous spiders we have in<br/>
abundance here, in the same neurotoxin class as Black Widows and Brown<br/>
Recluses.)  Anyhow I pointed out this tiny (ant sized) spider to my 2 year<br/>
old and he promptly tried to pick it up between his fingers.  I said &quot;No!<br/>
Drop It!&quot;  So he dropped the mushed ball that was once a spider, and he said,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Spider wans ta walk some more.  He wans ta walk, Mommy.&quot;  Then, after<br/>
studying the lifeless form for a moment, &quot;I Broke it, Mommy!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I explained that, just like with the cats, we have to be careful with all<br/>
animals, and that particular spider would not be walking anymore.  He<br/>
forgot about it shortly.  It was one of those precious moments...&quot;I Broke<br/>
it Mommy!!&quot;<br/>
