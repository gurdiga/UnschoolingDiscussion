<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849546955">Welcome, from another one of those &quot;devil worshippers.&quot;  That is the great<br/>
thing about homeschooling the kidlets, I can tell them the truth about our<br/>
heritage and not have some nut telling them tall tales and lies!!!  It also<br/>
allows us to be who we are and to actually study other religions in a<br/>
non-threatening, unbiased way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How wonderful for your son to be learning about his rich heritage.  I wish I had such a legacy to impart to my children.  However, being a multi-European mix, with no particular family culture, religion, history, etc to pass on, I have very little to offer them in terms of heritage.  I have only one grandparent, and have not spent much time with her in my life, plus she is not the storyteller type.  My parents are also.......less than forthcoming about family history, nor do I enjoy spending much time with them due to their dysfunctionality.<br/>
<br/>
BUT!!  I can pass on my own spiritual and religious beliefs that I have developed in my life.  We create our own family traditions to pass on to our children.  We are what is generally called &quot;eclectic Pagans&quot; with beliefs mixed from all the influences that are important in our lives.  We practice a mix of European traditions and Native American traditions, being Americans with European roots.  <br/>

Too weird for me.  <br/>

If there is only one all-powerful God then all the heathen other-stuff is <br/>
nothing, make-believe, powerless.<br/>

I think philosophical issues like these are right there with the basis of <br/>
unschooling.  People will base their lives on some pretty weird stuff.  So <br/>
are we, basing our lives on the idea that people so much want and need to <br/>
learn that all you need to do is keep them healthy and busy and useful <br/>
information will just fill them up to the top and overflow!!  (I believe <br/>
that, but I am in the minority in this country and in Western Culture on that <br/>
topic.)<br/>
<br/>
People who know nothing of Christianity and the Christian homeschooling <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851258050">We deal with this a lot since my husband is a youth minister. Many<br/>
stories like &quot;they told me I wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to have my bible at school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since when did that new legislation come about. They could try and give<br/>
some insight <br/>
into others beliefs/differences. Isn&#39;t that the curriculum? Respect<br/>
others differences.<br/>
Or couldn&#39;t they be happy the child is at least reading?<br/>
We also recently had a conversation with a girl in 10th grade ps who had<br/>
to read three books of the bible and write reports on each book.<br/>
Religious or not what a great assignment. She didn&#39;t own a bible and had<br/>
no clue that there were so many.<br/>
They also read and fif reports on other religious books. Wonder how they<br/>
got away with that one?<br/>

&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;   It was<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s funny--because nobody believes in the power of the devil (or even<br/>
&gt;&gt; BELIEVES in &quot;the devil&quot;) like Christians.  And to suspend a kid from school<br/>
&gt;&gt; for casting a spell must mean that they acknowledge the potential power of<br/>
&gt;&gt; that spell and therefore give credence and power to whatever believe system<br/>
&gt;&gt; is behind it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Too weird for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; If there is only one all-powerful God then all the heathen other-stuff is<br/>
&gt;&gt; nothing, make-believe, powerless.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I think philosophical issues like these are right there with the basis of<br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling.  People will base their lives on some pretty weird stuff.  So<br/>
&gt;&gt; are we, basing our lives on the idea that people so much want and need to<br/>
&gt;&gt; learn that all you need to do is keep them healthy and busy and useful<br/>
&gt;&gt; information will just fill them up to the top and overflow!!  (I believe<br/>
&gt;&gt; that, but I am in the minority in this country and in Western Culture on<br/>
&gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt;&gt; topic.)<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; People who know nothing of Christianity and the Christian homeschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt; movement will be unprepared to answer questions or defend their own beliefs<br/>
&gt;&gt; when challenged about homeschooling, the history of homeschooling, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; whether children MUST have discipline, schedules, pressure, etc.  These<br/>
&gt;&gt; kinds<br/>
&gt;&gt; of &quot;educational theories&quot; are deeply rooted in western religion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi all, is everyone have a good day. The sun is shining here for a change and <br/>
so we are thrilled. <br/>
<br/>
I told myself I was not going to join in on this discussion as everyone <br/>
always gets upset and angry when religion is the subject. Changed my mind :)<br/>
    I enjoyed reading Sandra&#39;s remarks about Satanism because the kids and I <br/>
have been reading up on Halloween after an adult friend of my daughters told <br/>
her Halloween was Satan&#39;s holiday. It got us curious as to how this theory <br/>
came about. Of course when we researched it we found nothing about Satanism <br/>
but instead read all about Paganism. Very interesting. Learned a lot of <br/>
history. I wonder how all these Satan ideas got started.<br/>
I also thought Sandra&#39;s remarks about Christianity being based on human <br/>
sacrifice and cannibalism was interesting. We just saw a show on the Travel <br/>
Channel about how horridly cruel people were to each other. And yes they were <br/>
Catholic (as that was the only Christians at that time ). An example would be <br/>
witch burning, caused by the fear of Christians of witchcraft (and also just <br/>
a good way to get rid of someone you did not like). Lets face it, humans have <br/>
a bloody horrid history. <br/>
<br/>
Religion. It certainly seems to bring out both the worst and the best in <br/>
people. I am not talking about anyone on this list. I am thinking of my <br/>
experiences with people I have known. I have know people who argue that their <br/>
doctrine is the right one, they argue even though no one is challenging them <br/>
or wanting to debate it. I have known people who do not even want to talk to <br/>
people outside their faith. Personally I do not enjoy arguing religion. I do <br/>
enjoy reading about religions and their histories. For example I did not even <br/>
realize that there were still Pagans until I got online. I live in rural Ks <br/>
what can I say. I encouraged the kids to read up on the Pagan religion when <br/>
they came to me saying they has met new Pagan epals. I also encouraged them <br/>
to read up on Buddhism when they had a big interest in Japan. Information <br/>
will help them make decisions when they are adults. I cannot force them to <br/>
follow me, the time is getting near when they will have to make their own <br/>
choices. ( and besides, half the time I am lost anyway).<br/>
<br/>
I believe in being kind to everyone, no matter what. I try hard not to judge. <br/>
Being non judgmental is one of humanities biggest hurdles I think. <br/>
Do not let the views on this list make you angry. This is a good list and I <br/>
would hate to see it go. Keep in mind that when expressing an opinion <br/>
feelings could be hurt. So be careful <br/>
Have a great day<br/>
<br/>
peace and grace<br/>

anyone else&#39;s beliefs ridiculous. If there is something to be learned about<br/>
another person&#39;s religion, I&#39;d like to see it. If we have articles or<br/>
information or resources to share about religions, that&#39;s great. But<br/>
opinions from someone of one religion about the beliefs of someone from<br/>
another religion crosses the boundaries of what I personally feel<br/>
comfortable with on an Unschooling list. That&#39;s just my opinion, and I don&#39;t<br/>
really happen to belong to any of the religions being discussed. It&#39;s just<br/>
that if I wanted religious debate, there are plenty of other lists I would<br/>
join. Thanks for listening.<br/>
And Shelli, I&#39;m not trying to pick on your post specifically, there are<br/>
several in this thread that felt uncomfortable to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922429147">I agree with Robin. I think respect for each others beliefs is the way to go. <br/>
Sometimes I have a hard time understanding how others can believe what they <br/>
do. Then I think how my beliefs and practices might look from the outside:&gt;) <br/>
After all belief is of the inner realm. Perhaps we could focus on sharing in <br/>
a positive way how it is that our varied points of view have led us to the <br/>
similar place of unschooling our children. Let&#39;s keep the list focused on <br/>
unschooling. Sincerely, Amalia Darling</div>

&quot;old&quot; testament) does say that one is not allowed to believe in other <br/>
deities and some of the horrible things one is supposed to do to <br/>
people who believe in them, giving power to other deities does <br/>
have a basis in Judeo-Christian (possibly Muslim?) religious <br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
I am coming from the perspective of having been an &quot;ultra&quot; <br/>
orthodox Jew for seven years up to a couple years ago who is now <br/>
a confident atheist who has very little to do with organized religion.  I <br/>
cannot speak for Christianity, but I know, from the Jewish <br/>
perspective, what one is supposed to think of and do to people who <br/>
don&#39;t worship the Jewish God, and that information comes directly <br/>
from the &quot;old&quot; (old in parentheses because there is no &quot;new&quot; to <br/>
Jews) testament, which Jews share in common with Christians.<br/>
<br/>
As I see it, the bible is full of contradictions, from the very beginning <br/>
(no pun intended).  To be a religious Jew or Christian means <br/>
accepting and even learning from these contradictions.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please tell me if I haven&#39;t made sense with this yet, because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an important point for people to understand, and many who have<br/>

&gt; surprised to hear that as they are to hear that Christianity is<br/>
&gt; based on human sacrifice and cannibalism. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am right there with you, as you might suppose since I rejected my <br/>
once strongly-held beliefs, but I hope you do understand that what <br/>
you are saying cannot help but be seen as very offensive by those <br/>
who believe strongly in God and in the bible as God&#39;s written word <br/>
(which is what orthodox Jews believe as well as many religious <br/>
Christians).<br/>
<br/>
What you are saying is perhaps a nicer way of viewing God and <br/>
religion, but it is not the God and religion of the bible.<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me if I am not so clear.  I am suffering from the flu <br/>

&lt;&lt; May I please respectfully ask that we on this list refrain from calling<br/>
 anyone else&#39;s beliefs ridiculous. If there is something to be learned about<br/>
 another person&#39;s religion, I&#39;d like to see it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What we learned in the original post (which I don&#39;t have and which had <br/>
another subject line) was a little boy was called a satan worshipper for <br/>
being pagan.  Was he in school?  Then perhaps our own proper/allowable <br/>
response was &quot;Take him out and homeschool him to avoid this in the future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Was he homeschooled?  Then by discussing what might be said by him in his own <br/>
defense in the future, or discussing why the other children might have said <br/>
or believed he was a satan worshipper seems to me to be directly applicable <br/>
to the question which was asked.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone posted here that they were going to a Jewish wedding or funeral <br/>
(or Catholic, or Buddhist) and didn&#39;t know how to act, and if people on this <br/>
list made recommendations, would that be discussing religion?<br/>
<br/>
Religion is a *HUGE* part of life, of homeschooling, of history, of politics, <br/>
of geography.  I don&#39;t really understand how an unschooling family can tell a <br/>
religious discussion to shush as inapplicable to unschooling.  Unschooling <br/>
itself--the term and the practice--has huge repercussions on the <br/>
homeschooling movement, and most of that is directly related to religion (or <br/>
lack thereof, or conflict with).<br/>

There are Christian homeschoolers who will not use the term &quot;unschool&quot; (not <br/>
that it&#39;s a great term, but it&#39;s a term in use) because other Christians <br/>
consider it immoral and anti-Christian not to have children &quot;do their work&quot; <br/>
in obedience to the parents, or not to have children following a Christian <br/>
curriculum.  There are even Christian dictionaries and piano courses.  To <br/>
allow or encourage children to freely and openly inquire and investigate <br/>
things goes against some people&#39;s Christian belief and practice.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA first would allow but wouldn&#39;t defend (in a legal situation) <br/>
unschooling families.  Now, if I understand correctly, they won&#39;t even let <br/>
them join (which doesn&#39;t hurt the families).  <br/>
<br/>
There are many homeschooling support groups which won&#39;t allow unschoolers to <br/>
join (nor even structured homeschoolers who won&#39;t sign a statement of faith).<br/>
<br/>
Within and among the Christian, structured homeschoolers there are beliefs <br/>
and traditions fostered that it was Christian homeschoolers who made <br/>
homeschooling possible and that unschoolers threaten the rights of people <br/>
everywhere to homeschool.  It&#39;s not at all true, but it is widely stated, <br/>
believed and repeated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not particularly involved in or interested in the politics and legalities <br/>
of homeschooling.  I much prefer the practice:  the cognitive growth and <br/>
mental health benefits of unschooling.  Even there, though, religious issues <br/>
come up.<br/>

Candy, I wanted to say I enjoyed your post....<br/>
<br/>
Also, there has been a great series of articles about The History Of<br/>
Homeschooling in Gentle Spirit Magazine, including of course, religious<br/>
issues. I like both Gentle Spirit and Home Education Magazine.....GS has<br/>
very long, in-depth articles. The history of homeschooling has taken the<br/>
last 5 issues, I think.<br/>

I agree. The politics tend to bore me because they are so removed from my <br/>
reality. I am fortunate to interact with a lot of Christian unschoolers. I <br/>
have been on two Christian unschooling groups and as an educational <br/>
philosophy it seems to be growing among Christians, though it will not likely <br/>
catch up with the other approach any time soon. I have met people who are <br/>
very conservative in other aspects of their lives who have embraced <br/>
unschooling and are forming inclusive support groups. (I know you weren&#39;t <br/>
painting us all with the same brush, just want to say there is hope.)<br/>

This has been my experience. I get looks a patient amusement when other <br/>
Christians learn I don&#39;t spank. When they figure out I really DO unschool and <br/>
am not just a &quot;relaxed home schooler&quot; they begin to get nervous. When they <br/>
realize that I&#39;m trying to be less  coercive they go balistic.<br/>
<br/>
This would be fine if their reaction was limited to what they say to me but <br/>
it transfers to the kids as well. They seem to lie in wait for my kids to do <br/>
something that they can stick in my face as an indictment against my <br/>
parenting. I guess they need to completely invalidate my choices in order to <br/>
be comfortable with their own. Our experience with Christian support groups <br/>
has been horrible. We choose now to associate with those who share most of <br/>
our convictions about parenting or those who are self-confident enough to not <br/>
judge.<br/>
