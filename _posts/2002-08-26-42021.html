<div id="ygrps-yiv-475349755"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When was the last time anyone posted something here that was actually about<br/>
&gt; UNschooling? I can&#39;t remember it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, Ned.  You must not have read the same posts I read.  Now, I get mine on<br/>
digest, in Europe, so my concept of &quot;days&quot; doesn&#39;t look quite like yours,<br/>
perhaps.  But today, and in the last couple days, I&#39;ve read several people&#39;s<br/>
comments on how they know unschooling is working for them, posted in<br/>
response to a request by someone.  I&#39;ve participated in a discussion about<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling in the military, and in states with somewhat<br/>
more iritating laws.  And I&#39;ve read some interesting comments on Rap, which<br/>
I know absolutely nothing about, which have been enlightening and also<br/>
somewhat iritating.<br/>
<br/>
Ned, I like this list.  I don&#39;t consider myself an old-timer, since I&#39;ve<br/>
been here since March or April (I forget which).  But I have enjoyed the<br/>
diversity of subjects and the diversity of opinions.  If you don&#39;t like the<br/>
owner or the moderator, then by all means leave.  However, if you stay,<br/>
please stop complaining.  It&#39;s not attractive in children, and it&#39;s no<br/>
better when the &quot;child&quot; is over 40.<br/>
