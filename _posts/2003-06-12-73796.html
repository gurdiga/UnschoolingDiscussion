 </span></blockquote>Well if it makes you feel any better...I&#39;ve travelled all over the place<br/>
with <br/>
just the kids and I. The last conference it was just me and the kids, Jalen <br/>
was only one y.o. at the time. It&#39;s totally doable!!! And fun...but then I<br/>
am <br/>
the adventurous type. It&#39;s that ENFP thing. :)<br/>

ahhh, maybe being an INFP is why I&#39;m nervous about it..lol.  If we do go it<br/>
without dad, a cell phone will be a must, that will help I think.  We don&#39;t<br/>
have one now.<br/>
