<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018533611">I did NOT know this word could be used in an offensive way either.  We have read quite a few books on the history of Indians this year and come to think of it I have NEVER seen the word &quot;squaw&quot;.  However, I always thought it meant the wife or woman of the male Indian.  <br/>
<br/>
Did &quot;squaw&quot; used to be just a regular word and then over time came to have negative usage?  PLEASE don&#39;t start a thread on this!! ...I was just curious.  <br/>
<br/>
Like today the word &quot;MOM&quot; tends to be used negatively.  As in, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re JUST a mom?&quot;<br/>
