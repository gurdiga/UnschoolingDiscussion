<div id="ygrps-yiv-656896506">What about beauty in the arts?<br/>
<br/>
Artworks can be downloaded online, shown, discussed - just 1, or 2 for<br/>
contrast<br/>
<br/>
Dance/Movement - play music, let them move - Are some movements more<br/>
beautiful than others?  Consider various dances, but also things like<br/>
military marching, goosestepping...<br/>
<br/>
Music - different styles.  Does classical/country/pop/rock or other types<br/>
have beauty.  Could be good discussion - beauty is in the eye and the ear of<br/>
the beholder/listener...<br/>
<br/>
Instruments - did you say you play?  The ululele, wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
You play something, let them play - Is beauty in the final product or the<br/>
journey to get there?  (My parents discouraged me when I played violin, as<br/>
they would always shout &quot;stop that racket!&quot;  I still won&#39;t play in front of<br/>
people.)  Discover beauty in sounds...<br/>
<br/>
Let each write a word that can be beautiful to them, then decorate it<br/>
(large, on construction or drawing paper, or with paints if available).<br/>
Words could be ideas, such as &quot;Joy&quot; or things, such as animals, or even<br/>
people, or their own name.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

It sounds like a wonderful day!  Beauty is truly all around us.  I&#39;m<br/>
thankful that as unschoolers we have the time and inclination to see it.<br/>
