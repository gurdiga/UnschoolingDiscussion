<div id="ygrps-yiv-631766720">I&#39;m looking for suggestions of songs that are encouraging for people <br/>
living the unschooling lifestyle.  I need good music to listen to <br/>
while I&#39;m doing this joyful housework. <br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve thought of &quot;The greatest love of All&quot; by Whitney Houston <br/>
and &quot;On Children&quot;, the poem that was put to music that someone <br/>
recommended a few weeks ago.  Any other suggestions?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592301159">Not sure if unschooling songs are going to do it. Good music is anything<br/>
that *you* really like and enjoy. That will make listening to it fun. Pick<br/>
what you are into. Which reminds to check out my new Rod Stewart cd I got<br/>
for Christmas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496186156">I have a tendency to choose music because of the lyrics more often <br/>
than because of the music.  And right now what I&#39;m most into is <br/>
trying to be a joyful, peaceful mom.  It&#39;s not always easy to do <br/>
that, and I think that the right lyrics in the background sometimes <br/>
might be a boost. :) <br/>
<br/>
I thought of another one--Cats in the Cradle. <br/>

That is the song I remember when my Dad when he left us (I was 8) and the one <br/>
he would play on visits with the lyrics &quot;This will be the day that I die&quot;. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know the second was my dads song until I was listening to it a few <br/>
weeks ago and my sister said &quot;you know that&#39;s the song dad used to play in the car <br/>
when he picked us up for visits&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here are some songs I listen to on top of those......<br/>
Child of Mine Carol King<br/>
My Girl Al Greene<br/>
Teach Your Children Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young<br/>
Ooh Child Marvin Gaye/spinners/Five Stairsteps<br/>
Baby I love Your Way Peter Frampton<br/>
Ordinary Day Vanessa Carlton<br/>
Time of Your Life  Green Day<br/>
We will rock you   Queen<br/>
Seven Nation Army White Stripes<br/>
I also have a few CD&#39;s with 70&#39;s music on them but I cannot recall the songs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744522497">My dad would always play &quot;Joy to the World&quot; because my younger brother&#39;s name is Jeremiah, and his nickname was Bullfrog when he was a baby, because he was a large baby and had some wild burps!  We also listened to alot of Alabama with my dad (they were divorced, so the times we saw Dad were few and far between unfortunately). <br/>
<br/>
With my mother, I grew up listening to Simon and Garfunkle, Carly Simon, Barbara Streisand, Phil Collins...a rather varied mix of music really, because we&#39;d listen to just about anything, but those artists are the ones who really stand out in my mind.<br/>
