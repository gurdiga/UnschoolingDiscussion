&lt;&lt; The *correct* answer is to shop at locally owned stores stocked with<br/>
 locally made products.  My dilemma is my budget.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yeah, that nasty old reality keeps cropping up here too!  I am finding that <br/>
this is yet another thing that I may or may not be so PC about.  Yes, I like <br/>
the cute little Xmas tree stand in our cute little town.  But Home Depot just <br/>
advertised Xmas trees for 1/2 the price.  That $25-30 buys a lot of gifts for <br/>
my kids at the Dollar store.  So I will be a &quot;bad person&quot; and buy from Home <br/>
Depot.  <br/>
