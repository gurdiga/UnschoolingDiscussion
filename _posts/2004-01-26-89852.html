<div id="ygrps-yiv-579951494">&lt;&lt;Holly and I went to Target last night.  Took our time.  Mostly socks and <br/>
underwear, one toy she knew she wanted before she got there, a pair of new <br/>
kid-Fiskars, a box of cereal on sale.   Leisurely, warm, safe, not too far from home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or check out check out a different one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To fight the stir-crazies we tried out something new this week - the kids had never been skiing.  We spent a couple days at my Mom&#39;s and went to the ski hill where she is a member (at least for the first day - only one of the three kids enjoyed it so we changed our plans for day 2).  And just change of location for a couple days helps.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun, but that evening my daughter and I checked out &quot;her&quot; Wal-Mart and had a great time!  Quite different stock from ours, though she&#39;s only an hour away.  My daughter found a dressing gown 60% off and a lace nightgown, we found an alarm clock and MIB on tape really cheap for my youngest son (he&#39;s 6 and loves MIB2 and has been playing constantly with his new clock), and I found Henry V on DVD (have never seen it before - our library doesn&#39;t have it - but after rave reviews here I&#39;m eager to watch it).  And we picked up some Krispy Kreme donuts there to take back for the eldest as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
It was snowing when we finally left, but we were in no rush so we drove back to my Mom&#39;s slowly and enjoyed watching blizzard. We were so excited the rest of the night about our great finds. :-)<br/>

I went to Thornberry, Texas to visit some friends and had a blast on a <br/>
trip to Walmart. They had lard in BUCKETS!!! &lt;G&gt; They had big huge <br/>
boxes of frozen catfish. They had half an aisle of all kinds of <br/>
cornmeal (I thought there was only one kind in the world &lt;G&gt;). They <br/>
sold cowboy hats and boots and big silver belt buckles. And meat <br/>
smokers.<br/>

Ours sells boogie boards and beach umbrellas.<br/>
