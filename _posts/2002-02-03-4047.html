True.  <br/>

A set of priorities?<br/>

<br/>
Holt managed to write a lot of books without ever defining<br/>
unschooling.  Even if you don&#39;t define it, there&#39;s still<br/>
plenty to talk about.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Use your imagination.  Are there any other possible ways<br/>
to help people that don&#39;t involve giving them definitions<br/>
that don&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me so much of people who say, &quot;Well, how will<br/>
they ever learn to read without basal readers?&quot;  That would<br/>
be a good point if basal readers were the only written matter <br/>
in the world.  Fortunately, we don&#39;t live in that world.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ways that I&#39;ve seen people move into unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
* Hearing or seeing days in the lives of unschoolers.<br/>
* Watching other unschoolers with their kids.<br/>
* Watching people who are good with kids, whether they&#39;re<br/>
unschoolers or not.<br/>
* Hearing jokes about unschooling.<br/>
* Hearing unschooling anecdotes.<br/>
* One sentence dropped in their ear at exactly the right <br/>
time.<br/>
* Listening to their kids.<br/>
* Birthing their babies at home.<br/>
* Attachment parenting.<br/>
* Having other people recognize the good things they&#39;re already<br/>
doing with their kids.<br/>
* Listening to their own internal wisdom.<br/>
* Having public school and then school-at-home blow up in their faces.<br/>
* Reading general parenting books.<br/>
* Applying their own personal values to their parenting.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between &quot;this is what you *could*<br/>
do&quot; and &quot;this is what you *should* do.&quot;  The first invites,<br/>
the second prescribes.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, invitation works so much better than<br/>
prescription.<br/>

<br/>
Please give me a definition of a definition you&#39;ve seen someone here give <br/>
that didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what in YOUR imagination we&#39;re discussing.<br/>
<br/>
After helping other homeschoolers for ten years, I find statements like &quot;use <br/>
your imagination&quot; to be insulting.<br/>
<br/>
How do you think we helped each other on Prodigy in 1982 or whenever it was?  <br/>
How do you think we helped each other on the AOL forum?  How do you think <br/>
people help each other at support groups and conventions?  How do HEM <br/>
articles help people?  How did Growing Without Schooling help people?<br/>
<br/>
By telling stories.  By showing something someone found (I LOVED the Kathy <br/>
Creech essays in GWS), and relating thoughts and conversations.  By showing <br/>
them what has worked, and what has failed.<br/>
<br/>
When a person reads about, or meets, one unschooling family, she sees the <br/>
differences.  When she knows more families, reads  more accounts, gets <br/>
various answers to questions, the picture of the possibilities broadens and <br/>
deepens.<br/>
<br/>
When one person comes up claiming to be an unschooler and explaining how she <br/>
gets her kids to finish math workbooks, it is not unreasonable for other <br/>
actual unschoolers to suggest that that is not a path to unschooling, but <br/>
away from it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s a huge difference between &quot;this is what you *could*<br/>
do&quot; and &quot;this is what you *should* do.&quot;  The first invites,<br/>
the second prescribes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They COULD put their kids back in school.  There is also &quot;What you might want <br/>
to avoid.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me the idea of having a &quot;set of priorities&quot; has really put the icing on the cake.  When Sandra explained that for her type of unschooling [you can debate whether there are other types]learning is a priority, I knew I could adopt this philosophy and never worry about unschooling again.  Homes where learning is not a priority will unschool differently than homes where it is.  I think it is these priorities that change the look of unschooling from family to family.<br/>
<br/>
The concern over being a coersive parent could be eliminated when there are defined family values or priorities.  High on my family&#39;s list of priorities or values would be, spending time together as a family, immediate as well as extended; a love of learning; kindness and consideration to others; honesty and integrity; and good manners ie. please, thank you, eating with mouth closed, etc.  Discussions of these values would be common and weight along these areas would be given when making decisions cooperatively.  *IMHO* those that feel that is it too coersive to express family values openly fall more in line with the philosophy of &quot;Non-Coersive Parenting&quot; than &quot;Unschooling&quot;. <br/>

&gt; that don&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the defining of unschooling is such a minor player in what goes on<br/>
at Unschooling.com, the email list and here that it really isn&#39;t worth<br/>
worrying over. At least not here. If you&#39;re talking about the world out<br/>
there where unschooling is undefined, I don&#39;t see anything productive that<br/>
can come of discussing it since there isn&#39;t any one influence that&#39;s causing<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally newbies come in to the message boards and want a quick answer<br/>
to what unschooling is and it does get defined -- generally in a variety of<br/>
ways. But they&#39;re told the best way to understand unschooling is to read the<br/>
message board. The message board is full of personal stories, discussion,<br/>
days in the life.  All the things you say you&#39;d rather see.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think, though,<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;d rather see unschooling unfold naturally in people&#39;s lives,<br/>
&gt; even if it takes longer, than emerge from a struggle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the idea is pretty. I think if unschooling were for each individual,<br/>
like enlightenment, then they could spend a lifetime working at it.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if everyone had a neighbor who radiated patience and glorious<br/>
free kids, that people could come to unschooling naturally. They could see a<br/>
living example of something valuable that could counteract the message that<br/>
the only road worth travelling is the road to success.<br/>
<br/>
But people don&#39;t. Most are surrounded by a school mindset on the fast track<br/>
to success.<br/>
<br/>
Theories are good. But testing them out in practice is even better. Why<br/>
don&#39;t you get onto the Unschooling.com message board and put some of your<br/>
theories into practice with the newbies? There are some nurturing hand<br/>
holders there :-) (AnneO comes to mind.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The natural learning potential of human children is truly amazing.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t imagine how a parent could watch that and not step<br/>
&gt; back, awed and humbled by how well it works.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Get a hit of that, and everything else follows naturally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they do. In droves. Most parents are right there from the beginning,<br/>
watching their kids absorb life. But there&#39;s just too much certainty around<br/>
them that that is a sweet, innocent time, but it&#39;s not enough for the<br/>
future. I&#39;ve heard far too many reports of people flabbergasted that some<br/>
kids aren&#39;t in preschool. (&quot;They&#39;ll be handicapped in school if they don&#39;t<br/>
get a head start!&quot; (Behind already at 3.)) And parents believe that message<br/>
over the messages that say it&#39;s okay to slow down. But it&#39;s just too scary<br/>
to slow down. Their kids&#39; lives are at stake.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you&#39;re envisioning isn&#39;t unschooling. I think it&#39;s something<br/>
good, encouraging people to tune out the noise and listen to their hearts.<br/>
But how far from their comfort zones would their hearts allow them to go<br/>
without a model that&#39;s way past their comfort zone?<br/>
<br/>
Do we all need to be radical feminists to find a free and happy life? No. We<br/>
can (to some extent) unfold naturally to be who we are. But how far could we<br/>
unfold if the radical feminists hadn&#39;t pushed the envelope as far as they<br/>
did? If there hadn&#39;t been people saying &quot;That&#39;s not respectful!&quot; our vision<br/>
of respectful would still be men taking care of women.<br/>
<br/>
I think you underestimate the capacity of society to create rules, and the<br/>
capacity of people to like rules to follow. Unless there&#39;s a radical element<br/>
that keeps reminding people that those rules aren&#39;t necessary, people tend<br/>
to be drawn to rules rather than doing what they think is best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354937339">I don&#39;t think that learning occurs optimally when there are <br/>
artificially segregated age groups that are assumed to learn one best <br/>
way. I am such a &quot;radical unschooler&quot; that I don&#39;t separate adults <br/>
out as &quot;schoolish learners&quot; and children as &quot;unschooling learners&quot;. <br/>
My definition of unschooling incorporates learning all the time, not <br/>
just while one is young. I believe you CAN teach old dogs new tricks. <br/>
<br/>
It is a more tedious and complex process to unlearn old ways which no <br/>
longer are useful. My counselor encouraged me that &#39;anything that can <br/>
be learned, can be unlearned&#39;. I learned not to trust in childhood, I <br/>
am unlearning this by embracing collaborative learning and <br/>
collaborative problem solving. I am seeing that it is a more useful <br/>
skill for my son to learn this way and am incorporating it into all <br/>
of my relationships too. It has been much more useful in the past to <br/>
stake out an area of expertise such as critical care nursing. But now <br/>
I am seeing a bigger picture of my caregiving role which incorporates <br/>
nurturing beyond patients and children.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t restrict &quot;unschooling&quot; to a way of learning new concepts, <br/>
unschooling to me is a way of learning life. The most important life <br/>
skills to me are trust, self-determination, non-coercion. While my <br/>
son practices these life skills, other subjects and concepts have a <br/>
foundation upon which to build.<br/>

 <br/>
For many people homeschooling and unschooling ARE the same. Helen Hegener  <br/>
seems to believe so, anyway! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Legally we homeschool; philosophically, we unschool.  We live our  lives as <br/>
if school didn&#39;t exist. We don&#39;t recreate school at home. We don&#39;t do  anything <br/>
that remotely resembles school. We believe that we&#39;re all learning all  the <br/>
time.<br/>
 <br/>
There are many homeSCHOOLers who do just that----a little  &quot;school-at-home&quot; <br/>
complete with bells and recess. There are many  homeschoolers who put together <br/>
unit studies, or who are &quot;relaxed&quot;, but  still require some amount of reading <br/>
and math each day. There are some that use  the bible as the only &quot;text&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
All creationists (bible as text) are homeschoolers, but not all  <br/>
homeschoolers are creationists. All eclectics are homeschoolers, but not all  <br/>
homeschoolers are eclectics. All unit studiers are homeschoolers, but not all  <br/>
homeschoolers are unit studiers.  <br/>
 <br/>
All unschoolers are legally homeschoolers, but NO homeSCHOOLers are  <br/>
unschoolers. You can&#39;t do both----school-at-home and Unschool.<br/>
 <br/>
Many people seem to want to jump on the unschooling bandwagon because we  <br/>
simply have more fun! &lt;g&gt; Or they like the title. But I think that *they*  just <br/>
haven&#39;t spent much time thinking about unschooling or reading John Holt or  <br/>
talking with other unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
Simply, it is NOT &quot;doing&quot; school, but many of us (and probably ALL of us on  <br/>
*this* list) take it a bit further and apply the philosophy to the rest of  <br/>
our lives.  That&#39;s what makes *this* list so special---we&#39;re a &quot;tribe&quot; of  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795750852">Yes, I stand corrected. Learning is an active process. One can not <br/>
teach unschooling anymore than one can teach life. One can model <br/>
living life and model living unschooling. Everyone has their own <br/>
definition of life and unschooling. Perhaps I am wrong and there is <br/>
only one absolute way to unschool. Then we would need a teacher. lol <br/>
But I don&#39;t think this contradiction is true.<br/>
<br/>
One can guide, facilitate, nurture and perhaps become a trusted <br/>
advisor, but one can not assume that their way to teach life or <br/>
unschooling is the only way that unschooling can or should be <br/>
modeled. Limiting other&#39;s paths of unschooling obstructs people from <br/>
choosing what one wants or needs to learn about unschooling. Just as <br/>
limiting access to TV interferes with one learning personal <br/>
discretion, limiting another&#39;s opinion of unschooling limits learning <br/>
how to live unschooling. The locus of control continues to reside <br/>
with the teacher rather than with the student, no differently than at <br/>
school. Unless one is going to the school of unschooling. lol<br/>
<br/>
One does not have to choose to facilitate in an optimal way. But <br/>
isn&#39;t it the student who must decide what is optimal for himself, <br/>
rather than the teacher? Isn&#39;t that the point of unschooling? But one <br/>
can choose not to facilitate also. But then what a loss for <br/>
both &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot;. Perhaps purging ourselves of these <br/>
constructs of teacher and student is truly the key to unschooling and <br/>
lifelong learning.<br/>

Interesting twist on this.<br/>
My best friends have been involved in a Sudbury Valley School in CT. For the <br/>
last year they&#39;ve been struggling, but something happened this year, and they <br/>
will be opening with a bunch of kids.<br/>
<br/>
The neat thing they are finding is that this year the people visiting (and <br/>
many signing up) seem to GET IT more. In their information nights, when people <br/>
question, other visitors are popping up and talking about Trusting kids, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool.<br/>

<br/>
I think I see the point you&#39;re trying to make but I don&#39;t think your examples <br/>
are legitimate.<br/>
<br/>
Not having TV at all would be not like having books at all.<br/>
<br/>
Having it doesn&#39;t mean reading ALL of it, or watching ALL of it.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s access to a form of information.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wanting to learn more about unschooling has the entire world to learn <br/>
from.  <br/>
Nobody is limited to the internet, or just to books, or just to magazine <br/>
articles, or just a support group or just conferences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-One can guide, facilitate, nurture and perhaps become a trusted <br/>
<br/>
advisor, but one can not assume that their way to teach life or <br/>
<br/>
unschooling is the only way that unschooling can or should be <br/>
<br/>
modeled. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you have personal preferences and beliefs and you have a support group <br/>
that meets in your house, you can enforce your own beliefs to some extent, as the <br/>
owner of the home, and the organizer of the group.   Nobody would have to go <br/>
to your house or your group to become an unschooler, though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The locus of control continues to reside <br/>
<br/>
with the teacher rather than with the student, no differently than at <br/>
<br/>
school. Unless one is going to the school of unschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;think?<br/>
Where is this school?<br/>
Do people have to go and get a paper at the end of many years before they can <br/>
unschool?<br/>
Is anyone forced to go?  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The locus of control&quot;??<br/>
Who is controlling whether anyone unschools?<br/>
Who is controlling where or how they do it?<br/>
<br/>
In school, control is real.  Where you sit, when you arrive, when you can <br/>
leave, the format of your assignments, dates of tests, all that is control.<br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;no differently than school&quot; have to do with learning about <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-One does not have to choose to facilitate in an optimal way. But <br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t it the student who must decide what is optimal for himself, <br/>
<br/>
rather than the teacher? -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-One does not have to choose to facilitate in an optimal way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm.... <br/>
&quot;Facilitate&quot; means to make something easier for someone.<br/>
Would someone choose to do something in a way that seemed to have no <br/>
advantages?<br/>
<br/>
Will one set of advantages serve for all?<br/>
Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone bound or required to learn unschooling from any certain source?<br/>
Not that I&#39;ve ever heard.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone forced to share or provide information about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Phaps purging ourselves of these <br/>
<br/>
constructs of teacher and student is truly the ke<br/>
Zy to unschooling and <br/>
<br/>
lifelong learning.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I want to learn macrame, I&#39;ll get a book and probably find someone who can <br/>
do it so I can watch and ask questions.  If I first purge myself of the idea <br/>
that there are people who know more about macrame than I do, it will be harder <br/>
for me to move on to learning on my own.  <br/>
<br/>
First I need to see some examples and get some advice.   Then I might move on <br/>
to creating some things nobody&#39;s ever thought of.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might be able to look at some strings tied around a glass float <br/>
or a bottle and know how to make fishing nets and to cover all the railings on <br/>
their deck.  I&#39;d need some help to get started, personally.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are as many ways of tying knots as there are knot-tyers.  <br/>
 Some knots work really well for particular purposes, and have been passed <br/>
down for thousands of years.  If it makes the difference between my boat or my <br/>
horse still being there when I get back, I&#39;m willing to let someone show me a <br/>
really good way to tie that rope.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One can not <br/>
<br/>
teach unschooling anymore than one can teach life. One can model <br/>
<br/>
living life and model living unschooling. Everyone has their own <br/>
<br/>
definition of life and unschooling. Perhaps I am wrong and there is <br/>
<br/>
only one absolute way to unschool. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s no one way to do it doesn&#39;t mean there are an infinite <br/>
number or ways.<br/>
Just because there&#39;s more than one right way doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t some <br/>
wrong ways.<br/>
Just because there are hundreds of breeds of dogs doesn&#39;t mean every animal <br/>
is a dog.<br/>
<br/>
There are some relaxed homeschoolers and eclectic homeschoolers who aren&#39;t <br/>
using a curriculum, but they sure as hell aren&#39;t unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312026348">A friend recommended a book to me called _The Alphabet and the Goddess_, <br/>
about how written language may have had a strong influence on how people <br/>
think.  (I haven&#39;t read it yet, but I&#39;m planning to pick up a copy.)<br/>
<br/>
I had some thoughts this week about how books and school change us over <br/>
from learning from experience, to learning from someone else&#39;s <br/>
experience put down on paper.  (Before that I suppose common knowledge <br/>
was passed in songs and poems as well as being demonstrated.)  When most <br/>
experience came from learning, it makes sense that elders would be <br/>
considered the wisest people in the tribe, as they would likely have had <br/>
the most experiences to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
Underneath this all, I think I&#39;m chewing on the idea that adults often <br/>
can&#39;t pass their own experiences to their teenagers, meaningfully, via <br/>
lectures.  (About safe driving, or not taking drugs, using birth <br/>
control.)  This is a truism that I&#39;ve come across anecdotally and in <br/>
novels.  It makes me wonder whether &quot;learning&quot; from hearing someone <br/>
else&#39;s story is always a shallow kind of learning, or whether there is a <br/>
stage in life where learning from hearing other people yap about <br/>
something is especially ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, when we urge new people to meet real unschoolers and come to <br/>
unschooling conferences, we are promoting getting closer to experiencing <br/>
unschooling and getting away from lecturing people about it.  Also, <br/>
saying &quot;just do it&quot; is a nudge in the direction on experiential learning.<br/>

That doesn&#39;t make sense to me, and it&#39;s not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
