<div id="ygrps-yiv-969946734">Hello,<br/>
I lurk on this list because isn&#39;t easy for me to express myself in english but you help me a lot frecuently.<br/>
A homeschooling dad from Spain is asking help. His 6 y/o son likes computer a lot. He wants to teach the kid pc programming and is looking for something simple. <br/>
<br/>
I invite Spanish language unschoolers to this list: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.msn.com/aprendizajenatural/">http://groups.msn.com/aprendizajenatural/</a> <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your support.<br/>
