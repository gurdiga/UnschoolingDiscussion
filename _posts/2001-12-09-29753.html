<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849677483">They are wooden rode (you can get plastic, but I much prefer wood) that<br/>
come in 10 sizes, each size being a different color. The white rod<br/>
(&quot;one&quot;) is one square centimeter, the red rod (&quot;two&quot;) is 1x1x2, or equal<br/>
to two ones next to each other... and so on, all the way through 10. John<br/>
Holt wrote about them some, but basically they&#39;re just a nice, easy way<br/>
to make somewhat abstract concepts about numbers concrete. Also, if you<br/>
have enough, you can build dandy Egyptian tombs, playgrounds, amusement<br/>
parks, playmobil furniture, and so on... The Miquon math program (which I<br/>
think is so cool but Cacie has no interest in) uses them, too..<br/>

&gt; &gt; So I say, go ahead and<br/>
&gt; &gt; buy some stuff (I like Cuisenaire rods, too), but for goodness��� <br/>
&gt; sake let<br/>
&gt; &gt; your kids play with it ON THEIR OWN.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Can you explain how these work? I haven&#39;t even seen them just <br/>
&gt; heard of <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

cube, the 10s are a rod 10 small cubes in length, the 100s are plates<br/>
(squares) that are 10 X 10 and the thousand is ten of the plates (and<br/>
another cube).  Right now my kids play with them, make sculptures with<br/>
them, etc.  It&#39;s a great way to learn about magnitude and place value.<br/>
And they are decent building toys too!  If you have small children who<br/>
like to put things in ther mouths, the ones might be a choking hazard.<br/>
