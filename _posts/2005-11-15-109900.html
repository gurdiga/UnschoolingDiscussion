<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536801272">MSNBC&#39;s Coast to Coast had a piece on the pros and cons of<br/>
homeschooling    since the kid who murdered his girlfriend&#39;s parents<br/>
was homeschooled and so was she. They also identified themselves as<br/>
Christians on their websites.<br/>
The one good thing was the promotion of the Family Unschoolers Network<br/>
and Unschooling.org. The idiot they found to list the cons was hilarious. <br/>
<br/>
Take the &#39;is homeschooling better than public schooling survey&#39; at  MSNBC:<br/>

<br/>
The numbers are pretty pathetic now showing 60% believe public<br/>
schooling is better than homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333084720">It&#39;s 53% that think homeschooling is better than public schooling <br/>
now. With 36% thinking it&#39;s worse.<br/>
<br/>
 S&#39;funny as what you call private schools are called public schools <br/>
here and what you call public schools are called state schools here. <br/>
So if any Brit says they went to public school they mean one that <br/>
was fee paying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well that number would&#39;ve probably been more like 90% ten years ago so it&#39;s <br/>
not so bad.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of dangerous to go to school (shooting-wise) but more dangerous to <br/>
be a Christian homeschooler in the southern U.S., it seems, statistically.   <br/>
Safest:   Unschooling. &lt;g&gt;   (As far as I know...)<br/>
