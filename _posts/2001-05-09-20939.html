<br/>
Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
My name is April Spitzer, my daughters are 5 and 3yr old.  We are currently stationed with the Army at Ft. Drum, NY.  We have lived in Hanau, Germany, where these focus groups originated.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am very concerned that the military will decide on more strict guidelines and standardized tests OCONUS.  Anytime the military seeks to change anything, more rules are usually applied.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what sort of input you are looking for- but I would hope anybody connected with this study will push for no standardized testing, no certification requirements for the parents of homeschooled children, and very little monitoring.<br/>
 <br/>
I also realize that the military will want some sort of accountability, so I would be willing to suggest that parents turn in a yearly report on their activities and attendance.<br/>
 <br/>
It has also been my experience with the Hanau (or any installation&#39;s) Army Community Support, that they look for any reason to monitor families.  Whether the child fell down, isn&#39;t gaining enough weight or they were left alone him for 2 minutes while the mother went to the basement to fetch the laundry.  I&#39;m very concerned about increased monitoring of families, and decreased freedom for US families stationed overseas.  It is difficult enough being a military family without constant intrusion by the military itself.<br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
April Spitzer<br/>
