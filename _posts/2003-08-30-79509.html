I couldn&#39;t believe what I typed! I didn&#39;t mean hsers weren&#39;t doing &quot;anything!&quot; I meant they weren&#39;t attending activities outside the home during school hours. LOL. Guess it was a Freudian slip or something! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

I figured, but it was fun and funny!  Because they so often say unschoolers <br/>
aren&#39;t doing anything no matter HOW much we do while they&#39;re sitting filling in <br/>
the blanks and writing practice-reports.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
