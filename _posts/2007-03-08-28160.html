<br/>
Were you allowed, at 6, to play with a lighter without anyone with you?<br/>
Do you think a rule that says NO will keep a child safe?<br/>
<br/>
Kids play with fire because they&#39;re curious.  If their curiosity is  <br/>
safely satisfied, they&#39;ll have no need to be sneaky.  If you&#39;re right  <br/>
there talking about safety and space and what&#39;s too near and what&#39;s  <br/>
flammable, you&#39;ll make her safe.  &quot;Just say no&quot; rules do not equal  <br/>
safe; they equal sneaky.<br/>

<br/>
The effect of those questions in that order is to make it seem   <br/>
you&#39;ve already decided and you want us to back you up.  It also seems  <br/>
you&#39;ve seen the edges but not the middle.  I recommend this article:   <br/>

<br/>
Taking the questions separately,<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-Should I just let her<br/>
light a bunch of candles and be there with her until the need wears<br/>
off?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The need will not &quot;wear off,&quot; it will be satisfied.  &quot;The need&quot; is  <br/>
the need to learn.  You should hope it never wears off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- go and buy her a bunch of candles so we can light them etc? -=-<br/>
<br/>
At a thrift store you could get some candles, probably several  <br/>
assorted in a plastic bag for $3.  That&#39;s pretty inexpensive for a  <br/>
memorable half hour of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-spill wax everywhere?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think wax would be spilled everywhere?  That doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
sense.  Find a cookie sheet or baking tray and put aluminum foil in  <br/>
it and use that, or play outside on concrete, or on a patio or deck.   <br/>
Set up by the fireplace, and drip the wax on firewood if wax is going  <br/>
to have to drip.  Or set the candles in pie pans.<br/>
<br/>
Birthday candles are very inexpensive.    You could stick them in  <br/>
Play-Doh or modelling clay.  Make a &quot;cake&quot; out of something like  <br/>
that, or a mudpie cake.  Wax dripping on mud isn&#39;t going to hurt  <br/>
anything.  Play-Doh&#39;s cheap.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -=-or do I say &quot;My job is to keep you safe&quot; type<br/>
thing?-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that your only other choice?<br/>
Your job IS to keep her safe, but not by depriving her of  <br/>
opportunities.  By providing safe opportunities.<br/>

Find something metal.<br/>
<br/>
Put a bowl of water near, so she can stick her fingers in that if she  <br/>
needs to.  Dripping wax into a bowl of water is VERY cool, though.   <br/>
Maybe a metal pie pan with water.  Try dripping wax into baby  <br/>
powder.  I made my boyfriend a little hanging sculpture with the wax  <br/>
beads I made by dripping wax in powder long ago.  You can string them  <br/>
with needle and thread if you do it while they&#39;re still a little warm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41737324">wow... Sandra, I like your replies and your posts.  You are quite a  <br/>
challenge sometimes.   In a medium like this it is very hard to  <br/>
express everything the way I could in a RL situation.  But here in  <br/>
flat black and white emails that cannot always be.  I am far from  <br/>
being the &quot;unschooling mom of the year&quot;, but, as I have stated before  <br/>
I am re-connecting and through this group and much of your writings  <br/>
and Joyce&#39;s as well, I am making progress.  Sometimes when you are in  <br/>
the process, questions come up as to how to handle specific  <br/>
situations.  In my current evolution I am afraid of my kids playing  <br/>
with lighters and lighting candles when I&#39;m not around.  Part of  <br/>
progressing is also being honest with what your feeling.   Based on  <br/>
this fear (them getting burned), and knowing that Athena still feels  <br/>
the need (I agree that &quot;the type&quot;is a not cool way to talk about my  <br/>
child and I thank you for that &quot;heads up&quot; ) to sneak behind my back  <br/>
(another behavior that is quickly disappearing) I came to this group  <br/>
to ask some basic questions.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for unschooling in action, so to speak, and ideas about  <br/>
how other unschooling parents have handled the fire thing.  Is there  <br/>
a boundary line?  She (Athena) is also very independent and wants to  <br/>
do/try things without me around.  She is already very comfortable  <br/>
with fire and lighting candles and helping with the wood stove and  <br/>
roasting sausages on our open fire pit outside.  When I talk about  <br/>
safety, and distance, and flammable etc she says she already knows.   <br/>
When they were 5 we were outside lighting small grass fires and  <br/>
putting them out with blankets, water and smothering them with dirt  <br/>
and I let them use the small fire extinguisher.  So in a very real  <br/>
sense they do understand about fire.  I am looking for approaches  <br/>
that work.  I understand the concepts  but still have a hard time  <br/>
implementing them in certain areas.<br/>
<br/>
I also wasn&#39;t asking for your approval.  Again, looking for ideas and  <br/>
suggestion.  It is true that as I re-learn and re-connect I analyze  <br/>
and think more about how to react to something, trying to see if it  <br/>
is knee-jerk or calculated, or if there is manipulation behind what I  <br/>
want to say, or coerciveness or guilt.  These are often hard to  <br/>
recognize, and since fire is a safety issue I want to make the best  <br/>
decision possible.<br/>
<br/>
As far as dripping wax everywhere... Obviously you haven&#39;t seen my  <br/>
house and how very lax I am about things like that.  I do not live in  <br/>
or keep one of those neat and tidy homes nor do I have furniture I  <br/>
care about.  My apologies for not clarifying that I meant&quot;dripping  <br/>
wax everywhere&quot; as a fun thing to do... not necessarily all over the  <br/>
furniture, but onto plates and trays and into water (great idea).<br/>
<br/>
You have strong convictions based on real life experience.  People  <br/>
with strong convictions can come off as being hard.  I don&#39;t mind  <br/>
being the learner here.  At first glance your email came off as  <br/>
unnecessarily harsh.  Perhaps it is, perhaps not.  It doesn&#39;t really  <br/>
matter.  Personally I was never very good at diplomacy and much  <br/>
prefer someone&#39;s true thoughts unpampered and not sugar-coated, as  <br/>
yours are.<br/>
<br/>
Your second reply was more along the lines of what  I was looking for  <br/>
and I will re-read your balance article.  Thanks for the suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
About finding a metal lid for the wax to drip into... wouldn&#39;t it be  <br/>
cool to watch the plastic lid turn black and warp from the heat of  <br/>
the candle flame?<br/>

<br/>
If you talk about it conversationally, as you would with an adult  <br/>
friend or a teen, you&#39;ll find out what she knows without telling her  <br/>
again what she knows.  So instead of talking about safety and  <br/>
distance, ask her to help you set up a safe area.  She&#39;ll tell you  <br/>
what she&#39;s doing and why, and you can point out what might burn or  <br/>
not.  (Plastic isn&#39;t the best thing for hot wax, I think; I would&#39;ve  <br/>
said, had I been there, &quot;Let&#39;s use metal.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also wasn&#39;t asking for your approval. Again, looking for ideas -=-<br/>
<br/>
This whole list is for discussing ideas, not for approvals.  And when  <br/>
I write to this list, I&#39;m writing to hundreds of people, not to one.   <br/>
There are people who have never posted a word who read every day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As far as dripping wax everywhere... Obviously you haven&#39;t seen my<br/>
house and how very lax I am about things like that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to have seen anyone&#39;s house to see the fallacy in the  <br/>
idea that either you let her drip wax everywhere or you forbid the  <br/>
activity altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when parents tent toward control it spills over in wanting  <br/>
to control things like how I respond to posts.  This list is a great  <br/>
place to get unschooling-in-action feedback.  And many years of &quot;best  <br/>
of&quot; is collected here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a> and at http:// <br/>
joyfullyrejoycing.com/ and other pages linked from those two.<br/>
<br/>
-=-About finding a metal lid for the wax to drip into... wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>

<br/>
Not inside the house, because it would stink badly, possibly cause  <br/>
toxic fumes, and if plastic melted on furniture, or the counter, or  <br/>
your child, that would be WAY, way worse than paraffin or bee&#39;s wax  <br/>
either one.   If you&#39;re concerned about safety, a plastic lid works  <br/>
against the stated principle.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At first glance your email came off as  unnecessarily harsh.  <br/>
Perhaps it is, perhaps not. It doesn&#39;t really  matter.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right.  It doesn&#39;t matter.  It was freely offered for the good  <br/>
of the future of unschooling at your house, freely given by someone  <br/>
whose children have played with fire for years and never been burned,  <br/>
by a mom who still plays with fire, married to a man who chopped  <br/>
firewood yesterday for an hour for a wood-burning hot tub and a  <br/>
fireplace.   We had a candlelit discussion here a few weeks back and  <br/>
holly spent a couple of hours, another night, with another teenager  <br/>
playing with the candle stubs making patterns in metal trays with all  <br/>
the drippings from that evening.<br/>
<br/>
If something I write doesn&#39;t appeal to one person, it&#39;s sure to be  <br/>
useful to two or three others.  There are 1361 members, according to  <br/>
yahoogroups today. Probably half of them forgot they&#39;re on the list.   <br/>
That still leaves a few to read and consider whatever comes through,  <br/>
in light of making their own children happier.  I&#39;m satisfied with  <br/>
the value and usefulness of the list.<br/>
<br/>
There are other lists linked here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
The only other one I&#39;m on is UnschoolingDiscussion, so if anyone  <br/>
wants to get away from my tone or confidence, there are other places  <br/>
to go where other unschoolers will probably say the same kinds of  <br/>
things (if you&#39;re lucky).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707354338">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; OK... right at this very moment Athena  has lit a candle.  For the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; past  2 days she has this thing with holding lit candles and dripping<br/>
&gt; the wax into a plastic lid, touching the wick and the and hot wax. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jayn (7) loves candle play, and always wants to push toothpicks into the wet <br/>
wax pool and watch them catch and burn. She also likes carving into pillar <br/>
candles. She puts them out with a snuffer, blowing or putting a small plate <br/>
over the flame and then I light it again for her using a good sized butane <br/>
safety lighter - the wand kind that is designed for barbeques. We also have <br/>
a very cool  hinged one that can be bent over to light candles at the bottom <br/>
of a container without burning one&#39;s hand.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is ensure that the candle is on a safe and solid surface, and one <br/>
that would be undamaged by the few wax drips. Jayn is interested in the <br/>
effect of thick wax on fabric. If Jayn is going overboard, IMO, with the <br/>
number of toothpicks I warn her that she is likely to melt the side of the <br/>
candle. Periodically during the game I clean out the black charcoal bits - <br/>
another tool for art work.<br/>
<br/>
Since our lighters are too difficult for her work yet, she still needs me to <br/>
do the lighting for her. That very simple method ensures that I am around <br/>
for all of this play. I have also told her I prefer to be there and so far <br/>
she hasn&#39;t objected. Actually she wants me there to be an audience for her <br/>
narrative about the game. I stay near sitting at the table with my computer <br/>
but don&#39;t &quot;hover&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Usually she doesn&#39;t think of doing it unless I have lit a candle for another <br/>
reason such as the table centerpiece. Jayn likes to decorate the dinner <br/>
table by theme, and these have been great occasions to talk about <br/>
flammability and why we should not have the Barbie sleeve or the floral <br/>
blooms hanging over the flame.<br/>
<br/>
We do have matches in the house too. Jayn has asked to light her own matches <br/>
at times, and what I did was ask her to do it in the bathroom where all the <br/>
surfaces are hard.  She knows how to do it properly away from her but I <br/>
think having to do that herself was too much trouble because she swiftly <br/>
went back to asking me to light her candles for her. She has also dripped <br/>
wax from tapers and used a burning candle to light incense sticks.<br/>
<br/>
I have ceased feeling the need to be present while she plays with her <br/>
incense sticks, partly because being too close to the smoke makes my eyes <br/>
sore. They tend to go out pretty quickly if she is waving them about and <br/>
making smoke patterns. She has used them to burn holes and lines in paper <br/>
for art work. Again this is something I ask her to do in the relative safety <br/>
of the bathroom just down the hall. The sticks we have just don&#39;t seem to <br/>
have the oomph to actually do more than make the paper smoulder and she <br/>
doesn&#39;t leave it unattended. So far she has informed me when she wants to <br/>
play (I light her candle) and then tells me when she is done and I attend to <br/>
trimming the candle wick if needed and put it away.<br/>
<br/>
She recently experimented with pieces of wire held to the flame by a damp <br/>
paper towel. Insulation.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn at 3 was very slightly burnt by a birthday cake candle. It was so <br/>
slight that she didn&#39;t even tell me about it, but just was wary around cakes <br/>
for a while. I didn&#39;t see it happen, but my friend on the other side of the <br/>
table did see it and finally told me about a year later when I mentioned <br/>
that Jayn didn&#39;t like candles - &quot;Oh it&#39;s because she was burnt&quot;. HUh??? Oh <br/>
well she got over it, and there was no visible burn so I think she might <br/>
just have felt the heat rather than actually gotten in to the flame. We just <br/>
supported her preference not to have candles on her cakes for a year or two <br/>
and the fear faded.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lovely moment in &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service&quot; when Kiki (13) builds <br/>
and lights the fire in the wall oven at the old lady&#39;s house. She says she <br/>
used to help her mother light fires all the time. Knowledge is a much better <br/>
safeguard than rules and denial. and the expectation of obedience.<br/>

Probably, but not as safe. I&#39;ve dropped melted plastic before and it hurts alot more than a little melted wax does. it also takes much longer to cool, therefore it can burn more.<br/>

very boring and worthless as far as any kind of evolution is  <br/>

<br/>
Asking her to help set up a safe fire place is a great suggestion.    <br/>
Too much talking... or telling i.e. teaching... will only make her  <br/>
defiant and defensive.  This is the point in the process that I have  <br/>
not yet utilized.  First is recognition that what I was doing wasn&#39;t  <br/>
working, then a study of my reactions and parenting ways, and then  <br/>
making steps toward what I want (stop yelling, back off, say yes,  <br/>
etc), and then there are fuzzy areas that I haven&#39;t been able to see  <br/>
clearly.. like this fire example.  Asking her to help set up the safe  <br/>
place is a way to keep moving forward.  Thank you.  Maybe next time  <br/>
I&#39;ll think to use the same approach on whatever comes along.  That  <br/>
would be evidence of further progress.<br/>

Sam built his first fire from start to finish in the fireplace the other <br/>
day. He&#39;s lit many fires outside and candles and helped to build the <br/>
fire, but this was &quot;his&quot; fire, and he was pretty damned proud. <br/>
Understandably so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379834569">When my children were very small they were just never alone, I was there for<br/>
every contact with flame and heat so maybe it was a natural progression.  I<br/>
would tell them &quot;hot&quot; and even reach out to touch, the make a face showing<br/>
pain but never told them &quot;no&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t touch&quot;.  Both eventually touched the<br/>
&quot;hot&quot; thing, I was right there with cold water and lots of comfort.  Both<br/>
children have been very careful with fire.<br/>
<br/>
I asked them to please have me with them if they want to play with candles<br/>
or matches, so far they always have.  They also show little interest in fire<br/>
and obvious respect for it&#39;s potential danger.  Perhaps it&#39;s because it was<br/>
never off limits and/or because I never lied to them.  I&#39;ve met several<br/>
people who say things like &quot;bite&quot; when referring to fire or stoves, they<br/>
don&#39;t &quot;bite&quot; and maybe that sets the ground work for lack of trust.<br/>

&gt;   OK... right at this very moment Athena has lit a candle. For the<br/>
&gt; past 2 days she has this thing with holding lit candles and dripping<br/>
&gt; the wax into a plastic lid, touching the wick and the and hot wax.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want her playing with it at all. If I&#39;m here, like right<br/>
&gt; this very second, I don&#39;t mind, but she is the type to go grab the<br/>
&gt; lighter and light it up when I&#39;m not here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to mess this up, so before I say anything I want to know<br/>
&gt; how you all have handled the fire situation. Should I just let her<br/>
&gt; light a bunch of candles and be there with her until the need wears<br/>
&gt; off? go and buy her a bunch of candles so we can light them etc?<br/>
&gt; spill wax everywhere? or do I say &quot;My job is to keep you safe&quot; type<br/>
&gt; thing?<br/>
