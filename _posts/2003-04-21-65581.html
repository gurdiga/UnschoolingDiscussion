<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123722141">WOW!!!  That is SO cool!  I&#39;ve always fancied the ride behind tent-like <br/>
carriers, but this is just WOW!  Having 3 little ones too small to ride <br/>
bikes, I may have to invest in one of these!  This way, two could ride in <br/>
the tent and watch the other kids ride their bikes while one can sit up <br/>
front for some special Mommy time.  Then we can take turns!  What an <br/>
exercise motivator. &gt;BG&lt;  It&#39;s so hard to get exercise with all the little <br/>
ones.  They hate being pinned up in a stroller, of course!, and a sling gets <br/>
really hot really FAST on a Texas walk, but this looks like so much FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the link, as I don&#39;t have the magazine, YET!<br/>
