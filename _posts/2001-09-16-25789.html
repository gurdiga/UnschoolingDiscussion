<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744259903">Hi,<br/>
  If someone finds comfort in sending bible quotes, I don&#39;t think they<br/>
should be censored.<br/>
  Even for the Atheist the bible can be of interest, because it is a<br/>
compiling of many ancient books. Just for some examples, Psalms is a book of<br/>
old songs and poems, Chronicles is a book of records, and Revelation<br/>
consists of many letters written in code by people imprisoned trying to send<br/>
a message.<br/>
The story about Jacob wrestling with his thigh all night, interests me,<br/>
because people used to believe that thinking took place in the thigh. The<br/>
quote, a camel trying to get through an eye of a needle could be<br/>
interoperated different, because in Arabic camel and rope are similar words.<br/>
 Whether one believes the bible to be literal facts or allegories, it is<br/>
history, literature, etc, and many of the ideas parallel other religions and<br/>
philosophies.<br/>
The bible, the constitution, unschooling  all offer concepts that are bigger<br/>
than the people who write about them.<br/>
 (Please note that I am not trying to exclude other important books, ideals,<br/>
etc., just trying to make a point if reference to what has been mentioned as<br/>
of late).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s another interesting read for you:<br/>
<br/>
In helping my Mom with her reserach, I went over to the Islamicity.com site <br/>
and was stunned by the description of Islam:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What is Islam ?<br/>
<br/>
Islam is not a new religion, but the same truth that God revealed through all <br/>
His prophets to every people. For a fifth of the world&#39;s population, Islam is <br/>
both a religion and a complete way of life. Muslims follow a religion of <br/>
peace, mercy, and forgiveness, and the majority have nothing to do with the <br/>
extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do Muslims believe?<br/>
<br/>
Muslims believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God; in the Angels created by <br/>
Him; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind; in <br/>
the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions; in God&#39;s <br/>
complete authority over human destiny and in life after death. Muslims <br/>
believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah, <br/>
Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, <br/>
Elias, Jonah, John the Baptist, and Jesus, peace be upon them. But God&#39;s <br/>
final message to man, a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a <br/>
summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad <br/>
through Gabriel.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
It amazed me how closely linked Islam and Christianity are.  I had NO idea.  <br/>
I had thought of Islam as an entirely separate and distinct set of beliefs -- <br/>
then I continued reading and found many similarities to my smattering of <br/>
information about Christian beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing to me anyway.  Mostly amazing that I could have gotten to the ripe <br/>
old age of 44 and not know anything about a huge religion!  <br/>
<br/>
It was good lesson to me in how we are not as different as we think we are.<br/>

<br/>
I knew that part.  They&#39;re also an offshoot of the Old Testament beliefs (in <br/>
Christian terms; sorry).<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t know until lately I learned reading part of the Koran, and some <br/>
introductory materials to it (in the Great Books edition).  There was a <br/>
particular Christian guy some of them were in contact with in days before <br/>
that was written, and what they had learned from and by him was vile, and <br/>
they judged all Christianity by one rude freak.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people judging all Moslems by a few rude freaks, perhaps, but if <br/>
you look in there you will see some BIGtime anti-Christian sentiment.  It&#39;s <br/>
not based on what Christianity looks like to anyone I have ever known personal<br/>
ly, but their official religious review of Christians is Not Good.<br/>
<br/>
And so if this turns into religious war, I&#39;m afraid that will be the image <br/>
they will be fighting to save themselves from, not the real people out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150214621">I believe that most of the list members were educated through the <br/>
public school system and this lack of knowledge about religions would <br/>
be one indication of why the public school system doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Most world history books include a rather concise detailed <br/>
description of how Mohammed became disallusioned by his Christian <br/>
religion (yes, he was a Christian) and made the decision to seperate <br/>
from the church and form his own religion.  He felt that Christianity <br/>
had gotten away from the true teaching of Christ and that a true <br/>
Christian would follow the directives that he set forth.<br/>
<br/>
All of the teachings are taken from the Christian relgions of that <br/>
time and are based on all the same principles.<br/>
<br/>
And, just like the Crusades and the Inquisitions and so forth and so <br/>
on, I never have been able to understand how something that is <br/>
founded in peace and goodwill can be so perverted by a certain <br/>
segment to do so much evil.<br/>

am just learning.  And, of course, you are right!<br/>
<br/>
BTW I went on the Islamicity.com discussion board with some really ignorant <br/>
questions, and they were extremely nice about answering everything.  In case <br/>
anyone had any questions.<br/>
