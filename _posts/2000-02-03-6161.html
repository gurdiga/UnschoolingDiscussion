<div id="ygrps-yiv-998105987">&lt;&lt; Lakeland - not too far from you!!  :)  It may interest you to know that <br/>
Polk county is considered the hillbilly section of Florida, which may account <br/>
for my classy sense of humor.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ROFL  I&#39;ve lived in FL since 1973 (in Tampa, then here since 1978) and I know <br/>
whereof you speak :)  We go up to Orlando every few weeks, it seems (just <br/>
last weekend we were there); maybe we can plan to stop by and see your new <br/>
toe ring the next time we&#39;re going that way!<br/>
<br/>
And count me in on the &quot;jewelry and culture&quot; thing - I love jewelry, but odd, <br/>
funky stuff...BTW, there&#39;s a great little shop in Old Town, in Kissimmee, <br/>
that has some great stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Linda in FL :)  (who&#39;s certain that no one else is even remotely interested <br/>
in this conversation, and will take the rest of it off the list ...although <br/>
sharing books with Betsey, jewelry & culture, and learning while in the <br/>
Orlando area are certainly a part of OUR unschooling adventure ROFL)</div>
