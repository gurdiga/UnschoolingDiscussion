<br/>
It  happens, eventually.  Honest.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest decided to start using a toilet two weeks before his 4th<br/>
birthday.  No accidents ever once he decided.<br/>
<br/>
The other two, I don&#39;t remember.  Younger with toilet training, older with<br/>
weaning.<br/>
<br/>
Weaning ages varied widely.  That eventually happens, too.<br/>

<br/>
Look around and though you will find adults who can&#39;t read, I doubt you&#39;ll be<br/>
able to find any adults who still nurse / drink from a bottle or wear nappies<br/>
(diapers). It&#39;ll happen. It is frustrating, and worrying, but it will happen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All encouraging news here.  Two children -- two completely different <br/>
timetables.  My son, born first, nursed for 5 weeks, went to a bottle and <br/>
then to a cup shortly after 1, was out of diapers by about 1 1/2.  I do <br/>
remember he was not in diapers when my daughter was born 18 months after him. <br/>
 My daughter -- a completely different story -- in so many ways and these are <br/>
just a couple of the ways she is different.  She nursed for 9 months.  Was in <br/>
diapers until she was a little over 4 yo.  She drank from her bottle until <br/>
she was about 4 too.  She still (at 5) wets the bed; my son never has.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have been THAT different of a mom to them.  They are just <br/>
definitely individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  Wishing you patience -- this can all be very trying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is important to not put diapers on a child to doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to wear them.  (Quelle horreur!)  Well, we had some poops and pees here<br/>
and there for a while (yes, we have some beautiful carpets) - no big <br/>
deal - I went to the toilet, Jean Luc did - and Claire does now.<br/>
There was no pressure or timeframe - just gentle suggestions and<br/>
respect.  Diapers are weird...  How would you like it to have poop <br/>
all squashed up in there?  Perhaps it may be really odd to go poop <br/>
*not* in the diaper - on the ground squatting - or in the toilet - <br/>
if you have never pooped or peed that way... <br/>
<br/>
Claire starting going to the toilet and pooping out of a diaper at some<br/>
point - I really don&#39;t remember when, it just came to be.  She hardly <br/>
ever had clothes on - and even now, she is naked often at home...I <br/>
think diapers interfere with a lot - not only peeing and pooping, but <br/>
feeling, sexuality, moving freely, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
As for breastfeeing, Claire, 3.5, is breastfeeding when feels sleepy at <br/>
night before we all head to bead and in the morning.<br/>
Sometimes she asks during the say, particularly if she is feeling tired.<br/>
I do try to breastfeed as when she wishes, like this afternoon, but<br/>
I am also up front and real with Claire in sharing my feelings with<br/>
Claire if I really don&#39;t feel like breastfeeding, but, for the<br/>
the most part, I am available to her when she wishes - - - always taking<br/>
into consideration Claire and that one moment she chooses to breastfee, <br/>
*no matter where we are*.  I consider her feelings and her wishes.  <br/>
There is a very special closeness. The frequency of breastfeeding comes <br/>
and goes - like a big spiral - looping back again.  Sometimes<br/>
more breastfeeding - sometimes less - sometimes none.  <br/>
<br/>
There is much importance in mother being available.  The very special <br/>
love that comes through longterm breastfeeding, shines through a <br/>
lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Very best wishes,<br/>

was closer to 3.5).  The younger one learned in a day when he<br/>
needed/wanted to (basically, my dh had the checkbook and I only had 4$<br/>

given the choice to either wait until the little boy I babysat for came<br/>
over and use on of his diapers or go to the second hand store and get some<br/>
undies.....he opted for the undies).  He rarely had an accident after<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
As for weaning, he still nurses avidly at nearly 4.5 and it is *very*<br/>
important to him.  Since nursing certainly contributed to his older<br/>
brother&#39;s ability to beat E. Coli 0157 at 5.5 (not only nursing at the<br/>
time, but have wonderful gut integrity due to long time nursing and a<br/>
strong immune system), I&#39;m in no hurry for him to wean if he isn&#39;t ready,<br/>
so I have no words of advice there.<br/>

<br/>
Boy do I have tons to say on both of these!  It is the very lucky child<br/>
who gets to breastfeed longer than our American norm.  They do wean. <br/>
They really do!  &quot;Mothering Your Breastfeeding Toddler&quot; is a helpful<br/>
book.  I wrote a bit more below about our nursing/weaning experience. <br/>
(Remember that long term breastfeeding has health benefits for mother<br/>
too)  Don&#39;t let unbelievers influence you to force your dd to wean before<br/>
she is ready!<br/>
<br/>
As for potty training (I so dislike that term), I&#39;m a failure there.  Ha<br/>
ha.  Both my dd used pull ups after age 4.  I&#39;ve tried bribing, ignoring<br/>
the issue, and things in between.  I have a hard time with poop/pee<br/>
outside of the bathroom.  Sorry, but it is my preference to NOT have it<br/>
on the carpet or the furniture.  That said, I strive to be matter of fact<br/>
and not make the kids feel *bad* when it does happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I think disposable super absorbent bottom covers are part of the problem<br/>
and would probably do it different if I could start over.  But...I do<br/>
believe that using the toilet is one of those things that all humans want<br/>
to master, eventually learning how it is done in their culture.  At<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wearsthebaby.com">http://www.wearsthebaby.com</a>  there is a discussion on this.  I will look<br/>
for the exact link and send it in.<br/>
<br/>
If you care to read on, following is a bit on our nursing/weaning.<br/>
I made first dd wean after the birthday.  Bribed her with a toy she<br/>
wanted if she&#39;d stop that day.  I still regret that method.  After one<br/>
day with the toy, she wanted to take it back and have milky again.  Whole<br/>
story of her nursing/weaning is long and contains aspects I&#39;m proud of<br/>
and those I regret.  Hopefully I learned something!  She wasn&#39;t using the<br/>
toilet reliably until around 4 as well, and only stopped night wetting<br/>
recently (just turned 7).<br/>
<br/>
2nd dd was 4 in August & nurses anywhere from zero to 6 times in 24<br/>
hours.  She is definitely *weaning*.  (Remember it is a process!!)  I am<br/>
determined to let her nurse until she is finished.  I could write pages<br/>
on this, I&#39;m sure.  It is hardest when I&#39;m around people who feel she is<br/>
too old to be nursing.  (Which is nearly everybody!)  But as I age I find<br/>
it easier to not mind so much what others think.  Ho Ho Ho.  She is not<br/>
100% on the toilet either.<br/>

would be able to:  The all do eventually wean.<br/>
<br/>
And my addendum for our experience:  It may not be at 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or<br/>
6, but they do eventually wean and you will look back on it fondly.  I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure my older son is weaned.  Never thought he&#39;d wean from me to<br/>
decaf coffee and chess with his father in the mornings;)  but he has;<br/>
however, he has said he might want to nurse again when the next baby<br/>
arrives since he doesn&#39;t need to nurse but &quot;nothing tastes quite as<br/>
wonderful&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But they do wean, although he and I had some frustrating times, especially<br/>
nursing during 3 pregnancies and tandeming for over 4 years, I&#39;m happy<br/>
that he was able to end it in his own time and without any struggles or<br/>
regrets.  Furthermore, we moved so naturally into a different parenting<br/>
dance (as opposed to the &quot;oh, here, let&#39;s nurse and see if that fixes it&quot;)<br/>
that I had no struggles either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-791624839">#1 dd trained 2 wks before her 3rd bday.  I had just gotten her this really <br/>
cute little mermaid costume and said why dont&#39; you try going potty on the <br/>
toilet before you try this on.  I never said you can&#39;t wear this costume if <br/>
youdont&#39; use the toilet, just kept repeating it a few times and she did.  It <br/>
worked because she was ready.  I had not really encouraged her much before <br/>
that alhtough I had two in diapers for almost two years at that point and was <br/>
tandem nursing. She weaned at over three, and would have gone much longer if <br/>
I hadn&#39;t done partial weaning during pregnancy and infancy of my second <br/>
child.  #2 boy trained at 4 yrs 2 months with often negative comments from <br/>
his father : (  probably made him delay even longer!  Both he and my dd were <br/>
what I would call completed toilet trained within a two week time frame, on <br/>
their own with very few accidents after that.  #2 son weaned at 2 yr 4 <br/>
months, which was 5 weeks before #3 was born.  Again I did some partial <br/>
weaning during pregnancy and was prepared to tandem nurse again.  He was no <br/>
longer interested.  He too would have nursed longer I am sure.  #3 son is 2 <br/>
yrs 9 months, absolutely no sign of using the toilet or weaning and no sign <br/>
of mommy getting pregnant before this child has outlived his need for <br/>
nursing!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648453232">My kids were all on the late side of potty-training.  Actually, not my <br/>
first one; he was 2 1/2 yrs old.  The others were all past 3.  The method <br/>
that worked pretty well for us was to take a day when we didn&#39;t have anywhere <br/>
else to go, have the house plenty warm, and put a long t-shirt on our child <br/>
without any diaper or anything else underneath.  They seem to feel a major <br/>
difference and don&#39;t feel comfortable just going with nothing there.  The <br/>
biggest trick is getting them to go the first time in the toilet.  When that <br/>
happened, they were excited and yes, we did kind of cheer (not totally <br/>
internal rewards, I know).  After that, they wanted to keep going.  We had <br/>
them spend the whole day with the long t-shirt (adult size) and it seemed <br/>
that by the next day, it was reinforced pretty well.  It works well to be <br/>
able to go as many days as possible before having to go somewhere.  When that <br/>
point finally comes, I think it&#39;s better to put on thin underwear so that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like a diaper.<br/>
     I guess this isn&#39;t a true unschooling approach but it was an approach <br/>
that waited until they were plenty old enough to understand and it didn&#39;t <br/>
involve getting mad at them or dragging it out for monthes with a lot of <br/>
accidents.  I have noticed that when that happens, the parents seem to get <br/>
mad whether they intend to or not because they get so tired of monthes of <br/>
accidents.  I also never forced it if a child said he didn&#39;t want to.  We <br/>
just stopped and tried it again a month or more later.  Anyway, I hope this <br/>
helps.  Whatever you decide to do, you know that sometime before their <br/>
adulthood, children will learn to use a toilet!  Take care...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733379154">Well, I&#39;m going to play devil&#39;s advocate here.  Can someone tell me exactly<br/>
what is wrong with early toilet training if it is done right?  By right, I<br/>
would guess the way that we did it back in the dark ages.  It wasn&#39;t a big<br/>
deal, you were in the bathroom for whatever reason and you plotted the<br/>
kidlet on the toilet and asked if they thought they might want to [insert<br/>
name of choice] in the big potty.  You folded towels and put them away, put<br/>
on your make-up, cleaned the sink, whatever.  If they did, cheering, if<br/>
they didn&#39;t, no big deal and a o.k., maybe next time.  No trauma, no force,<br/>
no big deal.  Of course, the boys were the easiest as they liked to watch<br/>
it splash, kind of a monkey see, monkey do thing with daddy or uncle or big<br/>
brother.  Again, no big deal.  As long as you caught them before the<br/>
terrible 2&#39;s it wasn&#39;t any big deal.  They love making the toilet flush and<br/>
watching the water swirl and gurgle, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, some folks got carried away and it became a competition but you are<br/>
going to see that in any area of child rearing.  And, all in all, it is<br/>
healthier for the kids to be out of the diapers.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The method <br/>
&gt; &gt; that worked pretty well for us was to take a day when we didn&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; &gt; anywhere else to go,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think this is one of the keys and maybe one reason why children of the<br/>
&gt; past seem to have been trained earlier.  They were usually around home<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;The  biggest trick is getting them to go the first time in the toilet.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; When that <br/>
&gt; &gt; happened, they were excited and yes, we did kind of cheer (not <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally <br/>
&gt; &gt; internal rewards, I know).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read a lot about the supposed benefits of nonchalance in this<br/>
&gt; endeavor, but we get excited about all kinds of other firsts for our<br/>
&gt; children.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with letting them know we are proud<br/>
&gt; of their ability to use the toilet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734557640">Well, cloth diapers require lots of water for cleaning.  (But so does<br/>
flushing!)  Either way, we humans use a lot of resources.  The planet<br/>
might be better off without us.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, I agree with Lynda that it&#39;s good for kid&#39;s bottoms to<br/>
be out of diapers and an important thing is to be kind to the child, no<br/>
matter how or when you do it.<br/>
<br/>
Did I send in the link for the essay about &quot;Elimination Training&quot;?  There<br/>
is a book by that name and a big part of it is having babies and toddlers<br/>
without diapers most of the time.  The parent learns to recognize when<br/>
the child is about to eliminate and holds them over a potty.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
read the book, but the guy who wrote the essay did.  I&#39;m done having<br/>
children, but I thought it was an interesting idea.  Besides, what do<br/>
people in poor countries do?<br/>
<br/>
One more comment - I&#39;ve used both cloth and disposable.  I think<br/>
disposables make it WAY easier for the parent to delay &quot;potty training&quot;<br/>
(still don&#39;t like that term!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232267941">I worked in hospitals and for docs and UTI&#39;s in little boys and girls and<br/>
vaginal infections in little girls were almost unheard of when there was<br/>
the big race on to get them out of diapers at an early age.  I remember the<br/>
docs ranting on and on about it because the mothers didn&#39;t want to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you have to remember that diseases are spread from feces and urine<br/>
and the ones that end up in landfills are loaded the countryside with<br/>
different diseases.  I wish they had never invented the dratted things! <br/>
Being &quot;older than dirt,&quot; I remember the first disposables and you flushed<br/>
the centers of them and then just had that liner and plastic outside.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why they stopped doing that.<br/>
