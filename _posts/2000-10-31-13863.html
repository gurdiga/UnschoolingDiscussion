<br/>
You can also buy cd repair kits that come with a liquid and a polishing <br/>
cloth. The data is actually below the surface and not damaged by the <br/>
scratches. Cleaning up the surface allows the data to be read again. Most <br/>
stores that sell cds don&#39;t sell the kits for obvious reasons. I found one <br/>
on-line though.<br/>

We just bought a bottle of the stuff for $10 at Hastings last week and then <br/>
saw at the other end of the checkout counter a $3 kit.  So it goes! &lt;g&gt;</div>

Haven&#39;t tried it yet. I read about it in either Fortune or the Wall Street <br/>
Journal. I can&#39;t remember which, but those are the only business periodicals <br/>
I read. Here are a few of links including a product review.<br/>
