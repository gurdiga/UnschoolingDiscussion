 P.S. to Myranda.  I know a lot about money troubles, and I also know a lot <br/>
 about being the beneficiary of other peoples&#39; generosity. during hard <br/>
 times.  I have had a very hard time accepting help from people, but I <br/>
 realized that the only way to repay kindnesses like that is to turn around <br/>
 and help other people when they need it and want it.  That is what <br/>
 community is all about, and the Internet has created these strangely <br/>
 dispersed communities of like-minded people.  So, if there were some way to <br/>
 set up a fund to help you go to the conference, I hope you would be able to <br/>
 see it as a sort of barn-raising kind of community thing.  (I don&#39;t know if <br/>
 I&#39;m making any sense at all; more stream-of-consciousness, muttered <br/>
 ramblings from a sleep-deprived mom!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes!!!<br/>
Marji put that really, really well.<br/>
