Why? That was some of my favorite kind of escapism/play/fantasy stuff when I was a kid...still is. It&#39;s a really unhealthy thing to label some fantasy as &quot;bad&quot;. Fantasy is fantasy. No one should be making some daydreaming/play seem bad to a kid. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with Ren.  I don&#39;t see any harm in playing and pretending things like witches.  I did when I was a kid, but I didn&#39;t become a witch, lol.  Superheros have powers too, is that the same thing?  Maybe you&#39;re overly sensitive to witchcraft in general?  I kinda like the way that the Sabrina show points out that even though they have witchcraft powers, they still get themselves in spots where their powers can&#39;t help much.  They still have to think their way out of situations.  Powers aren&#39;t everything.<br/>
