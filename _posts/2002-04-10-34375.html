<div id="ygrps-yiv-605832750">This morning:<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (11) went to milk her goat but the babies got loose this morning and<br/>
helped themselves to breakfast so she is figuring out how to secure the pen.<br/>
She just got back from a sewing project for 4-H and finished a small quilt<br/>
that folds into a pillow.<br/>
<br/>
Zach (8) got the little kids breakfast in exchange for me taking care of his<br/>
rabbits this morning since we were in a hurry to get Adriane to her project.<br/>
He is finishing his laundry (had to wash a baseball uniform) and playing a<br/>
combination of pool and hot wheels with his sister.  He is saving the<br/>
Pringles can from lunch to make a &quot;telescope&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Marsie (5) has been looking at books and playing  with a phonics type game.<br/>
She is currently playing with Zach and practicing whistling (her latest<br/>
skill).<br/>
<br/>
Daniel (3) has been throwing rocks in the puddle out front and watching the<br/>
ripples.  He is currently sitting in my lap and we are<br/>
discussing/showing/playing how keyboarding transfers to letters on the<br/>
monitor.  He is tired after a late night at baseball where he learned to do<br/>
monkey bars.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle (2) is playing her favorite game &quot;What color is it?&quot;  where she<br/>
repeatedly asks that question about whatever object comes into her line of<br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
Julie (real old) helped care for goats and rabbits this morning.  She<br/>
researched a variety of rabbit to find the appropriate markings for showing<br/>
the rabbit.  She turned the lye soap she is curing and made a nutritious<br/>
lunch for her brood.  A friend stopped by and Julie and the kids and friend<br/>
discussed bee keeping (the wheres, whys, whats and such).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you have bees?  We just got our new swarm in last week.  We tried <br/>
last year and lost three queens to various demises.  This year&#39;s swarm <br/>
seems SOOOoooo much healthier.  They aren&#39;t really our bees exactly.  <br/>
One of our friends has been keeping bees for years and he wanted to <br/>
use corner of our property in exchange for half the honey.  So they <br/>
are sort of jointly owned bees.  <br/>
We did get a whole lot of beewax out of the deal though.  He gave us <br/>
last year&#39;s frames to melt the wax out of since they may be deseased.<br/>
