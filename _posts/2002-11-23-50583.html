<div id="ygrps-yiv-15172625">Greetings Yol,<br/>
   I have been a follower of Krsna Consciousness since 1972.  I lot <br/>
of my friends send their kids to public school and I have tried to <br/>
start a group for Vaisnava homeschoolers, but there just does not <br/>
seem to be many out there.  What a delight to find some one else of <br/>
similar life style also unschooling.  You may email me at my home <br/>
email address if you would like.  I will definately visit your site. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Hare Krsna,  Jai Sri Rama<br/>
Blessing,<br/>
Govinda<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378981994">Hi,<br/>
Sorry it is taking so long to reply to your messagges.  Sunday we <br/>
went to town and took our boy to see the new Harry Potter movie.  We <br/>
live a hour out of town so we usually make a full day of it.<br/>
  I&#39;ve been involved with Krsna Consciousness since 1972.  Another <br/>
name you could call it is Sanatana Dharma, or in English the eternal <br/>
religion or occupation of the soul. Basically Krsna is a name for <br/>
God, meaning all attractive.  The Vedic scriptures  explain that God <br/>
has many different names according to His different activities and <br/>
qualities.  <br/>
  We are are serving God, either directly through his spiritual <br/>
energy or through his material energy. The understanding is that we <br/>
are eternal spiritual beings meant to serve God directly in a <br/>
personal loving relationship, but due to taking on these material <br/>
coverings and identifications we have forgotten our true spiritual <br/>
identity.  We believe in reincarnation and the law of Karma (as you <br/>
sew, so shall you reap. Or put another way what goes around comes <br/>
around)  This is one important reason we are strict vegetarians.<br/>
  This human form of body is meant for self-realization and realizing <br/>
once again our eternal relationship with God. For this to happen we <br/>
have to get free of thinking that we are these material bodies, which <br/>
are temporary and always changing.  The way the Vedic scriptures <br/>
suggest we can do this is by glorifying the names of  God, and <br/>
hearing about Him and His eternal activities in the eteral spiritual <br/>
realm. The Vedas are the oldest scriptures on earth and discribe the <br/>
activieties of Krsna when he appeared on this planet in His eternal <br/>
form around 5000 years ago. <br/>
   Everyone is looking to be happy, But this material world is like a <br/>
prison house. Our society educates us on how to try and find <br/>
happyness by so many temperay  material solutions to the endless <br/>
problems of this world.  We want to search out the means to stop all <br/>
suffering and find that eternal peace within us that is our rightful <br/>
heritage, since we are the children of the most opulent Father.<br/>
   Okay, this is as brief as I know how to make it.  I hope I do not <br/>
sound preachy.  There are many books I could point you to if you want <br/>
to hear from a more qualified source and go into more depth.  But if <br/>
you have any specific questions, I will try to answer to the best of <br/>
my ability and realization.  This is a form of yoga in the &quot;Bhagavada-<br/>
Gita&quot; Krsna calls in Bhakti yoga, or the yoga of devotion. Originally <br/>
yoga was the means for self-realization and conecting ourselves to <br/>
God.<br/>
  Getting late and this has gotten a bit long, I hope not to much.<br/>
Govinda<br/>

My upbringing is so different from those philosophies and beliefs, yet they really speak so many truths to me,  does that make any sense?    <br/>
Just as unschooling is like a foreign language to alot of my family,    these beliefs would probably be as foreign to them.  unfortunately,<br/>
 <br/>
I guess for me certain things ring true to me and it doesn&#39;t matter that I was raised a certain way,   I can tell what feels right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970319291">Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t limit yourselves to Krsna Consciousness (no disrespect to Krishna, I love Lord Krishna).<br/>
Do a search on *hinduism* which is where this comes from. It would be much more embracing. There are so many lineages in hindusim!<br/>
My family and I follow a yogic path as well, and it is also from the Vaishnava tradition (related to Lord Vishnu, as Krsna Consciousness) but we are devotees of a different incarnation of Vishnu, named Lord Ram. We also love to chant (bhakti yoga) and our practices are mainly meditation (dhyan yoga) and mantra repetition (japa).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes,  I would also like to read about it,  I am just starting my<br/>
&gt; own religious search,  and have loved my yoga experience.        My<br/>
&gt; daughters have really enjoyed doing yoga with me too.  I think there<br/>
&gt; are alot of benefits for children too,  the stretches really help<br/>
&gt; them relieve stress and the breathing is very beneficial in dealing<br/>
&gt; with anger.           I think anyway,  I&#39;m quite new to this.<br/>

&gt; &gt;        could you share some things about krsna consciousness. i<br/>
&gt; have never<br/>
&gt; &gt; heard of this before but enjoy learning of other religons. my<br/>
&gt; husband and i<br/>
&gt; &gt; are pretty much on a spirtual quest most of the time. i recently<br/>
&gt; found out<br/>
&gt; &gt; that there is a church of wicca here  in town and can&#39;t wait to<br/>
&gt; visit there<br/>
&gt; &gt; soon.<br/>
