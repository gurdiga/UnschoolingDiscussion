and lack of rights that women have had to endure over the ages is <br/>
born of religion.    When a man can look on a woman as his <br/>
property to do with as he pleases and have society tell him that he <br/>
is lord and master over her, then women will be used and abused.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuatley the same can be said of children, to many parents <br/>
their children are their property to do with as they please, there is <br/>
not enough equal treatment of children either. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly what we can thank for the freedoms that we <br/>
now enjoy, my Great-grandmother never was a chatel to her <br/>
husband, she was a strong woman who always had her say.  I <br/>
guess she may have been out of the ordinary back then [she was <br/>
born in 1876] but she couldn&#39;t have been unique.  She raised strong <br/>
daughters who wouldn&#39;t take shit from men and they in turn did the <br/>
same.  Who knows where it all started, how women finally decided <br/>
they weren&#39;t going to take it anymore.<br/>

When I was in Highschool I had this problem!  I would tell my boyfriend that <br/>

we reached for the door at the  same time and I bonked him in the head with <br/>
it.  poor guy.  I now let any man who wishes to open the door for me as I <br/>
now understand they are just trying to be polite!  LOL<br/>

&gt; &gt; O.K., this is an serious, honest question and not an attempt to start <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt; war.  I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think  <br/>
&gt;feminism<br/>
&gt; &gt; has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of feminism, we <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we gained?<br/>

&gt;Good question Lynda....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think feminism has turned a lot of women into pseudo--men, in<br/>
&gt;trying to be equal some women have denigrated what is was to be<br/>
&gt;a woman.  Why they felt the need to be equal [except along the<br/>
&gt;lines of equal pay for equal work] is beyond me, why strive to be<br/>
&gt;what you are not, men and women are not equal, they are different.<br/>
&gt;   Personally I like it when a man opens a door for me or raises his<br/>
&gt;hat as a greeting, however many men are afraid to open doors<br/>
&gt;because of responses they sometimes encounter &quot;I CAN OPEN<br/>
&gt;DOORS FOR MYSELF&quot; etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I personally can&#39;t think of any real good that has come from the<br/>
&gt;feminism movement.  I&#39;m talking 60s here, as it was earlier<br/>
&gt;feminists that gained the vote for women and the acceptance of<br/>
&gt;women wearing trousers they were good things.    But on the down<br/>
&gt;side the feminist movement has made women say such things as<br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;m ONLY a housewife&quot; with shame instead of the pride women<br/>
&gt;once felt in their role as wife and Mother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Men and women are different and thank Mother Nature for that<br/>
&gt;difference!   I can work as hard and as long as many men,<br/>
&gt;especially since I can wear jeans and not be restricted by the type<br/>
&gt;of garment I am wearing, but it sure feels good when working hard<br/>
&gt;to have a pair of strong male arms there to help out with the real<br/>
&gt;heavy stuff.   Most men are physically stronger and larger than<br/>
&gt;most women, this is an inescapable fact, a fact which is driven<br/>
&gt;home to me each time I work alongside my 15 year old son who<br/>
&gt;just two years ago had the body and strength of a child.   To see<br/>
&gt;the way he can lift things with one arm that I have to fight to move<br/>
&gt;with both of mine reinforces that difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In most cases the differences between male and female are<br/>
&gt;complimentary, our strengths and weaknesses are often at<br/>
&gt;opposite ends of the poles, so together can make a good team.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been a SAHM Mom for many years, I have worked a few part<br/>
&gt;time jobs [tupperware etc] especially in the earlier years.  The<br/>
&gt;most important thing to me when deciding on what work I could do<br/>
&gt;was to ensure that either my Mother or husband would be available<br/>
&gt;to look after the children while I was working.  This was for little<br/>
&gt;extras, my oldest son was really into computers and devoured<br/>
&gt;books on the subject long before we had one, so I sold tupperware<br/>
&gt;to buy a Commodore 64 for his use.  Now I guess I am sort of a<br/>
&gt;working Mom, but the big difference is that I work at home so I am<br/>
&gt;here if the kids need me, and another big bonus is that they can be<br/>
&gt;involved and understand what I do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Summing up; for me feminism has given me the right to vote and<br/>
&gt;wear jeans, however it has taken from me the chance to feel as<br/>
&gt;though society values my role, if there is no $ value on it then it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to have a value.<br/>
