<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898658064">Well, if we have to give up all the subjects that get folks&#39; dander up, then<br/>
I guess we can&#39;t talk about not only politics and religion but must also<br/>
leave out vaccinations, family beds, corporal punishment, H$LDA, the<br/>
definition of &quot;unschooling,&quot; teachers, public school, curriculum, hmmmm.<br/>
What do we get to talk about &lt;g&gt; zzzzzzzzzz<br/>
<br/>
Guess, we&#39;ll just have to up the caffeine to stay awake &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
