<div id="ygrps-yiv-550180408">Welcome Jonathan,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you had such a tough time in school. Unfortunatly, this is not<br/>
uncommon. Which is why we do what we do. I&#39;m sure I have at least one<br/>
learning disability. Unfortunatly, these things were not easily diagnosed 30<br/>
years ago. My oldest daughter is dyslexic, ADD, and has processing speed<br/>
disorder. I&#39;m glad we knew early on that school is the wrong place for kids<br/>
like her. I had a miserable kindergartener. Now I&#39;ve got a bright, vibrant,<br/>
happy second grader. I&#39;m so glad we &quot;saw the light&quot;. Hopefully, you will go<br/>
on to live a happy and fufilled adulthood. I&#39;m sure your input on this list<br/>
will be appreciated (although some folks might like it if you tone down your<br/>
language a bit-some of us have little ones ahnging around the computer with<br/>
us).<br/>
Welcome Again,<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; righ off the bat you&#39;ll going to have to excuse the spelling of anything i<br/>
&gt; post--i just a little on the dyslixic side of things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have a little confushion to make. I am 22 just over the teen list<br/>
&gt; age. But i thought i&#39;d indroduce myself, my work, and see if you&#39;ll will<br/>
&gt; make an exception. I joined the list becuase i had a fucking nightmare<br/>
&gt; exsperince in school and i feel that i could be a resouce for people in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; unschooling population who stuggle wiht Learning disabities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was diagnossed with Dyslixia in four grade and depression as a reulst of<br/>
&gt; living in fucking systmes that can not understand diffrence. I did not<br/>
&gt; actually learn to read untill i was 12--at that point the shame,<br/>
&gt; hummilation, and anger that felt towards a school system that was<br/>
&gt; systemcially teaching me that i was worthless and stupid was to much to<br/>
&gt; bear--i dorped out with the support of my partents completly. i have to<br/>
say<br/>
&gt; that perioed was one of the most difficult times in mylife--sucicde was<br/>
&gt; cerntently on my mind most of the time. our schools have so much power and<br/>
&gt; this power if very rearlly quested--in the end they are more concered with<br/>
&gt; socilzaing conformaty then empowering people as thinkers. But when you are<br/>
&gt; 12 that shit is to hard to understand specfically when the common<br/>
&gt; assocation with a learning disabilty is that you are stupid that spelling<br/>
&gt; is a direct indication of how your minds works.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But my story does that end there. I was lucky to be a gifted soccer player<br/>
&gt; and reenrooled under that pignoned indenty which schools are so quick to<br/>
&gt; give out. I ended up barging graduating and reviving a school<br/>
scholarship....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But i decided to drop soccer a go with of all things writing (there is a<br/>
&gt; lot of shit left out here in the abriged vershion--problmes wiht achohall,<br/>
&gt; a coulpe of artsest, tranfersing unversityies, you the good stuff). Now I<br/>
&gt; am a recent graduate for Brown University and author of the forth coming<br/>
&gt; book entitled Learning Outside the Lines (Simon & Schuster, September<br/>
&gt; 2000). It book is based on the success stories of me and my co-author. It<br/>
&gt; starts with my journey from being a sixth grade drop and  then turns to my<br/>
&gt; co-author--diagnosed with ADHD in second grade, high school drop out<br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; IVY league student also. Together we then explore and outline the learning<br/>
&gt; strategies that we have used to be successful as alternative learns, to be<br/>
&gt; successful as people learn out side the lines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This book dirctly attacks that fucked things about ourschools and its<br/>
goals<br/>
&gt; it to outline a road map for learning outside the lines, it takes the<br/>
&gt; reader on a journey towards personal empowerment and profound educational<br/>
&gt; change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that all kids deserve an education that is about freedom,<br/>
&gt; empowerment, and educational revolution. you guys have mad courge for<br/>
&gt; pursing an education that is fucking truly outside the lines. i wish this<br/>
&gt; tyep of enviorment would of been around for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if i can be of any help, around the issue of ld, or aroudn the isseu of<br/>
&gt; going to college after untraditional education please feel free to<br/>
