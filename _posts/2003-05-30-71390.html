Your kid should get together with my kids.. They can REALLY let the language <br/>
fly. LOL.  But,  I have not lost any friends over it.  Mostly because my kids <br/>
only use  foul language around thier immediate family.  I think they curb <br/>
thier language in public because of going to school and getting conditioned that <br/>
bad language is not acceptable.   Anybody who is that offended by a kids <br/>
language is pretty shallow, if you ask me.   I know it must be difficult to have to <br/>
deal with, I wish folks WOULD be more understanding and realize . HEY, they <br/>
are just kids! <br/>
