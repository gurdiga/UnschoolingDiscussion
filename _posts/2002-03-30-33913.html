<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607217938">Hi all! :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a wild and wonderful two year old and I&#39;m thinking and exploring and <br/>
reading about different school, homeschool, unschool, megaschool, nonschool, <br/>
ultraubersuperschool, etc. options available to us as my husband and I <br/>
consider trying to keep him alive to the age of 18. :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess what we&#39;re doing right now is probably somewhere between unschool <br/>
and homeschool. But I won&#39;t get into that ;) I&#39;m sure you DON&#39;T want to hear <br/>
about it!<br/>
<br/>
My question is this: How do unschoolers feel about lessons? Piano lessons, <br/>
swimming lessons, tai chi lessons, etc. I&#39;m talking about where the child <br/>
goes to a place, with another adult, not the parent, and learns in a <br/>
structured way about something. Ever do that? Or is it bad-bad-bad?<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
LILY<br/>

<br/>
I have one who is very involved in a karate school, and has been for six <br/>
years.  I shopped around for one that was more into philosophy than <br/>
&quot;fighting,&quot; and we&#39;re really  happy with it.  Kirby teaches one of the <br/>
beginning classes each week, and participates with the adults in seminars and <br/>
special events.  They would let him be in the adult class, but he prefers the <br/>
advanced kids&#39; class, because he has friends there he&#39;s known for years and <br/>
that&#39;s the only time he sees them.  Most of them are totally scheduled all <br/>
week with other lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has taken dance classes and is in an acting class for homeschoolers <br/>
(ending at the end of April) and is about to start a year at an acting school <br/>
where she knows no one.  She&#39;s really excited about it though.  When we <br/>
signed her up we told them our priority as parents was that she have fun and <br/>
not be overly pressured.  We said she was doing it because SHE wanted to,  <br/>
and if she didn&#39;t like it we wouldn&#39;t press her to continue.  They didn&#39;t act <br/>
like they had heard that before.  It doesn&#39;t matter; that&#39;s our deal with <br/>
Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Marty played ice hockey one year but didn&#39;t like the locker room culture and <br/>
traditions.  He had taken six skating levels before that (a deal he made with <br/>
me--that he could play hockey if he took their six classes first so he would <br/>
be a really competent skater and less likely to get huled with the &quot;OH aren&#39;t <br/>
you CUTE!&quot; from the older girls and women (he was eight).<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Holly was learning fiddle from a homeschooling dad (violinist from age 8 <br/>
who three years ago started doing Celtic and bluegrass) who was himself <br/>
experimenting with teaching in a more student-focussed and less &quot;curriculum&quot; <br/>
focussed way, so it was an experiment for both of them.  She&#39;s taking a break <br/>
from the lessons, but still practices sometimes and fully intends to go back, <br/>
maybe in summer.<br/>
<br/>
If the child is the focus and not the &quot;subject matter,&quot; if it comes from <br/>
their interest and curiosity and not the parents&#39; pressure or requirement, <br/>
the traditional pressures aren&#39;t so much in effect.   If it&#39;s something they <br/>
can&#39;t do at home (ice skating, acting in a play in a real theatre), their <br/>
voluntary participation doesn&#39;t, in my opinion, change the unschooling aspect <br/>
of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If I convinced them (subtly or overtly) that they weren&#39;t likely to learn <br/>
science or history at our house, but they needed to want to take classes <br/>
elsewhere, I&#39;d think neither I nor they were very clear on the potential of <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

the lessons, helps find the teacher/class and isn&#39;t &quot;forced&quot; to practice or<br/>

<br/>
Seriously - we sometimes use experts, of course. But it is not IMPOSED - it <br/>
is by choice. When the kids take piano lessons - which they&#39;ve all done at <br/>
different times - it is because they REALLY want to do it. If they don&#39;t want <br/>
to continue, then they don&#39;t continue. <br/>
<br/>
The difference is that the child is doing the choosing - and is choosing to <br/>
learn something from that expert and can choose to stop it if they don&#39;t <br/>
think it is working for them or if they just lose interest.<br/>
<br/>
And, before you ask, yes sometimes they just don&#39;t feel like going THAT day <br/>
and yes I nudge a bit and encourage them to recognize that it is a momentary <br/>
whim and to see that they&#39;d be sorry to drop the whole activity because they <br/>
didn&#39;t feel like going to one lesson. And no I don&#39;t make them practice EVER <br/>
and yes I&#39;m willing to pay for lessons because it is LESSONS that they want <br/>
(assuming we can afford them). And yes there are weeks and months that they <br/>
don&#39;t practice, but just show up at the lesson each week unprepared. I make <br/>
sure we have teachers who are okay with that and tell them I&#39;m willing to pay <br/>
for that half-hour a week of them working with my kid even if the progress is <br/>
super slow at times because the kids don&#39;t practice. And yes the kids do <br/>
practice in spurts. My 14 yo is now asking to go back to piano and violin <br/>
lessons and she&#39;s spending a lot of time playing piano and violin on her own <br/>
right now. She&#39;ll definitely practice on her own too because she&#39;s highly <br/>
motivated right now. If she loses interest and wants to spend her time doing <br/>
something else, later, then that&#39;s what she&#39;ll do.<br/>

We&#39;ve done it sometimes.  Karate.  Ice hockey.  Fiddle lessons.  We take <br/>
steps to keep it from being bad-bad.  I&#39;ve given teachers copies of articles <br/>
on homeschooling, and told them we&#39;re avoiding harsh criticism, and have told <br/>
them that if the kids lose interest that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
What their teachers have liked the most about them is the sweet openness, <br/>
their true desire to learn, their active curiosity...  So the few times <br/>
there&#39;s been a problem, I&#39;ve reminded them they LIKE those kids, and the <br/>
difference is directly attributable to their being homeschooled, and so not <br/>
to razz them about unschooling.<br/>

of the very few without some kind of prior medical training (she had <br/>
a Red Cross 1st aid card), and had never been in a classroom <br/>
environment before. She showed up at the first day of classes without <br/>
so much as a notebook and pen!<br/>
<br/>
She still laughs about her final essay paper - she&#39;d torn it up in <br/>
frustration the night before it was due, then thought &quot;what the hell&quot; <br/>
and straightened it all back out, taped the rips, and turned it in.<br/>
<br/>
She aced the class, and when Mark went to pick her up at graduation <br/>
the instructors quizzed him for an hour about homeschooling, saying <br/>
they&#39;d *never* seen anyone with the kind of learning abilities Jody <br/>
had evidenced. They&#39;ve asked her to come back many times since then <br/>
to help train others. I hope someday she takes them up on the offer, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33354008">I know I&#39;m late responding to this.  I&#39;m way backlogged on e-mail. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still a very green, trying-to-find-my-way, let go kind of unschooler. (I <br/>
probably couldn&#39;t even call myself that yet...but I hope to be there)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m going to say in advance that I have a lot of questions and doubts <br/>
of my own related to unschooling.  And I really feel like I need the advice <br/>
from folks on this list  about some of those questions.  So, I want to make a <br/>
disclaimer in the beginning and state that I am not trying to intentionally <br/>
come on this list and challenge any of you.  I am truly trying to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
So here goes...<br/>
<br/>
This is about the issue of children being forced to do certain activities, <br/>
etc.  <br/>
I happen to have a couple of children who are very cautious and very <br/>
unwilling to try new things.  And yet, when they have been gently pushed into <br/>
some of these things, they find out that they love them.  My eldest daughter, <br/>
for example, has a lovely voice and loves to sing.  There was a show choir <br/>
she could be in and my hubby and I really kind of pushed her to do it because <br/>
we felt she needed the social stimulation.  It was a difficult first six <br/>
months and she had her ups and downs.  We let her skip rehearsals and <br/>
performances and didn&#39;t push her to sign up again for another year.  She did <br/>
all by herself, though, and now in her second year, this is the top priority <br/>
in her life and something she totally &quot;lives for&quot; each week.  Besides that, <br/>
she has made several good friends in the group.<br/>
<br/>
I just wonder-if we wouldn&#39;t have &quot;pushed&quot; her, would she have even known <br/>
that this opportunity existed?  Or probably she would have come around to it <br/>
on her own, right?  This is where the trust comes in, isn&#39;t it?  I&#39;ve got to <br/>
trust that she can find what she needs when she needs it.  But I can <br/>
certainly offer resources.  That&#39;s how I envision my role, as a mentor or a <br/>
resource person if she asks.  Is that the idea?  I know I&#39;m asking lots of <br/>
questions, but I&#39;m just craving some enlightenment!  Enlighten me, please!  <br/>
How do I let go?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes it helps to picture your husband doing to you whatever you feel is<br/>
necessary to do to your child. Would you want him to spend 6 months urging<br/>
you to keep going to something? Would the fact that you ended up liking it<br/>
justify his coercion?<br/>
<br/>
I think going twice is enough. My daughter thinks once :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think she&#39;ll miss out on some things if she makes the decision after<br/>
trying something (that she chose to do on her own) once. But the world is<br/>
full of opportunities and that one thing won&#39;t make or break her life.<br/>
<br/>
If I suggest giving a movie 15 minutes and she decides she doesn&#39;t like it<br/>
after that 15 mintues but the next 15 minutes would have turned her around<br/>
and it would have turned out to be one of her favorite movies, well, oh<br/>
well! There&#39;s *lots* of movies in the world! And she has *lots* of life left<br/>
to perhaps get past that first 15 minutes some time in the future. Because<br/>
*if* I push her that extra 15 minutes and I&#39;m *wrong* the damage is far<br/>
worse than if she misses out on something.<br/>
<br/>
Every time she makes a decision, she&#39;s learning more about herself and<br/>
learning more about making decisions. :-)<br/>

will happen that way. If your child has a lovely voice and LOVES to sing and <br/>
you think she&#39;d love to sing in a group, it would seem to me to be a kind and <br/>
thoughtful thing for you, who love her, to find such a group for her. And if <br/>
your daughter is slow to warm up to things, but you know from past experience <br/>
that she WILL warm up and really appreciate you urging her on - then you know <br/>
that and she knows that and its part of the parent/child dance you have with <br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I have to persuade my dear delightful and darling husband to do things, <br/>
very very often. He has a personality type that usually makes him turn down <br/>
invitations and opportunities right off the bat - I figure that&#39;s one of the <br/>
reasons he MARRIED me in the first place, so that he&#39;d have someone to push <br/>
him out of his comfort zone once in a while. I&#39;m thoughtful as I can be about <br/>
what I drag him to &lt;G&gt;, and he almost always is very grateful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I see this with her.  I always used to think you had to &quot;teach&quot; kids the <br/>
value of wise decisions.  But, they teach themselves better.  Just recently, <br/>
this same child made the decision to quit piano lessons after almost eight <br/>
years with the same teacher.  The teacher, who had always been kind and warm, <br/>
was very angry and cold to my daughter.  It was extremely hard for my dd, but <br/>
she was firm and decisive and stuck by her desire to take voice lessons <br/>
instead.  All I could think of was WOW...I wish I had had that kind of <br/>
determination at fifteen.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your comments, Joyce and all.<br/>

socializing! &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
