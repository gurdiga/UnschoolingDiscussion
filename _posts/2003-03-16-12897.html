<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935088883">There&#39;s been no request not discuss Iraq on this list, so I hope it&#39;s ok.  I<br/>
realized last night that my feelings of helplessness about this war were<br/>
getting the better of me and I hadn&#39;t done anything at all to try to stop<br/>
it.  So I went to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthfuture.com/stopthewar/">http://www.earthfuture.com/stopthewar/</a> and sent off a<br/>
bunch of emails.  I&#39;ll be going to the local candlelight vigil tonight.  If<br/>
the war happens anyway, at least I tried to do something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; From Coleman Barks, the translator of Rumi, to the US President: Just<br/>
&gt; This Once President Bush, before you order air strikes, imagine the first<br/>
&gt; cruise missile as a direct hit on your  closest friend. That might be<br/>
&gt; Laura. Then twenty-five other family and friends. There are no survivors.<br/>
&gt; Now imagine some other way to do it. Quadruple the inspectors, or put<br/>
&gt; a thousand and one U.N. people in. Then call for peace activists to<br/>
&gt; volunteer to go to Iraq for two weeks each. Flood that country with well<br/>
&gt; meaning tourists, people curious about the land that produced the great<br/>
&gt; saints, Gilani, Hallaj, and Rabia. Set up hostels near those tombs.<br/>
&gt; Encourage peace people to spend a bunch of money in shops, to bring<br/>
&gt; rugs home and samovars by the bushel. Send an Arabic translator with<br/>
&gt; every four peace activists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The U.S. government will pay for the translators and for building and<br/>
&gt; staffing the hostels, one hostel for every twenty activists and five<br/>
&gt; translators. The hostels are state of the art,  and they belong to the<br/>
&gt; Iraqis at the end of this experiment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela, and my friend,  Jonathan Granoff at the<br/>
&gt; U.N.,will be the core organization team. No one knows what might<br/>
&gt; come of this. Maybe nothing, or maybe it would convince some Iraqis<br/>
&gt; and some of the world that we really do not wish to kill anybody, and<br/>
&gt; that we truly are not out to appropriate oil reserves. We&#39;re working on<br/>
&gt; building a hydrogen vehicle as fast as we can, aren&#39;t we? Put no limit on<br/>
&gt; the number of activists from all over who might want to hang out and<br/>
&gt; explore Iraq for two weeks. And get college credit There could be<br/>
&gt; informal courses for pick up soccer games every evening at five. Long<br/>
&gt; leisurely suppers. The U. S. government furnishes air transportation,<br/>
&gt; that is, hires airliners from the country of origin and back for each<br/>
 </span></blockquote>peace<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tourist, who must carry and spend the equivalent of $1001 US inside<br/>
&gt; Iraq. Keep part of the invasion force nearby as police, but let those who<br/>
&gt; claim to deeply detest war try something else just this once, for one<br/>
&gt; year. Call our bluff. If this mad man Saddam&#39;s WMD threat is not,<br/>
&gt; somehow, eliminated by next February, you can go in with special ops,<br/>
&gt; and do it that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Medical services, transportation inside Iraq, lots of big colorful buses -<br/>
&gt; let the pilgrims paint them! - along with many other ideas that will be<br/>
&gt; thought of later during the course of this innocently, blatantly, foolish<br/>
&gt; project will all also be funded by the U.S. government.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a practice known as sama, a deep listening to poetry and<br/>
&gt; music, with movement sometimes involved. We could experiment with<br/>
&gt; whole nights of that, staying up until dawn, sleeping in tents during the<br/>
&gt; day. So instead of war there&#39;s a peace period from March 2003 through<br/>
&gt; February 2004. It could be as though war had already happened, as it<br/>
&gt; has, and the healing and rebuilding. Now we&#39;re in the celebration<br/>
&gt; afterward. I&#39;ll be the first to volunteer for two weeks of wandering<br/>
 </span></blockquote>winter<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; desert and reading Hallaj, Abdul Qadir  Gilani, dear Rabia, and the life-<br/>
&gt; saving 1001 Arabian Nights.<br/>

&gt; I am Coleman Barks, a retired English professor living in Athens,<br/>
&gt; Georgia, and I don&#39;t really consider this proposal foolish.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most groups do not discuss religion, politics, etc because of the huge<br/>
debates those subjects cause.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I am backing Bush and the War.<br/>
<br/>
You need to listen to the song I heard on the radio yesterday.  It goes,&quot;<br/>
Have you forgotten what happened on 9/11&quot;.  It is easy to forget since it is<br/>
not fresh on our minds.  I bet it someone attacked the US tomorrow you would<br/>
change your tune.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway you expressed your opinion and I have expressed mine.  Neither yours<br/>
nor mine will change the war that is going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to work on things that I know will help people on this group<br/>
which is my homeschooling website.<br/>

we&#39;re already victims of war.<br/>

politics.   If we don&#39;t make some havens, there will be none.<br/>

county.  I also feel a sense of frustration about this impending war.  I <br/>
just got back in the door from a march and rally at West Point Military <br/>
Academy, which is located in my county.  We had beautiful weather for a <br/>
change, as we did in the march and rally in Washington, DC, yesterday.  Our <br/>
message today was, &quot;Support our troops, bring them home.&quot;  I was impressed <br/>
with the coalition that was present today: We had a speaker from the <br/>
organization Military Families Speak Out  ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mfso.org/">http://www.mfso.org/</a> ), a <br/>
speaker from the Green party, and a retired lieutenant from the <br/>
marines.  This man was about as right wing and conservative as you can get, <br/>
but he strongly opposes the war in Iraq and the misappropriation of money <br/>
and personnel in that area.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Coleman Barks&#39; message.  I wonder how many *ordinary* people <br/>
would be willing to take two weeks out of their lives and travel over to <br/>
Iraq to wage peace. (I would.)<br/>
<br/>
But, I believe there is a more basic question, and it&#39;s a tough one. In the <br/>
United States we have become accustomed to a certain standard of living <br/>
which depends heavily on the availability of cheap oil.  I wonder how many <br/>
of us would be willing to adopt the changes in our lifestyle necessary to <br/>
reduce our dependence on oil.  I know our government is not willing to <br/>
steward us towards those kinds of changes (actions speak louder than <br/>
words).  But, we, the people, have tremendous untapped power.  I believe <br/>
that all we need is a will and a focus.  If we can equate our comfortable <br/>
lifestyle with the discomfort of children in other quarters of the world, <br/>
and if we can hold that vision, I&#39;d be willing to bet that we could obviate <br/>
the *need* for war.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to an interesting article by Thom Hartmann about how we have <br/>
come to this point in our history.  It&#39;s the best thing I&#39;ve seen yet in <br/>
laying it all out clearly.<br/>

take some steps, like drying laundry outside or walking for errands under 2 miles, cycling<br/>
for 5 mile errands etc etc. I have had to leave the list under a barrage of nastiness about<br/>
being a fanatic, an environmentalist (this is obviously an evil crime in VA....), people<br/>
declaring they love their SUV&#39;s and dryers just to try and annoy me.<br/>
I try and minimise my impact on the earth as much as can given where I live and what is<br/>
available. I cycle to the supermarket and buy organic. I don&#39;t own a dryer. I wont buy<br/>
over-packaged food. My countrysigned the Kyoto treaty - get on to your reps too get America<br/>
to do the same.<br/>

exception to my &#39;End Oil Addiction, ride a bike&#39; sticker.<br/>

Something has to change though. The world cannot support everyone living in western<br/>
oppulance, even if we wished it. I&#39;d like to see a movement back to simpler lifestyles,<br/>
more community based, more public transport, more locally grown produce. People having time<br/>
for easch other rather than having a palm pilot in one hand adnd a cell phone clamped to<br/>
one ear.<br/>

say it&#39;s not easy to ignore when your son is involved.  <br/>
<br/>
My son comes home from his Army training on Tuesday.  He and Mandy have an <br/>
apartment waiting, which means he&#39;s moving out of my house.  His unit has not <br/>
been activated as of yet, but that could change this week.  650 of my own <br/>
former National Guard unit have gone already.  I am trying to keep my house <br/>
peaceful, too, but there will be no peace in my heart until this is over and <br/>
my son is safe with his fiance and back in college.  <br/>
<br/>
All of you who have opinions about what our government is doing and opinions <br/>
about people on the opposite side of the fence as you, stop and think about <br/>
me, and the rest of the folks like me, for whom this is not just a <br/>
discussion.<br/>

We will have peace on the planet when we all lead peaceful lives.  <br/>
That&#39;s one of the many reasons I am an unschooling mom for my 2 boys.  <br/>
Thanks so much for your thoughts on this war on Iraq.  For some reason <br/>
so many people are connecting the war to the 9/11 tragedy, when there is <br/>
no connection.  I don&#39;t want Iraqi people, mostly children, to die for <br/>
any reason.<br/>
<br/>
We all need to raise our voices for peace regardless of the location.  <br/>
Peace is our goal.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Tia!<br/>

==========================<br/>
[hs-ca] (Fwd) Dearest President  from Coleman Barks<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been no request not discuss Iraq on this list, so I hope it&#39;s <br/>
ok.  I<br/>
realized last night that my feelings of helplessness about this war were<br/>
getting the better of me and I hadn&#39;t done anything at all to try to stop<br/>
it.  So I went to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthfuture.com/stopthewar/">http://www.earthfuture.com/stopthewar/</a> and sent off a<br/>
bunch of emails.  I&#39;ll be going to the local candlelight vigil tonight.  <br/>
If<br/>
the war happens anyway, at least I tried to do something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From Coleman Barks, the translator of Rumi, to the US President: Just<br/>
This Once President Bush, before you order air strikes, imagine the first<br/>
cruise missile as a direct hit on your  closest friend. That might be<br/>
Laura. Then twenty-five other family and friends. There are no survivors.<br/>
Now imagine some other way to do it. Quadruple the inspectors, or put<br/>
a thousand and one U.N. people in. Then call for peace activists to<br/>
volunteer to go to Iraq for two weeks each. Flood that country with well<br/>
meaning tou<br/>

&lt;&lt; Respecting your request not to discuss the politics of it all.  But I have <br/>
to <br/>
say it&#39;s not easy to ignore when your son is involved.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Discussing one&#39;s own child seems a reasonable thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
Discussing ancient enmity between France and England in the context of what&#39;s <br/>
going on today seems to me just to add to the stressfest.  And that part&#39;s <br/>
hard too, because I&#39;ve been fascinated by the France/England thing since <br/>
watching Robin Hood on TV in the 1950&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Where should we draw the line and how do we let people know and keep peace <br/>
here without that itself being a conflict on the list?<br/>
<br/>
-=-stop and think about <br/>
me, and the rest of the folks like me, for whom this is not just a <br/>
discussion.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s exactly WHY I think it would be good to have a place for people to <br/>
get away from it and discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If people have ideas about allowing discussion of immediate family members,  <br/>
let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149879958">First Tuck and all the others, as a person who is surrounded by military<br/>
(and dh just retired after 22 years) you have my warmest thoughts -- we<br/>
went thru the Gulf War in the UK and it was very stressful just being on<br/>
the sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Not to discuss this though:) Just thought I&#39;d share a quick story.<br/>
<br/>
Living here in the Middle East right now is certainly exciting. We are<br/>
currently awaiting possible evacuation orders. All the embassy family<br/>
members in the UAE have gone and just recently we&#39;ve seen Kuwait is on the<br/>
next higher level of evacuation. We don&#39;t know what that means for us yet<br/>
(we seem to follow along a few days after). I just hope they will fly the<br/>
dog and cat out as well as us. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway back to my story. Last week the kids and I were at the mall. They<br/>
were riding on the bumper cars (amusement park inside it) and having a<br/>
blast chasing and hitting another couple of boys. Their mother was standing<br/>
next to me. She was Muslim and spoke little English. We communicated<br/>
somehow as we both kept gasping when they hit too hard. She pointed to her<br/>
neck and I nodded knowing we were worried about the boys getting hurt. She<br/>
then rubbed my 3 month old&#39;s back who was sleeping in his sling. She gave<br/>
him Allah&#39;s blessing and said beautiful baby. I thanked her and she asked<br/>
me where I was from (we all use pidgeon here). I said England and asked her<br/>
where she was from. She smiled at me and said Iraq. I kind of smiled<br/>
nervously/apologetically and she reached out and held my hand against the<br/>
baby. We just kind of stood there for a few minutes and watched our boys<br/>
shrieking with laughter playing on the cars. Then the ride finished and we<br/>
all went our separate ways. I asked my guys if they&#39;d talked to the boys.<br/>
They said sure, they were really nice. I said they are Iraqi. My kids said<br/>
&quot;yeah. we know. So what.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice meeting. <br/>

I can&#39;t stomach debate about the issue, especially if it&#39;s heated.  I&#39;m <br/>
conflicted in all ways about it.  I&#39;ve decided to focus all the energy I <br/>
would have otherwise given to a debate of such an issue to sending positive <br/>
energy out to my son.  It&#39;s all I can do.<br/>
