All life  long it keeps popping up in supermarkets, kitchens, workshops, <br/>
offices,  almost everywhere - even in the far reaches of the backwoods. When <br/>
it  <br/>
does, the schools have left most of us no alternative to going into a  trance <br/>
and trying to remember elementary textbook  procedures...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------<br/>
 <br/>
I know that feeling.<br/>
 <br/>
That book sounds pretty good!   My kids are so calm and competent  with <br/>
numbers...  I&#39;m jealous.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby&#39;s staying at the dojo where he does karate while his teacher (who  <br/>
lives there) is out of town for five days.  He said he had been shown the  DVD <br/>
collection and told me the big number of DVDs.  I&#39;m not good with  numbers.<br/>
 <br/>
Later Holly asked me what Kirby was going to do while he was there, and I  <br/>
said watch movies, because there were 1800 DVDs.   Holly looked at me  and <br/>
repeated &quot;eighteen HUNdred&quot;?  But not like &quot;really?&quot;  Sounded  like, &quot;That&#39;s not <br/>
right, you&#39;re mis-remembering.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So I immediately doubted myself entirely, because I have no internal  <br/>
chalkboard for numbers it seems.  A very funhouse-mirror one, anyway.   So I assumed <br/>
I was wrong and said &quot;I don&#39;t know, ask Kirby.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The real number was 1900. <br/>
But the whole thing was stress-inducing for me.  <br/>
Re-telling it makes me feel ashamed.<br/>
 <br/>
Tacky, huh?<br/>
 <br/>
OH!  Holly didn&#39;t know the concept &quot;to be ashamed.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
She was going to watch Stephen Lynch video (again) the other day, and she  <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m going to go watch that, okay?&quot; (because we had been doing something  <br/>
together upstairs) and I said, &quot;Okay, as long as you&#39;re ashamed of  yourself.&quot;  <br/>
(The humor is embarrassingly offensive and horrible, which is  what makes it <br/>
funny.)   <br/>
 <br/>
Holly said, &quot;What&#39;s &#39;ashamed&#39;?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Wow.  Thirteen.<br/>
I knew it well before I can remember.<br/>
I knew the finger-wiping symbol for it (anyone know where that comes from,  <br/>
pointing an index finger at the person and rubbing it donwards repetedly with  <br/>
the other, like wiping something toward the other person?), and told the  <br/>
northern-New-Mexico quiet shaming noise which she asked me how to spell and I  <br/>
said I had no idea, but it&#39;s kind of like &quot;OHmmmmbers...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I have a lot of knowledge of shame and Holly had none.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t feel guilty about liking Stephen Lynch, I guess.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

What&#39;s his <br/>
style like?  Can you describe it or should I just see it for myself?<br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
Musically, folky.  Acoustic guitar (nothing fancy, simple accompaniments), <br/>
some times harmonies (he has a singer/foil), and once on the DVD, his brother <br/>
sings with them so there&#39;s a brief three-part harmony, on &quot;D&D&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lyrically, purposely shockingly offensive.  The songs usually start off sweet <br/>
and turn halfway through, and it&#39;s the kind of stuff you might laugh at and <br/>
then be embarrassed you laugh, and then hear another line and laugh so loud you <br/>
miss the next line.  And then those who know shame feel deeply ashamed for <br/>
having thought anything so disgusting was funny.  Nasty, sexist, stupid, <br/>
politically incorrect, vulgar and funny.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467652351">This may well have been brought up before (I&#39;m fairly new here and got <br/>
tired of clicking &quot;next&quot; when searching the archives to find out), but <br/>
my 8 year old daughter is really really enjoying &quot;The Number Devil: A <br/>
Mathematical Adventure&quot; by Hans Magnus Enzensberger.<br/>
<br/>
A quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you want to know something?  Most genuine mathematicians are bad at <br/>
sums. Besides, they have no time to waste on them.  That&#39;s what pocket <br/>
calculators are for. I assume you have one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sure, but we&#39;re not allowed to use them in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I see,&quot; said the number devil.  &quot;That&#39;s all right.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>
wrong with a little addition and subtraction. You never know when your <br/>
battery will die on you.  But mathematics, my boy, that&#39;s something <br/>
else again!&quot;<br/>

That does sound like a good book.  I just ordered it for me.  I got it for a<br/>
little over $4.  <br/>

This is so me.  Big number are all the same to me.  (and I was very good at<br/>
school math and I still like playing with numbers.)  When I heard about the<br/>
tsunami and all the people who were killed, 10,000 sounded like a lot and<br/>
now 150, 000 sounds like a lot, but I can&#39;t really quantify it so that I can<br/>
see how many people that is in my head.  I guess if I stopped to think about<br/>
it hard, maybe.  There are about 6.000 people in the biggest city near me.<br/>
So that would be more than 20 times the number of people in that city who<br/>
died.  Wow!<br/>

No, not tacky.  I understand.  When I try to recall large number of<br/>
something, I might say &quot;I think it was 10,000.no or maybe it was110,000, I<br/>
can&#39;t remember.&quot;  Those two numbers are so far apart, but it&#39;s hard for me<br/>
to quantify them when I am remembering what someone said.<br/>

My kids picked up that phrase from TV.  One of them used it last night,<br/>
talking to her stuffed animal.  I almost asked her if she could explain to<br/>
me what it meant, but I didn&#39;t.  I figured she was just lucky not to know.<br/>
I had forgotten about that tsk tsk finger thing.<br/>
