<div id="ygrps-yiv-451463641">I&#39;m trying to recall the title of a book I<br/>
read...mmm..about six months ago. The premise was a<br/>
point in the future in which people were so dependent<br/>
on corporations that employees took on the last name<br/>
of the company they worked for (ie: Sheila McDonald&#39;s<br/>
or Timothy Nike). One of the early scenes involves a<br/>
kid getting killed at the mall over some fancy<br/>
sneakers or something. I don&#39;t recall it in much<br/>
detail at the minute, but it had an interesting<br/>
premise that is related to a point I&#39;m trying to make<br/>
in one of my classes, and someone is wanting to read<br/>
it if I can recall the name of it. I&#39;m browsing Amazon<br/>
right now, but hoping someone else can think of it<br/>
before I find it. I think there was also something in<br/>
there about computers.<br/>
<br/>
TIA!<br/>
