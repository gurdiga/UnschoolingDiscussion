<div id="ygrps-yiv-756405891">Hello!  I&#39;m Shell, mom to 2 boys in So Cal who began officially <br/>
homeschooling a few weeks ago.  My oldest son just turned 5 and was <br/>
diagnosed with Autism 2.5 years ago.  He was in a full-day special <br/>
preschool for all of the past 2.5 years, with small breaks in the <br/>
summers.  At the time I felt that it was the best path for him, and <br/>
we were very fortunate to have a very loving and nurturing team of <br/>
teachers and therapists during the journey.  When I realized that we <br/>
were on the cusp of Kindergarten, my long-held ideas of homeschooling <br/>
and unschooling came back to life!  Drew is a very atypical autistic -<br/>
 very social, loving, talkative (my ears ring at day&#39;s end!), bright, <br/>
curious.  An incredible little guy. :)  It finally dawned on me that <br/>
I can absolutely homeschool him - I don&#39;t need specialists to guide <br/>
him on his path.  I *am* the specialist on Drew...and more to the <br/>
point, DREW is the specialist on Drew. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list for a few weeks, and have been reading <br/>
quite a bit at unschooling.com and Sanda&#39;s &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; site <br/>
for several months.  I&#39;m unlurking to intro myself and to request <br/>
some ideas and direction from the wise ones here. :)<br/>
<br/>
My ideas about unschooling were flimsy at best until recently.  I had <br/>
read some John Holt works about 6 years ago and thought, &quot;Now THAT is <br/>
how learning and living should be!&quot;  Then I started reading here and <br/>
the other mentioned sites, and my mind began to *really* open up.  <br/>
The control issues are killer for me, but make so so much sense.  <br/>
We&#39;re loosening up and it&#39;s so liberating. :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the part where I&#39;d like some ideas.  Drew is very interested <br/>
in the streets and freeways locally.  Living in Orange County, CA <br/>
there is no lack of freeways, lol!  I recently bought him some AAA <br/>
fold-out paper maps and they are on his bedroom wall.  He discovered <br/>
the Thomas Guide in the car today and was in heaven. :)  He knows all <br/>
the street names, where the freeway extrances/exits are and what <br/>
numbers they are.  <br/>
<br/>
Where would you suggest I go with this?  I&#39;m not trying to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
him anything, not trying to make this &quot;schooly&quot;.  Just trying to find <br/>
ways to feed his interest and possibly bring him ideas and <br/>
experiences that he wouldn&#39;t have known about otherwise.  I know this <br/>
should be relatively simple to do, but for some reason I just can&#39;t <br/>
get my creative juices going.  Blech.  I&#39;ve been in &quot;somebody-else-<br/>
stimulate-my-child&quot; mode for WAY too long, you know?  And running <br/>
after the 1yo baby makes keeping a string of coherent thought a <br/>
little tough, lol! :)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this turned into a bit of a novel, sorry about that.  I think I <br/>
just need some springboard-type thoughts to get me started.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Shell in So Cal<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770779283">Legoland is only an hour or so away and he can drive a lego car there - <br/>
it isn&#39;t on a track like at Disneyland - the kids are really driving <br/>
and have to follow traffic signs and signals and so on. Very cool ride. <br/>
They can also make cars out of legos and race them on ramps.<br/>
<br/>
You can take the train down there - maybe his interest in <br/>
transportation, etc., will extend to trains and train tracks - if it <br/>
does, that gives you a whole wonderful new area to explore together.<br/>
<br/>
There is a car race game called Mille Bornes - a card game. I LOVED it <br/>
when I was a kid. Might be a little bit old for him. There must be <br/>
other games out there that involve cars and roads and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
But - I wonder if he&#39;d like &quot;Rush Hour&quot; - the logic puzzle. It is aimed <br/>
at slightly older kids and adults - I really like it, myself, but maybe <br/>
with his interest, it&#39;d be cool for him and I think they have different <br/>
levels of play.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what it says on Amazon:<br/>
<br/>
Editorial Review<br/>
Honk! Honk! It&#39;s gridlock and the little red car can&#39;t move. The player <br/>
is a traffic cop in the Rush Hour Traffic Jam Puzzle where the <br/>
objective is to get the red car off the road. To play, pick one of 40 <br/>
challenge cards; solutions are printed on the back of each card. Then <br/>
set up the cars and buses in a specified pattern on the 6-inch-square <br/>
road grid. Move the vehicles one by one (obey those traffic laws!) <br/>
until the red car can escape the traffic jam. There are four levels of <br/>
difficulty. Kids can alternate turns with another player or just &quot;play <br/>
in traffic&quot; alone. The game from Binary Arts received a national award <br/>
from Mensa and is used in elementary school math classes. The design <br/>
includes clear instructions printed on the sturdy box, which can be <br/>
used both as a playing tray and for storage. The game cards stow away <br/>
in a drawer in the road grid. This is a 1999 Parents&#39; Choice <br/>
recommended toy. --Marcie Bovetz<br/>
<br/>
  Teacher Review<br/>
This variation on the traditional sliding-block puzzle is designed to <br/>
challenge sequential-thinking skills. As a child learns to play the <br/>
game, they will progress from a trial-and-error technique to a more <br/>
strategy-based method. Develops mathematical and spatial abilities, <br/>
too. --M. Sullivan, Amazon.com editor and former schoolteacher</div>

one of the world.  Get maps from other places.  Buy or borrow a CD-ROM <br/>
of maps.  If you (or a friend) has AAA insurance go to one of their <br/>
offices and you can get lots of different maps for free!  Go online to <br/>
the web sites of different state&#39;s governments -- they usually have a <br/>
link to request a free map of their state.  Here&#39;s the link for <br/>
Michigan:<br/>

You can look at maps online and/or order a free map.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I have always enjoyed laying on the floor with maps and just studying <br/>
them.  Really looking hard at them and &quot;discovering&quot; little streams, <br/>
forests and preserves, noticing what museums and landmarks that place <br/>
has and wondering what the people who live there are like.  I also <br/>
enjoy watching the Weather Channel to view the maps and see what kind <br/>
of weather people in other parts of the country or world are having and <br/>
what it&#39;s like to live there instead of here in lower MI.  Does he know <br/>
about that channel?<br/>
<br/>
On car trips I love to have a map to look at and it helps me to &quot;see&quot; <br/>
how far we&#39;ve gone and how far we have to go.  When I would ask &quot;how <br/>
long until we get there&quot; in the car I just actually wanted a time or <br/>
milage estimate -- not really because I was being impatient or <br/>
&#39;bratty&#39;.  I just wanted to get some info!  :)  Anyway, I can totally <br/>
understand your DS&#39;s fascination and enjoyment of maps!  Just give him <br/>
more stuff to play with and leave it up to him.<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to you for not getting in his way!  :)  Oh, which reminds me...I <br/>
just read a great article online this morning at Naomi Aldort&#39;s site of <br/>
that same idea.  It&#39;s called &quot;Getting Out of the Way&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Maybe someday they&#39;ll make their own unschooling sites, but they&#39;re all <br/>
pretty busy, and for now I&#39;m really glad they&#39;ve agreed to let me host their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He discovered <br/>
<br/>
the Thomas Guide in the car today and was in heaven. :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time I was in southern California on the day when one of the <br/>
homeschooling groups had a tour of the Thomas Brothers map company.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
if they&#39;ll take a single family on a tour, but I think that would fire his <br/>
map-joy!   Each of their pages is on a giant sheet and they update regularly so <br/>
when/if a page is republished it&#39;s all current.  They mark long-term <br/>
construction and roads-to-be-completed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He knows all <br/>
<br/>
the street names, where the freeway extrances/exits are and what <br/>
<br/>
numbers they are.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has asked lots of questions about Rt. 66 lately, and said yesterday <br/>
that she finally really gets what I&#39;m talking about, why sometimes it&#39;s Central <br/>
Ave.,  and sometimes the freeway, and then there&#39;s &quot;old 66&quot; alongside the <br/>
freeway in the canyon east of town.<br/>
<br/>
I got out a map of the U.S. showing freeways, and we talked about that.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a mall here that was built in the early 60&#39;s, near and at the time of <br/>
the freeway (I-40 through Albuquerque).  It&#39;s called Winrock, and one day <br/>
when I was there with Marty and Holly both, I was pointing out where the bank, <br/>
grocery store and drug store used to be.  The apartment buildings are still <br/>
there and very well maintained.  The hotel is still in business.  The mall has <br/>
changed, and no longer has a bank, grocery, pharmacy, bakery as it once had.  The <br/>
omni-whatever theatre (I forget the name of a three-projector, <br/>
three-angled-screen thing is used to be) is now a multiplex, still open.<br/>
<br/>
I reminded them of the Disneyesque visions of the cities of the future <br/>
they&#39;ve seen in books and at &quot;Tomorrowland,&quot; and that the idea was someone could <br/>
live in those apartments and walk to everything they would need.  For a while it <br/>
worked.<br/>
<br/>
That came up just because of questions about freeways.<br/>
<br/>
And the interstate system was designed and financed for the purpose of quick <br/>
troop movement in case something like WWII happened again.  One mile in five <br/>
is supposed to be straight so it can be used as a runway.   That&#39;s not much <br/>
discussed anymore.  Your son might be interested in some of that history, as it <br/>
comes along in his life.  Too much at once might not be fun, but as the <br/>
connections come along naturally, you might point them out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He has his whole life to make those connections.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of Rt. 66 research, photo-journalism kind of stuff you might <br/>
find at libraries or somewhere and let him see.  Where did it end up in <br/>
California?  Bakersfield, maybe?  Barstow?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe collecting (gradually, not in a frenzy &lt;g&gt;) photos of construction over <br/>
the years, of earthquake damage, stuff like that, would be fun for him.   But <br/>
if he only likes maps, there&#39;s a map dealer in Flagstaff who is wonderful and <br/>
helped us find some stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Few people have been as helpful and friendly to me as a stranger as he was <br/>
and I&#39;m definitely going to buy maps from him again.<br/>
<br/>
I think a single burning interest is as good a portal to the universe as <br/>
anything, and better than some.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s about Elvis.  But not &quot;about Elvis,&quot; about connections.    It&#39;s one of <br/>
the oldest pieces of my writing out there (that and the smaller bit about <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island).<br/>
<br/>
From <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/checklists">http://sandradodd.com/checklists</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-  Can one intense interest come to represent or lead to all others?  A mom <br/>
once complained that her son was interested in nothing but World War II.  <br/>
There are college professors and historians who are interested in nothing but <br/>
World War II.  It can become a life’s work.  But even a passing interest can <br/>
touch just about everything—geography, politics, the history and current events of <br/>
Europe and parts of the Pacific, social history of the 20th century in the <br/>
United States, military technology, tactics, recruitment and propaganda, poster <br/>
art/production/distribution, advances in communications, transport of troops <br/>
and food and supplies, espionage, prejudices, interment camps, segregation, <br/>
patriotism, music, uniforms, insignia, religion….<br/>
-=-<br/>
When someone really understands one war, he can easily understand another, <br/>
because he will have all the framework and questions in his mind.  When he <br/>
understands how countries are born, invaded, and how a government can die out, he <br/>
understands truths about all nations and civilizations.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think an interest in freeways can be a good starting framework.  It might <br/>
eventually connect to every other thing.  Some easy to see are commerce, <br/>
migration, engineering, federal expenditures/taxes/government, ecology, culture <br/>
(rush hours are why? work schedules are why?), physics (size and angle of exit <br/>
ramps and overpasses), safety (double fines zones), materials...<br/>

Mapquest with its &quot;zoom&quot; feature might be really fun.  You could look up the <br/>
address of a place you go a lot, your house, a friend&#39;s house, and then zoom <br/>
out gradually until the freeways show and you see the nearest freeway exit!  <br/>
And then maybe locate that &quot;square&quot; on another bigger map.<br/>

<br/>
Keith and I used to play a game with an atlas we had (when we were childless <br/>
and poor &lt;g&gt;) and I just showed it to Holly lately.  <br/>
<br/>
Get a manila file folder and on the fold, cut a circle (half a circle, like <br/>
cutting out a valentine, so that when you flatten it out it&#39;s a circle).<br/>
<br/>
Find a page in an atlas and put the circle over a part.  The other person <br/>
tries to figure out where it is.  If you can&#39;t get it you can slide the circle <br/>
over some.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were playing it with a book of maps of New Mexico and we had to <br/>
use other stuff to cover up what the folder didn&#39;t cover.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith used to identify his mostly by natural things--mountains and rivers.  I <br/>
did it more linguistically.  Lots of French names?  Indian names?   English <br/>
names?  <br/>
<br/>
That might work with freeway maps and Los Angeles, for older kids who&#39;re <br/>
reading better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466351355">We recently got the game Rush Hour and we are all addicted to it.  We&#39;ve<br/>
brought it to several friends and relatives houses and they have all loved<br/>
it too.  It was on my Want List for quite a while and I am glad I got it.<br/>
You can try it by playing it on line.  Here is a link.<br/>

enjoy the on-line version, but I prefer to have those little cars in my<br/>

buy it.  The company that makes it is called Binary Arts and they have lots<br/>
of neat logic games.   &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.binaryarts.com">http://www.binaryarts.com</a>&gt; www.binaryarts.com   Oh,<br/>
and I meant to say that the on-line version seems to get harder faster than<br/>
the plastic version.  Maybe it&#39;s just me because I think better with the<br/>
little plastic cars in my hands, but maybe not.  Anyway, glad to know that<br/>
there are expansion sets.  It&#39;ll keep us interested for a long time.  <br/>

I  reminded them of the Disneyesque visions of the cities of the future  <br/>
they&#39;ve seen in books and at &quot;Tomorrowland,&quot; and that the idea was someone  <br/>
could <br/>
live in those apartments and walk to everything they would  need.  For a <br/>
while it <br/>
worked<br/>

I saw a movie on Sundance channel the other day.  I think it was  called <br/>
&quot;Waydowntown&quot;, but don&#39;t quote me.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s about these 4 people who work in a high-rise office building  downtown.  <br/>
They live in downtown in apartments, nearby.  They made a  bet with each <br/>
other about who could stay inside the longest, by taking the  skyway bridges <br/>
between buildings to get from the office to their apartment to  the mall to <br/>
whatever.  Of course the plot takes all kinds of twists  and it&#39;s not for children, <br/>
but there were interesting characters.  <br/>

I play the Jumble puzzle in the newspaper.  There is an on-line version too.<br/>
Sometimes I can see the word instantly.  If I don&#39;t, I get out letter cubes<br/>
(from boggle or scrabble).  With the cubes, I sometimes see it right away,<br/>
but sometimes have to rearrange them until the word appears.  Somehow the<br/>
cubes make it easier to find the answer.<br/>

Boomers also has cars the kids can drive.  Some locations have only <br/>
the smaller cars for the kids... the kids and I went to one <br/>
recently, before school let out, where they also had full size go-<br/>
carts... whatever you call them.  Jay could ride with me while I <br/>
drove.  We were on the track so long going round and round that <br/>
Miranda got a vicious sunburn.  I swear they put us on the track and <br/>
forgot about us.  Nobody else was there.  No lines, no waiting, no <br/>
getting off the cars!  We ended up having to pull ourselves in when <br/>
we&#39;d had enough.  About half an hour!  We were joking as we drove <br/>
round passing each other -&quot;you can&#39;t get off the ride!  the ride <br/>
never ends!&quot;  fun and funny.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332968039">Wow, such a lot of great ideas!  I&#39;m still sifting through them all <br/>
and digesting each post, but wanted to send a broad &quot;thank you&quot; to <br/>
everyone for sharing - and in such detail. :)<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, I wanted to tell you that I have read the articles on <br/>
your site regarding special needs kiddos - those were the first ones <br/>
I read.  Beautiful writing, really gets to the heart of how I feel <br/>
about my son.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone!<br/>

then, I think, through Victorville to Needles. Not too long ago, the <br/>
town of Glendora changed the name of its main street (Alosta) back to <br/>
Route 66. There are lots of historic sites along the route - lots of <br/>
books and websites about it. Just google it.<br/>
