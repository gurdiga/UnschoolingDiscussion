        PRICELESS GIFTS<br/>
<br/>
1. The gift of listening...<br/>
Try giving this to someone in need.<br/>
And you must really listen.  No interrupting,<br/>
no daydreaming, no planning your responses.  Just listen.<br/>
<br/>
2. The gift of signs of affection...<br/>
Be generous with your hugs, kisses and<br/>
gentle squeezes of the hand.  Let these<br/>
tiny actions demonstrate the love inside of you.<br/>
<br/>
3. The gift of a note...<br/>
It can be as simple as &quot;I Love You&quot; or<br/>
as creative as a sonnet.  Put your notes<br/>
where they will surprise your loved ones.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The gift of laughter...<br/>
Just cut out a cartoon, save a clever article.<br/>
Your gift will say, &quot;I love to laugh with you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
5.  The gift of compliment...<br/>
A simple &quot;You look good in blue&quot; or &quot;Good supper&quot;<br/>
can be of greatest value to those who<br/>
may feel they are being taken for granted.<br/>
<br/>
6.  The gift of a favor...<br/>
Help with the dishes, run an errand, etc.<br/>
<br/>
7.  The gift of leaving alone...<br/>
There are times in our lives when we<br/>
want nothing better than to be left alone.<br/>
Become more sensitive to those times and give solitude.<br/>
<br/>
8.  The gift of a cheerful disposition...<br/>
Try to be cheerful around those you love.<br/>
<br/>
9.  The gift of a game...<br/>
Offer to play your loved one&#39;s favorite game.<br/>
Even if you lose, you&#39;ll be a winner.<br/>
<br/>
10.  The gift of prayer or positive thoughts...<br/>
Pray for your loved ones and<br/>
let them know you pray for them.<br/>
    or are simply thinking of them....<br/>
<br/>
