That kind of a time out sounds good to me!:)<br/>
<br/>
When I taught preschool and kindergarten we &quot;had&quot; to have a time-out chair <br/>
or corner, but I almost never (as in maybe two times per year) used them. <br/>
It always seemed a waste of time when the child could be re-directed to <br/>
something more fun to do.  At home, even now with my boys ages 10, 12, and <br/>
14, sometimes I&#39;ll say,  &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to your room?&quot; and they&#39;ll say <br/>
&quot;How come I&#39;m being punished?&quot; and I&#39;ll say, &quot;It isn&#39;t punishment and you <br/>
don&#39;t have to go there, but I thought you might like to play with something <br/>
or read or whatever instead of argue or fight.  I just want you to split up <br/>
for now.&quot;  Then they either go to their room or outside or ask if they can <br/>
go in my room or say &quot;We won&#39;t fight anymore, we&#39;re in the middle of a game&quot; <br/>
and I say, &quot;Okay.&quot;  That&#39;s as close to the negative &quot;time-outs&quot; as we get <br/>
anymore.  It seems to bring peace.  I think when they were younger they <br/>
needed more direct help, as in &quot;Would you like to do _____ with me? [Fill in <br/>
the blank with &quot;go outside&quot; &quot;play a game&quot; &quot;make something&quot; &quot;watch a <br/>
video/movie/TV&quot; etc.].  Now that they&#39;re older they can usually decide on <br/>
something to do for themselves, though I still offer to do something with <br/>
them if they want.<br/>
