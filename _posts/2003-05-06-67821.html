<div id="ygrps-yiv-589799123">Someone send me an email today about some Teddy Bear Virus.<br/>
It tells you to do a search on your computer for a file if it is there delete <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
Dont delete it! <br/>
<br/>
That file is part of your windows operating system. I asked AOL and they say <br/>
it is a hoax. I almost did it.<br/>
I do not normally send stuff like this but this one is almost believable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One reason that one is so believable is that there *is* a teddy bear virus<br/>
out there.  I forget what it&#39;s called.  The file mentioned in this hoax<br/>
actually has an icon that looks like a teddy bear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, Aol said it is called the Teddy Bear Virus. They said that the gray <br/>
teddy that is found on a computer is part of the windows operating system. I <br/>
have been told by AOL that the Teddy Bear Virus is a hoax. I had my three <br/>
gray teddy&#39;s ready to delete im glad I asked them I came soo close to pushing <br/>
that button. Fewh.....<br/>
