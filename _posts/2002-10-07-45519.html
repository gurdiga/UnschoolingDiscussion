<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590324871">You know, I felt the same as both of you for a long time. I had my two boys that were only 17 mths apart, and they were at the age where we could do a lot of things together. The diaper stage was over, they were both potty trained, no more naps or early bedtimes, used good enough manners we could go anywhere and do anything. Then came our little surprise baby. I have to say, it&#39;s been easier than I ever dreamed! The boys are closer to each other, and more loving to me. They have matured quite a bit, and I have not had either of them upset or put out by me having to take time with the baby. They want to do anything and everything they can with and for her. They spend more time in the living room with us instead of playing in their rooms, they watch less TV and read books to her instead. They&#39;ve quit asking for all the neatest and newest toys they see and concentrate on finding household things to turn into toys for her. They offer to share their food with her, when before they&#39;d have a fit at the thought of sharing food with anyone. And one of the best things - if she&#39;s fussy or unhappy for me, they can cheer her up and have her giggling in a heartbeat! Yeah, I&#39;m definitely sleep-deprived, I have to wash a load of diapers twice a week, and we have to be more careful where we put things like spare change and glasses full of drink - but nothing can replace those wide-open-mouth slobbery baby kisses. Every day I thank God  because I am soooo glad of our little &quot;mistake&quot;, or I may never have gotten the courage up to have another. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; For the longest time I thought that I wanted 3 children.  Now that I<br/>
  &gt; have two, I am strongly believing more and more every day that 2 is my<br/>
  &gt; personal limit.  I love my children with everything in me.  I spend<br/>
  &gt; practically 24 hours a day with them and I treasure every second (even<br/>
  &gt; those hard ones).  However, I am realistic.  My children wear me out.<br/>
  &gt; My children cost A LOT!  There are times with two when I am home alone<br/>
  &gt; that I cannot physically meet both of their needs.  How would I do this<br/>
  &gt; with more than what I have?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yes, I feel the same way about the 2 boys that I have (who are 9 & 11). I am<br/>
  SO glad to have them and it&#39;s such a wonderful experience watching them grow<br/>
  up and sharing life with them. BUT, I also know that I would have a hard<br/>
  time having another one or two or three (yikes!) children. I would become a<br/>
  physical wreck, I think. I would end up really resenting being a mom and I<br/>
  think it would take all the joy out of motherhood for me, personally. Having<br/>
  babies was an awesome experience but NOBODY could talk me into having more.<br/>
  Sleepless nights, feeling like a zombie, more mouths to feed, diapers,<br/>
  etc... no thanks, I&#39;m done. I am thankful that those days are behind me.<br/>
<br/>
  Does that make me a bad, selfish mother? I don&#39;t know but I just really love<br/>
  and appreciate the life we have right now. Our &quot;little&quot; family unit is just<br/>
  perfect, IMO. OTOH, if I were to get pregnant by accident at this point, I<br/>
  *would* embrace my new baby - I just wouldn&#39;t do it if I had a choice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt; I love seeing happy and healthy large families.  Those that are<br/>
  &gt; fulfilled seem SO fulfilled.  I envy them.  I look at them and see<br/>
  &gt; children that aren&#39;t as demanding as mine and I think that perhaps that<br/>
  &gt; is HOW their parents were capable of being good parents to the number of<br/>
  &gt; children in their family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Me too. When I see a mom with a large family, I truly respect and honor her<br/>
  for having whatever it takes (that I don&#39;t have) to raise those kids. More<br/>
  power to her and her husband. It&#39;s a wonderful thing, I&#39;m sure. Just not for<br/>
  me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949683335">Oh, Karin, she is wonderful!!! Yes, I&#39;m already amazed at the difference in the genders! If you really want to have second thoughts, try what I did early into my pregnancy: I had a friend&#39;s baby over every now and then. When the boys were delighted instead of jealous, it made me feel a lot better! If your boys are jealous or resentful of the time you have to spend with the little one, then you&#39;ll know that adding another right now probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea! :-)<br/>

  Myranda, your little daughter sounds wonderful! It sounds like she is the<br/>
  missing piece to the puzzle of your family. :-) And you get to experience<br/>
  raising a girl after the 2 boys - something I often wonder about myself<br/>
  (having 2 boys). But, as tempting as it may be to have another one, I still<br/>
  think two&#39;s our limit when there&#39;s a choice involved. You definitely got me<br/>
  having second thoughts, though. :o)<br/>

guarantee that we would have a girl, dh would go for it in a second.<br/>
I do feel sorry for my MIL (who is a wonderful mil)...she had two<br/>
boys, really wanted a little girl. Was hoping for a granddaughter,<br/>
but doesn&#39;t look like it will happen. She is fine with that, but it <br/>
would have been nice for her....<br/>
