She&#39;s got an artists eye.....anyone can learn how to, but it seems to be <br/>
easier for some folks.<br/>
It&#39;s a way to revert back to the awe with which a toddler sees the world.<br/>

&lt;&lt; And hey, the best hair<br/>
 stylists and makeup artists in the world are men! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hey, that&#39;s gender bias!! There are some dang good women too...<br/>
It&#39;s funny though, the guys at the store I work at have quite a <br/>
following...and I&#39;ve seen the makeovers they do and mine are better.<br/>
Women think that if a guy is doing makeup, he&#39;s automatically really good <br/>
(otherwise why would a guy do it right? ) but that isn&#39;t always true.<br/>
I have to say, Kevin Aucoin was a miracle worker with makeup, I am sad that <br/>
there won&#39;t be anymore of his books...(he died a couple months ago) we all <br/>
learned a lot from him in the cosmetic world.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t following this thread but just caught this bit now. Had to just <br/>
jump in and say that my husbands cousin is a makeup artist in Hollywood. She <br/>
has been for years and has been up for 2 emmys from two different shows. She <br/>
currently works on Alias. What a job she has!!! Her husband is a camera man <br/>
on Six Feet Under.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know. I was just trying to worm my way out of a bad idea I gave Tuck,<br/>
thinking that Camp Fire was just for girls. And I think she suggested<br/>
gender bias the other way, when I posted the idea of the girls doing<br/>
make-overs. I just can&#39;t win, can I????&lt;grin&gt;<br/>
