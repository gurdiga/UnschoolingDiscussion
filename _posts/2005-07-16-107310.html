<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193467635">In the interest of maybe helping people see that even scary medical<br/>
situations can still be handled with respect and the minimum of coercion, as<br/>
well as with the idea that maybe some folk can learn from my horrid<br/>
mistakes, I am writing a long saga about Jayn�s current experience with an<br/>
incipiently life threatening infection in her mouth. In the interests of<br/>
ease and the gentle reader�s sanity, I will make it a few installments.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In March I wrote the following in response to a question (on UD) about<br/>
enforcing tooth brushing:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I would rather Jayn had some cavities in her teeth than there be a<br/>
gaping, festering hole of my creating in our relationship. I have never<br/>
enforced tooth brushing. She is 5, and her teeth did start to come in<br/>
&quot;late&quot;, at one year. Of course she sees me and dh brushing, and we have gone<br/>
through a lengthy process of finding toothpastes that she likes the taste<br/>
of. She is also aware of the one large cavity she has in a molar. Rather<br/>
than express the inaccurate information that brushing *will* prevent<br/>
cavities, I tell her that brushing is more likely to mean fewer cavities, as<br/>
well as fresher breath. She also knows that it will be more important to<br/>
brush more often when her adult teeth come in. She has recently<br/>
spontaneously begun brushing her teeth several times a day, rotating through<br/>
her selection of fun toothbrushes, and sometimes flossing. This is actually<br/>
unnecessary as her baby teeth are wide apart. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have taken visiting the dentist very gradually. Six months ago she came<br/>
with me to my cleaning, and wanted to sit in the chair and &quot;get her teeth<br/>
counted&quot;. She asked a lot of questions. Now I am on a quest to find a nice,<br/>
gentle, lady dentist (Jayn wants a woman) who uses air abrasion when<br/>
possible, instead of drilling. We will be interviewing and choose the person<br/>
Jayn likes best, and she is looking forward to the visits.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ten days ago, on Tuesday night, Jayn developed an abscess in the tooth with<br/>
the large cavity. The condition is called facial cellulitis and is<br/>
characterized by swelling in her cheek near the tooth and some pain. I am<br/>
sure the abscess was in her gum sooner, but this is when we discovered its<br/>
presence.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Naturally our immediate alarm caused us (dh and I) to step up my far too<br/>
relaxed timetable for finding a congenial dentist and we made an appointment<br/>
on Wednesday for Thursday with a dental office that had been recommended by<br/>
another Unschooler as being kind and kid friendly. We explained to Jayn that<br/>
we were very concerned, and that she had an infection, and she was very<br/>
willing to go to a dentist. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here�s what has happened since:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
At this first place Jayn, being willing and ready, immediately sat in the<br/>
chair and allowed three different people to work in her mouth. The Assistant<br/>
polished her teeth with the rubber tip and the sucker, did a fluoride<br/>
treatment and took a full set of x-rays plus one other one of the bad tooth.<br/>
The Hygenist then came in and scraped her teeth with the big old hook tool<br/>
(Jayn said it made her teeth feel itchy). Then the Dentist came in and<br/>
examined her teeth and the x-rays, recommending urgent extraction, and<br/>
antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately (although it turns out that fate had an even better outcome<br/>
for us � stand by for the happy ending in a while) the regular dentist, who<br/>
had been much recommended, was away. None of the three of us really liked<br/>
the stand in dentist much - she was brusque, had a hurried manner, looking<br/>
more at the x-rays than in Jayn&#39;s mouth. We didn&#39;t get a reassuring or<br/>
caring vibe from her, unlike the other staff in the place. She also found a<br/>
fair amount of other work needed, but much of that is not visible to the<br/>
eye, between Jayn�s teeth.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless Jayn wanted to return to the same office later anyway because<br/>
she really liked the dental assistant, who was delightful, and quite liked<br/>
the hygienist. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn was an incredibly brave little trooper, even with the x-rays and<br/>
getting her teeth polished and scraped by the hygienist. She answered all<br/>
their questions about brushing and flossing and I could tell that she was<br/>
really comfortable with the DA because she started sharing her &quot;sky is<br/>
falling&quot; fantasy with her. James was actually more nervous than Jayn once it<br/>
came to the crunch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The only difficulty was that they do not do any of this kind of extraction<br/>
or anesthesia work at this office, only fillings with nitrous oxide, so they<br/>
referred us to an Oral Surgeon. This was disappointing � more on that later.<br/>
They also gave us a prescription for an antibiotic. This began to work and<br/>
the swelling started to recede at once. We made an appointment for the<br/>
following Monday with their recommended guy at 7am. (First mistake!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
*****************************************<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well the Monday was a disaster, and the saga continues.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn being on nights was already stressed, tired and extremely hungry (in<br/>
preparation for the sedation) by the time we got to the oral surgeon at 7am.<br/>
I had hoped that she would simply be willing to drink the versed and snooze.<br/>
No. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unlike the first dental establishment, this place was very clinical in<br/>
atmosphere, and the old guy, who you would have thought would be avuncular,<br/>
was not careful, slow or patient in his approach. Some of his first words<br/>
were &quot;Stop crying&quot; and he tried to pull Jayn&#39;s hands from in front of her<br/>
mouth. This was before any sedation. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When it was immediately evident that James and I were not going to support<br/>
holding her down at all, he went off to get the Versed. Now Jayn will<br/>
usually undertake some ministration or take her medicine if given enough<br/>
time, and patient waiting, so we were ready to wait, except that instead of<br/>
becoming calmer and more willing, Jayn got increasingly agitated every time<br/>
she tried to taste the stuff. I took some on my finger, and it is truly<br/>
awful and foul smelling. She just couldn&#39;t stomach it, although bless her<br/>
she really did try.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The doctor kept looking in to see how it was going. James tried a syringe to<br/>
offer the stuff. The nurse that James described as a &quot;battleaxe&quot; said to<br/>
him, &quot;Let us go in there and we&#39;ll make her take it&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is not how we live, as you all know. BTW I did come to realize what my<br/>
biggest error was at this point, but in the interests of chronology I�ll<br/>
tell you later and you can have fun guessing what that might be.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we finally left there, feeling rather disappointed, went to get some<br/>
food, and then went home to sleep at about 9.30am.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We rose at 1.00pm in order to visit the back up oral surgeon that James had<br/>
also made an appointment with, through a referral from one of our friend&#39;s<br/>
dentists. This second person is one who will bring in an anesthesiologist,<br/>
something that I saw being recommended a lot on the Very Young Kids Teeth<br/>
list for IV sedation. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This man was also not impressed with our evident refusal to back up the<br/>
force tactics that seem to be the first option, rather than last resort,<br/>
with these people.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 He gave me the distinct impression that he was really just too busy to take<br/>
the time needed for Jayn to get comfortable and brushed the surgery off as<br/>
taking 15 minutes. Apparently he would schedule that small amount of time<br/>
(although the office was empty when we arrived.) One of the sticking points<br/>
is this oral dose of Versed - and everyone seems entirely unwilling to just<br/>
give Jayn a quick shot and let her gently fall asleep in our arms. It is as<br/>
if they *want* to create a traumatic experience of being overpowered in the<br/>
child. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The dentist also resorted to a strategy that seems to be typical amongst<br/>
Western medical practitioners of scare tactics - expressing the worst case<br/>
scenario in tones of doom, and exaggerated urgency. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now I have already researched the infection that Jayn has, as confirmed by<br/>
the dentist, and I know that left untreated  it is very likely to become a<br/>
life threatening infection requiring hospitalization - after it migrates<br/>
into the jaw or eye socket. However we are not leaving it untreated (she<br/>
*is* taking antibiotics - a necessary step also in reducing her pain and to<br/>
allow the anesthesia to work) and a couple of days or a week will not<br/>
suddenly plunge her into a life threatening situation.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He rather rudely brushed us off with advice to go to UCLA School of<br/>
Pediatric Dentistry, but couldn&#39;t give us any names of personnel - even of<br/>
his professor apparently. Then he said &quot;I&#39;ll be right back&quot;, left the room<br/>
and sent in the secretary with Jayn&#39;s x-ray and a post in note with the<br/>
words &quot;UCLA School of Pediatric Dentistry&quot; written on it (as if we were too<br/>
stupid to remember those words) and no phone number. When James asked about<br/>
the number in astonishment, she suggested we try the Yellow Pages!!! The<br/>
dentist didn&#39;t even say good bye and good luck or anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we came home. James got on the phone. I got on the internet and the<br/>
upshot of it is that we have an appointment with the lady that another local<br/>
unschooler recommends (did I mention that part of the problem is that Jayn<br/>
still wants all her dental folk to be women?) who *sounded* wonderful. She<br/>
originally was going to squeeze us in on Thursday, but called and changed it<br/>
to tomorrow, Wednesday when she will have a lot more time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are told she plays with the kids until they are comfortable, and prefers<br/>
local anesthetic. The only fly in the ointment is the early hour of the<br/>
appointment - 10.30am. Jayn is seeing this as a meeting appointment, with<br/>
the possibility of doing the extraction if she feels comfortable. If she is<br/>
not willing, we may have to wait two weeks while the dentist goes on<br/>
vacation. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to make it clear that James speaks at length to any prospective<br/>
practitioner � he is much better at that than I am. He explains our<br/>
parenting philosophy and asks questions about how child friendly they are.<br/>
We must be using the same words but have different meanings for them because<br/>
even the concept of Patience seems to be differently defined by health<br/>
professionals.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Stand by for Part Two�..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104171813">Jonathan had an abcess but we have a great pediatric dentist so the<br/>
experience was much different.  They gave him nitrous oxide and<br/>
novacaine but it didn&#39;t deaden the nerve, we later discovered that<br/>
both his father and uncle had the same experience.  Novacaine and gas<br/>
have no effect on them.<br/>
<br/>
The dentist drilled to the point of the nerve and stopped when<br/>
Jonathan told him it hurt.  He believed him and stopped, he said that<br/>
we could take him to an oral surgeon and have it pulled but that it<br/>
may be fine just left open like it was.  He explained that since it&#39;s<br/>
open it can&#39;t build up pressure but that the nerve might be irritated,<br/>
if it became too painful we could just have it pulled.<br/>
<br/>
That was over a year ago and although he will experience pain once in<br/>
a while if he forgets and bites down on that tooth, it has been<br/>
basically painless.  The dentist says that it will just fall out<br/>
someday, right before the new tooth comes in.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think most dentists would have gone with this but since our&#39;s<br/>
puts the feelings of the child first he has more solutions.<br/>
