Ok, how many of us have the over-powering urge to just slap this guy??? I<br/>
know<br/>
I do, or at least shake him up a bit?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I do, but I wouldn&#39;t waste my time on him. Some people just won&#39;t<br/>
change their opinion or open their mind. *shrug* I don&#39;t think he&#39;s much of<br/>
a &quot;threat&quot; -- it&#39;s only one editorial with no evidence to support the<br/>
claims. ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
