Go to the health food store and get homeopathic Arnica 30X (or 30c) and Symphytum 30X (or 30c). If it&#39;s inflammed and feels bruised, give the arnica (two pellets) every couple hour until it feels better. Try to avoid any other painkillers. If if&#39;s too painful, give the arnica more frequently. Then you can give the symphytum (two pellets) twice a day for a few days, to speed up the process of healing.<br/>
If you can&#39;t find the symphytum, give her comfrey tea, or email me if you have any questions.<br/>

So, if anyone with broken bones (current or past) has any ideas on how to<br/>
help her feel better, or help her manage live one-armed, or medications I<br/>
should ask for (I have fioricet for my migaines, which I&#39;m tempted to<br/>
give her next time) I&#39;d love to hear them.<br/>
