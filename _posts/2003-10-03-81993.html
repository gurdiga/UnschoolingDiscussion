<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018523427"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you worry about your children, make an effort to be around other <br/>

up okay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where does one find these? I should mention that the vast majority of my<br/>
city is made up of those &quot;fundamentalist Christian Homeschoolers&quot; ya&#39;ll<br/>
have been back and forth about. In fact, I&#39;ve never even met a<br/>
homeschooler in my city that didn&#39;t homeschool for religious reasons and<br/>
our local organization (and fair cooridinators) are all of the same<br/>
mindset. I&#39;m so glad that I had the computer! If it weren&#39;t for a bunch<br/>
of great women who couldn&#39;t see that I was wearing a denim skirt and<br/>
spoke to my mind/words instead, I&#39;d probably be still desperately trying<br/>
to get out of my box. I&#39;m not practiced in knowing how to find real life<br/>
women outside the box..... where to start?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Start you own on-line unschoolers group. I did that (and it turned into an <br/>
international conference! &lt;G&gt; I had 350 of my closest virtual unschooling <br/>
buddies descend on me one weekend! &lt;G&gt;). <br/>
<br/>
I talked a couple of NC unschoolers into doing it---and within a WEEK, they <br/>
had 49 unschoolers on their list!  The Greenville unschoolers did it----and <br/>
hosted a picnic in the mountains this past Tuesday----FIFTEEN unschooling <br/>
families showed up---SOOOO COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Post the info about your new e-list on all state/city-wide e-lists. Put up <br/>
flyers at the local food co-op, natural food store,libraries---places YOU hang <br/>
out and places where unschoolers might hang out.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan it, they will come!<br/>

<br/>
I met one unschooler in my town group where I just moved to.  She had been an unschooler in the beginning but as her kids got older she began assimilating into the school-at-home group and became more eclectic.  I knew she was an unschooler-at-heart by the way she talked so I asked her about it. She never goes on the internet so she had no other unschoolers near her so she&#39;s glad I am in the group now. <br/>
<br/>
I met a second unschooler in the video store here.  I saw her get out of a van that was painted like tie dye so that peaked my curiosity about her.  I saw her looking at movies with her probably 8 or 9 year old daughter wrapped around her waist.  I knew for sure then that she was one of us.  I approached her and asked her if she was an unschooler.  She was (of course).  Unfortunately she was in the process of moving to another state because it would have been cool to get to know her.  BTW, it was her kids who painted her van.  She bought a whole bunch of spray paint and let them do it.<br/>

  Janis, you&#39;re in RI, too?  I think because of your screen name (Coyote) I thought you lived somewhere out west.  We really need to do a southern New England unschool day since there are so many of us.  It&#39;s getting so cold.  Where would we go?<br/>

      I&#39;m sorry Cris, I was talking about locally.  You live too far away.  How have you been?  One day we&#39;ll have a second car and we&#39;ll get together.<br/>
<br/>
      For everyone else:  Yes, I met Cris, an unschooler, while looking for a ride to the conference.  She answered my post and we carpooled down there.  If it wasn&#39;t for her generosity, I would have never made it there.  She&#39;s really cool, too.  We found a great radio station on the way home and we sang at the top of our lungs while stuck in traffic.  <br/>
