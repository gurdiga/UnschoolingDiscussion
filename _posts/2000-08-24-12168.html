&lt;&lt; I remember what my son was like at 3!  <br/>
 WOW!!  I was ready to call social services to have this kid evaluated.  I <br/>
 really thought that he had some kind of &quot;disorder&quot;  He grew out of it and as <br/>
 I reflect, I really think that it had to do with him dealing with his anger <br/>
 over his new sibling.  I honestly don&#39;t think the jealously really hit until <br/>
 she showed signs of being a &quot;person&quot;.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, you mean my dd could really be just behaving normal for a 3yr <br/>
old.......hee hee.....you mean, I shouldn&#39;t call and have her <br/>
evaluated!!!!&lt;gasp&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for behavior problems, when my dd acts out, I tell her that if she can&#39;t <br/>
behave appropiately then she is telling me she needs to be by herself for <br/>
awhile....then I help her to her room.  I let her know that when she is ready <br/>
to be kind (behave appropiately a.k.a not hitting, smashing her brothers head <br/>
into the floor, putting out her feet to trip him, or taking his toys ) then <br/>
she can rejoin us.....this seems to work.  Although some days it takes <br/>
several trips to the bedroom before she realizes I am serious.<br/>
<br/>
We also do prevention, prevention, prevention, as much as possible...like <br/>
eating often, as much sleep as they are willing to do, tons of attention <br/>
(although sometimes we just get to busy in our day to day living to remember <br/>
to stop and do focus play.  Believe me, she acts out when we have been going <br/>
to much and need a couple of days just at home to rest.)<br/>
<br/>
I love to read so here are some of my favorite parenting books which I have <br/>
to re-read often:<br/>
Love and Anger- great when I am letting my buttons being    pushed.<br/>
Love and Limit- good for working through behavior   &quot;problems&quot;.  It is more <br/>
like a 48 pg workbook.  This is the     book that told me 3yr are trying to <br/>
figure out and obtain   power in their enviroment (which cleared up tons for <br/>
me)<br/>
The Discipline Book by Dr Sears<br/>
Kids are Worth it!<br/>
Raising your Spirited Child- this is one of my most favorites!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
