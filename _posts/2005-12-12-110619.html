Don&#39;t forget that they each have to have a copy of the game, too, in<br/>
order to play together using the wi-fi feature.  <br/>
<br/>
*I* got my own DS this year too, as an early Christmas present, of the<br/>
MarioKart DS, which is bright santa-sleigh red :-) and my favorite<br/>
game, Animal Crossing, for the DS.  I am totally happy.<br/>
<br/>
The DS also plays GBA games, so my pokemon games are in one side and<br/>
the DS games are in the other and I am crazy happy to know it is in my<br/>
pocket whenever I am bored in a checkout line or waiting at the dr.&#39;s<br/>
or waiting in the car until my DD gets off work.<br/>

year), but she might get her own set of keys to the cars we do have. <br/>
She is also getting a calligraphy set and a jewelry making tool kit,<br/>
and a gift card to Michael&#39;s craft shop, her own copy of Animal<br/>
Crossing DS so we can play together, and a furby.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew, 14, is getting 6 new G.A. Henty books, a copy of Gods &<br/>
Generals, an electric razor, a couple of XBox games, and some other<br/>
incidentals.  His sister bought him a ninja sword set at the anime<br/>
convention, so I am letting her have the honor of giving him &quot;the best<br/>
gift ever&quot; this year.<br/>

Aaron, age 7, is getting Napoleon Dynamite Mad Libs, a doodle monster,<br/>
some lego sets, a couple video games, some Spawn action figures, and a<br/>
cotton candy machine.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m having fun noticing my different approach, since converting to  <br/>
&gt; radical unschooling, to gift-giving for my kids this year. In year&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; past I tried carefully to balance their heart&#39;s desires with what I  <br/>
&gt; deemed appropriate and valuable(financially, morally,  <br/>
&gt; educationally).  This year, I&#39;m finding so much joy indulging their  <br/>
&gt; greatest wishes (within my financial constraints -- can&#39;t afford that  <br/>
&gt; digital video-camera... yet).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chris,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to add that I totally know what you are talking about. <br/>
The joy in gift giving is so much MORE now, knowing that what they are<br/>
going to be given is exactly where their interests lay (lay? lie? can<br/>
never get that one right).<br/>
<br/>
The last few years, the years we have been totally unschooling, have<br/>
been such a wonderful adventure of finding just the most awesomest<br/>
gifts so that they would know that we take their interests seriously<br/>
and enjoy them too.  I think it has been really healing for all of us<br/>
after the years of &quot;educational&quot; gifts and such.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken it even a step further this year, and finally feel free<br/>
enough to allow someone else (my daughter) to have the coveted<br/>
spotlight of being the one who has come up with the coolest gift ever.<br/>
 She got her brother a set of ninja swords at the anime convention,<br/>
something he has been asking and asking for, and I am so going to<br/>
enjoy watching her give it to him and her receive the &quot;glow&quot; this year.<br/>
<br/>
I almost blew it, and realized at the last minute that if I &quot;topped&quot;<br/>
her gift with something even more cool, it would steal that feeling<br/>
from her, and she might not put such effort into it ever again.<br/>
<br/>
It is so neat to see them start to really care about each other&#39;s<br/>
interests, and really want to give something that the other will<br/>
*really* like.<br/>

<br/>
****<br/>
  This year, Andy wants a few very specific Transformers, and a few very specific (and very expensive) yugioh cards.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Dan has just spent the last month saying &quot;I want that!&quot; to every non-girl toy commercial on TV! &lt;g&gt;  High on his list are Play-doh doggie doctor, a new hula hoop (hard to find at Xmas time), whack-a-mole, flywheel cars, another recycling truck, and any remote control car.  Dan also loves maps, of all kinds and sizes, so Gary is stopping by AAA this week to pick up a collection of regional/state maps for his stocking.<br/>
   <br/>
  Will has said nothing about what he wants so likely it will be gift cards for CD/books, clothes and more gift cards. <br/>
   <br/>
  As well, we&#39;re thinking of giving Andy a new TV with close captioning, since he loves being able to read what was said/sung.  I think they could use and would enjoy personal CD players, which will mean buying some CD&#39;s for Andy & Dan.  <br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;re also getting a DVD/VCR for a family gift, so I&#39;ll pick up a few DVD&#39;s I know they would love to have.  <br/>

<br/>
We have an old wooden slingshot out on the woodpile.  It came up in  <br/>
the yard trash one day.  It&#39;s so old and dried up I&#39;m sure it would  <br/>
break if someone really put the rubber bands in it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid someone (my neighbor or my cousin or someone) had a  <br/>
really fancy fiberglass or nylon slingshot.  It was amber colored,  <br/>
and see-through.  I&#39;m thinking maybe it was made by Wham-O (not a  <br/>
help in NZ, probably, but Americans might remember).<br/>
<br/>
Keith has a suede sling he made when he was a kid, a David-and- <br/>
Goliath type of thing, where you hold both ends of a strip of leather  <br/>
with a rock halfway down, swing it around and let go of one end.  I  <br/>
played with it a little and it&#39;s a hard trick to get, but Keith still  <br/>
knows how from hours of play as a kid.<br/>

Listen openly to your child&#39;s ideas.<br/>

validation, gentle instruction, and humor.<br/>
Gentle guidance is best.<br/>
No child was ever spoiled by too much love.<br/>

Try whispering if your words aren&#39;t heard.<br/>
Believe in your child&#39;s good intentions.<br/>
Children reflect the treatment they receive.<br/>

New cell  phones all around.  The boys want the Razor phone (and are getting <br/>
them) my  oldest dd wants the ROKR phone which is like an ipod and a phone and <br/>
she&#39;s  getting that.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The younger more interested in labels than gadgets child wants a Dooney  and <br/>
Bourke watch that is big and sparkly and she&#39;s getting that and a fur lined  <br/>
hoodie and lots of other clothes that she asked for in her letter to  Santa.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
There is everything from bookshelves for my oldest daughters apartment to  <br/>
football tickets in their letters to Santa.<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of store clerks get a kick out of my shopping with these long letters  <br/>
with lists to Santa that seem like &quot;grown up&quot; wishes then they find out they <br/>
are  mostly grown and they love it.<br/>
 <br/>
My son even threw in a  comical &quot;Christmas porn&quot; request in his  letter, just <br/>
to see if we were really reading them!  A guy was reading over  my shoulder <br/>
in line yesterday and almost wet himself laughing so hard.  He  said out loud, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry but I was reading that Santa letter you  have there and was feeling <br/>
sorry for the kid that asks for BIC pens but the  next line really got me&quot;.  <br/>
About half way down it starts going into; socks,  Bic pens, Christmas porn, <br/>
and then goes back to &quot;normal&quot; stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
Some parents would probably be shocked and not so appreciative but I knew  it <br/>
was just Matthew being Matthew and his silliness (he&#39;s 25 btw).<br/>

  That is too funny that your son asked for Christmas Porn! Even better that he has a mom that can appreciate the joke. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  A few weeks back, Darin was home and we were up late (for us) watching Saturday Night Live. There was a skit done commercial style for a Girl&#39;s Gone Wild video. The Video was called Girls Gone Wild Katrina. We laughed so hard, and it gave me my idea for our gag gift exchange that the adults in my family do after the kids are in bed. <br/>
   <br/>
  My folks had homes in Gulf Port, Mississippi, New Orleans, and in a suburban town outside Baton Rouge. The only one left is the one outside (north of) Baton Rouge in Zachary. So for my Dad I made up a video cover called Girls Gone Wild Katrina, my brother got Girls... East Topeka (only funny if you live there), my Brother in law got Girls... Amish (they live in PA) and Darin got Girls... Truck Stops. I&#39;m sure I violated copyright laws doing that, but had fun anyway. I *borrowed* a picture online of a girl with her shirt up and stars over her boobs, standing in knee deep water for my Dad&#39;s cover. One of an Amish woman bending over to pick up laundry for my BIL&#39;s cover. A toothless, hickish girl for my brother. And for Darin I found a picture of a huge fat man with stomach hanging out under his shirt, grease stains on his shirt and hat... The absolute works! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Glad to send some inspiration to someone today. &lt;g&gt; As for my folks... well lets just say that losing them wasn&#39;t a hardship by any stretch. Not anything by any comparison to what so many others went through. The house they still have is way too much. Now my Dad acts as if he lost the world... There is a shanty town (for lack of a better word) down the road from them. (Way down the road, but when I heard about it, before I saw it, I thought it was right down the road, like next door down the road.) And my Dad has no compassion. The people there are living in fifth wheels. (campers that hitch to pick up trucks, nice but still not a home) And he has no compassion. He makes statements like *look what they get to live in! The government is spoiling these people, the way the government is supporting them is a step up from where they were living before...* and worse. When my sister pointed out his logic all he said was *but I lost the other two houses, you don&#39;t see me getting handouts.*<br/>
 I just shake my head. There is absolutely no sense arguing that kind of ignorance. He is a great grandpa, and he would give a stranger the shirt off his back, but the rest of us would hear about it and the way he would tell it you would think he gave the stranger a new wardrobe from Saks and shoes from Prada. So honestly don&#39;t feel bad. :o( <br/>

Oh I can&#39;t wait to hand out the gifts this year!! <br/>
Hannah, 9, was very easy to buy for - I got her another Bratz doll and a <br/>
doggy, some art supplies and the biggie **her own guitar** It&#39;s a 3/4 <br/>
size with all the instructional schtuff and two mentors lined up to <br/>
guide her along!  Hayden, 7, is getting his own Game Cube (mommy will be <br/>
getting the Donkey Konga game from Santa ;) and gift certificates for a <br/>
store with used games, Star Wars figures to add to our collection, some <br/>
Green Day, and the Stewie Movie (Family Guy). <br/>
At the beginning of the holiday discussion/list making, Hayden asked for <br/>
an X-box, Halo 2 and XBox Live (don&#39;t know where he got that idea! <br/>
&lt;VBG&gt;) and Hannah asked for a DS with Nintendogs... Financially, way out <br/>
of my league (at least at the Christmas crunch time), but we compromised <br/>
and will scour pawn shops during January and Februrary to see who had <br/>
sacrificed their gifts (or, as with the x-box, is dumping the old <br/>
technology for the new) and buy them then.  They&#39;re very excited about <br/>
the upcoming shopping spree and have discussed saving their Christmas <br/>
monies for these &#39;new year treats.&#39; The Game Cube was used and $50, I&#39;m <br/>
sure we&#39;ll see x-boxes that cheap, too :)  I&#39;ve already seen used dz for <br/>
$100, so the price will only drop from there.  The only difference <br/>
between the holidays and regular days (though they&#39;re holy themselves <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) is the competition for my funds by the others on our gifting list.  <br/>
I love showing my kids that their wants and dreams and wishes are <br/>
important and honored ALL year long, not just when the fat guy in red is <br/>
watching; unschooling has afforded me that luxury. <br/>
<br/>

I went and ordered that for Kirby after I read your list.<br/>
<br/>
I have several things for Marty and Holly, and nearly nothing for Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith wanted a small axe for splitting wood, and there was an Estwing  <br/>
camping axe at Home Depot on sale for $30 (from regularly nearly  <br/>
$40.  While I was there I got Kirby three pairs of cotton gloves.   <br/>
Lame, but if I get him one pair of good gloves he&#39;ll lose them, and  <br/>
he only needs them when he leaves for work, not on the way back.   <br/>
These Stanley gloves are the equivalent of tube socks; if he loses  <br/>
one he can use one of the others.  I also ordered him DVDs of the  <br/>
Link and Zelda cartoons from the old Mario Brothers TV show.   That  <br/>
will probably be his favorite thing.  And I got him the Karate Kid on  <br/>
DVD.  Some scatological politically-incorrect dice (copies from a set  <br/>
in a museum in Germany or somewhere).   So with the Stewie movie he  <br/>
won&#39;t have done so badly.  Good.<br/>
