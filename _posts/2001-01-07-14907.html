<div id="ygrps-yiv-715964078">I totally sympathize with your plight because I am also a teacher who<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308037731">we spend quite a bit of time reading  outloud (or being read to my the<br/>
elder child).  At minimum an hour a day.  Usually at bedtime.  Right now,<br/>
the daddy is finishing up the orginal translation of Bambi with the 5 yo,<br/>
the daddy and the 8 yo just finished Gettysburg, the 8 yo has been reading<br/>
Captain Underpants out loud to anyone in earshot and himself and Harry<br/>
Potter #2 and some other book about escaped fairies to himself.  The mom<br/>
(which would be me) has been reading the Illiad out loud at lunch on some<br/>
days, and I&#39;m in charge of picture books.  I also read a lot to the boyz<br/>
when they are in the tub.  Then we also do lots of books on tape.  Just<br/>
brought home one of the Dragon Riders of Pern series tonight and Where the<br/>
REd Fern Grows (#1 son tired of reading it, but was enjoying the story--we<br/>
read the novel a few winters ago and neither parent can muster the<br/>
enthusiasm for re-reading it outloud).  We alos routinely read Discovery<br/>
and Scientific American outloud with the elder son and Ranger Rick with #2<br/>
son.  All OUt loud.  #3 son, 7 months, enjoys Bunny, My HOney and Eric<br/>
Carle books.<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Carol,<br/>
<br/>
Reading daily to my chidlren is not part of *a method* for me.  It&#39;s part of<br/>
being alive, just like sleeping, eating, fixiing the clutch cable when it<br/>
goes out, and a hundred other things I/we do during the day..  It&#39;s being<br/>
done because we like to read.  We like hearing stories and finding out<br/>
information. I love to read and read very fast.  My children are at other<br/>
places along the continumum.<br/>

&gt; ----------<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you guys enjoy reading together?  That&#39;s the test I use whether<br/>
something is for us or not.  If we aren&#39;t enjoying our ourselves then there<br/>
are so many other things we should choose to do.  Our reading aloud time has<br/>
gone in cycles. Some years we do tons of it  and at other times we hardly<br/>
ever sit together.   I carried a cough around for a few months last year<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t let me read more than 3 sentences without having a spasm, so<br/>
right now we are out of the habit of reading together.  I&#39;m hoping Jan<br/>
brings a change to that. We used to read for an hour or more at bedtime, but<br/>
that shifted also as the kids got older.<br/>
<br/>
There is no magic *way* to become educated. The activities and materials<br/>
that work one year won&#39;t work the next, what with growth and maturity<br/>
changes.  Even financial changes have a way of impacting home education, the<br/>
years when we have a bit extra we travel more and go more places, thus<br/>
wilding changing our daiily schedules.<br/>
<br/>
Searching is good.  I think it&#39;s something most of us all during these<br/>
years. Searching for new materials, experiences and new ways to spend out<br/>
time.  Worrying and struggling though, that&#39;s usually counterproductive<br/>
though, as the time and energy spent doing these things takes away from<br/>
searching and actually living together.  I find things that fill our days<br/>
with activities we enjoy and when they begin to wane or become dull and<br/>
repetitive, I strike out on another search..... along with my kids.  The<br/>
older they get the more they know what they want to learn about and how.<br/>
<br/>
Which part are you struggling with?  Right now I&#39;m struggling with wanting<br/>
to actuall listen to everything my children want to tell me.  With kids 7,<br/>
8, and 10 it seems my days are filled with constant chatter and here I am<br/>
craving peace and quiet.  :(<br/>

I read daily after lunch to my older kids...7, 10, 12 and 14.  We&#39;ve done <br/>
this for years at this time...while the littler ones nap.  I also read to my <br/>
younger kids before their naps and before bedtime.  Their sibs also read to <br/>
them, and Dad.  We also go through cycles of reading...their interest waxes <br/>
and wanes.  My 7yo does not have the attention span to listen very long, but <br/>
will listen to books on tape and certain stories.  Remarkably, when he does <br/>
listen, he can usually tell us exactly where we left off in a story.  He <br/>
likes fantasy books...like the  Wizard of Oz series by Frank Baum, and Harry <br/>
Potter, but the rest of the kids prefer historical fiction, nature stories <br/>
and adventure stories.  Right now we&#39;re reading aloud David Copperfield, <br/>
mostly because my 14yo is going through a Dicken&#39;s phase.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>
we&#39;ll finish it though, because the 7 and 10 yo are having a hard time <br/>
listening to it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036239364">The absolute worst thing for my kids is to NOT get bedtime stories.  They<br/>
are 8 & 5.  We always do at least two picture books (when I&#39;m just beat).<br/>
 Dad reads at bedtime sometimes.  Other nights it can go for 45 minutes. <br/>
We read in the daytime too, but not as consistently.  (We&#39;ve only missed<br/>
bedtime stories a few times).<br/>
<br/>
We usually have a chapter book going.  8 yr old reads to us sometimes.  5<br/>
yr old has been known to &quot;read&quot; to us too.  We do include nonfiction<br/>
books.  They listen to books on tape too, especially in the car and at<br/>
breakfast or lunch.  I try to get unabridged versions.  Our library has a<br/>
fair selection.  We&#39;ve enjoyed Charlotte&#39;s Web, read by the author,<br/>
numerous times.  Harry Potter is great on tape too, since it is read in<br/>
English, rather than American!  You will learn how to really pronounce<br/>
Hermione!  My Louisiana Sky is another great book on tape - read with the<br/>
southern accent and a very touching story.  The whole family looks at the<br/>
newspaper (5 yr old likes the weather page).<br/>
<br/>
We will probably finish Charlie and the Chocolate Factory today.  I<br/>
sometimes feel bad that I don&#39;t read more picture books to my youngest. <br/>
She loves to hear the same stories over and over, but I need new stories<br/>
for reading aloud.  However, my mom says that when I was 9 or so I read<br/>
Charlotte&#39;s Web repeatedly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606771174">Dear Carol,<br/>
I find the combination of Charlotte Mason classic book reading and <br/>
unschooling works well for our family.  I usually pick the book and will <br/>
read 1-2 chapters/day.  If my 2 older girls (10, 8) are interested we <br/>
continue with it; if not, we drop it.  We were listening to story tapes in <br/>
the car until the tape player &quot;ate&quot; my Handel&#39;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.  I don&#39;t dare <br/>
feed it any more tapes.  I generally pick books from a reading list and/or <br/>
the children&#39;s interests.<br/>

&gt; &gt;my own than what I learned in college.  It is SO important in this<br/>
&gt; &gt;situation to always remember that TRUE education happens only on a very<br/>
&gt; &gt;individual basis, and public education only happens as a &#39;side effect&#39; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;its real function, which is organization.  You cannot have 30 kids in a<br/>
&gt; &gt;classroom with one adult and not have discipline and organization  be<br/>
&gt; &gt;your number one priority.  When you take responsibility for educating  at<br/>
&gt; &gt;home, all that  stuff goes out the window and your kids can settle down<br/>
&gt; &gt;to do the things that really count , without a beauacracy in the way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;You simply remove the third party.   I feel certain that  this is  the<br/>
&gt; &gt;reason so many kids take off and really make progress once they&#39;re home.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;      It&#39;s a different situation to be in when you&#39;ve been on both sides<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the fence, but I found that once I changed MY definiton of what<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;teaching them&quot; was (like reading and having interactive experiences<br/>
&gt; &gt;rather than paperwork),  I realized that I  HAVE  been teaching  all this<br/>
&gt; &gt;time, along with my husband, family , neighbors, and anyone else my<br/>
&gt; &gt;children come into contact with.   When people ask  if I &#39;teach&#39;  my kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;on a daily basis now, I simply say &#39;yes&#39; and leave it at that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Best of luck, and keep your chin up!!       Amy in NY<br/>
