<br/>
&lt;&lt;  There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; in most<br/>
tribes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of Indian language groups and cultures, some totally unrelated <br/>
to the rest,  and I think this is too great a generalization to make.  <br/>
<br/>
I recieved a long, horribly abusive post from Lynda in private, berating me <br/>
for all manner of things, but I do want to say for the list that it would be <br/>
my preference that we talk about unschooling here, and stick to what we <br/>
personally have seen and know.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfounded statements like &lt;&lt;There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; <br/>
in most tribes. &gt;&gt; don&#39;t serve to educate us, they are misinformation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a private side-attack should be acceptable, but I had been <br/>
warned.  Months ago I was told that Lynda had been asked to leave another <br/>
homeschooling discussion group because she would make unfounded statements <br/>
and attack those who asked for evidence.  This has happened BIGTIME here, and <br/>
I no longer feel safe to post. <br/>
<br/>
According to what I&#39;ve received in private, all on the list agree with Lynda <br/>
that I&#39;m evil.  I seriously doubt that is true.  Another undocumentable <br/>
statement with as much merit as some of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I could keep this secret so as not to disturb the peace, but I so object to <br/>
private attacks of this magnitude that I call on the group for defense.    <br/>
For one example of many I will not make, &quot;Four Corners&quot; refers to a small <br/>
region of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.  It doesn&#39;t extend to the <br/>
entire states by any means.  I don&#39;t remember where Lynda lives, and she <br/>
won&#39;t tell me except for her having gone back through the archives and cited <br/>
message numbers.  All I wanted were simple strai!&quot;) with the private response <br/>
to the same issue below it:<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that they used that phrase but more that it is pharse understood<br/>
today and works as a modern day explanation of how things were.  Children<br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;belong&quot; to individual parents.  Something that we hear so much<br/>
now--&quot;Those are MY children&quot;  &quot;I will raise them the way I want&quot;  etc., etc.<br/>
etc.  More like children are chattel than small people that are a gift put<br/>
into our care to raise with love and consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Children learned from all elders in a tribe.  Children learned from whomever<br/>
was doing whatever it was that they needed/wanted to learn.  The &quot;village&quot;<br/>
raised the child.  There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; in most<br/>
tribes.<br/>
<br/>
Better explanation???<br/>

&quot;Regardless of the school system they are in, Navajo students find<br/>
<br/>
themselves in an environment controlled and dominated by non-Indians. Most<br/>
<br/>
of the teachers and administrators in reservation schools are Anglo [white].<br/>
<br/>
Public school boards of education are dominated by non-Indians and those few<br/>
<br/>
Indians who do serve wield little authority. Parent advisory boards are the<br/>
<br/>
BIA school equivalent of a board of education; while these are all Indian,<br/>
<br/>
their function is only advisory and they are essentially powerless.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Navajos, in fact, have been excluded from the decision-making process in<br/>
<br/>
these school systems. The result has been a variety of education policies<br/>
<br/>
unrelated to the Navajo community. The Navajo language and culture have been<br/>
<br/>
largely ignored in the curriculum offered to Navajo students. (United<br/>
<br/>
States, 1975, pp. 126-127)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Enforcement of the English-only regulations was usually strict. Lawrence<br/>
<br/>
Horn, a Blackfeet, who attended the government school at Heart Butte,<br/>
<br/>
recalled students getting a stroke of a leather strap with holes in it every<br/>
<br/>
time they spoke Indian (Parsons, 1980). &quot;<br/>

<br/>
Further, there was one over all model and it was the Carlisle school and<br/>
<br/>
government regulation.  Again you speak as an authority about something you<br/>
<br/>
know absolutely nothing about!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>

signaled a change in U.S. policy towards Native people. Instead of directly<br/>

killing California indigenous people, reservations were created and<br/>
<br/>
indigenous people were re-located to them. The children were taken, often by<br/>
<br/>
force, away from their parents and to far-away re-education centers.<br/>
<br/>
Children as young as four attended these re-education centers. They were<br/>

<br/>
Children could not have visitors, including their parents, while they stayed<br/>
<br/>
at the centers. Some children stayed for years at a time. Indian children<br/>

were often farmed out as free labor to white settlers in boarding school<br/>

face, beaten for being an Indian, feeling ashamed of the color of my skin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Tears and Bitter Pills, Mariana Kawall Leal Ferreira.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm">http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to many observers, the regimen of the schools usually included<br/>
<br/>
getting Indians to dress, speak, and act like white people (see for example,<br/>
<br/>
Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At that time Indians were not U.S. citizens, and they lacked the right to<br/>
<br/>
control their own lives and the education of their children (Eder & Reyhner,<br/>
<br/>
1988; Whiteman, 1986).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/jan98ward.htm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indian Commissioner Thomas J. Morgan wrote in 1889 that &quot;the Indians must<br/>
<br/>
conform &#39;to the white man&#39;s ways,&#39; peaceably if they will, forcibly if they<br/>
<br/>
must.&quot; Many Indians began their education at this time in boarding schools,<br/>
<br/>
often far from home, where they had their hair cut, where their native<br/>
<br/>
clothes were replaced, and where they were often punished for speaking their<br/>
<br/>
own languages (Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
While some Indian resistance was crushed by dramatic massacres, for the most<br/>
<br/>
part it was subdued by a combination of disease, alcohol, food rationing,<br/>
<br/>
the cooperation of Indian collaborators, and the theft of children for<br/>
<br/>
boarding schools - a situation not radically unlike today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105328701">I think this topic continues to get worse the more posts that are made. Some things don&#39;t dignify a response and are better left unsaid, especially when all those posts are clogging up our message board. I am interested in hearing about unschooling, but I may have to unsubscribe if this pettiness continues.        <br/>

tribes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of Indian language groups and cultures, some totally unrelated <br/>
to the rest,  and I think this is too great a generalization to make.  <br/>
<br/>
I recieved a long, horribly abusive post from Lynda in private, berating me <br/>
for all manner of things, but I do want to say for the list that it would be <br/>
my preference that we talk about unschooling here, and stick to what we <br/>
personally have seen and know.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfounded statements like &lt;&lt;There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; <br/>
in most tribes. &gt;&gt; don&#39;t serve to educate us, they are misinformation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a private side-attack should be acceptable, but I had been <br/>
warned.  Months ago I was told that Lynda had been asked to leave another <br/>
homeschooling discussion group because she would make unfounded statements <br/>
and attack those who asked for evidence.  This has happened BIGTIME here, and <br/>
I no longer feel safe to post. <br/>
<br/>
According to what I&#39;ve received in private, all on the list agree with Lynda <br/>
that I&#39;m evil.  I seriously doubt that is true.  Another undocumentable <br/>
statement with as much merit as some of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I could keep this secret so as not to disturb the peace, but I so object to <br/>
private attacks of this magnitude that I call on the group for defense.    <br/>
For one example of many I will not make, &quot;Four Corners&quot; refers to a small <br/>
region of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.  It doesn&#39;t extend to the <br/>
entire states by any means.  I don&#39;t remember where Lynda lives, and she <br/>
won&#39;t tell me except for her having gone back through the archives and cited <br/>
message numbers.  All I wanted were simple strai!&quot;) with the private response <br/>
to the same issue below it:<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that they used that phrase but more that it is pharse understood<br/>
today and works as a modern day explanation of how things were.  Children<br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;belong&quot; to individual parents.  Something that we hear so much<br/>
now--&quot;Those are MY children&quot;  &quot;I will raise them the way I want&quot;  etc., etc.<br/>
etc.  More like children are chattel than small people that are a gift put<br/>
into our care to raise with love and consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Children learned from all elders in a tribe.  Children learned from whomever<br/>
was doing whatever it was that they needed/wanted to learn.  The &quot;village&quot;<br/>
raised the child.  There were no orphans or even a word for &quot;orphan&quot; in most<br/>
tribes.<br/>
<br/>
Better explanation???<br/>

boarding schools.  Ya know, &quot;barbarians,&quot; and &quot;animals&quot; were two of their<br/>
<br/>
favorite adjectives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the difference of language to-day lies two-thirds of our trouble. . . .<br/>
<br/>
Schools should be established, which children should be required to attend;<br/>
<br/>
their barbarous dialect should be blotted out and the English language<br/>
<br/>
substituted. (Report of the Indian Peace Commissioners, 1868, pp. 16-17)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;how easy it would be to assimilate Indians into the general population by<br/>
<br/>
giving them a white man&#39;s education for a few years in a boarding school<br/>
<br/>
(Hoxie, 1984).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;if there were a sufficient number of reservation boarding-school-buildings<br/>
<br/>
to accommodate all the Indian children of school age, and these building<br/>
<br/>
could be filled and kept filled with Indian pupils, the Indian problem would<br/>
<br/>
be solved within the school age of the Indian child now six years old.<br/>
<br/>
(Oberly, 1885, cxiii)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;English language only must be taught the Indian youth placed there for<br/>
<br/>
educational and industrial training at the expense of the Government. If<br/>
<br/>
Dakota or any other language is taught such children, they will be taken<br/>
<br/>
away. (Atkins, 1887, p. xxi)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every nation is jealous of its own language, and no nation ought to be more<br/>
<br/>
so than ours, which approaches nearer than any other nationality to the<br/>
<br/>
perfect protection of its people. True Americans all feel that the<br/>
<br/>
Constitution, laws, and institutions of the United States, in their<br/>
<br/>
adaptation to the wants and requirements of man, are superior to those of<br/>
<br/>
any other country; and they should understand that by the spread of the<br/>
<br/>
English language will these laws and institutions be more firmly established<br/>
<br/>
a nd widely disseminated. Nothing so surely and perfectly stamps upon an<br/>
<br/>
individual a national characteristic as language. . . . [As the Indians] are<br/>
<br/>
in an English-speaking country, they must be taught the language which they<br/>
<br/>
must use in transacting business with the people of this country. Atkins,<br/>
<br/>
1887, pp. xxi-xxiii)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All instruction shall be in the English language. Pupils shall be required<br/>
<br/>
to converse with employees and each other in English. All school employees<br/>
<br/>
must be able to speak English fluently. (Rules for Indian Schools, 1898, p.<br/>

&quot;Kluckhohn and Leighton reported that 95% of Navajo children &quot;went home<br/>

&quot;In an introductory heading to a 1923 Current History article on &quot;America&#39;s<br/>

&quot;Regardless of the school system they are in, Navajo students find<br/>
<br/>
themselves in an environment controlled and dominated by non-Indians. Most<br/>
<br/>
of the teachers and administrators in reservation schools are Anglo [white].<br/>
<br/>
Public school boards of education are dominated by non-Indians and those few<br/>
<br/>
Indians who do serve wield little authority. Parent advisory boards are the<br/>
<br/>
BIA school equivalent of a board of education; while these are all Indian,<br/>
<br/>
their function is only advisory and they are essentially powerless.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Navajos, in fact, have been excluded from the decision-making process in<br/>
<br/>
these school systems. The result has been a variety of education policies<br/>
<br/>
unrelated to the Navajo community. The Navajo language and culture have been<br/>
<br/>
largely ignored in the curriculum offered to Navajo students. (United<br/>
<br/>
States, 1975, pp. 126-127)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Enforcement of the English-only regulations was usually strict. Lawrence<br/>
<br/>
Horn, a Blackfeet, who attended the government school at Heart Butte,<br/>
<br/>
recalled students getting a stroke of a leather strap with holes in it every<br/>
<br/>
time they spoke Indian (Parsons, 1980). &quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Yes indeedy,  you are AGAIN questioning me or any assertion that I may<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Further, there was one over all model and it was the Carlisle school and<br/>
<br/>
government regulation.  Again you speak as an authority about something you<br/>
<br/>
know absolutely nothing about!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>

Two of our girls ran away...but they got caught. They tied their legs up,<br/>
<br/>
tied their hands behind their backs, put them in the middle of the hallway<br/>
<br/>
so that if they fell, fell asleep or something, the matron would hear them<br/>
<br/>
and she&#39;d get out there and whip them and make them stand up again. (Helma<br/>

&quot;The placement of North American Indian youngsters in residential boarding<br/>
<br/>
schools - and the abusive treatment they received there - is a part of our<br/>
<br/>
history that is seldom talked about.&quot;<br/>

&quot;Its effects, they say, were more devastating than the sexual assaults and<br/>

beatings that occurred in at least some of the 125 Indian Residential<br/>

Schools from the mid-19th century until the 1970s.&quot;<br/>

Documentary. While she weaves her baskets according to traditional<br/>
<br/>
techniques of the Hupa, Yurok and Karuk nations, Vivien Hailstone re-weaves<br/>
<br/>
the historical and cultural background of these Northern California peoples.<br/>
<br/>
She tells of the near disappearance of this art when, as a young girl in a<br/>
<br/>
boarding school, she was forbidden to express her heritage, either through<br/>
<br/>
her language or the practice of a craft passed on by her grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Also, beginning in the 1880s, boarding schools were established, resulting<br/>
<br/>
in the forced separation of children from their families.  Language Loss and<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Boarding Schools or Concentration Camps? The end of the Gold Rush era<br/>
<br/>
signaled a change in U.S. policy towards Native people. Instead of directly<br/>
<br/>
killing California indigenous people, reservations were created and<br/>
<br/>
indigenous people were re-located to them. The children were taken, often by<br/>
<br/>
force, away from their parents and to far-away re-education centers.<br/>
<br/>
Children as young as four attended these re-education centers. They were<br/>
<br/>
forced to cut their hair and give up their clothing upon arrival.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Children could not have visitors, including their parents, while they stayed<br/>
<br/>
at the centers. Some children stayed for years at a time. Indian children<br/>
<br/>
were often farmed out as free labor to white settlers in boarding school<br/>
<br/>
communities, and sometimes sold outright at auctions held by boarding school<br/>
<br/>
teachers.&quot;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm">http://www.originalvoices.org/USGovtRolesSix.htm</a><br/>

&quot;You know how I was raised? In a boarding school, being slapped across the<br/>
<br/>
face, beaten for being an Indian, feeling ashamed of the color of my skin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Tears and Bitter Pills, Mariana Kawall Leal Ferreira.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The model for what became an entire system was the Carlisle Indian School,<br/>
<br/>
established in Pennsylvania in 1875 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, a man<br/>
<br/>
whose main qualification for the task seems to have been that he&#39;d earlier<br/>
<br/>
served as warden of a military prison at Fort Marion, Florida. Following<br/>
<br/>
Pratt&#39;s stated objective of &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in each student, Carlisle<br/>
<br/>
and other such facilities-Chilocco, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Haskell,<br/>
<br/>
Riverside; by 1902, there were two-dozen of thern-systematically<br/>
<br/>
&quot;deculturated&quot; their pupils. Children brought to the schools as young as age<br/>
<br/>
six were denied most or all direct contact with their families and societies<br/>
<br/>
for years on end. They were shorn of their hair and required to dress in the<br/>
<br/>
manner of Euro-America, forbidden to speak their languages or practice their<br/>
<br/>
religions, prevented from learning their own histories or being in any other<br/>
<br/>
way socialized among their own people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Individual native families and, often, whole societies resisted the process.<br/>
<br/>
In 1891, and again in 1893, Congress authorized the use of police, troops<br/>
<br/>
and other forcible means to compel the transfer of children from reservation<br/>
<br/>
to boarding school, and to keep them there once they&#39;d arrived. Hence,<br/>
<br/>
despite the best efforts of their elders, and not infrequently of the<br/>
<br/>
students themselves, a total of 21,568 indigenous children--about a third of<br/>
<br/>
the targeted age group-were confined in the schools in 1900. As of the late<br/>
<br/>
1920s, the system had been diversified and expanded to the point that<br/>
<br/>
upwards of eighty percent of each successive generation of native youth was<br/>
<br/>
being comprehensively &quot;acculturated&quot; in a more-or-less uniform fashion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to many observers, the regimen of the schools usually included<br/>
<br/>
getting Indians to dress, speak, and act like white people (see for example,<br/>
<br/>
Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At that time Indians were not U.S. citizens, and they lacked the right to<br/>
<br/>
control their own lives and the education of their children (Eder & Reyhner,<br/>
<br/>
1988; Whiteman, 1986).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indian Commissioner Thomas J. Morgan wrote in 1889 that &quot;the Indians must<br/>
<br/>
conform &#39;to the white man&#39;s ways,&#39; peaceably if they will, forcibly if they<br/>
<br/>
must.&quot; Many Indians began their education at this time in boarding schools,<br/>
<br/>
often far from home, where they had their hair cut, where their native<br/>
<br/>
clothes were replaced, and where they were often punished for speaking their<br/>
<br/>
own languages (Whiteman, 1986).&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
While some Indian resistance was crushed by dramatic massacres, for the most<br/>
<br/>
part it was subdued by a combination of disease, alcohol, food rationing,<br/>
<br/>
the cooperation of Indian collaborators, and the theft of children for<br/>
<br/>
boarding schools - a situation not radically unlike today.<br/>

But that&#39;s what teachers say about bullies in school.  &quot;Just ignore them and <br/>
they&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br/>

On the other hand perhaps there is no way to stop a bully whatsoever, and <br/>
those afflicted with being picked on have to just endure it like a disease <br/>
and not complain to others around them.  Suffer with dignity and all...  <br/>
<br/>
Is it ever appropriate to ask bullies to stop?<br/>
