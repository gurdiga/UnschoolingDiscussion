<div id="ygrps-yiv-206919848">I&#39;m concerned about my 4 year old son.  He has decided that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to brush his teeth anymore.  This has been going on for <br/>
months and is getting worse and worse.  He is brushing his teeth <br/>
about once a week at this point.  He always used to just brush at the <br/>
same time his brother brushed.  Sometimes his sister and I brushed at <br/>
the same time as them too.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe he doesn&#39;t like brushing at night (too tired).  So I <br/>
started asking him if he wanted to brush his teeth with me in the <br/>
morning.  Nope.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve explained to him about cavities, and about how he can avoid <br/>
getting them by brushing.  I tried to get out of him why he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to brush.  At first he told me that his teeth hurt so he didn&#39;t <br/>
want me to brush them.  He likes our dentist, so I asked if I should <br/>
make an appointment at the dentist to have her check his teeth and <br/>
clean them.  Since he&#39;s not brushing well, I figured 3 or 4 cleanings <br/>
a year instead of two might be good.  He said yes about the dentist, <br/>
I made the appointment, and an hour before the appointment he refused <br/>
to get in the car.  I called and cancelled.  They weren&#39;t happy <br/>
(Can&#39;t you just make him get in the car?)  Ugh.  I think that maybe <br/>
his teeth really didn&#39;t hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
I had our homeopath talk to him about it.  She explained to him how <br/>
candy sometimes gets stuck between his teeth and he has to make sure <br/>
he gets it all out.  She told him about battery operated toothbrushes <br/>
and we went out and bought him one.  He used it two days and that was <br/>
the end of that.  <br/>
<br/>
We have about 6 different kinds of toothpaste.  Sesame street <br/>
toothpaste, Scooby toothpaste, Tweety toothpaste, Mickey toothpaste, <br/>
and more.  <br/>
<br/>
We read a book called, &quot;I know why I brush my teeth&quot;.  He seemed to <br/>
enjoy the story.  It didn&#39;t change his brushing habits though. <br/>
<br/>
Then, his brother and sister each lost a tooth and got money for <br/>
their teeth.  He asked if his teeth rot and fall out because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t brush, then he will get money too.  I said no, the tooth <br/>
fairy doesn&#39;t give money if your teeth fall out because they were <br/>
rotten.  He understands, no tooth fairy money for rotting out teeth. <br/>
I somehow don&#39;t think the money for rotten, falling out teeth is the <br/>
real reason but just an afterthought. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;s holding out for.  Maybe he&#39;s waiting to see if <br/>
he really will get cavities if he doesn&#39;t brush?  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been about 4 days since he&#39;s brushed.  Tonight he rinsed his <br/>
mouth out with the kids&#39; act ani-plaque rinse at least.   <br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I would have held him down to brush his teeth if he <br/>
refused to brush.  I don&#39;t parent like that now, and I really don&#39;t <br/>
want to force him to brush.  But I don&#39;t want to see him with serious <br/>
dental problems either.  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Would this concern you too?  <br/>

All the suggestions I would have you have tried. And yes it would concern<br/>
me. Teeth brushing is something important to me. Fortunately my kids think<br/>
so too. I am very curious as to what others may say about this one. Good<br/>
luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615807194">This is very good Sandra, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that maybe he&#39;d go for using a mouthwash.<br/>
<br/>
personally I think that there are lots of reasons why people get <br/>
cavities.  I brushed ALL THE TIME as a child and had loads of cavities.  <br/>
Mark never brushed and doesn&#39;t have one.  He does have gum disease. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could pick out a new toothbrush and paste and a <br/>
mouthwash/plaque liquid. <br/>
<br/>
I would personally almost be more disturbed by the bad breath.  Janene <br/>
doesn&#39;t always brush her teeth and sometimes her mouth stinks.  I&#39;ll say <br/>
&quot;I want to cuddle with you but your breath stinks, think you could go <br/>
brush your teeth for me?&quot;  She&#39;ll run off gladly.  She&#39;s also told me <br/>
when my breath was stinkie--it goes both ways! <br/>
<br/>
btw we replace brushes every 3-4 months.  Sometimes more often.  I also <br/>
keep brushes locked away in a cabinet, the idea of toilet water <br/>
spritzing my toothbrush is disgusting. <br/>
<br/>
Here is an article I wrote about cavities... at the bottom are some <br/>
links.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBSepOct02p164.html">http://www.lalecheleague.org/NB/NBSepOct02p164.html</a>    <br/>
According to my research there are lots of KNOWN causes... Cause of <br/>
Dental Caries<br/>
1. Streptococcus mutans, a bacteria that can be passed from parent to child.<br/>
2. High risk factors in pregnancy, including maternal stress, illness, <br/>
antibiotic use, and poor diet.<br/>
3. Poor family diet.<br/>
4. Poor oral hygiene.<br/>
5. Dry mouth.<br/>
6. Frequent and prolonged exposure to sugar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030029997">Jayn is going to be four in about 2 weeks, and rarely brushes her teeth.<br/>
Sometimes she says her teeth hurt, and has allowed me to look in her<br/>
mouth at the sore place, but the soreness seems to move at will. I can&#39;t<br/>
see any bad looking rotting or cavities like I have seen in pictures<br/>
procured online. On rare occasions she had bad breath and one of us<br/>
mentions it as being some food caught and she will brush then. She<br/>
really hates pretty much all the toothpastes we have tried, including<br/>
the kid&#39;s flavors. She is more likely to brush with plain water when in<br/>
the tub. We have a bunch of brushes, electric and otherwise which she<br/>
now uses to scrub the tub or her dolls. I let her know when her teeth<br/>
seem to be yellow with food, and she often will then brush. I tell her<br/>
that she is more likely to get cavities and need fillings if she never<br/>
brushes, as that seems reasonable, and shown her images that seem to be<br/>
fascinating to her. I stress that it is especially a good idea if she<br/>
has been eating chocolate. I think we were lucky in that she had no<br/>
teeth at all until 8 days before her first birthday. I also feel good<br/>
that we are still nursing. Sometimes I get concerned that her teeth will<br/>
suffer, but so far, so good. I model brushing, flossing and tongue<br/>
scraping because without assiduous effort I have inherited a tendency to<br/>
bad breath. My dh never suffers from it, and brushes his teeth only<br/>
once/day, and flosses if he feels something stuck. He has a crown, but<br/>
it was from an accident not cavities. I hope Jayn has his strong teeth.<br/>

We saw a program on Discovery Channel or maybe National Geographic Channel <br/>
about bugs and pests and things that are in a home that are unhealthy. One of <br/>
the things they showed was when someone goes to the bathroom and flushes the <br/>
toilet a very fine mist of toilet water raises up. It takes awhile, but <br/>
eventually spreads around the room and settles on all surfaces. So if someone in the <br/>
house is sick and uses the toilet those germs will settle on a toothbrush that <br/>
might be left out on the sink. Moly and Jack looked at me with *Ewww Gross* <br/>
looks on their faces. I got the keys and we went right to the store. We bought <br/>
new toothbrushes and those travel caps, and a new cup for them. We put the caps <br/>
on and put the brushes in the cup and put the cup in the medicine cabinet. We <br/>
uses to leave the cup by the sink. NO MORE! <br/>

I rarely brushed as a child. I never had one cavity. Once my childhood <br/>
dentist told my Mom that I had more perfect teeth than someone who had spent <br/>
thousands on dental care. Until I was sixteen and got my wisdom teeth, my teeth were <br/>
perfectly straight. When they started to come in they pushed my teeth and I <br/>
have one on the bottom row that is crooked now, other than that I had a good <br/>
mouth. Now as an adult I am more conscientious about brushing. I do it twice a <br/>
day, sometimes more, and I have three cavities. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eating carrots and apples helps clean teeth.  <br/>
Rinsing with water, using a toothpick, wiping his teeth with a wet <br/>

He might not like toothpaste. That is why I hated to brush as a child. <br/>
Toothpaste burned my mouth. And I have a poor gag reflex, so on top of a burning <br/>
mouth, I was constantly feeling like I was going to puke. Maybe you could ask him <br/>
if he doesn&#39;t want to brush because of this. Maybe if he just used the brush <br/>
and no toothpaste and a little of some mild mouthwash? Maybe his toothbrush is <br/>
too hard? Have you bought him a soft one? Maybe like Sandra suggested he <br/>
could get a washcloth nice and warm and rub his teeth and gums, that is what I <br/>
used when my kids were very little and just started getting teeth. Jack used to <br/>
swallow the toothpaste and it always made him sick to his stomach. Is your son <br/>
swallowing the toothpaste? So many things could be happening that are putting <br/>
him off. I hope you can find something that helps.<br/>

an issue of him brushing his teeth.<br/>

Maybe give him a wet toothbrush (new one so it doesn&#39;t retain the toothpaste<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103506111">My daughter (nearly 6) doesnt&#39; use toothpaste - just water and a toothbrush. Out of curiousity, I asked her dentist who said that it was pretty common for kids of that age not to like/use toothpaste and really didn&#39;t make much (if any) difference. <br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;ve never forced brushing her teeth (altho we did play toothbrushing games when she was 2 or 3 like naming each tooth, or pretending to be someone else brushing her teeth).  For a couple of years the toothbrushing was pretty hit or miss (although we probably mostly got at least 50% brushing).  Now she remembers brushing and makes sure it happens every night.  She has never had a cavity.  Both her father and I have good teeth, though. <br/>
<br/>
I did force her to sit through a dental cleaning for a first visit to the dentist when she was 4 -- which I view as a HUGE betrayal and something that I would NEVER do again.  Fortunately it does not appear to have turned her off dentists -- though who knows what kind of damage it may have done in terms of not having her body boundaries respected......sigh....... <br/>

As for the importance of tooth brushing, Heather questioned me on this <br/>
the other day. She had her teeth brushed twice a day by me or her father <br/>
until she was 9. We went to the dentist the other day and he reckoned <br/>
she has 9 cavities. I&#39;m leaving the alleged cavities until we get home <br/>
cos treatment is free in England plus I don&#39;t trust any dentist who gets <br/>
more money the more work he does......My two boys have been more lax <br/>
about brushing and they have no cavities. Heather now reckons my theory <br/>
about toothbrushing is a load of plop. Hrad to convince her otherwise <br/>
based on the evidence :-(<br/>
They mainly brush their teeth now cos if they don&#39;t their breath smells. <br/>
Try that one.<br/>

to brush so she didn&#39;t get cavities and then she did get cavities.  I <br/>
never had cavities myself, so I figured it must have been because I <br/>
brushed every day.  My four year old doesn&#39;t brush well and at the <br/>
last dentist visit she told me to keep up the good work, and that she <br/>
could see that we do a good job of brushing.  (I didn&#39;t tell her the <br/>
truth!)  What&#39;s worrying me is that the brushing is getting worse.  <br/>
I&#39;m kind of feeling like we pushed it before, and that if we push it <br/>
even more he&#39;ll really end up with a cavity this time.  If I look at <br/>
it like that, though, his sister brushed and still got cavities and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  So if he doesn&#39;t brush and does get <br/>
a few cavities, it&#39;s not the end of the world either.  <br/>

You just put about a teaspoon of baking soda and maybe half a teaspoon of <br/>

the toothbrush, set it on that stuff, and use it like toothpaste, refilling it <br/>

That doesn&#39;t burn or gag you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worked at Colgate-Palmolive here in NYC and it is not a secret at <br/>
that company that fluoride toothpaste is, well, not necessary for <br/>
proper oral hygiene; that, if you do not have a healthy diet and <br/>
overall good health, your teeth will not follow suit. My job was to <br/>
create the product and policy reference manual for the US company but <br/>
that ended up being used worldwide at all their consumer affairs <br/>
departments. Let&#39;s say that I had to wrangle with a lot of ethical <br/>
dilemmas in putting what in truth ended up being an encyclopedia of <br/>
everything Colgate-Palmolive. Their legal and marketing department <br/>
always wanted the information to look like they had no fault or were <br/>
not manipulating information to their advantage.<br/>
<br/>
If you read the instructions on the box, it says to use a pea-sized dot <br/>
of toothpaste for brushing. In the commercials, they use at least 3 <br/>
times the amount of toothpaste necessary. So people follow suit and <br/>
they make more money because a tube runs out 3 times as fast. With <br/>
kids, it&#39;s a similar story. Mints and cinnamon makes kids mouth like <br/>
it&#39;s burning. So they use bubble gum flavors and the like. Problem is <br/>
that many kids use too much TP and end up with mottled teeth --caused <br/>
by the over-consumption of fluoride. They know that it is difficult to <br/>
stop kids from eating anything that tastes like candy but if it means <br/>
that it insures profits, hey! why not?<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that many water-supplies in this country have fluoride <br/>
naturally or added by public health law. Technically we really do not <br/>
need fluoride TP in this country --and they know it. But it ensures <br/>
profits because people&#39;s ignorance makes them believe that a <br/>
cosmeceutical like fluoride TP is better than just having a balanced <br/>
diet, drinking lots of water and brushing every day.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one example. Don&#39;t even get me started with tartar control <br/>
TP or, even worse, those EVIL whitening TPs.<br/>
<br/>
While working there I stumbled upon research suggesting that in Asia, <br/>
especially China, given the overall consumption of GREEN TEA (which is <br/>
very high in fluoride) tooth decay is not as rampant as in other <br/>
countries. This report took me to a meeting where R&D, marketing and <br/>
legal people laughed at someone&#39;s quip that &quot;Well, let&#39;s see about <br/>
that&quot;. They just can&#39;t wait for the day McDonald&#39;s and Coca-Cola are so <br/>
huge in China that they&#39;ll just come in blasting from the sky to &quot;save&quot; <br/>
all those Chinese pearly whites.<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t putting a wet toothbrush away in a travel cap allow for more <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-578318976">&lt;&lt;You just put about a teaspoon of baking soda and maybe half a teaspoon<br/>
of <br/>
salt, mix it up a little (in a measuring cup or a little lid or<br/>
whatever), wet <br/>
the toothbrush, set it on that stuff, and use it like toothpaste,<br/>
refilling it <br/>
when it&#39;s getting old.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For years in Australia, I just used baking soda - a period in my life<br/>
completely free of cavities. I wonder why I stopped? I always understood<br/>
that it works both mechanically as a gentle abrasive, and chemically to<br/>
neutralize the acid from sugars on the teeth.<br/>
<br/>
What is the purpose of the salt in the mixture?<br/>

involved.<br/>

<br/>
No I have an idea, but I could  be wrong.<br/>
Quicker abrasion, and it makes the mixture with water less gaggy (for me) <br/>
than straight baking soda.  The two together, when wet, seem to liquify better?<br/>
