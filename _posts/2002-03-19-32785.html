Hi Denise,<br/>
<br/>
Some people are interested in the terms and definitions and so the discussion <br/>
is useful to them. I personally find it very fascinating. To each her own it <br/>
seems.  If you are finding a particular thread irritating you, there could be <br/>
two ways to handle it. The first option would be to simply delete anything to <br/>
do with that thread. For myself, I find when something is irritating me, it <br/>
is an opportunity to learn more about myself because the situation is a <br/>
mirror for me. I have attracted something in my life as a learning <br/>
opportunity. Also, if there is something specific about unschooling you wish <br/>
to talk about, please feel free to bring it up for discussion. And welcome to <br/>
the list.<br/>
