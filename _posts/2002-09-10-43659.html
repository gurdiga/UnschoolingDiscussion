&gt; <br/>

between where he does manage to do something else, but you don&#39;t hear about <br/>
those times since it works?<br/>

times when he does come to me and say &quot;she&#39;s bothering me&quot; and times when he <br/>
does just &quot;quit&quot; and go in his room. So I guess I need to start keeping <br/>
track of how often each happens. Like I did think of, it seems to be at <br/>
least a week since a hitting incident happened. I guess I was looking for an <br/>
answer thinking what we did wasn&#39;t working and maybe it is afterall. Thanks.<br/>
