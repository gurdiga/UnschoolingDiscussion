<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378324641">Can anyone suggest a school that I can register with so that I can <br/>
avoid the evaluation and portfolio requirements in florida? I looked <br/>
up the Florida homeschooling law but I&#39;m confused about what my <br/>
options are. 600, unmbrella, private, are they all the same thing?  <br/>
I&#39;ve found a couple of umbrella schools but they have their own <br/>
attendance and testing requirements.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to <br/>
avoid.  I don&#39;t want anyone poking and prodding my sons and telling <br/>
me what they should know. Aside from the fact that I&#39;m horrible at <br/>
keeping records. Are there any private schools that anyone can <br/>
recommend that is &#39;unschooler friendly&#39;.  From my understanding it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be in the same state. Am I right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297212701">Yes - without even a registration fee! Better yet, it belongs to <br/>
someone on this list.  Nance Confer set up Florida Unschoolers a couple of years <br/>
ago and now has almost 100 kids - you can read more about the options under <br/>
Florida laws at www.parentdirectededucation.org and/or just email Nance privately <br/>
