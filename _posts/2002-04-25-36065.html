&lt;&lt; &gt;Another question for all of you, does anyone have any pro-unschooling <br/>
book <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;or website recommendations that my ds 10 could read and might actually <br/>
 &gt;&gt;want to?&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 12 y.o. loves chatting with the other kids at unschooling.com message <br/>
board. He&#39;s made some nice online friends there...and even traded Pokemon <br/>
cards in the mail with Karin&#39;s son!  <br/>

pokemon card collection! He&#39;s so proud that he has ALL the cards now. :o)<br/>
<br/>
My son is at unschooling.com every single day and I love the fact that he<br/>
has a real reason to write (type) now. He always asks me how to spell words<br/>
(he DOES learn the old ones, I noticed and just asks for words he hasn&#39;t<br/>
spelled yet) and I know he feels connected to the other kids there and knows<br/>
that they unschool like he does. It&#39;s been great for him, and especially for<br/>
me!<br/>

If you are Christian, I can say that Christian Unschooling by Teri Brown has&gt; <br/>

&gt; really liked it.  It&#39;s very short and to the point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was so disappointed with this book.  Seemed to me that they redefined <br/>
unschooling to mean you could unschool part-time or after you make the kids <br/>
do math everyday.  I have loaned it to people to help them move away from a <br/>
school-at-home approach and there were some good points about unschooling not <br/>
being unchristian but overall most of the examples didn&#39;t sound like <br/>
uschooling to me. jmo<br/>

Eclectic Homeschooling, or something like that. In a related matter, I was <br/>
talking to a woman, in line at the grocery store, and she mentioned she <br/>
homeschooled. When I said we followed the unschooling approach, she smiled <br/>
and said, &quot;We unschool too!&quot; I was about to say how happy I was to meet <br/>
another unschooler in Topeka, when she said, &quot;But only in the summer, and on <br/>
vacations, it really gives the kids and me a break, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; I just <br/>
smiled tightly and said that we unschool always, to which she replied that <br/>
she didn&#39;t think she could let her kids do nothing all the time and how did I <br/>
explain unschooling to the Board of Education? I was so shocked that one, she <br/>
thought unschooling equated doing nothing and two, that she was so ignorant <br/>
of Kansas law. I tried to explain it to her, but soon discovered that she was <br/>
so closed minded that she didn&#39;t even want to hear it. :o( (It looked like <br/>
her two girls wanted to hear about it though.)<br/>

of it I did like, just not the redefining of the term &#39;unschooling&#39;.  <br/>

still ask me &#39;how do you know if they are learning&#39;, &#39;what about college&#39;, <br/>
&#39;what about testing&#39; and a really crazy one the other day from a new hser was <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree that the essays accepted for the book do include more folks<br/>
who &quot;unschool except for...&quot; than I was comfortable with.  However, the<br/>
first half of the book is fairly solid unschooling info, and sells the idea<br/>
well, in my opinion.  The author does also discuss, in her introduction to<br/>
the essay section, the problems of different people&#39;s &quot;purity&quot; of<br/>
unschooling, as she puts it (p. 51-2, if you&#39;re looking for it).  She<br/>
comments that she was somewhat lenient on that point, and I think perhaps<br/>
that was a mistake, since it&#39;s contradictory to unschooling as she defined<br/>
it in the first chapters.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ll still stand by my original recommnedation.  As a quick read, I<br/>
think this book has some good points, and the author is convincing about<br/>
unschooling, which was the original question.  (Convincing the doubting<br/>
spouse).<br/>

unschooling.info and if anybody who has read any of them will go  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272707991">Thank you for posting this Pam!  It just occured to me the other day that it <br/>
would be really useful to have some books laying around for my dh to notice <br/>
and perhaps peruse.  I have been seeing lots of discussions about Rue&#39;s book <br/>
but I couldn&#39;t remember which group it was on and finding time to search for <br/>
it was limited.  So, your post was perfect timing.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think any of the books you listed might be something I could find at <br/>
the library?  Is there any place they might be available for sale used?  I <br/>
was thinking that it would be useful to have numerous books but we have a <br/>
very limited budget.<br/>

and Half.com. Half.com tends to tack on lower shipping and handling.  <br/>
Both have ratings for the sellers so you can check their reputations  <br/>
before you buy.<br/>
