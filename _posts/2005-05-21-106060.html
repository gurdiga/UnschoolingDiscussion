<div id="ygrps-yiv-372207357">Hello all.  I have been lurking on this site for about three weeks <br/>
now, and am so grateful that I discovered you all.  I feel like a <br/>
sponge that is soaking up all of these wonderful ideas about life <br/>
and learning.  Right now, I&#39;m looking for opinions on how to <br/>
approach the concept of personal hygiene (or extreme lack thereof) <br/>
from an RU perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I am a single mother homeschooling my ds age 12.  We are still new <br/>
to homeschooling and even newer to the concept of unschooling, so we <br/>
are still very much in a deschooling adjustment period.  My ds <br/>
tolerated attending a small private school through 5th grade, but <br/>
due to a job layoff and new job with about 60% less income, and <br/>
therefore no money for tuition, he transferred into a large <br/>
extremely overcrowded public middle school for 6th grade.  I wish I <br/>
had heard of the concept of unschooling before I enrolled him in ps, <br/>
or I never would have done that hideous thing to him at all.  But <br/>
until last November, homeschooling in my mind had always been <br/>
equivalent to school-at-home and therefore a last resort.  <br/>
<br/>
Not surprisingly, he did not take the transition into ps well at <br/>
all. The anxiety created severe IBS problems, causing him to miss <br/>
quite a bit of school and eventually spiraling him into a suicidal <br/>
depression.  The psychiatrist gave him drugs, and when those didn&#39;t <br/>
work they gave him more drugs, all in an effort to make him able to <br/>
tolerate the *necessary* school atmosphere.  The school was ready to <br/>
hold him back a year because he had missed too many days, therefore <br/>
labeling him as a failure.  It became extremely apparent to me that <br/>
all of them were less concerned about him as a human being, and more <br/>
concerned about him helping to maintain their high test score <br/>
averages in the school district, so I said *enough* and pulled him <br/>
out of school.  He was almost immediately a totally different child, <br/>
as if I had rescued him from death (which I guess I did).  We <br/>
eventually also dumped the psychiatrist (and his drugs).  And we <br/>
dumped the counselor who said that homeschooling was the worst thing <br/>
I could do for my child and who scolded me for never having assigned <br/>
him chores yet in his life, because they were long overdue.  Even <br/>
the IBS problems have completely ceased.  He is no longer depressed <br/>
or suicidal.<br/>
<br/>
Because I was initially afraid of the school questioning me and <br/>
claiming that I was simply trying to avoid truancy, we did attempt <br/>
to do school-at-home for the first two months, but it didn&#39;t work <br/>
well at all.  Not even when we only studied one subject a day and <br/>
only for 30 minutes.  Even if he got to pick the subject.  It became <br/>
obvious that he desperately needed a long period of deschooling with <br/>
a goal of unschooling.  So that&#39;s where we are now.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I work from home, so we just each go about our day <br/>
doing what we each need/want to do, doing activities together as <br/>
much as possible.  Because some days are rather lean on the together <br/>
time, we declared Sunday to be family day (at his request) so that <br/>
we can have one day a week that is just for us to do activities <br/>
together (no work for me and no friends over for him, except on rare <br/>
and mutually agreeable occasions).  He is very much a night owl and <br/>
will often stay up all night and sleep most of the day.  He spends <br/>
his waking hours watching TV and playing video games, or playing <br/>
with his ps friends after they get home in the afternoon.  On <br/>
extremely rare occasions he will read for a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
The only area I worry about in the long term is his extreme lack of <br/>
personal hygiene.  He absolutely hates bathing, washing his hair, <br/>
and brushing his teeth.  He will wear the same clothes for weeks at <br/>
a time, he has taken one shower in the last four months (on Mother&#39;s <br/>
Day as a gift to me, even though I didn&#39;t ask for it), and I cannot <br/>
remember the last time that he brushed his teeth.  Since coercion <br/>
and even blatant bribery with money has failed over the years, I am <br/>
trying to give him space to choose these things on his own, but he <br/>
simply doesn&#39;t.  He did bathe on occasion when in private school <br/>
because the teachers or principal would tell him he needed to.  And <br/>
there was a short time in 5th grade when he chose to shower every <br/>
day, but I&#39;m pretty sure there was peer pressure involved in that.  <br/>
Now he just doesn&#39;t.  Sometimes I break down and do discuss it with <br/>
him, and the reasoning I give to him is his health.  There is truth <br/>
in it being a health issue, but to be totally honest my biggest <br/>
reason for wanting him to be clean has nothing to do with that -- it <br/>
is because I am embarrassed when other adults see him looking dirty <br/>
and unkempt.  I am afraid they will think that he is neglected and <br/>
think poorly of me as his parent (or worse yet, report me to Child <br/>
Protective Services over it).<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m looking for opinions on where this issue fits into RU.  <br/>
Obviously, I haven&#39;t arrived at being a radical unschooler yet, but <br/>
that is the goal.  Is the fact that there is a health issue involved <br/>
make this an area where he doesn&#39;t just get to choose what he wants <br/>
to do (sort of like I would never let him choose to play in the <br/>
middle of a busy highway), or should I continue to let him make his <br/>
own decisions in this area and I just need to be more patient and <br/>
work on healing my own attitude and fears?  I really don&#39;t care so <br/>
much about his wearing the same clothes for two weeks (less <br/>
laundry), but I do worry about the months of not bathing at all or <br/>
brushing his teeth.  Sorry this was so long, but I thought some <br/>
background might be useful.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
 <br/>
Why can&#39;t a weekday be the family day?  If he already has to wait for  <br/>
schoolkids, why black out one of the days they&#39;re all home?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The only area I worry about in the long term is his extreme lack of  <br/>
personal hygiene.  He absolutely hates bathing, washing his hair,  <br/>
and brushing his teeth. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
So if he were going to school he would do it because it was time to go  <br/>
somewhere?<br/>
You could take him somewhere every day, after he&#39;s cleaned up and ready to  <br/>
go, maybe.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- He will wear the same clothes for weeks at <br/>
a time, =-<br/>
 <br/>
Not if you put them in the washing machine when he takes them off.<br/>
If he&#39;s sleeping in them, tell him it&#39;s not good for the sheets and the  <br/>
sheets are yours, so to change for bed.  Then wash what he pulls off.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I cannot <br/>
remember the last time that he brushed his teeth.   Since coercion <br/>
and even blatant bribery with money has failed over the  years, . . .-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If this has been going on for years, then it&#39;s not about deschooling or  <br/>
homeschooling, right?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He did bathe on occasion when in private school <br/>
because the teachers  or principal would tell him he needed to.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If he would do it for them, why wouldn&#39;t he do it for you?<br/>
Why could YOU say &quot;Take a shower now&quot; but in a nice way?<br/>
 <br/>
-=--=- Sometimes I break down and do discuss it with <br/>
him,-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Break down&quot; from WHAT!?<br/>
You have a policy of not discussing things with him?<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Sometimes I break down and do discuss it with <br/>
him, and the  reasoning I give to him is his health.  There is truth <br/>
in it being a  health issue, but to be totally honest my biggest <br/>
reason for wanting him to  be clean has nothing to do with that -- it <br/>
is because I am embarrassed when  other adults see him looking dirty <br/>
and unkempt.  I am afraid they will  think that he is neglected and <br/>
think poorly of me as his parent (or worse  yet, report me to Child <br/>
Protective Services over it).-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If you were regularly discussing things with him, you couldn&#39;t write  <br/>
&quot;sometimes I break down and discuss it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
If you were totally honest with him, you could write to us and say &quot;the  <br/>
reasoning I give him is his health... but to be totally honest...&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He should have heard long ago that it&#39;s embarrassing to you and that you  <br/>
could be in trouble with CPS.  Those things are real and true, and if you  <br/>
haven&#39;t been communicating well with him that could be your first goal, I  think.<br/>

That article might help.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-So I&#39;m looking for opinions on where this issue fits into  RU. =-<br/>
 <br/>
Can we just say unschooling, maybe?  <br/>
Those issues do NOT &quot;fit into&quot; unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I think your question is how to apply principles to this situation.   What <br/>
are your priorities for your relationship with him and for how the  environment <br/>
in which he&#39;s living and learning should be?<br/>
 <br/>
Something went wrong a long time back that has nothing to do with private  <br/>
school or public school.<br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, lots of kids will start showering more (or lots!) when  <br/>
they&#39;re into puberty, and 12 can be the last holdout period for boys.  The  <br/>
gamer boys will tell the younger boys &quot;take a shower,&quot; but I know of NO older  <br/>
gamer boys who don&#39;t take regular showers.  And those are the geekiest of  the <br/>
geek-boys, generally.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-  I really don&#39;t care so much about his wearing the same clothes  for two <br/>
weeks (less <br/>
laundry),-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well it&#39;s not good for the cloth itself, and it&#39;s not as good for his  health <br/>
as changing clothes would be.   Maybe you should take a detour  from <br/>
deschooling for a unit study on germs.  If you as a mom aren&#39;t more  worried about the <br/>
cleanliness in which your child resides, and if your honest  discussion only <br/>
vaguely concerns health, maybe you need to do a google-session  looking up <br/>
bacteria and how laundry detergents and soaps work and maybe your son  would be <br/>
interested in seeing it too.  It might inspire him to want more  showers.  <br/>
 <br/>
What about renting Osmosis Jones?  If he doesn&#39;t want to watch it with  you, <br/>
you could watch it.<br/>
 <br/>
Do you change your own clothes a lot?  Shower lots?  Do you say  &quot;OH, that <br/>
feels good!&quot; when you&#39;re hair&#39;s just clean after you&#39;ve worked in the  yard (or <br/>
whatever) and then taken a shower?<br/>
Would he like new clothes (or  different, used clothes)?<br/>
 <br/>
Is he still depressed?<br/>

<br/>
I think you need to break down and be honestly honest with him.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it seriously *could* be considered an issue that would <br/>
involve CPS. It could jeapordize your unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If he considers school a better option, by all means, he can continue <br/>
to live in filth. If he likes his life right now, he might want to <br/>
consider doing something as simple as showering to remain at home in <br/>
peace and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Not a hard decision, really.<br/>
<br/>
Be honest and quit beating around the bush. He stinks and is filthy, <br/>
and &quot;neglect&quot; IS grounds for a CPS report.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem much like an unschooling issue. But...<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is making sure he knows the facts so that he can <br/>
make wise decisions. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve talked enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904305805">You&#39;ve been through hell and gotten out of it!! Wow!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry at ALL about the personal hygiene thing - after what <br/>
he&#39;s been through, it isn&#39;t that big a deal and, trust me, it is VERY <br/>
very very common among boys his age.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have sons, but I have 3 daughters 14, 17, and 20 and have spent <br/>
a lot of time around a lot of young boys. There seems to be a stage <br/>
that many many many of them go through during which they don&#39;t seem to <br/>
mind at ALL being really stinky and having dirty hair and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Usually this is just before puberty - and sometimes they can really get <br/>
pretty awful smelling. I&#39;ve had some boys in my car, over the years, <br/>
where I had to open the windows and air the car out after they&#39;d been <br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
So - it passes. I BET there will be a time in the not-too-distant <br/>
future when he&#39;ll be taking frequent and really LONG showers and you&#39;ll <br/>
be wondering what the heck he is doing in there &lt;BEG&gt;!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bribe him to shower, if it was me, because I wouldn&#39;t want to have <br/>
him around me, all stinky and gross. MY problem, not his, right? But I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry that he&#39;d never come round to wanting to be clean - for <br/>
himself --- that&#39;ll happen.<br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, I was thinking about that too, until she said it was going on from  <br/>
long ago.<br/>
 <br/>
Glenda, I&#39;d like to know how much physical closeness you have with your  son? <br/>
 My youngest is 11 and we still snuggle up on the couch together a  lot.  He <br/>
only stopped sleeping with me last year.  He has problems  remembering to <br/>
shower and brush his teeth, but I remind him like I always have  (he didn&#39;t <br/>
remember to shower or brush his teeth when he was 3, either).   So, when we&#39;re close <br/>
together, sitting on the couch, and he&#39;s stinky, I don&#39;t  have a bit of a <br/>
problem with telling him I&#39;d enjoy our snuggle more if he were  clean.  <br/>
 <br/>
This is an area where my son needs help remembering how and when to do the  <br/>
proper thing, and like anything (eating, baseball practice), I help him <br/>
remember  to get it done.  I&#39;ve even insisted on the shower at certain times.   The <br/>
lucky thing is he&#39;s 11 now, and I can tell him how much time he has left  from <br/>
the time we have to leave or whatever, or I can point out that he didn&#39;t  <br/>
shower yesterday because we stayed home all day in our pajamas, and he&#39;ll go and  <br/>
shower without being cajoled into it.  It took a long time to get him to  that <br/>
point.  11 years.  :)  He simply wasn&#39;t ready to do it on  his own before <br/>
now.  He&#39;s still not showering independently of his own  choice, but like my <br/>
older sons, I know that day is coming when he will be  using up the hot water <br/>
before I can.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m an unschooler, by the way.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t  interact <br/>
or guide or encourage your children.  Unschooling is all about the  <br/>
*relationship* between the child and his world.  He doesn&#39;t live in a  bubble of his own <br/>
choosing.  Parents are a major part of that world.<br/>
 <br/>
Another thing...Is your shower clean?  Are any of the tiles missing or  does <br/>
the water back up into the tub?  Is it scary in there for him?   Does he have <br/>
enough privacy?  No windows with sheer curtains or  anything like that?  <br/>
There&#39;s a lock on the door?  Does he know HOW to  shower and wash himself?  Is <br/>
there plenty of soap, a washcloth and clean  towels?  Does he object to you seeing <br/>
him naked?  (Will doesn&#39;t want  me to see him anymore.)  Could you sit in the <br/>
bathroom with him while  showers?  Make conversation, talk about the weather. <br/>
 Could you put a  radio in there so he could blast his favorite music while <br/>
he showers?  <br/>
 <br/>
I like a clean shower.  If I&#39;m camping out and the nearest shower is  creepy <br/>
or not clean, I&#39;ll gladly skip showers until I can&#39;t stand myself  anymore.  <br/>
(Lots of people don&#39;t shower when they camp, I know.  I like  to shower on <br/>
occasion if I can.)  Maybe your son doesn&#39;t enjoy the  experience of showering.  <br/>
Maybe he needs help making the environment more  comfy for him.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d definitely ask him how you can help him be get clean more often, and  <br/>
then follow through on it right away.<br/>

 <br/>
I use this with my 12 year old son.  He is a big hugger and I always  tell <br/>
him how good his hair smells when he comes to hug me good night after a  shower. <br/>
 I also remind him about his teeth occasionally....he doesn&#39;t  mind.  He&#39;s <br/>
busy and get preoccupied for hours and often doesn&#39;t shower  because it&#39;s just <br/>
not something that he wants to take time to do.<br/>
 <br/>
His sister has no problem at all telling him that he stiinks!  She  doesn&#39;t <br/>
have much tact and will say something like...&quot;Logan you smell really  really <br/>
bad!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
One thing that saves us in the summer is our pool.  Last summer I had  three <br/>
boys (two stepchildren) here ages 11, 13 and 15.  The 13 year  old showered <br/>
only twice in one month.  I just encouraged them to swim  often and kept <br/>
chlorine in the pool.  They have a room in the garage in the  summer and I just <br/>
didn&#39;t go in there.  The 15 year old was starting to  shower more and with 3 <br/>
teenage girls in the neighborhood I predict he may  be showering more this summer.  <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We do a lot of snuggling in our house and I have a pretty sensitive nose.  I<br/>
have only daughters (8 and 10) but they don&#39;t like to shower either.  I have<br/>
no problem telling them when they smell badly and need to bathe.  I am not<br/>
trying to insult them but just inform them that if they want people to enjoy<br/>
being around them, that it would benefit them to bathe.  Also, it&#39;s harder<br/>
to notice your own body odor or even that of your own kids, so I think that<br/>
by the time I notice that they stink that any other people who have come in<br/>
close contact have already noticed.   My kids can go a good week without<br/>
smelling too badly and longer in the summer when they swim often.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s too much to ask to ask them to shower occasionally for the<br/>
benefit of others who live in the same house or come in close contact with<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids still like to have me shampoo their hair and adjust the water<br/>
temperature in the shower.  I don&#39;t mind helping to make their shower<br/>
experiences as easy as possible.   It just encourages them to do it more<br/>
often.<br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
This made me think that dysfunctional, dictatorial families in which having a dissenting opinion is &quot;talking back&quot; are very likely to create the (very common now) next generation of dysfunctional families in which the adults &quot;don&#39;t know how to communicate&quot; with each other (due to lack of opportunities to practice).<br/>
<br/>
People get all anxious about windows of opportunity to learn foreign language or math and sail right past the critical opportunity to learn to play nice and share.    ::::: overly dramatic sigh :::::<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495709942">This discussion is extremely timely for me.  I have been having issues lately with Richard&#39;s hygiene.  He is 9, and has in the last year started having lots of body odor, mostly after exercising.  He doesn&#39;t like to get in the shower, but once he is in he doesn&#39;t like to get out &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I blew up at him.  There was a lot leading up to it, but some of the things were:  I had asked him to shower every day for the last 5 and he didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t harp on it, just reminded him, and he just forgot each day.  He likes me to set out clothes for him sometimes, and each time I did lately I noticed that he put on everything that I set out *except* the clean underwear.  He has been forgetting to put on deodorant, even with reminders.  He hasn&#39;t brushed his teeth in a week, not a huge problem except that he likes to drink red Fanta so his teeth are red. <br/>
And, the biggest factor leading up to it, I was tired and grumpy!  <br/>
<br/>
So, I blew up about him not taking care of himself.  I felt really bad afterwards, and I apologized and asked him for suggestions to help him remember to do these things.  He gets mad at me if I remind him *too* much, too much like nagging ya know?  So I try really hard not to do that, but he *does* need to be reminded.  So he came up with a list on the bathroom mirror.  That way I only remind him to do his &quot;morning stuff&quot; (kind of a funny name, since mornings at our house are really closer to noon!) and he goes and looks at the list.   It has been working so far, and he seems to like checking each thing off each day.  I work 3 days a week, and on those days he gets himself up and rides his bike to a childcare home.  Those are the days that it has really helped.  I really worry about him smelling since someone called CPS on us a while back (not for that, for homeschooling and a cluttered house, case is to be closed this week, finally!), a smelly kid looks like neglect to a social worker.  He also tends to have a little bit of dandruff, and the anti-dandruff shampoos only work if you shower! &lt;g&gt; So we talked about this, how it looks bad to others if we smell, or have visible dandruff, and that wearing the same underwear for days on end is not the same as wearing the same jeans a couple of days in a row.  <br/>
<br/>
I found out that there was a reason that he wasn&#39;t changing his underwear.  A while back he told me that he didn&#39;t like the feel of his underwear (those boxer briefs, fitted like briefs but with legs like shorts) under his cup/supporter that he has to wear for TaeKwonDo.  He decided that he liked wearing regular boxers, the soft ones made of t-shirt knit, better.  So I bought him a bunch of those.  At some point he changed his mind, but was afraid to tell me.  So he had lots of boxers clean, but no boxer briefs, so he just kept wearing the same ones for a week!  He wasn&#39;t afraid that I would be mad, but he said he was afraid of disappointing me, that I had just spent money on these boxers and then he didn&#39;t like them.  I felt really bad and told him that I wanted him to be comfortable, I don&#39;t care about buying the new underwear.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, things are  much better now, after talking about it with him.  I did talk to him about hygiene before, but not really *why* it is important.  And I am rambling now!<br/>

I don&#39;t think a person would need to be a social worker to feel a smelly  kid <br/>
was a neglected kid.  You could tell him that, in all honesty.   You could <br/>
say that if he grows up and in his own home decides to be dirty, that  only <br/>
makes him look odd and anti-social and might keep him from keeping a job or  <br/>
friends, but that when he&#39;s a kid it makes his mom look bad, odd, anti-social  and <br/>
negletful and that&#39;s not a cool thing to do.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710564597">The biggest hygiene issue here is ds&#39;s finger nails.  He really does not<br/>
like to trim them and when they get too long they gather dirt and become<br/>
very gross looking.  We talked about bacteria and how finger nails harbor it<br/>
and then pass it along to everything we do with our hands including eating.<br/>
That helped but he still likes them long (to scratch of course).  <br/>
<br/>
Last weekend we were all invited to a wedding and I found a big salon style<br/>
manicure kit on sale at Ross.  So I got it and set up bowls of warm soapy<br/>
water and fluffy towels in the living room.  I was thinking of the girls<br/>
when I did this but wouldn&#39;t you know ds joined us and let me wash, cut file<br/>
and buff his nails while we laughed and watched TV. He enjoyed a little<br/>
pampering and it made doing his nails not so much a chore for him.  Who<br/>
would&#39;ve guessed.<br/>

     Where do you draw the line between induviduality and being presentable<br/>

<br/>
My kids love going barefoot, especially my daughter. So I only insist on<br/>
shoes in stores (where you have to), going to friends that don&#39;t know them<br/>
well enough to be understanding about the barefoot thing, classes such as<br/>
drama and art but I hear that they take their shoes off when they get there<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 To a whole lot of people this elicits  many reactions. Some kids (I&#39;ll bet<br/>
the ones who are never allowed to take shoes off) are very angry and shout<br/>
things like &quot;where&#39;s your shoes?&quot; in a very mean tone. Adults laugh and just<br/>
don&#39;t quite know what to do. A lot of people ask them about hurting their<br/>
feet. They have extremely tough feet and rarely ever get cut.<br/>
<br/>
I have felt  worried at times about  what if cps see my children walking<br/>
down the sidewalk barefoot. But it is not worth it to me to get them to stop<br/>
just because for so many other people they have &quot;issues&quot; with this.<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids that if  grown-ups or kids are mean to them about their<br/>
preference to be barefoot they should ask that person why they are so<br/>
interested in their feet.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing, my son is loving being able to grow his hair out long. He is<br/>
11 and his hair is now at his shoulders he wants to grow it long down his<br/>
back. I really want him to keep it out of his eyes, but he likes it that<br/>
way. I think he may be trying to hide behind his bangs, but he just says he<br/>
likes it. I know that a lot of people look at him and can&#39;t understand his<br/>
hair and are afraid to get to know him because of it. I have discussed my<br/>
feelings to him, but he says he doesn&#39;t care what other people think he<br/>
likes his hair long. I think it feels freeing to him.<br/>
I feel in this case to live up to my principles of allowing him freedom of<br/>
choices for his own body I must let him wear his hair how he likes it and he<br/>
will have to live the consequences of his choice even how much I wish I<br/>
could spare him that.<br/>

Anyone have any thoughts on this?<br/>

Depends who the others are, how the kid feels about being possibly disliked  <br/>
or shunned, whether it&#39;s actually a danger to some social situation (will an  <br/>
ex-husband throw a fit or take legal action, or is it just kinda tacky?);  <br/>

As opposed to what?  Cutting it off while he&#39;s sleeping?  Force  him to go to <br/>
a barber?<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
No he won&#39;t.  The decision making repeats over and over and  over.  It&#39;s not <br/>
like getting a tattoo.  He could cut his hair off in  the next half hour, in <br/>
the next minute, and then not cut it again for five  years.  <br/>
 <br/>
When the consequences are less pleasant than the hair is, he can cut the  <br/>
hair off. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to live with it.<br/>

<br/>
My dad MADE us wear shoes.  So we wouldn&#39;t get cut/sick/anything that  might <br/>
cost him money.<br/>
 <br/>
He would stomp really hard on our feet if he saw us without shoes on.<br/>
 <br/>
As an adult, I never ever wear shoes at home.  I wear shoes out mostly  <br/>
because it&#39;s required in stores and such.<br/>
 <br/>
I have been known to leave my shoes at different homes, quite by  accident.  <br/>
I always take my shoes off as soon as practical and I might get  a phone call <br/>
telling me I left my shoes, or I might look for them later and then  remember <br/>
where I left them.<br/>
 <br/>
So making kids wear shoes might make them LOOSE them.  Better reason  than my <br/>
father had for making us wear them.  Or just as good anyway.   And I bet no <br/>
one will stomp their feet and break their toes to remind them NOT  to wear them.<br/>

interested in their feet. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the child&#39;s age, just carrying their shoes for them in full<br/>
view of passers by defuses a lot of worry about cps. Also works for coats in<br/>
cold weather. If you smile and shrug, people may think you are &quot;teaching a<br/>
lesson through experience&quot; rather than just living freely, and may be more<br/>
humorous and light instead of judgmental.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if the child is asking why the adult is interested in their feet,<br/>
the adult could be likely to add &quot;cheeky and disrespectful&quot; to the catalog<br/>
of complaints. It is adding more negative energy to the situation of adults&#39;<br/>
meanness and judgmental attitudes. I agree that the adults own the problem<br/>
of their own feelings. Maybe Mom saying something like &quot;I&#39;m not worried<br/>
about them&quot; would help refocus the adult&#39;s attention. Of course that only<br/>
works if you are present!<br/>
<br/>
I think these &quot;issues&quot; are part of the spectrum of envy that we often have<br/>
to face. Envy from parents because we have so much less conflict with our<br/>
children about everyday stuff. Envy from kids because ours are not being<br/>
forced to do school or homework and get to watch tv/play/eat whenever. It is<br/>
impossible for me to change their feelings - they have to do that for<br/>
themselves. Sometimes I say something like, &quot;Yes, we&#39;re so lucky&quot;.<br/>
Expressing Gratitude helps defuse the envy.<br/>

<br/>
Sorta related.<br/>
<br/>
My dd, Jayn (5.5) has not allowed me to brush her hair since June of last<br/>
year. Her hair is fine and was curly (think Shirley Temple). It is now in<br/>
three matted wads, with dreadlock like strands poking out. We do wash it<br/>
with shampoo and conditioner periodically when she is willing, and rinse it<br/>
in water almost every day, so it is an odd combination of stiffness and<br/>
softness. It is now so matted that it is growing in such a way that when I<br/>
eventually cut the wads off, it will be untangled - almost all the ends are<br/>
now captured - but appears to be turning straighter, more like dh&#39;s slight<br/>
wave.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is very happy with her unusual hairstyle and loves putting clips and<br/>
ornaments into the front. She also wears hats and backwards or sideways<br/>
baseball caps on occasion. She needs an adult size to get over the wads. If<br/>
we are going somewhere that might be vaguely formal, she will let me put it<br/>
into a bun - an interesting but not impossible exercise.<br/>
<br/>
She has an outgoing personality, and is definitely &quot;cute&quot;, as against<br/>
&quot;pretty&quot;. Most people seem to accept her Phyllis Diller hair as part of her<br/>
specialness. <br/>
<br/>
However, I found myself doing two things that I didn&#39;t like. <br/>
<br/>
The first was with people (adults) I know, such as in my HS group, where<br/>
Jayn is pretty much odd-girl-out with her hair. It was telling them, as a<br/>
conversation about her hair may come up, about how I was ready with<br/>
conditioners and brushes for the moment that Jayn was willing to let me<br/>
&quot;fix&quot; her hair. Usually this would be a response to people having &quot;helpful<br/>
suggestions&quot; like particular products, but it came from my side, from a<br/>
desire to excuse myself - with the base assumption that her hair was some<br/>
kind of aberration or fault, that it was temporary, that it was an area that<br/>
I was &quot;allowing&quot; her to experiment. A sort of &quot;she&#39;s wrong but will come<br/>
round soon, and I&#39;m ready for when she does&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I have had to accept that this just isn&#39;t Jayn. She LOVES her wads.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing came from a place of me being a bit embarrassed in public<br/>
places amongst strangers - a body language version of the same ideas as<br/>
above. I would pick at her hair, as if trying to tidy it a bit - thereby<br/>
drawing even more attention to it, and to my discomfort. James (dh) was the<br/>
person who actually pointed out the activity to me, with strongly worded<br/>
exhortations to desist.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge for me has been to become genuinely acceptant of Jayn&#39;s hair,<br/>
rather than &quot;temporarily&quot; and superficially acceptant. That has been<br/>
facilitated by talking to her about it - and her emphatic expression of her<br/>
enjoyment of her hair. She tells me that she will let me cut her wads when<br/>
she is 100 years old. <br/>
<br/>
So now *if* anyone has a negative comment to me, I usually just say, &quot;Yes<br/>
she really loves her wads.&quot;<br/>

Where do you draw the line between induviduality and being  presentable<br/>
enough for society?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m delayed chiming in on this but twice in the past month, Logan (12) has  <br/>
been mistaken for a girl because of his long hair.  Once he and I were in  line <br/>
at the post office and an elderly man said, &quot;Your daughter is going to look  <br/>
just like you when she grows up.&quot;  Logan and I caught each other&#39;s eye and  <br/>
kept from laughing.  I knew it would probably embarrass the gentleman much  more <br/>
than Logan if we said anything so we just let it go.  We had a great  laugh <br/>
about it afterwards.  The other incident was at a hotel eating  breakfast when <br/>
an adjoining table asked if Logan and my niece (who has much  darker skin than <br/>
my son) were both my daughters.  I said...&quot;Logan is my son  and Cailin is my <br/>
niece&quot;  Both kids laughed about this later too.<br/>
 <br/>
When I asked Logan if this bothered him his response was, &quot;I like my hair  <br/>
and I don&#39;t much care what other people think about it.&quot;  He is quite  <br/>
comfortable with who he is and that seems to include his hair, the clothes he  wears <br/>
and his viewpoints on life.  <br/>
 <br/>
Neither of my children care much about clothes even my 15 year old  daughter. <br/>
They are happy in t-shirts and jeans.  It&#39;s an interesting  contrast in the <br/>
summer when my 3 stepkids are with us.  Two teen boys and a  12 year old girl <br/>
and they don&#39;t own anything that is not a popular name  brand.  All Abercrombie <br/>
 or Gap and very conscious of the type of  shoes they wear and hairstyles.  <br/>
Lots of comments about what is cool and  what isn&#39;t.  All public schooled and <br/>
live in an affluent  neighborhood.  My stepson just turned 16 and he got either <br/>
an Audi or a  Volvo.  Those are good cars  but it seems the brand names  are <br/>
most important to all of them.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s more about being in a public schooled setting with  <br/>
peer pressure or their family lifestyle.  It does seem important to many of  the <br/>
public schooled kids in our neighborhood also.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
Could be the combination of parents who bought into peer pressure and think  <br/>
it&#39;s a civilizing, reasonable thing, and encouraging their kids to care about  <br/>
what the other kids think, supporting their buying habits SO that they&#39;ll be  <br/>
&quot;popular at school,&quot; and it just snowballs in those cases, I think.<br/>
 <br/>
In some places it&#39;s hard to get away from that because even the greater  <br/>
culture is into the same kind of &quot;houses must match&quot; and &quot;cars must be new,&quot; but  <br/>
a cool thing about New Mexico is that because things don&#39;t rust, 30 year old  <br/>
cars are way feasible transport, and houses rarely match anyway.  In the  50&#39;s <br/>
tract neighborhoods the coolest thing is to customize house and yard.   I&#39;m <br/>
assuming that will be happening with the current-new silly neighborhoods  where <br/>
the houses are the same and about five feet apart.  They all look the  same <br/>
now, but it&#39;s still New Mexico.  Or maybe they&#39;ve signed covenants to  live <br/>
there that say they will not customize anything. &lt;G&gt;  (I doubt  it.)<br/>
 <br/>
Being creative in dress and hair is easier in northern New Mexico than in  <br/>
most part of the U.S., I&#39;m guessing, but I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to cheer my kids <br/>
 on to be different if we lived in SE New Mexico (a.k.a. &quot;Little Texas&quot;) <br/>
which is  a pocket of redneck conservatism.<br/>
 <br/>
Within any area some are more conservative than others, so a conservative  <br/>
family in a conservative area (where &quot;conservative&quot; means blending in with the  <br/>
prevailing mode of dress/lifestyle) will reward kids for any conservative  <br/>
tendencies.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby had long hair when he was little, cut it off after the one-too-many  <br/>
comments that he was in the wrong bathroom (not people being mean, just thinking <br/>
 honestly he wasn&#39;t a boy), and said he would grow it again when he had <br/>
facial  hair.  He grew it again before facial hair.  Once he had facial hair,  he <br/>
was wanting it cut more often.  He&#39;s never let anyone else cut it (I&#39;ve  <br/>
encouraged it that direction), but he wants me to do it.  Last week he  asked for <br/>
the back to be cut off and the front left longish, and I had doubts  but it <br/>
worked out fine.  Apparently the fear of someone saying &quot;mullet&quot; has  lots of <br/>
naturally-occuring hair growth being chopped off in back.  That too  shall pass.<br/>

Advice on this list helped me relax about my kid&#39;s hygiene.  Buying requested shampoos, etc., helped a lot too.  And then age kicks in.  Now I am trying to keep my mouth shut about how much hot water Lisa (12) is using for showers and shampooing!  Jackie typically bathes about once a week, but hasn&#39;t started to get greasy or stinky yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have a slightly different problem.  Lisa likes to wear tanktops and some of them do not completely cover her bra.  I can live with just the bra straps showing, even though it is a style that I don&#39;t care to wear myself.  Kind of funny, really, as I remember when having a bra strap poke out was embarrassing, but now bras come in lots of pretty colors and designs and exposed straps have become a fashion statement.<br/>
<br/>
Monday night we were going to an end of baseball season party for Jackie (YMCA league for 8-10 yo).  Lisa had on a purple tank top with lace around the top edge.  It barely covered the top of her bra, but not very well.  I asked her to change because I was concerned that some of the people at the party would be offended by a girl her age wearing a top that exposed her bra that much.  She did change, although she was pretty grumpy about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep my eye out for Gap jeans at thrift shops because for some reason the cut usually fits me very well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563243950">I say do not worry about what other people think - unless it is a rich <br/>
great aunt or someone who might decide not to leave you money! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With three daughters who are all very creative - now 14, 17, and 20 - <br/>
we&#39;ve been through all kinds of &quot;styles&quot; - and some seem inappropriate <br/>
to me. But they pass. Don&#39;t start having power struggles over clothing. <br/>
NOT worth it.<br/>
<br/>
The low-cut tank top thing is the style - bras show - they&#39;re MEANT to <br/>
show - that&#39;s why they&#39;re made in all those cool colors and patterns. <br/>
The layered look now INCLUDES the bra!<br/>
<br/>
So - I have a 14 yo wearing them, too.<br/>
<br/>
And my very very modest 17 yo got herself right to the edge of it - had <br/>
a little smidgen of bra showing the other day. You gotta KNOW this is a <br/>
very accepted style when she feels comfortable in it.<br/>

She may be too small for this idea to work, but: Travelsmith (a catalogue of<br/>
travel clothing and website) has really nice varieties of tank tops and<br/>
camisoles with built in bras in a wide range of fabrics and colors. Maybe<br/>
the smallest size would fit her and make the problem disappear. I bought a<br/>
ton of them because I can&#39;t go without a bra, and t-shirts often get too<br/>
hot, and I&#39;m just too old fashioned to like the visible bra strap look<br/>
unless the bras are pretty (meant to be seen), and I don&#39;t have any of<br/>
those.<br/>

Maybe dye some of her bras to match or coordinate with her favorite tanks,<br/>
to the effect is of layering??<br/>
<br/>
The broader issue of walking the line between child&#39;s autonomy, the fashion<br/>
practices that are peer accepted, and the social expectations of adults who<br/>
may be conservative or judgmental, is sometimes tough. <br/>
<br/>
Worrying excessively about other people&#39;s opinions is something that is a<br/>
personal growth challenge for me. In a similar situation my task would be to<br/>
examine my reaction closely to make sure I was being reasonable and accurate<br/>
rather than letting my personal timidity or paranoia take over. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-754661276">On the subject of shoes (or *not* wearing them),  I used to insist all the<br/>
kids wear them in stores and restaurants because, &quot;The store requires that<br/>
we wear shoes &quot; or something like that.  I tried to point out the little<br/>
signs that I remember seeing in windows saying &quot;no shoes no shirt no<br/>
service&quot; or whatever but surprisingly, maybe just where we live, there don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be any.  <br/>
<br/>
My 11yo and 9yo wear them to go in stores but the 4yo doesn&#39;t want to put<br/>
them on.  So, if there is no sign I might offer to carry a pair of flip fops<br/>
in my purse just in case a store manager or someone asks her to  put on some<br/>
shoes.  No one ever has.  I remember once in a grocery store being told they<br/>
could ride in the cart barefooted so that&#39;s been the rule there but just<br/>
about everywhere else we&#39;ve been surprised by how little anyone cared.  It&#39;s<br/>
a beach community too though so it&#39;s not too unusual to see peaople walking<br/>
around in bathing suits.</div>
