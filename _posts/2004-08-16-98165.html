<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454710267">For me, I don&#39;t let my 3 year old watch<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; stuff that I know has violence in it or stuff that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; sexually explicit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we do not restrict tv viewing for my dd. (can&#39;t remember if i ever watched <br/>
tv when she was less than 2 because i think i was to busy)<br/>
my daughter will regulate herself on what she can see and what she can&#39;t. if <br/>
something is violent she will cover her eyes and say turn it off i can&#39;t <br/>
watch this.<br/>
my dh was always worried about sex on tv. i remember one time when during a <br/>
movie you could tell a couple was having sex even though you couldn&#39;t see <br/>
anything and my daughter said &quot;what are they doing?&quot; i said &quot;having sex&quot; and <br/>
she said &quot;oh, i didn&#39;t know you could do that when your not married.&quot; my dh <br/>
was so uncomfortable but my dd didn&#39;t think it was a big deal.<br/>
so for our family the tv restriction would be more for my dh&#39;s benefit of <br/>
not answering questions that make him uncomfortable than for my dd sake.<br/>
this opened up a lot of conversation for us that may have never been <br/>
discussed if she felt it was an off limits topic.<br/>
