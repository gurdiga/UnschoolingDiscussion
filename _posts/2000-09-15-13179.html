I totally forgot DS had sewn several little bags with handles when he was 6.  <br/>
Gee, this project will be even easier than I thought, the kid already knows <br/>
how to operate the sewing machine.  No wonder he has been so impatient with <br/>
me.  Here I am thinking I&#39;ve got to start from scratch and he&#39;s already had <br/>
the basics.<br/>
