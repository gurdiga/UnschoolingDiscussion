<div><font color="#800080"><br>I appreciate hearing about everyones messy 
homes!&nbsp; I<br>know I shouldn&#39;t expect kids to be neat. I do provide<br>a 
house that says yes to them.&nbsp; We have baskets and<br>containers galore. The 
dining room in our small<br>apartment is not where we eat its the kids play 
room. <br>I wasn&#39;t prepared for the kitchen 
exploration<br>play/science.<br><br>I am going to put all kinds of things 
together in a<br>science box and keep it in the 
bathroom!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</font></div>

<div><font color="#800080">I too have a 5yo, but my dd is a neat freak, no messy 
hands, etc - I think I was too anal when she was a baby.....</font></div>
<div><font color="#800080"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#800080">How about you buy her her own food coloring etc - I 
have bought them at garage sales(from folks I know), and we use those for 
crafts.&nbsp; Dana loves to make things, so we have loads of &quot;craft boxes&quot; where 
she keeps all of her glue, scissors, scraps, paint, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
also give her the christmas/birthday cards whenever the holiday is over and we 
reuse them as collages, or places to put the lovely glitter glue.&nbsp; I have 
yet to allow her to go hog wild with things like flour, water and sugar - but I 
do let her be right in the mix when I am baking/cooking.</font></div>
<div><font color="#800080"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#800080">One thing I have noticed of late, she is getting quite 
good at drawing and coloring - it has been really fun watching the process 
evolve.&nbsp; Hey, what do you all do with all the artwork??&nbsp; I have so 
much, we are about to become a firehazard - she generates at least 10 
masterpieces a day - but I hate to throw the stuff away unless it is torn to 
shreds or wrecked beyond repair.&nbsp; </font></div>

  artwork, but fortunately he has a real Zen attitude - he has no need to hang 
  on to &#39;things&#39; , in fact I often have to keep him from discarding things that 
  I think will be useful later.&nbsp; So it&#39;s really my problem when it comes to 
  saving his art.&nbsp; With the Holidays&nbsp;though I&#39;ve been using his 
  drawings as wrapping paper, or cutting them up for note cards (he enjoys this 
  idea, I only do it with his approval.)&nbsp; I do intend to get a storage unit 
  though for the pieces we decide to keep. Other times I stick some on the 
  refrig, then in a week or so I silently replace it with a new 
  &#39;masterpiece.&#39;&nbsp; And my house is still a mess, so maybe I&#39;m the wrong 
  person to answer this.......</font></div>

<br/>
My kids, now 15 through 27, really enjoy looking through their old <br/>
artwork scrapbooks together, and I&#39;m always amazed at how much detail <br/>
they remember about when they did certain pictures, right down to <br/>
what the weather was like on that day!<br/>

re older and  they want to be in charge of keeping<br/>
their own portfolios of thier masterpeices they can<br/>
store all they want.  For now we turn it into gifts<br/>
for the family, wrapping paper, and cards.<br/>
<br/>
We have what call the art dresser which is full of<br/>
fabric, yarn, egg carton, empty tp rolls, tape, glue<br/>
etc. Each child has their own sewing basket that has<br/>
special yarn and scraps of fabric.  I keep things for<br/>
sewing in a handy place too so when I pick up my<br/>
sewing they can sew too. Dd can thread and knot her<br/>
own needle now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992126224">I give them a folder to keep it in, and they decide what gets kept ad <br/>
what doesn&#39;t.  It&#39;s their work, not mine, but if they give something to <br/>
me, it goes in a file in my filing cabinet drawer.  We work from <br/>
home, so we have one of those :-)  Handy for anything A4-size or <br/>
smaller... but not for the sculpture downstairs with the twig <br/>
carefully glued upright on the piece of paper...<br/>

(for a 3 year old, anyway)drawings and pictures<br/>
galore. Her favorite activity is going and putting it<br/>
on the fridge when she&#39;s done. I just keep all the<br/>
magnets down low and she does it on her own. Which<br/>
proves to be its own activity, cuz each magnet has to<br/>
be placed just right before she&#39;s happy with the whole<br/>
piece of art. And when the fridge is full, I take down<br/>
the oldest ones to make room for the newer ones, and<br/>
either put them in my keepsakes box or send them to<br/>
out of town relatives and friends, depending on how<br/>
many there are. Sometimes I&#39;ll ask her what she wants<br/>
to say to them and write her little message on the<br/>
back of it for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58296561">Also, the ones I keep I may not remember what they are<br/>
exactly when I pull them out later, so I ask her for<br/>
sure to tell me about the picture and then I write a<br/>
few small discreetwords to jog my memory about it in<br/>
the corner, on the back. Makes it much more worth<br/>
keeping to me. And her, when she&#39;s older and drawing a<br/>
dog much better and differently than she did last<br/>
year.<br/>
