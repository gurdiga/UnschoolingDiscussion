and select JC Superstar from the dropdown menu, it will show the cities on <br/>
the tour. Sebastian Bach is starring in this, which is interesting to this <br/>
80&#39;s child who remembers him from Skid Row(the band). As I said, my mom got <br/>
this for us. She gets season tickets to the broadway series in Columbus every <br/>
year and gets opportunities to get tickets early. Funny thing is, I OD&#39;d on <br/>
broadway as a child from all the exposure from my mom. I grew up with the <br/>
soundtrack from A Chorus Line blaring through the house, cursewords and all <br/>
LOL. I went to see one of the last productions in the Shubert Theatre back in <br/>
89 or 90 in New York when I was a senior on a high school drama club trip.  <br/>
