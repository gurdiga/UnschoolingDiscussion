<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036640311">I&#39;m hoping someone here knows something about fish tanks.<br/>
<br/>
My son has 3 goldfish in a 10 gallon aquarium tank, and we have an out of control algae problem.

The goldfish are just small &quot;feeder fish&quot; (maybe 2 inches in length), and have a ton of room in there.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724906202">Gold fish seem to be rather &quot;dirty&quot; fish if you get my meaning.  When we had <br/>
gold fish they created a lot of waste LOL.  We still have fish but not the <br/>
gold fish kind.  10 gallon tank should be plenty.  <br/>
<br/>
The only other things we do that you didn&#39;t mention are to check the pH once <br/>
a week and adjust as needed.  And we add Stress Zyme to ours that contains <br/>
live bacteria.  The bottle says in part that it &quot;assures a healthy biological <br/>
filter, good water quality, and a clean aquarium.<br/>
<br/>
Also we have a placostamus (?spelling).  &quot;sucker fish&quot; that helps keep the <br/>
glass clean.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;HELP!!  My son is quite attached to these fish, and is upset that he can&#39;t<br/>

them!  Thanks to anyone who has experience with this sort of thing!  I kept<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You have either one of two things happening, too much light or too much food<br/>
for the algae. (waste from the fish) People say goldfish are very dirty and<br/>
the water is full of ammonia. I have a 30 gal tank full of fancy goldfish<br/>
only and never have any problems. I also have a light on the tank that I<br/>
keep on every evening. I test my water weekly and every 4-6 weeks do a water<br/>
change. Only about 25-30% at the most. It&#39;s a matter of feeding the fish.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to use any chemicals, start by doing water changes. Do a<br/>
water change every day, 20% ONLY and no more. Condition the new water and<br/>
make sure the temp is the same when you add it. Keep doing this until the<br/>
water is clear. You can clean off the algae with a scraper ahead of time so<br/>
the vacuum gets the fallen algae. You said you have no light. Is the tank<br/>
near a sunny window? Does it get lots of natural light? If so, moving the<br/>
tank will help. If not, cut down on how much you feed the fish. Most people<br/>
over feed fish. Goldfish are pigs and will act starving every minute of the<br/>
day. You can feed the fish once or even 3 times day as long as it&#39;s not too<br/>
much. Feed very, very small amounts and make sure the fish are eating what<br/>
you feed. Once you see flakes or crumbs falling onto the rocks, stop<br/>
feeding. If you use flake food, try one flake at a time. That should do the<br/>
trick as you say you are changing the filter too.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get it under control, you can buy a pleco if you want also. I like<br/>
the pleco&#39;s better than the algae eaters. He&#39;ll take care of any excess as<br/>
long as it&#39;s not too much. Then a 25 % water change once a month should do<br/>
the trick. Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28264073">Hi Shelley,<br/>
<br/>
Unless you want to get a lighting system (expensive) that kills algae, I<br/>
suggest you get a heater (if you don&#39;t have one, & place a species called a<br/>
&quot;Pleco&quot; in the tank. You can buy a small Pleco and as they grow, trade with<br/>
your pet store for smaller ones. They are amazing algae eaters and<br/>
interesting fish. They do need heat if you don&#39;t already have a heater in<br/>
the tank. They won&#39;t bother your goldfish and hide during the day under<br/>
rocks, etc... They are not at all expensive and will take care of your algae<br/>
problem in no time. You&#39;ll only need one with such a small tank.<br/>

Unless you have a really cold house for quite awhile, pleco&#39;s and a lot of<br/>
other fish don&#39;t need heaters. I have no heaters on my tanks and my fish do<br/>
fine when our temps go down to the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. Keeping the house warm and<br/>
pretty steady is all that is needed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232782023">We have a sucker-mouth catfish to keep our glass clean. If the water is <br/>
also cloudy, you&#39;re probably overfeeding. Our book said to feed the fish <br/>
only as much as they&#39;d eat in 3 minutes, twice a day. It also said to <br/>
NOT feed them one day a week, and not if you&#39;re going out of town for <br/>
less than a week. We went away for 4 days and came back to a *beautiful* <br/>
tank. No cloudiness, no algae.<br/>
<br/>
They said the algae grows on the overfeeding and will also grow more <br/>
with plenty of light (like sunlight).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152961514">Thanks very much for all the answers!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the tank does get direct sunlight in the afternoon -- I was suspecting that might be part of the problem.  I will try moving it to another locale.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the specifics about % water changes to do, Mary. Could you please explain what you mean by &quot;conditioning&quot; the water before I add it?  I haven&#39;t done pH testing, etc (was trying to be simple this time around, cuz they&#39;re &quot;just&quot; goldfish --- am starting to think I would have been better off setting up an entire tropical tank!).<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll be off to find a pleco! (Any excuse for a new critter, LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686838673">you can try and control the problem naturally--add some plecostomus (not sure if that&#39;s spelled right, but they&#39;re algae eaters) or some snails. both of those will eat the algae, and I&#39;m sure there are other fish of the same appetite that I&#39;m not thinking of at the moment. hope that helps.<br/>

I use water straight from the tap, that I add a water conditioner purchased at the pet store.  (Just ask at the pet shop, they&#39;ll know what you mean.)  Our tap water is fairly cold in the winter and warmish in the summer, but I figure that water temperatures in nature vary too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I also use tap water and just use Amquel to condition it. The conditioner<br/>
takes out the chlorine, chloramines and ammonia from any water. I wait about<br/>
15 minutes before I add the new water but if it&#39;s less than a gallon I wait<br/>
only about 5 minutes. There was a time when my county water could be added<br/>
to the tank without any conditioning at all. That was years ago and those<br/>
days are gone. When bringing home new fish or after a stressful situation, I<br/>
use Stress Coat instead of the Amquel. It does the same thing but also adds<br/>
a slime coat for the fish to fight disease and stress.<br/>
<br/>
I just recently got the cutest little 2.5 tank for the girls room. It&#39;s teal<br/>
and the whole kit came with everything except gravel and plants for $22.00.<br/>
It even has a little light. It&#39;s a beta tank and has a plastic grill that<br/>
can fit down the middle of the tank separating the two sides. So one can<br/>
keep 2 bettas in one tank. We got it because we have an especially nasty<br/>
platy that chases and traumatizes every fish he&#39;s ever been with. So now<br/>
he&#39;s on one side and we have a new Mickey Mouse platy on the other side.<br/>
Brand new tank and both doing well.<br/>

Thanks too to everyone who suggested overfeeding as a possibililty. I know that&#39;s not it, I hardly feed these guys anything (and as a result they&#39;ve not grown much since we&#39;ve had them -- about 10 mos).  I&#39;m confused as to why this problem started so long after we set up the tank, but am thinking that the change of the position of the sun and the overall increase in room temperature probably had something to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for the input!<br/>

<br/>
Have you been using the well water for the tanks without treating it? If so,<br/>
and the fish are fine, then no need to worry about it now. Goldfish are<br/>
especially hearty and can endure a lot. The only thing I have heard about<br/>
well water has to do with vertain gases in the water. That these gases, not<br/>
sure what they are, can alter ph. So you have a high ph and then it<br/>
decreases quickly. Certain fish would be real sensitive to that. If you<br/>
haven&#39;t had any problems, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it now. Maybe if you ever<br/>
consider other fish though, let the well water set for a couple of hours<br/>
first before adding it to the tank.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Snails are good too. Then only bad thing I&#39;ve heard about snails is they are<br/>
very prolific. Before you know it, you can have a whole tank of snails. The<br/>
last fish we got had a couple of small snails in the bag. When I asked about<br/>
them, the guy just said that the fish may eat them, they were small, and if<br/>
not, just keep a watch on them. If there got to be too many, take them out.<br/>
No big deal really.<br/>

Your welcome. You should be fine then.<br/>
Today Joe and I went to Petsmart to get a small fish tank for a birthday<br/>
present. Well $60.00 later, and no not all on the present, we were checking<br/>
out. I swiped the debit card and punched in numbers so fast, Joe just looked<br/>
at me and said, &quot;shop here a lot????&quot; I shudder to see how much I spend<br/>
there. One or two new fish die, I take them back and get a few dollars<br/>
credit, new replacement fish and then add on another 20-30 dollars. It never<br/>
fails!!! I love Petsmart and my critters!!!<br/>
