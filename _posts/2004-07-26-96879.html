 </span></blockquote>Generally collectible coins you&#39;re not supposed to clean since old coins are<br/>
supposed to look old and new coins you don&#39;t want to scratch or pit. If<br/>
there&#39;s gunk on them (as opposed to the patina of age) the About.com guy<br/>
(and many others) suggests distilled water, distilled water and a bit of<br/>
soap, olive oil soak, rubbing alcohol or vaseline.<br/>
<br/>
So, don&#39;t drink distilled water.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t drink soapy water.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t eat (or drink!) olive oil.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t drink rubbing alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t eat Vaseline,<br/>
<br/>
since they&#39;re all used as cleaning substances.<br/>
<br/>
One site recommended hot melt glue to get into crevices and then pull it off<br/>
when it hardens.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t eat that either.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In most cases coins should not be cleaned at all as doing so may reduce a<br/>
&gt; coin&#39;s numismatic value. If cleaning is advisable, here are some steps to<br/>
&gt; follow. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Consult a coin dealer or other coin expert to assist you in deciding whether<br/>
&gt; cleaning a particular coin is a good idea. When in doubt, do not clean the<br/>
&gt; coin at all. If you decide to clean a coin, first try out any coin cleaning<br/>
&gt; method on a cheap coin to see the results.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Always use non-abrasive cleaners such as rubbing alcohol or olive oil to clean<br/>
&gt; coins. Commercial jewelry and metal polishes are usually too harsh. Rinse the<br/>
&gt; coins with distilled water after cleaning. Tap water should not be used as it<br/>
&gt; contains minerals which may create spots. Tarnished coins should only be<br/>
&gt; cleaned (if at all) by a professional using a process known as &quot;dripping&quot;. Let<br/>
&gt; coins air-dry after cleaning - never rub a coin dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soaking in olive oil or mild soapy water can often safely remove dirt or other<br/>
&gt; substances adhering to a coin. Specially made commercial coin cleaners are<br/>
&gt; available at most coin supply shops but tend to be rather expensive.<br/>

I think at least wait until it&#39;s cold if you have a serious urge to eat it.<br/>

One day in fourth grade some of us polished pennies with the mercury from a <br/>
broken thermometer.   One of the kids had brought a little plastic box with the <br/>
mercury rolling around in there in little balls.  It was GLORIOUS.  It didn&#39;t <br/>
stick to the plastic, just to itself, but we were able to make it stick to <br/>
the pennies by rubbing it on with our fingers.  They looked like dimes!  <br/>
<br/>
Of course we had mercury-coated fingertips, and there was only cold water in <br/>
the bathroom, and we couldn&#39;t have asked the teacher for help because then we <br/>
would get in trouble for coating pennies instead of paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s okay.  We had no idea mercury was bad for us, so we just went to <br/>
lunch and ate and didn&#39;t wash our hands until we got home, or the next day, or <br/>
whenever.<br/>
<br/>
The pennies were pretty, and it was fun, but I don&#39;t recommend it.<br/>
