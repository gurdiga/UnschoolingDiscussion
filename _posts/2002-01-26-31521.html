<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796107371">Amidst all the emotions and expectations on this list<br/>
I think it should be noted that people -- mothers, in<br/>
particular -- who are strong enough and eccentric<br/>
enough to take and/or keep their children out of<br/>
school in this society are going to amass a body of<br/>
knowledge and are going to have opinions as well, and<br/>
WILL express them.  This is called sharing.  Not all<br/>
of us are good at the subtleties and not all of us are<br/>
without defensiveness.  There is a particularly rare<br/>
art to expressing thought precisely in text without<br/>
sounding brash OR hollow.  I&#39;ve always told my girls<br/>
that we must listen politely to loud bossy folks,<br/>
because they usually mean well and because we must<br/>
choose our own behavior instead of reacting in kind,<br/>
and then we can go on and do what we  believe is best.<br/>
 We feel no guilt over disagreeing with anyone and we<br/>
offer no apologies, although I do often EXPLAIN<br/>
myself, which is my way of sharing what I know and<br/>
think. I&#39;ve come to understand over time that the<br/>
highest (and most difficult) form of love we can<br/>
express in the world is forgiveness.  It&#39;s okay to let<br/>
people have their say, it&#39;s okay not to listen to or<br/>
read every word, and it&#39;s always okay not to answer. <br/>
There&#39;s room for us all. <br/>
