didn&#39;t read well feel bad that they couldn&#39;t read enough books.  So they<br/>
weren&#39;t keeping track or giving rewards or anything.<br/>

Hmmmm.  A summer reading program with no book reading.....sounds like the<br/>
military came up with it, doesn&#39;t it!?  Yikes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our library had a reading scheme too. Read x number of books and <br/>
you get a pizza. I tried to sign up but they wouldn&#39;t let me. Seems <br/>
like they are ageist or you&#39;re meant to stop reading when you hit 18 <br/>
or something :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Simple way our libraries deal with that - kids can either count books or<br/>
time spent reading.  I think a short book or chapter gets about the same as<br/>
30 minutes.  Not that I&#39;m in favour of rewards for reading, but at least<br/>
that makes it fair to the slower readers.<br/>
