<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060642065">----- Ah,  Jacli....<br/>
Thanks for this story.  It parallels my own struggle with my dd&#39;s inablity<br/>
to read.  Her bd is tomorrow...10th that is.  My fingers are crossed.......I<br/>
am waiting,  sometimes patiently,  sometimes not,  for her to WANT to read.<br/>
I&#39;m still shocked that she hasn&#39;t wanted too yet.....This has been *my* most<br/>
challenging struggle!<br/>

I&#39;m pretty *out* of discussions for awhile....too much celebrating around<br/>
here!!<br/>
<br/>
hey,, anybody here that song  9/11?...it&#39;s Silent Night playing with a<br/>
voice-over of &quot;God&quot; telling  where She/He was ...just heard it today.  Very<br/>
heart-wrenching....but it helped as I am still filled with grief,<br/>
especially with the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Yes Yes!!  a little background first...<br/>
I taught myself to read at 5.  I began reading to my<br/>
daughter while she was in the womb.<br/>
By the time she was a year old she had 3 libraries,<br/>
English, Italian and Spanish.  It was a huge thorn<br/>
in my side that she couldn&#39;t read.  I got more and more<br/>
frustrated.  Wasted more and more money on stuff like<br/>
Hooked on Phonics ,etc.  Finally realized she did not want<br/>
to read.  That was even harder to accept. But on her 10th<br/>
birthday she decided she did want to read and has been<br/>
going strong ever since.  EXCEPT... Here she is reading all<br/>
sorts of books and comprehending and writing the best darn<br/>
book reports, etc but she has the worst spelling.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand how she could read so well and spell so<br/>
poorly.  But one day recently I realized we work on her<br/>
spelling via phonics and with her accent she simply can&#39;t<br/>
hear half the vowels.<br/>
She was born in Massachusetts, on the South Shore.  Not<br/>
only does she not hear vowels in some cases she doesn&#39;t<br/>
hear consonants either!  For instance the word -better-.<br/>
She honestly hears -beDDer-.  She drops letters at the ends<br/>
of words adds some on to others - it&#39;s SOooo frustrating -<br/>
for both of us.  To make matters worse by the time she was<br/>
4 she was in a speech therapy class for almost 2 years,<br/>
being taught by a woman with an even worse accent than dd<br/>
already had!  Now the stuff is ingrained.</div>

then 12.  &lt;g&gt;  Then I made what I consider a mistake and pushed the issue <br/>
after he turned 12.  I insisted on doing phonics with him every day.  We <br/>
lasted several months, and he did get a pretty good grip on phonics.  It <br/>
also soured our relationship for a time, and he still reads very slowly and <br/>
almost painfully.  If I had it to do over, I would have waited it out.<br/>
