&gt; &lt;&lt;With a six month old, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a pervert. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now when he&#39;s six YEARS old, I might raise my eyebrows. &lt;g&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, now just out of curiousity because I haven&#39;t known of anyone having<br/>
&gt; sex while their child actually watched. When do you draw the line???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t worry about having sex with a baby sleeping in the same room. I<br/>
would have been pretty uncomfortable with a baby actually *watching* though<br/>
(I don&#39;t even like the dog to watch, LOL).<br/>
<br/>
I drew the line of having them even asleep in the same room at about the age<br/>
when they were starting to notice things beyond &quot;right in front of their<br/>
faces&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember when that was. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

No of course when the babies are sleeping, I don&#39;t mind. Except for having <br/>
to be quiet so we don&#39;t wake them!! We&#39;ve always had our babies in our room <br/>
until at least 6 months. That&#39;s usually when mine start to look around and <br/>
&quot;really&quot; watch. Our last was with us longer but I still made sure she was <br/>
asleep and with how she was situated, she couldn&#39;t really see anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I took the original post as the baby actually watching out of curiousity as <br/>
to what was going on. That I woldn&#39;t be comfortable with as well as teaching <br/>
my kids sex by having them watch.<br/>
