<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985608476"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Yol, Vishnu & Shanti&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bluelotus@...">bluelotus@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;What about state regulations and unschooling? Do you keep *records*<br/>
&gt; through the interpretation of what your child is learning to show state<br/>
&gt; officials?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That would depend on what state you lived in. Here in FL, you can register<br/>
&gt; with a non public school and not worry about record keeping or keep a<br/>
&gt; portfolio if you are registered with the school board as a homeschooler. The<br/>
&gt; portfolio&#39;s for unschoolers are very non schooly with a lot of pictures.<br/>

<br/>
So I guess there&#39;s no way out of *exams* in this life for unschoolers, eh?  Oh well...<br/>

Most people think there&#39;s no way out of school.<br/>
<br/>
You went one step.  Maybe you can figure out a way to avoid the other.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never taken a standardized test yet.  (Nor any non- or <br/>
sub-standard things either, not counting the little quizzes at humor sites.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717088452">I will certainly try to avoid them! I believe they do nothing but harm. Unless you understand it&#39;s a game, of course, which goes along the lines of your article. I totally agree with that.<br/>

Thanks Heidi! You made my day. I should go back to those state regulations and read them more thoroughly, I guess. I&#39;m not in a hurry, I still have 3 years without that kind of stuff.<br/>
Do you get to pick the tests too, or is there a specific *standard* to follow?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

Yes you can pick the tests yourself, I just always get the CAT, I have never<br/>
seen any other. Does anyone out there know if there are any &quot;easier&quot;<br/>
different tests out there?<br/>
Thanks<br/>
