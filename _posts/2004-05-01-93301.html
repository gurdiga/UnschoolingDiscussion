Instead, they learned to swim first by being with their friends in the water every day...<br/>

and Second, by being on the swim team.  Even my son, who was 13 at the time, finally perfected his stroke by being on the swim team.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238965792">My children always WANT to be involved in swimming lessons.  They&#39;ve <br/>
done so for as long as they can remember. I  don&#39;t make them, they look <br/>
forward to it, and are very involved in how often, etc.  We usually have <br/>
swimming lessons all summer long, so I think five sessions, two weeks <br/>
each.  Last year we did less, because of traveling, mostly, and we were <br/>
busy.  Last year Lexie volunteered at the pool.  It was rather funny how <br/>
it came about.  Lexie had seen other older kids volunteering, and wanted <br/>
to do so.  We asked.  I was told by the very young swim instructor in <br/>
the office &quot;she&#39;s only eight, absolutely not, never, volunteers must be <br/>
12.&quot;  I said &quot;are there ever any exceptions?&quot;  She said, well I guess <br/>
there could be if the director of that city pool said it was OK.&quot;  So I <br/>
asked her to ask the director (whom we had known for a few years.  The <br/>
girl walked over to the director who is in the pool and asked, &quot;Can an <br/>
eight year old volunteer?&quot;  The director said &quot;Nope, they need to be <br/>
12,&quot;  Then she noticed us waiting and said &quot;oh wait, are you talking <br/>
about Lexie volunteering.  Yeah, she can, what hours can she do this, <br/>
and for how long?&quot;  Once she heard it was Lexie, she knew it would be <br/>
fine!  Lexie volunteered about three hours a day, for a few weeks, <br/>
before we left for our vacation.  It gave her more time in the water, <br/>
she was helping the level 1 swimmers, and she did great.  They assigned <br/>
her one kid for a class who did NOT want to get in the water.  Lexie was <br/>
loving and gentle and by the end of the two week session that child was <br/>
going under the water and would only work with Lexie.  It was quite a <br/>
wonderful thing to see. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, to me, doesn&#39;t mean an absence of formal classes.  Instead, <br/>
it simply means following a child&#39;s lead.  Lexie is currently involved <br/>
in a rather formal film class, with kids from ages 9 to 18.  Guess who <br/>
the 9 year old is?  Yep, Lexie.  There are weekly meetings, homework, <br/>
etc. as they write dialogue, scenes, figure out what props, etc. they <br/>
will need, etc.  Lexie is the only girl in the group, which is fine with <br/>
her, because the star of their movie is a girl, and of course she got <br/>
that part.  Even though she&#39;s the youngest, she is expected to do her <br/>
part, just as the other kids are. <br/>

My son refused lessons, even though dh had been a lifeguard and swimming <br/>
teacher and could have offered personalized instruction.  My son worked <br/>
pretty industriously on developing his skills &quot;by himself&quot;, but with our <br/>
supervision.  Occasionally he would tolerate a tip on technique from his <br/>
dad, but mostly he worked things out in his own way.  He got pretty <br/>
proficient.<br/>
<br/>
Should I ever waver in my unschooling faith, you all have my permission <br/>
to remind me that doing it himself is my son&#39;s deeply ingrained <br/>
preference.  I&#39;d be stupid to go against the grain.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79833373">It&#39;s too small a sample and there could be other factors, but of my three <br/>
children, Kirby has had the most lessons and is the worst swimmer and the least <br/>
interested in or willing to swim for fun.  Marty, middle and middle.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was too short when she went to lessons, and didn&#39;t like them, but she <br/>
had friends with a pool at their apartment, and their dad was willingto go down <br/>
and play with them in the water anytime any of them wanted to.  Holly is the <br/>
best and bravest swimmer.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad used to take her every Friday to a public pool where she would do <br/>
nearly nothing except jump off the high dive over and over.<br/>
<br/>
When they went to a family outing, Marty rode a jetski and Holly was jumping <br/>
into Elephant Butte Lake off a pontoon boat over and over, and she and Marty <br/>
pulled the boat in the water, just to see if they could.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty brave.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the desert and swimming isn&#39;t an everyday thing except for people <br/>
who work at pools or are on swim teams.<br/>
<br/>
I think that with other things, lessons can work against learning and joy.  <br/>
Watch and feel how the child is responding and go by that.<br/>

My first daughter horsed around in the pool that was at my mom&#39;s complex.<br/>
She always had her little swimmies and gradually asked for them not to be<br/>
blown up all the way. When my husband and I took her to Daytona one year,<br/>
there she was, swimming in the pool at the hotel. Little head barely above<br/>
water but she was doing it. She was 5-6 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
With my younger kids, my SIL was always, every year, informing me about<br/>
swimming lessons at a local high school pool. From the time Joseph was born,<br/>
she was telling me about the lessons. When the kids were old enough to<br/>
understand, I would ask them if they wanted to go. They never did. And every<br/>
time I saw my SIL at my other SIL&#39;s house, where there was a pool and our<br/>
kids were in with their swimmies, she would tell me, AGAIN, about the<br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
I never learned to swim until I was 14. I had lessons. They terrified me and<br/>
my mom pulled me out. I learned on my own when we got a pool. I saw Tara<br/>
learn on her own too. Never had any doubts the other 3 would do anything but<br/>
learn when they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
We moved into a larger house over 3 years ago. We have a pool. We have a<br/>
pool fence. Alyssa is 3 and doesn&#39;t know how to swim. She knows to stay away<br/>
from the pool no matter what if her swimmies aren&#39;t on. She knows to stay<br/>
outside the fence if it&#39;s opened.<br/>
<br/>
The first year we were here, the two middle kids learned to swim. We moved<br/>
here in Aug. and they were swimming on their own that same month. They are<br/>
fish now. They know water safety and what not to do and what to do if<br/>
there&#39;s a problem. We talk about that here. We go over it frequently. I have<br/>
no doubt Alyssa will learn on her own just like the others did.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve already made a great move by letting him ASK for the lessons.  Follow <br/>
his lead and see where it goes.<br/>
<br/>
My DS (6) has been a fish from birth but still hasn&#39;t gotten into the formal <br/>
lesson thing, I&#39;ve asked but he&#39;s not really interested.  We have a pool, so <br/>
he gets what he needs that way.  He&#39;s had a lot of fun over the years jumping, <br/>
trying to swim, and, just playing in the water.  We thought we should put him <br/>
in lessons since we got this house because the safety issue is there everyday <br/>
but we&#39;ve never had a reason to worry because so far we are always with the <br/>
kids in the yard and we&#39;ve done the CPR thing, and the pool has no open access.  <br/>
Now he has a MAJOR interest in diving and he has begun asking about taking <br/>
lessons for that but I&#39;m not sure how young formal lessons start for that.<br/>
<br/>
I think letting them explore the water and enjoy it, that&#39;s the main thing.  <br/>
A friend of mine was determined to make her kids safe in the water, especially <br/>
since we have a pool and invite them for swims, so she forces lessons on her <br/>
two kids and her DD loves going in the pool (but doesn&#39;t really like her <br/>
lessons) but her DS doesn&#39;t enjoy it at all, so when he comes over he justs plays <br/>
in the yard.  So it&#39;s for the kids, let them decide.<br/>
<br/>
And whether it&#39;s something in your area all-year-round or you&#39;re freezing <br/>
your booty off in Alaska, if the interest is there, that&#39;s what makes it <br/>
relevant.  There&#39;s always indoor pools.  Safety is always a concern around water but <br/>
being watchful helps and instead of &quot;training&quot; a child, we can always start by <br/>
preparing ourselves with CPR and all that.<br/>

<br/>
Swimmies are dangerous.  They give kids a false sense of security, <br/>
parents too!  Kids who use them are most likely to drown, in my <br/>
opinion.  They do not understand how their body reacts with and floats <br/>
in water.  If they ever did fall in without their floaties they would be <br/>
unable to deal with the water, as they would feel different in the water <br/>
without the swimmies. <br/>
<br/>
My girls were both strong swimmers before the age of four.  Janene could <br/>
swim at 9 months, no lessons, just put her int he water and she swam.  <br/>
Lexie was 18 months when she first went in, and she was also a natural <br/>
swimmer.  Their early lessons were simply being in the water with mommy <br/>
or daddy and other babies, playing and learning important things like <br/>
&quot;fall in, turn around immediatley&quot;  (Children drown because they fall in <br/>
and see the other side of the pool and try to get to it, never realizing <br/>
that if they simply turned around the edge would be within an arms <br/>
length.)  I think young babies often are natural swimmers, and as long <br/>
as water play continues to happen (without flotations) through out the <br/>
toddler and preschool years.  At nine, lexie is as water safe as can be <br/>
(there really is no such thing) and Janene will be so in another few <br/>
years.  They are strong swimmers.  They never used a flotation device <br/>
besides a noodle, and that was for water play, not safety.  I practice <br/>
constant supervision, and constant swimming (hard to learn to swim if <br/>
you only swim every so often.)<br/>
<br/>
btw, Sandra, I was raised in NM and we were swimming a few times a week <br/>
or more often, year round.  I was on swim team for a while, but even <br/>
when we weren&#39;t on swim team we swam all the time.  My mother is very <br/>
into water, and for a whiel she and I swam every morning at 6am at the <br/>
local high school.  It was a good time.  I should do that again.<br/>

maybe water safety/swimming falls somewhere between the have-to absolute <br/>

other <br/>
sports skills?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
We have a pool, so we can swim every day. Duncan (8) has never had a lesson. <br/>
He swims like a fish. <br/>
<br/>
We have friends that have had lessons every summer---but still have to have <br/>
lessons every summer. They&#39;re fearful of the &quot;deep end&quot;, even though the <br/>
&quot;shallow end&quot; is over the littlun&#39;s head! When they&#39;re little, why even *mention* <br/>
the different ends? It&#39;s ALL deep to a three year old!<br/>
<br/>
Duncan flies off the dive and dives to the bottom for pennies. He&#39;s as <br/>
comfortable in the water as out. <br/>
<br/>
In our experience, it&#39;s all about how much time you spend in the water, NOT <br/>
the lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like unschooling! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936379132">Hmmm. I&#39;m glad this was brought up, because it touches on something <br/>
I&#39;m struggling with in general.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to go to the pool this summer, but am nervous about trying <br/>
to watch a 3.5 y o and a 1.5 y o. I was thinking about starting <br/>
lessons for both of them soon, to get them and me used to the water <br/>
and so that my son could learn some safety rules when it&#39;s one on one <br/>
with either me or dh, not when it&#39;s me watching both kids.<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s a kiddie pool where we&#39;d spend most of our time, but <br/>
then Mikey would want to go off with the big kids (he has no clue the <br/>
9 year olds don&#39;t seem him as a peer!) right when Caroline had a <br/>
poopie diaper.<br/>
<br/>
BUT.<br/>
<br/>
I know that when I&#39;m this uptight and worried about a situation, I&#39;m <br/>
usually obsessing and that doesn&#39;t help Mikey learn anything. I know <br/>
that I&#39;m scared of new situations. I know that&#39;s not productive, but <br/>
it&#39;s hard to see a path that would work when you&#39;re really tense.<br/>
<br/>
Dh isn&#39;t interested in going to the pool, but I can &quot;make&quot; him go <br/>
with me the first couple times. Or I can go with a friend with an <br/>
older child...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one example of an issue I&#39;m struggling with. I&#39;ve been meaning <br/>
to post about when siblings start fighting. I get very upset at <br/>
seeing my son hit my daughter. We have great talks about being nice <br/>
to each other and he&#39;s a sweetie a lot of the time. The other times, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to avoid over-reacting without not reacting at all.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now that I seem completely off-balance, I&#39;ll mention that most <br/>
of the time I&#39;m pretty calm. Just not sure what to fill in instead of <br/>
lecturing in an annoyed or fearful tone.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both of my kids have had swimming lessons at various times. Neither <br/>
of them are taking swimming lessons now. DS (7.5) didn&#39;t even set a <br/>
foot in the water until almost 5. He has some pretty serious sensory <br/>
issues, so of course we didn&#39;t push that one. Once he did go in, he <br/>
was swimming within a year. He&#39;s a great natural swimmer, though we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have known it from his early reactions. DD (4.5)has been a <br/>
water hound since day 1 (well, both kids were water births, so really <br/>
since day 1!). We went to Hawaii when she was 4 months old and I took <br/>
her in the pool there. After that, all vacation long, whenever we <br/>
walked by the pool at the hotel she would screech and reach her arms <br/>
towards the water. That interest has never waned, she always wants to <br/>
go swimming. Interestingly, she&#39;s just now starting to swim without a <br/>
floatie - at about the same age that DS did (who rarely set foot in a <br/>
pool before that). So the amount of exposure to water didn&#39;t make <br/>
that big of a difference.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, I have read of studies where they showed that <br/>
the single biggest influence on whether a child became a great <br/>
swimmer when they were older was the amount of time that they <br/>
*played* in the water (especially deeper water like ponds or lakes, <br/>
where they had to tread water). Playing around in the water gives a <br/>
person a great feel for how to move water with their hands and feet - <br/>
something good swimmers just seem to know instinctively.<br/>
<br/>
As an a swim instructor and coach who teaches a class of adult <br/>
swimmers, I can tell you that most people do not learn how to swim <br/>
well from the swim lessons that they take as children. Most <br/>
techniques that swim instructors use on young children are incorrect <br/>
and will actually stand them poorly later on when they have to try <br/>
and change these bad habits (unfortunately, I&#39;m the one trying to <br/>
help them break these bad habits, and it&#39;s hard!!!). Most swim <br/>
teachers who teach kids swimming aren&#39;t excellent swimmers <br/>
themselves. Now personally, it would make little sense for me to hire <br/>
something like a violin teacher who didn&#39;t play well. But <br/>
surprisingly, many people do this for swimming. The swim teacher that <br/>
my kids had, they really liked. Also, I saw her swimming all the <br/>
time, even when she wasn&#39;t teaching (actually, she&#39;s the only one out <br/>
of all of the instructors where I work that I regularly see actually <br/>
swimming by herself). I thought she was a good match for both <br/>
reasons. At a certain point, each of the kids wanted to quit lessons, <br/>
so they did, but I do have a personal requirement that they learn <br/>
water safety - enough skills to keep themselves safe in the water - <br/>
for me, that stems from my experience as a lifeguard, having to, on a <br/>
couple of occasions, save children who didn&#39;t have good water safety <br/>
skills. They&#39;ve chosen to do that with me right now. That&#39;s been our <br/>
experience so far.<br/>

 Swimmies are dangerous.  They give kids a false sense of security,<br/>
parents too!  Kids who use them are most likely to drown, in my<br/>
opinion.  They do not understand how their body reacts with and floats<br/>
in water.  If they ever did fall in without their floaties they would be<br/>
unable to deal with the water, as they would feel different in the water<br/>
without the swimmies. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Swimmies may be dangerous if you don&#39;t watch your kids. Just like walkers<br/>
and all the horror stories about those. All 4 of my kids had walkers and<br/>
swimmies and all managed to get through those dangers just fine. We watch<br/>
our kids. For us and our kids, swimmies are not dangerous.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;As I signed 8-year-old DS up for swimming lessons today (he finally<br/>
&gt; asked for them)  it occurred to me to ask how others here may have<br/>
&gt; experienced<br/>
&gt; &quot;swimming&quot; in connection to unschooling, and since it&#39;s that time of year,<br/>
&gt; maybe it&#39;s on other minds besides mine? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My first daughter horsed around in the pool that was at my mom&#39;s complex.<br/>
&gt; She always had her little swimmies and gradually asked for them not to be<br/>
&gt; blown up all the way. When my husband and I took her to Daytona one year,<br/>
&gt; there she was, swimming in the pool at the hotel. Little head barely above<br/>
&gt; water but she was doing it. She was 5-6 at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With my younger kids, my SIL was always, every year, informing me about<br/>
&gt; swimming lessons at a local high school pool. From the time Joseph was<br/>
born,<br/>
&gt; she was telling me about the lessons. When the kids were old enough to<br/>
&gt; understand, I would ask them if they wanted to go. They never did. And<br/>
every<br/>
&gt; time I saw my SIL at my other SIL&#39;s house, where there was a pool and our<br/>
&gt; kids were in with their swimmies, she would tell me, AGAIN, about the<br/>
&gt; lessons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never learned to swim until I was 14. I had lessons. They terrified me<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; my mom pulled me out. I learned on my own when we got a pool. I saw Tara<br/>
&gt; learn on her own too. Never had any doubts the other 3 would do anything<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; learn when they wanted to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We moved into a larger house over 3 years ago. We have a pool. We have a<br/>
&gt; pool fence. Alyssa is 3 and doesn&#39;t know how to swim. She knows to stay<br/>
away<br/>
&gt; from the pool no matter what if her swimmies aren&#39;t on. She knows to stay<br/>
&gt; outside the fence if it&#39;s opened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first year we were here, the two middle kids learned to swim. We moved<br/>
&gt; here in Aug. and they were swimming on their own that same month. They are<br/>
&gt; fish now. They know water safety and what not to do and what to do if<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a problem. We talk about that here. We go over it frequently. I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; no doubt Alyssa will learn on her own just like the others did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917387837">Yes, but not everyone does watch their children, all the time.  I just <br/>
spent four hours at the pool, and I was the ONLY parent there who never <br/>
stopped watching the pool.  One parent came with a non-swimming 9ish <br/>
girl, and promptly went to sleep.  There was a party in the clubhouse <br/>
next to the pool, and I was the ONLY adult outside, all other adults <br/>
were inside the clubhouse.  There were probably 15 kids, ages 4-15 in <br/>
the pool from the party.  I was the one who rescued the 6ish child who <br/>
got out beyond his ability to walk and almost drowned, with his finger <br/>
tips 3 inches from being able to reach the side. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think that there are some parents, maybe even many parents, who <br/>
can use inherently dangerous devices like swimmies and walkers, and <br/>
their kids grow up fine.  But that does not negate the idea that <br/>
swimmies are dangerous.  All it takes is ten seconds next to water and a <br/>
child can drown.  A few years ago I rescued a four year old.  He was <br/>
wearing swimmies. He had spent an hour in the pool, while his mother <br/>
talked on the phone and read and slept next to the pool.  The child was <br/>
all over the pool, in the deep end, etc.  To him, HE COULD SWIM!  Cause, <br/>
in his swimmies, he could.   His mom was getting him ready to go,  had <br/>
taken off his swimmies, and turned around to gather their items.  Her <br/>
phone rang so she answered it.  In the mean time her child had jumped <br/>
back into the deep end.  He could swim well there a few minutes ago, why <br/>
not now?  I jumped in after him, dragged him from the bottom, and had <br/>
him out of the pool before his mom realized he was in the pool.  Sure, <br/>
she was,w ell, not attentive, but I don&#39;t watch my kids every second.  <br/>
Not all pools are safe.  Your child could be with a neighbor or a <br/>
friend&#39;s parent who doesn&#39;t watch as closely.  There are lots of ifs, <br/>
and children die every year because of pools and water. <br/>
<br/>
We had a walker too.  We watched our child in it, and we knew it was <br/>
dangerous, but we used it anyway.  We made a choice to do so.  If you <br/>
want to use swimmies, fine.  But, you should know, they are dangerous.  <br/>
They give the child a sense of power in the water they don&#39;t really have. <br/>
<br/>
Water is dangerous.  Swimmies add to that danger. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312608622">Jayn has been going into the pool with us since she was less than one. And<br/>
she has always loved the water. Before fully getting into unschooling, she<br/>
did take some lessons from a nice enough lady who came to our house. We had<br/>
come back from our 4 months in Texas, so it was when Jayn was 2.5. She had<br/>
been using a vest type floaty with front and back pockets containing sheets<br/>
of foam that you could sequentially remove as the child&#39;s proficiency<br/>
increased. I had gotten down to about half of them by the time Jayn<br/>
dispensed with this item entirely.<br/>
The teacher focused on getting Jayn to put her face under the water (to say<br/>
hello to the plastic toys) and to get her to float holding on to a broom<br/>
stick, without floaties. Jayn would decide when the lesson was over, and<br/>
quite liked Joy. I guess the main idea was about floating, but I didn&#39;t see<br/>
any &quot;progress&quot; towards swimming. Of course Jayn was so willing to get her<br/>
face wet, jump in, splash herself and whoever she was playing with, outside<br/>
of the lessons. I never really felt the lessons were much good, and I<br/>
watched every one from above expecting to gain some insight into how I could<br/>
help Jayn learn to swim enough to be safe if she fell in - didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
Constant vigilance is what we practice around our pool. <br/>
The following summer Jayn and our neighbors simply played in the pool. (Jayn<br/>
being 3.5) In the course of those few months all three kids went from<br/>
floaties to no floaties of any kind. I would ask Jayn if she wanted hers,<br/>
and usually she would start with her vest on, and then have me take it off.<br/>
Jonah, just a few months older than Jayn is a fantastic natural swimmer -<br/>
diving to the bottom of the deep end to retrieve tocks and toys. Renee is so<br/>
much taller (2 years older) that she was on her tip toes while Jayn and<br/>
Jonah were forced to dog paddle. They also did a lot of leaping into my arms<br/>
in the water. She could dogpaddle the length of the pool - 25 ft - and a few<br/>
strokes underwater.<br/>
I had to ask the neighbor&#39;s aunt to stop repeating to Jayn to keep her mouth<br/>
closed to not swallow water - not wanting Jayn&#39;s enjoyment destroyed just<br/>
because Aunt can&#39;t let go of trying to control her family. I also had to be<br/>
in the water with Jonah and Jayn, because sometimes he would get rough and<br/>
want to pull Jayn under - and she was sometimes scared of him. <br/>
She still swims and insists on going in the water even now before the heater<br/>
is turned on and it is very cold - and sometimes in her clothes. Any chance<br/>
she gets to swim she has grabbed and I feel it is all her own work.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s my mood, maybe it&#39;s the way you seem to come across. I have a<br/>
problem with you making a blatant statement about swimmies being dangerous.<br/>
You pointed how you feel you think they give the child a false sense of<br/>
security and also the parents. No facts really, just a feeling you have.<br/>
<br/>
I have known children personally who have drowned in back yard pools. More<br/>
than half of those children had swimming lessons and learned how to float if<br/>
they ever fell into a pool. I certainly wouldn&#39;t make a statement about<br/>
lessons being dangerous and giving a false sense of security to anyone. I<br/>
would state that no matter what the circumstances were, children should be<br/>
watched by a pool or any kind of water.<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids ever thought they could swim just because they had their<br/>
swimmies on. None of my kids were ever not watched because they had their<br/>
swimmies on. Yes some parents don&#39;t watch their kids. I do.<br/>
<br/>
And just for the record, I never thought walkers were *dangerous* either.<br/>

<br/>
Swimmies are likewise.  The points about their danger are valid.  <br/>
However, in the Skowhegan, ME area where I used to live, a family <br/>
went swimming in the river, and all drowned in the current except <br/>
the littlest one who was wearing swimmies and was found at the bank <br/>
downriver two hours later.  Not that one story implies they are <br/>
safe, either, but that nothing is absolute.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of things can be dangerous.  Water is dangerous to children <br/>
whether they wear swimmies or not -- the question is water <br/>
education.  A kid who has never been in water or has only dealt in <br/>
kiddie pools and bathtubs will have no more respect for deep water <br/>
than a kid who&#39;s been in swimmies from birth -- unless they&#39;ve <br/>
learned about water and its potential danger.  OTOH, a child who&#39;s <br/>
wears swimmies can likewise still have an understanding of water <br/>
safety.  <br/>

I just found a bunch of links from very reputable sources indicating <br/>
swimmies are dangerous.  You disagree.  I challenge you to find any <br/>
statistics or reputable sources  that say floaties or swimmies are safe <br/>
or good for kids.  Besides, of course, the manufacturer of those items. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have known children personally who have drowned in back yard pools. More<br/>
&gt; than half of those children had swimming lessons and learned how to <br/>
&gt; float if<br/>
&gt; they ever fell into a pool. I certainly wouldn&#39;t make a statement about<br/>
&gt; lessons being dangerous and giving a false sense of security to anyone. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I would make that statement.  I think that swim lessons do <br/>
make some kids feel more confident than they truly are, and that can <br/>
cause them to get into a situation where drowning could happen.  The <br/>
only thing that can prevent drowning is parent watching, and even then <br/>
that doesn&#39;t always work.  I&#39;ll never forget the story of the little <br/>
girl who drowned a few years ago in the hot tub, with her mom right <br/>
there.  The mom had some sort of seizure or something, and blacked out.  <br/>
Baby died. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; would state that no matter what the circumstances were, children should be<br/>
&gt; watched by a pool or any kind of water.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is exactly my point.  I have no doubt that Krusula is absolutely <br/>
watching her children all the time, and that their pool is as safe is <br/>
possible, but accidents happen.  And parents who rely upon swimmies to <br/>
help their children learn to swim are doing a great disservice to their <br/>
children.  Water is dangerous, no child is water safe, no adult is water <br/>
safe.  Lessons are not a guarantee that children will not drown.  Even <br/>
parents watching is not a guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; None of my kids ever thought they could swim just because they had their<br/>
&gt; swimmies on. None of my kids were ever not watched because they had their<br/>
&gt; swimmies on. Yes some parents don&#39;t watch their kids. I do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that thousands and thousands of children each day wear swimmies <br/>
and few die.  But that does not negate their danger.<br/>

================<br/>
<br/>
Holly, the second best swimmer here (next to her dad) used to have various <br/>
kinds of flotation toys  She knew the difference between playing and swimming  <br/>
She wasn&#39;t hurt  She wasn&#39;t misled or overconfident.  She was never alone.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t find statistics or reputable sources that say unschooling is good <br/>
for kids.  All we have are personal testimonials and a few kids who are doing <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
I bet there are more kids who have used floaties safely than there are who <br/>
have unschooled throughout all their school years with success.<br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>

So unless what&#39;s being posted leads toward more trust and support of kids, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125148422">I am thinking about signing seamus up for &quot;swim lessons&quot; just to give <br/>
him something to do with other kids. It never occurred to me to do so <br/>
for safety&#39;s sake. He loves loves loves water, and to swim. I don&#39;t <br/>
even know if he CAN swim, but he hasnt drowned yet. I think swimming <br/>
is on his list of most favorite things in the world. The apt we just <br/>
moved to has a pool, my sisters apt has a pool, my other brothers apt <br/>
has a pool, and there is a community pool. But where he developed his <br/>
love for swimming is at hotels. His paternal grandmother is a <br/>
historian and travels everywhere and seamus goes with her alot(either <br/>
with his dad or myself.) Everywhere he has every stayed (with the <br/>
exception of London)he has been in a hotel with a pool. <br/>
<br/>
We tried water wings (referred to on the list as swimmies i guess? or <br/>
is that something different?)once, and they were really <br/>
uncomfortable, and affected his balance in a weird way. So when he <br/>
was little he would just hang onto me or his dad. And when he was oh <br/>
probably four or so we got one of those floating kick boards and that <br/>
was great because he could go the length of the pool but also let go <br/>
if he wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
At the amusement park in cincy there is a huge &quot;wave pool&quot;, i went <br/>
with a close friend, her baby, her son who is a year younger than <br/>
seamus, and seamus. While her son was still trying to get past the <br/>
first wave (he was scared), i couldnt even *find* seamus. Finally <br/>
noticed him waaaaay off near the deeper end. It was a little scary to <br/>
have lost him(helps that he has flaming red hair), but he was totally <br/>
fine doing somersaults in the water. <br/>
<br/>
There is also a swim club here, and i think that might be more along <br/>
the lines of what he would want rather than &quot;lessons&quot;, i think i&#39;ll <br/>
check that out too. <br/>
<br/>
I think much of the skills seamus has learned, he has learned by <br/>
&quot;doing.&quot; He was never taught how to ride a bike, he basically jumped <br/>
on and there he went. Other kids might be more comfortable with <br/>
lessons, if they don&#39;t naturally take to water. <br/>

Yes, but not everyone does watch their children, all the time.  I just <br/>
spent four hours at the pool, and I was the ONLY parent there who never <br/>
stopped watching the pool. <br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
So the danger with walkers or stairs or busy streets or crackers is mostly <br/>
children being unattended, right?<br/>
<br/>
Given a worst-case scenario and someone needing to blame someone ELSE instead <br/>
of taking responsibility for their own parenting, it&#39;s dangerous for a <br/>
company to manufacture or sell or allow walkers or floaties.  That&#39;s about business <br/>
and money.  When someone wants to sue someone they &quot;prove&quot; in statistical ways <br/>
that the product is dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
-=- All it takes is ten seconds next to water and a <br/>
child can drown. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It takes less than that if they&#39;re UNDER the water, and way more than that if <br/>
they&#39;re not in the water at all.<br/>
Where does the ten seconds come from?<br/>
<br/>
How long does it take in seconds for a kid standing near a street to be hit <br/>
by a car?  It&#39;s not standing NEXT to the street, it&#39;s stepping in front of a <br/>
car.  A child who&#39;s careful who is with a parent who is careful is safer than <br/>
those who are alone or whose parents are asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The question, though, was whether swimming lessons were problematical in <br/>
terms of unschooling, I think.<br/>

floaties AND sometimes a swimsuit that inflated around the middle. <br/>
Wearing floaties made it far more fun for them. It didn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t <br/>
right there watching them, that would just be dumb to depend on <br/>
floaties to keep them safe. It just made it possible for them to do <br/>
much more - to play a lot more fun games - in the pool.<br/>
<br/>
As they kids learned to swim, they still put the floaties on most of <br/>
the time, but eventually they weren&#39;t even inflated and the kids pretty <br/>
soon just stopped bothering with them. It was their decision - they&#39;d <br/>
ask me to blow them up for them and what happened was that over time <br/>
they stopped asking to have them inflated and then just gradually <br/>
stopped using them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642350590">You know, I forgot to mention that we do a lot of hotel pool swimming, and I <br/>
don&#39;t just rely on the swim lessons (which I sit on the sidelines and <br/>
observe), I also help him with different things when we swim together. My dad actually <br/>
was instrumental in getting him to enjoy getting his face wet. He had Wyl put <br/>
his arms around his neck, hangning down Grandad&#39;s back, told him what he was <br/>
going to do, had Wyl hold his breath, and then dove underwater with Wyl <br/>
piggy-backing along for the short, shallow dive (my dad is a fish, by the way! LOL) <br/>
Now, that is his favorite game! He also loves to push off from the edge toward <br/>
one of us (me, Daddy, Grandma or Grandaddy) and splash, flop, bounce, hop (he <br/>
thinks he&#39;s swimming) to us or from us to the edge of the pool. It helps him <br/>
with his &quot;learning not to panic&quot; and how to adjust when the distance was <br/>
farther than he thought. I&#39;m not a good swimmer (but an excellent floater! LOL) and <br/>
thought that swim lessons might help him to learn the basics. He is a &quot;no <br/>
fear&quot; kind of child, and no matter how many times he got out a bit too deep in <br/>
the pool and scared himself before I helped him to the shallower water, he still <br/>
has not enough fear of the deep water to keep an eye on where it is or to <br/>
stay out of it-but he loves to be in the water. Hence the lessons. :~)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll bite. <br/>
<br/>
I think they *can* be. Depends on the instructor, the other kids, and the <br/>
child in question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d shy away from an instructor who inadvertently (or advertently!) makes a <br/>
child fearful of the water. Other kids who are already fearful and would scare <br/>
my child. I&#39;d take my child into consideration (duh!) and whether he&#39;d get <br/>
anything out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Duncan last year whether he&#39;d like to take swim lessons with his <br/>
friend, Clayton. He had been a guest one morning when Clayton had a lesson. Duncan <br/>
said no because he already knew how to do everything they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
I already avoid freaky parents on the side who are constantly telling their <br/>
kids what to do and trying to get them to put their faces in the water or keep <br/>
them out of the deep end or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys learned (Duncan with swimmies; Cameron, without----just what <br/>
they preferred) just by being in the water a LOT. Neither has a gorgeous breast <br/>
stroke, but neither do I, after 7-8 years of childhood swim lessons.<br/>
<br/>
And THAT&#39;s a strange phenomenon! Every year, I&#39;d have to &quot;relearn&quot; how to <br/>
swim! That&#39;s why we had lessons every year----so my mother said. To &quot;relearn&quot; how <br/>
to swim. Neither of my boys &quot;forgot&quot; how to swim over the winter! Maybe I <br/>
just didn&#39;t *learn* it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say that it&#39;s just like everything else----it depends. But a bad <br/>
instructor could do more damage than no lessons at all. <br/>

the steps. Does that mean walking is dangerous?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the problem is that *swimmies* can make kids overconfident in<br/>
their abilities in the water. Overconfidence can come from many sources<br/>
besides swimmies like personality or peers.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that swimmies can make *parents* overconfident about<br/>
children&#39;s abilities in the water and the parents are not as attentive as<br/>
they still need to be.<br/>
<br/>
Information is better than fear. &quot;Swimmies are dangerous&quot; is fear. Swimmies<br/>
can make it look like kids can swim better than they can is good<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is looking at swimming as a good time for a relaxing break, then<br/>
they need to find other times to take the break they need since water time<br/>
is time for *more* attention.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joylyn, I have to respectfully disagree with you on this one. I think <br/>
(as with so many things) it depends on the child. Some kids never <br/>
have any kind of safe attitude towards water, and swimmies can make <br/>
it safer for these kinds of kids. My daughter as a toddler would go <br/>
over to the deep end and just throw herself in (this was before she <br/>
ever had any kind of floatie device). Just because she sank to the <br/>
bottom and we had to plunge in and pull her out *every* time did not <br/>
deter her at all! Getting a floatie for her to wear was great. We <br/>
still watched her, of course, but now we had at least some time to <br/>
get to her before she was on the bottom of the pool.<br/>
<br/>
That little boy that you saved might not have jumped into the deep <br/>
end *because* he thought he could swim, based on the fact that he was <br/>
wearing a floatie device. Maybe he was just the kind of kid that <br/>
habitually threw himself in the deep end and that&#39;s the reason his <br/>
mom had him in a floatie. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to say.<br/>
<br/>
I think floaties are a tool. They can really help in some situations, <br/>
they can hinder in others. Just like a spatula can be used to flip <br/>
eggs or whack someone over the head. For our son, he was always so <br/>
cautious around the water, he never wore a floatie. Then when he <br/>
wanted to try to swim but was very scared of not being able to touch <br/>
the bottom, a floatie gave him more confidence to try the water out. <br/>
He wore it for a matter of months, then could swim. For our daughter <br/>
the daredevil, we&#39;ve had a floatie on her since she could toddle (and <br/>
hurl herself into the deep end time after time). Now she&#39;s taking it <br/>
off for periods of time and swimming without it. I think it&#39;s been a <br/>
safe thing in her case, it wasn&#39;t necessary in my son&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
One other anecdote - I was at a lake with friends 2 years ago and <br/>
their toddler ran straight into the water. There was a big drop-off <br/>
and she started going down. Luckily, one of the moms dashed into the <br/>
water and caught her. Again, another child (like mine!) who seemed to <br/>
know no fear around water. She tried to do it again later. The mom <br/>
ended up putting her in a floatie the rest of the summer when we were <br/>
at the lake. If nothing else, when she ran into the water, she&#39;d <br/>
float long enough for someone to get to her, instead of sinking into <br/>
the murk. I know for a fact that in her situation a floatie was the <br/>
farthest thing from dangerous. I think it really depends on how <br/>
they&#39;re used. The best safety device is a parent who pays attention <br/>
to their child!</div>
