Yes, I see you point.  My dd would like some outside activities but we are limited due to the location of where we live.  So I was wondering that by having her more isolated than she would like, how can we overcome that?  Or can we? Do some of you live or have moved just to be near available lessons, groups, activities for your kids?  Are some of you or your children more outgoing but also limited by where you live or perhaps finances?<br/>
We do lots of things in the home...computers, video games, DVDs, crafts, reading, piano, guitar, board games, etc., etc. but of course, this mainly involves mom and kids.   Just wishing that I could give her a little more outside activities...<br/>

  cruel. But it would be cruel to treat a child who loved outside activities<br/>
  like my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
  The question isn&#39;t what do kids need but what do *your* kids need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039643370">Hi Lisa<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in just exactly the situation you describe: live in the <br/>
country, not involved in the public school and not involved in the <br/>
religious life of our neighborhood...we are isolated. This hasn&#39;t <br/>
been a problem, as our kids have had chickens and a treehouse, and <br/>
I&#39;ve always had plenty of books, craft books and supplies; we have <br/>
bikes, good places to walk (one of my passions is Amateur Naturalist-<br/>
ing...LOL)...so our outside activities have centered around stuff we <br/>
can do as a family right here in our valley...and then my oldest <br/>
became a teenager, and has been more involved in the nearest city for <br/>
three years, as a library volunteer. This has meant at times, twice a <br/>
week drives to the city... hour long drives that put 100 mi round <br/>
trip on our vehicles. When she signed up for a drama workshop at <br/>
Idaho State, it was an EVERY DAY drive, for five days in a row. She <br/>
is also in the drama class at a high school that is 30 minutes <br/>
distant...every day, mon-fri, 60 miles on the van! ack...<br/>
<br/>
And so, partly because of the activity level that she is choosing, <br/>
and partly because our two younger ones are beginning to come into <br/>
that age (at 9 and nearly 11...) but mostly because we need to be <br/>
near an economic center for the jobs available...we are moving closer <br/>
to a large city, just so that we do have activities closer by.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that never did catch our attention, but is lots of fun for <br/>
many families (and has POTENTIAL!!!) is 4-H...are you in an area <br/>
where you can get involved in 4-H? I have a friend whose boy has been <br/>
all over the nation, including to DC more than once, due to his 4-H <br/>
involvement, and is now attending college in Pharmacology on a full <br/>
ride academic scholarship...homeschooled his whole life, with 4-H <br/>
being the one consistent factor in his and his sisters&#39; educations...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, if you are in the middle of nowhere, sounds like the country, <br/>
or small town...4-H would be my biggest recommendation, if it&#39;s <br/>
something your family likes. <br/>
<br/>
We drove many miles getting our older girl to her activities, and now <br/>
we are moving closer to those activities...but 4-H IS activities. We <br/>
just never did get into it. And we have to move anyway, but we might <br/>
have moved for the sake of closer activities...I&#39;m looking forward to <br/>
it big time.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC<br/>
