<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020257546">Partly in way of explanation, and partly as a separate issue, I wanted to <br/>
pursue my objection to the use of the word &quot;ridiculous.&quot;    I categorize it with <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s stupid,&quot; as a phrase that separates people from thought or possible <br/>
acceptance of or exposure to something.<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst blocks to unschooling I&#39;ve ever seen is negativity, and <br/>
often it&#39;s in the form of the mom having a category of things she declared to be <br/>
&quot;stupid.&quot;    It might be a genre of music or a type of movie.   It might be a <br/>
subgroup of people. It might be television or video games.   But voicing <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s stupid&quot; chops off part of the world, walls it off,   makes it unavailable.   <br/>
It causes children to choose to agree with the mom&#39;s (literal word use) <br/>
prejudice, or to reject the mom to some degree in order to even LOOK at or listen <br/>
to or talk to the &quot;Stupid&quot; things or people.<br/>
<br/>
I think the use of &quot;ridiculuous&quot; does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m touchy about its use on this list because a few years back I was called <br/>
ridiculous, and some of the unschooling ideas I had lived with and lived by for <br/>
a decade were declared &quot;ridiculous.&quot;   It&#39;s not a good word.   It&#39;s not a <br/>
good category to put things, people, information, books, or ideas in.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom states WHY she thinks the people at the skating rink might be better <br/>
to hang around with than the druggies behind the pool hall, then she&#39;s giving <br/>
information and operating on principle and helping her son or daughter <br/>
develop ways to consider in the future how to decide who to hang out with and why.   <br/>
But if she says &quot;Skaters are good people, but pool players are stupid,&quot; she&#39;s <br/>
moved into the realm of prejudice and fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
Stating the advantages or pitfalls of a practice or a book or an idea can <br/>
lead to thought and discussion, where condemnation of it with &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;ridicul<br/>
ous&quot; can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Over many years I&#39;ve tried to nudge people away from their depressive <br/>
negative declarations and toward lighter, more hopeful stances and attitudes for the <br/>
sake of opening the world up to them as a place to make increasingly easy and <br/>
effortless connections.   A mom&#39;s confidence and attitude make or break <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe&quot; is better than &quot;doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Might&quot; is better than &quot;won&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Incrementally, people who are used to negativity can move toward more <br/>
acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not my favorite&quot; is better than &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Unnecessary&quot; is better than &quot;ridiculous.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
Giving information and letting other people draw their own conclusions <br/>
from the information is more helpful and, um, educational than just <br/>
handing down the judgement.  (for instance, &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;silly&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we disapprove of something it takes time and analysis to <br/>
dredge up our reasons and consider them.  But it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we disapprove of part of something, it&#39;s easy to slip <br/>
into condemning it completely and not seeing its virtues.<br/>
