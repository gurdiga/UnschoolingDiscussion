<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952879522">I wrote<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t even know if I get what mathematics is, --a language, a philosphy, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; human endeavour, just like music, a tool--???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and Sandra replied<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Music&#39;s a tool?<br/>
&gt; (I know; in some ways it serves as one.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, when I read your response, I realized that I hadn&#39;t been clear in my post (well, I<br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;realize&quot; that, I knew it all along).  I was listing the ways I&#39;ve heard math described<br/>
rather than saying that &quot;music is a tool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
However, this has brought me a little closer to what I&#39;m wondering.  Come to think of it, I DO<br/>
believe that music is a &quot;tool&quot; for some people; that it helps them to unlock some mysteries of<br/>
the universe and understand it a bit better.  And this leads me to the next part of what I&#39;m<br/>
wondering<br/>
<br/>
Betsy wrote<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you recommend some enticing math books for an adult dabbler?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and Sandra, you replied<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that generally buying &quot;a math book&quot; only reinforces the idea that<br/>
&gt; math isn&#39;t a full infusion of the whole universe, but that it exists in<br/>
&gt; frightening math books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I appreciated that reply and the suggestions you made.  We do have many of these things (and in<br/>
the Connections line, have another book called The Pinball Effect, shelved with history).  I&#39;m<br/>
aware, as is my math squirrel, of the dangers lurking in frightening math books, but I&#39;m willing<br/>
to take a chance.  Our library has wild and broadly overlapping sections on history, geography,<br/>
religion, education, science, cooking, philosophy, literature, biography, and a bunch of other<br/>
&quot;topics&quot;.  In spite of the overlaps, it helps us to locate things.In the section we could call<br/>
math are only a couple of  &quot;fun with math&quot; type things that I bought when I was supply teaching,<br/>
and a textbook or two.<br/>
<br/>
I can see the math in this and that; I even see that it IS a full infusion of the whole<br/>
universe, but are there any writers who are able to let me in on their sense of wonder, on their<br/>
AHA&#39;s and on what grips them in mathematics?<br/>
<br/>
Let me try it this way,--I am touched emotionally, sometimes moved to tears by music, poetry,<br/>
prose, paintings, photographs, films, dance, plays and people&#39;s actions.  I&#39;ve not yet been<br/>
touched by anything that I recognize as mathematical, but I believe it to be possible.  Are<br/>
there people who experience the world through mathematics and can communicate the passionate,<br/>
the beautiful or the emotional part of it?  My husband suggests that math doesn&#39;t work this way,<br/>
precisely.  He suggests that music and architecture ARE  mathematical expressions of the beauty<br/>
and wonder of the universe, that it is, in itself, divorced from emotion and all that (I may not<br/>
have that last part quite right).<br/>
<br/>
Cindy, you wrote<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure what to recommend.  I find a lot of it fascinating but I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; also a mathematician!  I learned early in my life that I thought differently<br/>
&gt; about math than those around me - I liked it!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to have a window on your experience of math.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You could start with the history of mathematics - how it got started, how<br/>
&gt; it developed, etc.  Check out Marvin Gardner&#39;s books - he writes (or wrote)<br/>
&gt; a column in Scientific American about mathematical games.  In fact any<br/>
&gt; mathematical game book might be a good starting point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The development from philosphy I know and have read a little about.  I&#39;ll do some more and I&#39;ll<br/>
check out Marvin Gardner.  Mathematical games and game theory stuff may not be a way in for me<br/>
(math squirrel is scratching away), but perhaps for the others living here.  I&#39;ll try this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also what interests do you and your family have?  Carpentry and quilting<br/>
&gt; both involve geometry for example!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interests?  We all enjoy reading and going to second hand bookstores or library book sales.  Les<br/>
is an actor, as was I before getting the papers to teach drama and English, so interpretting<br/>
written language and making it come alive are  kind of an all-encompassing way of life around<br/>
here.  But this is not exactly an interest, more something we try to keep under control.<br/>
<br/>
For me, trying to figure out why people do what they do and trying to understand the world from<br/>
different people&#39;s perspectives (hence this current curiousity about making a little excursion<br/>
into mathematicians&#39; minds). I do what comes along and am interested in most of it for a time.<br/>
Basic carpentry if there&#39;s something that needs to be built, or electricity if something  it<br/>
needs rewiring, knitting a pair of socks, or sewing something, but these are not really<br/>
interests. When not working, Les reads mostly history, philosphy and literature (bridge and<br/>
chess books to relax when working on a show). They do airplane models together and talk about<br/>
the history of aviation, both in itself and as it relates to various wars and such. Ned is<br/>
interested in streetcars, airships, computer games, urban planning, transportation in general,<br/>
model trains, board games.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of math here, I think, but tool math, not gorgeous math or inspirational math  or math as<br/>
the key to the universe.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s thoughts made some connections for me, too.  I&#39;m going back to mulling this over, and<br/>
watching where this thread goes, but if anyone thinks of any books that might help me to flip<br/>
the switch, let me know.  Thanks for the ideas.<br/>

it. But it is not &quot;emotionally moving&quot; the way I get moved by poetry or a <br/>
painting or dance or theater. It is different but no less amazingly wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
It is excitement, thrill, sense of completion, sense of &quot;rightness&quot; or of <br/>
being &quot;in tune&quot; (there&#39;s that music analogy again) with the universe -- it is <br/>
the &quot;brain&quot; having an AHA moment, not the heart. It is a little or big burst <br/>
of understanding about how things work in our world and having either a <br/>
flashing moment or a slow dawning of understanding about how the universe <br/>
works in patterns that repeat and make sense at many many different levels. <br/>
This is the level at which it feels spiritual to me. It is that level of <br/>
&quot;connectedness&quot; and patterns and things working in a way that makes some kind <br/>
of ultimate sense and that it is something we can strive to understand while <br/>
knowing we can never fully understand. This is somehow related (and I&#39;m sorry <br/>
that I can&#39;t express this more articulately) to my own belief that our <br/>
purpose in this life is to strive to know God - who is unknowable (and who is <br/>
not limited to the simple anthropomorphic concept of a deity that most <br/>
religions teach). So - striving to comprehend something that uncovers or <br/>
opens my eyes to patterns in the universe seems part of that spiritual <br/>
purpose.  But - so is EVERYTHING else that involves learning; all things that <br/>
give us glimpses into human nature or into the nature of the universe. I <br/>
believe that we&#39;re hardwired with in inherent inner need to learn things to <br/>
get those peak moment flashes or slow dawnings of understanding and that is <br/>
why unschooling &quot;works.&quot; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not good at math, and I&#39;m an atheist.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmmmm.....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Same here.  I have a friend who finally *got* math as an adult about<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same time she found God.<br/>
