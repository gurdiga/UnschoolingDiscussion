&gt; This is one of my pet-project ideas, that I&#39;d love to be doing right<br/>
&gt; now but dh wouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;d like to be a foster-parent to teenage girls<br/>
&gt; who are pregnant and have no family support.  I know it sounds big-<br/>
&gt; headed, but I think I could be a positive role-model for their<br/>
&gt; mothering skills, and a good sounding-board for them and their<br/>
&gt; lives.  I&#39;m not that far removed from their age and I was almost a<br/>
&gt; teenage mother myself, so I think I have a lot to give to people in<br/>
&gt; such a situation.  But what I want to do and what works for our<br/>
&gt; family are 2 different things :-(<br/>

I don&#39;t know about England anymore Tracy, but the problem in America seems to <br/>
be getting worse with teenage mothers rather than better.  And now they are <br/>
flushing them down the toilet to get rid of them.... What will they think of <br/>
next (sorry to sound cynical, but I get hardened by all the stories I read <br/>
about teenage girls today)....  I wonder if these girls are being parented or <br/>
just left to cope after school on their own, or is it school that has the <br/>
biggest influence on them getting pregnant in the first place???  All lofty <br/>
questions to think about on a muggy afternoon in Tucson, or England (LOL)<br/>

&gt; The problem with this idea is that I have walked in these shoes, <br/>
&gt; and by the time I have the &#39;space&#39; in my life a) hubby still won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to do it and b) I won&#39;t be &#39;relevant&#39; to such people.  I&#39;ll be a <br/>
&gt; patronising, interfering old bat, rather than a fellow mother.  So if <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to do it, it does need to be now.  What I could do later <br/>
&gt; would be to encourage others to do this...  I hope it&#39;s not as big a <br/>
&gt; problem when I&#39;m older, though it&#39;s perhaps vain hope...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703296795">Efforts are being made to approach the problem, mostly by <br/>
studying other countries with lower teenage birth rates.  <br/>
Personally, I have NO problem with teenager having babies, with <br/>
support and maturity stemming from responsibility for self, which <br/>
the modern (since Victorian/Edwardian times) emphasis on <br/>
&#39;childhood&#39; has largely removed.  School, and that reliance on <br/>
external stuff for conscience etc brought by rewards and <br/>
punishments that we were talking about, along with less well <br/>
attached children, for whatever reason (and there are VERY <br/>
many that I can think of) makes a combination where those who <br/>
feel the need for unconditional love and security seek it out by <br/>
getting pregnant. From what I&#39;ve seen, the projects in place to <br/>
&#39;combat&#39; teenage pregnancy seem to concentrate on social lessons <br/>
for teenagers, health education, etc.  The more sexually aware <br/>
cultures of Europe tend to have lower teenage birthrates.  BUT <br/>
many of those cultures don&#39;t start academic school until much <br/>
later than Britain (and that is getting earlier and earlier, we now <br/>
have targets for 3-5yo&#39;s and younger, even, sheesh!!) now is that <br/>
a coincedence?  Hmmm.  And many of those cultures have <br/>
higher breastfeeding rates and less separation from babies in <br/>
hospitals... oh, I feel a &#39;strongly felt discussion&#39; coming on... &lt;big <br/>

I think the problem I have with it, is that the majority of them are (a) not <br/>
married (b) not in comitted relationships (c) the relationships come to an <br/>

father).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;PS, that was an English girl who did that recently, wasn&#39;t it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it&#39;s going on there as well... but actually it was a story I was <br/>
reading about here in the US.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I can only talk about myself and how I was at 16 and there was no way <br/>
I could have given a baby the attention it needs.  I was into going out and <br/>
having a good time and travelling all over the world.  A baby would have been <br/>
like a ball and chain around my ankle at that point in my life.  I was at <br/>
school (in England) with several girls that got pregnant and had the babies <br/>
and at my high school reunion 2 years ago (yes I did fly all the way back <br/>
there) none of the fathers were still involved with those kids and most of <br/>
the women had re-married (if they married in the first place).  When talking <br/>
to two of them, they told me, even though they loved their kids (their kids <br/>
were 23) they wouldn&#39;t have done it that way again, but would have waited <br/>
until they were older and they were more mature.  I&#39;m sure there are mature <br/>
teenagers out there, just like there are immature people over the age of 30, <br/>
but from the teenagers I&#39;ve met they are far and few between.<br/>
<br/>
PS  This 2nd part is only in big letters because I copied Tracy&#39;s writing and <br/>
there is no more emphasis on this part than the first part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40221022">Well, quite.  I did want a family at that age.  But not without the <br/>
support of the father, so I wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s the whole responsibility <br/>
thing that&#39;s the issue for me.  Another problem for me (which is <br/>
something I&#39;d want to address as a &#39;big sister&#39; or whatever) is the <br/>
attitude given by the supporting agencies, that it&#39;s of utmost <br/>
importance for these mothers to learn more and go out to work, so <br/>
that there are now schools (or school departments) for pregnant <br/>
teenagers and teenage mothers, complete with creches.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to kick off the whole daycare thing again, but the state is <br/>
doing it&#39;s best to separate these mothers from their kids without <br/>
actually taking them away, and convincing the mothers that it&#39;s the <br/>
absolute best thing.  That&#39;s what gets up my nose.  I don&#39;t mean <br/>
that it&#39;s not important for these mothers to support themselves, I <br/>
mean that, as we have discussed, that it&#39;s possible without <br/>
separating them from their babies.  They could even have their <br/>
classes with babies in slings, for goodness sake!<br/>
<br/>
The story I read was a British girl at Boston airport who was on <br/>
her way back to Blighty to the boyfriend, father of the child, who <br/>
didn&#39;t know she was pregnant.  V sad.<br/>

&gt; Personally, I have NO problem with teenager having babies, with<br/>
&gt; support and maturity stemming from responsibility for self, which<br/>
&gt; the modern (since Victorian/Edwardian times) emphasis on<br/>
&gt; &#39;childhood&#39; has largely removed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kind of a half-truth here.  Prior to the Regency (50 years before Victoria)<br/>
and the rise of industrialism, it is true that teenagers were expected to<br/>
have babies, and expected to have more responsibility. BUT, it was also<br/>
assumed that people would live in extended family groupings, with family<br/>
members all around them, and that grandparents (specifically, the maternal<br/>
grandmother) would take a major role in teaching a mother how to care for<br/>
and raise a child, and, in fact, would take much of the responsibility on<br/>
herself.  The idea of doting, distant grandparents is a creation of the same<br/>
modern industrial system that produced public education -- nuclear families<br/>
were created by an industrial system which needed a mother at whom to raise<br/>
the new labor force, while men were slaving away in factories, far away from<br/>
their &quot;natural&quot; base of support in agrarian communities.<br/>
<br/>
So it might be said that earlier societies also had an extended &quot;childhood&quot;<br/>
-- it just included raising children!  And grandparents didn&#39;t get off so<br/>
easy....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88786431">Actually, a way to think of it is as a trade off between &quot;community and<br/>
belonging&quot; and &quot;opportunity&quot;.  Earlier societies (especially for women, but<br/>
before the 18th century for men, too) may have had lots of the first and<br/>
none of the 2nd.  Contemporary society bends (or at least it does<br/>
ideologically) toward the latter.  Striking a balance is HARD (which we all<br/>
know in our daily lives.)<br/>

I am almost 40 and alot of those dreams I have forgotten or just aren&#39;t <br/>

come and help clean up ducks. I really wanted to go and help, but I didn&#39;t. <br/>
I wanted to go to a raptor rehab facility and appentice, too. Didn&#39;t do that <br/>
either. Now I really regret those missed opportunities, and I think that if <br/>
I had taken more time for my own dreams all these years I would be a better <br/>
person, a better mother, and a better teacher for my kids now.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you Cathie for your honesty... I came to motherhood late in &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
terms I was 36 and 40.  However prior to have my kids, I worked on a cruise <br/>
ship around the Mediterranean, Sang in a band, worked in London, when I lived <br/>
65 miles away (not a big deal to the Americans) but I had to take a trian up <br/>
to London every day while friends were working in my local village... I had <br/>
about 60 jobs since I was 16 years old (age we leave school) and quit each <br/>
and every one of them to do what I wanted to do, which was travel and <br/>
experience the world... <br/>
<br/>
Now that I have my own business and run it around my family, I sometimes find <br/>
myself doing the same thing and saying &quot;when the kids get older&quot;... It&#39;s <br/>
amazing that I find time to do things I don&#39;t really want to do such as <br/>
grocery shopping, cleaning, etc and yet if I left it to hubbie, who would <br/>
happily do it I would have the time to spend at the Women&#39;s Crisis Center <br/>
(women that have been beaten and raped)... thanks for the wake up call and <br/>
reminding me that not everything in life has to be either tied to my business <br/>
or my kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cathie, when I was sixteen and my life was a small mess, no self esteem<br/>
to talk about, I faced a pyschological crisis in my life. I vowed then to<br/>
live a life of &#39;no regrets&#39;. My every moment was harrowed by guilt and<br/>
shame. I felt guilty for being alive. Everything that happened in a day was<br/>
&#39;my fault&#39; in my mind whether I had anything to do with it or not. Saying<br/>
&#39;no regrets&#39; for every moment of my life - that is everything that ever<br/>
happens to me is a good and positive thing, no matter what direction or<br/>
what consequence, it is for my greater good and I WILL see the learning in<br/>
every moment by becoming as aware as possible and looking for the positive,<br/>
was the first step in the road to recovery of self esteem for me. Twenty<br/>
years later I had a breakdown that finally allowed me to let go of the<br/>
remnant guilt attached to such a damaged childhood.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things in life that don&#39;t happen the way I want them to<br/>
right now. But I learn to see that what is happening right now has very<br/>
valuable lessons for me... lessons that my conscious mind might not bring<br/>
my way. I value what does come my way... I live for each and every moment,<br/>
not future or past moments. <br/>
<br/>
Living without &#39;regrets&#39; is incredibly empowering and makes my life so much<br/>
more satisfying. It is, above all else, just an attitude. <br/>
<br/>
It also frees me up from the baggage my parents would place on me, with<br/>
comments like &quot;you could have been successful&quot; - I AM successful, I am a<br/>
wonderful parent, a dedicated homeschooling pioneer and networker, a<br/>
permaculturalist, tread lightly on the earth, good financial manager, home<br/>
builder.... I just don&#39;t live like they do, and I don&#39;t have any regrets in<br/>
life!<br/>
<br/>
When I was ten I dreamed of writing novels. When I was twenty I knew that I<br/>
would be &#39;mature&#39; enough to do this at forty.... When I was seventeen I<br/>
told my lover that we would know what love is, really is, when we were<br/>
sixty... I am a patient person and know that time enriches my life, not<br/>
detracts from it. Every moment is a learning lesson for me, and I count my<br/>
blessings! <br/>
<br/>
I am writing novels now, I am self publishing homeschooling books, I play<br/>
with a &#39;business&#39;... I prioritise my time carefully so that I can do what I<br/>
need and want to do in all areas of my life. If I feel strongly about an<br/>
issue I attend to it. I don&#39;t sacrifice anything in my life for my family<br/>
or homeschooling... <br/>
<br/>
The thing that has astounded me about all of this is how it has affected<br/>
the children&#39;s personal development - and often how they have shown me the<br/>
way to stay true to my &#39;no regrets&#39; policy in life. I think it is all about<br/>
honouring oneself and having realistic expectations of one&#39;s abilities,<br/>
limitations, and knowing one&#39;s own boundaries and self.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,<br/>

be either/or?  Can&#39;t mums find a way to do the things they need and want to<br/>
in order to lead satisfying personal lives and still do the whole immersion<br/>
parenting thing too? I feel like I have, and now my kids are older I can<br/>
see the benefits in their behaviour and attitudes. They respect that there<br/>
mum is driven, passionate woman who won&#39;t put herself second or be<br/>
sacrificed to a traditional view of motherhood, yet firmly believes in<br/>
family values and mothering.... Isn&#39;t it just about arranging life, setting<br/>
priorities, etc? <br/>

I think you are absolutely right about this Beverly (IMHO).. However before <br/>
women get to this stage they need to know that this is a possibility and go <br/>
through the other stages first....I think that&#39;s what happened to me in life <br/>
with not working for other people.  I didn&#39;t realize for a long time that I <br/>
could work for myself and still be at home with the kids and have the kind of <br/>
life I wanted (this is when Zak went to preschool, which is what I thought <br/>
had to happen in order for me to accomplish &quot;my stuff&quot;) The next step was <br/>
realizing that I didn&#39;t have to send my kids away to get my needs met and <br/>
that with the support of dh and his constant involvement and chaning of his <br/>
work schedule we could all have our needs met.  I guess it just takes time to <br/>
come to those realizations.<br/>

a crisis pregnancy center or an organization like that?<br/>
I started volunteering in a local pregnancy helpline about 4 years ago (I <br/>
also was very close to becoming an unwed teen mother-lost the baby through <br/>
miscarriage).  I was paired up to mentor a young girl who was 16; very <br/>
estranged from her parents and very scared.  She ended up keeping her baby <br/>
and though wasn&#39;t our official foster child-she lived with us off and on <br/>
(with her parent&#39;s permission) and she and the baby both became very close to <br/>
us.  Now she&#39;s 19, living with her parents again temporarily, taking college <br/>
courses, working...and my 13 yog babysits for her 3yo son.  It&#39;s been a great <br/>
learning and giving experience all around.  My dh and I have learned a ton, <br/>
too.  It hasn&#39;t just been one-sided.<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share another way to tackle the desire without necessarily <br/>
becoming a foster parent.<br/>
