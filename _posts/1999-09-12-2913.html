Cathy and Barb,<br/>
We aren&#39;t that far south, we are about 45 minutes north of Macon.� We are down that<br/>
way on our travels to Florida-love the beaches!<br/>

&gt; I live in between Scott and Adrian.� The nearest larger towns are Dublin<br/>
&gt; and Swainsboro.� I am about an equal distance for both.� I am about an 65<br/>
&gt; miles or so southeast of Macon. How far south of Atlanta are you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>�<br/>
<br/>
Thomasville sounds familiar, but I&#39;m not sure where that is at in conjunction with<br/>
us--between Atlanta and Macon.� Henry county is where we are at, but we do<br/>
activities in Conyers, Jackson, Stockbridge, McDonough and Locust Grove.<br/>

only part unschoolers, the other part is undecided at the moment!<br/>
