 </span></blockquote>Dear Shyrley,<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to put up a tent by us, please come on! The name of our town <br/>
might make you feel at home (we live in the village of Cornwall-on-Hudson, <br/>
hard by Cornwall, NY, which is, in turn about an hour north of NYC by train <br/>
on the west bank of the Hudson). However having visited down in the &quot;real&quot; <br/>
Cornwall, I figure the similarity ends there... :^) Nonetheless, you and <br/>
yours would be right welcome. The house where we are is small, but the <br/>
outside part is pretty huge! And after you visit here, you can sidle on <br/>
across to Connecticut, where they&#39;ve got another Cornwall, and from there on <br/>
up to Ontario, where there&#39;s yet another :^)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Wynn<br/>
<br/>
P.S. This invite goes for any of you guys tenting around the country, Brits <br/>
or not :^)</div>
