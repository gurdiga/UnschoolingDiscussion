If you took a course on unschooling and had to go to class a time or two a <br/>

It keeps you from biting your nails, picking at your scabs, twirling your <br/>

unschooling and letting it go a bit.&quot; so I checked back in. The <br/>
stress WENT AWAY. Well, it comes and goes now, as we continue, and <br/>
self-doubt creeps in, but at the time, reading here again (and a <br/>
little bit at the unschooling.com bulletin board) completely released <br/>
the stress, for quite a few days.<br/>

<br/>
I also went through a questioning phase of me being on the computer.   I was<br/>
on it alot at the beginning of our unschooling journey, but I had so much to<br/>
read ,  so much to learn.    It is tapering off now and I can now put it all<br/>
to use.  Its in balance.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at it as my work and research.   I have learned sooooo much being<br/>
here.  And I really feel like my children have benefited so much from what<br/>
I&#39;ve learned.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was so fun to read.<br/>
It&#39;s true.  It&#39;s funny... I&#39;ve been a mother for 10 years now, and <br/>
I&#39;ve had a computer for about the last 6, and I don&#39;t know how I <br/>
managed before I had one.  Surely my kids would be in school today <br/>
if it weren&#39;t for websites like unschooling.com.  I don&#39;t know how <br/>
pre-internet unschooling mothers stuck with it.<br/>
And the other funny thing is that in some parenting/unschooling <br/>
forums there are occasionally sarcastic comments about &quot;why don&#39;t <br/>
you go pay attention to your kids instead of spending so much time <br/>
on the computer&quot; when *I&#39;m* thinking that the computer might be the <br/>
best thing that happened to that person or his/her child.<br/>
Other than the time spent actually *with* your children, I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine a better place to spend time than with these wonderful <br/>
boards and lists.  I&#39;ve learned more in a shorter time period than I <br/>
can possibly imagine learning any other way.<br/>
My kids might never know how much they owe their fabulous childhood <br/>
to unschooling.com, and that&#39;s the way it should be, but *I&#39;ll* be <br/>
forever grateful!<br/>

not even read the book themselves to decide.<br/>
The strange thing is that they think Roald Dahl is fine and his books are<br/>
filled with magic and kids getting the better of their parents but Harry<br/>
Potter is evil.<br/>
BTW I love Roald Dahl. All of his children&#39;s books and especially the short<br/>
stories he wrote for adults.<br/>

about the movie Last Temptation of Christ.  (ANyone remember THAT furvor???)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we went back and forth about how wrong it was to &quot;take liberties&quot;<br/>
with someone&#39;s faith and how that wasn&#39;t what the movie did.  I finally said<br/>
something like, &quot;Well, in the scene where...whatever it was&quot; and he said,<br/>
&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Uhm, HUH???  Then how do you know what the movie does or doesn&#39;t do, I<br/>
asked.<br/>
<br/>
His answer??? &quot;I don&#39;t need to see it to know it&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, that was the end to that conversation.  Ugh.<br/>
