&gt;&gt; You have apparently not read enough economics to have understood the<br/>
&gt;&gt; concepts<br/>
&gt;&gt; of public goods and positive/negative externalities and some of the causes<br/>
&gt;&gt; and solutions to market failure. Neither have most of the other people<br/>
&gt;&gt; here,<br/>
&gt;&gt; so it is difficult for them to counter even some of the most simplistic<br/>
&gt;&gt; arguments, without the ability to draw upon and articulate those somewhat<br/>
&gt;&gt; more complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it<br/>
&gt;&gt; frustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; This is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because<br/>
&gt;&gt; they are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and<br/>
&gt;&gt; provide<br/>
&gt;&gt; plenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES<br/>
&gt;&gt; make<br/>
&gt;&gt; sense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of<br/>
&gt;&gt; our<br/>
&gt;&gt; tax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a<br/>
&gt;&gt; number<br/>
&gt;&gt; of other purposes.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; However, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics,<br/>
&gt;&gt; not even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for<br/>
&gt;&gt; that kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is<br/>
&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt; NHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Please EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get<br/>
&gt;&gt; perpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts<br/>
&gt;&gt; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; . If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop<br/>
&gt;&gt; responding<br/>
&gt;&gt; to them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and<br/>
&gt;&gt; want to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of<br/>
&gt;&gt; us<br/>
&gt;&gt; can delete the messages more easily. Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
After all that, it seems you could have more quickly just told us your own<br/>
theories instead of pompously assuming we are all unwashed gourds.<br/>
<br/>
You did mention that you could provide plenty of arguments, based on sound<br/>
economic reasoning. Tell us, would that be the reasoning behind the economic<br/>
boom of the 90s or the current bust? And what about the reasoning behind our<br/>
country&#39;s providing The Al Quaeda with $40M just days before 9/11...<br/>
<br/>
So please, teach us your sound economic reasoning. There&#39;s still time.<br/>

Ned, I object to your tone and your intent in this.  Pam Sorooshian has <br/>
helped unschoolers more over the years than I think you can ever hope to do <br/>
and she does not deserve your public disdain.<br/>
