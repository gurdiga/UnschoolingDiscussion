The thing I would wonder is what is she getting from <br/>
this?  I could be more specific, but my brain&#39;s fried.  <br/>
Hibernation really setting in...  Is it still called <br/>
hibernation when it&#39;s aminals which sleep through hot <br/>
seasons?  Tangent alert!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you can acknowledge that you ask her to do <br/>
this because you want her to, to reassure yourself that <br/>
she&#39;s getting an education, not because it&#39;s any use to <br/>
her...  I dunno, sorry if that&#39;s offensive, but it&#39;s <br/>
how I read it...<br/>

     We have homeschooled for 3 yrs. and we do several workbooks,  so I<br/>
guess we are not complete unschoolers.  I feel that my children should be<br/>
able to set their own pace and be able to pursue their own interests, but<br/>
not at the cost of neglect.  I do want them to be able to do things like<br/>
spell, mainly to feel confident about themselves.  My children also<br/>
happen to like workbooks (at least 2 of them do).  Variety never hurts<br/>
either.  I also consider myself new at this.  I learn new things daily!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898110764">Hi Marianne<br/>
<br/>
Does 12 year old object to doing workbook?  That is the only thing that<br/>
would make this a problem.  Perhaps talking with your child about what hir<br/>
goals on this subject are is a good idea. (You have probalby done this<br/>
already but I am only going on one post so sorry in advance ) If child<br/>
decides that workbooks offer little for hir, that is okay. Are you honest<br/>
with 12 year old about why you insist on work?  Is it to calm your worry?<br/>
Ask yourself why s/he needs to know this.<br/>
<br/>
An example from my own situation involves spelling. My oldest daughter, who<br/>
is 10 learned to read at about age 6.  because reading and writing are<br/>
lumped together in many curricula, I rahter expected her to be able to write<br/>
and spell as well. (changed views on this but will save for another<br/>
discussion) She did the common things in developing her writing, ie words<br/>
with just the consonant letters, then sticking the vowel letters on the end,<br/>
inverting consonant pairs, etc.  One day, when she was 8 1/2ish, she wrote<br/>
something which made me smile. She was trying to spell a certain word, but<br/>
to my adult eyes it said something different.  She got very cross with me<br/>
and I said well if you want to learn to spell properly, then lets start<br/>
doing lessons.  She responded by saying that she did not want to do lessons,<br/>
she wanted me to stop laughing at her.  SO i did. I set myelf a goal in my<br/>
own head to not worry about spelling until she was 10.  Then if I needed to<br/>
I was going to leave it another year etc etc.  But in the time that I left<br/>
her alone I saw her understanding grow and her spelling is pretty good now.<br/>
I have learned to trust both her and myself.  That is a hard lesson to learn<br/>
for us because we have had to distrust ourselves in order to survive in<br/>
institutional settings. Since most of us have been schooled it is hard to<br/>
begin to think of life in an unschool-type way.  But even older children can<br/>
grasp concepts without being &quot;taught&quot;.  We also have to question why we<br/>
assume that we need to know certain things?  Your child may already know all<br/>
of the math that s/he will ever need to know. If not, a choice later to<br/>
attend a course may alter the situation. But the choice is hirs.<br/>
Peace<br/>
