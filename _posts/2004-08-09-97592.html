<div id="ygrps-yiv-967697442">As I was browsing the 261 yahoogroups under &quot;Waldorf&quot;,<br/>
I came across the following that I wanted to share<br/>
with this group.  Perhaps these will be of interest to<br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf-Recoverygroup<br/>
...for those experiencing post traumatic stress...<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf-Survivors-Only<br/>
...support group for those who have had strongly<br/>
negative experiences with Waldorf schools...<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf_Craft<br/>
<br/>
...to discuss the Waldorf style of craft- doll and toy<br/>
making, felting, knitting etc.<br/>
<br/>
JewishWaldorf<br/>
<br/>
...discussion of issues facing Jews who choose to do<br/>
Waldorf education...the potentials and difficulties of<br/>
combining Waldorf and Judaism...<br/>
<br/>
Anthroposophyparent<br/>
<br/>
...caring for the home and family in the light of<br/>
anthroposophy...topics may include: homemaking,<br/>
festival life, health, nutrition, care of children,<br/>
family relations etc.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and this was the one I was *really* looking<br/>
for:<br/>
<br/>
Waldorfunschool<br/>
<br/>
...a forum to discuss Waldorf Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there are only 8 members to this group,<br/>
so I don&#39;t know how useful it really would be.<br/>
