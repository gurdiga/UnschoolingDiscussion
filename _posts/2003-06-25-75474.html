 </span></blockquote>One of my biggest regrets is getting past my comfort level when Lars was 12<br/>
and pushing him to work on phonics.  Yes, he did end up reading.  No, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like reading.  Maybe he wouldn&#39;t have liked it anyway, but<br/>
considering how much he loved being read tobefore that time, I doubt it.<br/>
The whole exercise just seems to have turned him off.  He even stopped<br/>
wanting to be read to.  So work on it . . . work on it!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
