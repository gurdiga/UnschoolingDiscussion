&lt;&lt; WHat we have done so far is to <br/>
<br/>
come up with a definition of tattling and telling. At our house, <br/>
<br/>
tattling is when you are trying to get someone INTO trouble, and <br/>
<br/>
telling is when you are trying to stop trouble. IF you aren&#39;t sure, <br/>
<br/>
come tell, because it&#39;s better to tell when you shouldn&#39;t than to <br/>
<br/>
not tell when you should. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be better not to even use the term &quot;telling.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s another phrase for tattling which is &quot;to tell on&quot; someone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of defining what a child is doing when he wants to talk to his <br/>
mom, it should just be &quot;talking to his mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The current issue of People Magazine has an article on the final defense in <br/>
Scott Peterson&#39;s trial, the statements made by those appealing for life <br/>
imprisonment over the death sentence.    Scott&#39;s brother, John Peterson, is quoted as <br/>
saying this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He was a great kid brother.  He hardly ever told on me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A younger brother praised for not discussing with his mother what another <br/>
sibling was doing that was bad.  <br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a judge or attorney involved with that, I would immediately assume <br/>
that John Peterson&#39;s opinion/testimony was worth very little, as his <br/>
definition of &quot;a great brother&quot; involved &quot;not telling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a very bad statement to have made.  And it reflects badly on the <br/>
mother, from my point of view.   <br/>
