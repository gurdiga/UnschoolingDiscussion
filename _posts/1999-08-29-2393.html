<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017204133">I think your solutions sound wonderful!  I always admired my aunt&#39;s family<br/>
(8 kids on a farm) because it seemed like they all pitched in and did what<br/>
needed to be done and enjoyed doing it.  That was a child&#39;s perspective, of<br/>
course, and they may have gotten along better with company around and it may<br/>
have been more structured than it appeared to my child&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
My sister has 3 kids and she has charts and points and rewards and she has<br/>
to keep upping the points earned and the points neccessary to receive<br/>
things.  (Did that make sense?)  The usual rewards are Beanie Babies and<br/>
before long they either don&#39;t have a Beanie that they really want or they<br/>
just don&#39;t want to do the jobs - so they don&#39;t.  This has escalted to the<br/>
point that they now get 500 pts a day if they keep their rooms &quot;reasonably&quot;<br/>
picked up - meaning if you can&#39;t see the mess from the doorway!<br/>
<br/>
Of course you never know how life will turn out BUT - IMHO - your kids will<br/>
grow up to be well adjusted adults who know how to share space and<br/>
responsibilities.  Of course one of them will probably be a hermit in a huge<br/>
house, seeking space and quiet and choosing not to recreate his/her crazy<br/>
childhood!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooler or not, you all live there and you all have to pitch in or you<br/>
would never dig your way to the door!  Hmm - or they could be digging their<br/>
way to the door to go visit Mom after she has a complete breakdown!<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work and let us know when #7 arrives!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Becky for your nice comments.  I already have one (my oldest) who has <br/>
this sort of life envisioned for herself!!  Of course, I thought about myself <br/>
living like this too...once upon a time!<br/>
<br/>
#7 is due in early December and I&#39;ll be sure to let everyone know!<br/>
<br/>
Take care...<br/>
