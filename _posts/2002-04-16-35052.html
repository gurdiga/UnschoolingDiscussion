Have you read any books by John Holt? He is known as the &quot;father of<br/>
unschooling&quot;<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith can be found at your local<br/>
bookstore, It explains unschooling very well.<br/>
Try some of these resources and you may find some clarity!<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

I am printing this out so I can take it with me to the library.  (Where<br/>
Chaelene is frequently wanting to go).  If I can&#39;t find them there then I<br/>
will try Vegas next time we go in.<br/>
