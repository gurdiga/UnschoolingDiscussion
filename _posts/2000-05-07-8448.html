<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523043583">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I have a question, I came to you all because many of you know how I feel <br/>
about the things I am going to talk about. <br/>
<br/>
I have a problem with the neighbor girl. My ds and dd are 10 and 9. The <br/>
neighbor girl is 13 and public schooled. Now I know many very sweet ps teens <br/>
so please don&#39;t think I am being purely prejudice. I feel like an ogre when I <br/>
say that I can&#39;t stand this girl. She is one of the most self centered people <br/>
I have ever met, adult or child. Almost to the point of being sociopathic. I <br/>
have tried to keep my children and her fairly separate over the past three <br/>
years, simply because this girl welds the age thing over my children&#39;s heads <br/>
so effectively. The power is not equal, you know what I mean? She is very <br/>
manipulative and talks incessantly about what her parents buy her, how much <br/>
her clothes cost, how she has a horse, (which my dd in the middle of a horse <br/>
phase would love to have.) and I feel it is breeding discontent, in my <br/>
daughter especially. We have chosen to live more deliberately. We have told <br/>
our children many times why we live as we do, so that we can spend more time <br/>
together, do more things together ect. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason my kids seem to hang on her every word. Which frustrates me <br/>
to know end as I have tried to raise them outside the box. I am not an <br/>
isolationist. I want my children to be exposed to a variety of ideas and <br/>
people. But I am worried about the influence the girl will have on my <br/>
daughter. They have plenty of friends but this girl is so close that it is <br/>
hard. I am not especially welcoming to this child but she doesn&#39;t take the <br/>
hint very well. I feel horrible..... she is just a child.... but really I <br/>
don&#39;t feel like this is good for my DD who seems to be easily influenced.<br/>
<br/>
So the question. Do I just say enough is enough tell the neighbor lady <br/>
sweetly that I feel her dughter is just too old to play with my daughter? <br/>
Which, of course, is going to create horrible neighborhood relations. I have <br/>
tried just keeping the kids otherwise occupied when she is around but I don&#39;t <br/>
want to feel like I can&#39;t even let my kids out to play!!!!! LOL This girls <br/>
best friend, across the street, will be moving away and summer is <br/>
coming.......I see conflict ahead. Any advice???? Any at all??? Even if it is <br/>
just to tell me how horrible I am for having such a deep dislike for a <br/>
child??? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Teri</div>
