&gt;<br/>
&gt; Very Cool!! Was it for you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was too young for it to be very cool. One thing I remember (and, relating<br/>
back to unschooling, this gives me a way to relate to how my kids learn<br/>
things like language) is that I had this word in my life that I never could<br/>
figure out. It was &quot;Bureau&quot;. My dad drove a &quot;Bureau car&quot;, my mom hung out<br/>
with &quot;Bureau wives&quot;, they went to &quot;Bureau functions&quot; and parties. It was<br/>
like I could never get a handle on what the word meant, because it seemed to<br/>
apply to everything. I think I was finally 13 or so when I had a &quot;duh&quot;<br/>
moment and understood that &quot;Bureau&quot; was FBI.<br/>
<br/>
One cool thing about my dad is that he gave up this great career in the FBI<br/>
to move back to Oregon because back then the Bureau moved agents around<br/>
every two years and it was very destabilizing for the kids. So he quit when<br/>
I was 7. It was nice, I got to live next to both sets of grandparents and<br/>
grow up in a small town/rural environment where I had a ton of freedom -<br/>
riding bikes all over the place as kids, etc. That&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve always<br/>
really respected about him, that he put our family first. He was always the<br/>
type to come home right at 5:00 too and play with us kids too.<br/>
<br/>
He does have some great stories. He once helped rescue the actor who played<br/>
Hop Sing on Bonanza from an airplane hijacking. Hey, I guess that makes me 3<br/>
degrees from Michael Landon and the others on that show.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guitar. Not terribly well, mind you, but I&#39;m a great songwriter (at least in<br/>
my own mind :-). Also, it was a great way to work out all that teen angst<br/>
over school and all. I have lots of songs and writings about how much school<br/>
felt like a prison. Come to think of it, back to the 6 degrees thread, the<br/>
singer in my band was an actor in the movie &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (one of the<br/>
friends of the older brother of the main character), so that makes me two<br/>
degrees from Rob Reiner, one of my favorite directors.<br/>

When I was first married (to #1) I worked at a Beer and Wine in a small town <br/>
in Maryland. Dwight Yoakum&#39;s half brother lived in town and would come in to <br/>
buy orange soda and cheap wine. He mixed them together.<br/>
Unfortunately, he was very large, sweaty, and not even close to looking like <br/>
Dwight&#39;s brother.<br/>
