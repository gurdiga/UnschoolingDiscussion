<div id="ygrps-yiv-947431781">I&#39;ve been having discussion both here and at the message board about how my <br/>
shift in thinking came about, how long it took etc...<br/>
And I&#39;ve taken some heat for it, so I thought I&#39;d share an old post here, <br/>
hopefully to inspire someone (or maybe make someone laugh).<br/>
The cool thing is, I had argued for tv limits prior to the following post, <br/>
and it&#39;s obvious I was thinking about things and not completely convinced <br/>
about tv limits anymore by the time I posted this.....so here it is, and it <br/>
was not long after that I let go completely.<br/>
Reading back on it, I realize where my sons obssesive behavior came <br/>
from....ME!!<br/>
Me and my controlling methods. sigh.....<br/>

Kim, I totally know what you mean! I have one that will do nothing but veg if <br/>
allowed complete access. He will even forget to eat...how healthy is that? I <br/>
mean he could go ALL day with no food, completely excluding any and all <br/>
activity to focus on tv or gameboy. Dh and I just can&#39;t watch him do this day <br/>
after day...we encourage him to turn it off after a while, or we insist on <br/>
going somewhere of his choosing to get him looking in other directions. There <br/>
are some very addictive individuals...I really hope that by allowing him a <br/>
lot of control and gradually giving more and more he will learn a balance for <br/>
himself. My other kids aren&#39;t like that at all. It could partly be the almost <br/>
12 y.o. thing too in his case...I try to remember that. <br/>
<br/>
As to the waiting for &quot;magical&quot; moments and trusting they will absorb <br/>
learning....it really does happen! My oldest was totally hyper at <br/>
three...couldn&#39;t seem to focus long at all. I even gave up on library story <br/>
times with him, just too stressful for me! He didn&#39;t want to learn how to <br/>
count..all his friends seemed to pick up on this stuff before him. But guess <br/>
what? It didn&#39;t matter that he learned it later than them...he knows it now. <br/>
He reads avidly. He&#39;s addicted to tv--read above whining--but when we <br/>
&quot;unplug&quot; him he is full of interesting conversation and intellect. I recently <br/>
was taught the value of trusting him again (I know, I know Sandra...I don&#39;t <br/>
totally trust him if I limit tv or gameboy!) He had been interested in <br/>
learning some magic tricks a few months back so we went to the library <br/>
and I helped him check out a bunch of books. He learned some cool card tricks <br/>
(we still can&#39;t figure out how he does some of them) and then his interest <br/>
faded. I was kinda sad to see him not pursue something I saw as a positive <br/>
interest but knew I should not/could not push it or say anything....it would <br/>
only turn him off. So a few months passes and all of the sudden the last few <br/>
days he is online looking to buy some magic props and practicing up on his <br/>
old tricks, now talking about starting a business out of entertaining at kids <br/>
Birthday parties. So interests come and go. Same for us. And what seems to be <br/>
no interest one day can turn into obsession not much later. I really do trust <br/>
them for the most part...obviously I have a hard time with too much tv, I see <br/>
it as inactivity. I HAVE however, learned to not view it as a negative <br/>
influence as I did previously. And I give them A LOT of say and control over <br/>
their time now. If I think it&#39;s getting overwhelming I just ask them to come <br/>
up with a plan for the day....&quot;where can we go that would be fun?&quot; usually <br/>
works. This 11 1/2 y.o. lethargy can be discouraging!! I hear some others <br/>
going through it and try to relax..... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren from January 2003 now:<br/>
I think that first paragraph shows how I was trying to &quot;transition&quot; also....I <br/>
was hearing what everyone was saying and trying to let go of control. It came <br/>
in fits and starts before leveling out and becoming natural.<br/>
So any newbies that are discouraged, please don&#39;t think it&#39;s the relaxing and <br/>
trusting your kids that is wrong.<br/>
When parents change, it is something the children don&#39;t understand <br/>
completely. There is a transition time for all and it takes thought, <br/>
encouragement, tweaking and trusting.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen overnight for those of us that don&#39;t have this <br/>
understanding the moment our children are born.<br/>
I envy those that do!!<br/>
I was raised in a very strict Christian sect, so there was a lot to <br/>
overcome....but it DOES work. Trusting my children has changed the entire <br/>
tone of our home. <br/>
Being  a mother has never been better. <br/>
Don&#39;t give up. <br/>
Keep posting when things don&#39;t work and let everyone give you input, even if <br/>
it hurts and causes frustration.<br/>
Because that&#39;s what got me where I am today.<br/>
I had so many times I&#39;d come back on and say JOYCE, SANDRA, ANNE!!! My kid is <br/>
STiLL addicted, what do I do?<br/>
And they would calmly, pointedly tell me &quot;DEAL with it&quot; :) in a nicer way <br/>
actually.<br/>
They gave me advice that changed our lives.<br/>
It worked. It will always work. But only if we as the adults are willing for <br/>
immensely difficult and sometimes painful change.<br/>
Hang in there ..........<br/>
