<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951882614">Hi All--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days, so thought I&#39;d say, &quot;Hi.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m mom to three unschoolers, ages 5, 11 and 14 (well, 15 next week--<br/>
YIKES!) We started out as reluctant public schoolers, then <br/>
homeschooled briefly in a school-at-home manner until I realized that <br/>
was just plain stupid, and then took a deep breath and let ourselves <br/>
become unschoolers. We&#39;re in our 6th year and life simply <br/>
feels...RIGHT. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really pleased to find this list, as I used to lurk on the <br/>
unschooling.com boards and recognize a few names from there. Those <br/>
boards really made me think and re-examine some assumptions about <br/>
learning, as I hope (I&#39;m sure) this list will.<br/>
<br/>
