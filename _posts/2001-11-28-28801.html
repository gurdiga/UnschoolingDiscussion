<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060279411">Yes, I do. But when that child&#39;s lack of academics rolls over and has an<br/>
affect on her social life, what then? Children can be cruel, not even<br/>
realizing it. The only kids who *don&#39;t* point out these &quot;academic<br/>
differences&quot; are the cousins whose parents have been warned by me that this<br/>
is a hot button and to try to explain it to their kids to be kind ,etc.<br/>
Should a parent go to all perspective playmates and their parents and say,<br/>
&quot;look.. my child can&#39;t do xxx so please don&#39;t bring these things up. No<br/>
board games that involve math, please... she can&#39;t keep up. Oh! and no<br/>
reading games... can&#39;t do  that, either.&quot;<br/>
Hm?????? I&#39;m not being sarcastic...<br/>
Sarah<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sarah:<br/>
I&#39;m wondering whether her noticing that other children &quot;know&quot; things may<br/>
help her,  at least in motivation.  My dd is a late reader....she&#39;ll be 10<br/>
in a month.  Can&#39;t read much at all...not even a Dr. Seuss.  However,  she<br/>
is a thoughtful,  creative, intelligent person with excellent problem<br/>
solving skills.<br/>
<br/>
I have never tried to protect her by asking anyone to play a non-reading<br/>
game or give her any other special treatment.   I hope she reads....but I<br/>
keep my struggles to myself - or share them with this list or another<br/>
understanding person.<br/>
Food for thought...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875190638">Yes, I know but then, do you *ever* step in and *do* something? I mean,<br/>
hind-sight is 20/20. If I had *known* that this child would have such<br/>
problems now because of not learning this stuff whenever she felt like it,<br/>
I&#39;d have done something about it sooner. I would have pushed a little. But I<br/>
didn&#39;t ... I did the very unschooling &quot;let her do it when she&#39;s ready..<br/>
leave her alone&quot; thing and now, I&#39;m not so sure it was the *right* thing to<br/>
do for *THIS* child.<br/>
  ~~~OR~~~~<br/>
  will all of this experience lead her *to* her dreams of being a rock<br/>
star????????<br/>
  Somebody *please* .... pass me the parenting manual!<br/>
  Sarah<br/>
<br/>
  Sarah:<br/>
<br/>
Of course,  I responded before reading all the thread.....I feel for you<br/>
and can SO relate to your struggle due to my experience with my dd.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know when or how to step in at times....and with mine being the oldest, I<br/>
have this horrible thought that somehow I make every parenting mistake with<br/>
her...which benefits her younger siblings,  but goodness knows I sometimes<br/>
wish I could&#39;ve learned on a robotic child or someone who wouldn&#39;t be harmed<br/>
by my mistakes!!<br/>
<br/>
When I read your comments above,  I couldn&#39;t help but say to you......you<br/>
have NO IDEA how she would be doing if you had intervened,  pushed,  etc.<br/>
Maybe you&#39;d have only made her totally miserable  ...and ruined her<br/>
self-image.   Tell us/me about her ....what is great about her?<br/>
<br/>
Also,  have you read the book - can&#39;t think of the name - on seven types of<br/>
intelligence?  Somebody here will know it - focus on her strengths,  believe<br/>
in her....and let her know.    And try to let go of *your* goals for her.<br/>
Wish you well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662636583">Thank you, Susan. I think the book you&#39;re referring to is by Thomas Armstrong and yes, I read it a long time ago. Need to re-read it. <br/>
It&#39;s amazing. DD has no idea I&#39;ve been discussing this on the list. Tonight, she came to me and said something about StarSearch and is it still in existence. I said yes. She said, well, Mom.. I&#39;ve got to get ON that show!  I&#39;m just hoping my mouth didn&#39;t drop open in utter amazement!  I responded that we should probably start out with a singing lesson or two at the local School of Arts (they offer community courses) and she seemed so proud that *she* could attend a &quot;college&quot; &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Of course not.  We just went through this with Adriane.  She was teased at<br/>
her gymnastics class because 1)she is the only homeschooler and 2)she hadn&#39;t<br/>
memorized her times tables.  She stood there and took it from these girls<br/>
because...well..that&#39;s Adriane.  But she was upset when she got home.  I<br/>
pointed out that she could learn those things very easily if she wanted to<br/>
but that it would take time and effort on her part.  I pointed out all the<br/>
things she knew that these girls probably didn&#39;t (like the gestation period<br/>
of rabbits, breeds of dairy goats, etc.).  I pointed out that no one knows<br/>
exactly all the things that someone else knows.  I pointed out that everyone<br/>
gets teased about something (a viewing of my ears was always good for a<br/>
laugh).  She opted to learn her multiplication tables.<br/>

<br/>
What would you have done?  If working with her at 11 at her request in as<br/>
many different ways as you can think of isn&#39;t doing the trick, what would<br/>
you have done years ago that would have changed anything?<br/>
<br/>
You post of your dd over-reacting to difficulty with a task.  Have you read<br/>
any of Holt&#39;s writings on anxiety and learning difficulty?  My 8yo son is a<br/>
highly anxious kid and has great difficulty focusing on reading without my<br/>
rubbing his back.  Just a thought.<br/>

Ack!!!!!  Actually, unschooling means that our CHILDREN are free to figure<br/>
out what THEY need for THEMSELVES.  Does that mean that a child will always<br/>
be able to verbalize a need?  No.  But it means that they are ALWAYS free to<br/>
accept or decline help.<br/>

Nobody said anything is magical about 11. That just happens to be the age of my child at the moment.  <br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve read Holt on learning disabilities and everything else I could read of his.<br/>
Yes, here we are on an unschooling board but  NOBODY is forcing a child to see a therapist; it&#39;s just one of many options. <br/>
I don&#39;t need Sandra to give me her input; I&#39;ve gotten quite a bit of positive feedback from other thoughtful, well-meaning, experienced people on this list. Lots of helpful ideas and suggestions and only a *few* who have offered empty-minded posts. Refreshing...<br/>

<br/>
From personal experience, children can be 11, 12, or 13+ and still not <br/>
reading well and then BAM.. they get it. Something just clicks. Usually <br/>
teaching themselves to read because they want to. They want to read Nintendo <br/>
Power magazine, or Pokemon catds.<br/>
Why push and force a child to read, making them feel worthless, when if you <br/>
wait 6 months they take off on their own.<br/>
Patience is the biggest gift we can give our children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, here&#39;s one you might mention to your daughter.  Wyndham couldn&#39;t<br/>
read because he believed he couldn&#39;t do it.  My mom moved in next door<br/>
and he started going there regularly for the food.  But the price of the<br/>
food was that she got to &quot;teach&quot; him.  He&#39;s perfectly okay with that<br/>
arrangement.  He gets attention and food and I run interference if she<br/>
gets too pushy about it to suit him.<br/>
Now, I realized something a few days ago . . . the reason she could help<br/>
him learn to read and I couldn&#39;t is because I have no patience for<br/>
repetition.  She was a special ed. teacher for 14 years and taught second<br/>
grade before that.  The &#39;read the same book three thousand times&#39; thing<br/>
doesn&#39;t phase her a bit.  The patience to listen to him sound out the<br/>
same word six times on the same page doesn&#39;t reside in me, but it does in<br/>
her.  <br/>
So tell your daughter that the key to learning this stuff may just be<br/>
patience to do it again and again.  Mind you , I didn&#39;t say make her sit<br/>
there and do it whether she wants to or not, just tell her that she<br/>
should be patient with herself and that you will be patient with her.<br/>
