<div id="ygrps-yiv-300891014">Thank you!  She is. And I can&#39;t take credit for it.  When she was at ps she<br/>
made our lives miserable.  When she was homeschooled, she wouldn&#39;t do one<br/>
thing I wanted her to do.  Finally, just to get a little peace, I backed off<br/>
and let her do her own thing!       Deb K.<br/>

You did a good job.  Your daughter sounds like an awesome person.  :-)<br/>

...Yes!  We are hearing this!  My daughter did a few courses at college and<br/>
  hated jumping through the hoops.  She has decided to start her own<br/>
business.<br/>
  This is a girl who when interested in a subject will bring home 15 books<br/>
  from the library, read endlessly, take notes, etc.  Right now she is<br/>
taking<br/>
  a lot of flack from her friends (all at college).  Finally she got them<br/>
off<br/>
  her back by telling them she wouldn&#39;t have to wait 4 years to start living<br/>
  her dream AND she wouldn&#39;t owe thousands of dollars either!      Deb K.</div>
