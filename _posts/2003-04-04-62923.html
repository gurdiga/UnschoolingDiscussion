<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094840942">I did take the list intro to heart and have been reading here for a few months, so the shock has worn off! &lt;g&gt; My husband and I have three great kids: Joseph (11), Alyssa (almost 9), and Michael (5). I would like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the long-time participants on this list for their wonderful insights and thoughtful discussions.  Many of the discussions (and repeat discussions!) over the past few months have really resonated with me: TV/video games; special needs; bedtimes; sibling fighting; chores; food; not to mention learning!  And I have been checking out many of the book recommendations . if the library staff ever look over the list of books I have out at any given time, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be rather bewildered!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have been making this journey on our own, albeit slowly, since our first child was born. It started with not believing &quot;the experts&quot; who said eating and sleeping schedules are good, that meltdowns are about control, that he was just manipulating me, etc. I brushed them aside, but school and work outside the home were a-given, just permanent features of the landscape to be worked around. But, what is it they say, if things don&#39;t seem to be working as you expect, check your premises? (Actually, I picked that up from Atlas Shrugged many years ago and it has served me well so far &lt;g&gt;).  So, I ditched work three years ago, and school last year . or more rightly I told the kids I found out there was this thing called homeschooling and they all jumped at the offer to stay home!  I may *think* I&#39;m driving, though truly, since they were born they have been dragging me through this journey, but I just love being along for the ride!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They left school March 2002 - they just didn&#39;t return after March Break.  For weeks they deschooled and I read about homeschooling. I did try to introduce a bit of structure (unit studies, math & spelling workbooks) somewhere around May, but that didn&#39;t last more than 3-4 weeks.  Can you believe it??  They flatly refused to stop their own learning activities to humour me! LOL!  So began the next leg of my journey into unschooling, which thankfully brought me here. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And, once I&#39;d begun to trust the kids more and more to take control of their learning, I couldn&#39;t help but realize they could be trusted to take control of other aspects of their lives . TV, video games, sleeping, food etc.  You guys have helped me so much to stretch that last bit.  It hasn&#39;t been a &quot;big&quot; change for us, just a bit more loosening of the reins. Early on I subscribed to the &quot;pick your battles&quot; mantra and I was *very* selective.  I could often understand why they were behaving in certain ways, that they were reactions to outside situations/forces, so our &quot;battles&quot; were relatively few and it just meant redrawing a few lines (or more rightly, erasing them).  There was no need for an &quot;announcement&quot; of a new lifestyle to the kids, just a bit of surprise on their part when they nudged a line and it was no longer there; just an honest discussion with Mom or Dad. We realized that for us it really comes down to principles, not rules (and a good chunk of deschooling on our part!). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s a bit of background for my intro.  I hope to share many of the interesting stories and insights I have gathered over the past year on the various topics of &quot;radical&quot; unschooling as I try to contribute more in the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And thanks again to everyone for taking the time and effort to participate on this wonderful list!<br/>

<br/>
PS  I&#39;m planning a family road trip in August for the conference. I&#39;ve already MapBlast-ed it ... 13hrs 41mins to the hotel ... no problem! Here&#39;s hoping I can pull all the details together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666402854">LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you recall, but there is a brief passage in Altas Shrugged about a homschooling mother with two young sons - she has chosen raising a family as her &quot;career&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They did not have the look she had seen in the children of the outer world - a look of fear, half-secretive, half-sneering, the look of a child&#39;s defense against an adult, the look of a being in the process of discovering that he is hearing lies and of learning to feel hatred. The two boys had the open, joyous, friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt, they had an innocently natural, non-boastful sense of their own value and as innocent a trust in any stranger&#39;s ability to recognize it, they had the eager curiousity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life held nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery, and they looked as if, should they encounter malevolence, they would reject it contemptuously, not as dangerous, but as stupid, they would not accept it in bruised resignation as the law of existence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was given a copy by my father to read the summer I was 14, presented as kind of a right of passage. I didn&#39;t have to analyze it in school, so I surely may have interpreted it differently! &lt;g&gt;  I have read it a few times, but it&#39;s fresh in my mind since my husband, who does not like reading, just listened to it on CD. I find the message I take from it positive (though I know people who find the book depressing), a reminder to think for myself, not to follow blindly what society says is &quot;right&quot;, and to always work to the best of my ability, no matter what task I undertake.<br/>
<br/>
And I have a couple Thich Nhat Hanh books out from the library, thanks to recommendations on this list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322190982">LOL -- I agree. Although I think what Ayn Rand&#39;s books gave me was also <br/>
a strong internal sense that I am MAKING choices - that I do have <br/>
choices. I think lots of people don&#39;t really feel that way. Gee, maybe <br/>
it is 13 years of schooling in which the only way to be content and <br/>
happy was to NOT strain against the many rules and to accept it that <br/>
much of life means not having any choices. Most people seem to have <br/>
gotten that message loud and clear - what is really interesting is that <br/>
some of us did not.<br/>

It&#39;s funny, your post caught me right away. We also have a Joseph and<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know if you recall, but there is a brief passage in Altas Shrugged <br/>
about a homschooling mother with two young sons - she has chosen raising a <br/>
family as her &quot;career&quot;: &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No!  I didn&#39;t notice or remember that in those long-ago times.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you VERY much for quoting it, because I&#39;m not reading that book again. <br/>
<br/>
My husband was reading it a while back, and it was on the windowsill in our <br/>
bathroom.  I would eye it in peripheral vision like it was a little bit <br/>
dangerous and might jump down on my while my pants were down.<br/>
