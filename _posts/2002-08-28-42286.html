<div id="ygrps-yiv-261856726">Dear Helen,<br/>
<br/>
I must tell you that from my point of view, about 50% of the posts that get <br/>
me thinking, are the ones from Ned. I frequently disagree with him, but since <br/>
I&#39;ve always enjoyed a good debate, that&#39;s O.K. Although I enjoy many of the <br/>
parenting type posts, I don&#39;t have much to say on that subject. My children <br/>
are 13 and 11, and after years of playgroup and parent discussions it all is <br/>
getting a little old.  A few years ago I realized that I missed the more <br/>
adult discussions I could engage in before children and before moving to a <br/>
small town filled with busybodies.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that Sandra is probably an old friend to you, and perhaps because <br/>
of that friendship and history, I think perhaps you can&#39;t see that she&#39;s had <br/>
it in for Ned from the start, because she&#39;s met her match in him. She has <br/>
systematically attacked every thing he posts in order to get everyone up in <br/>
arms. Soon after her little war began, Joyce joined in (it seemed out of <br/>
loyalty to Sandra). If the two of them had just stopped their own tirades <br/>
about his so-called ranting, and had stopped bossing everyone around, the <br/>
whole flow of discussions would have soon returned to normal. Although I&#39;ve <br/>
found her to be just as controlling and pushy in her opinions, I haven&#39;t <br/>
suggested banning her. I think banning should be reserved for the perverted <br/>
and violent. But if you are going to start banning those who flood the list <br/>
with posts of their own agendas and opinions, then perhaps she should be put <br/>
on a forced posting holiday as well. And after her, perhaps Joyce could have <br/>
a little leave of absence as moderator, and after her perhaps Tia or Mary? <br/>
Once you start banning people based on some vague sort of popularity contest, <br/>
you are heading down a very slippery slope.<br/>
<br/>
Up until now I have been happy to think you were very cool headed and <br/>
objective about these stupid squabbles. When you named this list with a very <br/>
general name such as Unschooling, I would think you would have been inviting <br/>
all topics that even remotely relate to Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If the list continues in the direction of banning dissenting views I suppose <br/>
I&#39;ll have to unsubscribe. I  may be not much loss to the list, but it would <br/>
be sad for me to have to leave in order to live by my own ethical standards.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sherry</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for taking the time to share your views, Sherry, but if I&#39;d <br/>
allowed Ned to continue disrupting and controlling the list I&#39;d have <br/>
been compromising my own standards as listowner. This list doesn&#39;t <br/>
ban dissenting views, but it&#39;s not going to be hijacked by someone <br/>
with a bad attitude, either. It sounds like you&#39;d probably be happier <br/>
on another list, perhaps the NHEN-Legislative list (lots to think <br/>
about there) or maybe that new one someone started just for Ned.<br/>

too. Some things people need a little time to work out; however, I <br/>
don&#39;t appreciate the accusations of favoritism (FYI, I raise my <br/>
eyebrow at Sandra&#39;s posts quite often), and I especially don&#39;t care <br/>
for the badmouthing of our sweetheart of a moderator, Joyce. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t her decision to banish Ned - it was mine and mine alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then I think you should follow up on that! :-) I&#39;m glad Ned was here to show<br/>
people a doorway into something else. This list just can&#39;t be that something<br/>
else because we&#39;re already something. And that something won&#39;t change<br/>
because there will always be people new to unschooling and that&#39;s pretty<br/>
much the foundation of this list. (Though it tries to offer more for those<br/>
already unschooling, as long as it doesn&#39;t interfer with that foundation.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s perfectly natural for people to grow beyond the focus of a list. If<br/>
you&#39;re only finding half a list useful -- *any* list -- then it&#39;s probably a<br/>
good indication you need something different.<br/>
<br/>
Ned&#39;s not lost his voice! :-) His voice is just elsewhere:<br/>

Geez. That sounds like he&#39;s off in another dimension or something, <br/>
like those bad guys Superman used to send to the phantom zone or <br/>
wherever it was he sent them. Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought the list needed a rest. Or maybe I needed a rest.<br/>
