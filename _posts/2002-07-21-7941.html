 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to write this, but I don&#39;t exactly <br/>
lurk. It&#39;s more that I don&#39;t (can&#39;t) read for a long time, then swoop in <br/>
to snatch some great ideas...and I think a homeschool resource center is <br/>
a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
When we started our homeschool theater group several years ago we began <br/>
renting space in an old church (congregation of about 45, mostly <br/>
elderly). The space was very affordable and we brought life (and money) <br/>
to the church people. Over the years I&#39;ve thought many times about how <br/>
great it would be to buy the building and use all the classrooms for <br/>
homeschooling activities: classes, clubs, a lending library, a science <br/>
lab, etc.--even maybe turn the sanctuary into a basketball court. The <br/>
big problem would be maintenance, since old buildings are notorious for <br/>
that; there would probably also be safety issues.<br/>
<br/>
The theater has taken up so much of my time that the resource center <br/>
idea never got developed, but I&#39;m interested in seeing what ideas can be <br/>
generated by other people about that. Just imagine homeschoolers from <br/>
all around knowing there&#39;s a place to go to hang out and be in touch.<br/>
<br/>
Susan, whose cousin, a public school teacher her whole life (as was her <br/>
mother, my aunt) has been visiting us for a week now...and neither of us <br/>
has mentioned homeschooling to any extent....</div>
