&lt;&lt; No one can take you off the list - you have to do that yourself under your <br/>
Yahoo Groups preferences. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I would hate to live in a world where no one could take anyone off a list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also not thrilled about being in a world where people who have no clue <br/>
how to get off a list the signed on to would be homeschoolers.  People do <br/>
learn more about computers and people do ask nicely sometimes.  I hope those <br/>
who can do neither will put their kids in school, though.<br/>
