hehe Just kidding.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean.  Our support group (Fundie but that is our only<br/>
choice) asked me to direct the Spring play &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;.  We are<br/>
having a ball.  Rehearsals are full of laughter, ideas, creativity.  The<br/>
kids and I do all the blocking together, working it out as we go.  The kids<br/>
have had some fantastic ideas on how to work things and I go with their<br/>
ideas.  Of course, this leads to a certain level of chaos but I am very<br/>
pleased with how things are going.<br/>
<br/>
Got a phone call from one of the moms.  Things aren&#39;t organized enough for<br/>
her.  A plan should have been made ahead of time.  The kids aren&#39;t going to<br/>
know what to do, you can&#39;t rely on these kids (teens) to know what props<br/>
they need, yada, yada, yada.  I tried to calm her until I realized I was<br/>
wasting my breath.  She plans to take her concerns to the other parents<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;.  Luckily, the parents who have actually sat in on rehearsals are<br/>
pleased with how things are coming together.<br/>

progessing??  Where are thier concerns coming from??  Landon is in drama at <br/>
school.. I know most of the times, the show seems like its falling apart, <br/>
NOTHING will work out.. its chaos  he worries and frets that it will  suck <br/>
bit time..Til show time.. then, magically, it all comes together and turns <br/>
out great.  I doubt any play &quot;practice&quot; is organized and calm..<br/>
