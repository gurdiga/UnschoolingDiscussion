  &gt; Did most of you register your homes as private schools so that you <br/>
  &gt; wouldn&#39;t have to deal with school boards? <br/>
  &gt; <br/>

  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  No, because according to the Oklahoma Constitution and state <br/>
  statutes, the school board only has the authority to regulate public <br/>
  schools.  They have absolutely no authority to even come and <br/>
  check to see if my kids are truant or not.  It&#39;s one thing I love about <br/>
  this state.<br/>
