I also remind myself that we don&#39;t have the problems with things like cockroaches that they have in warmer climates.  I have a little bug phobia though so others might not care.<br/>

  And we don&#39;t have to check our shoes before we put them on.  I had a girlfriend from Australia that though Canada was Heavenly because she could put her shoes on and not worry about what had crawled in them and fill a bubble bath and not worry about what had slipped in under the bubbles if she had to leave the room.  eek!  She had lived in one of those houses that have no hallways just one continuous patio around the house and not all the doors had screens on them.  It was wonderful she said but she was very squeamish so the crawling &#39;things&#39; really bothered her.<br/>

The Sydney Funnelweb is pretty much the world&#39;s most venomous spider. It is<br/>
large, aggressive and lives in nature in rocky crevices. Unfortunately for<br/>
humans, the urban landscape is full of cement and brick crevices. I learnt<br/>
as a child never to go outside without shoes, because they could be living<br/>
under the back stairs. A related South Coast spider lives in holes in the<br/>
lawn, and is a danger to people and pets. According to Irwin, Australia also<br/>
has 9 of the 10 most venomous snakes. Also the world&#39;s only poisonous<br/>
octopus. Even the male platypus has venomous claws on it&#39;s back ankles,<br/>
although it is timid and wary of people. Sydney is also infested with horrid<br/>
cockroaches (an imported species) and many of the older terraced house homes<br/>
have w.c.&#39;s that are partly detached or open to the outside, and separate<br/>
from the bathroom - which contains shower, bath and sink indoors. Makes for<br/>
unpleasant nighttime trips. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089266523">Thanks Robyn... every time I start to get homesick for Australia I think of all those nasties, I recall the day that Rhianon picked up a live cone shell in a rock pool and how my second oldest son had a pet Blue Ring Octopus and red back spiders in jars...<br/>
