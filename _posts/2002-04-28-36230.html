<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398329842">&lt;&lt;Maybe it&#39;s an oversimplification, but sometimes I think unschooling is not<br/>
all that different from school-y stuff, just in its pace and timing.  Any<br/>
thoughts?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the content so much as the method.  When school is good, it&#39;s about <br/>
the real world!<br/>
<br/>
When school is bad, it&#39;s repetitive over and over again (understandably for <br/>
the assembly line, but each kid sits through most explanations year after <br/>
year).  When school is bad, it involves age-expectations, and labels of <br/>
&quot;ahead,&quot; &quot;behind&quot; (in fancier terms often, with federal funding involved), <br/>
&quot;differently abled&quot;....  I could go on, but I&#39;m not going to.<br/>
<br/>
Another difference between school and unschooling, as to content, is they <br/>
called a small sliver of the world &#39;all,&#39; and we call all of a life&#39;s <br/>
learning &#39;some.&quot;  While professionals are afraid unschoolers will fail to <br/>
cover &quot;all&quot; the material, we KNOW the best of their students 1) learned most <br/>
of what they know outside of school;<br/>
2) only were &#39;taught&#39; the small packets of information the texbook publishers <br/>
designed to fit into semesters, units, weeks, lessons;<br/>
3) will forget most of what they regurgitate on the short-term-memory <br/>
exercises known as &quot;tests&quot;;<br/>
4) will consider themselves finished learning at high school graduation,  <br/>
unless they go to college (in which case see above).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The lego people farmed for weeks (closest thing to a diarama likely to<br/>
happen here!).  My son drew pictures of farms (during church, but hey!).<br/>
But I never sat him down to do those things, he just did them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of my fondest memories is of putting out a creche scene one Christmas (a <br/>
Christian home-diarama) of Italian design and manufacture, about 5&quot; high on <br/>
the adults, and made of hard plastic, like from the 1950&#39;s or 1960&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I saw it for what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty saw it as what it was from their point of view:  &quot;Jesus <br/>
action figures&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One day I came in and there were two Ninja Turtles adoring Jesus, while a <br/>
king and a shepherd had gone off to help vanquish Splinter and the Foot Clan.<br/>

I&#39;m glad that came quoted back.  <br/>
<br/>
SHREDDER and the Foot Clan.  <br/>
<br/>
Splinter&#39;s a good guy!  <br/>
<br/>
So sorry. If Kirby were reading this he would be so ashamed of me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
