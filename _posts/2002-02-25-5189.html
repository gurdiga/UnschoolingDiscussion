people who were successful before we all became so civilized.  Knuckle<br/>
dragging  cave dwelling mommys and daddies would have thought they had<br/>
pretty sorry offspring if all they did was sit and draw on cave walls.  (<br/>
ok, there were at least a couple of those) <br/>

ADD and ADHD haven&#39;t been proven to be real medical conditions, only a<br/>
set of behaviors that adults find difficult to cope with in children. <br/>
It&#39;s really too bad that kids don&#39;t get to medicate the adults in their<br/>
lives who have difficult behaviors.  <br/>
Now that would be some kind of fun! <br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s Karate teacher says he had trouble in school and I can believe<br/>
it.  The guy can&#39;t hold still for a moment.  He works two jobs and<br/>
teaches six classes a week.  On Monday and Wednesday he teaches two hours<br/>
of karate and tae kwon do followed by an hour of kick boxing.  He runs<br/>
races, he plays ball, he can&#39;t stop. <br/>
So the difference here is everybody loves this guy!  Hey, he&#39;s dedicated,<br/>
motivated,  a real go getter!   No one looks at hyper active kids that<br/>
way.  With kids it&#39;s always a problem.  <br/>
<br/>
We have friends with medicated kids and they tried to get us to do the<br/>
check list for ADHD when Dylan was four.  We told them &quot;NO THANKS!&quot; <br/>
Whatever Dylan is is just fine with us.  When we look at him we see<br/>
perfection.  What&#39;s the difference?  Why do some parents look and see a<br/>
problem?   Clearly they did not take enough drugs in their early<br/>
years.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For the most part, I agree with you.  But I know a boy who came home crying <br/>
after being sent home yet again from the neighbour&#39;s for bad behavior.  He <br/>
told his mother that he really didn&#39;t want to act that way.  He just <br/>
couldn&#39;t help it.  He is one kid who has done really well since being <br/>
medicated.  But I don&#39;t believe there are very many like him.<br/>
