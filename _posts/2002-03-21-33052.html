<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280361096">-=-[Unschooling-dotcom] was  Andrea Yates now SANDRA-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s now how the list needs to be.  I&#39;m not the topic. The subject <br/>
matter is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Maybe we should NOT make blanket statements about others that we have no <br/>
REAL intimate knowledge of. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the statement didn&#39;t apply to you, then it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up Baptist.<br/>
I&#39;ve probably read more of the Christian homeschooling literature than most <br/>
Christian homeschoolers have read.  What would &quot;intimate knowledge&quot; look like?<br/>
<br/>
If you yourself are unaware that there are dowels for sale in certain sizes <br/>
for certain ages, then you&#39;re objecting to my statement without sufficient <br/>
knowledge to discuss it.  But the publisher of one large homeschooling <br/>
magazine recommends wooden spoons instead.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t think I was making this stuff up, did you?<br/>
<br/>
And all in all, were you defending Andrea Yates?<br/>
Attacking me?<br/>
<br/>
I hope neither.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re going to buy one aimed at the Christian Homeschooling Community, <br/>
you might get that one or worse!!<br/>
<br/>
If you get Home Education Magazine, you will NOT get articles on corporal <br/>
punishment.<br/>

I *think* someone mentioned they were having problems fulfilling their<br/>

Any affiliation with Ezzo, Fulgate, Perls should set off alarm bells. As<br/>
should HSLDA. <br/>
