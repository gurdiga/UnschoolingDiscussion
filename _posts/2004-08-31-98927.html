<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249370054">*** You could also  use something like &quot;DragonTree Center for Cooperative<br/>
Learning,&quot; but the  word &quot;center&quot; might be confusing to folks who are<br/>
expecting you to have a...well...center.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get other ideas,<br/>
but maybe these ideas  will help get other ideas that will work well for<br/>
you.***<br/>
<br/>
What about Dragon Tree Learning Circle? I had a look in my thesaurus and<br/>
circle came up along with group, association and society. I like circle best<br/>
though. Lots of great, unschooly thoughts spring to mind.<br/>
