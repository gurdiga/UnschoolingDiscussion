 </span></blockquote>We smile sweetly and say something like &quot;we home school, so school is where <br/>
ever we go&quot;.  Or simply &quot;we homeschool&quot;.   It depends on how chatty I&#39;m <br/>
feeling that day.  Now that ds is 12, he fields this question himself.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never got an openly hostile response.  Often startled, but not hostile.  FWIW <br/>
every doctor, optometrist, dentist, etc., has asked kids how they like school <br/>
or some other opening line that gives kid a chance to say he homeschools.  I <br/>
get the most open support from these professionals.  More than one has made a <br/>
statement something like &#39;I wish more families would do that&#39;.  Every one has <br/>
made supportive statements.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids generally start on some sort of beading, latch hooking, crochet or <br/>
embroidery project when they are 5 or 6.  That&#39;s usually when they start <br/>
asking to do what I&#39;m doing.  I like that these are projects that they can <br/>
accomplish and that the implements aren&#39;t sharp.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think pioneers were pretty hard on their kids, having the girls <br/>
start embroidering when they were only 5 or 6.  Now I get it!  Those girls <br/>
would have been pestering their mommas for something to do anyway, so they <br/>
might as well start practicing a skill they would need.<br/>
<br/>
One of these days I&#39;m going to learn to spin and weave.  I have wanted to do <br/>
that for 30 years, now.  Homeschool is a great excuse to explore this with ds.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, think of all the math and physics lessons that can be picked up from <br/>
manipulation of fabric and craft materials.    I count every hour crafting as <br/>
part of our school time.  Not that I actually keep track, but if anyone <br/>
shooed ever give me a hard time about it, it&#39;s there to use.<br/>
