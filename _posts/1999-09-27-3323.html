designed to tape you, and if you leave a message on it, you are aware that<br/>
you are being recorded for later playback.  As such, would it not exceed<br/>
the reasonable expectation of privacy and fall under public domain?<br/>

record a phone conversation.  That would be sneaky.  But what you said sounds <br/>
reasonable.<br/>

     This is what I thought!  Thank you for agreeing with me.  Of course, <br/>
that may not make it right, as we aren&#39;t exactly attorneys  :)       I can&#39;t <br/>
help but feel that there is truth to your observation however.<br/>
