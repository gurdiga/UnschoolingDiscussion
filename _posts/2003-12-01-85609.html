<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841780556">I just mentioned to the kids that it was their cousin&#39;s birthday today.<br/>
Jacob wanted to call him straight away (9:30am) to say happy birthday and to<br/>
ask if he received the bionicle we sent to him. I reminded him that Brodie<br/>
would be at school but we would call him this evening. Jess looked at me in<br/>
horror and said, &quot;He HAS to go to SCHOOL on his BIRTHDAY?!!! How rude!!!&quot;<br/>
and then they all sat down happily to watch their favourite parts of the<br/>
Hulk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never had to go to school on my birthday.  I was so upset when I found out<br/>
that people had to work on their birthday.  I agree that it&#39;s rude.<br/>
