<br/>
It is normal for young children to prefer a sweet liquid, but ideally<br/>
this would be breastmilk for the first 2 or 3 years :-)  I would also be<br/>
concerned about her teeth, with a constant flow of juice-water on them.<br/>
<br/>
It would probably be better for her to have her juice non-diluted and<br/>
limited to one or two servings (2-4oz per serving) per day, then drink<br/>
plain water in between.  Juice is certainly not a required food either! <br/>
But when she is only with you some of the time, there may not be much you<br/>
can do about it.  Maybe try a baby bottle with plain water, if this may<br/>
also be a comfort thing for her.<br/>

Yeah, I can see how extended breastfeeding wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a plus in<br/>
the fertility department after a while. I just hope that *someday* we&#39;ll be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917114890">Pippa is clearly on the way to weaning - I bet in the next 6-12 months or<br/>
so. She&#39;s 4yo and nurses on average 1-3 times every 24 hours or so, but it&#39;s<br/>
very irregular these days. Have you all seen Katherine Dettwyler&#39;s site? She<br/>
has a great essay on the natural age of weaning (she concludes it is<br/>
somewhere between 2.5-7yo):<br/>

_Our Babies, Ourselves_ by Meredith Small is a wonderful book that also<br/>
discusses normal behavior for human babies vs. cultural expectations. Both<br/>
women are anthropologists. I give the Small book to every pregnant woman I<br/>
know. It&#39;s not a dictatorial &quot;you must parent this way&quot; kind of work, but it<br/>
is highly informative, especially about things like the importance of touch<br/>
and frequency and duration of breastfeeding.<br/>

As for fertility, have you read Toni Weschler&#39;s book &quot;Taking Charge of Your<br/>
Fertility : The Definitive Guide to Natural Birth Control and Pregnancy<br/>
Achievement&quot;?? It&#39;s really great and informative about understanding your<br/>
body and how to become pregnant or avoid it! One little tip that I got from<br/>
somewhere is that if you want to be more fertile, I might help to sleep with<br/>
a light on. Somehow this influences your body to keep your estrogen levels<br/>
higher (the darkness signals your body to drop them for the night). It&#39;s not<br/>
something you want to do long-term, sleeping with a light on has been<br/>
associated with higher rates of breast cancer and other estrogen-related<br/>
cancers, for the same reasons.<br/>
