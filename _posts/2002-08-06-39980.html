&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning *how* to find the answer to a question.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I learned this lesson the hard way this week. My ds (5 next month) is <br/>
&gt; currently obsessed with dinosaurs and asked me to explain the difference <br/>
&gt; between a coelophysis and a corythosauras and did I know what a <br/>
&gt; rhamphorhynchus was? No, I sure didn&#39;t know but we got out his dinosaur <br/>
&gt; books <br/>
&gt; and looked it up. I definitely know less about dinosaurs than he does so I <br/>
&gt; just need to learn how to help him find his answers and provide resources <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>

Marine Biology Field experience. We went out to lunch and he described the <br/>
research and experiements they did, all of which were totally beyond me.  He <br/>
described the graphs they made, etc. which demonstrated math skills that he&#39;s <br/>
clearly learned by osmosis (which he also knew and found useful this past <br/>
week), since he&#39;s done virtually NO structured math since he left school <br/>
after the third grade.<br/>
<br/>
He enthusiastically talked about all this stuff throughout lunch, and I <br/>
finally looked at him and said &quot;You are just so SMART!&quot;  He giggled and <br/>
smiled.  THEN he paid for our lunch using his brand-new debit card, figuring <br/>
out how much tip to leave.<br/>
<br/>
My point is...not only do we not have to have all the answers, we can&#39;t and <br/>
SHOULDN&#39;T. Takes a lot of the fun out of learning if we can answer all the <br/>
questions. AND it&#39;s important for the kid to have areas where they are the <br/>
smarter ones.<br/>
