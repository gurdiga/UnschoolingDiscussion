I keep meaning to ask you if you have gotten the &quot;Sweet Balance&quot; stuff.  Does <br/>
it effect you like sugar?  How does it taste?  I have cut way back on sugar <br/>
and trying to pick up on protein, and I am feeling a little better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,  Yes, I got the Sweet Balance, and it is great!  (wish it weren&#39;t <br/>
so expensive, though).  I have used it in lemonade, shakes, spaghetti sauce, <br/>
and pies.  You really would not know there was no sugar in them, because it <br/>
tastes so good.  I have not been able to use it successfully in cakes, <br/>
because you use so much less of it than sugar, so the chemistry is off.  (The <br/>
taste is good, texture isn&#39;t light)     But, pies turn out beautifully, and I <br/>
am going to make cookies with it soon, so we&#39;ll see how it does. :)  Did you <br/>
find you have low blood sugar?  If you need any recipes, I&#39;ll be glad to <br/>
share with you what I have if you would like some.  :)  Just give me a <br/>
&quot;holler&quot;!  ~Karen</div>

of a leaf is enough for a glass of tea-straight up it tasted like candy. It <br/>
was really good.<br/>
