  Yes, I have congenital hip dysplasia.  The strange thing is that I never <br/>
had pain until a few months before I conceived my first son!  I started <br/>
having moderate pain at that point, but it went away as soon as I became <br/>
pregnant.  I think the relaxing of my joints and the hormones makes the pain <br/>
go away, because the same thing happened during my second pregnancy.  <br/>
Anyway, five months after the birth of my first son (the traumatic birth) I <br/>
was in so much pain that I couldn&#39;t lay on that side and it hurt when I did <br/>
very much walking, moving around etc.  I was in tears often.  I saw several <br/>
physical therapists and it didn&#39;t help one bit.  Yes, it still pops out of <br/>
place from time to time, but visiting my chiro helps immensely.  She has the <br/>
hip moved enough that it seldom pops out of place and I am no longer in <br/>
pain.  It did take over a year to get to that point though!  It might go <br/>
quicker for a young child, I don&#39;t know.  It just takes awhile to get the <br/>
muscles used to the idea of having the bone in a new spot (the correct <br/>
spot!).  My chiropractor told me from the start that she couldn&#39;t promise me <br/>
that I wouldn&#39;t need a hip replacement, but she would do everything possible <br/>
to help!  And she has!  So, look for a chiropractor that you feel will be <br/>
upfront with you and explain everything that she/he is doing.  She has kept <br/>
our whole family very health!  Good luck!<br/>

I just had say I loved your story and my son&#39;s name is Colton too!  I had <br/>
never heard the name before he was born!  He will be one on Easter!  I <br/>
treasure each moment that I get to hold my babies.<br/>
