I checked out the podcast but it is only the first hour of the three  <br/>
hour show.  Does anybody know a way to listen to the Sandra portion  <br/>
of the show?  I&#39;d even pay for it.<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, please.  It wasn&#39;t worth paying for.  Let it slide through  <br/>
like mud in the river.  (That makes more sense where I live than in  <br/>
places where rivers are perpetually  muddy, so maybe never mind  <br/>
unless you&#39;re from mountain states.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a nice thought, but it was a brief series of interruptions with  <br/>
me recommending that people might want to read about it at  <br/>
SandraDodd.com  (which seems to have had 300 or 400 extra hits  <br/>
yesterday, too).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m hopeful that people listening were intrigued enough to visit your site.<br/>
I was alternately joyed in listening (first time I&#39;ve heard your voice!) and<br/>
frustrated by how little interest the show had in thoughtful, intelligent<br/>
discussion. It seemed to me the other guest was brought on to play the<br/>
controversy card rather than to provide balance. Not surprisingly, her<br/>
comments weren&#39;t cut short. The host had the terribly annoying habit of<br/>
asking several questions, pausing briefly to allow you to begin talking, and<br/>
then immediately interrupting. (I find this style of &quot;dialogue&quot; distasteful<br/>
even when I don&#39;t have a personal interest in the topic.)<br/>
<br/>
I appreciated the opportunity to hear you speaking live, but I agree, it was<br/>
not the best format - at least not for people who could benefit from hearing<br/>
you speak in full sentences. You weren&#39;t given reasonable time to respond to<br/>
either of them of before getting cut off. It&#39;s a good thing your web address<br/>
is short and easy to say!<br/>
<br/>
The host was dismissive of callers who expressed agreement with unschooling<br/>
and I was surprised that your segment ended so quickly (and abruptly - the<br/>
show came back from a break and he just said a quick &quot;thanks to our guests&quot;<br/>
- no opportunity for last thoughts or anything). I listened for a while<br/>
afterwards, thinking maybe there would be more callers or that he&#39;d have<br/>
further comments, but heard nothing.<br/>

That was the best part. &lt;g&gt;  It was an intro to the existence of the  <br/>
information, and that won&#39;t hurt anyone.<br/>

<br/>
There are a couple of places to hear my voice without the cranky  <br/>
frustration it might&#39;ve had the other night.<br/>

<br/>
I talk fast, but not as fast as it sounds on the radio interview.   <br/>
They seem to have compressed it, or at least edited space between  <br/>
phrases.  It sounds like I never need to breathe, but they put the  <br/>
best parts of a long phone conversation into a short breathless  <br/>
interview.<br/>
