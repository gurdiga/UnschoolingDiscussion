<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816634191">Yes, the more I think about it....its probably the kids who are *looking* for something missing in their lives, that get into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would be the ones to innocently &quot;fall into&quot; something, but once they found themselves in a bad situation, they&#39;d probably do what they could to get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I just worry that they might get in over their heads and not realize it before its too late.<br/>
