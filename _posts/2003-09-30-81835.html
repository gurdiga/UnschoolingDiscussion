because people feel that labelling gay  families as sinful is loving doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they are. I&#39;m a religious educator professionally and can argue Bible with <br/>
the best of them, but there&#39;s no point. <br/>

MY experience is that there&#39;s a huge difference in the philosophies of the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363927004">I was hoping that someone could help with this. A little background....<br/>
<br/>
Jason and I have always wanted to travel, it was one of the major factors in our decission to keep the kids home, we put it off when Jaiden(5) was first born, we flew a bit and took a few short, 8hrs or so, road trips when he was 2-3. We had Avery and waited a few months before flying again, no road trips longer than 4 hours. Avery is 2 now, and we have been with out a car and income for most of 2 years so traveling as a way or life has again, been put on the back burner.<br/>
<br/>
We fly to Michigan a few times a year to visit my dad, they pay for the trips. We are planning to spend x-mas with them this year. I talked to my dad a few days ago and he asked if we&#39;d be interested in driving out. We live in San Diego and they are outside of Detroit. They would pay for the whole trip. We are totally excited. <br/>
<br/>
My mom however, keeps bring up all the bad points to the road trip idea. The long hours a day in the car, the fact that it&#39;ll take 3-5 days, she&#39;s driving me nuts! But she may have a few valid points....<br/>
<br/>
So I was hoping that someone might have some ideas on how to entertain a 2 year old and a 5 year old on a trip across country. We will be renting a car, Jason will be doing all of the driving, since I don&#39;t drive and it&#39;ll be during the winter, so playing in parks to get out pent up energy will be hard.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a bad idea? It will work right? I hate to pass up on a great opertunity just because my mom is putting doubts in my head, on how horrible it will be. <br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s been a while since I had to entertain kids that age.  &lt;g&gt;  As far as<br/>
pent up energy goes, Most McPukes have an indoor playground these days.<br/>
That&#39;s where I always stopped when Lars was littler.  Other than that,<br/>
researching interesting stops along the way to break up the trip would be<br/>
good.  I don&#39;t think it matters so much how many days you&#39;d be travelling.<br/>
The important thing is how many hours at a time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used to do a lot of road trips when Fisher was in that age range, and it <br/>
was always great.  During the winter, we ate at fast food restaurants with play <br/>
places (McDonald&#39;s PlayLand) whenever we could, or at least found a mall or a <br/>
Walmart that we could walk around in, play hiding games among the clothes <br/>
racks (Fisher had to be quiet because he was *hiding* &lt;g&gt;), and get a small toy <br/>
for the next leg of the trip.  We drove more in the afternoon (nap time) and <br/>
after bedtime -- at the dinner stop we&#39;d just put him in PJs and go until we <br/>
were tired or until we reached a motel with an indoor pool.  Driving at night <br/>
would give us the leeway to take it easy in the morning -- swim, watch Barney on <br/>
the room TV while having breakfast in bed (we usually brought cereal and milk <br/>
with us, or got the free continental breakfast).  And we&#39;d just keep our eyes <br/>
open for signs about attractions that might be do-able with the young&#39;un.  <br/>
That&#39;s what I love, the spontaneity, the different rhythm of life on the road.<br/>
<br/>
In the car (assuming it has a tape player), things like books on tape for <br/>
kids worked great (some, like Barney and Disney Babies and Winnie the Pooh, were <br/>
available at WalMart &lt;g&gt;), as did kids&#39; music tapes, books, small cars, <br/>
crayons and paper, a Magna-Doodle or Etch-a-Sketch, driving bingo (you can make the <br/>
cards yourself and have them mark when they see a stop sign, a fire truck, a <br/>
blue license plate -- whatever is appropriate), toy dinosaurs or animals -- <br/>
things they can play on their lap.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of for now -- hope that helps!<br/>

When Kirby was three we drove from Albuquerque to San Francisco.<br/>
First, there aren&#39;t many stops through there.  We learned that just any side <br/>
of the road was fun for him.  We picked up aluminum cans while he looked at <br/>
flowers and bugs and rocks and ran and sang. <br/>
<br/>
It worked.<br/>
<br/>
But with TWO kids...<br/>
<br/>
We started making car tapes.  I&#39;d make a tape of the funny and interesting <br/>
songs I knew they were liking, and we&#39;d use those tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, sometimes for a car trip we&#39;ll get out some years-old car-trip <br/>
tape.  Holly&#39;s just lately discovered a few things that were on the old Radio Aahs <br/>
tapes, and Raffi.<br/>

#############################<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of staples we have available for our kids in the car for long, <br/>
short, and everyday errand trips.<br/>
<br/>
In many catalogues there are these cool things that strap to the back of the <br/>
front seats to store toys, books, etc. for kids. We improved on that idea and <br/>
use two backpacks. Inside there is a bottle of water or juice, zip lock <br/>
baggies of cookies/graham crackers, grapes, apples, trail mix (you get the picture). <br/>
Books, travel games, etch-a-sketch, personal tape or CD players with tapes <br/>
and CD&#39;s. Paper and crayons, and erasable markers, and a wash cloth. We put <br/>
erasable markers in so the kids can draw on the windows. My kids use the markers <br/>
to play hangman, keep score on the alphabet game, license tag game, and other <br/>
car games. They draw pictures and write messages for other drivers too! ;o) <br/>
Each kid gets a window and the markers can be erased. Both kids have a pillow, we <br/>
stop every two to three hours. We also, for long trips, put a small cooler in <br/>
the back, and fill it with whatever the kids choose, usually sandwiches, <br/>
cheese and such that they can eat whenever. <br/>
<br/>
In the past year or so I have included a map of where ever we are going, and <br/>
a list of any things that might interest the kids along the way so they can <br/>
keep their eyes out for it. I map our trips out carefully and use Google to look <br/>
for things to see and do along the way. We also keep our eyes out for <br/>
interesting signs along the highway. We stop for things like, worlds largest ball of <br/>
string, drive through zoos, the garden of eden (some guy had himself buried in <br/>
a see through coffin in the middle of his garden), craft shows, town days (we <br/>
have gone to parades in towns we have never been to, we see signs that say <br/>
*Smithville Harvest Festival Weekend* and turn off and go!) only once was it a <br/>
waste of time to stop. Some towns have a unique heritage and when they are <br/>
having an all town festival there is usually ethnic costumes, music, food, and <br/>
crafts. So if you have the time and see a sign advertising a towns Polish, <br/>
Swedish, German/days, and it is going on right then, then stop and go! Have a <br/>
Kielbasa, sample some Lutefisk, enjoy a good beer! Let the kids run around for an <br/>
hour or three. <br/>
<br/>
My advice would be to keep things easy going. Stop often, be prepared for <br/>
emergencies... Take along a couple of zip lock baggies with wet wash cloths, have <br/>
a towel or two on hand, make sure your emergency kit still has Band-Aids and <br/>
some antibiotic creme in it, put a flash light with an extra set of batteries <br/>
in the trunk, and a few plastic grocery bags.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71524318">We have taken Jayn on several car trips. I have to say it was easier<br/>
when she was younger (2) because she would sleep so much more in the<br/>
car. We stop very close to every two hours - she was totally entranced<br/>
by the sprinklers on at a rest stop one time. She has a box of favorite<br/>
toys with her, and now we will usually give her a brand new toy at the<br/>
start of the trip to engross her. It often helps her to play happily if<br/>
I sit with her in the back - although that makes me car sick after a<br/>
while. Nor can I read to her for the same reason. However if you can<br/>
rent a large enough vehicle that you can spend part of the time sitting<br/>
between them in the back that may be a good thing. This last trip was<br/>
made fun by the magnet white board that we won at the conference raffle.<br/>
I have already had to buy new markers for it. She also has favorite<br/>
music, which requires patience on the part of my husband.<br/>

longer is better, or at least allowing longer even if you don&#39;t use all<br/>
the time up. That way if a really cool museum shows up en route, you<br/>
won&#39;t feel rushed about looking it over. I think you are very brave to<br/>
drive in what may be snow. Before we go anywhere my husband does huge<br/>
internet searches about places on the road, and even downloads maps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139747409">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Last summer we drove to Texas and back from Maryland - kids age 12, 8, <br/>
3. We had a blast -- kind of old by day 3 on the way back, but we&#39;re <br/>
going again next summer.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some things that work --<br/>
* the kids&#39; favorite is goodie bags. I make up little goodie bags - <br/>
toys, treats, etc. with stuff they each like - matchbox cars, polly <br/>
pockets, little wild animals, card games - whatever little stuff they <br/>
like. And I pack up all this goodie bags, and give them a few each day. <br/>
We use the map --- ex. when they see the &quot;welcome to tennessee&quot; or <br/>
something like that, and they get a goodie bag. I figure it out so that <br/>
they get one every few hours. It really helped a lot, and I had some for <br/>
the way back also. I use the kind of little bags that kids get at <br/>
birthday parties. I use three different themes, so I don&#39;t get the bags <br/>
mixed up. (the kind of stuff a 12 yo girl likes is not the same as a 3 <br/>
yo boy. :-)<br/>
* we keep coolers w/ drinks and snacks in the car, accessible to the kids<br/>
* we have a small tv in the car - one of those little ones that&#39;s a <br/>
tv/vcr and plugs into the cig. lighter (designed for camping) and it <br/>
will take two headphone sets. This was great too.<br/>
* we plan places to stop on the way there, and we took one route down <br/>
and another back. We also get going early, so the kids sleep the first <br/>
couple of hours, and then when they wake up, they have breakfast in the <br/>
car -- that alone takes up three hours or so.<br/>
* portable cd players and books on tape are good too. lots of kids like <br/>
video games.<br/>

&gt; My mom however, keeps bring up all the bad points to the road trip <br/>
&gt; idea. The long hours a day in the car, the fact that it&#39;ll take 3-5 <br/>
&gt; days, she&#39;s driving me nuts! But she may have a few valid points....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I was hoping that someone might have some ideas on how to entertain <br/>
&gt; a 2 year old and a 5 year old on a trip across country. We will be <br/>
&gt; renting a car, Jason will be doing all of the driving, since I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; drive and it&#39;ll be during the winter, so playing in parks to get out <br/>
&gt; pent up energy will be hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this a bad idea? It will work right? I hate to pass up on a great <br/>
&gt; opertunity just because my mom is putting doubts in my head, on how <br/>
&gt; horrible it will be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TIA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451905026">I have to jump into this discussion.  We take many long car trips with our <br/>
children.  Our first really long one was five weeks of travel from our home in <br/>
KY out to SF CA and back going the northerly route.  At that time my kids were <br/>
15mos. 4,5,6, 8, and 10 years old and we took the 14yo daughter of a friend <br/>
with us.  We travel in a large 15 passenger van and pull a converted W.W.II army <br/>
Jeep trailer behind us with all of our camping gear in it.  We tent camp as <br/>
we go.<br/>
<br/>
These trips took a lot of research on my part, I found the AAA to be a great <br/>
resource for starting the process with their tour books and campbooks and <br/>
maps.  I then explored further afield from there.<br/>
<br/>
We would drive pretty intensely for a day, as in get in 12-18 hours of <br/>
driving and then set up camp and stay for anywhere from 2-5 days depending on our <br/>
interest in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids did just fine, even the ones who get car sick and the ones who are <br/>
more energetic than not.  We had lots of car games, lots of tapes from songs to <br/>
soothing to story, and lots of snacks.  We stopped every couple of hours and <br/>
spent at least 20 mins running around, sometimes we spent longer at the rest <br/>
stops depending on how interesting they were.<br/>
<br/>
Our last big road trip was over 9,000 miles and took 7 weeks.  My kids at <br/>
that time were 7, 10,11,12,14 and 16 respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my kids like to travel, others tolerate the time in the car in order <br/>
to enjoy where we are going, but all of them have learned over the years how <br/>
to cope with long stretches of sitting in one place.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I love these trips as it is a chance to truly just be family <br/>
without any of the distractions of jobs, activities, etc.  It was through these <br/>
trips that I actually got the courage to see homeschooling as a viable <br/>
alternative.  How we lived on the road felt so right and it was obvious the kids <br/>
were involved in exploring what they were interested in.  Sometimes it was very <br/>
humbling to me to realize that noone else had any interest in a stop that I had <br/>
flagged as fascinating.<br/>
  Some of the things we did for in car entertainment were hand held games, <br/>
paper and all sorts of marking instruments, individual CD players so each person <br/>
can listen to their own music when they needed to.  We had group games, the <br/>
standard, licensee plate games, counting cows, etc.  Each child got to purchase <br/>
something new to play with for the car before the trip.  Each child had their <br/>
own bag of stuff and was expected to keep track of their own stuff.  We had <br/>
lots of snacks available although we limited the drinks a little after stopping <br/>
five times in one hour for various people&#39;s bladders &lt;VBG&gt;.  Audio books on <br/>
tape are great for all ages, we used the Harry Potter books on tape as the main <br/>
way to use up time on a long two day push from the Badlands of South Dakota <br/>
back to Kentucky and everyone was absorbed in the stories for hours.  As a <br/>
matter of fact we got flack about stopping for rest areas because they didn&#39;t want <br/>
to interrupt their listening!<br/>
   We gave out maps and compasses, binoculars, guide books, etc.  Everyone <br/>
had a say in where to stop or whether to stop for an attraction.  It can be lots <br/>
of fun.  My kids are starting to agitate for when are we going to travel <br/>
again.  <br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to give it a shot.  We have always had fun on the road.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864006369">We bought an Audiovox tv w/vhs player that plugs right into the <br/>
cigarette lighter.  It even has headphone jacks and you can plug in <br/>
gaming toys.  I&#39;ve seen them at Target on sale for $150.  We use it <br/>
often and have used it in the house (has an AC adapter too) when the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351649293">I don&#39;t think it is a bad idea.  While I haven&#39;t driven that far, we recently drove from western PA to New England (2 days of driving each way) with kids DD(5) and DS (11 mos) and it was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Play in the cold or snow! Just keep the cold weather clothes handy in the car, not packed away in teh bottom of the suitcase.  Or  stop at places (like McDonalds) with indoor playspaces.  But any rest area usually has enough space for the kids to do some inside running around.  But even in the cold, kids can run around outside for a <br/>
<br/>
Here are some car activities that we do on long trips. My advice is mostly pitched at the 5yo, I don&#39;t remember tips for a 2 yo.   We try to stop about every 3 hours (that is the &quot;itchy&quot; point for our kids, YMMV).   For our 2 day drive I planned 2-3 &quot;things&quot; to have for each 1/2 day of driving and kept them in a separate bag until their time arrived, so to speak, so that I could introduce new things as we went and not have everything be played with for 2 seconds in the first hour of the trip.  <br/>
<br/>
I also took a lot of snacks and juice boxes and pop-top small bottles of water.  If I lost one bottle in the care somewhere, I just got another one, rather than having to search. <br/>
<br/>
Some things we do:  <br/>
<br/>
A laptop computer (if you have one/can borrow one) My 5  year old and I watch DVDs and play computer games in the car.  Or I guess a car version of a VCR. <br/>
<br/>
Books on tape.<br/>
<br/>
Books to look at if you kids aren&#39;t prone to car sickness. <br/>
<br/>
Geoboards and rubber bands (we keep one of these in the car, actually, it is good for short trips, also!). <br/>
<br/>
Magnets sets (you can make them out of any characters you wish by using self-stick magnetic sheets from Micheal&#39;s to back cut-outs from whatever source). Play them on a baking sheet. <br/>
<br/>
Felt sets -- you can also make these out of any characters that you like.  Trace the character onto freezer paper, iron the freezer paper onto the felt, and you have an easy way to cut out the characters.  Or just use shapes, but my 5 yo lkes charecters from books she is currently enjoying.  If you take a piece of felt the size of the baking sheet and put magnets in the corners, you can play it on the same baking sheet as used for the magnet board.  If you just want to use paper-cut outs on a feltboard, glue small squares of sandpaper to the back of the paper-cut out. <br/>
<br/>
Playdough -- use the same baking sheet for a playing space.  Assume that you will throw the playdough away at the end of the trip and vacuum out the car.  Add-ins for the playdough - feathers, googly-eyes, popsicle sticks, large sequins, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Sticker sets (you can also make these yourself of whatever characters you can print on the computer by buying sticker paper from the office supply store).  Or you can buy sticker books pretty cheaply.  DD loves the dress-up dolls ones and the ones for Strawberry Shortcake. <br/>
<br/>
Pipecleaners and/or twist ties for making sculptures, flowers, people, houses, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Aluminum foil for making scuptures. <br/>
<br/>
Make scotch tape designs on the bake side windows.  My 5yo invented this and it is currently her favorite.  <br/>
<br/>
Buy a bag of odd cheap toys from a local thrift and pull them out from time to time during the trip. Novelty helps. <br/>
<br/>
Colorform sets.  I think you can play these on the back side window as well as the board, but I haven&#39;t tried it yet. <br/>
<br/>
Travel versions of games (we love the Travel Version of &quot;Guess Who?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Art supplies in general (we always have colored pencils, markers, scissors, glue stick, paper, etc. in one of those back-of-the-seat organizers in our car).  When DD was younger, we also kept a magnadoodle in the car.  No worry about loosing the pen, running out of paper, etc.  A write-on/wipe-off board with a low-fume pen attached by a string is another similar option.  I sometimes tell stories and draw them as I go along (a la Harold and the Purple Crayon). <br/>
<br/>
One I just read about, but haven&#39;t done yet.  Make pictures with different lengths of colored yarn on a square of sandpaper.  I&#39;ll cut the sandpaper square to fit our ever-present baking sheet.  You can also put felt on sandpaper and it sticks better than to a felt-board.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So I was hoping that someone might have some ideas on how to entertain a 2 year old and a 5 year old on a trip across country.  <br/>

<br/>
I understand the legality (and the money and politics behind it).<br/>
<br/>
If people REALLY cared about child safety, it would be illegal to drive <br/>
children anywhere they didn&#39;t absolutely have to go, and surely illegal for them to <br/>
ride on school busses without seat belts.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s legal in a school bus.  And unschooling isn&#39;t going to work very <br/>
well if we keep our children inside with padded walls wearing helmets all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know I&#39;ll get flak but seatbelts laws are not in my personal top ten <br/>
laws to follow when a kid is going to be in a vehicle for ten or twelve hours <br/>
at a stretch.<br/>
<br/>
This group doesn&#39;t need to come to concensus about it, certainly.<br/>
I just want to chime in with the point of view of someone who&#39;s 50 and has <br/>
been out of seatbelts more than in in those years and would hate to have missed <br/>
some of the (few) things I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have seen lots more already than I&#39;ve seen.  It wasn&#39;t safe to go in <br/>
those airplanes and on those long drives, but we risked danger so they could <br/>
have experiences.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a trade-off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935560571">We&#39;ve had a two different RVs.  One was an early 80&#39;s model and the other was 2001 model.  Both had seatbelts at every seat.  Many of the sofas fold out into beds and the seatbelts get pushed down underneath while it&#39;s out as a bed.  Just reach through and pull them out.  The table should have seatbelts as well.  On both of ours the furniture was bolted to the floor and the seatbelts were attached to the frame of the RV.  That said I have also seen an RV where some of the chairs were NOT attached and did not have seatbelts.  (Seating like this should not be used while the RV is being driven.)  It just depends on the manufacturer.<br/>
