 </span></blockquote>Well, unfortunately I felt the need to move 9 hours away from my parents on<br/>
purpose.  When the opportunity arose, I jumped on it.  I also have  no<br/>
desire to go visit their house any time in the near future.  Since we moved<br/>
in March, they have already been out to visit us once, for a weekend.  That<br/>
is about all that I can handle of them, one weekend in MY house, MY rules.<br/>
They are much easier for me, and DH, to handle that way.  I make sure that<br/>
my kids know who they are, talk to them on the phone and have a positive<br/>
image of them and relationship with them.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now I am using my energy to work on stability and growth in our<br/>
immediate family.  I do not have the energy or desire left right now to<br/>
work on the relationship with my parents.  It is always very one sided, and<br/>
I cannot forgive their past behavior when they continue it every time I<br/>
see/talk to them.  I know that they are not going to change, and I am not<br/>
willing to accept their abuse.  Even my DH does not like to spend time with<br/>
them, although they are usually nice to him.  He does not enjoy watching<br/>
them torture me.  He will often ask my dad, after he has goaded me into<br/>
getting really upset (ONCE AGAIN) &quot;Why do you do that to her??&quot;  Of course<br/>
he knows the reasons.  It&#39;s a power trip for him.  But that doesn&#39;t make it<br/>
hurt less or be less upsetting.<br/>
<br/>
For us, the distance is a blessing.  It enables us to maintain (mostly)<br/>
peaceful relations, if sparing in frequency.  It enables the boys to<br/>
maintain a positive image of their grandparents while they are little.  It<br/>
does not allow my parents to interfere with my child rearing, degrade my<br/>
self esteem, judge me, emotionally abuse my children in the same ways they<br/>
did me, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my inlaws are completely another story.  They are coming for a long<br/>
weekend in mid Oct. and we can all hardly wait.  They are very affectionate<br/>
grandparents and very down-to-earth people.  We would really enjoy seeing<br/>
more of them in our lives, but they live near my parents.  <br/>

It sounds like we have similar parents!  Mine were here last week<br/>
for a visit.  My father and I got into it and they ended their<br/>
trip 2 days early.  I am a 4.5 day drive from them (4 or so hours<br/>
by plane) and I like it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Like you I am focusing on my children, husband and myself.  I can<br/>
do nothing to help them change -- that must come from within<br/>
themselves!  Your comment about your father&#39;s power trip opened<br/>
my eyes to why my father does that type of thing -- thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings!  I have really enjoyed hearing about your Pagan beliefs.<br/>
My Samhain will be very different this year -- I&#39;m more Buddhist<br/>
than any other belief but I&#39;m being drawn more and more to Pagan<br/>
celebrations.<br/>
