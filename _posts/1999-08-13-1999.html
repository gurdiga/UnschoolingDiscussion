<br/>
Our family spent 3 years in Germany where it is illegal to home ed so our<br/>
dd had to spend 3 years (Gr 1-3) in a school. Going into Gr 1 I knew that<br/>
her small motor skills were weak and knew that she did know how to print,<br/>
but that it was quite messy. They zoomed through printing and then went on<br/>
to script, because in that enviroment beautiful handwriting with a fountain<br/>
pen was what they aimed for. Of course she was thrown for a loop and her<br/>
script was very messy (which the teacher told her again and again). <br/>
<br/>
When we got back to Canada and were finally able to home ed again I told<br/>
her to forget all about script and print for as long as she wanted to. She<br/>
printed for about a year and then said she was ready to learn to write. She<br/>
already had the skills so when she took off on handwriting it turned out to<br/>
be quite beautiful (her own style combining German italic-style with some<br/>
Canadian style letters.)<br/>
However, when she has to write now (Gr 10) she is still much more<br/>
comfortable with printing.<br/>
