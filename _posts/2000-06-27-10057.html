&gt; Due to camaraderie and interest expressed by several people on the<br/>
&gt; Unschooling.com list I have decided to form an e-loop letter (which<br/>
&gt; could become an e-list) list for hs parents who are challenged<br/>
&gt; themselves by diseases such as MS, Lupus, Fybromyalgia and any other<br/>
&gt; form of physically limiting disease or disability (wheel chair bound,<br/>
&gt; dealing with cancer, kidney disease etc).<br/>
&gt; The reason for this being that only someone in an identical or similar<br/>
&gt; situation will have any idea of the trial and tribulations that become<br/>
&gt; part of our daily lives and affect our hs&#39;ing life as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This loop will be a safe place to vent, moan, seek comfort and express<br/>
&gt; our joys, fears and the triumphs we make over our various obstacles and<br/>
&gt; stumbling blocks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This loop will not be moderated but anything hateful or mean spirited<br/>
&gt; will be not be tolerated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nothing will be off topic as everything colours our lives and influences<br/>
&gt; how we homeschool/unschool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please pass this on to anyone in the homeschooling/unschooling community<br/>
&gt; you think may benefit from such a venue and have them e-mail me<br/>
&gt; personally if they wish to be included.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope to have it up and running by the middle of July.<br/>
