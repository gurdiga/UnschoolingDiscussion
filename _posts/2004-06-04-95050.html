There  have been a couple of times on my local list that I have  accidentally<br/>
written a reply that would be fine on this list - because I  have not checked<br/>
the subject line carefully enough.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
That&#39;s happened to me too! I&#39;m thinking, &quot;What in the WORLD??&quot; and then  <br/>
write this *very* unschooly comeback.<br/>
It&#39;s happened enough that I always check which list before I hit send!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
