I posted about the math power book and did see that it was out of <br/>
print :( but I think it can be bought used from Amazon.com<br/>
<br/>
I love your page !! I couldn&#39;t get the link that you first posted <br/>
but the second one worked great - Thanks !! <br/>
<br/>
I have not tried anything on it as of yet but I can&#39;t wait.<br/>
I got this game @ Taget for the kids it&#39;s called <br/>
&quot;COUNT DOWN&quot; the first to flip over all 10 keys wins the game :)<br/>
Depending on the roll of the dice - take the math challange you can <br/>
add - subtract - divide - multiply to get your results.  I can&#39;t <br/>
wait to play it.  I thought it could be adjusted to whatever level <br/>
your child is at.<br/>
<br/>
My son did a math problem the other day in the carriage @ the store.<br/>
He said I know what 4 and 4 is ! He said it three times before he <br/>
told me his answer because he kept forgetting what he figured <br/>
LOL..... anyway he finally did tell me the correct answer. When I <br/>
asked him how he knew he said I guessed it mom.  He always tells me <br/>
that even when we play games. I know he doesn&#39;t guess them but he <br/>
won&#39;t tell me what his secret is LOL....... When people ask us about <br/>
home school he always proudly states &quot;I teach myself - my mom <br/>
doesn&#39;t teach me&quot; I get such a kick out of him. He does like to <br/>
figure out things himself though ! I&#39;m glad to have the math power <br/>
book because like reading I didn&#39;t want to mess up his own way of <br/>
figuring out how he was processing the information.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! I saw a game just like this at my local big box book store (Chapters up here in Canada). It looked wonderfull but it was $20 and I am waaaaay too cheap. So I read the rules on the back and made the game at home with a few stray die and some cards. I do the same thing with the Rainbow Resources catalogues and such. I scan for good ideas and steal them shamelessly. :)<br/>
