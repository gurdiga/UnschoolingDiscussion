<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059399308">Hey Shelly, We emailed back and forth about Gaia&#39;s children&#39;s group about a month ago!  Did you know you are not required to do this portfolio review in CT?  School boards will try to tell you that but it&#39;s not accurate.  You can contact CHEA to be reassured.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Merry Meet to all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   My name is Shelly and I live in Connecticut with my husband, 4 kids, 2<br/>
&gt; dogs, 1 cat a frog and a fish. I am 29 years old and am expecting baby #5<br/>
&gt; mid November.Our kids are 10,7,6, & 4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   We had decided to homeschool back in 1990 but family really gave us a hard<br/>
&gt; time so we tried public and then private schools before pulling our kids out<br/>
&gt; in March&#39;98. We had planned to let the kids finish the year while we <br/>
&gt; investigate how we wanted to homeschool them but a knife brought to my <br/>
&gt; daughters class and threats made us pull our children out on the spot from<br/>
&gt; the Catholic school they were in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I finished their year doing what they wanted to do and having fun building<br/>
&gt; terriums and exploring the woods when we went on hikes. In the fall we began<br/>
&gt; to use Oak meadow curriculum and I have to admit I struggled to try and get<br/>
&gt; everything done in a week. Some weeks we did others we didnt. Mid way there<br/>
&gt; the year I decieded we could pick and choose what we wanted to do and things<br/>
&gt; have gone easier for all of us. I dont plan on using a curriculum next year<br/>
&gt; and am just looking for good reading books and maybe some math books to use.<br/>
&gt; I am required to do a portfolio rewiew at the end of the year and must have<br/>
&gt; some examples of required subjects that were taught. I like the idea of<br/>
&gt; unschooling and really want to do it but I am honestly not sure how to meet<br/>
&gt; the school boards needs and do unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I am currently reading John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; and am looking<br/>
&gt; to do some more reading on the subject of unschooling this summer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think my main problem is not comparing my kids. I never have compared<br/>
&gt; them with other kids outside our home but I worry about my 2 middle ones. My<br/>
&gt; oldest Brittney who is 10 learned to read on her own at 5. She just loves<br/>
&gt; books! It is her favorite way to spend her time and always has been. her<br/>
&gt; Brother Nathan who is 7 likes to read but struggles. I do think this is left<br/>
&gt; over from school as he hates to write and is constantly worrying about <br/>
&gt; mispelling a word. Chelsea who is 6 is just starting to show she wants to<br/>
&gt; read and is trying. I guess I worry what is the right age and do worry they<br/>
&gt; will be embarrassed if they go to a function where other kids their age are<br/>
&gt; already reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think that is my only concern is about math and reading. We do so many<br/>
&gt; other things to learn science and social studies that I know my kids are<br/>
&gt; thrieving. I suppose in time I will learn to trust.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well I have rambled on her. I look forward to learning from everyone on<br/>
&gt; the list!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blessings,<br/>
&gt; Shelly<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hail from Connecticut as well! :) I have to agree that unschooling should<br/>
&gt; be no problem in Connecticut. I have unschooling friends in Connecticut and<br/>
&gt; they haven&#39;t been bothered at all to my knowledge. Lucky for me, I have<br/>
&gt; &quot;proof that I&#39;m smart&quot;, hehe. I got my diploma through a correspondence<br/>
&gt; course under a private high school. However, keeping a portfolio seems like<br/>
&gt; a good idea. But don&#39;t worry, CT is pretty lenient about home/unschooling!<br/>

Shelly,<br/>
          I live in Ohio and my biggest concern was finding a certified <br/>
teacher who would do a &quot;portfolio assessment&quot;. I found one on the internet <br/>
who unschools her children. Is there a Homeschooling List that you can join <br/>
in your state? I&#39;ll bet that someone knows of someone in your area that can <br/>
do the portfolio review that is &quot;unschooling-friendly&quot;. I know it&#39;s a pain, <br/>
but try to write down something everday that the children are doing. Cooking <br/>
becomes &quot;reading, math and science&quot;. Shopping becomes &quot;consumer math&quot;. T.V. <br/>
shows fit into various subjects. &quot;Bill Nye-The Science Guy&quot; is science. <br/>
&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; is social studies. Taking care of pets becomes &quot;science&quot;. <br/>
Games can be counted too. Monopoly is reading and math. &quot;Boggle&quot; is reading <br/>
and writing. &quot;Yahtzee&quot; is math. Also, a trip to a petshop is a science <br/>
fieldtrip. There is lots more. I count EVERYTHING. Last night I let my 8 y.o. <br/>
pump gas into my car. I&#39;m counting it as &quot;science&quot;.(I think of everything as <br/>
science--LOL). When you find someone to do your portfolio review, let us <br/>
know. I&#39;ll be thinking of you. I know what it&#39;s like.<br/>
