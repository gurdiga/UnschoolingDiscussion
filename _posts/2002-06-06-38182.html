<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425409813">My father-in-law will be celebrating his 80th b-day in October. His <br/>
wife who is like a blood grandma to the kids is putting on a great <br/>
big celebration at a hotel near their home, about 1 1/2 hours from <br/>
our home.  Although  they got room rates of $150 per night, we are <br/>
expected to pay for our own room. Our kids, their grandkids, are not <br/>
invited to the party, and if there is drinking, which I&#39;m SURE there <br/>
will be, I would prefer them not to be there anyways.  This is the <br/>
kicker, Grandpa wants to introduce each of his kids (at least they <br/>
ones he still communicates with that will be there) and grandchildren <br/>
and then send the grandkids and great grandkids off to their rooms!  <br/>
This means they would not eat with everyone and have to eat in the <br/>
hotel room.  Not that room service would be bad, but I think it is <br/>
really rude!!  My children are not trophies to show off and then <br/>
pushed away.  Money is not an issue for the grandparents, as they are <br/>
VERY well off! I told my hubby that if our kids aren&#39;t invited to eat <br/>
with everyone, then I will also leave and stay with the kids, maybe <br/>
go out with them to grab a bite to eat or something. If there is an <br/>
issue with them not wanting young children making noise, then for <br/>
goodness sake, have an adult party withought the &quot;parade.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grandpa did offer to pay for our room when we told him we could not <br/>
afford one. Am I being a real pain in the butt?  Maybe I take offense <br/>
too easily in regards to our children. Or maybe my reasoning is <br/>
skewed because I know so much family history that&#39;s taken place over <br/>
the many years. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any opinions.<br/>

<br/>
Let them pay for the room. <br/>
Let them send kids away.  Use it as a lesson to the kids about how some <br/>
people feel about kids, so they&#39;ll appreciate how you are with them!  <br/>
<br/>
Being where people aren&#39;t as liberal and child-focussed might be a real <br/>
eye-opener for them that will last them the rest of their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Holly is appalled when she sees people treating kids like totally inferior <br/>
beings.  It will color the kind of parent and adult she will be!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563332119">I agree with Sandra, let them pay, speak with your kids about how you feel<br/>
about it and keep in mind that the KIDS may have an even better time<br/>
upstairs with all their cousins and no parents! Hire a babysitter to keep an<br/>
eye and split it amoung the parents. (Or get the hosts to offer)<br/>

mention that the kids feel like they&#39;re being hauled all the way out there,<br/>
displayed like trophies for a few minutes and then put in a box for the<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re well off, maybe that will prompt them to think of -- or you could<br/>
suggest ;-) -- at the very least a separate room for the kids to be able to<br/>
gather in, perhaps at the hotel pool? I don&#39;t know what the age range is so<br/>
perhaps that isn&#39;t workable and might need too many adults, but if they<br/>
can&#39;t stay at the adult party, perhaps they could think of something else to<br/>
get all the cousins together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi laura, <br/>
<br/>
I went through a similar experience.  When I was told that my <br/>
children could not stay for more than an hour, I first felt it was <br/>
rude.  When I thought about it more I realized it was toward the <br/>
history I have with my m-in-law.  At this party there was much <br/>
drinking and adult language, I personally would not want my children <br/>
around.  In the long run she did me a favor(One freebie on her side <br/>
lol).  I did end up getting a babysitter and the kids had a blast.  <br/>
I did explain to my 7 year-old son, that there was going to be many <br/>
adults and they would be talking about adult matters.  In the long <br/>
run they would of been bored. There would of been many &quot;Don&#39;t do <br/>
this , Don&#39;t do that&quot; and who knows what else.  Those statements <br/>
seem to bother me the most.  <br/>
