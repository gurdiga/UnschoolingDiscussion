I used to work with an older man and the two of us interviewed new employees <br/>
together.  He was a slow-moving, methodical, ex-military, <br/>
Knights-of-Columbus, <br/>
lawn-mowing guy.  I was a zippy hippy.  We liked each other, but we didn&#39;t <br/>
interview together so well.   He used to say (slowly) if you take the time to <br/>
do <br/>
a thing right the first time, you won&#39;t have to do it twice.  A couple of <br/>
times I said right after him, &quot;But if you do it fast enough you&#39;ll have time <br/>
to <br/>
do it twice, and if you did it right the first time you can do something <br/>
else!&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Ben and me. Ben&#39;s so s-l-o-w and methodical and linear. I&#39;m a <br/>
bit...um.....fast-and-hectic-and-all-over-the-place. Overall, we balance each other out. I <br/>
exhaust him; he keeps me twiddling my thumbs more often than not. Sometimes I <br/>
wonder why I ever did this to myself!&lt;G&gt; But over-all it&#39;s good. He just needs <br/>
to speed up! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
