&lt;&lt; We watched part of Searching for Bobby Fisher last weekend. Only part, cos <br/>
the video from the store was of really poor quality - made viewing difficult. <br/>
But my 7 yo was so inspired by what we saw - the boy in the film is, I guess, <br/>
a chess prodigy. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Josh Waitzkin is the boys name.  We used to have one of the chess notation <br/>
books he wrote, can&#39;t seem to find it though. You might check his book/s out, <br/>
that would probably excite your son. It had a picture of him on the back and <br/>
a short bio, he&#39;s all grown up now!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
