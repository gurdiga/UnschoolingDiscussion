I have been trying to think of this word ever since Will and I bought  _Enter <br/>
the Matrix_ for PS2 last Wednesday.  It&#39;s not a word I&#39;ve used much  since <br/>
the early &#39;80s.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s strange how things are coincidental like that.  Thanks for using  it.  <br/>
Now I can turn off that back burner that was simmering a little too  high for <br/>
comfort.<br/>
