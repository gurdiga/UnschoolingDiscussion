<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743457655">I actually don&#39;t think I am too surprised that boys do better as unschoolers as opposed to &quot;school at home&quot; because studies (I don&#39;t have any specifics) show that schools are set up for girls to succeed in their general learning styles and not boys. I know this isn&#39;t true for everyone, but maybe it is generally true. Maybe more boys are kinesthetic learners.  <br/>
<br/>
Lori, how is your son doing? Is he starting to show specific interests yet? My daughter does, but my son really hasn&#39;t yet. Maybe because I am still in the habit of looking for &quot;school interests&quot;. I think he is just having a good time being his own boss. When he was in school (K-2), he used to be so happy to be able to come home and do his own thing. The only thing is that it was always shortly bedtime to him, because he had to get up the next day, and he didn&#39;t have enough of &quot;his time&quot; that he needed. He would tire of things like Boy Scouts because he would get into doing his own thing at home and it was time to leave again. He really enjoys just being home. I think he would probably be called an introvert whereas his sister is definitely an extrovert.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670455616">HI Karin & Lori, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group & I know they advise just to read for a week or <br/>
too but I just had to reply. My daughter (13) can sit & read a books <br/>
for hours & is not really bothered if she ever goes too far. On the <br/>
other hand my son (12) has to be active the whole time & he HAS to <br/>
run or walk the fields (we have 39 acres here in WV) at least once a <br/>
day. He loves the outdoor life & will only read what he wants to. <br/>
But, you know what, he is a very balanced kid - just has energy that <br/>
needs burning. He is card crazy & whenever we are all free, he wants <br/>
to play. Be encouraged, at least you&#39;re giving them the opportunity <br/>
to be themselves.<br/>
<br/>
See ya,<br/>
<br/>
Liz<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I have been amazed at how &quot;active&quot; this site is. Everyone here <br/>
is laughing at the number of emails I&#39;m getting each day!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One day last Fall I was working. I groom dogs and I was expecting another <br/>
long day of being alone in the &quot;salon&quot; with a bunch of poodles. I was in the <br/>
middle of roughing out the first one and said to myself, &quot;Well, I guess I <br/>
won&#39;t be learning anything new today. It&#39;s just more of the same ol&#39;, same <br/>
ol&#39;.&quot; I had NPR on (I can&#39;t carry a tune or read music---but I love hearing <br/>
it! &lt;BG&gt;), and the guy was talking about a conductor who had just retired. He <br/>
told about how he gave his last performance and how the orchestra remained <br/>
seated as he took a bow. This was the ultimate show of respect and honor and <br/>
deference that an orchestra can give to a conductor.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER knew that! It really touched me to learn it. And I got to hear the <br/>
final performance and hear the applause he received---all by his lonesome.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s got to be very emotional to retire from someting you love so <br/>
much---and then to be honored in such a way.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t figure out WHAT a conductor really DOES! &lt;G&gt; I figure that if <br/>
everyone KNOWS his part, that this guy just HAS to be superfluous! &lt;BWG&gt; But <br/>
I enjoy watching him.<br/>
<br/>
But here on a day when I thought I would learn NOTHING new, I DID! &lt;G&gt; And it <br/>
was really neat. I &quot;failed&quot;! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

orchestras will play without a conductor. (There may even be a word for it.)<br/>
So probably if you looked up some discussions about why they try that<br/>
sometimes it would be clearer why they do use a conductor most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
But I *think* it has to do with keeping everyone on the same tempo. (Or do I<br/>
mean beat? Or is that the same thing?) Just knowing all the notes isn&#39;t the<br/>
same as 50 or 100 people being able keep the exact same tempo throughout it.<br/>
It could be also that sitting in the orchestra things sound different than<br/>
they do to the audience. So maybe there&#39;s some unconscious tendency to drift<br/>
into making things sound right from where you&#39;re sitting rather than sound<br/>
right from where the audience is sitting.<br/>

<br/>
And I&#39;ve heard the Orpheus MANY times on NPR--they have just never said that <br/>
it&#39;s conductorless! I wish they would--although THEN it would probably be <br/>
seen as a slap in the face of the many conductors who are so revered, so <br/>
maybe they shouldn&#39;t, considering their audience.  Like having Sandra Dodd <br/>
speak at a curriculum fair! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Ok, y&#39;all---many of you musicians: How do y&#39;all feel about this--especially <br/>
as UNschoolers? Do you prefer conductors? Can they make a difference to you? <br/>
Or does it feel like meddling in what YOU know?<br/>

I&#39;ve played violin and piano in orchestra settings and the place where I have felt the conductor very necessary is with bringing it all together.  Obviously&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Such as with dynamics,  loudness and softness.     Someone hearing the whole thing, together.  When you are playing your instrument its pretty hard to hear the parts and if you are at the right levels,  volume wise,  or if others are loud or not.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s where I think they are needed.        Although maybe if they are there in rehearsal,  they wouldn&#39;t be needed so much in the performance.   I think it also has  alot to do with how many are in the orchestra/band.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s players thoughts on having a conductor, no conductor. Conductors&#39;s<br/>
&gt; responses. What audiences think. And examples of effective musical<br/>
&gt; leadership.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really neat---to read what some musicians thought about conductors---many of <br/>
them think the same way I do! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s a piece on The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, &quot;widely considered to be<br/>
&gt; one of the world&#39;s great orchestras&quot;. (Even nonmusical me has heard of <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Conductorless Orchestra.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HAH! I beat you there! I can also google! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve heard the Orpheus MANY times on NPR--they have just never said that <br/>
it&#39;s conductorless! I wish they would--although THEN it would probably be <br/>
seen as a slap in the face of the many conductors who are so revered, so <br/>
maybe they shouldn&#39;t, considering their audience.  Like having Sandra Dodd <br/>
speak at a curriculum fair! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The founder had &quot;the goal of bringing the chamber music ideals of democracy,<br/>
&gt; personal involvement, and mutual respect into an orchestral setting.&quot; Lots<br/>
&gt; of good stuff about the bad parts of having a conductor. But it *is* only <br/>
&gt; 27<br/>
&gt; people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Twenty-seven with others in & out. But it WORKS! And so it&#39;s not about beat <br/>
and/or tempo---or where you&#39;re sitting. It&#39;s about CONTROL! And authority.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, y&#39;all---many of you musicians: How do y&#39;all feel about this--especially <br/>
as UNschoolers? Do you prefer conductors? Can they make a difference to you? <br/>
Or does it feel like meddling in what YOU know?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve pretty well hit it right on the nose, Joyce.  The bigger the group of<br/>
musicians, the harder it is to keep it together and balanced.  I&#39;m playing a<br/>
couple of concerts this weekend with a very small orchestra.  Actually we&#39;re<br/>
playing one piece for 8 woodwinds.  That one won&#39;t be conducted, but if you<br/>
were watching carefully, one of the players would be making exaggerated<br/>
movements with his instrument to indicate tempos, etc.  Another piece we&#39;re<br/>
playing is for 2 horns, 2 oboes, and strings.  I *think* that our conductor<br/>
will be conducting that one from the concertmaster&#39;s spot (first violin),<br/>
again with the exaggerated movements of his bow.  The other piece is a<br/>
violin concerto.  He&#39;s been conducting that, and I *think* he will for the<br/>
concert, but I&#39;ll find that out at the dress rehearsal tonight.<br/>
<br/>
As to power-tripping conductors . . . I&#39;ve had a few.  They fit the old joke<br/>
about what&#39;s the difference between a conductor and a bull?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The orchestra has the horns at the back and the a**h*le at the front.<br/>

Each time things slow down, speed up, or change speeds abruptly, the <br/>
conductor has to set that pace.<br/>
<br/>
In small ensembles the change is accomplished, again, by following that <br/>
leader.  Or the person/player who comes in at the new temp sets the tempo and <br/>
others follow that change.<br/>

<br/>
I prefer ensemble music without a conductor, but if I were in a large enough <br/>
ensemble/orchestra/band I would want one.  It&#39;s a matter of scale.<br/>
<br/>
When I lead vocal groups, which I used to do much more, I like songs with <br/>
obvious leaders, so that no matter how many &quot;backup singers&quot; there might be, <br/>
there is a person to follow.  If the lead singer of that song decides the <br/>
audience is bored and wants to bail to the last verse, and if the last verse <br/>
has a special kind of ending (a repeat or hold or extra harmonies) the leader <br/>
can indicate that by eye contact or a gesture to the one or two people who <br/>
can make the difference.<br/>
<br/>
When we start songs up, if possible we get one singer or one instrument to do <br/>
the first line, or a lead-in line and then we have the pitch and the tempo, <br/>
with no counting or humming a tone or hand-waving.   It&#39;s still control and <br/>
authority, but it&#39;s not the formal baton-waving.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or does it feel like meddling in what YOU know?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m part of a group playing music in the style someone else decided, I&#39;m <br/>
part of THEIR musical moment.  When I&#39;m deciding how a piece is going to be, <br/>
I rarely have anyone saying &quot;That&#39;s too fast,&quot; or &quot;I really want to use a ton <br/>
of vibrato here even though it&#39;s an early Renaissance piece.&quot;  If you make <br/>
your point for good reasons and you explain them, and get the cooperation of <br/>
your other people, it&#39;s not meddling, it&#39;s cooperation.   <br/>
<br/>
When other people are willing to go in with me on my vision of something, I&#39;m <br/>
willing to do something their style if they want.  <br/>
<br/>
But as with many pursuits, there are way more followers and &quot;whatever&quot; guys <br/>
than there are visionary leaders with strong opinions.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t picture all of us staying together without our drum majors, especially when<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  We just had a taste of this at rehearsal tonight.  The<br/>
&quot;leader&quot; of our octet actually asked the conductor if he would conduct the<br/>
piece because we were having trouble staying together.  (mainly one of the<br/>
bassoons, who couldn&#39;t keep up and hasn&#39;t learned to just leave out notes<br/>
here and there in order to stay in time)  Anyway, the conductor refused.  It<br/>
will be fine.  He was also asked to conduct one of the string pieces and<br/>
refused.  It really did sound better with him playing first violin.  It&#39;s<br/>
just a little harder for them to follow</div>

personal take on it.  <br/>
<br/>
But after watching The Actors&#39; Studio, I hear many different ideas on that. I <br/>
guess it depends on the actor. When asked what kind of director he likes, the <br/>
actor will generally fall into one of two categories. Either he wants a <br/>
director with an exact vision of what he wants---who can verbalize exactly <br/>
what he sees in his head. Or he likes a director who is &quot;hands off&quot; and <br/>
allows him the freedom to &quot;become&quot; that character the ACTOR sees in HIS head. <br/>
Ben and I try to guess which one they&#39;ll be (or ARE, in the case of <br/>
directors).<br/>

it. But how would a conductor know? (his back&#39;s to the crowd) Or can he even <br/>
DO that? Classical music pretty much is &quot;standard&quot;---folks know every note. <br/>
Deviations could drive an audience mad. Maybe in just the choral productions?<br/>

REALLY don&#39;t care! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on the situation. I&#39;ve sung with a big choir and <br/>
pretty complex music (Mozart&#39;s Coronation Mass) that definitely <br/>
benefited from having a conductor. A good conductor can teach you <br/>
things you don&#39;t know about the music, the language it&#39;s written in, <br/>
etc. as well as holding you all together on a sometimes difficult <br/>
beat or set of tempo changes. But I&#39;ve been in other, smaller, groups <br/>
where it&#39;s not so important. I think it depends a lot on what you <br/>
want to get out of the experience as well. I don&#39;t ever mind teachers <br/>
if I&#39;ve sought them out for their knowledge and they know something I <br/>
don&#39;t and I would like to learn it.<br/>

<br/>
Somebody still has to have the vision of the whole play or movie, to know <br/>
who&#39;s in when and where they&#39;re standing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Can you really DO that &quot;cold turkey&quot;? Or does it have to be discussed in <br/>
advance, so that the musicians/singers know it&#39;s a possibility? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can do it cold turkey if the musicians are smart and flexible and <br/>
experienced.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But how would a conductor know? (his back&#39;s to the crowd) Or can he even <br/>
DO that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I was talking about smaller groups, without conductors.<br/>
<br/>
With orchestras they just end up leaving out whole numbers, or doing just <br/>
last movements if the crowd is starting to be lost (like for kids&#39; concerts, <br/>
when they make an excuse and end sooner than scheduled sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe in just the choral productions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about &quot;choral productions&quot; the way you&#39;re thinking of it <br/>
either.  Not a director and 120 voices doing Bach.   Twenty voices doing <br/>
Somerset Wassail, or Riu Riu Chiu, where the final verse&#39;s text is going to <br/>
be immediately recognizeable to the singers, and the soloist going to that <br/>
text is the clue that this is the last verse.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I guess that&#39;s the thing---individual vs team mentality.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, some things can&#39;t be done without a group.  No individual can put on an <br/>
opera.  Not even a skit.<br/>
