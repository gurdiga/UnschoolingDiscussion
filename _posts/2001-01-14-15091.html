<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557761772">I get them from Crafty Cutter in Paso Robles, CA. I&#39;ll<br/>
look for their number for you. They sell die cuts and<br/>
calenders for scrapbooking and if you tell them you&#39;re<br/>
a consultant (Creative Memories or other), you get a<br/>
50% discount on everything without ever having to show<br/>
proof of your business. <br/>
If you prefer not to fib, they&#39;re $6 instead of 3.<br/>
