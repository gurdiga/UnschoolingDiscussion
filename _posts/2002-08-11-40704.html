&gt; complete, total unschooler who lives in PA?  At the end of the year, <br/>
&gt; you have to hand in a portfolio with samples of the student&#39;s work, <br/>
&gt; along with a letter from a qualified evaluator stating that progress <br/>
&gt; has been made.  <br/>

before moving to TX 6 months ago.  TX is soooo easy.  But I did the paperwork <br/>
in MA and it was inconvenient but doable.  I didn&#39;t do samples or testing <br/>
though.    <br/>
<br/>
If I were in PA, I would get an evaluator who understands unschooling.  Mary <br/>
Hood (author of The Relaxed Home School) knows and recommends one.  I could <br/>
get you her name if you want.   If I couldn&#39;t get around the samples then I <br/>
guess I&#39;d ask them to do a smaple in September and again in June.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also work at changing the laws but probably move out of PA first.<br/>

&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>
