King&#39;s X from the Math Monster<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
-&quot;What about times tables?&quot;-<br/>
<br/>
The fascination some parents have with the magical power of knowing times <br/>
tables amazes me each time I hear that question.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped counting up around the fiftieth time.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do your kids do times tables?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;do&quot; mean in relation to a table?  Discover it?  Too late.  Write <br/>
one out?  This &quot;table&quot; of which they speak is a block of data, a pattern of <br/>
numbers, involving relationship and function.  What&#39;s to do?  It&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
My kids can &quot;do it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What my kids can&#39;t do is to answer speed quizzes like &quot;What is six times <br/>
nine?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, they can calculate 6% (local sales tax) and 30% (the discount <br/>
Kirby gets on gaming supplies) in their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Once a much younger Kirby wanted to walk to the corner store for a Dr Pepper. <br/>
 he asked what he could do to earn money.  I whipped up a blank table with <br/>
1-9 across and 1-9 down, showed him what the multiplicatory deal was, and said <br/>
I&#39;d give him a penny a square.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How much money will that be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Same as the answer in this square,&quot; and I indicated the 9x9 square.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was only four or five, but he wanted in on this money-making puzzle, so <br/>
I made him one too.<br/>
<br/>
They helped each other, filled theirs in, figured who was right when there <br/>
were discrepancies, LOVED finding the patterns, and nearly forgot about the <br/>
sodas.<br/>
<br/>
When they got back from the store (with change, as it hadn&#39;t occurred to them <br/>
to stop when they had reached the price of the soda), they were still excited <br/>
about that chart.<br/>
<br/>
We had a big new concrete patio, and one night the whole family and some <br/>
friends were playing outside.  When a spinning, jump-roping, free-for-all game got <br/>
old and they were tired, I chalked out a chart about 8 feet square, and the <br/>
kids started filling in the easy parts—2&#39;s, 5&#39;s… soon there were only six or <br/>
seven squares left, like 7x8 and other intuition-avoiding combos.<br/>
<br/>
I have never before or since seen such total –doing- of times tables.<br/>
<br/>
Jody Hegener once told me a tale of having been challenged by kids from a <br/>
Waldorf school who waited until they had an eleven or twelve year old Jody headed <br/>
out on horseback at a ranch with them to ask the big question:  &quot;Do you know <br/>
your times tables?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jody told them she didn&#39;t know if she did or not, since she didn&#39;t know what <br/>
&quot;times tables&quot; meant.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, they had her good.  But they told her what it was that she knew so <br/>
little about, and they demonstrated, zipping on up to the times TWELVE they knew <br/>
(way better than the nine or ten limit of public schools).<br/>
<br/>
So Jody was up with them and getting the pattern on the elevens and twelves, <br/>
and said &quot;What about 13?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t have to know 13.  It wasn&#39;t so fun anymore. Jody told me she was <br/>
multiplying by 14 when they finally got her to stop.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine she was thinking of how very easy fifteens would be.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;times fifteen&quot; won&#39;t be on the test.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This summer Kirby was overheard explaining to some other teens at the gaming <br/>
shop how to multiply by 18.  Do it by 20, and subtract two for each one you <br/>
have.  No pencil, no paper, and the school-labeled &quot;learning disadvantaged&quot; <br/>
friend totally understood.  <br/>
<br/>
The adults who overheard this expressed amazement.<br/>
<br/>
The other homeschoolers who heard about it were amazed that adults had been <br/>
amazed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps knowing the times tables, &quot;doing&quot; the times tables, is a magic safety <br/>
from further math trauma.  &quot;I know my times tables&quot; is like &quot;King&#39;s X&quot; from <br/>
being tagged by the math monster.  My kids think math is a tool and a toy and a <br/>
game.  Why would they want to be saved from it?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t have to know that&quot; isn&#39;t anything I have ever heard my children <br/>
say.  Because there is nothing they –do- &quot;have to learn,&quot; there is nothing that <br/>
is off their learning list either.  In artistic terms, without the object there <br/>
is no field.  In math-lingo, they have the infinite universal set.  In a <br/>
philosophical light, they avoid the dualism of learning and not-learning.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are new to math in the wild, I have some recommendations of things <br/>
that worked well for us.  First, don&#39;t be teacherly about any of this.  Don&#39;t use <br/>
the talking-to-a-poodle voice (and if you don&#39;t have one or don&#39;t know what <br/>
I&#39;m talking about, GOOD!).  Then, gradually gather some subset of this sort of <br/>
math stuff, plus other things it might remind you of:  <br/>
<br/>
- two or more matching geoboards and colored rubber bands (you could get just <br/>
one, but then you can&#39;t copy each other&#39;s designs)<br/>
<br/>
- pattern blocks, even if your kids are older (we have the wooden ones with <br/>
the yellow hexagons being the biggest), because there are angles to mess and <br/>
because it&#39;s very soothing<br/>
<br/>
- Cuisenaire rods if you can get them for less than full price (or if you&#39;re <br/>
rich), but don&#39;t worry about the &quot;real&quot; exercises<br/>
<br/>
- Yahtzee, Bazaar, Master Mind for Kids(cuter, friendlier, simpler version <br/>
than adult Master Mind), playing cards, poker chips (not necessarily for playing <br/>
poker, just for messing around with, making patterns), and Clue (Kirby says <br/>
there is a new D&D Clue game out.  We have the Simpsons version.)<br/>
<br/>
- real money to spend<br/>
<br/>
- computer and video games like  Zoombinis, KidPix, Harvest Moon, Mario, Link <br/>
& Zelda<br/>
<br/>
- don&#39;t discourage Magic, Pokemon or other &quot;CCG&#39;s&quot; (collectible card games); <br/>
D&D and other dice games involve much math and strategy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other day in my kitchen I said, &quot;Hey, Kirby, I might make $100 for an <br/>
article on you teaching someone to multiply by 18, and you didn&#39;t even know I <br/>
overheard you talking about it, so I&#39;ll give you $10.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cool.  10%.  I&#39;m like an agent or something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His 23-yr-old first-time visitor got big eyes and said, &quot;You were teaching <br/>
someone to multiply by 18?!&quot;</div>
