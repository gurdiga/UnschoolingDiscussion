<div id="ygrps-yiv-685381022">Hi Sheri.....This has been such a tough week for us all.  My DH has a friend<br/>
missing.....was in WTC....this makes our brokenheartedness .....I don&#39;t<br/>
know, deeper....I know most Americans are brokenhearted,  but it seems<br/>
different if you have been touched more personally.  I imagine most of us<br/>
are a bit snappier with our children this past week,  I know I am.  But I&#39;m<br/>
also deeply grateful for moments of love and even laughter we can experience<br/>
through our innocent little ones.<br/>
  I feel I&#39;m beginning to ramble now....let me focus on what I wanted to<br/>
say:  Please be patient with yourself - growing can involve &#39;pains&#39; and<br/>
while you may become more whole,  you&#39;ll not become inhuman - you&#39;ll still<br/>
have strong emotions,  positive and negative.<br/>
  Your mention of  your home and how it&#39;s state of messiness bothers you  -<br/>
makes you feel badly.  I&#39;ll refer you to the FLYlady (www.flylady.net).  I<br/>
am a recovering slob.  I have lived with CHAOS most of my life.  This site,<br/>
this program has been a godsend for me.  Hope you&#39;ll check it out.....let me<br/>
know what you think!<br/>

] current events<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I must admit that I too haven&#39;t really read most of the posts from<br/>
yesterday<br/>
  and today. I skimmed past most, they seemed far too petty in light of<br/>
recent<br/>
  events. One friend of the family dead and two others on the missing list.<br/>
My<br/>
  mom is heart broken, they are her friends. Darren her husband is a retired<br/>
  big wig in the Air Force.  So many family and friends in the military...I<br/>
  haven&#39;t heard from my dear friend who lives in Manhatten, I am sure they<br/>
are<br/>
  fine but will feel better when I hear from her. I am rambling... I had the<br/>
  TV on too much and am grumpy...<br/>
<br/>
  I have been snapping at my kids, which makes me feel terrible. I have<br/>
heard<br/>
  some amazing personal stories from many of you. I have a story too, not<br/>
  always pretty. I used to spank my kids and yell a lot. We have been using<br/>
  unschooling as a path to healing, some days I feel it is working and I am<br/>
  amazed at all I have learned and how much stronger my relationship to my<br/>
  kids has become. Then there are days when I &quot;lose it&quot; and revert to my<br/>
  yelling. I am in counseling, but am about to be kicked off insurance, my<br/>
  counselor says I am one the sanest people she knows. But I don&#39;t always<br/>
feel<br/>
  that way. All it takes is one &quot;blow out&quot; for my kids to be in tears and my<br/>
  five year old to revert to some old behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel a bit like a failure tonight. I yelled at my kids, after neglecting<br/>
  them for two days. The current events will probably directly effect us,<br/>
  (husband is military).  My house is a mess, which always makes me feel<br/>
  badly. I could sure use some words of encouragment. Have any of you come<br/>
  from a troubled beginnings and overcome?<br/>
<br/>
  Please don&#39;t tear apart my post, I am sure I worded much of it poorly. I<br/>
am<br/>
  feeling a bit sensitive and not sure I want to deal with harsh words right<br/>
  now. I need some unschooling encouragment and words of guidance. Thanks .<br/>
