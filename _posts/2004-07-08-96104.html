<div id="ygrps-yiv-399142698">Just a year ago, my dad had a breakthrough.  My mom was a lot like <br/>
what has been described over and over in the posts here.  My dad <br/>
worked long hours and went to college on and off while we were <br/>
growing up.  He DID make time to coach the numerous teams that my two <br/>
brothers, one sister were involved in.  Anyway, it turns out that he <br/>
was feeling left out in the huggin and kissin department.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember him being really affectionate, but again, he was at least <br/>
THERE.  So my mom sits him down and explains to him that in order to <br/>
get affection from his four kids, their spouses and his 7 grandkids, <br/>
he needs to show affection.  Low and behold, he did and is getting <br/>
all the lovin&#39; he could ask for now!  Dad&#39;s can be redeemed if they <br/>
want.</div>
