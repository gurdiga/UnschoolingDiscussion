<div id="ygrps-yiv-758141587">I&#39;ve been talking with a lady who&#39;s parents are Chinese and emigrated to Canada just before they had 6 kids. We&#39;ve been discussing home-schooling and she was fascinated to hear that people HS&#39;ed for<br/>
non-religious reasons who weren&#39;t isolated by distance.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have any kids yet but so far is opposed to HS cos she says it would isolate and disadvantage immigrant children. If they don&#39;t go to school, she says, then they wont learn the culture,<br/>
language etc and become successful in the new country. She cites herself and 5 siblings as PS products who all have degrees now.<br/>
<br/>
Any non-english speaking immigrant families on this list? Maybe whose parents couldn&#39;t speak English want to chip in.I can see her point but I also feel HS could work in suh a family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How &#39;bout an American family in Germany?<br/>
<br/>
We were Air Force, but lived on the economy in a small town near Mainz. We <br/>
had &quot;service&quot; friends as well as German neighbor friends. Socialized with <br/>
them equally. I speak German, so it made it easier. <br/>
<br/>
We &quot;blended&quot; as well as we could. Cameron was only an infant---but was <br/>
walking and talking before we left. He fit RIGHT in with the neighbors. He <br/>
understood certain customs and certainly their language. I think that if the <br/>
parents isolate the children, they may take longer to blend in---but if the <br/>
children hang out with American kids, visit in their homes, talk with them on <br/>
the phone, go to birthday parties, etc.,  they should be just as &quot;American&quot; <br/>
as native kids. <br/>
<br/>
Going to school would basically let them know what &quot;school&quot; culture is ONLY. <br/>
And even Duncan will never know THAT! &lt;g&gt; On the plus side, this family&#39;s <br/>
children could be bi-lingual.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230420568">My husband is from Iran. He speaks great English, but sometimes doesn&#39;t <br/>
know some little funny things. Try explaining why one thing is &quot;corny&quot; <br/>
and something else is not. TOO hard - you just have to &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My parents came to the US from Puerto Rico. My mom was only 7, my father came when he was 16. They were the only immigrant students in their suburban public schools at the time. My grandparents spoke no English themselves. My mom is now a retail manager and my dad a lawyer. <br/>
<br/>
My parents always used and continue to use their own experience as newcomers who succeeded in learning a new language and culture and were successful. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is half Chilean,half Puerto Rican. Her dad ( whom doesn&#39;t live with us) speaks no English. I made the decision to Unschool specifically because I resented( and still do) the notion that success in this country can only come in a certain language, following a specific pov historically etc.  I mean even the term success is subjective. Can homeschooling work in a non English dominant, immigrant family? I would think so...even more so unschooling. What could be a problem is resources ( money, time, etc.<br/>
