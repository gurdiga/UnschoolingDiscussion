Not for all of fall. It&#39;s only a zoo here in the first couple of weeks when <br/>
the leaves  just turn then it settles down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639154583">Someone mentioned the Rowe Conference Center, and that name rang a bell, so I <br/>
asked around.  It turns out that an unschooler from the old AOL days <br/>
(Wolfsong) recently relocated there with her family (one unschooled child) to <br/>
work.  <br/>

That would be cool to have an unschooling conference at a center run by an <br/>
unschooler!<br/>

conferences. I&#39;ll follow up on it, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an option.<br/>
