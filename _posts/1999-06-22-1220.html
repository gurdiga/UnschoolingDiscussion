<div id="ygrps-yiv-96882099">&lt;&lt;Another issue no one has mentioned is college entrance.  There are quite a<br/>
number of colleges that also look at highschool GPA&#39;s to guage student<br/>
entrance qualifications. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually there&#39;s another college issue that I&#39;ve noticed--the (more <br/>
inexpensive) State colleges and universities tend to require an&quot;official&quot; <br/>
high school diploma and transcript.  It&#39;s the private schools that are more <br/>
open to looking at homeschoolers-but they cost a lot.  I have a few years to <br/>
think about this, but it has been on my mind lately.<br/>

<br/>
Just because they request it doesn&#39;t mean they require it.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  I used to work at admissions and records at the University of New <br/>
Mexico, and a long time ago.  Non-standard stuff comes through all the time, <br/>
and while someone WITH all the boring regular stuff attached gets put in a <br/>
pile, anyone with intesting exceptions will get passed all around the office <br/>
and people will learn the applicants  name and talk about him at lunch.  <br/>
<br/>
A letter saying &quot;I have not high school transcript because I was homeschooled <br/>
and one thing my mom&#39;s teaching me is never to fake or lie, and so in lieu of <br/>
a transcript, here&#39;s a letter describing my homeschooling&quot; has *GOT* to be <br/>
better than a faked up transcript of the Doddly Goodness Homeschool or some <br/>
such.<br/>

and then apply to the larger institution.  At that point, the GED and <br/>
transcripts from college classes are sufficient to be admitted.  I also think <br/>
this provides an easier transistion for the student from home to college.  <br/>
Allows more parental involvement (as needed) in making that transistion.  <br/>

experience.<br/>

#1.  This is what I am sort of assuming will happen around here.  Community <br/>
college because of the age/&quot;grade level&quot; differences in both my kids.<br/>
<br/>
#2.  Do I really want to send my kids to a college that doesn&#39;t want them <br/>
because of the way their forms are filled out???  This has to say something <br/>
about the institution as a whole.<br/>

stone to the larger universities.  The social environment is less daunting<br/>
and on a smaller scale, campuses are much more accessible, and as Eirual<br/>
(how do you say that?  It looks lovely!) mentioned, it allows kids to stay<br/>
home longer if need be, to adjust to their change in life status and their<br/>
new independence.<br/>
