<div id="ygrps-yiv-128608642">**My kids didn&#39;t want to &quot;READ,&quot; they wanted to read specific things.**<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps most kids do. But not all. 3 out of 4 of my kids were as you describe <br/>
here, learning to read at various ages because they found it a useful skill, <br/>
because there were things they wanted to read. <br/>
<br/>
The 4th though, the one whose learning to read I&#39;ve previously described <br/>
here, wanted to &quot;READ&quot;. She didn&#39;t have anything in particular in mind, no <br/>
particular book she wanted to read or information she wanted to have - she <br/>
knew how to get those by utilizing adult readers. She desparately wanted to <br/>
read for herself. I&#39;d have been content for her to wait much longer and be a <br/>
&quot;late&quot; reader, but she wasn&#39;t. It wouldn&#39;t have been respectful of me to say <br/>
to her &quot;sorry, you&#39;ll just have to wait&quot; without trying to support her <br/>
learning when that was what she wanted. To my mind, that&#39;s as important a <br/>
function of an unschooling parent as sheilding them from the expectations of <br/>
outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s comparable to learning to ride a bike. Some kids want to ride <br/>
because they have somewhere they want to go. Some want to ride because it <br/>
looks like fun. And some want to ride because they see it as a grown up skill.<br/>
<br/>
Often kids look at grown up skill stuff and they play at it. They play act <br/>
going to work, taking care of children, driving the car. They do the shopping <br/>
and run the train and man the phone lines and generally mess around with <br/>
trying on the world for size.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah wanted the grown up skill. She didn&#39;t want to wait to grow into it, and <br/>
even while she played at having it and using it she tried desparately to get <br/>
it, to own it, to claim it for herself. She wasn&#39;t going to wait to get <br/>
older, especially not while her twin was barrelling along reading everything <br/>
he laid his eyes on, seemingly effortlessly from her point of view. It really <br/>
wasn&#39;t FAIR! :)<br/>
<br/>
She asked for help. I did my best.<br/>
<br/>
**Perhaps I see Bob Books as little walking-chair-substitutes made just for <br/>
that purpose and no other. A special color, a special size, to stash around <br/>
the room so kids can walk.  And it seems families can just use chairs they <br/>
already have.**<br/>
<br/>
For most kids, most times, special walking chair substitutes aren&#39;t necessary <br/>
at all, and while they might come in handy for a short time, they&#39;d mostly be <br/>
a waste of space and money. But some kids DO need extra help, and for them <br/>
those substitutes might be the difference between a painful struggle toward <br/>
success and an agonizing failure.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah saw the BOB books at the public library and asked for her own. So we <br/>
bought them. The fact that they&#39;re absolutely positively simple, uncluttered, <br/>
not about much of anything was just what she wanted. She could concentrate on <br/>
just trying to match sounds to letter code. Real books were frustrating for <br/>
that purpose - she would want to understand the story/information and lose <br/>
focus.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t learn to read with the BOB books, but they helped her feel she was <br/>
reading when it was important to her to feel that.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;d have been labeled and remediated and turned into a nonreader in <br/>
schools, but here we just supported her as best we could and gave her lessons <br/>
when she asked, held her when she was frustrated, and tried to give her <br/>
&quot;child size tools&quot; when they seemed indicated.<br/>
<br/>
None of which is to say that I&#39;d generally &quot;recommend&quot; BOB widely, but I <br/>
certainly tell folks that they might want to look at them if they&#39;ve got a <br/>
frustrated reader.<br/>
