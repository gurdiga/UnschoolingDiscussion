<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280192289">&quot;When someone questions you about socialization, don&#39;t be defensive about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve sometimes responded with a hearty &quot;Oh, YES, that&#39;s one of the main <br/>
reasons we homeschool.&quot; Stops people cold while they puzzle over trying to <br/>
figure out what I mean. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t get questioned much anymore, so I don&#39;t get much chance to use my <br/>
finely honed defenses. In the last week we&#39;ve had four different people ask <br/>
&quot;no school today?&quot; when we were out and about, who all then said some <br/>
variation on &quot;Wonderful!&quot; when told by the kids that they are homeschooled. <br/>
Only one questioned them further, wanting to know how long; when the 17yo <br/>
replied &quot;All my life&quot; she told her that she was a very lucky girl.<br/>
