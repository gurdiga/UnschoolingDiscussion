--------  ------------  --------------------------------<br/>
  60      grams         Sugar<br/>
     1/2                Cinnamon stick<br/>
   4                    Cloves<br/>
                        Peel of 1/2 lemon<br/>
     1/8  liter         Water<br/>
   1      liter         Red wine<br/>
                        Juice of 1/2 - 1 lemon<br/>
<br/>
Put cinnamon, cloves and lemon peel in a paper tea filter; tie<br/>
it shut with a piece of white yarn. Together with the water and<br/>
the sugar, bring it to a boil in a pot, let sit for 20 minutes.<br/>
Take out the tea filter, add the red wine and heat. The art is<br/>
to heat the wine up as close to its boiling temperature without<br/>
ever getting it to boil (the most important thing about making<br/>
gluehwein is that the wine must NEVER boil). Finally, add lemon<br/>
juice to taste.<br/>
<br/>
 Possible variations: ~ leave away the lemon juice or use orange<br/>
juice instead ~ leave away the lemon peel ~ instead of boiling<br/>
the tea filter, put it directly into the wine, heat, and let<br/>
soak for 30 - 45 minutes (you don&#39;t need the water this way);<br/>
if you chop up the ingredients before putting them in the filter,<br/>
you get a more intensive flavor ~ add a few drops of vanilla<br/>
~ add a little cardamom and/or ginger ~ vary the quantities of<br/>
cinnamon, cloves and sugar ~ to get the possibly most famous<br/>
type of gluehwein, the Nuernberger Christkindlesmarkt-Gluehwein,<br/>
use blueberry wine instead of red wine <br/>
