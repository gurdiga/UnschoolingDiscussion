including removing a lot of foods a naturopath said she was allergic <br/>
to.  Nothing really helped, though changing their approach to her tantrums <br/>
helped some of the time.  My daughter also thinks she probably has sensory <br/>
integration disorder or is possibly bipolar.  They&#39;ve recently started her <br/>
on a supplement from a Canadian company called True <br/>

I haven&#39;t checked them out and I have absolutely no connection to them <br/>
other than my daughter raving about how much they&#39;ve helped.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
Skye has had a real-flip out since she started on them a couple of weeks <br/>
ago.  She still has to learn new habits of reacting to frustration, etc. <br/>
but they&#39;ve been able to talk her out of every flip-out that&#39;s <br/>
threatened.  This is something they only rarely could do before she started <br/>
the supplements, and her flip-outs were at least daily before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like your daughter is very similar to mine. Oh that sleep thing...she <br/>
stopped napping at 15 months. She&#39;s 6 1/2, is up til 10 or 10:30, often after <br/>
me, and up at 6 or 6:30. And believe it or not, we shoot for 8 as a bedtime. <br/>
It just takes that long! The last couple of months I&#39;ve been just letting her <br/>
go to bed most nights when she wants, and a couple nights a week she&#39;ll go <br/>
earlier, by and hour or hour and a half or so. That seems to be working <br/>
better. And up until this past year, she still woke every night. Now, not at <br/>
all, unless she has a bad dream. Chiropractics helped with that. She had leg <br/>
pains behind her knees every night for years, and the pediatrician kept <br/>
telling me they were activity pains, because she is so highly active (and <br/>
that&#39;s an understatement!!!), or growing pains.We did arnica cream, heating <br/>
pads, midnight hot baths, massage, children&#39;s Tylenol--nightly!!! I asked to <br/>
refer her to a chiro, he said no way, only an orthopedic specialist. So I <br/>
changed peds, got a referral, and after 4 sessions, she has had no pain <br/>
whatsoever. That was in April. I&#39;ve heard that adjustments can make a <br/>
difference for some kids with ADD and so forth, too.<br/>
I think she will always be a challenge for me. We spent last night, 9:30 to <br/>
12:30 in the ER with my hubby (he&#39;s fine), and DS was wonderful. Didn&#39;t fuss <br/>
at all. She was non-stop complaining, fussing, etc. <br/>
Oh, the Cherry Plum is for violent temper tantrums. It&#39;s horrid tasting. I <br/>
think the shock of how horrid it tastes quiets her down, LOL. But we&#39;ve done <br/>
breath work, visualizations when she is not upset so she&#39;ll have a place to <br/>
retreat to when she is upset. But I think the two things that help calm her <br/>
down from tantrums more than anything are: nature and water. The bath, or <br/>
swimming, depending on the season--water is a great restorative. And we have <br/>
a lovely property, with a stream, all kinds of wildlife, hundreds of flowers, <br/>
lots of frogs (she spends a lot of time with the frogs. She even talks to <br/>
them. Can&#39;t tell them apart!!) And sending her outside for a nature walk <br/>
usually seems very healing for her.<br/>
Reminds me of a lady I know, Linda Runyon. Not sure if anyone&#39;s ever heard of <br/>
her? She is a survivalist. She has been written about in several major mags <br/>
like People, and the NY Times, I think? She has a son (grown now) who was <br/>
diagnosed severely autistic, and 6 doctors her in NJ told her to <br/>
institutionalize him. She couldn&#39;t accept that, so she moved west (she&#39;s back <br/>
east now) and raised him &quot;off the land&quot;. She cooked outside in the snow <br/>
because her son couldn&#39;t handle it inside. She had no electricity, etc. They <br/>
foraged for their food. They ate things that grew naturally, like dandelion, <br/>
wood sorrel, plantain, roses, wild lettuce, etc. She is a well published <br/>
author now about this subject. Her son is now an internation fashion <br/>
designer, and Neiman Marcus recently bought his entire collection. He credits <br/>
his &quot;recovery&quot; with living so close to nature.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, We tried the cal-Mag, couldn&#39;t get her to take it. <br/>
One of her favorite bedtime rituals now is hot tea, her choice of flavor (she <br/>
usually picks Japanese tea or chamomile). The ritual thing is really <br/>
important for her, too. She does better if she knows what to expect. <br/>

My cousin my age who homebirthed five kids and lived in the country had a <br/>
wood stove she would put outside under the cottonwood trees in the summer <br/>
because it was too hot to cook inside, and in the winter they&#39;d bring it back <br/>
in so it would heat the house.<br/>
<br/>
Not related, but just a note that cooking outside isn&#39;t totally unheard of. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People here make bread in hornos (ORnos) in summer sometimes , an adobe oven <br/>
of sorts.  You build the fire in it and then scrape it out and put the bread <br/>
in.<br/>
