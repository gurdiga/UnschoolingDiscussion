<div id="ygrps-yiv-943468175">&quot;In the 1980&#39;s there was a LOT of group-counselling and self-help-group <br/>
busienss about &quot;healing the inner child&quot; and it might be worth doing a<br/>
 google search <br/>
for some of that. It can be really, really soothing to &quot;reparent,&quot; and<br/>
 generally involves communicating with your inner child, meaning (as I understood it when I was going to adult children of alcoholics meetings in 1985/86 and a few years thereafter) soothe your memories. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing....I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research for my upcoming workshop at the conference. Since we&#39;re delving into how everyone is a creative genius, the inner child thing comes up a lot for me.<br/>
I found a website that talked a bit about healing the inner child for abused kids and I thought it was appropriate to bring that into the workshop as well..since there&#39;ll be all types of people and probably a lot have dealt with some form of abuse that has shut down the creative process in so many ways.<br/>
We&#39;re all born with creative genius, toddlers are SO inquisitive, children so magically creative, what happens to all that wonderful energy? It&#39;s still there, waiting for us to remember, to tap into those very things that excited us as children.<br/>
I think healing the inner child is important on many levels and I&#39;m glad you mentioned this.<br/>
