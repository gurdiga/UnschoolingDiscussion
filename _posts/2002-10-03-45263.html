 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Oh, Mary and Sandra,  it really is refreshing to hear such nice things <br/>
about having children.  I feel like I am so surrounded by people who really <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy their kids!<br/>
When I was younger I only heard grandmas and grandpas saying things like <br/>
that, why is it that it takes alot of people so many years to actually see <br/>
that these children we have are so precious?  I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve realized this at <br/>
this age and I&#39;m just turning 35 this month, that&#39;s not too old? Is it??  I <br/>
feel really old sometimes, especially lately when my kids are staying up <br/>
later and later, new bedtime rules and they are loving it!!!  Now if I can <br/>
handle it!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know I have heard people say such awful things about families having <br/>
more than one or two kids. I&#39;m amazed everytime I hear it. I remember when I <br/>
was pregnant with Joseph and was at school to pick up Tara. She was 9 at the <br/>
time and I had seen one of the mom&#39;s of one of her classmates. Hadn&#39;t seen <br/>
her in awhile and she was aghast at my obvious state. Looked at me in horror <br/>
and very serioulsy asked me if I was nuts having another kid. How she just <br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine having more than one. I was horrified that she would <br/>
actually verbalize those thoughts, especially to my face. Needless to say, I <br/>
was pregnant with Sierra 4 months after Joseph was born and people really <br/>
thought I had totally lost it. This was coming from friends and family at <br/>
the time. I had lost a baby after Sierra was born and even my in laws just <br/>
dubbed me fertile mrytle and told me not to worry about the loss. Nice <br/>
family huh??<br/>
<br/>
I was so happy when I found my homeschool support group here. Just wonderful <br/>
loving thoughts for the kids and families. And when I was having Alyssa at <br/>
the age of 42, my hs group was so supportive and embraced the birth with us <br/>
all. Encouraged me so much and don&#39;t even look at me with a blink of an eye <br/>
when I express my thoughts of wanting another baby. What a difference it <br/>
made for me. I still have people look at me with shock when they see the 4 <br/>
little gold kids hanging around my neck.<br/>
<br/>
Then I drop my kids off once a week for a few hours of homeschool sports <br/>
camp and see the moms with 5, 6 and 7 kids and just smile with a bit of <br/>
envy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113251662">Boy, my first Email I have read tonight and a wonderful one at that! Let me<br/>
tell you my horrible experience today...I was coming out of Costco holding<br/>
the baby and my 3 yo daughter&#39;s hand when we stopped to look at The Blue<br/>
Angels flying over(Airshow in town). Anyway it took maybe a grand total of a<br/>
minute or less. We started to resume our walking to the parking lot and<br/>
there was a lady in front of my daughter(to my right) with her cart and we<br/>
were blocking her way. She gave me the dirtiest look and it just came to me<br/>
and Iblurted out&#39;Patience is a virtue!&quot; She got so mad she slammed her hand<br/>
in the garbage can. I was like &#39;WOA&#39; and had to calm myself down by saying a<br/>
prayer. I have had so many people say &#39;Is this it&#39;, &#39;Are you done?&#39; etc Even<br/>
my dad saying &#39;Oh, what are you trying to do-start a ballteam?&#39; Then the<br/>
other day these 2 women proudly announced in our MOPS group that their<br/>
husbands were going for Vasectomies and everyone laughed-well not me! I felt<br/>
so sad, and wondered how I could influence/encourage others to have more<br/>
children. Yes, everyone has their own life to live, but society plays such a<br/>
part, even Christian families that are supposed to follow God&#39;s laws to<br/>
multiply. I don&#39;t know if this is a Christian loop, but this is a part of my<br/>
life. Anyway, God has put it on my heart to look at my children with His<br/>
eyes, loving eyes and to see their qualities and the gifts He has given<br/>
them. I want to encourage my children and that is why I subscribed to<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
Has anyone read the book&#39;Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves?&quot;<br/>
by Allison McKee. I am just starting it and it&#39;s great so far!<br/>
Also, speaking of large families has anyone seen/read the magazine &#39;Joyful&#39;?<br/>
All about large families etc.<br/>
Sorry a long one...Amy Mother to 4 children and open to more. Thank You also<br/>
for the encouragement of having kids after 40!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249708975">Yes, everyone has their own life to live, but society plays such a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; part, even Christian families that are supposed to follow God&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Amy!  No, it&#39;s not a Christian group but there are a few <br/>
Christians on it.  I&#39;m a Christian mom of 3 kids, and I think it <br/>
would be really cool if God has more children planned for my future! <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree that we are under any laws to multiply, since I believe <br/>
we&#39;re under grace, not under law.  But I do believe that the Bible <br/>
teaches a general attitude of valuing and desiring children rather <br/>
than wanting to get rid of them whenever we can and trying not to <br/>
have them. I think it&#39;s sad how society devalues children and puts <br/>
value on things that don&#39;t really matter (money, career status)<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out the quiverfull email list?  It sounds like a <br/>
list you might enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, God has put it on my heart to look at my children with His<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; eyes, loving eyes and to see their qualities and the gifts He has <br/>
 </span></blockquote>given<br/>

many times do you hear someone say that they can&#39;t wait until school <br/>
starts so they can get rid of the kids all day?  Don&#39;t you just want <br/>
to try to make them see what a joy it can be to have the children <br/>
home with you? Or when you hear someone yelling and screaming at <br/>
their kids to get their homework done and you see a child in tears <br/>

even any if that wasn&#39;t what they wanted.  This earth is having enough<br/>
trouble coping with what the people here now are doing to it.  If only the<br/>
people who really wanted to had children, there&#39;d be plenty of room for big<br/>
families.  There are still too many people having children because it&#39;s<br/>
what&#39;s done, or because they think they should, or because their religion<br/>
says to, or because they think children will make them happy or save their<br/>
marriage, or whatever other reason other than really enjoying children.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess since I come from a big family I see this a bit differently. Children<br/>
have needs: emotional, spiritual, and physical. Meeting those needs fully<br/>
takes a whole, mature and secure parenting unit. What I&#39;ve seen in a lot of<br/>
big families, not all by any means, but many of them, is that the needs of the<br/>
parents come first. The older children end up parenting the younger children<br/>
and the older children do not usually have the experience, wisdom, or strength<br/>
to parent the younger children in the family in the way that children deserve<br/>
to be parented. Many children in big families do not get enough of a parent&#39;s<br/>
time or energy. This was probably just as true in the past as it is today, but<br/>
in the past at least food wasn&#39;t as expensive or supportive help as hard to<br/>
get and keep. <br/>
<br/>
In this day and age, they must also be financially secure. If one doesn&#39;t have<br/>
enough money then life is a daily struggle: teeth don&#39;t get fixed and children<br/>
don&#39;t get taken to doctors when they need it. I have met many children of<br/>
large families who choose to have no or few children just because they learned<br/>
close up just what those restrictions can mean to the individual. I also know<br/>
parents of families who loved the baby years but find the older teen years a<br/>
living hell and although they love all of their children, acknowledge that<br/>
they really didn&#39;t understand how difficult, both emotionally and financially,<br/>
raising so many children to adulthood would be.<br/>
<br/>
There are happy, wonderful, strong, secure big families out there, but, they<br/>
are also the ones with the resources, both emotional and financial, to support<br/>
them. Just as a having a partner doesn&#39;t make one whole, having a child<br/>
doesn&#39;t make one mature and responsible. We need to do the work on ourselves<br/>
so that we can give to others rather than take. Too many people have children<br/>
and use them to meet their own needs. We see these walking wounded around us<br/>
daily. Maybe we were those walking wounded ourselves and have worked years to<br/>
grow and mature to the point where we can give instead of just take. Bringing<br/>
life into this world should never be just about how it makes US feel. And<br/>
let&#39;s be honest, most of us here have had and nursed babies. Those hormones<br/>
are powerful. They make us feel GOOD. But being responsible is more than<br/>
keeping those baby hormones going. Maybe some young mothers don&#39;t even realize<br/>
just how powerful those hormones are?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are those who advocate for large families really concerned with the growth of<br/>
each individual to its maximum potential? Or are their motives based in the<br/>
fear &quot;other&quot; and so they encourage the increase of &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them&quot;? I<br/>
think it is natural to be concerned about &quot;other&quot;. I think we all have a bit<br/>
of this fear inside of us. I absolutely believe that each family has the right<br/>
to determine how many children they will have, but I also believe that they<br/>
have the obligation to parent each child in their family so that their<br/>
emotional, spiritual, and physical needs are met. The lord might provide, but<br/>
he does it through us with our hard work.<br/>

Well actually for me, the answer to those questions is a big no. When I hear <br/>
all those things, and I do often enough, I just think how sad for the kids. <br/>
But thinking and hearing the parents, I think that maybe the kids are better <br/>
off going to school than being home. When I hear people talk of how could <br/>
one bear to have more than one or two kids, I think how lucky this world is <br/>
that those parents don&#39;t have more. I have no inner need to try and convert <br/>
anyone. I think their words speak very loudly to how their circumstances <br/>
shouldn&#39;t change.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to let you know that not all women whose husbands are getting<br/>
vasectomies are so happy (and yes, I am sure that we are done, it was<br/>
a mutual decision). I know that this is the right decision for us (for<br/>
a lot of different reasons) but there is a part of me that is mourning the<br/>
fact that I will never have another baby grow inside me, that I will never<br/>
nurse another newborn (luckily my 2.5 yo is still going!). It is sad for <br/>
me to contemplate as I am moving out of this phase of my life.<br/>
<br/>
In deciding to stop with 2 kids, I struggled with my feeling that people who<br/>
really love kids have a lot of them (after all 2 is how many you are &quot;supposed&quot; <br/>
to have), but have since realized that it is not a competition. I absolutely<br/>
and thoroughly love being with my kids and I know moms with 3 or more kids<br/>
who weaned early (not because of problems, just did not seem to enjoy it or<br/>
see the need), send their 1 and 2 yos to mothers day out, can&#39;t wait for<br/>
their kids to go to kindergarten and can&#39;t wait for the summer to be over<br/>
so the kids go back to school. <br/>
<br/>
But I understand what you are saying...when you have something that is so basic<br/>
to your happiness it is hard to understand how others can not see it. I feel that<br/>
way about hsing...I can&#39;t understand how my friends do not see how much fun this<br/>
is and how much sense it makes. And you want to convince them all!<br/>
<br/>
So enjoy your family (and may it grow as large as you want it!) and rest assured<br/>
that not all of us with smaller families were just glad to get it over with. I <br/>
will always treasure my early memories with my boys, and although I will probably <br/>
always have a small piece of me that misses that newborn time, I also know that our<br/>
family is complete and happy. :o)<br/>

Its not forever. ...I also get the fun of being around some geat kids, of different ages. :-) And that was one reason why I wanted  large family- I grew up in a small family and I used to enjoy the fun my friends in large families had...My boys have the same sort of fun, there is always someone around to do something with...Leonie W. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Just because Andrea Yates believed that God <br/>
 wanted her to have a big family and she killed her kids doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
 that people who believe God wants them to have a big family are <br/>
 wrong &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point is, did Andrea Yates feel she had any choice?<br/>
People who blindly follow what they believe is Gods law, with no regard to <br/>
self preservation or need, end up in bad situations.<br/>
A Mom that believes she must do something in order to obey God, but isn&#39;t <br/>
doing it from the heart, is in a dangerous position. Or at least in a <br/>
miserable one often times.<br/>
It&#39;s wrong to make people believe something is Gods law, when it isn&#39;t AND it <br/>
goes totally against what is right and good for that person. <br/>
If you CHOOSE to have a big family, that choice will probably make you very <br/>
happy and blessed. If you are only doing it because you feel you have to, <br/>
what a terrible load to bear. That mother is not going to do the best for <br/>
those children either.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The hormones that were causing post partum depression could have been <br/>
 cured.  There are homeopathic remedies that treat people with post <br/>
 partum depression and even remedies that treat people who feel that <br/>
 there is something wrong with their children so they should kill <br/>
 them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, Andrea Yates is an extreme example. But I think it&#39;s rather <br/>
simplistic to say that she could just be cured with a homeopathic remedy. She <br/>
didn&#39;t want the baby to begin with, that is a huge warning sign.<br/>
Can homeopathic remedies make people want a baby they didn&#39;t want?<br/>
Don&#39;t answer that, we use homeopathic remedies here, I&#39;m aware of how they <br/>
work.<br/>
Yes, it can cure hormone imbalance due to post partum stuff.<br/>
But you are forgetting that she had circumstances foisted upon her that she <br/>
didn&#39;t want.<br/>
The &quot;cure&quot; is to quit making women do things to please some angry God (which <br/>
I don&#39;t actually believe that he is an angry God, but apparently some do) or <br/>
their dh&#39;s without regards to their own health.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087409224">How about a remedy for a selfish, totally unsupportive husband??  Her <br/>
husband had never even *changed a diaper*. From what I&#39;ve read, it was all <br/>
about him, and what he wanted.  I know that when my three (only three!) kids <br/>
were little I felt like there was nothing I could do well.  That gets better <br/>
with time, but this woman had NO BREAKS.  Don&#39;t get me started...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344964916"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I felt<br/>
&gt; so sad, and wondered how I could influence/encourage others to have more<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I* don&#39;t think that we should encourage others to have more children. <br/>
I think that the parents who are happy about the vasectomies SHOULD NOT<br/>
have more children.  We have the responsiblity as good parents to not<br/>
bring more children into this world that we can&#39;t provide for.  This<br/>
means emotionally and educationally as well as financially.  Clearly,<br/>
those who don&#39;t want more children, should NOT have more children.  Why<br/>
would we want more unwanted children in this world?   We need to enjoy<br/>
and appreciate and honor and provide for the children that already exist<br/>
before adding more to the lot!  Wonderful for you that your family is<br/>
capable of this.  Most families are not.  <br/>
<br/>
For the longest time I thought that I wanted 3 children.  Now that I<br/>
have two, I am strongly believing more and more every day that 2 is my<br/>
personal limit.  I love my children with everything in me.  I spend<br/>
practically 24 hours a day with them and I treasure every second (even<br/>
those hard ones).  However, I am realistic.  My children wear me out. <br/>
My children cost A LOT!  There are times with two when I am home alone<br/>
that I cannot physically meet both of their needs.  How would I do this<br/>
with more than what I have?  <br/>
<br/>
I love seeing happy and healthy large families.  Those that are<br/>
fulfilled seem SO fulfilled.  I envy them.  I look at them and see<br/>
children that aren&#39;t as demanding as mine and I think that perhaps that<br/>
is HOW their parents were capable of being good parents to the number of<br/>
children in their family.<br/>
<br/>
I might be more capable of properly caring for more children in the<br/>
future.  I&#39;ll keep that option open for a little while, but not for too<br/>
long since when I have an infant in the house my oldest gets neglected<br/>
and that is not fair to her.  However, I am very concerned about the<br/>
world overpopulation problem and I can&#39;t justify another pregnancy for<br/>
me.  If I have more children, it will be through adoption or an<br/>
accidental pregnancy (and I work very hard to make sure the latter won&#39;t<br/>
happen).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197718844">*Just wanted to let you know that not all women whose husbands are getting<br/>
vasectomies are so happy (and yes, I am sure that we are done, it was<br/>
a mutual decision). I know that this is the right decision for us (for<br/>
a lot of different reasons) but there is a part of me that is mourning the<br/>
fact that I will never have another baby grow inside me, that I will never<br/>
nurse another newborn (luckily my 2.5 yo is still going!). It is sad for <br/>
me to contemplate as I am moving out of this phase of my life.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would come out of lurkdom for a minute to expand further on <br/>
this.  I just had my fourth (and sorry to say last) baby on the 13th of last <br/>
month.  Dh is due to have a vasectomy this Friday and I can totally relate to <br/>
what Stephanie is saying.  Even though I know this is the right thing for us <br/>
I can&#39;t help feeling a little sad.  Dh thinks I am nuts, he can&#39;t comprehend <br/>
why a woman would want to go through it all over and over (I have great <br/>
pregnancies, but huge babies).  <br/>
<br/>
Being with my newborn is wonderful but in light of everything it seems almost <br/>
bittersweet to know that this is the last time I will ever experience this.  <br/>
Just adding my thoughts, thanks for listening.<br/>
