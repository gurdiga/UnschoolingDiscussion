<div id="ygrps-yiv-945676864">Thanks for the warm fuzzy Deb.<br/>
Your son sounds like a really incredible human being.<br/>
If you ever get over here to P&#39;cola, he&#39;d love our back yard.....right here <br/>
in town we have a pond and a creek with Blue Herons (occasionally) loads of <br/>
turtles a red shouldered hawk and we think OTTERS!  Not sure on the last <br/>
creatures since it was my near sighted dh that saw three of them a few <br/>
mornings ago, frolicking and playing in the pond.  He described them to me <br/>
and all I can think of is river otters, although what they are doing in the <br/>
middle of town is beyond me. <br/>
We have woods, but there is development all around them!  Weird.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! It sounds like kid paradise.<br/>
There&#39;s a creek behind our house that we&#39;ve lately taken to cleaning the<br/>
garbage out of.  We planted willows along the bank and the stretch along<br/>
our block is looking pretty nice. <br/>
The river that runs through our little town is listed as endangered. <br/>
It&#39;s full of heavy metals and arsenic from mining and smelting wastes. <br/>
An extensive clean up has been underway for many years, but it&#39;s a slow<br/>
process.  A big portion of the cleanup will begin in our area soon.  In<br/>
the sections that have been done there is improvement, with fish in the<br/>
river again and other little critters.  There was a time in this valley<br/>
when seeing a bird was rare and you couldn&#39;t find a snake to save your<br/>
life.  Things are slowly coming back.  <br/>
Your pond sounds ideal.  If we had a pond I&#39;d never see my child...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well get a Nintendo, because people SWEAR if you let them play all they want <br/>
they will NEVER stop.  Oh!  And TV.  Get cable.  Satellite!  Because people <br/>
SWEAR if you let them watch all they want they&#39;ll never do anything else.  <br/>
And food.  Get lots of food.  Candy.  Because I have been assured by parents <br/>
who know their children better than anyone that if they&#39;re not told when to <br/>
stop, they&#39;ll do nothing but eat junk all day.<br/>
<br/>
So NOBODY has to worry about kids doing the same thing all day, because each <br/>
person only has one whole day per... day!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563296417">Oh, oh, oh, I had to throw cake away yesterday! Chocolate!  We were<br/>
making a birthday cake and we still had some cake from the week, month?<br/>
before.  <br/>
TV wasn&#39;t on at all yesterday even though we have Cartoon Network. <br/>
Nobody ate any candy from the bowl on the table, (except the dog, which<br/>
might explain why no one else wanted any) <br/>
Some guilty party did eat two oranges...<br/>
And my 10 year old didn&#39;t kill anyone in spite of the Quake and Medal of<br/>
Honor games he&#39;s had for a year? now.  <br/>
<br/>
So OK Miss Sarcasm&lt;g&gt;.  He wouldn&#39;t spend all day EVERY day at the pond,<br/>
just those times when the turtles and frogs and snakes  and salamanders<br/>
and dragonflies were out and about, and when he wasn&#39;t eating paper clips<br/>
and banging his head on the wall because I never taught him to mop the<br/>
floor...LOL<br/>

&lt;&lt; Some guilty party did eat two oranges... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had company.  A &#39;school kid.&#39;  And some of the regular homeschooled <br/>
in&#39;n&#39;out kids.  We put a meal on the table, people ate kinda in shifts, it <br/>
was fun, it was fine. I had put chocolate syrup into most of a gallon of milk <br/>
and just set it out.  They could also have juice or soda or plain milk.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning the guest said &quot;You used a whole gallon of milk last night.  <br/>
I guess that&#39;s one way to get them to drink their milk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I kinda bristled at the &quot;their milk&quot; phrase.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;We go through at least a gallon of milk a day here even when we don&#39;t <br/>
have company.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He rared his head back a little and said &quot;REALly!&quot;  Not like he didn&#39;t <br/>
believe me, but like it was way unusual and surprising.  I said &quot;Keith and I <br/>
drink milk too,&quot; and that&#39;s all I said.<br/>
<br/>
We do have some friends who are lactose intolerant and if they had been over <br/>
we would have put juice out as the &quot;default&quot; instead, and anyone wanting milk <br/>
could&#39;ve done it by the glass on their own.<br/>
<br/>
I guess any kid who is MADE to drink &quot;his&quot; milk won&#39;t choose it voluntarily <br/>
over Dr Pepper, but my kids will.  Sometimes.  Depends on the food it&#39;s going <br/>
with and what their mood and hunger is.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like that choice thing. &lt;g&gt;  You can&#39;t choose without having a choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638908867">Michael-Anne (4 almost 5) loves water above any other drink. Almost everyone<br/>
we encounter who offers the child juice, soda, or water comments when she<br/>
says gratefully, &quot;Water.&quot; If they offer only soda and juice, she will muster<br/>
herself (she&#39;s not wild about speaking to people, our Mikey, including us!)<br/>
and say, &quot;Well, I really wanted some water.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those who don&#39;t actually know us probably think I&#39;ve been forbidding juice<br/>
and soda from birth to accomplish this &quot;miracle&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, who must, under interest of full disclosure, say that the other<br/>
daughter likes juice, soda AND milk better than water. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628913207">Has anyone here ever tried an Australian snack called Chocolate Crackles?<br/>
I lived in Australia for about a year when I was 12 and my mom made these<br/>
from a recipe off a box of &quot;rice bubbles&quot; (rice crispies).<br/>
They don&#39;t use marshmallow in the recipe, they use a product called Copha,<br/>
which is a coconut derived vegetable shortening.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, chocolate crackles are VERY yummy and I wish I could go out and<br/>
buy some Copha to make some here, but you can only buy the stuff in<br/>
Australia. I could mail order it, too, and may just do that, but with<br/>
shipping it&#39;d cost around $15! It might be worth it, though.<br/>

&gt; chips, and butterscotch chips all together, stir in Rice Krispies. Food of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801760256">Would these be anything like &#39;Refrigerator Cookies&#39;?<br/>
It&#39;s basically rice crispies (rice bubbles!), some cocoa powder, some <br/>
butter and I think some sugar and flour, warm it all, mix it with the rice <br/>
crispies and then drop it onto wax paper and pop it into the fridge or <br/>
freezer to chill.  Fabulously yummy!<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites though is &#39;Puppy Chow&#39;.  Get some chex (a hexagonal <br/>
breakfast cereal made from rice or corn), pour in some melted chocolate <br/>
(thin with sugar and butter!), stir to cover the cereal with the chocolate, <br/>
then shake in a closed plastic bag with some powdered sugar to coat.  Looks <br/>
JUST like puppy chow but tastes divine!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think Chocolate Crackles are Refrigerator Cookies, but they<br/>
sound very close. The recipe for CC is: 9 ounces Copha (coconut vegetable<br/>
shortening), 4 cups rice bubbles, 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 tbsp cocoa powder.<br/>
Melt Copha. Mix rice bubbles, powdered sugar and cocoa powder together, add<br/>
melted copha and mix well. Spoon into cupcake paper holders or spread in a<br/>
baking pan and cool in the fridge for 12-24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The Refrigerator Cookies sound very much the same and I think I&#39;ll try<br/>
making them. The only difference is the lack of Copha which adds a distinct<br/>
nutty coconut flavor that is very unique. Maybe just adding some shredded<br/>
coconut to the mix would do.<br/>

She also doesn&#39;t like boxed macaroni and cheese, says &quot;it <br/>
doesn&#39;t even taste like cheese!&quot;.  I guess it&#39;s because she was <br/>
raised on homemade &#39;cause they didn&#39;t have boxed stuff in the <br/>
UK.  I tried the boxed stuff when I came back here and thought it <br/>
was totally gross!  I used to live on the stuff, especially in college <br/>

lots of cola (because of the phosphoric acid and other chemicals <br/>

great and they don&#39;t have chemicals or caffine in them (just tons <br/>
of sugar &lt;g&gt;).  Tamzin prefers them because &quot;it doesn&#39;t make <br/>
