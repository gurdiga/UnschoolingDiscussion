months... now it&#39;s just kind of weird.  EVERYTHING is so expensive.  However, June <br/>
is &quot;free locals month&quot; so a lot of the museums and stuff are free right now.  <br/>
I need to get out and do something with these kids besides fish and swim <br/>
(although we do enjoy those things   : )    ~Kris<br/>

Oooooh, creepy name.<br/>
<br/>
For someone from far away who never heard of it, it sounds like a place where <br/>
snarling, barking, unnaturally big and hairy vines grow that attack at night.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going there.  I&#39;ll wait until it&#39;s on the late-night movies.<br/>

as in the name of the killer dog.  Somehow, that makes a difference  : )  ~Kris<br/>
