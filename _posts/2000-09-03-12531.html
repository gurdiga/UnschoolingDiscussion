<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917507634">I found out why it&#39;s called &quot;_Wild_ Discovery&quot; when my two daughters watched<br/>
the one about snakes. I never really thought about how snakes reproduce. I<br/>
kind of wish we still didn&#39;t know...I was in bed with a bad back when all<br/>
this happened. The next thing I hear is, &quot;Mommy! Snakes have penises!&quot; Oy.<br/>
It was a wild discovery, all right.<br/>
