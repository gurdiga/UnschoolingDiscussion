Bill to regulate home schools dies with help from parents<br/>
<br/>
By Jennifer Hamilton/The Gazette<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DENVER - About 150 home-school parents and children learned a lesson in<br/>
government Monday as they helped defeat an attempt to put more government<br/>
controls on home-schooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143508519">He said he proposed the bill in response to constituents who wondered why<br/>
students were roaming the streets and stores during school hours. Some<br/>
truant students were getting out of being punished by claiming they were<br/>
being home-schooled, Vigil said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The problem is that we have very lenient home-school laws, and we have no<br/>
way of preventing anyone from going to home-schools,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to<br/>
close that loophole and discourage them from going to home-school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How awful and prejudiced!<br/>
Could this be the reason some people who homeschool are afraid to go out<br/>
during school hours where I live? Nosey brainwashed people like to report<br/>
kids as being truant. I think it must be very hard on hs teens if they have<br/>
to be treated so badly by others! It is like a witch hunt isn&#39;t it even if<br/>
those kids were lying and not being hschooled they obviously were doing no<br/>
harm and maybe even helping the economy. This worries me also as a<br/>
registered democrat that they (democrats) are too school happy. I am glad to<br/>
hear that Coloradans defeated this bill. What can I do to stop this<br/>
insanity? Did someone mention something about lobbying here for more rights?<br/>
