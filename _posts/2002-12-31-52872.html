<div id="ygrps-yiv-643599230">Just got back from a family gathering &lt;sigh&gt;.  It was hard to watch the kids<br/>
be so disrespected (17 yo kids having to ask his parents if he can have a<br/>
soda, being told that I need to pull Adriane out of the love of her life<br/>
(gymnastics) because the competition can&#39;t be good for her, aunts getting<br/>
miffed at 3yo for being fussy after spending a week in a strange house with<br/>
17 other people).  Even though I love my family I was soooo glad to get<br/>
home.  Then......<br/>
<br/>
the woman who adopted my Marsie&#39;s birth sisters came to visit.  She<br/>
controlled what the girls said, ate, watched, played, listened to and not in<br/>
a gentle manner.  She truly believes with all her heart that these lovely<br/>
little girls would be sluts and drug addicts except for the fact that she is<br/>
&quot;training them up&quot; right.  I can&#39;t imagine what it must be like to have your<br/>
mother think so little of you.  I was a nervous wreck by the time they left<br/>
and the little girls seemed terribly sad.  Even dh (who usually doesn&#39;t<br/>
notice much) said the girls didn&#39;t look like they were having fun at all.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that I have this space to breathe easy and know that  there are<br/>
people who truly love and respect their children.  Thanks.<br/>

It must have seemed like a year.  Holidays must not be too much fun when <br/>
you&#39;re around people who feel like they know how to raise their children, but <br/>
really don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388548357">Here, Here!  I had one of those visits, too.... I am sooooo glad to be home.  (And, I have an apt. full of boxes that I keep tripping over, plus a 14mo. old who continuously wants to be &quot;rescued&quot; from the stairs,etc..etc..  we&#39;re moving to Fla at the end of Feb., but even with our chaos it&#39;s much better to be &quot;home&quot;.)  May God bless us with much love and patience!!!  Happy New Year!<br/>
