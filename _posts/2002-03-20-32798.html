&gt; Hi all, Jacli (Cleopatra) here :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a quick note.  As much as I enjoy and learn from every<br/>
&gt; digest on this list I<br/>
&gt; still felt a need to add this note.  I am a dark skinned<br/>
&gt; Costa Rican with 7 sisters and brothers and my hubby one of<br/>
&gt; three and is from Northern Italian.  Every time I read a<br/>
&gt; post about Irish or Italian families<br/>
&gt; yelling or Spanish/Mexican families having bad tempers I<br/>
&gt; cringe.  It reminds me of<br/>
&gt; nasty comments made by teachers when I was little about<br/>
&gt; Mexicans being lazy<br/>
&gt; or assumptions by highschool boys about Spanish girls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do not believe that any person on this list wrote with<br/>
&gt; malicious intent but I do<br/>
&gt; believe that these kinds of generalizations hurt and<br/>
&gt; cripple.  My parents were both<br/>
&gt; abusers.  Physically, emotionally.  Growing up in my house<br/>
&gt; was akin to growing up in<br/>
&gt; a battlefield.  My father was vicious and my mother<br/>
&gt; mentally unstable.  I never knew<br/>
&gt; what would set her off, every day, every night was a trip<br/>
&gt; through the minefields.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember once an aunt of mine happened by just after my<br/>
&gt; father had punched my 4 year<br/>
&gt; old brother&#39;s head into a wall (he had spilt milk on the<br/>
&gt; table).  She sent my uncle into the room to take care of<br/>
&gt; him while she tended to my black eye and split lip.  I<br/>
&gt; remember her breath on my face<br/>
&gt; while she told me it was not his fault, since their father<br/>
&gt; beat all of them.  I also remember<br/>
&gt; thinking, no it is his fault.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My father and mother were abusers.  Not because of past<br/>
&gt; connections or treatment or<br/>
&gt; even because of being Costa Rican.  They were abusers<br/>
&gt; period.  My father was a silent striker.<br/>
&gt; He didn&#39;t yell.  He didn&#39;t raise his voice.  Just his fist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband has a gentle nature and a soft spoken way.  His<br/>
&gt; family live in America now and are as different from mine<br/>
&gt; as night and day.  They are extraordinarrily quiet and<br/>
&gt; jovial and gentle people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we need always to remember that people are who they<br/>
&gt; are because of the choices they make and the environment<br/>
&gt; they make them in.  I am a very quiet individual, so are<br/>
&gt; most of my brothers and sisters.  Except for the ones who<br/>
&gt; are loud.  Because that&#39;s just the way they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t usually share this much personal info (ever<br/>
&gt; actually) nor do I usually write long posts.<br/>
&gt; But I had to write and let folks know that at least one<br/>
&gt; person has been offended by the use of<br/>
&gt; these generalizations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks for listening<br/>

Half Italian, Half Irish here.. and oh what fun we had as kids at <br/>
extended family gatherings.. which were almost every night...<br/>
<br/>
We were loud, we yell, we move our hands a lot... so no, I did not find <br/>
the original post to be negative.. I found it to be nostalgic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes that&#39;s true but it is also true that our own experiences and <br/>
beliefs play into how we read other&#39;s words.  For example, I might say <br/>
my kids &quot;gotta&quot; do the dishes everyday.  And what that amounts to IN <br/>
REAL LIFE is that my kids do the dishes most of the time.  Somedays <br/>
the dishes just sit there, some days they get done at midnight and <br/>
some days dh or I might do them.  But by saying that little word <br/>
&quot;gotta&quot; I&#39;ve made people who are used to dealing with others who are <br/>
authoritarian believe that I am that way too, when it is just a matter <br/>
of sloppy semantics and odd nuances of words.<br/>
<br/>
So if you like me have generalities on your household about who does <br/>
what, you are much more likely to take my statement the way I meant <br/>
than of you are at either end of the spectrum, the authoritarian end <br/>
or the &quot;no requirements&quot; end.  So your point of view affect show you <br/>
see my words and vice versa.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911134125">I sent a reply to your e-mail but I&#39;m thinking it was one of those that<br/>
Yahoo ate!  My answer was a resounding &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My original comments were with regards to desensitizing situations.  If you<br/>
grow up around loud families, then you don&#39;t notice the decibel level.<br/>
Folks that don&#39;t grow up around it will see it in a totally different light<br/>
OR be absolutely bombarded by it.<br/>
