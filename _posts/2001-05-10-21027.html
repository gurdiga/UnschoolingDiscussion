<div id="ygrps-yiv-4590814">Huuuuge cross-posting here, just to let the whole world (well the <br/>
bits I know about anyway) know that I&#39;m not online for a week from <br/>
tomorrow, and I&#39;m going on digest (can&#39;t do no-mail, can&#39;t go <br/>
completely cold-turkey) from now, so if anyone wants me, they <br/>
have until tomorrow am (am here that is :-) ) to email me offlist, <br/>

If you&#39;re going, c u @ HESFES, if you&#39;re not, see you much, much <br/>
later *grin*<br/>
