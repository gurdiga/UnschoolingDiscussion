<div id="ygrps-yiv-710387339">I&#39;ve been on the list for a month and have responded to a few things, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think I ever wrote a proper self-intro. I&#39;m Hikaru, a transplanted<br/>
Connecticut Yankee, residing permanently in Japan with my (Japanese) husband<br/>
and our son, who will be 3 in January<br/>
(speaking of January birthdays...and dh&#39;s is December 29th).<br/>
I teach part time at a university and since I began to learn about<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling have found myslf totally questioning a lot of<br/>
what I learned in graduate school.<br/>
(thanks a LOT folks!! &lt;g&gt;) I also read Tarot cards two afternoons a month at<br/>
a coffeehouse<br/>
and volunteer with my local chapters of La Leche League.<br/>
<br/>
I really began leaning toward the idea of natural learning when, about a<br/>
month ago, out of a clear blue sky Ds pointed to a sign and exclaimed &quot;W !!&quot;<br/>
I had never consciously encouraged him to learn to read, but since then he<br/>
has learned the whole alphabet and numbers up to 10. Once he decided that he<br/>
was ready, it was amazing how fast he picked them up. I used to teach quite<br/>
a few small kids whose parents were putting so much pressure on them, they<br/>
would break down if they made a mistake, or would simply refuse to answer a<br/>
question unless they were already sure of the right answer. I see the<br/>
results of this kind of &quot;education&quot; with my college freshmen and don&#39;t want<br/>
that for my son.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m particularly curious, how many of us here have a teaching background and<br/>
how has that helped or hindered your unschooling your children?<br/>
And are there any other bilingual/bicultural families here and how does that<br/>
fit into unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Many New Year&#39;s blessings to all......in Japan this is the Year of the Sheep<br/>
and there are<br/>
sheep decorations everywhere.....baaaaaaaaaa<br/>

Hi, I&#39;m new to this group, just joined today.  I homeschool my 12 yr <br/>
old son part time, and send him to a charter school for science.  I <br/>
also teach a Literature and Writing Circle for middleschoolers at the <br/>
school, of which my son is a student.<br/>
<br/>
I hold a B.A. degree in Multiple Subjects, but do not have a <br/>
credential, deciding at graduation that I DID NOT want to be a part <br/>
of the state educational system.  I have taught private school, and <br/>
also had my own tutoring business over the years.  Since my son was <br/>
born, I have been at home full time, earning extra money doing <br/>
desktop publishing for clubs and organizations, teaching basic <br/>
computer skills, and tutoring K-12 students in all subjects.<br/>
<br/>
My main job has been raising and educating my son.  I finally pulled <br/>
him out of regular public school last year, after finally convincing <br/>
my husband that it was in our son&#39;s best interest to educate using <br/>
alternative schooling methods such as the charter school.  Thank God <br/>
the school is so supportive of homeschooling and unschooling.  They <br/>
have been very helpful and encouraging about the choices I have made <br/>
for my son.  Basically they offer a variety of classes at the school, <br/>
with an emphasis on Scienct and Math.  Many classes are taught by <br/>
parent volunteers like me.  I like the variety of choice available to <br/>
my son.  He was able to choose for himself which classes he wished to <br/>
take in the charter school setting, and which areas he wished to <br/>
learn at home.  <br/>
<br/>
At first, it was difficult to let go of my need to impress on him <br/>
a &quot;schedule&quot; for his days at home.  I had to let go of the idea that <br/>
I was supposed to be &quot;teacher&quot; during &quot;school-time&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; the <br/>
rest of the time.  Another homeschool/charter school parent helped me <br/>
realize that as my son&#39;s &quot;Mom&quot; I am ALWAYS teaching him.  Now, after <br/>
several months, I  am much more relaxed, and allow him to choose for <br/>
himself what he wishes to learn and when.  I discovered that if I <br/>
just provide a variety of learning opportunities, and then get out of <br/>
the way, learning will take place naturally, and will be a joy for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
We are a bi-racial family.  I am French/Cherokee and my dh is black.  <br/>
As far as how our being a bi-racial family fits into homeschooling, I <br/>
incorporate much more cultural awareness and history than he would <br/>
get at a public school.  We live in a rural area of northern <br/>
California, and, unfortunately, there is a lot of racism in our <br/>
area.  There is very little cultural awareness or history, especially <br/>
Black History, taught in the public schools here.  A nod is given on <br/>
Martin Luther King Day; perhaps with one day of general history that <br/>
includes Dr. King&#39;s story and a sanctimonius message <br/>
about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;.  Unfortunately, the life lessons <br/>
my son has learned at the public schools, and, indeed, in our local <br/>
neighborhood about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are not encouraging.  <br/>
He has had to learn that there are those who wish him ill merely for <br/>
the color of his skin.  But I also teach that there are many others <br/>
who respect and care about him for his character and talents, <br/>
irregardless of his ethnic background.  We attend marches and <br/>
festivals to celebrate his African heritage, as well as pow-wows and <br/>
classes at the local Indian Educatin Center.   <br/>
<br/>
At home, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about gangs and gang violence, or <br/>
about kids from racist homes harassing him or beating him up.  At his <br/>
charter school, there are only about 30 kids in the middle school <br/>
grades.  All come from good families where the parents are <br/>
enlightened and very involved with their kids education.  As when he <br/>
was in public school, he is the only black kid in his class.  But the <br/>
atmosphere of inclusion at his new school is so different from the <br/>
atmosphere of exclusion he knew before!<br/>
<br/>
I know homeschooling my son is the right choice for our family.  I <br/>
wish to learn more about unschooling.  This is a new concept for me.  <br/>
But I like what I&#39;m learning about it.  Perhaps next year, I&#39;ll be <br/>
ready to make the leap to unschooling...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550988562">&lt;&lt;Perhaps next year, I&#39;ll be <br/>
ready to make the leap to unschooling...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the very coolest things about unschooling is there are no schoolyears. <br/>
 So if you get brave enough to make the leap in mid February or tomorrow <br/>
afternoon at 2:00, that&#39;s a better time than next year.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; perhaps with one day of general history that <br/>
includes Dr. King&#39;s story and a sanctimonius message <br/>
about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before the latter part of Dr. King&#39;s life it wasn&#39;t easy to hear any messages <br/>
about brotherhood and equality in the U.S.  Before the Civil Rights act, <br/>
racism was beyond anything most people born more recently can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s not racism.  But to put quotations on &quot;brotherhood&quot; <br/>
and &quot;equality&quot; as though there&#39;s no benefit in their even being discussed <br/>
isn&#39;t right.  There are still people living who lived when and where blatant <br/>
segregation was entirely legal.   Nothing can change everybody and everything <br/>
all of a sudden (except maybe a meteor hitting the earth WHAMMO, at which <br/>
point racism will be the least of our problems, or another way to think of it <br/>
is people won&#39;t HAVE any more problems).<br/>

I enjoy reading about history, but there is a lot I still don&#39;t know.  I<br/>
was actually startled to read in an article about Trent Lott that when<br/>
Strom Thurmond was running for prez, 1948, NO African-Americans in<br/>
Lott&#39;s state of Mississippi were allowed to vote.<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty shocking to me to revisit that fact.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125490287">**Another homeschool/charter school parent helped me <br/>
realize that as my son&#39;s &quot;Mom&quot; I am ALWAYS teaching him.**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Becky --<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet you.  I just wanted to warn you that the word &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
sometimes raises flak in this forum.<br/>
<br/>
The main point is that a lot of us believe that learning is something<br/>
that a person does to themselves, with or without the help of a teacher<br/>
or a book.  The learning happens in the mind of the learner.  When I see<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; as a transitive verb, with the student as the object, I feel<br/>
uncomfortable.  (I don&#39;t think young people should be treated like<br/>
objects, and that sometimes happens in the assembly-line public school<br/>
system, as you know.)  I like the Yeats (?) quote that says teaching or<br/>
learning isn&#39;t like filling a bucket, it&#39;s like lighting a fire.<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s tempting to rephrase what you said above to break it into two ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1) As a human being, your son is always learning from the world around him.<br/>
<br/>
2) As his mom, one of the most important people in his life **, your son<br/>
interacts very frequently with you and learns a great deal from those interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m fiddling around here *just* to make the word &quot;teach&quot; go away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m uncomfortable with saying that we teach our children, but I&#39;m fine<br/>
with saying that we inspire them.  Your mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
** I would have said &quot;most important&quot; but then some wonderful dads would<br/>
probably argue with me.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008057756">Hi Hikaru,<br/>
<br/>
Where did you learn Japanese?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m particularly curious, how many of us here have a teaching background and<br/>
&gt;how has that helped or hindered your unschooling your children?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a teaching background in the same sense as Americans do, <br/>
because you study to be teachers and that was not required in my <br/>
country, but I taught at a college when I was younger, both Literature <br/>
and languages (English as a second language and French). I must say that <br/>
most of my students were older than me! It was fun for a while and a <br/>
good pay at the time. It&#39;s been so long, though, that I don&#39;t think it <br/>
either hinders nor helps in any way now.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And are there any other bilingual/bicultural families here and how does that<br/>
&gt;fit into unschooling?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our family is somewhat bilingual/bicultural. Sort of... My husband is <br/>
American and so is my daughter, but I was born in Mexico of Spanish <br/>
parents. So, I do speak to my daughter in Spanish when we are alone, but <br/>
I don&#39;t identify myself too much with either the Mexican or the Spanish <br/>
culture, so she is absorbing mostly the American culture (not <br/>
mainstream), along with any european taints I may be projecting (most of <br/>
my education was European). We follow a spiritual Hindu tradition too, <br/>
so she learns from that as well. Anyway, it&#39;s like an ecclectic mixture <br/>
of things I guess. I think it brings variety into unschooling, but I <br/>
suppose all unschoolers have variety in their lives anyway, just in <br/>
different shapes and forms.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hikaru, I fit this description, and I&#39;m new to this list, though not to <br/>
unschooling.  (My 18-year-old has been unschooling for 10 years.)  I <br/>
taught  in elementary schools for 4 years after I graduated from <br/>
college in 1965.  In the spring of my second year of teaching, I read <br/>
Summerhill, and was forever changed.  It brought to the forefront <br/>
things that, at some level, I already knew. But I was very shy, and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t until I had children that I became brave enough to live these <br/>
ideas.  My daughter was born in 1969, and I became an at-home mom--very <br/>
clear in knowing that, even if it meant being poor, it was the only <br/>
thing that made sense to me.  When she was 2, she attended Community <br/>
Play Group (a cooperative), where children were free to choose how they <br/>
spent their time.  When she was 3, I was given this preschool and <br/>
stayed involved for 8 more years.  In 1979, a second daughter was born, <br/>
and it wasn&#39;t long before I came across books by John Holt, which <br/>
reinforced what I had been lucky enough to observe in my own children <br/>
and the children in the cooperative preschool.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 awesome children (ages 33, 23, and 18), and when people ask me <br/>
what I did as a parent that made them so awesome, I tell them that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t what I did, but rather it was what I didn&#39;t do.  I spent (still <br/>
do) lots of time getting to know who they are instead of trying to make <br/>
them be who they aren&#39;t.  Choice (which, I like to say, began in the <br/>
womb) was always (well, o.k., almost always) a part of their lives, and <br/>
they learned from the choices they made.  What I wanted for my children <br/>
was for them to know themselves, be happy, know how to solve problems, <br/>
and pursue their passions.  Each child has taught me something major <br/>
about life, which has been my biggest surprise about mothering.  My <br/>
parents never said, &quot;We learned so much from you children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 From the time I was in elementary school, I knew I wanted to be a <br/>
teacher.  I haven&#39;t called myself teacher for a long time, because that <br/>
implies imparting knowledge.  Instead, I think of myself as sharing in <br/>
the life journey of people of all ages.  Not a title,  just a person.  <br/>
At present, I�m known as tutor to 20 in-school children who live in <br/>
public housing, consultant to 28 homeschooling (some unschoolers, some <br/>
not) families, Mom to my unschooler son and grown children, and Nana to <br/>
almost-3-year-old Ylena.  Hmmm.  Are those titles?<br/>
<br/>
Did having a teaching background help or hinder my unschooling  <br/>
leanings?  Who can say?  Teaching school, being a parent, having a <br/>
preschool, tutoring, living life--all of these experiences have <br/>
contributed to this passion of mine, this belief that the best learning <br/>
happens where there is freedom to pursue one�s interests and passions.  <br/>
Have I wrestled with my background in traditional schooling and teacher <br/>
education?  You bet!  When we first dumped the curriculum and Zach  <br/>
spent hours playing with Legos, I had weekly panic moments about what <br/>
we weren&#39;t doing.  Over time, we learned to laugh at these, and they <br/>
gradually ceased.  I think there&#39;s a developmental process that takes <br/>
place as people who have been traditionally schooled  move toward <br/>
embracing unschooling.  From doubts  and fear,  to observations of <br/>
growing happiness and contentment in their children and harmony in the <br/>
family, to realizing that their children have learned amazing things <br/>
without knowing when or how they learned them, to knowing that this is <br/>
the path that works for their children and their family.  Which is not <br/>
to say that they won&#39;t be thrown into the place of doubt and fear many <br/>
times.  It seems to be part of the unschooling learning curve, and this <br/>
list is probably a good place to come with those feelings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*************************************<br/>
Hi, I&#39;m new to this group, just joined today.  I homeschool my 12 yr <br/>
old son part time, and send him to a charter school for science.  I <br/>
also teach a Literature and Writing Circle for middleschoolers at the <br/>
school, of which my son is a student.<br/>
<br/>
I hold a B.A. degree in Multiple Subjects, but do not have a <br/>
credential, deciding at graduation that I DID NOT want to be a part <br/>
of the state educational system.  I have taught private school, and <br/>
also had my own tutoring business over the years.  Since my son was <br/>
born, I have been at home full time, earning extra money doing <br/>
desktop publishing for clubs and organizations, teaching basic <br/>
computer skills, and tutoring K-12 students in all subjects.<br/>
<br/>
My main job has been raising and educating my son.  I finally pulled <br/>
him out of regular public school last year, after finally convincing <br/>
my husband that it was in our son&#39;s best interest to educate using <br/>
alternative schooling methods such as the charter school.  Thank God <br/>
the school is so supportive of homeschooling and unschooling.  They <br/>
have been very helpful and encouraging about the choices I have made <br/>
for my son.  Basically they offer a variety of classes at the school, <br/>
with an emphasis on Scienct and Math.  Many classes are taught by <br/>
parent volunteers like me.  I like the variety of choice available to <br/>
my son.  He was able to choose for himself which classes he wished to <br/>
take in the charter school setting, and which areas he wished to <br/>
learn at home.  <br/>
<br/>
At first, it was difficult to let go of my need to impress on him <br/>
a &quot;schedule&quot; for his days at home.  I had to let go of the idea that <br/>
I was supposed to be &quot;teacher&quot; during &quot;school-time&quot; and &quot;Mom&quot; the <br/>
rest of the time.  Another homeschool/charter school parent helped me <br/>
realize that as my son&#39;s &quot;Mom&quot; I am ALWAYS teaching him.  Now, after <br/>
several months, I  am much more relaxed, and allow him to choose for <br/>
himself what he wishes to learn and when.  I discovered that if I <br/>
just provide a variety of learning opportunities, and then get out of <br/>
the way, learning will take place naturally, and will be a joy for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
We are a bi-racial family.  I am French/Cherokee and my dh is black.  <br/>
As far as how our being a bi-racial family fits into homeschooling, I <br/>
incorporate much more cultural awareness and history than he would <br/>
get at a public school.  We live in a rural area of northern <br/>
California, and, unfortunately, there is a lot of racism in our <br/>
area.  There is very little cultural awareness or history, especially <br/>
Black History, taught in the public schools here.  A nod is given on <br/>
Martin Luther King Day; perhaps with one day of general history that <br/>
includes Dr. King&#39;s story and a sanctimonius message <br/>
about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;.  Unfortunately, the life lessons <br/>
my son has learned at the public schools, and, indeed, in our local <br/>
neighborhood about &quot;brotherhood&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are not encouraging.  <br/>
He has had to learn that there are those who wish him ill merely for <br/>
the color of his skin.  But I also teach that there are many others <br/>
who respect and care about him for his character and talents, <br/>
irregardless of his ethnic background.  We attend marches and <br/>
festivals to celebrate his African heritage, as well as pow-wows and <br/>
classes at the local Indian Educatin Center.   <br/>
<br/>
At home, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about gangs and gang violence, or <br/>
about kids from racist homes harassing him or beating him up.  At his <br/>
charter school, there are only about 30 kids in the middle school <br/>
grades.  All come from good families where the parents are <br/>
enlightened and very involved with their kids education.  As when he <br/>
was in public school, he is the only black kid in his class.  But the <br/>
atmosphere of inclusion at his new school is so different from the <br/>
atmosphere of exclusion he knew before!<br/>
<br/>
I know homeschooling my son is the right choice for our family.  I <br/>
wish to learn more about unschooling.  This is a new concept for me.  <br/>
But I like what I&#39;m learning about it.  Perhaps next year, I&#39;ll be <br/>
ready to make the leap to unschooling...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had many fears per se, but I too have had some <br/>
serious doubts, like when our then 16-year-old son just wasn&#39;t the <br/>
least bit interested in reading. Nothing. Nada. He seemed to get <br/>
along fine without reading, so we left him alone (which wasn&#39;t easy, <br/>
*believe* me), and suddenly one day - nobody knows how - he was <br/>
reading as well as anyone else in the family (a family of VERY <br/>
serious readers - hey, we&#39;re *publishers!*). Would he have learned <br/>
sooner if we&#39;d &quot;encouraged&quot; him? Maybe. But we knew he&#39;d get around <br/>
to it eventually, and he was getting along just fine without our help <br/>
- enjoying an extremely busy social life of snowboarding, working, <br/>
travelling and filming professional-level videos with several <br/>
friends. Reading just wasn&#39;t on his list of things to do that week. <br/>
Or month. Or year. But he figured it out somewhere along the way.<br/>
<br/>
And if he hadn&#39;t? I dunno. I&#39;d probably still be fretting and biting <br/>
my tongue. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
