<br/>
&lt;&lt; And some of the essays that were <br/>
<br/>
supposedly about unschooling talked about doing unit study type <br/>
<br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t mind some &quot;unit study type stuff,&quot; depending how loosely that&#39;s <br/>
considered.   <br/>
<br/>
I DO mind units that moms decide should happen and that involve assignments <br/>
and schedules and final projects.  But my main objection is to the &quot;unit&quot; ever <br/>
ending!<br/>
<br/>
If someone here gets interested in something we sometimes stew in it, splash <br/>
in it, bask in it, wrap ourselves all up in it.  <br/>
<br/>
Eddie Izzard.  We got someone in England to get us his book which wasn&#39;t <br/>
available in the U.S.  In a fairly short while we got two DVDs, two CDs, shared <br/>
websites back and forth (me, Marty, Kirby and a few other friends outside the <br/>
house), we rented &quot;Mystery Men&quot; to see him in that.  We gave copies of &quot;Dress to <br/>
Kill&quot; as gifts to a couple of friends in that heavy Eddie Izzard season.   <br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t stop doing other things.  Nobody was required to study Eddie Iz<br/>
zard.  Holly avoided it all, but lately she has said &quot;I want to watch Eddie Izzard <br/>
now,&quot; and we just haven&#39;t gotten a calm space to do it.  We will.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was in college and Brother Sun, Sister Moon came out, I LOVED that <br/>
movie.  We had no opportunity for renting videos yet in those days.  I went to <br/>
the Santa Fe public library and cleaned them out on St. Francis stuff.  Read it <br/>
all.  Bought a couple of used books.  Read them, kept them.  I started to <br/>
notice or remember all the northern-New Mexican St. Francis iconography I had kind <br/>
of ignored growing up.   After I&#39;d immersed myself in it for a month or so, <br/>
it became a good part of me.  I still watch the movie sometimes.  I still think <br/>
of some of the stories from The Little Flowers of St. Francis, a collection <br/>
of anecdotes written down by early Franciscans.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody made me &quot;study&quot; St. Francis.  I didn&#39;t report it to anyone (except you <br/>
folks, 30 years later, kind of, just now! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So if someone recommends voluntary splashy immersion, I can only say I&#39;ve li<br/>
ved my life that way.  It&#39;s the non-voluntary unit studies that I think go <br/>
against unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
My boys have done Halo weeks where they watch Red vs. Blue and play Halo a <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve done &quot;Strongbad&quot; marathons because someone comes over who hasn&#39;t seen <br/>
any Strongbad e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my thing with &quot;units&quot; is they never end until a person dies or <br/>
forgets to care (Alzheimers kind of brain-shut-down).  I might learn the best thing <br/>
ever about St. Francis or Eddie Izzard twenty years from now.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe I just see unschooling as the unit study of everything in the whole <br/>
wide world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a kid, my parents were told that gifted children tended to<br/>
naturally learn through immersing themselves fully in a subject, so they<br/>
didn&#39;t worry when I learned all about the Greek muses at eight or so<br/>
(inspired by the movie Xanadu with Olivia Newton John, I should point<br/>
out, although that probably didn&#39;t sound very gifted so it wasn&#39;t<br/>
mentioned) or learned all about how death was viewed in different<br/>
cultures at 10 (and by that year I was in a gifted pullout program every<br/>
Thursday and actually got to spend the whole day every week learning<br/>
about whatever I wanted).<br/>
<br/>
So when Rain wanted me to read The Odyssey to her at 3 and 4, in as many<br/>
different translations as I could find, it seemed like a pretty normal<br/>
thing to me. That&#39;s the kind of thing I had done, after all...<br/>
<br/>
Then, of course, I started hanging around with different kids, and it<br/>
seemed like an awful lot of them were learning through immersion, be it<br/>
pokemon cards or Jay-Z or gymnastics... some kids seemed to get into<br/>
things more thoroughly than others, I suppose, but it did seem that there<br/>
must be an awful lot of &quot;gifted&quot; kids running around.<br/>
<br/>
I think the original idea was backwards, actually. I think having the<br/>
freedom to learn about the things I wanted to learn about meant I was<br/>
more interested and enthusiastic about learning, and that translated in<br/>
the system as &quot;gifted&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that in the school system, the smarter the kids are supposed<br/>
to be, the more freedom they get over what they learn and how they learn<br/>
it. An awful lot of special ed is incredibly dull drill, and a lot of<br/>
gifted ed is open-ended and more free. It seems like rather a<br/>
self-fulfilling prophecy, IMO. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you&#39;re right.  I was actually thinking about that today. This <br/>
list will make you think! LOL!  I was in a gifted program all <br/>
through elementary.  I loved that class because it was the only <br/>
place where we got to do something of OUR choosing. Since there were <br/>
the same five kids in the class most years it wasn&#39;t hard to pick <br/>
what we wanted.  But it only lasted 40 minutes a day. Then we&#39;d <br/>
trudge back to regular class and I&#39;d pull out a book and read in <br/>
secret for the rest of the day.  Sad.  When I talked to my husband <br/>
about unschooling the only way I could explain it to him was that I <br/>
wanted my sons&#39; 40 minutes of enjoying what he&#39;s learning to last <br/>
his whole life!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Yes! I get family saying that my  kids are very bright, curious and intelligent,. Some call them gifted. I&#39;m sceptical. I think they simply get the freedom to cultivate those parts of themselves. They&#39;re allowed to explore so they stay curious. If they&#39;re gifted. it&#39;s because of their environment and it&#39;s something I think most kids are capable of. There was a line in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (movie) that always stuck with me. Buffy&#39;s boyfriend says something like, &quot;You&#39;re different then all the other girls I&#39;ve ever known,&quot; and Buffy replies, &quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot;<br/>
  I always took that to mean that she didn&#39;t think she was special, but she&#39;d simply had a chance to be more that most girls don&#39;t get. So my kids gifted? Naw, they just have the opportunity to be more.<br/>

Oh, wow.  A friend just lent us that this summer, while I was nursing <br/>
a lot and liked to have something on to keep me company.  I put it on <br/>
one afternoon and Fisher (6) came along and watched it with me.  It <br/>
was so fun to talk about St. Francis with him, but I had to keep my <br/>
own laughter down at the pure gimpy innocence of the movie.  Just <br/>
last week he mentioned the movie again -- I think I pointed out a St. <br/>
Francis statue to him, and he said, &quot;I know who that is -- we watched <br/>
that movie, renember [sic]?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gimpiest movie ever, but we loved it.<br/>

Yes, but it&#39;s early Zefferelli so some of it is Just Pure ART.  The scene <br/>
where he does a little sermon in the rain on the bricks in the courtyard of his <br/>
parents&#39; house is gorgeous nine ways.  The brickwork.  The lighting.  The <br/>
building.  The camera angles.  The words.  The rain.   Gosh.<br/>
<br/>
And when he gets well and goes out on the roof with the bird, in that long <br/>
white nightshirt...  that&#39;s not CGI.  That&#39;s real background, real buildings, <br/>
real every damned thing.<br/>
<br/>
The armor was goofy on purpose.  It was an anti-war movie probably as much as <br/>
it was anything else, but the images are still as good as renaissance <br/>
paintings when they&#39;re simpler and more natural.   When Bernardo and Francis are <br/>
sitting by the fire talking about stones and quarries, yeah they&#39;re in some ruin <br/>
of a building, and the set isn&#39;t fancied up like it would be really if it were <br/>
his house, but the lighting is still pretty breathtaking.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

I just found that out last night in a &quot;Videoflash&quot; catalog from Movies <br/>
Unlimited.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!!  If I didn&#39;t know already you&#39;d&#39;ve given me a primary thrill, but <br/>
I still liked the secondary thrill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I bought another copy of it on video *two weeks ago* but that&#39;s okay.  I <br/>
think we&#39;re getting a used van next week and it has a video player.    I could <br/>
stand to drive listening to that!<br/>

gotten used to the St. Francis interpretation, it was totally <br/>
absorbing -- the movie conjured up a vision you could lose yourself <br/>
in, if that makes sense.  The gimpy St. Francis was part of it -- you <br/>
had to cross a threshold.<br/>
<br/>
Might be talkin&#39; crazy,<br/>
