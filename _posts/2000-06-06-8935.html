<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was just talking about my intent to homeschool 
that you fill out at the local school district office.&nbsp; I am from 
Arkansas.&nbsp; I have already filled it out, but I filled it out as &quot;typical&quot; 
homeschooling, with classes, and hours, etc., although I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what 
I want to do.....sometimes when you say unschooling, you get funny looks, as I 
have already experienced.</font></div>
