BTW, on the issue of potty learning--DS is 2-1/2 and can use the potty when <br/>
he wants to, but usually his answer when asked is &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to.&quot; He <br/>
wants his diaper on to go. Wish I&#39;d known all of this when he was an infant. <br/>
Any suggestions? I am starting to let him run around w/o a diaper. Yesterday <br/>
he started to poop in the living room, then told me what he was doing. So I <br/>
took him into the potty and he did use it, but hasn&#39;t touched it again since <br/>
then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127886184">When my son was 2 ,I found that if he had diapers or training pants on he would go in them. If he was naked he would go potty. We had a couple of months that I let just him run around bottomless. I think they are more aware of it naked. It&#39;s worth a try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683934782">It has been my experience that 2 1/2 is on the youngish side for boys to<br/>
toilet themselves.  That 3 1/2 is more the average.  Just my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788518495">My two year old also goes in the potty if he is naked. The problem <br/>
is that he is not terribly fond of being naked. He likes to be all covered <br/>
up -- shirt and shorts at a minimum. Sometimes he&#39;ll sit on his potty if <br/>
someone else is going to the bathroom, and most of the time if we are out <br/>
someplace and a big person has to use the restroom he will use the toilet <br/>
without any problem. All I&#39;m doing now is asking him throughout the day if <br/>
he wants to go potty. The answer is almost invariably &quot;no,&quot; but I just keep <br/>
asking. Sooner or later he&#39;ll decide that the potty is the way to go.<br/>

still weaning off night time accidents, we&#39;re down to one every week or two. <br/>
he didn&#39;t even take an interest in the potty until about 3-4 months ago. when <br/>
he started really showing an interest, it seemed nudity was the best thing <br/>
for us. <br/>
