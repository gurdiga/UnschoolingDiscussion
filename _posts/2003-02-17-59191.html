I was just wondering this myself the other day.  Wondering what other<br/>
people did, not just during dark times, but all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I have Friday evenings for myself (most of them), I go to my dad&#39;s<br/>
office (he&#39;s a Dr. with a huge reception area).  Sometimes friends join<br/>
me, sometimes it&#39;s just me.  I listen to music, visit with my friends<br/>
and we paint, sew (I keep an extra sewing machine there), work in the<br/>
darkroom, etc...  I make cloth art dolls and spend quite a bit of that<br/>
time doing hand sewing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to have a hard time with it, but he knows me better now<br/>
and understands that I need to have quiet time just for me (ok,<br/>
sometimes with friends).  Without that time I can get really grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to make it to the gym 3 days a week, the kids play in the<br/>
kids gym and I get a good workout.  The other two days we take long<br/>
walks together.<br/>
<br/>
This is how I calm myself, without it my life would feel like chaos (not<br/>
that it really is, I just like peace and quiet - and it isn&#39;t quiet here<br/>
most of the time - lol).<br/>

&gt; I enjoy playing music on my clarinet or keyboard. I also listen to may<br/>
types of music . Dancing around while cleaining. This can really help  get<br/>
me motivated to get on with the day .Tickling the kids or horsing around.<br/>
Light candles and play classical music while kids play and just watch them.<br/>
Just pamper yourself with a facial or bath. A Walk taking in the nature<br/>
around you. I recently picked up a poetry collection but I cant remember the<br/>
name. I can check. I have found Tina Mc Bride an american country singer<br/>
song &quot;I have Been Blessed&quot; an inspiration when have hard time dealing with<br/>
been a mother and played it at  the end of my wedding ceromony this summer. </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>When things get cranky or frazzled, I turn on the music and get a little <br/>
funky-thang goin&#39; on.  Dance around the kitchen, sing really loudly (and <br/>
off-key usually)...  If I need to tune out the world for a while, I read a <br/>
book, usually sci-fi with a bit of lovin&#39; in it.<br/>
<br/>
When things are Really Frazzled, I used to do &#39;spa-things&#39;, but nowadays I <br/>
take off alone in my 4xtruck to our &#39;land&#39; in the middle of <br/>
absolutely-nowhere and get some work done.  Usually without the kids and <br/>
only one dog for some real decompression.  Better than any spa I&#39;ve ever <br/>
been to.  Dig ditches, haul rocks and parts of trees, work on the culverts, <br/>
putter around a little more with the foundation/s... basically wear my <br/>
muscles right out, convert some adipose tissue to muscle, revel in the <br/>
silence (and it&#39;s tremendously silent out there in the middle of nowhere) <br/>
visit the trees to see who&#39;s fallen since I saw them last and stare at the <br/>
veritable cloud of stars from the outhouse (which lost its door in the last <br/>
big storm because I hadn&#39;t latched it properly.)<br/>
<br/>
3 or 4 days of silence so full that you can hear the frogs 10 or 12 acres <br/>
away, and I&#39;m ready for civilization again.  Ah, sanity... Sigh.... now <br/>
you&#39;ve got me itching to get back out there again!!!<br/>

Someday I&#39;ll have little cabins &#39;nooked&#39; into the land so friends and other <br/>
homeschoolers can come and chill out too.  ...part of the dream, anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I can&#39;t get out of the house I put on music - Pink Floyd, Marley, Bohinta, Eurythmics. Anything I can sing along too and dance too. It breaks up all the negaticity.<br/>
If I can escape (DH home) then I get on my bicycle and cycle 10-40 miles depending on how much time I&#39;ve got. I always feel great after a ride.<br/>
Back home I would walk to the top of the Malvern Hills at top speed and scream. They are so beautiful and the view is spectacular that its impossible to remain frazzled. Boy do I miss my hills.<br/>
