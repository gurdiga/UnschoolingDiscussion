<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, in reality, spiders are not even insects; they are in the same phylae<br/>
&gt; (or is it genus, or something?  I can never remember) as crabs and<br/>
&gt; lobsters.  So I believe you&#39;re probably technically correct; although I am<br/>
&gt; not familiar with exactly which of the particualr name-brands of crabs are<br/>
&gt; the largest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Roly-poly bugs or Pill bugs (the ones that live in basements, under porches <br/>
or any cool damp place. They roll up if touched. The kids have a blast making <br/>
them do that!) are also related to lobsters and are technically not insects <br/>
but crustaceans. Daddy Long Legs are not really spiders either. I have heard <br/>
different people say that Daddy Long Legs have some of the most poisonous <br/>
venom known to man but since their jaws are so small and not strong enough, <br/>
they couldn&#39;t even bite a human, though I have not seen documented proof on <br/>
this claim.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have giant ones! Almost an inch long and almost as fat as a #2 pencil. We <br/>
have bunches of little ones too, but the big ones scare me. A book I read <br/>
said they live for years, molting every few months... ewwww. I just don&#39;t <br/>
like bugs and Jack drags home every book he finds and loves to find the <br/>
nastiest, uckiest buggers to drop in front of me! <br/>
He found one particular specimen hanging on our screen door this morning. It <br/>
is something I have never seen and is currently in one of those miniature <br/>
plastic aquariums with the ventilated lid, sitting on our kitchen window <br/>
sill. If Dad doesn&#39;t know what it is, and an exhaustive search of our many <br/>
bug books earlier turned up nothing (?!) we are going to take it to Washburn <br/>
or KU. It looks like a cross between a praying mantis, a roach, and a <br/>
grasshopper. It is really long, (three and one half to four inches?) has <br/>
wings, huge mandibles, (looks like it could chop a finger in half!) that <br/>
stick out from its head looking like giant pinchers. All in all, it is one <br/>
nasty looking dude, I cannot wait to get it Out-Of-My-House!!! <br/>
~Nancy~ who went to bed with the heebie-jeebies and woke up with a giant one <br/>
in her face! :O<br/>

<br/>
There are some big scary bugs named after the plants their moms tend to want <br/>
to eat.  I can&#39;t remember what ended up being the scariest one I ever saw, <br/>
but it was named after some tree around us. And it was big and looked like <br/>
some 11 year old boy had made it up, doodling monster-bugs.<br/>
<br/>
But look at the ugliness of squash bugs, potato bugs, and tomato worms! <br/>
Whatever he is, I bet he&#39;s named after something pretty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
