<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909304394"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m all for being as polite as possible to strangers, and there is  a<br/>
&gt; basic level of respect that all people deserve, *especially* if you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know  the person, because otherwise you&#39;re just judging them on appearance or<br/>
&gt; them  having a bad day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t automatically give respect, I&#39;m obviously of the &quot;needs to be<br/>
earned mentality&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m automatically judging<br/>
people in negative<br/>
ways either.  <br/>
<br/>
Respect is obviously shown in different ways in different places.  <br/>
Just what  concept of respect people have seems to be different as<br/>
well.  Even among<br/>
fellow unschoolers.  :-) <br/>
