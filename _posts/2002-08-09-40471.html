<br/>
This is something I&#39;ve never understood. How does one separate the message <br/>
Jesus came to tell, from the words the Bible says he used? Words that to me, <br/>
at least, are less than comforting half the time. <br/>
<br/>
The greatest filterer of Jesus&#39; words may have been Thomas Jefferson. He <br/>
separated Jesus the ethicist from Jesus the metaphysician and miracle worker. <br/>
After having done that, I don&#39;t think TJ would ever have considered calling <br/>
himself a Christian, not because he didn&#39;t follow Jesus&#39; ethical teachings, <br/>
but because he knew orthodoxy from heterodoxy, and realized that he was in <br/>
the latter camp, as were Franklin, Paine, Adams, and some others, and being <br/>
no democrat, didn&#39;t think that 1800 years of orthodoxy should change just for <br/>
him. [Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I truly know of no place where <br/>
Jefferson called himself a Christian. A follower of Christ? Yes. But not a <br/>
Christian.]<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Though he wasn&#39;t a Unitarian officially, Thomas Jefferson wrote somewhere<br/>
that he identified most closely with Joseph Priestly&#39;s Unitarian church. He<br/>
lived too far and the only church nearby was the Episcopalian one.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I stumbled on Thomas Jefferson&#39;s like the Unitarian church I found<br/>
some more polished entries, but these are interesting nonetheless:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary (1952) includes in the definition of<br/>
Deist: &quot;One who believes in God but denies supernatural revelation.&quot; There<br/>
is no question Jefferson rejected the Bible as divine revelation and<br/>
rejected the divinity of Jesus. In the Declaration of Independence<br/>
Jefferson&#39;s appeal was to the God of the Deist, &quot;Nature&#39;s God,&quot; not<br/>
specifically to the God of Christianity (see letter dated Sep. 14, 1813, to<br/>
Jefferson from John Adams equating &quot;Nature&#39;s God&quot; with &quot;the revelation from<br/>
nature&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
As President, Jefferson occasionally attended church services; but, he was<br/>
not a communing member of any Christian church. Further, he refused to<br/>
proclaim any national days of prayer or thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Jefferson says he was a &quot;Materialist&quot; (letter to Short, Apr. 13, 1820) and a<br/>
&quot;Unitarian&quot; (letter to Waterhouse, Jan. 8, 1825). Jefferson rejected the<br/>
Christian doctrine of the &quot;Trinity&quot; (letter to Derieux, Jul. 25, 1788), as<br/>
well as the doctrine of an eternal Hell (letter to Van der Kemp, May 1,<br/>
1817). Further, Jefferson specifically named Joseph Priestly (English<br/>
Unitarian who moved to America) and Conyers Middleton (English Deist) and<br/>
said: &quot;I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith&quot; (letter to Adams,<br/>
Aug. 22, 1813). Therefore, without using the actual words, Jefferson issued<br/>
an authentic statement claiming Deism as his faith. The 1971 (ninth edition)<br/>
Encyclopedia Britannica, 7:183, states the following: &quot;By the end of the<br/>
18th century deism had become a dominant religious attitude among<br/>
upper-class Americans, and the first three presidents of the United States<br/>
held this conviction, as is amply evidenced in their correspondence.&quot;<br/>

Atheist! Infidel! Jacobin! Jefferson&#39;s political enemies were crucifying<br/>
him. It was the fall of 1799 and Vice President Jefferson was running for<br/>
President of the United States of America. One of his greatest political<br/>
opponents, the Federalist Alexander Hamilton, had set the tone of the<br/>
campaign by using the epithet &quot;atheist&quot;, among others, to label their great<br/>
antagonist, Thomas Jefferson.<br/>
<br/>
One outraged cleric issued The Voice of Warning to Christians, on the<br/>
ensuing election of a President of the United States. He cried<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This election is not a choice between individuals or policy, but is<br/>
infintely more, of national regard or disregard to the religion of Jesus<br/>
Chris. Will the people choose Jefferson, a confirmed infidel? Read in his<br/>
infamous publicatin Notes on Virginia, of his disbelief in the Deluge, in<br/>
his disbelief in the story of Adam and Eve, and of his statement that &#39;It<br/>
does me no injury for my neighbors to say there are twenty Gods or no God.&#39;<br/>
Christians, if you value eternity, vote against this infidel! By voting for<br/>
him, you will do more to destroy the Gospel of Jesus Christ than the rest of<br/>
the whole fraternity of infidels with all their arts, their industry, and<br/>
their intrigues.&quot; <br/>
Another minister wrote, &quot;I do not believe that the Most High will permit a<br/>
howling atheist to site at the head of this nation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A newspaper, the New England Palladium, was even worse. It thundered<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of<br/>
death will be on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and<br/>
some infamous prostitute, under the title of the Goddess of Resaon, will<br/>
preside in our sanctuaries, which are now devoted to worship of our Most<br/>
High.&quot; <br/>
