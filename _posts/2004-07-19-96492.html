&gt; cure<br/>
&gt; fear&quot;. Boy is that ever an idea whose time has never been! She may <br/>
&gt; also<br/>
&gt; benefit from some of the ideas about not calling children names.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the link, Robyn.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to find something<br/>
there.  She used to do the same thing with me (and DH&#39;s mom with him). <br/>
It&#39;s something we&#39;re both really sensitive about.  DH and I are both<br/>
going to have to get more stern about these things.  After all, if they<br/>
were hurting our children physically we would put a stop to it right<br/>
away, so why should we treat emotional pain any differently?<br/>

&gt; shouldn&#39;t well bye now&quot; and hang up. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This made me laugh because Lena & Liberty had never been interested in<br/>
writing their own names until just very recently as a way to claim<br/>
ownership over their art work (sick of me constantly saying, &quot;Who drew<br/>
this?&quot;)  Instead, they wanted to know how to write &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Wendy.&quot;  Drove the grandparents *crazy* to get stuff from them signed<br/>
Peter Pan and Wendy.  I did have to let them know that they wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
receiving anymore &quot;gifts&quot; from the kids unless they could keep their<br/>
negative comments (&quot;It&#39;s nice, but why didn&#39;t you write your name?&quot;) to<br/>
themselves.  My constant cheerful refrain is, &quot;Well, when I want them to<br/>
feel bad about themselves for not being ready to learn/do something, then<br/>
I&#39;ll put them in school!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

are people who have never been afraid of anything in their lives.  There<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be any compassion for kids who are fearful of certain<br/>
things; they&#39;re supposed to just get over it.  <br/>

Huh.<br/>
Maybe if they&#39;re not careful you&#39;ll build up to <br/>
