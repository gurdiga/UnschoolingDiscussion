 </span></blockquote>I did talk with Jackson last night.  Showed him the posts and asked him what <br/>
he thought, as we haven&#39;t discussed it in a very long time.  He said first <br/>
off he thought it was funny that we would be talking about dirty laundry.  <br/>
LOL.  But seriously...he said he did not feel controlled or ruled.  He said <br/>
he has developed a system and does not want me to go through his clothes.  He <br/>
said he knows which are clean and which are dirty and when they are Dirty <br/>
enough they will get into the basket.  He says if I wash his dress clothes <br/>
too much the pants will start to wear out at the pockets very fast.  And he <br/>
keeps his &quot;working outside&quot; clothes for quite a while before he washes them.  <br/>
LOL.  He says he has plenty of time to separate his clothes and just <br/>
appreciates that I don&#39;t mind doing the laundry as he hates it. He likes it <br/>
like it is.<br/>
<br/>
So we ended it there and went to bed.<br/>

I&#39;ve always done two washes. One is whites and near whites, the other, everything else. Oh, and when I have a baby in nappies, they are washed seperately cos they require the hottest wash.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never get this house-wife thing figured out ;-)<br/>

<br/>
We run all-black loads.  And never right after an all-white load, to avoid <br/>
lint.<br/>
<br/>
We all have lots of black clothes.  <br/>
<br/>
If there are lots of colored clothes, I&#39;ll separate darks from lights, to <br/>
keep the red stuff from pinkening other stuff.  Or just for fun.  Or just <br/>
because I don&#39;t know how else to make two loads from a two-load-sized pile <br/>
without sorting them SOMEhow.  <br/>

LOL!! Actually not necessary, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing just fine. It&#39;s just the<br/>
way &quot;I&quot; do it. Even my mom, a pretty anal housekeeper herself thinks my way<br/>
is funny. It&#39;s just that I have so much laundry to do in a week that&#39;s it&#39;s<br/>
much easier this way for me to see what gets done and what may really need<br/>
done right now instead of tomorrow. All of Tara&#39;s work shirts are red and if<br/>
I keep reds/oranges/ pinks/purples together, I can see when the basket is<br/>
full, it needs done as she&#39;ll need a shirt. Just something I do to make<br/>
things run smoother here.<br/>
