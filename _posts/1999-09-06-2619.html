&lt;&lt; You know, I read this, and the rest of your response, and I think that is <br/>
so <br/>
 great.  But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in <br/>
 the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up <br/>
in <br/>
 the morning?   &gt;&gt;<br/>

I wasn&#39;t the original  poster here, but I want to respond.  First of all, I <br/>
truly  understand your frustration because I&#39;ve been in a similar spot...and <br/>
not that long ago.  I just couldn&#39;t figure out &quot;how to make it work.&quot;  It all <br/>
sounded so good, and theoretically I believed unschooling could work...but <br/>
how to implement it with my own kids stymied me.  <br/>
And I&#39;ve  had many days where I just let them play Legos or whatever and they <br/>
would end up fighting a lot and being bored, and I would think...how in <br/>
tarnation can this possibly work?<br/>
Here are some things that are helping me at this point in the process.  I <br/>
finally came to the realization that I  always felt like we had to be &quot;doing <br/>
something.&quot;  Like I had to define every activity as being worthwhile or not.  <br/>
And I realized that because of this thinking, I was actually blocking some of <br/>
the natural learning that might have come out of these activities from <br/>
happening.<br/>
But, I felt I needed something concrete...something tangible.<br/>
So, this is what I&#39;m doing...<br/>
When I was in college, I dated a musician and one of the things that he <br/>
always did was to carry a small notebook in his pocket, so that whenever he <br/>
would think of something, or read a neat quote or hear something he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to forget, or just be inspired by nature, he would immediately jot it <br/>
down.  This really helped him write lyrics later on.<br/>
I went on to become a journalist and I copied this technique.<br/>
Well, it struck me one day that this would really help us with our <br/>
unschooling.  Because so much of the time my kids would say something during <br/>
lunch or Lego play or they&#39;d ask a question and we would just forget it or <br/>
not get around to it.<br/>
So, now, I carry my little pocket notebook around and write these things down <br/>
and then when we get to a lull, I will pull out this notebook and we&#39;ll start <br/>
talking about whatever it was that we wrote down.  If the kids are <br/>
enthusiastic about it, we pursue it, but if they aren&#39;t we pretty much just <br/>
drop it.  <br/>
This might sound simplistic, but it has really helped me, because I felt like <br/>
my kids were really struggling with &quot;what to do&quot; as much as I was.  I <br/>
consider this a tool of &quot;deschooling,&quot; and hope that eventually,  these <br/>
activities will just naturally flow.  But, for now, this has really helped us.<br/>
I&#39;ll give you a for example situation, in case this isn&#39;t concrete enough.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yo son came home from his friend&#39;s house last weekend and they had put <br/>
together and launched a model rocket.  My son wanted to do that, too.  So, I <br/>
didn&#39;t have time right then, but I wrote it in the book.  Later on that week, <br/>
when they were struggling looking for something to do, I brought up the <br/>
rocket and he was immediately excited.  He took his lawn mowing money and <br/>
went to the store and bought a kit with his Dad and put it together that <br/>
night.  The next a.m., he went onto the NASA site on the computer and went to <br/>
the library and read and checked out a ton of books about rocketry.  We <br/>
pulled out my older daughter&#39;s old physical science book and talked about <br/>
acceleration/distance formulas and figured some of them out.  This didn&#39;t <br/>
turn him off at all.  He even struggled to do some of the Math himself.  That <br/>
night, the kids wanted to watch Apollo 13 on video that they got at the <br/>
library, so my dh and I watched with them.  Yesterday, my brother came over <br/>
and talked about how he built rockets as a kid and used a car battery to <br/>
launch them. So now Michael wants to try using different power sources to <br/>
launch his rocket.  I wrote that down in the notebook and we&#39;ll get to it the <br/>
next time we have a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the notebook entries are duds.  I bring up the subject and the kids <br/>
just drop it.  But a lot of times, they seem like just the starter the kids <br/>
and I both need.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.   I didn&#39;t share this so you would necessarily feel <br/>
like you had to do it yourselves, but just to show you that there are many <br/>
ways to help ourselves get through the process.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, be patient with yourself.  It doesn&#39;t take shape overnight!  <br/>
After all, most of us were raised with the school mentality ourselves.  And <br/>
all of us are learning as we go and doing, as David said, whatever works that <br/>
day!<br/>
Take care...glad you&#39;re asking questions!<br/>

Thanks so much for sharing, I am keeping everyone&#39;s&#39; responses, and am going <br/>
to make a little note book to help me!  I just happen to have an empty little <br/>
note book right now to put in my pocket! thanks<br/>
