<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819728019">I LOVE Monty Python and the Holy Grail. <br/>
FAVORITE MOVIE: The Princess Bride. <br/>
CLOSE SECOND: A Knight&#39;s Tale (the dance scene in Knight&#39;s Tale is my <br/>
favorite movie scene, bar none) <br/>
An interesting one, which  could lead to some very interesting <br/>
discussion: Pleasantville. <br/>
I also loved (and am looking to buy) &quot;Babette&#39;s Feast&quot; It touched me <br/>
deeper than just about any movie I&#39;ve ever seen. It has a profound <br/>
message about life, gratitude, physical pleasure, service, sacrifice. <br/>
VERY good.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about Netflix. Is this the service where you have a certain <br/>
number of movies available per month? My hubby thought it looked <br/>
pretty good, if that&#39;s what it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126832491">The Princess Bride was the very first DVD we bought. Had to replace our very <br/>
worn out copy of TPB on tape.<br/>
A Knight&#39;s Tale and Babette&#39;s Feast will go on our list!<br/>
And yes it is the company you are thinking about. 19.95 per month, no postal <br/>
fees, they send you an envelope for mailing. We got the first two weeks free.<br/>

<br/>
IF you watch the DVDs and send them right back it&#39;s a great deal! <br/>
If you keep them a week or two, it becomes no better than renting at <br/>
Hollywood, except for the fact that they have some obscure stuff the local <br/>
shop won&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
It would be PERFECT for families who don&#39;t live near town, because it&#39;s just <br/>
mailbox and back.<br/>
<br/>
We mailed three back today.  Not ideal.  That means we&#39;ll get three new ones <br/>
at once.  Someone who&#39;s organized and can stagger the return will do best.<br/>

<br/>
You can pay more to have more DVDs in the swirl, if you want them more often.<br/>
