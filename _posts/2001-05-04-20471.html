<h4>Dennis/Laurie Brown</h4>
<p><small><time> 5 May 2001, at  5:32pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051304511">We use the name Brownville Academy as our &#39;school&#39; name when it seems<br/>
helpful.  Like when we first move to a new location (we move a LOT) and<br/>
everyone asks DS where he goes to school.  He used to say &#39;I don&#39;t go to<br/>
school&#39; but I had a hard time with all the questions that raised.  I simply<br/>
don&#39;t have the energy to answer all the busy bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Now he says something like &#39;Brownville Academy&#39;.   Which usually leads to a<br/>
comment about never hearing of that school and he responds that it&#39;s a very<br/>
exclusive school...so exclusive that he&#39;s the only student!...and tells them<br/>
he homeschools.  From there we either get responses or questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found the whole exchange to be much more pleasant since we started<br/>
doing this.  Those folks that assume homeschool means school at home also<br/>
assume we have a rigorous academic schedule and very high standards and they<br/>
are satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Others who are interested in what home education is like will ask questions<br/>
and are usually jealous.  (It still amazes me how many people give me the &#39;I<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand to be around my children that many hours&#39; type of comment.<br/>
My response to that is that I&#39;m a jealous mom.  I like my child and love to<br/>
be with him!)<br/>
<br/>
It has also been helpful to have a school name when requesting information<br/>
or discounts.  With computers so available, it&#39;s really easy to create<br/>
letterhead, for instance.  When we first began homeschooling, I would have<br/>
had to get letterhead printed.  Now, just run it off the computer as<br/>
needed...not that it&#39;s needed very often, but it&#39;s a nice tool.<br/>
<br/>
Starting to ramble...sorry.<br/>
