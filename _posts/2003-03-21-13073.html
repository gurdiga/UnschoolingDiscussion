<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391788190">A friend sent this to me two weeks ago and I still haven&#39;t looked.  I&#39;m <br/>
cleaning out my e-mail box and also see that during the four days I was off <br/>
in Saskatoon at least three people joined this list, and though I kept <br/>
meaning to go back and read those days there was a bunch of writing, and I <br/>
still haven&#39;t caught up.<br/>
<br/>
This is more interesting that that, I&#39;m sure (and the quote starts):<br/>
<br/>
In the summer of 2002 the well preserved remains of a mediaeval ship were <br/>
discovered during excavation works for a new Arts Centre on the banks of the <br/>
River Usk in central Newport (UK). It is one of the most complete examples of <br/>
a ship believed to have been built circa 1465. <br/>
<br/>
The Friends of the Newport Ship has today launched a new website which I <br/>
think you will find of interest. It is full of fascinating information about <br/>
the ship, photos and details about the association and member activities.<br/>
 <br/>
Please visit and let us know  what you think - we would also appreciate it if <br/>
you mail round details to any others that you think may be interested. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711936589">This is very interesting and I&#39;ve been reading there now for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sending this.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me, in that round about way of things, of a song my Aunt Eula<br/>
use to sing &quot;The Keel Row.&quot;<br/>
This ship wasn&#39;t a Keel, but I have that whole Welsh seafaring thing<br/>
happening now.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As I came through Sandgate, through Sandgate, through Sandgate,<br/>
As I came through Sandgate, I heard a lassie sing -<br/>
<br/>
Oh weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,<br/>
Weel may the keel row, that my laddie&#39;s in.<br/>
<br/>
He wears a blue bonnet, blue bonnet, blue bonnet,<br/>
He wears a blue bonnet, an&#39; a dimple on his chin -<br/>
<br/>
Oh, weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,<br/>
Weel may the keel row that my laddie&#39;s in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was more, but I don&#39;t remember how the rest goes.  <br/>

I&#39;ve never known anyone else with that name either.   <br/>
Is your great-aunt Welsh?<br/>
My Aunt was Eula Gwynnlyn Morgan.   I miss her, she was tall and dark and<br/>
beautiful and sweet and always singing.<br/>

sure where my grandmother&#39;s family came from.  I doubt any of them would even <br/>
remember at this point.  <br/>
