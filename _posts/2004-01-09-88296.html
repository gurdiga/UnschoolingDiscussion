<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754337795">Hi, I&#39;m a 17 yrs young student at a public high school. It&#39;s been <br/>
boring me out of my mind most of the day and I feel I&#39;m not learning <br/>
anything relevant to what I want to do. I&#39;ve introduced my parents <br/>
to unschooling, maybe not in the best manner - but I tried. It turns <br/>
out they don&#39;t trust me to learn on my own, making me doubt my own <br/>
abilities. I really would love to start but have no idea where to <br/>
start.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I feel like a poot, but if you&#39;re a senior in high school, I think at this <br/>
point you should just finish it out.<br/>
<br/>
But also find a copy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook, and read online <br/>
whatever you find that looks good with google.com looking up auto-didactic, <br/>
because I think that&#39;s the direction you want to head.  <br/>
<br/>
If you keep reading about unschooling you&#39;ll keep hearing moms talk about <br/>
their little kids, but if you look up &quot;auto-didactic&quot; you&#39;ll find lots of young <br/>
adults who can give you ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please, no matter what you decide to do as far as schooling do not doubt your <br/>
own abilities. I lived that way for far too long and it&#39;s a waste of time. <br/>
Ability to me relates to having courage to be who you are, please do try to be <br/>
all of who you are! It takes courage to trust that we can do that which we <br/>
think we can especially when what we want to do scares others. Those of us who <br/>
march to a different drummer can scare a lot of people who will in turn do all <br/>
they can to get us back in the band...don&#39;t go!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681632591">If by chance you are in California, you could leave high school and <br/>
just go straight to a community college. The semester is JUST starting. <br/>
That&#39;s an option that several high school kids I know have used, <br/>
including my nephew - to get themselves out of spending any further <br/>
time absolutely miserable in high school.  This may be possible in some <br/>
other states, as well, but not everywhere.<br/>
