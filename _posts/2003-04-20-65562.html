<div id="ygrps-yiv-716084137">I have found it quite unschoolish.    They refer to unschooling quite a bit and self-directed learning.   I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed reading the articles.  <br/>
<br/>
**I got sent a sample copy** <br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know,  was this a while ago?     I&#39;ve had my subscription for about a year now.       They have had quite a few articles written by unschooled young adults; which I have really enjoyed reading.   Last issue also had an article by David Albert in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086797203">The only &quot;schooly&quot; thing in the magazine that I saw were some ads for <br/>
curriculums.  The articles are definitely NOT schooly!  I absolutely <br/>
love the magazine! <br/>
<br/>
What about it did you find too schooly? <br/>

You surely must be thinking of a different magazine.<br/>
It&#39;s all about natural learning/unschooling. That&#39;s the whole focus.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will try it again then, thanks for the imput.  I looked it over and I can<br/>
tell the overall feel is unschooling- just one article was pretty offensive<br/>
to me, and another I had to hold back writing a letter about (not &quot;bad&quot;, I<br/>
feel like that allot).<br/>
<br/>
BUT that is where, in the letters section, I read about this baby bike seat<br/>
I had been looking for for 15 years!!  (I had only seen something like it in<br/>
*really* old mothering magazine home adds, and could never find one)  I<br/>
ordered it instantly.<br/>

OOH!  it is SO, SO neat!<br/>
