Oh man back to this.  We HAVE come full circle haven&#39;t we Bridget?  When you<br/>
are using Wyndham as an example as to why rules and structure and, to use<br/>
your term, &quot;school&quot; is important, it would be helpful if you pointed out to<br/>
new people on the list that you have described Wyndham as having a quite<br/>
significant mental disorder.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing about unschooling and rules gets bogged down in the<br/>
language.  For many people, the idea of rules means something like &quot;We eat<br/>
dinner at 6:00.  If you are not in your place at 6:00 sharp you will not<br/>
eat.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the kittens are being born, the scrabble game<br/>
isn&#39;t finished, etc. 6:00 means 6:00 mister&quot;.  In other words, something<br/>
rigid and arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
For others, rules means something like &quot;We normally eat at 6:00 but last<br/>
night it was more like 7:00.  The cat was having kittens and it was such an<br/>
amazing experience for the entire family.  The kids had made a warm bed for<br/>
the cat and after she gave birth they oohed and aaahed and we talked about<br/>
when they were born.  After awhile, Pete said he was hungry and we all<br/>
agreed.&quot;  In other words, guidelines that are flexible and pliable.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have things they are responsible for but I rarely REQUIRE anything<br/>
specific of them.  We all, as a family, talk about our needs to each other.<br/>
I need to be able to find all the dirty clothes for laundry.  Zach hates to<br/>
clean his room and likes to live amid his.......belongings.  It made me<br/>
crazy to have to dig through all his stuff to find clothes.  Zach and I<br/>
TALKED about it.  He suggested doing his own laundry.  It is working out<br/>
great.  If we are going somewhere that he needs something particular to<br/>
wear, I ask him the day before if it is clean.<br/>
<br/>
All families have rules even if they are unspoken ones.  In our home, it is<br/>
to treat others like you would like to be treated, to act humanely and<br/>
respectfully to each other.<br/>
<br/>
TV--<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a big TV limiter.  It was turned off daily from 9 to 5 no<br/>
matter what.  Then at 5 the kids would be glued to the thing and I could get<br/>
dinner cooked without interruption.  One year ago, we did away with all the<br/>
limits.  The kids went nuts, spending literally hours and hours watching<br/>
television.  They watched somethings that I had cautioned them against and<br/>
got scared.  They watched some stuff that I cautioned against and got bored.<br/>
Now they watch television less, by choice, than they did when I limited it<br/>
(when I limited it we had 10 channels, we now have over 900).  You can only<br/>
watch so many Spongebob Squarepants reruns before going outside seems more<br/>
interesting.  They also monitor their own content.  The kids will say they<br/>
don&#39;t want to watch something because it seems scary.  They even have<br/>
potential access to erotica due to pay per view and have never watched it<br/>
(it would show up on the bill).<br/>
<br/>
I think it is easy to not give kids credit to make their own decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515525556">Not really full circle, because this time, I&#39;m not going to let anyone <br/>
try to tell me we are wrong to do what we have for him.  In the 8 <br/>
months that have passed since I joined here, something very <br/>
interesting has happened with him.  Back in September, the only part <br/>
of his day that was structured, was the part at my mother&#39;s house.  He <br/>
had to go there when she was available.  Since then, he has pretty <br/>
much structured the entire rest of his time on his own.  We had <br/>
discussions about  his TV viewing and why he felt the need to watch <br/>
all day and he has since picked out which shows he really wants to see <br/>
and which not.  Now he goes back to grandma&#39;s for those shows.  His <br/>
whole day is kind of mapped out timewise now.  <br/>
We have done away with the Nintendo64 too.  That was not his idea but <br/>
was done with his understanding and approval.<br/>
<br/>
And an odd thing has happened, some of his OCD behaviours <br/>
have lessened.  His overall health is improving and he is much calmer <br/>
and less likely to have a tantrum now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which of the factors above played a part in his <br/>
improvement and he still has lots of problems, but I am absolutely <br/>
certain he is doing exactly what he wants to be doing right now.<br/>

ps - Oh and by the way, please do not refer to my son as having a <br/>
significant mental disorder.  He may be a bit unusual, but I&#39;m not <br/>
willing to label him that way ever.<br/>
