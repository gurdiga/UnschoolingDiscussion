It&#39;s from  www.drscience.com<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
Dear Doctor Science,<br/>
In the &quot;New Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; a statement is made that<br/>
the Clarinet plays (or acts) as a stopped-pipe resonator. It actually<br/>
sounds an octave lower than one would expect. It is similar in length to<br/>
a flute or soprano sax but sounds an octave lower. Can you explain why<br/>
the clarinet sounds as a stopped-pipe as opposed to the flute or sax<br/>
which sound as open pipes?<br/>

As anyone who&#39;s ever heard Prokoviev&#39;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; knows, the<br/>
clarinet is actually a fossilized cat. Flutes are fossilized birds.<br/>
Some birds are as big as cats, but they&#39;re still birds and therefore<br/>
make a comparatively high pitched or, scientifically speaking, &quot;Tweaty&quot;<br/>
noise compared to a clarinet, or cat. The term &quot;stopped pipe&quot; refers to<br/>
a bird caught in the cat&#39;s throat. Probably the cat was nabbed by<br/>
instrument makers before he could finish chewing his meal. They make<br/>
most musical instruments in other countries, where there are no animal<br/>
protection laws.</div>
