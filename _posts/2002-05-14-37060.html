<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617902202">I used to have to keep records for the province that we lived in.  I <br/>
made an outline of the various subject areas and put it on a <br/>
clipboard.  Each week I would write in library books read, Cricket <br/>
articles read, reading alone, writing, math activities, PBS shows, <br/>
field trips, physical exercise, musical and other learning <br/>
experiences we would have together.  I would enter this weekly onto <br/>
an outline on our computer and then every six months just print and <br/>
mail!  It was kind of impressive when it got compiled that way.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as grade levels, you could get one of those world book <br/>
outlines or some other such thing of what kids &quot;need to know&quot; at each <br/>
grade level and just check them off.  <br/>
<br/>
I only do what is required by the state that I live in... I know what <br/>
my kids know and they often know more than me!</div>
