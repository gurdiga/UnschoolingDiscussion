<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656322348"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Since this list is not moderated in any way, the only recourse we have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; the constant snipping between two people is to point out what I point out to<br/>
&gt;&gt; my children.  It takes two to tango.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll leave, because it&#39;s pretty apparent that two people have interest in <br/>
&gt;little else than belittling me.  If I&#39;m to be equated with them I&#39;d rather <br/>
&gt;they just have the whole deal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why anyone should leave. Or need a moderator.<br/>
<br/>
These things have a way of running their course. Just let it run out of <br/>
gas. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some great opinions and some heavy topics on the board here, <br/>
don&#39;t let the natural flow of conversation (all kinds) get castrated.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO,<br/>
