THE DAY HOMESCHOOLING DIES<br/>
Email | 21 Oct 03 | Chis Davis<br/>
Posted on 10/21/2003 7:15 PM EDT by SLB<br/>
My oldest son, Seth, was homeschooled the entire time he lived at home.<br/>
This past summer, as he and I were discussing his upbringing, I had a<br/>
realization about this movement we all call &quot;homeschooling,&quot; and I said<br/>
to Seth, &quot;When you have kids, they will not be public schooled. They<br/>
won&#39;t be private schooled. They won&#39;t be Christian schooled.&quot; <br/>
&quot;And,&quot; I concluded, &quot;your kids won&#39;t be home schooled, either.&quot; <br/>
The realization I had while talking with Seth is that God had begun<br/>
something twenty years ago that came to be called &quot;homeschooling,&quot; but<br/>
which really wasn t about schooling at all. Here&#39;s what I mean. <br/>
THE COLLAPSE OF THE FAMILY <br/>
For thousands of years children have grown up in what today would be<br/>
considered an unnatural place—the home. In this setting, parents never<br/>
thought of themselves as &quot;home schoolers.&quot; There was no alternative to<br/>
children spending their days at home, having knowledge, experiences and<br/>
character passed to them by their parents and extended family. What<br/>
children needed to know, they learned as part of their daily lives:<br/>
sowing and reaping, weather, how a business works, how to treat customers<br/>
(and everyone else, for that matter). Life was their education. <br/>
Throughout history, small, homogeneous groups have attempted to provide a<br/>
common education for their youth, yet it wasn’t until around the mid<br/>
1800&#39;s that entire nations decided to take children out of the home and<br/>
&quot;school&quot; them. I will briefly mention the two main causes for this<br/>
<br/>
dramatic change in the way we began raising our children. Interestingly,<br/>
both occurred at approximately the same time. <br/>
First, in the mid-1800’s the Industrial Revolution began. The new<br/>
factories needed laborers and the siren call went out for men to leave<br/>
their homes and be paid a salary (something new for most men). The<br/>
possibility of being able to increase one’s family&#39;s standard of living<br/>
was the draw that caused men to cease being patriarchs of a family<br/>
enterprise and become employees. <br/>
Around this same time, another movement was taking shape: The Common<br/>
(Public) School movement. The leaders of the Public School movement were,<br/>
for the most part, humanists who were concerned about two things they<br/>
believed endangered America’s future: The continuation of what they<br/>
called religious superstitious beliefs and the influx of illiterate<br/>
immigrants seeking jobs and a better life in this country. These leaders<br/>
believed that realizing their two-fold goal of ridding our society of<br/>
religion and providing an education for immigrant children mandated<br/>
compulsory education for every child. Soon, the various states were<br/>
passing compulsory attendance laws and children began to be public<br/>
schooled en masse. <br/>
So, as dads were leaving home with a promise of employment, children were<br/>
also leaving home with a promise of being made employable for the next<br/>
generation. Within a very short period of time, the family unit that had<br/>
been tightly held together for generations, became a set of individuals<br/>
going their separate ways. To the factories went the dads. To the schools<br/>
went the kids. Where Mom went is the subject of another article. <br/>
It wasn’t long before people forgot what it was like to be a family with<br/>
Dad as the head of a &quot;family enterprise&quot; and the whole family working<br/>
together as co-producers. In one generation, the cultural memory of<br/>
children growing up at home was forgotten. Children belonged &quot;in school&quot;<br/>
during the most productive hours of their day, learning whatever would<br/>
make them employable, becoming independent, establishing strong<br/>
friendships that replaced the bonds of family. And what had been a<br/>
lifestyle of learning became &quot;book learning&quot; as learning became separated<br/>
from real life. Of course, there was always a small group of families<br/>
whose children never attended public school. Typically, these were<br/>
American&#39;s wealthiest whose children received exclusive private<br/>
educations in areas intended to prepare them for leadership in<br/>
government, education, science and business. Most Americans don’t realize<br/>
that public school was never intended to prepare leaders. It has always<br/>
been intended to prepare employees. [For a fuller understanding of this<br/>
subject, read John Gatto&#39;s books, The Underground History of American<br/>
Education, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Dumbing us Down]. <br/>
HOW SHOULD WE THEN SCHOOL? <br/>
In the 1950&#39;s—one hundred years after the of the public school movement<br/>
began—some middle class parents began to desire an educational experience<br/>
for their children whose curricula was more individualized. It was at<br/>
this time that the private school movement began. I attended one of these<br/>
schools in what should have been my fourth grade. It was little more than<br/>
an experimental school run by one man who was also the only teacher. He<br/>
didn’t like having one fourth grader, so I was skipped to fifth grade<br/>
where there was one other student. I don&#39;t remember learning much, but it<br/>
was more fun than public school! <br/>
During the Civil Rights years, the Christian school movement began along<br/>
with its own particular brand of curricula which was mainly<br/>
&quot;Christianized&quot; public school material. The concept remained that<br/>
children were to be brought out of their homes and taught by educators,<br/>
(presumably Christian), who, because they were &quot;professionals&quot; would do a<br/>
better job of training children than could the children’s parents. It<br/>
seemed that parents would now get the best of both worlds: a public-style<br/>
education that was also Christian. <br/>
Then, in the late 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s, a new schooling movement<br/>
began. All over the country, parents began keeping their children home<br/>
instead of sending them to one of the other schooling options. Some<br/>
parents made this decision out of concern for their children’s safety.<br/>
Others didn’t like the education their children were receiving. However,<br/>
the majority decided to keep their children home simply because they<br/>
wanted a relationship with them and parents didn’t think this could<br/>
happen very well if the kids were gone all day long. It was quite a novel<br/>
(and controversial) idea that children should be kept home during the<br/>
schooling hours of the day. <br/>
So, today, parents have several choices as to how their children might be<br/>
educated: <br/>
Public School Private School Christian School Home School <br/>
Note that the above choices relate to where and how the child is<br/>
educated. In the past 150 years we have changed the first word, but we<br/>
have not changed the last word, &quot;School.&quot; Each choice still emphasizes<br/>
the fact that children are to be &quot;schooled.&quot; <br/>
A MISUNDERSTOOD MOVEMENT? <br/>
I don&#39;t know how keeping our children home during the day came to be<br/>
known as &quot;Home Schooling,&quot; but I do have a theory: If I asked most<br/>
adults, &quot;What is the appropriate activity for every child, age six to age<br/>
eighteen, during the days Monday through Friday?&quot; Most adults would say,<br/>
&quot;These are the years when a child is being schooled, of course.&quot; That is<br/>
why we have such phrases in our vocabulary as the &quot;school age child.&quot; So,<br/>
if a child is to be &quot;schooled&quot; during these formative years, the only<br/>
real question is, &quot;Where will he be schooled?&quot; Today, the answer is, &quot;He<br/>
will either be public schooled, private schooled, Christian schooled, or<br/>
home schooled.&quot; <br/>
Assuming, then, that every child is to &quot;be schooled&quot; during the day, if<br/>
he is home during the day, he will be home schooled during the day. Hence<br/>
the origin of the label &quot;homeschooling.&quot; <br/>
Is &quot;schooling&quot; really supposed to be a child’s primary daily activity? It<br/>
wasn’t until the advent of the modern public school movement. Schooling a<br/>
child was never meant to be the &quot;constant&quot; with the variable being where<br/>
the child spends his or her day. It has always been just the other way<br/>
around. <br/>
What is so problematic with the term &quot;Home Schooling&quot; is what it has done<br/>
to parents whose children are spending their days at home. Giving an<br/>
activity a label means something to those involved in the activity. If we<br/>
are comfortable with certain words in the label and not so comfortable<br/>
with other words, those words with which we feel least secure will take<br/>
on greater significance. Insecurity is a nice word for fear. Whatever we<br/>
fear becomes a driver in our lives as we attempt to overcome our fear and<br/>
feel secure again. <br/>
When we sent our children to school, we felt a sense of security that<br/>
trained professionals were educating them. We didn&#39;t pretend that we<br/>
could do a job which others had spent years being trained to do. We might<br/>
feel that we could raise our children in some areas, but not to provide<br/>
for their education. <br/>
Then, one day, we became homeschoolers. Insecure homeschooler; but<br/>
homeschoolers nevertheless. However, since what we were doing was labeled<br/>
&quot;homeschooling,&quot; we, in our insecurity, actually became home-SCHOOLERS<br/>
rather than HOME-schoolers. The importance of our children becoming<br/>
educated (isn&#39;t that what children do during the day?) took on greater<br/>
prominence than the importance of them being home. This is understandable<br/>
when we realize that there is no cultural memory of what having our<br/>
children home really means to the family or to society. <br/>
What did I mean when I told my son, &quot;And, your kids won&#39;t be<br/>
homeschooled&quot;? During Seth&#39;s years at home, his academic education was<br/>
never the main priority. In our home, we did have a rigid priority<br/>
structure, but those priorities were first relationships; second,<br/>
practical skills; and, finally, academics. Seth grew up with a strong<br/>
academic upbringing, but academics were never our priority. Seth is a<br/>
skilled, very competent individual of the highest character. He is also<br/>
one of the happiest young men I have ever known. As I look back at Seth&#39;s<br/>
time at home, I have come to realize that he was never &quot;homeschooled.&quot; He<br/>
simply grew up in a most remarkable place—his home <br/>
When our children were young we would take them with us to the store.<br/>
Other kids were in school. The check-out lady would inevitably ask, &quot;You<br/>
boys aren’t in school today?&quot; Since the boys knew we were homeschoolers,<br/>
they would respond, &quot;No, ma’am, we’re homeschooled.&quot; <br/>
STARTING OVER <br/>
If I could do it all over again, I would not call ourselves<br/>
&quot;homeschoolers.&quot; I have actually come to dislike the term because I think<br/>
it creates significant problems. If I were starting over again, when the<br/>
lady at the store says, &quot;You boys aren&#39;t in school today?&quot; I would teach<br/>
the boys to say, simply, &quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; and let it go at that. <br/>
In just the past year I have noticed a growing distinction between<br/>
families who are homeschooling and those whose children are home, but not<br/>
being homeSCHOOLED. Are the &quot;not-being-homeschooled&quot; children receiving a<br/>
quality upbringing, including a quality education? Today enough research<br/>
exists that I can honestly say an unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;. I would even go so<br/>
far as to say that the not-being-homeschooled child is receiving an<br/>
education which is superior to the child being homeschooled. [For a<br/>
fuller discussion on this, see our article, &quot;Identity-Directed<br/>
Homeschooling&quot;]. <br/>
The availability of what has come to be known as &quot;prepackaged curricula&quot;<br/>
is helping manifest a separation of the two types of families who were<br/>
once grouped together under the one term: &quot;homeschoolers.&quot; Many parents<br/>
purchase prepackaged curricula because they don&#39;t understand what God<br/>
originally intended when He began this movement over twenty years ago. <br/>
What do you think your children should be doing all day now that they are<br/>
home? Probably the most obvious way to determine what you really believe<br/>
is to ask yourself, &quot;Is my child the constant or is my child’s education<br/>
the constant?&quot; Look at the materials you use to bring learning into your<br/>
child’s life. Do you use graded, prepackaged, curricula? Is your child in<br/>
a grade as he would be if he were in an institutional setting? Do you<br/>
follow the institutionalized Scope & Sequence educational model? Or, have<br/>
you stepped completely out of the lock-step, institutional way of raising<br/>
your child? <br/>
This article is not intended to discourage, but to give hope. In most<br/>
parents’ hearts is the desire to reprioritize their lives around what is<br/>
truly important to them: having a relationship with their children. To<br/>
bring your children home can be an immense lifestyle change. For some,<br/>
making this change has to be done in stages. If you have brought your<br/>
children home it may have been necessary (for a season) to place before<br/>
them the ever popular &quot;curriculum-in-a-box.&quot; Hopefully, that season will<br/>
be short. Our children never went to school, were never in a grade, and<br/>
we never used a prepackaged curriculum. Nevertheless, it took us a while<br/>
to learn all that I am sharing with you here. Be encouraged. You are<br/>
allowed to do what your heart tells you is right. <br/>
IF WE AREN&#39;T HOMESCHOOLING, THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING? <br/>
Right now, nearly two million children are spending their days at home<br/>
rather than &quot;at school,&quot; thus putting an end to a 150 year &quot;detour&quot; which<br/>
began in the 1850’s and which seriously harmed family life and Kingdom<br/>
community as God initially intended them to be lived. As families leave<br/>
this detour and turn onto the road whose name is &quot;Life As It Was Intended<br/>
To Be,&quot; we will see vistas we have only read about in books. Let me offer<br/>
some suggestions. <br/>
1 | Don’t send your children to school. Any school. Bring them home.<br/>
Raise them to be the individuals God has created them to become. <br/>
2 | Don’t bring the school, any school (along with its &quot;efficient&quot;, but<br/>
arbitrary, grade levels, scope & sequence, and boxed curriculum) into<br/>
your home. Allow your children to learn through life and the<br/>
relationships around them. <br/>
3 | Learn how to awaken curiosity in your children. (This is the subject<br/>
of a future EJournal.) <br/>
4 | The only thing that should be prepackaged is your child. By this I<br/>
mean your child was born with all the talents, giftings, and callings put<br/>
into him or her since the foundation of the world. Find out what these<br/>
are and let your child become truly good at what you find. [For a fuller<br/>
discussion of this, order the Davis&#39; tape, &quot;Identity Directed<br/>
Homeschooling&quot;] <br/>
5 | Dad&#39;s heart must turn toward his children and the hearts of the<br/>
children must turn toward Dad. Ultimately, this may bring Dad out of the<br/>
corporate workforce to come home. This final step may take another<br/>
generation to be fulfilled. But, for it to be fulfilled, Dads must at<br/>
least begin moving in that direction (ie. Giving his children the option<br/>
of becoming entrepreneurs). <br/>
6 | In your own home, let &quot;homeschooling&quot; die. In other words, don&#39;t<br/>
homeschool your children. <br/>
God has asked us to raise a generation prepared for the future by<br/>
becoming exactly what He intended each person to become. This will be<br/>
different for each and every child. Your home is the place where the<br/>
acorn can become the oak tree. Or, the seed can become the maple tree.<br/>
Or, the other seed can become the pine tree. Plant your children squarely<br/>
in their own home and allow the individual God created to grow. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778676455">-=- thought this would be a good read <br/>
<br/>
for new Unschooling parents-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s not real history, I think it&#39;s NOT a good read for new <br/>
unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; These leaders<br/>
<br/>
believed that realizing their two-fold goal of ridding our society of<br/>
<br/>
religion and providing an education for immigrant children mandated<br/>
<br/>
compulsory education for every child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
Most of those early schools were HEAVILY Christian-based, and part of <br/>
enculturation in the 19th century was learning to live as Christians or to shut up if <br/>
you weren&#39;t Christian.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Within a very short period of time, the family unit that had<br/>
<br/>
been tightly held together for generations, became a set of individuals<br/>
<br/>
going their separate ways.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That article is Christian revisionist, simplified history.  Before the <br/>
industrial age, LOTS of kids were put out of the home, either to work (labor or <br/>
apprenticeship) and rich families were sending their kids to schools or to live <br/>
with richer families to increase their exposure and opportunity.  SOME kids <br/>
stayed at home to learn the family trade, but it wasn&#39;t a happy peaceful existence <br/>
from much of the records and reports, but harsh forced labor with physical <br/>
punishments.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It wasn’t long before people forgot what it was like to be a family with<br/>
<br/>
Dad as the head of a &quot;family enterprise&quot; and the whole family working<br/>
<br/>
together as co-producers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This kind of nostalgia for the agricultural past is called &quot;pastoralism,&quot; and <br/>
it&#39;s existed for hundreds of years.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course, there was always a small group of families<br/>
<br/>
whose children never attended public school. Typically, these were<br/>
<br/>
American&#39;s wealthiest whose children received exclusive private<br/>
<br/>
educations in areas intended to prepare them for leadership in<br/>
<br/>
government, education, science and business. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A large group, actually; not so small in some parts of the country.  And not <br/>
exclusively an American situation, but a long-time fact of educational life <br/>
back before there was a U.S.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Most Americans don’t realize<br/>
<br/>
that public school was never intended to prepare leaders. It has always<br/>
<br/>
been intended to prepare employees.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&quot; when referring to John Taylor Gatto&#39;s American school history has to do <br/>
with industrial cities on the East coast in the waves of immigration in the <br/>
1880s.  Gatto&#39;s view of history is a New Yorker&#39;s view of New York history, in <br/>
my opinion.   In the ACTUAL pastoral parts of the U.S. the schools were to <br/>
promote literacy and citizenship.  This is documented out the wazoo, but Gatto <br/>
didn&#39;t address the local one-room-schoolhouse models which existed in most of the <br/>
U.S.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In the 1950&#39;s—one hundred years after the of the public school movement<br/>
<br/>
began—some middle class parents began to desire an educational experience<br/>
<br/>
for their children whose curricula was more individualized. It was at<br/>
<br/>
this time that the private school movement began. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This talk of &quot;movements&quot; is another falsehood.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I attended one of these<br/>
<br/>
schools in what should have been my fourth grade. It was little more than<br/>
<br/>
an experimental school run by one man who was also the only teacher. He<br/>
<br/>
didn’t like having one fourth grader, so I was skipped to fifth grade<br/>
<br/>
where there was one other student.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s talking abut educational reform, if he&#39;s talking about experimental <br/>
schools.  School reform wasn&#39;t &quot;a private school movement.&quot;  That was the research <br/>
and activity out of which unschooling came.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;During the Civil Rights years, the Christian school movement began along<br/>
<br/>
with its own particular brand of curricula which was mainly<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Christianized&quot; public school material. The concept remained that<br/>
<br/>
children were to be brought out of their homes and taught by educators,<br/>
<br/>
(presumably Christian), who, because they were &quot;professionals&quot; would do a<br/>
<br/>
better job of training children than could the children’s parents. It<br/>
<br/>
seemed that parents would now get the best of both worlds: a public-style<br/>
<br/>
education that was also Christian. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Parochial schools were already strongly established (though they took MUCH <br/>
legal wrangling to get the government to relax about) so that Catholic kids <br/>
werne&#39;t being subjected to the Protestant-leaning curriculum which already existed.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Christian school movement&quot; he&#39;s talking about is another lie-with-terms. <br/>
 They wanted whites-only schools.  How many African Americans were not <br/>
Christian?  But calling it the &quot;White Christian school movement which wants their <br/>
kids not to be with Jews or black kids&quot; sounds so...  honestly what it was!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is understandable<br/>
<br/>
when we realize that there is no cultural memory of what having our<br/>
<br/>
children home really means to the family or to society. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This just made me shudder.<br/>
&quot;Cultural memory&quot; is another white supremist buzzword.<br/>

<br/>
A quote:<br/>
-=-Christians don&#39;t speak much of &quot;destiny&quot; anymore, mainly because it has <br/>
become a catch-word among humanists and New Agers. But we need to look again at <br/>
the concept of destiny. The Bible is full of hints that each one of us is <br/>
created for a specific time and purpose in God&#39;s unfolding plan. Ephesians 2: 10 <br/>
even says we each have &quot;good works which God predestined for us&quot; before the <br/>
world was ever created. Before time began, God had your son or daughter on His <br/>
mind, He chose your child, and He prearranged a life for him or her to live. So <br/>
parents, those teenagers in your home are not just biological events. They are <br/>
beings pre-determined by God and destined to, just as the Bible says of <br/>
David, &quot;serve their generation well.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
So he understands &quot;catch-word&quot; problems, yet he&#39;s using &quot;cultural memory&quot; <br/>
(one step from racial memory) and &quot;identity,&quot; both of which triggered me to think <br/>
of KKK and such.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A special plea to fathers: I am convinced that one of the most important <br/>
responsibilities a father has is to identify his children. What do I mean by <br/>
&quot;identify?&quot; I mean that he helps his children know who they really are.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what he says about &quot;identity,&quot; though.  It&#39;s something fathers do.<br/>
<br/>
That stuff is about Christianity in quite a political way, not much about <br/>

I don&#39;t know if this really is the best thing to have new unschooling parents <br/>
read. But me saying that smacks of censorship &lt;g&gt; I guess what I should say <br/>
is that MY personal opinion is that there are hidden-read-between-the-lines <br/>
things in this article that makes it not as innocent as it seems.<br/>
################<br/>
it wasn’t until around the mid<br/>
1800&#39;s that entire nations decided to take children out of the home and<br/>
&quot;school&quot; them. I will briefly mention the two main causes for this<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
First, in the mid-1800’s the Industrial Revolution began. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Around this same time, another movement was taking shape: The Common<br/>
(Public) School movement. The leaders of the Public School movement were,<br/>
for the most part, humanists who were concerned about two things they<br/>
believed endangered America’s future: The continuation of what they<br/>
called religious superstitious beliefs and the influx of illiterate<br/>
immigrants seeking jobs and a better life in this country. These leaders<br/>
believed that realizing their two-fold goal of ridding our society of<br/>
religion and providing an education for immigrant children mandated<br/>
compulsory education for every child. Soon, the various states were<br/>
passing compulsory attendance laws and children began to be public<br/>
schooled en masse. <br/>
##############<br/>
While some of the public schools may have been started by so called <br/>
humanists, most if not almost all were started by small communities across the nation, <br/>
largely christian. One room school houses sometimes also the church (only <br/>
church) in town as well. Single female teacher hired by the male *school board* <br/>
and boarded by a family near the school. My own great grandmothers diary reads <br/>
something like this; *A good strong, God fearing community. Asked if I would be <br/>
attending church services locally, I had no problems answering in the <br/>
affirmative. I only asked that I be boarded by a good Lutheran family, and the large <br/>
man laughed jovially as if there were any question in the matter. Of course I <br/>
will not be seeing Otto for the term, teachers do not go out with gentlemen <br/>
and certainly do not announce an engagement of marriage.* My g-grandma was <br/>
certainly not a humanist nor were the men who hired her. <br/>
#################<br/>
<br/>
So, as dads were leaving home with a promise of employment, children were<br/>
also leaving home with a promise of being made employable for the next<br/>
generation. Within a very short period of time, the family unit that had<br/>
been tightly held together for generations, became a set of individuals<br/>
going their separate ways. To the factories went the dads. To the schools<br/>
went the kids. Where Mom went is the subject of another article. <br/>
##################<br/>
Yes, we won&#39;t be reading much about Mom in the rest of this article. Where is <br/>
Mom? <br/>
##################<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t long before people forgot what it was like to be a family with<br/>
Dad as the head of a &quot;family enterprise&quot; and the whole family working<br/>
together as co-producers. In one generation, the cultural memory of<br/>
children growing up at home was forgotten. <br/>
<br/>
########################<br/>
This idea of yesteryear being the ideal didn&#39;t start after this so called on <br/>
generation. There is a word for this, it slips my mind now. As for this idea <br/>
of cultural memory, he also brings up another term of identity-dirrected <br/>
homeschooling, both which leave me thinking of nazism and racism. Chills.<br/>
########################<br/>
<br/>
In the 1950&#39;s—one hundred years after the of the public school movement<br/>
began—some middle class parents began to desire an educational experience<br/>
for their children whose curricula was more individualized. It was at<br/>
this time that the private school movement began. I attended one of these<br/>
schools in what should have been my fourth grade. It was little more than<br/>
an experimental school run by one man who was also the only teacher. He<br/>
didn’t like having one fourth grader, so I was skipped to fifth grade<br/>
where there was one other student. I don&#39;t remember learning much, but it<br/>
was more fun than public school! <br/>
<br/>
#####################<br/>
He is talking about educational reform. Not some middle class movement. <br/>
Schools across the country tried this or something like this for a year or two and <br/>
then someone else came along with a new idea. He spends his entire article <br/>
trying desperately to have us believe he doesn&#39;t believe in school=learning and <br/>
learing=school and brings the whole facade down in one small sentence. &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
remember learning much, but it was more fun than public school!&quot; Even he <br/>
still equates school with learning and that one year, failed attempt didn&#39;t work, <br/>
i.e. he didn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; the unsaid words here are *what he was supposed to.* as <br/>
in what he implied, but didn&#39;t write is; &quot;I don&#39;t remember learning what I <br/>
was supposed to, but it was more fun than public school.&quot;<br/>
######################<br/>
<br/>
During the Civil Rights years, the Christian school movement began along<br/>
with its own particular brand of curricula which was mainly<br/>
&quot;Christianized&quot; public school material. The concept remained that<br/>
children were to be brought out of their homes and taught by educators,<br/>
(presumably Christian), who, because they were &quot;professionals&quot; would do a<br/>
better job of training children than could the children’s parents. It<br/>
seemed that parents would now get the best of both worlds: a public-style<br/>
education that was also Christian. <br/>
<br/>
##################<br/>
WRONG! He really needs to reread his copy of Gatto! I think he must have <br/>
missed a chapter or five. Schools were until this time largely christian.<br/>
################## <br/>
<br/>
Are the &quot;not-being-homeschooled&quot; children receiving a<br/>
quality upbringing, including a quality education? Today enough research<br/>
exists that I can honestly say an unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;. I would even go so<br/>
far as to say that the not-being-homeschooled child is receiving an<br/>
education which is superior to the child being homeschooled. [For a<br/>
fuller discussion on this, see our article, &quot;Identity-Directed<br/>
Homeschooling&quot;]. <br/>
<br/>
##############<br/>
Here he tries to get the reader to believe that this *Identity-Directed <br/>
Homeschooling* would be the same as unschooling. Notice he never uses the term <br/>
unschooling, yet tries to imply to the reader that that is what he intends. One <br/>
should never equate identity-directed with unschooling, ever. <br/>
##############<br/>
<br/>
This article is not intended to discourage, but to give hope.&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Be encouraged. You are allowed to do what your heart tells you is right. <br/>
IF WE AREN&#39;T HOMESCHOOLING, THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING? <br/>
Right now, nearly two million children are spending their days at home<br/>
rather than &quot;at school,&quot; thus putting an end to a 150 year &quot;detour&quot; which<br/>
began in the 1850’s and which seriously harmed family life and Kingdom<br/>
community as God initially intended them to be lived. As families leave<br/>
this detour and turn onto the road whose name is &quot;Life As It Was Intended<br/>
To Be,&quot; we will see vistas we have only read about in books. <br/>
<br/>
#####################<br/>
White supermacist propaganda. &quot;Kingdom community&quot; &quot;As God intended...&quot; &quot;Life <br/>
as it was intended to be&quot; No Blacks in our neighborhood, no Jews in our <br/>
clubs.. If people seriously don&#39;t believe there are christians out there <br/>
homeschooling their kids in this way, they really need to do some reading. No, not all <br/>
christians, but many.<br/>
#####################<br/>
<br/>
Dad&#39;s heart must turn toward his children and the hearts of the<br/>
children must turn toward Dad. Ultimately, this may bring Dad out of the<br/>
corporate workforce to come home. This final step may take another<br/>
generation to be fulfilled. But, for it to be fulfilled, Dads must at<br/>
least begin moving in that direction (i.e. Giving his children the option<br/>
of becoming entrepreneurs). <br/>
<br/>

Here we are again! Where is Mom? I think she is in the laundry room washing a <br/>
mountain of clothes or in the kitchen preparing a meal and sneaking sips of <br/>
the wine she tells her husband she uses to flavor that favorite dish of his. <br/>
Really though, in families like this mom is a teacher, dad is the principal, god <br/>
is the superintendent. <br/>
################<br/>
<br/>
God has asked us to raise a generation prepared for the future by<br/>
becoming exactly what He intended each person to become. This will be<br/>
different for each and every child. Your home is the place where the<br/>
acorn can become the oak tree. Or, the seed can become the maple tree.<br/>
Or, the other seed can become the pine tree. Plant your children squarely<br/>
in their own home and allow the individual God created to grow. <br/>

  THE DAY HOMESCHOOLING DIES<br/>
  Email | 21 Oct 03 | Chis Davis<br/>
  Posted on 10/21/2003 7:15 PM EDT by SLB<br/>
  My oldest son, Seth, was homeschooled the entire time he lived at home.<br/>
  This past summer, as he and I were discussing his upbringing, I had a<br/>
  realization about this movement we all call &quot;homeschooling,&quot; and I said<br/>
  to Seth, &quot;When you have kids, they will not be public schooled. They<br/>
  won&#39;t be private schooled. They won&#39;t be Christian schooled.&quot; <br/>
  &quot;And,&quot; I concluded, &quot;your kids won&#39;t be home schooled, either.&quot; <br/>
  The realization I had while talking with Seth is that God had begun<br/>
  something twenty years ago that came to be called &quot;homeschooling,&quot; but<br/>
  which really wasn t about schooling at all. Here&#39;s what I mean. <br/>
  THE COLLAPSE OF THE FAMILY <br/>
  For thousands of years children have grown up in what today would be<br/>
  considered an unnatural place—the home. In this setting, parents never<br/>
  thought of themselves as &quot;home schoolers.&quot; There was no alternative to<br/>
  children spending their days at home, having knowledge, experiences and<br/>
  character passed to them by their parents and extended family. What<br/>
  children needed to know, they learned as part of their daily lives:<br/>
  sowing and reaping, weather, how a business works, how to treat customers<br/>
  (and everyone else, for that matter). Life was their education. <br/>
  Throughout history, small, homogeneous groups have attempted to provide a<br/>
  common education for their youth, yet it wasn’t until around the mid<br/>
  1800&#39;s that entire nations decided to take children out of the home and<br/>
  &quot;school&quot; them. I will briefly mention the two main causes for this<br/>
<br/>
  dramatic change in the way we began raising our children. Interestingly,<br/>
  both occurred at approximately the same time. <br/>
  First, in the mid-1800’s the Industrial Revolution began. The new<br/>
  factories needed laborers and the siren call went out for men to leave<br/>
  their homes and be paid a salary (something new for most men). The<br/>
  possibility of being able to increase one’s family&#39;s standard of living<br/>
  was the draw that caused men to cease being patriarchs of a family<br/>
  enterprise and become employees. <br/>
  Around this same time, another movement was taking shape: The Common<br/>
  (Public) School movement. The leaders of the Public School movement were,<br/>
  for the most part, humanists who were concerned about two things they<br/>
  believed endangered America’s future: The continuation of what they<br/>
  called religious superstitious beliefs and the influx of illiterate<br/>
  immigrants seeking jobs and a better life in this country. These leaders<br/>
  believed that realizing their two-fold goal of ridding our society of<br/>
  religion and providing an education for immigrant children mandated<br/>
  compulsory education for every child. Soon, the various states were<br/>
  passing compulsory attendance laws and children began to be public<br/>
  schooled en masse. <br/>
  So, as dads were leaving home with a promise of employment, children were<br/>
  also leaving home with a promise of being made employable for the next<br/>
  generation. Within a very short period of time, the family unit that had<br/>
  been tightly held together for generations, became a set of individuals<br/>
  going their separate ways. To the factories went the dads. To the schools<br/>
  went the kids. Where Mom went is the subject of another article. <br/>
  It wasn’t long before people forgot what it was like to be a family with<br/>
  Dad as the head of a &quot;family enterprise&quot; and the whole family working<br/>
  together as co-producers. In one generation, the cultural memory of<br/>
  children growing up at home was forgotten. Children belonged &quot;in school&quot;<br/>
  during the most productive hours of their day, learning whatever would<br/>
  make them employable, becoming independent, establishing strong<br/>
  friendships that replaced the bonds of family. And what had been a<br/>
  lifestyle of learning became &quot;book learning&quot; as learning became separated<br/>
  from real life. Of course, there was always a small group of families<br/>
  whose children never attended public school. Typically, these were<br/>
  American&#39;s wealthiest whose children received exclusive private<br/>
  educations in areas intended to prepare them for leadership in<br/>
  government, education, science and business. Most Americans don’t realize<br/>
  that public school was never intended to prepare leaders. It has always<br/>
  been intended to prepare employees. [For a fuller understanding of this<br/>
  subject, read John Gatto&#39;s books, The Underground History of American<br/>
  Education, A Different Kind of Teacher, and Dumbing us Down]. <br/>
  HOW SHOULD WE THEN SCHOOL? <br/>
  In the 1950&#39;s—one hundred years after the of the public school movement<br/>
  began—some middle class parents began to desire an educational experience<br/>
  for their children whose curricula was more individualized. It was at<br/>
  this time that the private school movement began. I attended one of these<br/>
  schools in what should have been my fourth grade. It was little more than<br/>
  an experimental school run by one man who was also the only teacher. He<br/>
  didn’t like having one fourth grader, so I was skipped to fifth grade<br/>
  where there was one other student. I don&#39;t remember learning much, but it<br/>
  was more fun than public school! <br/>
  During the Civil Rights years, the Christian school movement began along<br/>
  with its own particular brand of curricula which was mainly<br/>
  &quot;Christianized&quot; public school material. The concept remained that<br/>
  children were to be brought out of their homes and taught by educators,<br/>
  (presumably Christian), who, because they were &quot;professionals&quot; would do a<br/>
  better job of training children than could the children’s parents. It<br/>
  seemed that parents would now get the best of both worlds: a public-style<br/>
  education that was also Christian. <br/>
  Then, in the late 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s, a new schooling movement<br/>
  began. All over the country, parents began keeping their children home<br/>
  instead of sending them to one of the other schooling options. Some<br/>
  parents made this decision out of concern for their children’s safety.<br/>
  Others didn’t like the education their children were receiving. However,<br/>
  the majority decided to keep their children home simply because they<br/>
  wanted a relationship with them and parents didn’t think this could<br/>
  happen very well if the kids were gone all day long. It was quite a novel<br/>
  (and controversial) idea that children should be kept home during the<br/>
  schooling hours of the day. <br/>
  So, today, parents have several choices as to how their children might be<br/>
  educated: <br/>
  Public School Private School Christian School Home School <br/>
  Note that the above choices relate to where and how the child is<br/>
  educated. In the past 150 years we have changed the first word, but we<br/>
  have not changed the last word, &quot;School.&quot; Each choice still emphasizes<br/>
  the fact that children are to be &quot;schooled.&quot; <br/>
  A MISUNDERSTOOD MOVEMENT? <br/>
  I don&#39;t know how keeping our children home during the day came to be<br/>
  known as &quot;Home Schooling,&quot; but I do have a theory: If I asked most<br/>
  adults, &quot;What is the appropriate activity for every child, age six to age<br/>
  eighteen, during the days Monday through Friday?&quot; Most adults would say,<br/>
  &quot;These are the years when a child is being schooled, of course.&quot; That is<br/>
  why we have such phrases in our vocabulary as the &quot;school age child.&quot; So,<br/>
  if a child is to be &quot;schooled&quot; during these formative years, the only<br/>
  real question is, &quot;Where will he be schooled?&quot; Today, the answer is, &quot;He<br/>
  will either be public schooled, private schooled, Christian schooled, or<br/>
  home schooled.&quot; <br/>
  Assuming, then, that every child is to &quot;be schooled&quot; during the day, if<br/>
  he is home during the day, he will be home schooled during the day. Hence<br/>
  the origin of the label &quot;homeschooling.&quot; <br/>
  Is &quot;schooling&quot; really supposed to be a child’s primary daily activity? It<br/>
  wasn’t until the advent of the modern public school movement. Schooling a<br/>
  child was never meant to be the &quot;constant&quot; with the variable being where<br/>
  the child spends his or her day. It has always been just the other way<br/>
  around. <br/>
  What is so problematic with the term &quot;Home Schooling&quot; is what it has done<br/>
  to parents whose children are spending their days at home. Giving an<br/>
  activity a label means something to those involved in the activity. If we<br/>
  are comfortable with certain words in the label and not so comfortable<br/>
  with other words, those words with which we feel least secure will take<br/>
  on greater significance. Insecurity is a nice word for fear. Whatever we<br/>
  fear becomes a driver in our lives as we attempt to overcome our fear and<br/>
  feel secure again. <br/>
  When we sent our children to school, we felt a sense of security that<br/>
  trained professionals were educating them. We didn&#39;t pretend that we<br/>
  could do a job which others had spent years being trained to do. We might<br/>
  feel that we could raise our children in some areas, but not to provide<br/>
  for their education. <br/>
  Then, one day, we became homeschoolers. Insecure homeschooler; but<br/>
  homeschoolers nevertheless. However, since what we were doing was labeled<br/>
  &quot;homeschooling,&quot; we, in our insecurity, actually became home-SCHOOLERS<br/>
  rather than HOME-schoolers. The importance of our children becoming<br/>
  educated (isn&#39;t that what children do during the day?) took on greater<br/>
  prominence than the importance of them being home. This is understandable<br/>
  when we realize that there is no cultural memory of what having our<br/>
  children home really means to the family or to society. <br/>
  What did I mean when I told my son, &quot;And, your kids won&#39;t be<br/>
  homeschooled&quot;? During Seth&#39;s years at home, his academic education was<br/>
  never the main priority. In our home, we did have a rigid priority<br/>
  structure, but those priorities were first relationships; second,<br/>
  practical skills; and, finally, academics. Seth grew up with a strong<br/>
  academic upbringing, but academics were never our priority. Seth is a<br/>
  skilled, very competent individual of the highest character. He is also<br/>
  one of the happiest young men I have ever known. As I look back at Seth&#39;s<br/>
  time at home, I have come to realize that he was never &quot;homeschooled.&quot; He<br/>
  simply grew up in a most remarkable place—his home <br/>
  When our children were young we would take them with us to the store.<br/>
  Other kids were in school. The check-out lady would inevitably ask, &quot;You<br/>
  boys aren’t in school today?&quot; Since the boys knew we were homeschoolers,<br/>
  they would respond, &quot;No, ma’am, we’re homeschooled.&quot; <br/>
  STARTING OVER <br/>
  If I could do it all over again, I would not call ourselves<br/>
  &quot;homeschoolers.&quot; I have actually come to dislike the term because I think<br/>
  it creates significant problems. If I were starting over again, when the<br/>
  lady at the store says, &quot;You boys aren&#39;t in school today?&quot; I would teach<br/>
  the boys to say, simply, &quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; and let it go at that. <br/>
  In just the past year I have noticed a growing distinction between<br/>
  families who are homeschooling and those whose children are home, but not<br/>
  being homeSCHOOLED. Are the &quot;not-being-homeschooled&quot; children receiving a<br/>
  quality upbringing, including a quality education? Today enough research<br/>
  exists that I can honestly say an unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;. I would even go so<br/>
  far as to say that the not-being-homeschooled child is receiving an<br/>
  education which is superior to the child being homeschooled. [For a<br/>
  fuller discussion on this, see our article, &quot;Identity-Directed<br/>
  Homeschooling&quot;]. <br/>
  The availability of what has come to be known as &quot;prepackaged curricula&quot;<br/>
  is helping manifest a separation of the two types of families who were<br/>
  once grouped together under the one term: &quot;homeschoolers.&quot; Many parents<br/>
  purchase prepackaged curricula because they don&#39;t understand what God<br/>
  originally intended when He began this movement over twenty years ago. <br/>
  What do you think your children should be doing all day now that they are<br/>
  home? Probably the most obvious way to determine what you really believe<br/>
  is to ask yourself, &quot;Is my child the constant or is my child’s education<br/>
  the constant?&quot; Look at the materials you use to bring learning into your<br/>
  child’s life. Do you use graded, prepackaged, curricula? Is your child in<br/>
  a grade as he would be if he were in an institutional setting? Do you<br/>
  follow the institutionalized Scope & Sequence educational model? Or, have<br/>
  you stepped completely out of the lock-step, institutional way of raising<br/>
  your child? <br/>
  This article is not intended to discourage, but to give hope. In most<br/>
  parents’ hearts is the desire to reprioritize their lives around what is<br/>
  truly important to them: having a relationship with their children. To<br/>
  bring your children home can be an immense lifestyle change. For some,<br/>
  making this change has to be done in stages. If you have brought your<br/>
  children home it may have been necessary (for a season) to place before<br/>
  them the ever popular &quot;curriculum-in-a-box.&quot; Hopefully, that season will<br/>
  be short. Our children never went to school, were never in a grade, and<br/>
  we never used a prepackaged curriculum. Nevertheless, it took us a while<br/>
  to learn all that I am sharing with you here. Be encouraged. You are<br/>
  allowed to do what your heart tells you is right. <br/>
  IF WE AREN&#39;T HOMESCHOOLING, THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING? <br/>
  Right now, nearly two million children are spending their days at home<br/>
  rather than &quot;at school,&quot; thus putting an end to a 150 year &quot;detour&quot; which<br/>
  began in the 1850’s and which seriously harmed family life and Kingdom<br/>
  community as God initially intended them to be lived. As families leave<br/>
  this detour and turn onto the road whose name is &quot;Life As It Was Intended<br/>
  To Be,&quot; we will see vistas we have only read about in books. Let me offer<br/>
  some suggestions. <br/>
  1 | Don’t send your children to school. Any school. Bring them home.<br/>
  Raise them to be the individuals God has created them to become. <br/>
  2 | Don’t bring the school, any school (along with its &quot;efficient&quot;, but<br/>
  arbitrary, grade levels, scope & sequence, and boxed curriculum) into<br/>
  your home. Allow your children to learn through life and the<br/>
  relationships around them. <br/>
  3 | Learn how to awaken curiosity in your children. (This is the subject<br/>
  of a future EJournal.) <br/>
  4 | The only thing that should be prepackaged is your child. By this I<br/>
  mean your child was born with all the talents, giftings, and callings put<br/>
  into him or her since the foundation of the world. Find out what these<br/>
  are and let your child become truly good at what you find. [For a fuller<br/>
  discussion of this, order the Davis&#39; tape, &quot;Identity Directed<br/>
  Homeschooling&quot;] <br/>
  5 | Dad&#39;s heart must turn toward his children and the hearts of the<br/>
  children must turn toward Dad. Ultimately, this may bring Dad out of the<br/>
  corporate workforce to come home. This final step may take another<br/>
  generation to be fulfilled. But, for it to be fulfilled, Dads must at<br/>
  least begin moving in that direction (ie. Giving his children the option<br/>
  of becoming entrepreneurs). <br/>
  6 | In your own home, let &quot;homeschooling&quot; die. In other words, don&#39;t<br/>
  homeschool your children. <br/>
  God has asked us to raise a generation prepared for the future by<br/>
  becoming exactly what He intended each person to become. This will be<br/>
  different for each and every child. Your home is the place where the<br/>
  acorn can become the oak tree. Or, the seed can become the maple tree.<br/>
  Or, the other seed can become the pine tree. Plant your children squarely<br/>
  in their own home and allow the individual God created to grow. <br/>

  ##############<br/>
  I don&#39;t know if this really is the best thing to have new unschooling parents <br/>
  read. But me saying that smacks of censorship &lt;g&gt; I guess what I should say <br/>
  is that MY personal opinion is that there are hidden-read-between-the-lines <br/>
  things in this article that makes it not as innocent as it seems.<br/>
  ################<br/>
  it wasn’t until around the mid<br/>
  1800&#39;s that entire nations decided to take children out of the home and<br/>
  &quot;school&quot; them. I will briefly mention the two main causes for this<br/>
  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
  First, in the mid-1800’s the Industrial Revolution began. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
  Around this same time, another movement was taking shape: The Common<br/>
  (Public) School movement. The leaders of the Public School movement were,<br/>
  for the most part, humanists who were concerned about two things they<br/>
  believed endangered America’s future: The continuation of what they<br/>
  called religious superstitious beliefs and the influx of illiterate<br/>
  immigrants seeking jobs and a better life in this country. These leaders<br/>
  believed that realizing their two-fold goal of ridding our society of<br/>
  religion and providing an education for immigrant children mandated<br/>
  compulsory education for every child. Soon, the various states were<br/>
  passing compulsory attendance laws and children began to be public<br/>
  schooled en masse. <br/>
  ##############<br/>
  While some of the public schools may have been started by so called <br/>
  humanists, most if not almost all were started by small communities across the nation, <br/>
  largely christian. One room school houses sometimes also the church (only <br/>
  church) in town as well. Single female teacher hired by the male *school board* <br/>
  and boarded by a family near the school. My own great grandmothers diary reads <br/>
  something like this; *A good strong, God fearing community. Asked if I would be <br/>
  attending church services locally, I had no problems answering in the <br/>
  affirmative. I only asked that I be boarded by a good Lutheran family, and the large <br/>
  man laughed jovially as if there were any question in the matter. Of course I <br/>
  will not be seeing Otto for the term, teachers do not go out with gentlemen <br/>
  and certainly do not announce an engagement of marriage.* My g-grandma was <br/>
  certainly not a humanist nor were the men who hired her. <br/>
  #################<br/>
<br/>
  So, as dads were leaving home with a promise of employment, children were<br/>
  also leaving home with a promise of being made employable for the next<br/>
  generation. Within a very short period of time, the family unit that had<br/>
  been tightly held together for generations, became a set of individuals<br/>
  going their separate ways. To the factories went the dads. To the schools<br/>
  went the kids. Where Mom went is the subject of another article. <br/>
  ##################<br/>
  Yes, we won&#39;t be reading much about Mom in the rest of this article. Where is <br/>
  Mom? <br/>
  ##################<br/>
<br/>
  It wasn’t long before people forgot what it was like to be a family with<br/>
  Dad as the head of a &quot;family enterprise&quot; and the whole family working<br/>
  together as co-producers. In one generation, the cultural memory of<br/>
  children growing up at home was forgotten. <br/>
<br/>
  ########################<br/>
  This idea of yesteryear being the ideal didn&#39;t start after this so called on <br/>
  generation. There is a word for this, it slips my mind now. As for this idea <br/>
  of cultural memory, he also brings up another term of identity-dirrected <br/>
  homeschooling, both which leave me thinking of nazism and racism. Chills.<br/>
  ########################<br/>
<br/>
  In the 1950&#39;s—one hundred years after the of the public school movement<br/>
  began—some middle class parents began to desire an educational experience<br/>
  for their children whose curricula was more individualized. It was at<br/>
  this time that the private school movement began. I attended one of these<br/>
  schools in what should have been my fourth grade. It was little more than<br/>
  an experimental school run by one man who was also the only teacher. He<br/>
  didn’t like having one fourth grader, so I was skipped to fifth grade<br/>
  where there was one other student. I don&#39;t remember learning much, but it<br/>
  was more fun than public school! <br/>
<br/>
  #####################<br/>
  He is talking about educational reform. Not some middle class movement. <br/>
  Schools across the country tried this or something like this for a year or two and <br/>
  then someone else came along with a new idea. He spends his entire article <br/>
  trying desperately to have us believe he doesn&#39;t believe in school=learning and <br/>
  learing=school and brings the whole facade down in one small sentence. &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
  remember learning much, but it was more fun than public school!&quot; Even he <br/>
  still equates school with learning and that one year, failed attempt didn&#39;t work, <br/>
  i.e. he didn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; the unsaid words here are *what he was supposed to.* as <br/>
  in what he implied, but didn&#39;t write is; &quot;I don&#39;t remember learning what I <br/>
  was supposed to, but it was more fun than public school.&quot;<br/>
  ######################<br/>
<br/>
  During the Civil Rights years, the Christian school movement began along<br/>
  with its own particular brand of curricula which was mainly<br/>
  &quot;Christianized&quot; public school material. The concept remained that<br/>
  children were to be brought out of their homes and taught by educators,<br/>
  (presumably Christian), who, because they were &quot;professionals&quot; would do a<br/>
  better job of training children than could the children’s parents. It<br/>
  seemed that parents would now get the best of both worlds: a public-style<br/>
  education that was also Christian. <br/>
<br/>
  ##################<br/>
  WRONG! He really needs to reread his copy of Gatto! I think he must have <br/>
  missed a chapter or five. Schools were until this time largely christian.<br/>
  ################## <br/>
<br/>
  Are the &quot;not-being-homeschooled&quot; children receiving a<br/>
  quality upbringing, including a quality education? Today enough research<br/>
  exists that I can honestly say an unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;. I would even go so<br/>
  far as to say that the not-being-homeschooled child is receiving an<br/>
  education which is superior to the child being homeschooled. [For a<br/>
  fuller discussion on this, see our article, &quot;Identity-Directed<br/>
  Homeschooling&quot;]. <br/>
<br/>
  ##############<br/>
  Here he tries to get the reader to believe that this *Identity-Directed <br/>
  Homeschooling* would be the same as unschooling. Notice he never uses the term <br/>
  unschooling, yet tries to imply to the reader that that is what he intends. One <br/>
  should never equate identity-directed with unschooling, ever. <br/>

<br/>
  This article is not intended to discourage, but to give hope.&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
  Be encouraged. You are allowed to do what your heart tells you is right. <br/>

  White supermacist propaganda. &quot;Kingdom community&quot; &quot;As God intended...&quot; &quot;Life <br/>
  as it was intended to be&quot; No Blacks in our neighborhood, no Jews in our <br/>

  homeschooling their kids in this way, they really need to do some reading. No, not all <br/>

  Here we are again! Where is Mom? I think she is in the laundry room washing a <br/>
  mountain of clothes or in the kitchen preparing a meal and sneaking sips of <br/>
  the wine she tells her husband she uses to flavor that favorite dish of his. <br/>
  Really though, in families like this mom is a teacher, dad is the principal, god <br/>
  is the superintendent. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674726077">I posted the article and I also saw it differently. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t read it for the Christian parts AT ALL!<br/>
To me it was cut and dry. <br/>
What I got out of it was shake the curricula and be with your family.<br/>
As far as the Father comment I simply saw that as dahh many Mom&#39;s dont need <br/>
help spending time with their kids. I dont think I have seen one father post <br/>
about a mom that disagreed with Unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
As for the word HOMESCHOOLING which was the main topic I felt he was saying <br/>
that Traditional HS puts blocks between families. Call me simple...<br/>
<br/>
When I posted this it had just come off our Maine lists. On our lists many <br/>
parents are textbook Traditional Christian Homeschoolers.<br/>
In my mind and heart it hit a cord for me in my day to day dealings. <br/>
<br/>
 NOW, I am fully aware that the E company is well known to be firm <br/>
Christian&#39;s. BUT I read and judge how I feel about each article, topic and writer. I <br/>
dont black them out because I read one thing and now I think they are freaks in <br/>
every article they write. If I was to take in everything someone said I would <br/>
be in a bitter light as someone would be wrong, right?  <br/>
I came to Unschooling before I even knew it had a name, was even done or that <br/>
someone had been doing it in their state for 20 years. I didn&#39;t change <br/>
because someone said it was a better way, I found it myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I dont practice any religion and I could care less about it. The bible was <br/>
forced on me as a child so I take no interest in it now. The &quot;god&quot; references <br/>
bugged me a bit but I saw the article not as a religious post.<br/>
<br/>
I read articles all the time that go on and on about nothing. Some make no <br/>
sense to new homeschoolers/unschoolers.  If a potential newbie is reading they <br/>
are searching for that one or two articles that strike a cord and get them off <br/>
their feet.  To me this article spoke to new Homeschoolers about families and <br/>
bonding NOT curricula/books which is what they sell. To me it said bring your <br/>
children home, spend time as a family and dont worry about the books its not <br/>
as important. To me that is closer to Unschooling than any other type or label.<br/>
<br/>
I can see if I was a remotely religious that this would have been a <br/>
calculated post. It was not that at all.  What I said was---&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This was posted to <br/>
another list I am on. I thought this would be a good read for new Unschooling <br/>
parents and those struggling with not using a curricula.&quot;<br/>
