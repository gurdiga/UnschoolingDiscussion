<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330411521">Dar makes some good points here....especially about your dd doing her *own*<br/>
research.  If she wants that path,  SHE should be on it as the driver.<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many different ways of *being* a doctor.....a teaching one,   a<br/>
research one,   a psychiatrist,  a rural doc.   Not to mention the whole<br/>
health care system is changing greatly as we speak (write).  many doctors<br/>
are driven by managed care insurance companies.  Many are not thrilled woth<br/>
this...they have less power to make their own decisions and it&#39;s nearly<br/>
impossible to survive unless you practice in a group.<br/>
And with the &quot;Graying of America&quot; as well as other unpredictable<br/>
occurrences,  who knows what the face of healthcare will look like even 3-5<br/>
years from now.<br/>

P.S.  Ever see Patch Adams?  Thank goodness he didn&#39;t believe in<br/>
conventional ways!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re still looking at the conventional road, though ...<br/>
actually, if my daughter wanted to be a physician, I think the first<br/>
thing I would do would be to arrange some sort of a job shadow or<br/>
internship so she could get some real-world knowledge of the job. When I<br/>
was 14, I used to file articles and papers for my dad (who is a<br/>
physician, and also in charge of his department&#39;s residency program at a<br/>
large tecahing hospital) after school many afternoons for a couple of<br/>
hours, and just being there was a real eye-opener, even though I&#39;d been<br/>
hearing about this stuff all my life. Maybe you&#39;ve done this, I don&#39;t<br/>
know. I know my dad has spent hours talking to and emailing people who<br/>
were interested in becoming doctors, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the other thing that leaps out for me is that you&#39;re talking<br/>
about the research that *you* have done... what has your 15 year old done<br/>
for herself? I don&#39;t see myself doing that sort of stuff for my daughter<br/>
in 7 years... if seems like learning how to find out things for herself<br/>
would be a helpful thing for her to know..</div>
