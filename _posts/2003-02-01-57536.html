There&#39;s a newish word for that.  It&#39;s called &quot;exfomation.&quot;  <br/>

Here, I found something about it for you:<br/>
<br/>
EXFORMATION<br/>
<br/>
This word is used by Tor Nørretranders in his book The User Illusion, <br/>
published in Danish in 1991 and in English in 1998. He argues that effective <br/>
communication depends on a shared body of knowledge between the persons <br/>
communicating. If someone is talking about cows, for example, what is said <br/>
will be unintelligible unless the person listening has some idea what a cow <br/>
is, what it is good for, and in what contexts one might encounter one. In <br/>
using the word “cow”, Nørretranders says, the speaker has deliberately <br/>
thrown away a huge body of information, though it remains implied. He <br/>
illustrates the point with a story of Victor Hugo writing to his publisher to <br/>
ask how his most recent book, Les Miserables, was getting on. Hugo just wrote <br/>
“?”, to which his publisher replied “!”, to indicate it was selling well. <br/>
The exchange would have no meaning to a third party because the shared <br/>
context is unique to those taking part in it. This shared context Tor <br/>
Nørretranders calls exformation. He coined the word as a abbreviated form of <br/>
explicitly discarded information, originally in Danish as eksformation; the <br/>
word first appeared in English in an article he wrote in 1992. He says <br/>
“exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when <br/>
or before we say anything at all. Information is the measurable, demonstrable <br/>
utterance we actually come out with”.<br/>
<br/>
From the information content of a message alone, there is no way of measuring <br/>
how much exformation it contains.<br/>
[Tor Nørretranders, The User Illusion (1998)]<br/>
<br/>
Thought, argues Norretranders, is in fact a process of chucking away <br/>
information, and it is this detritus (happily labelled “exformation”) that <br/>
is crucially involved in “automatic” behaviours of expertise (riding a <br/>
bicycle, playing the piano), and which is therefore the most precious to us <br/>
as people.<br/>
