 </span></blockquote>We were on one of the first planes out after they resumed flying. I<br/>
figure the chances of the flight attendants having to subdue a passenger<br/>
on our flight is infinitesimal - the chances of us being in a fatal car<br/>
accident on the drive to the airport are higher, as are the odds that<br/>
we&#39;ll see someone being subdued and restrained at our local supermarket. <br/>
<br/>
The check-ins  didn&#39;t really take long at all. In Tucson we got to the<br/>
airport 3 hours early but they wouldn&#39;t let us check in until 2 hours<br/>
early. There was no line. We played cards for a while, checked in (same<br/>
routine, although about one in 10 poeple were having all of their luggage<br/>
searched), went through the metal detector (we had to show ID and tickets<br/>
again here, but it didn&#39;t take long) then played cards and browsed in the<br/>
shops until we got on the plane - which was on time - and had a pretty<br/>
uneventful ride. On the way home a week later, there was a longer line,<br/>
but no longer than it usually is in Oakland. I decided at the last minute<br/>
that I probably shouldn&#39;t try to bring my knitting needles on the plane,<br/>
so I stuck them in my checked bag. One woman ahead of us ended up<br/>
throwing away a pair of nail clippers because they weren&#39;t allowed in her<br/>
carry-on and she didn&#39;t want to check anything.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with whoever wrote about going on with our lives. <br/>
