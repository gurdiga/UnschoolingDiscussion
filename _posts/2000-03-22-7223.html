<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558883319">Hi everyone! New to the list and am seriously <br/>
considering homeschooling.  There is much more<br/>
info available than I realized!  I have three <br/>
girls and two are in school, 4th grade & kindergarten. <br/>
Until last year I felt my 9 year old was stimulated <br/>
and challenged, not anymore!  I don&#39;t think my <br/>
children are necessarily gifted but they are <br/>
certainly capable of much more than what is <br/>
currently being offered in public school. <br/>
I realize that pre-planning is the key to a <br/>
successful start in educating them at home.  <br/>
I have visited many web sites and requested info<br/>
from some regarding Home school association<br/>
memberships. I have been told not to go through <br/>
my school district.  I also ordered a book titled <br/>
&quot;Homeschool Almanac&quot; <br/>
I would appreciate any suggestions or comments <br/>
from those of you who could help me make this <br/>
a smooth transition for my girls. Specifically <br/>
what I need to look for in an association, <br/>
Curriculum and other tips.  Thanks a bunch!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021430172">Hi <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mcmich@...">mcmich@...</a> [what&#39;s your name?],<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to just do it, take the children out of school and let <br/>
them deschool for a while, they will need it.  Then after watching <br/>
them deschooling you may find [as I did] that your children learn <br/>
lots of stuff without being taught.   <br/>
<br/>
This can be a difficult concept to grasp while still in the school <br/>
mindset, where we are encouraged to believe that children are <br/>
empty vessels just waiting to be filled with information, and that the <br/>
only way you can fill their heads is to force feed them.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that nothing could possibly be further from the truth, why <br/>
look at all an infant learns in its first few years on the planet, a <br/>
whole language, lots of complicated interactions between people, <br/>
they know so much about the world, and no-one ever sat them at a <br/>
desk and made them &quot;learn&quot;.   Real learning comes from curiosity <br/>
and needs, and schooling merely seems to limit these things.  The <br/>
flame of curiosity is all but extinguished by schools attempt to <br/>
make learning such a big deal, and when locked away from the real <br/>
world for so many hours each day children have little in the way of <br/>
needs, except maybe to escape from education.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that my daughter [1 1/2 years in school] and my son <br/>
[6yrs in school] have regained that natural curiosity, it took very <br/>
little time for my daughter but my son veged out and did nothing <br/>
that seemed to indicate any return of his spirit for almost a year.  <br/>
Now after over three years away from school&#39;s damaging influence <br/>
they are real learners following their interests and needs and <br/>
teaching themselves through interaction with others, real life <br/>
experiences, the internet, cd roms, books etc.<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOLING IS GREAT ! ! ! ! ! ! !  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201418108">Hi, my name is Lisa and I have been homeschooling my children since <br/>
January. I have no support for homeschooling on my side of the family <br/>
except my husband (whose idea it orginally was to hs)and my children <br/>
who are totally all for it. I love having my children home with me <br/>
all day long and enjoy being with them. I just started the <br/>
unschooling approach about a month or two ago. I love it and so do <br/>
the children! I would never send them back to ps again unless the <br/>
children insisted that they wanted to go. But, I don&#39;t think that <br/>
will happen anytime soon! Anyway my problem is my mom. She just <br/>
totally opposes the idea of homeschooling especially unschooling. I <br/>
tried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from <br/>
her so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all. She <br/>
is so narrow minded on the subject and argues that the kids &quot;will <br/>
never learn beyond what I know or what&#39;s around them to know.&quot; I <br/>
tried to tell her that children will learn in any area that interests <br/>
them far beyond what I know or can tell them. That I have learned far <br/>
beyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to <br/>
learn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life <br/>
or raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t <br/>
have her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation <br/>
better? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for <br/>
what I feel like is best for my children. Then I start wondering if <br/>
they won&#39;t learn properly. Will they learn enough by unschooling. Can <br/>
anyone reassure me of my decision to homeschool? <br/>
Lisa, whose confused and upset at the moment.</div>

I know what you are going through. We knew we were going to <br/>
homeschool/unschool before our son was born. It took my mom a while <br/>
to get homeschooling, now she needs to get unschooling.  She just <br/>
sent us a huge expensive box full of school, flash cards & workbooks. <br/>
Our son is only 5 so she has a little time to get the whole idea.  <br/>
<br/>
What we did was to take her to a homeschool/unschool conference.  <br/>
Also giving someone a book doesn&#39;t always help but if you copied some <br/>
passages that might help her more than an entire book, she may never <br/>
read.  Also avoid the type that puts down school.  Show the benefits <br/>
of homeschool/unschool on their own merits.<br/>
<br/>
My mom is also excited to be able to share her interest with our <br/>
son.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198962481">I think the beginning of unschooling is the hardest for others to<br/>
understand and accept. <br/>
<br/>
My parents were teachers and committed to education.  They never criticized<br/>
me.  But, it took a number of years for them to see that our way works.<br/>
Perhaps your mother will change her mind, or at least soften some, when she<br/>
sees that your children are curious and learning and developing good<br/>
character traits as time goes on.  It can take time.<br/>
