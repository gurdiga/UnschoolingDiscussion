<div><font face="Arial" size="2">what exatly does your family do on a daily basis

</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">around here I wake everyone up, we don&#39;t watch t.v. 
they eat and clean up their own breakfast mess, then on to chores everyone is to 
help clean the house , ( dishes , pickup, vac, bathroom cleaning, 
ect..)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">it is a constant battle just to get this stuff 
done, seems they waste most of their day on this (well two of them 
anyway)</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I really need some real life example answers that I 
can make sense of, I feel like I don&#39;t give them enough freedom to do what they 
want,&nbsp; this is about the older kids 14,12,10 then we have a 2 and 9mo they 
help me out with alot!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">how do you balance house keeping with everything 
else and are your children self motivated in any way to help with the house? if 
so how di they get that way?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">at this point two of my older children would do 
nothing for the household at all and unless I continually remind and hound them 
about what I have asked for like watering the dogs or unloading the dishwasher, 
they will just play and do nothing instead they are 14 and 10 I think they 
should be able to help out around here without me asking.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">what are your veiws on all of this</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I really need some insight as to attitudes&nbsp; in 
other peoples homes not just what you beleive would be the idealistic way to 
unschool but how it is really going down in your own households!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">thank you for your help in advance</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I do not require any school type work from them, 
but do have alot of other controlls going on that I would like to learn to let 
go of!</font></div>

&gt; sure If I am a true all the way cut loose<br/>
&gt; unschooler<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me, too. I&#39;m still in transition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what exatly does your family do on a daily basis and<br/>
&gt; are your children required to help around the house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, people who live in a house together have to<br/>
contribute to caring for the house. I am not a<br/>
housekeeper, I&#39;m an unschooler! We all do housework.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are they just free to run and have no requirements<br/>
&gt; on them at all? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, they have to tell me where they&#39;re going, see if<br/>
it&#39;s ok, do their chores regularly. Erik does his<br/>
paper route. Aubrey has art and piano lessons. We do<br/>
volunteer work together.<br/>
<br/>
do they have wake and sleep times<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that are set?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. We have a pretty structured evening:<br/>
dinner, family walk, chores, reading aloud, quiet time<br/>
in rooms. But they tell us when they want tucking in<br/>
and lights out. If we fall asleep before they ask for<br/>
lights out, there&#39;s no tucking in, so they&#39;re pretty<br/>
aware of when we seem to be bedding down for the<br/>
night. Because they really want their tucking in!<br/>
<br/>
what about computer time and tv time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is it regulated ? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have no cable, and in this area, that means no tv<br/>
channels. For computer, no it&#39;s not regulated, except<br/>
I recently made a rule that says &quot;computer games are<br/>
for people with clean rooms.&quot; The rooms are a lot<br/>
cleaner, and there&#39;s been no resistance to this rule.<br/>
Videos, they just say, &quot;Can I watch a video?&quot; and I<br/>
say sure or I say if your room is clean. This isn&#39;t a<br/>
rule. They just always have asked.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> this is about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the older kids 14,12,10 then we have a 2 and 9mo<br/>
&gt; they help me out with alot!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have way too many people in your family to do all<br/>
the housework on your own! They need to help! It might<br/>
work better if they each had areas of responsibility<br/>
so you didn&#39;t have to nag them. My son is in charge of<br/>
keeping the living room tidy. He also sweeps the<br/>
kitchen after dinner each night (we all contribute to<br/>
the meal: I cook, dh does dishes, dd sets and cleans <br/>
the table). And during reading aloud, he folds one<br/>
basket of laundry. My daughter feeds the pets, sets<br/>
and cleans the table, and is in charge of keeping the<br/>
dining room tidy. The kids have their own bathroom,<br/>
and I just point out when it&#39;s trashed. I do the<br/>
toilet cleaning and stuff, but they have to pick up<br/>
their own bath toys and towels and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; how do you balance house keeping with everything<br/>
&gt; else and are your children self motivated in any way<br/>
&gt; to help with the house? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re not self-motivated, but neither am I. :)<br/>
Not about housework. They just know their areas of<br/>
responsibility. Sure, I sometimes have to say, listen,<br/>
your dining room is messy. <br/>
<br/>
Hope any of this helps. Juli<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; what exatly does your family do on a daily basis and are your children <br/>
required to help around the house?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     I understand why you want specifics so here goes...we have five boys, <br/>
ages almost 17, almost 13 and again, 9, and 4.  They all have to help around <br/>
the house, although the older three do a lot more.  We have tried many <br/>
different approaches, including the one where we just do things as we see <br/>
they need to be done, but we ended up going back to our chore cards.  I cut <br/>
index cards in fourths and wrote every chore I could think of, including ones <br/>
that always got skipped before.  Three days a week, we have to pick 6 of the <br/>
cards.  The other days, we just do the bare minimum.  None of us like <br/>
housework much but we all agree that the house has a depressing atmosphere <br/>
when it&#39;s messy so we just try to find the easiest way.<br/>
     We have separate laundry hampers for me, Matt (their Dad), each of the <br/>
three oldest, and then the 9 and 4 yr olds share one.  I wash mine, often my <br/>
husband&#39;s, and usually the youngests&#39;, although sometimes I&#39;ll tell one of <br/>
the older kids to stick their clothes in the washer.  The older ones wash and <br/>
put away their own clothes and that is one thing I don&#39;t have to tell them to <br/>
do because they find themselves running out of clothes.  We also each have <br/>
our own dish colors (we have those solid color ones) so the three older ones <br/>
wash their own and sometimes I&#39;ll say to wash Sean&#39;s or Ryan&#39;s with theirs <br/>
(those are my two youngest).<br/>
     I would probably have my 9 yr old help more but he is very delayed in <br/>
his fine motor skills and also in some of his overall logic so I have to <br/>
choose things that he can handle.  However, he is getting better at <br/>
understanding things.<br/>
     We have TVs but we don&#39;t have cable or satellite so we only watch movies <br/>
and not very often, except for my younger two.  With them, I do sometimes <br/>
limit it to one movie a day because I have found that my 9 yr old doesn&#39;t do <br/>
well with too much TV/movie viewing and would watch it all day if I let him.  <br/>
We also limit video games to a couple of times a week.<br/>
     We used to go to bed later and get up later but lately we&#39;ve been going <br/>
to bed by about 9 and getting up between 5:30 and 6:30.  This is something I <br/>
pushed but only for a few days until the new mental alarm clock kicked in.  I <br/>
told the kids that I felt like it was a waste for us to be burning the lights <br/>
late into the night and then sleeping through some of the morning light, plus <br/>
I have read that it&#39;s healthier for people to go with the natural light and <br/>
dark cycles because it goes with our natural melatonin production.  And we <br/>
all do feel a lot better this way now that we&#39;re used to it.  Plus my husband <br/>
gets to see us before going off to work, on the days he works.<br/>
     All of this probably sounds too regimented but the reality of it doesn&#39;t <br/>
have that feeling.  I basically believe in giving kids a lot of blank, open <br/>
time because they naturally fill it in with things that interest them.  But I <br/>
find that TV can mess up this process and has a hypnotic effect, so that <br/>
days/weeks/months can go by watching things you could actually care less <br/>
about.  I have experienced this with myself when we had TV and I&#39;m not even a <br/>
TV lover.<br/>
     These are just our ways of doing things, not what I think everyone needs <br/>
to do.  We all try for what works best for our personalities, ways of living, <br/>
etc.  But since you asked for specifics, that&#39;s what I aimed for.  Sorry so <br/>
long!<br/>

kids are only 4 and 6.&nbsp; They love to be read to.&nbsp; They love to play 
with their many toys.&nbsp; They LOVE to do crafts and make quite a mess.&nbsp; 
I do ask them to help pick up esp. when things get too deep.&nbsp; If they ask 
me to play a game (we play Life about 6 times a day at my 6 yos request,) I will 
play if the house is not completely destroyed.&nbsp; When they have the 
motivation (want me to play a game) they pick up really fast.&nbsp; It works 
best of course if you don&#39;t let it get too messy to begin with.&nbsp;I try to 
have them pick up a bit each&nbsp;night before bed.  I refuse to be a crab about 
it, but if their is something I specifically want done, I just ask in a polite 
manner and they do not usually refuse.&nbsp; Both my dh and my kids do best with 
specific instructions.&nbsp;For example: &quot;Would you please take the trash 
out.&quot;&nbsp; I have stopped expecting things to get done without my asking, even 
from my husband.&nbsp; He just doesn&#39;t see the same thing I see through my eyes, 
but he always obliges me if I ask him to help with a specific task.&nbsp;

clean the bathrooms, vacuum, dust (bi-annually), do the dishes. The kids clear 
their places at the table and help pick up their rooms when they get too deep. I 
am not too anal about their rooms as I figure they are *their* rooms.&nbsp; But 
since they want me to&nbsp;lay with them while they fall asleep, I require a 
path to the bed.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I try to find a happy medium in all 
things.&nbsp; I want the kids to learn some responsibility, but I want them to 
be able to be kids for as long as possible.&nbsp; I think they will learn from 
my example even if I don&#39;t make them clean very much as kids.&nbsp; I try my 
best to do the house chores with a happy heart.&nbsp; I try to live in the 
moment and take pride in everything I do, even if it is cleaning the 
toilet.</span></font></div>

<br>and &nbsp;maybe getting ideas. 
<br>
<br>Last year, my daughter went to a Montessori school and decided to homeschool 
<br>again this year but wanted a curriculum. I did buy her Oak Meadow which she 
<br>enjoyed for a time, but then we got involved with an unschooling group here 
<br>that she goes twice a week to. They are free to choose whatever activities 
<br>they want to do so that exposed her again to unschooling and now she has 
<br>abandoned the curriculum in order to unshcool. Her interest right now are in 
<br>dogs and in training them. . .she will be getting a dog this summer and so is 
<br>learning all she can about that. She started a newsletter for her unschool 
<br>group, and is planning on volunteering with a &nbsp;vet next year. I have a 21 
<br>month old that she spends a lot of time playing with, and we go to the park 
<br>often, and talk a lot. She watches some TV, and is very interested in music 
<br>(singing) but is backing off from that a bit. We have no typical days. . . 
<br>she likes to keep her room clean and helps out a lot around the house, and is 
<br>happy to do so. (I know I know. . . I am very lucky!! :)
<br>
<br>We are moving to a place with 2 plus acres in the summer so I am really 
<br>looking forward to doing a lot outside with the kids then. I plan on building 
<br>a greenhouse and growing food year round. 
<br>
<br>The only thing I worry about occasionally is that she hates math and is not 
<br>at all interested in it. That is fine with me, except now there is a 
<br>possibility she will go to college and so I am having to let go of this idea 
<br>that I need to teach her math. She will learn it when she needs to, and she 
<br>will learn what she is interested in.

<br>Hi Rachel,
<br>
<br>I recently moved here to Philadelphia. This unschooling group was begun many 
<br>years ago by a husband and wife named Peter Bergman and Susan Shilock. They 
<br>are Holt devotee&#39;s who have 5 or 6 children and have backgrounds in child 
<br>development when they found out about Holt, et al. 
<br>

<br>merely the future come to life.&quot;
<br>
<br>I moved here to PA with my new husband (after living all my life in the

<br>something close to it) is worth the sacrifices I have made. Whenever I think 
<br>about moving away from here, I cannot imagine going back to a place where I 
<br>don&#39;t experience this kind of support. 
<br>
<br>My husband just read your question and he said. . . well, we don&#39;t do 
<br>anything exactly in unschooling, right? :) He is learning about it as we go 
<br>along, albeit a bit reluctantly at first. His parents are retired 
<br>schoolteachers (over 35 years). 
<br>
<br>Anyway, a bit long winded I know, but I hope it explains it somewhat.

<br>Actually Rachel. . . I don&#39;t believe in &quot;luck&quot; per se, so I cannot consider 
<br>myself that. I believe we create the situations in our lives. I know I 
<br>envisioned such a place as this and would have begun it had I not found it
