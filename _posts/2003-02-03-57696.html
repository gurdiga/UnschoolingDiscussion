<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009568350">Has anybody seen or used the cd-rom that Calvert School produces called King<br/>
Arthur Through the Ages?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds great in its description, like it isn&#39;t set up with proper<br/>
lessons, but information that can just be read or used however.  I&#39;m<br/>
interested to know if that&#39;s true.  Also, is it Mac compatible?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!<br/>
