<div id="ygrps-yiv-746983203">This morning I have e-mail from Holly, titled &quot;Hope you get this in the  <br/>
morning: <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;while I was playing Halo, one of my bottom bands broke off of the braket,  <br/>
and so I was hoping maybe you could make an opointment at the Ortho for the  <br/>
after-noon (or morning I can wake up) and I would have to go before we leave to  <br/>
algodoness (also maybe if i go in then I won&#39;t have to go on monday) we&#39;ll  <br/>
see.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
She misspelled &quot;Algodones,&quot; but it&#39;s Spanish so that&#39;s okay for now.   She <br/>
misspelled a few other things, and was funky with capitalization, but it was  an <br/>
e-mail to her mom in the middle of the night so no biggie.  And after  having <br/>
dealt with hundreds of kids her age when I was teaching Jr. High English,  I <br/>
know she could&#39;ve cleaned it up if she&#39;d wanted to.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve made her an appointment for 1:15, and this means she won&#39;t have to  <br/>
leave the museum on Monday for the pre-England ortho appt. she had scheduled.  <br/>
(Diana, Hannah and Hayden will be here and Marty never works on Mondays so  wants <br/>
to take Diana/HaHaMommy&#39;s kids to Explora) <br/>
 <br/>
I love e-mail.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby was gone all night last weekend, unexpectedly, and when I woke up and  <br/>
he wasn&#39;t back, I checked e-mail.  No e-mail.  That happened once  before, <br/>
when he stayed where the internet connection was down.  He was  young then, he&#39;s <br/>
18 now, and I wasn&#39;t worried.  He called at noon,  apologizing.  I asked if <br/>
they didn&#39;t have e-mail, and he said he fell  asleep without realizing it and <br/>
had just woken up. New gaming friends, from a  gaming shop other than the one he <br/>
worked in for so long, and they&#39;re not on this  side of town.  <br/>
Understandable, as they played until the shop closed and  went to a house to play some more. <br/>
 Sober and geeky and not in  danger.<br/>
