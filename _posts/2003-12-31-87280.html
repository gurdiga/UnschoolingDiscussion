before I met a teacher I absolutely could not work with.  Fortunately I was <br/>
able to transfer to another center.  <br/>
  Among the things that made me crazy was her inability to compose a memo.  I <br/>
got ahold of a two paragraph letter she sent to the parents.  Unfortunately I <br/>
didn&#39;t see it until it was already sent out.  It had 13 mistakes in it.  I <br/>
took it to the office and said to the room at large, &quot;Did you SEE this thing?  I <br/>
don&#39;t know who wrote it and I don&#39;t want to know, but it has 13 mistakes in <br/>
it!  We&#39;re supposed to be teachers here!&quot;<br/>
  Obviously I could&#39;ve been more diplomatic, but sometimes I get fired up and <br/>
away I go.  Anyway.....One of the social workers took a look at it and said <br/>
smugly, &quot;Well, I can only see eight.&quot;<br/>
  OH, well, then, I guess we&#39;re still under the legal limit...??<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve met very few good teachers.  Lots meant well, and were nice people, <br/>
but not great teachers.  Some were mean.  Some were clueless.  Once the idea of <br/>
homeschooling began to percolate, I had to get out for good.<br/>
  Yes, I can very easily see that someone with a background in education <br/>
might have difficulties with unschooling.  Especially if you really BELIEVE in the <br/>
school system.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I worked as an Associate Teacher at Head Start for over 10 years <br/>
before I met a teacher I absolutely could not work with.  Fortunately I was <br/>
able to transfer to another center.  <br/>
  Among the things that made me crazy was her inability to compose a memo.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was an English major and minored in psychology and anthropology (didn&#39;t <br/>
decide until the end, and finished up both in my indecisiveness).    The <br/>
education classes were like another minor.  They were lame classes for the most part, <br/>
and when people in the other departments talked about education it was with <br/>
derision.  I was defensive at first, but I relaxed and tried to really see what <br/>
they were seeing, and some of it was, truly, watered down nothing.<br/>
<br/>
When I took graduate classes in education they were often really truly lame.  <br/>
They were designed to help teachers be recertified.  They were glorified book <br/>
reports, or they were summaries of recent research and legalities.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a few years back spoke to a class of PhD students in education.   One of <br/>
the &quot;study groups&quot; was doing a presentation on Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of <br/>
Learning and Forgetting,&quot; and I was brought in as a speciman of someone who was <br/>
actually practicing that sort of education.   <br/>
<br/>
The group&#39;s lead passed out an outline summary of the book, to the others in <br/>
the class, and then proceeded to read it aloud to them.    <br/>
<br/>
Nobody in the class was under the age of 40.<br/>
Everybody in the class had a master&#39;s degree in education and was working in <br/>
administration.<br/>
<br/>
They were going to sit and read along as someone read to them the outline of <br/>
a book they all should have read anyway, and could have read in just a few <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
I interrupted theatrically and said she couldn&#39;t possibly intend to read that <br/>
outline, when they went directly against the book&#39;s principles, and I <br/>
launched into a talk on the book&#39;s principles.   <br/>
<br/>
I was in medieval costume that day, partly for the presentation and partly <br/>
because I was doing something two buildings over, OUTSIDE, at the university, <br/>
where a hundred people were in costume, doing music, fencing, and I had told <br/>
this group of educators that if they walked that way to their cars when their <br/>
class was over they could see LOTS of people learning in the way Frank Smith was <br/>
recommending.<br/>
<br/>
You can probably guess how many of those 30 or so people bothered to walk to <br/>
the parking lot that way.<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn&#39;t have gotten credit or a better grade for learning something.    <br/>
<br/>
Zero.<br/>
<br/>
They weren&#39;t there to learn.  They were there to get a PhD.<br/>
<br/>
All those years of teaching to the test, and helping kids make good grades <br/>
and good test scores had sunken to the bone with them.<br/>
<br/>
But they were experts, and I was just a mom.<br/>

a rolling my eyes icon here.) Truly unbelievable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>          Yes, it boggles the mind! My master&#39;s was educational media and <br/>
instructional design, way back pre-computer. <br/>
<br/>
       The program of study involved so much &quot;doing&quot; outside of class, like <br/>
storyboarding and scripting, photography and darkroom techniques, tv <br/>
production, etc. and yet you&#39;d never have known it from the class sessions, which were <br/>
taught just like every other academic course. Talking heads lecturing on the <br/>
text, no creative -- or even mildly interesting -- use of instructional media.<br/>
<br/>
       OTOH, I wasn&#39;t the only student who saw the irony or was disappointed <br/>
by it. We endeavored to rise above it outside of class. &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>
