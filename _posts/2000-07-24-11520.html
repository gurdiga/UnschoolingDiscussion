<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi all. Just wanted to let you know that our 
littlest darling (2 yo Casey) had surgery-ear tubes-this morning. All went well 
and she came through with flying colors. We were home from the hospital by 9:30 
a.m. The only thing that was a prob. was that she couldn&#39;t nurse after midnight, 
so when she wanted to at 3 am she got really upset. In her anger she manged to 
wake up fully and kept us up from that point on. I&#39;m typing this at 1:30 pm and 
it feels like the end of the day. I&#39;ve already had a 2 hr. nap. :)</font></div>
