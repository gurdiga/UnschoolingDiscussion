<div id="ygrps-yiv-102793634">Sandra, thank you so much for posting that! <br/>
<br/>
Your style of writing is so direct and easy to understand. I went to al-anon <br/>
for awhile and never heard about the reparenting thing, but it&#39;s sort of what <br/>
I&#39;ve been doing! I had never heard of it before so it&#39;s so validating to hear <br/>
about it. I just sorta figured that as my son grows, I&#39;ll be reminded and put <br/>
in touch with all the yucky stuff from my own childhood, at each age and <br/>
step. And taking different routes and making different choices is healing for <br/>
me, and gives me great confidence that I&#39;m not repeating the pattern onto my <br/>
own child.<br/>
<br/>
I have also found that I do repeat my own patterns unless I&#39;m being <br/>
conscious. I cannot make different choices if I&#39;m not actively working on my <br/>
issues, and while I&#39;m giving my son everything I can, he&#39;s giving me more <br/>
than I ever dreamed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you and share a bit. I&#39;m not that great at <br/>
articulating my own thoughts and process so hope it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to add that al-anon produces lots of literature. You can attend <br/>
one meeting and take a few books home with no pressure. I have two little day <br/>
by day books that I read from time to time. Esp. the &#39;courage to change&#39; <br/>
book. While I&#39;m no longer in psycho relationships, ideas like detachment from <br/>
outcomes, gratitude, self-love, etc. are always good reminders.<br/>
<br/>
I also learned a lot from a book called &#39;It could never happen to me&quot; by <br/>
Claudia Black. Really outlined the different routes of behavior taken by <br/>
children in homes with addiction, from the unproductive addict to the super <br/>
achiever workaholic.<br/>
