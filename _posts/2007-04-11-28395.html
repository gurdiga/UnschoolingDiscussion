<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893243287">Marty told a joke in front of several people the other day and I  <br/>
laughed, and he reminded me I was the one who had told it to him.  It  <br/>
was &quot;What does a Grateful Dead fan say when he&#39;s not stoned?&quot;  &quot;This  <br/>
music sucks!&quot;  (Just because I&#39;ve heard it, and I had told it, didn&#39;t  <br/>
keep it from being funny.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the performances and recordings were unpolished, but some of  <br/>
the lyrics are sterling.  So I&#39;ve brought this as an example of  <br/>
simple Anglo-Saxon English and deep thought.  I&#39;m not sure whether  <br/>
the links will come through, but it&#39;s from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/">http://arts.ucsc.edu/gdead/</a> <br/>
agdl/atti.html and there&#39;s reference to a 14th century poem (among  <br/>
other things).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an article that was brought to the UnschoolingDiscussion list  <br/>
the other day, and I linked it and commented here.  It&#39;s about  <br/>
wonder.  So is this song.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/duckford/judgment">http://sandradodd.com/duckford/judgment</a><br/>

&quot;I have spent my life Seeking all that&#39;s still unsung&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Annotated &quot;Attics of My Life&quot;<br/>

&quot;Attics of My Life&quot;<br/>
Words by Robert Hunter; music by Jerry Garcia<br/>

<br/>
In the attics of my life<br/>
Full of cloudy dreams unreal<br/>
Full of tastes no tongue can know<br/>
And lights no eye can see<br/>
When there was no ear to hear<br/>
You sang to me<br/>
I have spent my life<br/>
Seeking all that&#39;s still unsung<br/>
Bent my ear to hear the tune<br/>
And closed my eyes to see<br/>
When there were no strings to play<br/>
You played to me<br/>
<br/>
In the book of love&#39;s own dream<br/>
Where all the print is blood<br/>
Where all the pages are my days<br/>
And all my lights grow old<br/>
When I had no wings to fly<br/>
You flew to me<br/>
<br/>
You<br/>
flew<br/>
to me<br/>
<br/>
In the secret space of dreams<br/>
Where I dreaming lay amazed<br/>
When the secrets all are told<br/>
And the petals all unfold<br/>
When there was no dream of mine<br/>
You dreamed of me<br/>

I&#39;m thinking (trying to think) that probably I heard that from Ben  <br/>
Lovejoy.  Maybe Marty heard it from Ben too.  Maybe my memory isn&#39;t  <br/>
so horrible.  (No, it is. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
