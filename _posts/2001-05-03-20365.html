<div id="ygrps-yiv-290335894">I respect my children as people, but there are times I have physically disciplined them. I am not talking about beating or abusing a child, that is a different subject. When a child stamps his foot at you and screams no to something that is his rightful responsibility, as a parent you need to deal with it. spanking is reserved for severe offenses of boundaries. Picking, teasing and bullying are different subjects. No one should be subjected to these. They are selfishly motivated. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380322563">I am astounded at the ridicule of the Proverb &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the<br/>
child&quot;.  As parents we are commanded by God to be responsible for the<br/>
upbringing of our child.  This includes discipline.  Does it mean to &quot;beat&quot;<br/>
them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from disobeying.  That<br/>
sometimes means using a physical form of correction.  Please give me one<br/>
example of a child that was &quot;spanked&quot; as means of correcting that has been<br/>
emotionally damaged.  I am not talking about those cases of abuse.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains at all to the<br/>
disallowing of a child to attend ps for fear of the bullying he/she will<br/>
experience. &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains to Biblical discipline<br/>
of our children.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not a Biblical quote, neither new nor old.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of hitting our children, as a way to punish, does not originate<br/>
with the Jewish people.<br/>
<br/>
There are many, Christian and nonChristian, who do not believe hitting our<br/>
children should be an acceptable practice. (espeically when we hit one<br/>
another it&#39;s called &quot;assault and battery&quot;)  I have known many adults who<br/>
believe the &#39;spankings&#39; they recieved as children harmed them, and the harm<br/>
will always be apart of them, even as they heal.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, remember not all of us here are Christians, so what seems to be<br/>
ridicule to one is just a statement of fact to another.  ;)<br/>

punishment, but I&#39;d just like to let anyone know who is interested <br/>
that I have a webpage for Christians about why spanking and <br/>
corporeal punishment is not Biblical, explaining it with scripture.  <br/>

Also, I personally believe that punishment is not in keeping with the <br/>
whole idea of unschooling.  Let the consequences of their own <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937663070">Now, before everyone gets their bloomers in a bunch, this is NOT<br/>
anti-Christian, so if anyone can&#39;t read what I am WRITING, not what their<br/>
preconceived notions are, please delete here.<br/>
<br/>
This is one more &quot;proverb&quot; that has gotten twisted compliments, IMHO, of<br/>
that old phenomenon a good example of which is the game children play called<br/>
&quot;Telephone, Telegraph&quot; inwhich what was originally written or spoken is no<br/>
longer recognizable when it gets to the end of the line.<br/>
<br/>
The rod as originally used in the Bible from which folks supposedly got this<br/>
saying refers to the staff that shepherds used to herd their sheep.  It was<br/>
never used to hit anything except in defense of the flock.  Sooooo, as<br/>
originally intended, the rod as used was a form of guidance and had nothing<br/>
to do punishment.  Shepherds did NOT punish their sheep, they guided them<br/>
and kept them out of trouble and protected them from attacks.  It was used<br/>
as an extension of the shepherds arm, it was used to help the shepherd get<br/>
up steep hills, it was used to rescue stupid sheep and it was used to stop<br/>
them from doing stupid things like running off a cliff, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if someone wants to use &quot;the rod&quot; as it was intended, go for it.  Any<br/>
other use, such as corporal punishment, would not be the intended use nor<br/>
the intention of the original proverb which meant GUIDE your child and<br/>
protect them from themselves and others.<br/>

&gt; I am astounded at the ridicule of the Proverb &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the<br/>
&gt; child&quot;.  As parents we are commanded by God to be responsible for the<br/>

&quot;beat&quot;<br/>
&gt; them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from disobeying.  That<br/>
&gt; sometimes means using a physical form of correction.  Please give me one<br/>
&gt; example of a child that was &quot;spanked&quot; as means of correcting that has been<br/>
&gt; emotionally damaged.  I am not talking about those cases of abuse.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; pertains at all to the<br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; don&#39;t think it did me a damned bit of good.  I could<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8749794">The Bible also says, &quot;Treat others as you would like to be treated.&quot;  I<br/>
have never thought to myself, &quot;Shoot, I got out of my seat a little too<br/>
early, guess I&#39;m in need of a spanking.&quot;  Reminds me of a bad porno.<br/>
<br/>
I would never use the bible as an excuse to physically harm another<br/>
being.  Can you really see Jesus Christ taking off his belt and whacking<br/>
the little children?  I was only spanked once.  I remember it vividly.<br/>
It was your traditional spanking, I was about four, and it did cause me<br/>
some serious distress.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is my obligation and special privilege to teach a child<br/>
through actions.  I have no desire to say, &quot;Do as I say, not as I do.&quot;<br/>
Showing a child that spanking is a great form of punishment teaches that<br/>
violent acts are okay, talking something out is not important, parents<br/>
are not friends or confidants, and that one is not in control of one&#39;s<br/>
own body.  Nice behavior begets nice behavior.  Hitting a child teaches<br/>
a child it is okay to hit another being.<br/>
<br/>
How can you raise an empowered child, a child that can say, &quot;NO!  Don&#39;t<br/>
touch me there!&quot;  when the child&#39;s own parents find it acceptable to hit<br/>
this same child on a very private part of their body?<br/>
<br/>
I have never hit my dogs, and they are lovely animals...very well<br/>
behaved.  Why would I treat a child worse than a dog?<br/>

<br/>
Disciple means teach.  Since MANY, MANY people are raising wonderful<br/>
people without spanking them as children the idea that spanking is needed<br/>
cannot be supported.  If it is not needed why would anyone choose to<br/>
spank?<br/>
<br/>
ALL religions which use the Bible as their source are selective about<br/>
which scriptures they adhere to most closely.  There are many more<br/>
references to selling your stuff, living simply and giving most of what<br/>
you have away.  I meet MANY folks who seem comfortable with ignoring<br/>
these verses and yet feel commanded to hit their children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does it mean to &quot;beat&quot;<br/>
them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from disobeying.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the Bible says &quot;BEAT&quot;.  I believe that God has brought me,<br/>
through Jesus, into a relationship of friendship with Him (it&#39;s in the<br/>
Bible) and is an example of how I should live with my children.  I have<br/>
not had to hit them to get their cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, if the motivation is external it isn&#39;t real.  People<br/>
overcome their fears.  I would rather know that my children cooperate<br/>
with me because it is what they truly believe and feel.  If I&#39;m doing my<br/>
job, my example should be enough to convince them of appropriate<br/>
behavior.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018736590">Thanks Misty.  I am so totally against violence except in self <br/>
defense.  We were sucked into the whole control your kids thing from <br/>
the day they were born.  It never did and never will work and it took <br/>
me a few years, unfortunately, to figure out that they are people <br/>
with feelings like me.  It never felt right and I never felt like I <br/>
was helping them, only hurting.  I finally told my guys that I would <br/>
never hurt them again and that there is no excuse for violence and no <br/>
one EVER deserves to be hit or injured, no matter the offense. <br/>

In an earlier post, when I stated that something only &quot;spoils when <br/>
left to rot&quot;, I hope everyone knew I was refering to physical <br/>
affection and attention, not discipline.<br/>

were &quot;emotionally damaged&quot; as a result of &quot;physical correction&quot; as <br/>
youngsters. Hitting a child, an animal, or any living being is behavior that <br/>
only speaks about control . . . you, the hitter, needing to control another <br/>
being for some reason.<br/>

&gt;   &lt;&lt; Perhaps if I had not been subjected to the horrors of<br/>
&gt;   &quot;socialization&quot; in public schools I would not have<br/>
&gt;   been such a profoundly unhappy and deeply terrified<br/>

&gt;   I was the child who had a great home life and it DID make the<br/>
&gt;   &quot;socialization&quot; of school more bearable.  It was STILL <br/>
unnecessary and I<br/>
&gt;   think I would have weathered some genetic problems with anxiety <br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   depression much better had I been schooled at home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The idea that children will learn to handle their emotional <br/>
sensitivities<br/>
&gt;   by being bullied and humiliated is ludicrous in the extreme.  <br/>
It&#39;s like<br/>
&gt;   saying a wounded animal will &quot;learn&quot; to heal if you release in <br/>
the middle<br/>

&quot;physical correction&quot; who couldn&#39;t have come up with a much better way to <br/>

irritation and anger.  I have also noticed that kids who have been hit <br/>
sometimes hit other kids in a way that mimics the parents&#39; hitting of them.  <br/>
     I just don&#39;t understand why parents feel a need to use varying degrees <br/>
of physical pain inflicted on a child as a discipline method.  Disciplining <br/>
is actually supposed to mean teaching, as people can tell from the other <br/>
related word, disciple.  What is the instance in which hitting HAS to be used <br/>
or is better than any other alternative?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241410613">Hi Kate,<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind telling me which Proverbs that is? Does it actually <br/>
say, &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child?&quot; I was told that it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The Biblical passages are deciphered differently by different people. <br/>
I for one do not take it so literally. I can NOT imagine Jesus <br/>
hitting a child, whether He called it spanking or something else.<br/>
<br/>
I never felt that hitting/spanking a child was a civilized way of <br/>
teaching them right from wrong. I preferred communication. I was <br/>
spanked as a child, not &#39;abused.&#39; I suffered from it, and no it <br/>
wasn&#39;t often and it wasn&#39;t with great force. It was simply total <br/>
humiliation. Spanking IMO is something that is used when patience is <br/>
lost and words can&#39;t be found. Listening, REALLY listening to Laurie  <br/>
worked better than using the spanking/powertrip thing...not that I <br/>
ever resorted to hitting her.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

picture of Jesus hitting a child. I can remember crying my eyes out <br/>
because my brothers got a spanking. I was six, in the car, and we <br/>
were on the interstate. They were arguing and Dad pulled over and in <br/>
front of everyone on the interstate (he took them out of the car) he <br/>
spanked them. I was so humiliated for them. I would say this was a <br/>
bad effect from spanking...if I can remember it so vividly 40 years <br/>
later.<br/>

&gt; have never thought to myself, &quot;Shoot, I got out of my seat a little <br/>
too<br/>
&gt; early, guess I&#39;m in need of a spanking.&quot;  Reminds me of a bad porno.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would never use the bible as an excuse to physically harm another<br/>

whacking<br/>
&gt; the little children?  I was only spanked once.  I remember it <br/>
vividly.<br/>
&gt; It was your traditional spanking, I was about four, and it did <br/>
cause me<br/>
&gt; some serious distress.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe it is my obligation and special privilege to teach a child<br/>
&gt; through actions.  I have no desire to say, &quot;Do as I say, not as I <br/>
do.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Showing a child that spanking is a great form of punishment teaches <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; violent acts are okay, talking something out is not important, <br/>
parents<br/>
&gt; are not friends or confidants, and that one is not in control of <br/>
one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; own body.  Nice behavior begets nice behavior.  Hitting a child <br/>
teaches<br/>
&gt; a child it is okay to hit another being.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can you raise an empowered child, a child that can say, &quot;NO!  <br/>
Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; touch me there!&quot;  when the child&#39;s own parents find it acceptable <br/>
to hit<br/>
&gt; this same child on a very private part of their body?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have never hit my dogs, and they are lovely animals...very well<br/>
&gt; behaved.  Why would I treat a child worse than a dog?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Disciple means teach.  Since MANY, MANY people are raising wonderful<br/>
&gt; people without spanking them as children the idea that spanking is <br/>
needed<br/>
&gt; cannot be supported.  If it is not needed why would anyone choose to<br/>
&gt; spank?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ALL religions which use the Bible as their source are selective <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; which scriptures they adhere to most closely.  There are many more<br/>
&gt; references to selling your stuff, living simply and giving most of <br/>
what<br/>
&gt; you have away.  I meet MANY folks who seem comfortable with ignoring<br/>
&gt; these verses and yet feel commanded to hit their children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Does it mean to &quot;beat&quot;<br/>
&gt; them?  NO! It means to correct and discourage them from <br/>
disobeying.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, the Bible says &quot;BEAT&quot;.  I believe that God has brought me,<br/>
&gt; through Jesus, into a relationship of friendship with Him (it&#39;s in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Bible) and is an example of how I should live with my children.  I <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; not had to hit them to get their cooperation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep in mind, if the motivation is external it isn&#39;t real.  People<br/>
&gt; overcome their fears.  I would rather know that my children <br/>
cooperate<br/>
&gt; with me because it is what they truly believe and feel.  If I&#39;m <br/>
doing my<br/>
&gt; job, my example should be enough to convince them of appropriate<br/>
&gt; behavior.<br/>

issue, <br/>
&gt; but there is one thing noone ever mentions when it is raised on <br/>
&gt; mailing lists, and which I believe is of significant importance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The argument is generally over whether hitting kids--in whatever <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; their parents have decided is acceptable--is &quot;good for them&quot;.  <br/>
Those <br/>
&gt; in favor of it often say or at least imply that it &quot;teaches them&quot; <br/>
&gt; something or somehow builds their character in a way that no <br/>
&gt; non-violent approach could.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The fact is that there are, and have been throughout recorded <br/>
&gt; history, entire CULTURES that flourished in peace and plenty <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; anyone striking or otherwise dominating their children.  Most of <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; were not at all violent, though some produced formidable warriors. <br/>
&gt; They tended to exhibit more interpersonal respect in general than <br/>
&gt; cultures that make &quot;exceptions&quot; to the &quot;whacking people is bad&quot; <br/>
rule. <br/>
&gt;  .women and elders, for instance, were generally valued as equal <br/>
&gt; members of the society, despite the fact that they were by and <br/>
large <br/>
&gt; less equipped to be whackers than whackees.  When those that no <br/>
&gt; longer exist ceased to do so, it was usually due to some external <br/>
&gt; force.  The members of those cultures were capable of resolving <br/>
&gt; conflicts without bloody revolutions or acts of terrorism, and <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; societies didn&#39;t rip themselves apart.  They weren&#39;t people who <br/>
felt <br/>
&gt; that all power flows from the barrel of a gun (or the equivalent), <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; part because physical strength or its lack had never been held up <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; them as the limiting factor in their rights.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don&#39;t believe me, feel free to investigate for yourself. <br/>
&gt; Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Marija Gimbutas leap to mind as <br/>
&gt; early researchers in the area, but there are more recent works you <br/>
&gt; could look at.  Many extant Native American cultures view violence <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; any kind against children as deplorable, as do members of at least <br/>
&gt; some Indian castes.  I&#39;m not positive, but I think the Quakers <br/>
share <br/>
&gt; that opinion.  Perhaps you could do some reading or find a member <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; such a group to discuss things with.  Finding out what childhood is <br/>
&gt; like and how interactions between adults are different in societies <br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t rely on &quot;might makes right&quot; in parenting is a real <br/>
&gt; eye-opener.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The rod as originally used in the Bible from which folks supposedly <br/>
got this<br/>

sheep.  It was<br/>
&gt; never used to hit anything except in defense of the flock.  Sooooo, <br/>
as<br/>
&gt; originally intended, the rod as used was a form of guidance and had <br/>
nothing<br/>
&gt; to do punishment.  Shepherds did NOT punish their sheep, they <br/>
guided them<br/>
&gt; and kept them out of trouble and protected them from attacks.  It <br/>
was used<br/>
&gt; as an extension of the shepherds arm, it was used to help the <br/>
shepherd get<br/>
&gt; up steep hills, it was used to rescue stupid sheep and it was used <br/>
to stop<br/>
&gt; them from doing stupid things like running off a cliff, for example.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, if someone wants to use &quot;the rod&quot; as it was intended, go for <br/>
it.  Any<br/>
&gt; other use, such as corporal punishment, would not be the intended <br/>
use nor<br/>
&gt; the intention of the original proverb which meant GUIDE your child <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; protect them from themselves and others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617183848">Okay... I wasn&#39;t going to put anything in the book about spanking <br/>
because it is so controversial. Now I am tempted to ask permission <br/>
from each of you anti-spanking people to quote your posts. I could <br/>
put your name in the book under it and you&#39;d be famous too!!!<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

&gt; &gt; NO! It means to correct and discourage them from disobeying.  That<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes means using a physical form of correction.  Please give <br/>
me one<br/>
&gt; &gt; example of a child that was &quot;spanked&quot; as means of correcting that <br/>
has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotionally damaged.  I am not talking about those cases of abuse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Disobeying who? The all knowing parent/teacher/doctor, etc.? I <br/>
prefer a <br/>
&gt; thinking &quot;disobeying&quot; child anyday over one that obeys because the <br/>
older <br/>
&gt; and/or authoritarian person in their life told them so. Children <br/>
don&#39;t need a <br/>
&gt; correction by physical means, nor by any means, except in the case <br/>
of their <br/>
&gt; imminent physical danger, IMO. There are a plethora of examples of <br/>
people who <br/>
&gt; were &quot;emotionally damaged&quot; as a result of &quot;physical correction&quot; as <br/>
&gt; youngsters. Hitting a child, an animal, or any living being is <br/>
behavior that <br/>
&gt; only speaks about control . . . you, the hitter, needing to control <br/>
another <br/>
&gt; being for some reason.<br/>

yourself, and then <br/>
&gt; make a change.<br/>
