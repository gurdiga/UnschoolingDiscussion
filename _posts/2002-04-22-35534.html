<div id="ygrps-yiv-52342905"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you can all stand an idea from a newbie who hasn&#39;t been around very<br/>
&gt; long....but has survived a few &quot;lively&quot; groups in the past....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it helps _me_ to read everything in my mailbox before I reply to anything.<br/>
&gt; That way I don&#39;t say the same thing somebody else does, and I&#39;ve usually<br/>
&gt; calmed down enough to be tactful about the things I do reply to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course, what works for me won&#39;t necessarily work for someone else....!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I do too, most of the time. And I&#39;ve been here since October and<br/>
survived this &quot;extremely lively&quot; group. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s also why I end up lurking and not posting as much.<br/>
By the time I get to the end of posts to read, someone else has already said<br/>
what I would have said, or said it much better! I&#39;ve learned a lot by just<br/>
observing and I especially like the discussions started by newbies asking<br/>
questions.<br/>
These unschooling discussions are what I&#39;m here for. Although sometimes I<br/>
feel as if I&#39;m learning at the expense of others.<br/>
I don&#39;t like the bickering either but I find it&#39;s best to delete and/or<br/>
ignore those types of posts.<br/>
