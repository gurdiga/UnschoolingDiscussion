different influences on her, and I think they were all valuable.<br/>
Especially the Simpsons.    &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
They showed a rerun of King of the Hill last night - it was the WONDERFUL <br/>
Halloween show - where the whole town was kept from celebrating Halloween by <br/>
one fanatical woman and, finally, Hank had had enough and put on his <br/>
trick-or-treat costume from when he was a kid and went walking down the <br/>
street saying, &quot;TRICK OR TREAT TRICK OR TREAT&quot; and all the neighbors came out <br/>
and joined in. This is one of my favorite episodes of any show. The make all <br/>
these comments on all kinds of subjects but still manage to keep the real <br/>
focus on what is important - the relationship between Hank and his son, Bobby <br/>
-- it is really very very insightful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394945479"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I say, &quot;most TV programming is ugly&quot;. You say, &quot;there are wonderful<br/>
 </span></blockquote>shows&quot;. Do you think *most* shows are wonderful? Maybe you do. But you<br/>
will agree that for those people who think most shows are nothing special,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t make sense to own a TV. It just amazes me how many do.   &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have no way of knowing, and I don&#39;t believe that you do either, that &quot;most&quot; <br/>
tv shows are &quot;ugly.&quot; If you&#39;re really going to base your argument on the <br/>
claim that &quot;most&quot; (meaning more than 50 percent) is &quot;ugly&quot; -- and you want us <br/>
to take that claim seriously, then you&#39;re going to have to convince us first, <br/>
that it is true. It isn&#39;t my experience of tv, at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn&#39;t ever watch tv, how would I know that most of it was ugly? Where <br/>
would I get a sample on which to base this assumption? I&#39;d see tv where? <br/>
Hmmm, in the gym when I worked out - they tend to watch soaps or sports - not <br/>
something I watch. On the tv&#39;s in a store I&#39;m walking through - sitcoms and <br/>
sports - again, not my own cup of tea.  So my sample would be based on what <br/>
other people just happened to be watching in public environments. Plus, there <br/>
was a football game on last week that was being played in New England and it <br/>
was snowing like CRAZY. My husband was watching it with his headphones, so <br/>
that I didn&#39;t have to have the background noise, but the picture itself was <br/>
so absolutely gorgeous - all that snow falling (remember I&#39;m in Southern <br/>
California) that I actually sat and watched the game for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the shows I watch are not &quot;ugly&quot;. Because I do like to watch a lot of <br/>
shows that are &quot;artsy&quot; - most of the shows that I watch are not only not <br/>
ugly, they are beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
Okay - I watched South Park last night too. I think it probably qualifies as <br/>
&quot;ugly&quot; in a way. But still -- very very very funny show. So even if &quot;some&quot; <br/>
shows ARE ugly, so what?  Is ugly always bad?<br/>

I don&#39;t think this poster is trying to convince anyone of that point. My take <br/>
on those posts is that she is saying SHE feels that way and that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand why others who do feel that TV is mostly crap would own a TV. You <br/>
-and I - are saying we think many things on TV are wonderful and we like <br/>
owning them.<br/>
<br/>
And if I&#39;m wrong on that, feel free to correct me.<br/>

of Expressionism.  With beauty, skill, and realism, he also challenges<br/>
assumptions and makes you think.  Go figure &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I married a guy who is not nearly as handsome as some of the men I dated,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429940898">&lt;&lt;That doesn&#39;t change<br/>
the fact that for the few families who do experience TV that way,<br/>
following the children&#39;s choices on the matter is not a simple<br/>
decision. I&#39;m not saying that anyone is wrong for arguing in favor of<br/>
unlimited TV. This is an unschooling list after all. I&#39;d just like to<br/>
see a little acknowledgment that this can be a bit more complicated.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people talked about having decided to not allow tv even before their <br/>
children were born, Kathy. So it isn&#39;t that they&#39;ve tried and found their <br/>
kids were in that .1 percent who have an adverse reaction. <br/>
<br/>
I know you and I believe your experience. But nobody else here has said that <br/>
they have had that kind of experience.<br/>
<br/>
Making this argument doesn&#39;t bolster the case of anybody else -- it is like <br/>
someone whose kid is allergic to peanut butter arguing that others are right <br/>
not to allow their kids to eat peanut butter because there are some kids who <br/>
have allergic reactions (and even not that strong since surely the reaction <br/>
to tv will not last into adulthood - so there ought to come a time when they <br/>
can handle it, unlike a peanut allergy).</div>
