Not by any means. What I meant was that his self-education prepared him for<br/>
what he chose, which was college, and he did a good job of it...he was<br/>
curious about what college was like. He discovered that he was good at it.<br/>
If he had chosen to continue either of the jobs he had in his teens or<br/>
something else -- it didn&#39;t matter to us -- that would have been fine with<br/>
Luz and me because we only wanted him to be happy and self-assured.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers need the reassurance that NOT studying school subjects does not<br/>
mean that there is an absence of education. All kids (and adults) have gaps<br/>
in their learning, and the trick is to know that you can learn what you need<br/>
by yourself because that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done all along. That is a higher<br/>
plane, I think, than always waiting to be told what to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If he had asked me whether I wanted him to go to college or if I thought<br/>
college was a good way to spend time and money, I&#39;m sure that my honest<br/>
answer would have been no. But he didn&#39;t ask and I didn&#39;t say, even though I<br/>
believe he knew my feelings anyway - I don&#39;t hide a lot of my views....as<br/>
you might have noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal for him was never college. Now that it&#39;s past, the goal is still<br/>
his happiness, not any other. His self-government and our trust in him have<br/>
so far been the foundation for everything, I believe.<br/>

What schools teach has never had any connection to what children are<br/>
interested in.  -- I forget who said that, probably Holt</div>

attitude of some homeschoolers that doing really well academically is *the* <br/>
proof that homeschooling works.<br/>
