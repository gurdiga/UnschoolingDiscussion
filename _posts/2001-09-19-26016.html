say, &quot;no that is not how we are here.&quot;  I objected to the fact that<br/>
something I said was misconstrued and no amount of my correcting,<br/>
protesting or saying no, that is not it&quot; has made one bit of difference.<br/>
<br/>
I said maybe this is how you are based on what I read.  I am more than<br/>
willing to listen to replies about that.  I&#39;ve seen nothing to dispell my<br/>
belief that many of you had to make a true effort to let go.  I was<br/>
thinking about this yesterday.  I realized that from the day Rachel was<br/>
born, I&#39;ve been different than most about parenting.  The nurses kept<br/>
telling me how and when to do things and I knew it was not right for us. <br/>
I knew that putting her in a crib was not what we should do.  I knew<br/>
feeding on a schedule was not going to work.  I knew that the only person<br/>
who could tell me what Rachel needed was Rachel.  I knew that bedtimes<br/>
were silly and that as long as she was eating, she was getting the<br/>
&#39;right&#39; stuff.  I didn&#39;t have to learn it, I just &#39;knew&#39;.<br/>
My only regret is that I didn&#39;t homeschool from the start.  Our public<br/>
school experience was interesting to say the least.  It did serve to make<br/>
my conviction that individuality is important even stronger.  And it gave<br/>
me a new appreciation for individual learning and the fact that you can&#39;t<br/>
teach something unless the teachee want to learn it.<br/>

and had to have your thinking changed, either by yourself or your children. <br/>
So I&#39;d hesitate to say that this whole lifestyle comes easier to you than <br/>
anyone else. I had a homebirth, extended breastfeeding, family bed, relaxed <br/>
sleep schedule, etc. I have been called more relaxed than a lot of my own <br/>
family and friends, but I still have more to learn and grow. Unschooling is <br/>
still new to me, even though it feels completely right. I was raised in the <br/>
ps system and some things have to be addressed and changed or they will <br/>
continue into my parenting. I don&#39;t think I represent the minority here. I <br/>
think we all have things we need to learn and work on as parents. I&#39;m sure <br/>
there will be lots more stuff, and when I stop being willing to challenge my <br/>
ideas, is where I will stagnate.<br/>
I got the impression from your earlier post that the reason we all don&#39;t get <br/>
how what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t controlling, is that you&#39;re so advanced in <br/>
letting go, we couldn&#39;t understand. Have there been any suggestions/advice <br/>
from this list that you&#39;ve taken off the computer and thought, hmmmm, maybe <br/>
their right, maybe I do need to rethink this.?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549974903">OK guys need to jump in here.  I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s not productive for <br/>
me to read e-mails from people that appear to have emotional <br/>
problems.  I have finally realized (with the pscyological training <br/>
that I&#39;ve had) that continuing to answer a person who picks apart <br/>
everything I written, defends themselves, and basically wants to <br/>
disect everything anyone writes is not actually interested in the <br/>
topics of the list.  <br/>
<br/>
What they are interested in is finding a way to deal with the <br/>
supressed anger they feel inside.  Boundaries that need to be set <br/>
with the appropriate people in their lives.  Therefore it&#39;s easier to <br/>
write to people you don&#39;t actually know in your life and justify, <br/>
defend or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think I can diagnose someone over the internet by what they <br/>
have said in the past 2 weeks????  Think again, it&#39;s something I&#39;m <br/>
very good at.....<br/>
<br/>
So rather than fuel a fire with someone on this list, I&#39;ve decided <br/>
that for me (and that&#39;s the only person I can decide for on this <br/>

answers to questions.<br/>

Brenda&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a 4yo who can be a clinger, particularly when I am really interested<br/>
in an activity  :)  But of course, her attention span isn&#39;t as long as mine<br/>
and here is what we do.<br/>
<br/>
When she wants to stop an activity and wants me to as well I let her know<br/>
that I need to finish and will be done in about &quot;fill in the blank&quot; minutes.<br/>
I offer a couple of activities that she can do without me, usually ones in<br/>
the same room I&#39;m working in.  That way we can still talk  but interact more<br/>
parallel than interactive.<br/>

  Your post made me smile.  I am hoping that venting to you/this list that I<br/>
can regain some perspective and let go.....again :-p   I have begun to push<br/>
in the past.  I know it won&#39;t work.....I guess part of parenting is that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785528727">Good for you Dawn! I&#39;m feeling the same way. I&#39;ve gotten off of here <br/>
irritated a few times lately and today it hit me, I&#39;m spending more time <br/>
bickering over what seems like word play, personal friction and just nothing <br/>
than I am learning about unschooling. I have lots of problems in my life, and <br/>
I think I bait rather easily. <br/>
<br/>
But I too have decided to get back on focus and start more absorbing and <br/>
assimilating unschooling stuff. I don&#39;t know if this is typical of all <br/>
learning, but I personally need to read and discuss and then hibernate for a <br/>
period...to let it sink in and see what fits and doesn&#39;t. When I skip the <br/>
hibernation, it never really sinks in. And with me doing so much bickering, <br/>
I&#39;ve stopped that whole process. And instead of asking, what is such and such <br/>
getting out of this, I have to ask myself what I&#39;m getting out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you wrote that.<br/>

I am so with you on this!  I have no training in psychological <br/>
diagnosis, and I came to these same conclusions awhile back.  I am <br/>
relatively new to this list, and I mostly just read.  I have recently <br/>
considered unsubbing because the tone of the posts just seems so <br/>
surly and ugly and argumentative.<br/>
I must say as well that when I do have some free time to be on the <br/>
computer, in yahoogroups, and on this list, I am stunned at the # of <br/>
posts by some of you all.  Where do you find the time or energy to be <br/>
online so often?<br/>
My kids are one and seven, and I primarily read my egroups while they <br/>
sleep at night.  One year olds don&#39;t leave much free time during the <br/>
day for the computer, I guess!<br/>
Anyway, enough with all the petty, back-biting, nit-picking BS, and <br/>
on with the unschooling support and discussions!!<br/>
