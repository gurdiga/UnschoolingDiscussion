<div id="ygrps-yiv-226527539">When my daughter was 8 she wanted to dye her hair orange, pink and blue. I was trying to explain that once it was in, it would have to stay that way for awhile. This discussion happened in the store while I was looking for hair color and I agreed to let her choose &quot;my color&quot;. Funny thing was when the tub filled with a deep hot pink color, (it was called cinnamon..) her response was &quot;&lt;g&gt;oohhh, never mind, I don&#39;t like it,  just keep rinsing till its gone.&quot;  People thought I was crazy for keeping it in, my mother for one and my boss another. (I was working fulltime) It was fun. It was then that I knew I was not the same as the &quot;other&quot; parents. I was told a child should never have that type of &quot;power&quot; over an adult. What power?!, I let them choose my hair color!?! We were just having fun! A couple of weeks later it washed out. And I was back to being...dare I say...normal?! &lt;g&gt;~We always have such a good laugh we look through the photo album. My fiance thinks we&#39;re a little crazy.  Once while still working I took a day off for a &quot;dress up&quot; day. (needless to say I had a very difficult time with the schools...they said I had to have permission to withdrawal my children in advance...silly people...lol...when will they learn...lol) We called David up at work and invited him to lunch. When he arrived he was greeted by 3 very lovely girls all dressed in my finest bridesmaids and prom dresses from years gone by. Complete with jewelry, gloves and heels. The table was set with candles and fine china. We presented him with a bow tie (from my waitress days) and seated him at the head of the table. The girls prepared the goumet meal...pb&amp;j&#39;s, I think that is the day we truely won his heart! He called in and spent the rest of day with us! We all look forward to spending the rest of our lives together.~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.

Mine went through the pink, blue and purple hair. {even the then 2 year old} I liked the purple the best. It was semi-perm but because they had naturally blonde hair, and the two oldest&#39;s hair had a previous chemical {I&#39;m a cosmetologist and streaked their hair for them} it grabbed. They wore it for a while but got tired of it and I got it out for them. They may try it again later, if so it&#39;s cool with me. There are worst things they could do....Tracy---------------------------------Do you Yahoo!?The New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier. Bingo.[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650549688">Once Holly let a friend&#39;s mom dye her blonde hair black for Halloween.  It <br/>
was a fairly serious rinse that lasted a few weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith the dad was UNamused.  He acted like it was a big deal.  He wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
that way now, though, I&#39;m sure.  He&#39;s survived so many weird hair-things with <br/>
our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
At the moment, Holly (who is watching Tank Girl, again--there&#39;s a clue) has <br/>
her hair about six different lengths.  I&#39;ll post photos of it in a day or <br/>
two.  It&#39;s a sculpted piece of hair-art.  Some parts with shaved designs, <br/>
some hanging down, some sticking up...  She cut some, and directed me where <br/>
to do what.  We spent $20 on a narrow shaving tool to do the designs.  She <br/>
wants the designs changed in a few days.  <br/>
<br/>
I was afraid it would look crazy/stupid, but it&#39;s honestly very cute.  She <br/>
pulls it off because she&#39;s so confident.<br/>

spray-in temporary stuff first, then the second time she wanted to use the <br/>
real stuff. It looked great! But it really only lasts for a few weeks, we <br/>
used the Manic Panic-type stuff and it starts to fade pretty quickly.  She&#39;d <br/>
still like to have purple hair again, but doesn&#39;t want to sit still long <br/>
enough for me to &quot;make it all goopy&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
Most people around here don&#39;t bat an eye about different hair colors, and <br/>
she got a lot of compliments. A pair of old ladies at church told her she <br/>
looked just like a rainbow fairy, I thought that was nice.<br/>

a lighter tone after washings, then she has a lighter tone, right?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453098419">Maybe pertect her hair with leaving some conditioner in her hair before you do it. That might help it from seeping in to the hair.There is also some temp gel type of color that wash out too. It really depends if her hair is porous from damage sometimes caused by the sun, chlorine, hair products {especially perms,permanent colors, etcThis site has some info:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wwbeautystore.com/hair-color-info.shtmlTracy.">http://www.wwbeautystore.com/hair-color-info.shtmlTracy.</a><br/>

Some people&#39;s hair is more porous than others. Mine should be extremely <br/>

she&#39;ll be ok. :)<br/>

 LOL yes do, I have some of my girls with the pink and blue hair too from <br/>
last year. &lt;g&gt;Are you going to put them at the groups or send as an <br/>
attachment. {I&#39;ll send em after I ask permission from them, and find out <br/>
where we send to.Tracy &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the rub.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a scanner. I can get them put on CD ROM but my drive is busted.<br/>
I just need a new computer.<br/>
I could mail real pictures if someone else could scan them? Is it really <br/>
worth all the fuss though?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351000545">Won&#39;t go All in to it for the sake of the list. LOLMost likely the color molecule is larger in the mascara so it doesn&#39;t get stuck as easy.If you shampoo and condition it with good products it can help &quot;heal&quot; your hair. Smooths down the cuticle of the hair. Hair cuticle is like a tree with bark. When it is damaged it sticks out like rough bark. Also what causes hair breakage. Tracy<br/>
