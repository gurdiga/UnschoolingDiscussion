 </span></blockquote>Cute!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have an interesting Father&#39;sDay situation.  Keith asked the kids to tell me <br/>
he wanted Babylon 5 on DVD.  A friend had recorded them all for him on VHS, <br/>
from a cable series of reruns, but I hear a few were glitched or cut off.<br/>
<br/>
Keith doesn&#39;t know how expensive that would be.<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, I ordered used copies of the first season and two specials (a <br/>
prequel and the series pilot).<br/>
<br/>
But Keith doesn&#39;t have a DVD player in our bedroom and he complains about the <br/>
den, about laundry and cats and the chairs being too low and ... (just <br/>
complains).<br/>
<br/>
So I priced DVD players but I hate to just charge it where he&#39;ll have to pay <br/>
for it.  And the last few checks I&#39;ve gotten for ThinkingSticks or a column or <br/>
tapes, I gave to Keith to deposit.<br/>
<br/>
AHA!! Kirby has a job!  He&#39;s working 30 hours next week!  So I asked him if <br/>
he could front me enough for a DVD player, and I&#39;ll pay him back most of it,  <br/>
plus try to talk Marty and Holly into putting some in.  Then I can pay Kirby <br/>
back gradually.  He said yes!   <br/>
<br/>
A different perspective. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It pays to have responsible kids doesn&#39;t it??!!! Glad you figured something<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So far we have a shirt from Old Navy that Tara got Joe. Tara and I picked up<br/>
a dvd of My Cousin Vinny. Looked for Shrek but K Mart didn&#39;t have it. Tara<br/>
found it at the mall but her friend told her it was too expensive, try Best<br/>
Buy or even Target. I want to get him a new belt. He wears one all the time<br/>
with his jeans and is need of a new one. Plus the Shrek dvd. I was looking<br/>
at some other things when I found out what he really wants. Tickets for<br/>
Aerosmith/Kiss concert!!! I am not a concert type of person now, unless<br/>
maybe CW but most definitely not rock like that!!! I have the number to call<br/>
as soon as I get him out of the house. Not sure what this will cost but I<br/>
know I will need to buy earplugs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it absolutely amazing how great our kids are? Kass and Kree were dying <br/>
to buy me a computer chair for Mother&#39;s Day. They kept hinting around for <br/>
weeks before about how bad my back must hurt sitting in the lawn chair I was <br/>
using. Then they went on to how embarrassing it must be when people come in my <br/>
bedroom and see a backyard chair at my computer. I knew where they were headed and <br/>
told them that my chair was just fine and computer chairs are pretty pricey <br/>
and just not a priority right now. The Sunday before Mother&#39;s Day, they looked <br/>
at all the ads in the newspaper for chairs. I could see they were a little <br/>
shocked at the expense of the chairs they wanted for me. Of course I pretended to <br/>
not notice that they were only looking at those ads. They started getting a <br/>
little down about it, then disappeared. I left the ads out for most of the day <br/>
and then threw them out. The next Saturday they went to the desert to quad <br/>
ride with my DH and his friends. I was in bad shape and welcomed the solitude to <br/>
stay in bed all day. When they arrived home that afternoon, I had just <br/>
showered and changed into new pajamas. They came in tired and filthy from riding in <br/>
some mud and said, &quot;We&#39;re hittin the showers mom, can you get dressed while we <br/>
get ready?&quot; Huh? I wanted to climb back in bed. Dh walked in and said,&quot;Did the <br/>
babies tell you to get dressed? They want you to go with us to pick out a <br/>
computer chair for your Mother&#39;s Day present.&quot; I argued the need and the expense <br/>
and he said, &quot;They came to me with the whole plan, you can&#39;t disappoint them.&quot; <br/>
He said they had put their money together and came up with $46. They told him <br/>
that they had enough for a chair, but not the kind they thought I deserved <br/>
and could he help? He was so excited that they were willing to part with every <br/>
cent they had for my gift that he said, &quot;Sure I&#39;ll put in too.&quot; Then they hit <br/>
him with the next question,&quot;Do we have to pay you back, since she&#39;s not your <br/>
mother?&quot; He said he couldn&#39;t help but crack up at their concern. He told <br/>
them,&quot;Nah, you don&#39;t have to pay me back since without me she wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>
mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got dressed and off we went to hunt out my perfect chair. We found it at <br/>
Lowes hardware store and it was on sale too!!! This brings me to a whole nother <br/>
thread about respect that children don&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
The chair came in this humongous box that was really heavy. The girls went <br/>
and retrieved one of those pallet type carts so their Daddy could put it on and <br/>
they could take it to the cashier. While walking thru the store my DH gave <br/>
them a hundred dollar bill to use with their money to pay for it. We walked past <br/>
them while they waited in line. Apparently there was some special that Lowes <br/>
card holders were getting that weekend and they were getting 10% off their <br/>
purchases. Problem was not one of the cashiers knew how to use this discount. We <br/>
waited as we watched all the cashiers clamor about trying to figure out how <br/>
discount their customers. Each one was on the phone or shouting back and forth to <br/>
another cashier. It was comedy. Kass and Kree just stood in line rolling <br/>
their eyes over the incompetence that was so obvious. Phil and I just laughed and <br/>
decided to go outside and look at the sidewalk stuff while the girls waited to <br/>
make their purchase. <br/>
<br/>
After another 10 minutes, I stopped listening to my chattering hubby and <br/>
watched the girls inside as they were in deep conversation with the check out <br/>
girl. He finally noticed I wasn&#39;t listening and asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I replied, <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but the girls look pissed.&quot; I started to walk back in when he <br/>
stopped me and said, &quot;They can handle themselves, Rhonda, just wait.&quot; He was <br/>
right. When they finally came outside with the pallet cart, they were pissed. <br/>
Phil asked, &quot;What took you so long?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were just disgusted and said,&quot;First daddy, did you see how poor their <br/>
customer service was? How can they not know how to calculate 10%?&quot; I laughed <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know they knew how to calculate 10%. They continued, &quot;Then after <br/>
one of them got a clue, they had the nerve to ask us if we were shopping <br/>
alone. Now how I ask you, do they think we got this big ass chair on this pallet? <br/>
We told that chick, &#39;no our parents are outside because they got tired of <br/>
waiting for you to figure out 10%. So can we have our receipt?&#39; Can you believe <br/>
them daddy?&quot; He said, &quot;Well yeah, they probably aren&#39;t used to kids shopping at <br/>
Lowes and paying for things alone.&quot; Then the clencher was, &quot;Well the last time <br/>
we checked kids with money are comsumer&#39;s too. And isn&#39;t there some law that <br/>
says a kid can be on their own if a judge says so?&quot; I was floored. I said, &quot;Do <br/>
you mean an emancipated minor?&quot; I could see that I hit the nail on the head <br/>
and they responded with, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it! I mean what if we were emancipated <br/>
minors, would they not sell us the chair? Then again mom they probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
know what that meant either since they couldn&#39;t figure out 10%, which by the <br/>
way we told her how to figure that out too. I bet she went to school too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have rambled on so much but I just had the need to share. It always <br/>
amazes me how much our kids get from just living and I wish our lost poster <br/>
was still here to see what my unschooling automatons are treating the world <br/>
like.<br/>

HUSBAND&#39;S day. :-)   If my kids have thier own money and want to buy me or thier <br/>
father something for mothers&#39;s/father&#39;s day, they do it.   If they don&#39;t have any <br/>
money because they haven&#39;t had a chance to earn/save any, then we will <br/>
definitely kick in to help them out.. OR suggest something like a special favor or <br/>
treat ( bake a cake, make card, do a chore, etc).   I think that Keith should <br/>
have told you to tell the kids what he wanted.  They should pay the biggest <br/>
portion of the gift.   <br/>

&lt;&lt;All of thats a lot of sense.. Especially since its FATHER&#39;S day, not<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I always but Father&#39;s Day gifts for my husband. Some from the kids and some<br/>
from me. Now that Tara is working, she will not allow me to guy gifts for<br/>
him. At Christmas, birthday and Father&#39;s Day, she spends her own money and<br/>
picks out her own gifts. I don&#39;t expect that and offer to give her money.<br/>
She won&#39;t hear of it.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has a very good friend. He&#39;s looking at a $500.00 portable small stereo<br/>
for his dad. He&#39;ll be paying with his credit card. His dad pays for the<br/>
credit card. The kid doesn&#39;t have a job. I think that&#39;s a little much. Pick<br/>
out a shirt or something!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  Interesting.  He has sun glasses, but I could send his ski goggles.<br/>
He&#39;s supposed to get email access eventually, maybe I&#39;ll wait and see if he<br/>
wants them.  I have no concept of how cities look in sandy countries; he is<br/>
truly IN Baghdad, but I don&#39;t know if that helps any or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the good idea.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll bet.  But they are telling us to not send food at all right now,<br/>
because it&#39;s 85 degrees here and 120 degress there, and in hot stuffy mail<br/>
rooms and airplanes between here and there, and things stitting around for<br/>
weeks before getting delivered, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re supposed to let them just be sick of MRE&#39;s until it&#39;s cooler and<br/>
the mail system works better.  (They keep telling everyone the mail system<br/>
will work better soon.  Right. &lt;dripping sarcasm&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
My wierdo husband actually likes MRE&#39;s.  Other wives are sending powdered<br/>
gaterade to mix with water.  My dh likes water better and insisted he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want gaterade.  I love him anyway, but I think he&#39;s kinda odd....<br/>

Great idea, especially the insoles!  I&#39;ll be the ones he has with him stink<br/>

I wasn&#39;t going to share this but since this topic has gone on for a few days <br/>
I&#39;ll pass this along for what it&#39;s worth.  Believe me, I did not make this up! <br/>
 There was an article in the newspaper a week or so ago about this very <br/>
subject -- what do military personnel stationed in the Mideast want sent from home. <br/>
 Definitely the baby wipes!  They&#39;re highly treasured!  Things to freshen the <br/>
mouth.  And -- heavens, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m even posting this -- feminine <br/>
hygiene panty liners!  Honest to goodness, I&#39;m not making this up!  The soldiers <br/>
adhere them to the inside of their helmets in the forehead area to absorb the <br/>
sweat so they&#39;re not constantly having all that dirt and sweat up against <br/>
their foreheads.  Certainly makes sense to me!  However, if your husband has a <br/>
desk job, he may not have such a huge need for panty liners for his helmet.  ;-)  <br/>
OK, I&#39;m going away now.<br/>

That reminds me of a story a mailman told me years ago. He delivered to one<br/>
very large retirement condo. One time he had free samples of maxi pads<br/>
delivered to all residents there. He found out one lady was asking for those<br/>
that no one wanted, she was collecting them. He was wondering what for when<br/>
one day he saw her cleaning her windows. She said they did a wonderful job!!<br/>

  &gt; I think that Keith should <br/>
  &gt; have told you to tell the kids what he wanted.  They should pay the biggest <br/>
  &gt; portion of the gift.   <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Keith kind of asked for a $400 gift, though, and he knows it&#39;s his money.  He <br/>
  just doesn&#39;t like to spend it himself. &lt;g&gt;  And we&#39;ll all end up benefiting.<br/>

My husband is out and about, so no desk job.  Maybe I&#39;ll buy a package and<br/>
stick them in with a note.  Even if he doesn&#39;t want them, he has a female<br/>
assistant who would eventually get some use out of a box of them, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

And it could be worth a GREAT laugh!  Thanks!<br/>

  Isn&#39;t it absolutely amazing how great our kids are? Kass and Kree were dying <br/>
  to buy me a computer chair for Mother&#39;s Day. They kept hinting around for <br/>
  weeks before about how bad my back must hurt sitting in the lawn chair I was <br/>
  using. Then they went on to how embarrassing it must be when people come in my <br/>
  bedroom and see a backyard chair at my computer. I knew where they were headed and <br/>
  told them that my chair was just fine and computer chairs are pretty pricey <br/>
  and just not a priority right now. The Sunday before Mother&#39;s Day, they looked <br/>
  at all the ads in the newspaper for chairs. I could see they were a little <br/>
  shocked at the expense of the chairs they wanted for me. Of course I pretended to <br/>
  not notice that they were only looking at those ads. They started getting a <br/>
  little down about it, then disappeared. I left the ads out for most of the day <br/>
  and then threw them out. The next Saturday they went to the desert to quad <br/>
  ride with my DH and his friends. I was in bad shape and welcomed the solitude to <br/>
  stay in bed all day. When they arrived home that afternoon, I had just <br/>
  showered and changed into new pajamas. They came in tired and filthy from riding in <br/>
  some mud and said, &quot;We&#39;re hittin the showers mom, can you get dressed while we <br/>
  get ready?&quot; Huh? I wanted to climb back in bed. Dh walked in and said,&quot;Did the <br/>
  babies tell you to get dressed? They want you to go with us to pick out a <br/>
  computer chair for your Mother&#39;s Day present.&quot; I argued the need and the expense <br/>
  and he said, &quot;They came to me with the whole plan, you can&#39;t disappoint them.&quot; <br/>
  He said they had put their money together and came up with $46. They told him <br/>
  that they had enough for a chair, but not the kind they thought I deserved <br/>
  and could he help? He was so excited that they were willing to part with every <br/>
  cent they had for my gift that he said, &quot;Sure I&#39;ll put in too.&quot; Then they hit <br/>
  him with the next question,&quot;Do we have to pay you back, since she&#39;s not your <br/>
  mother?&quot; He said he couldn&#39;t help but crack up at their concern. He told <br/>
  them,&quot;Nah, you don&#39;t have to pay me back since without me she wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>
  mother.&quot;<br/>
