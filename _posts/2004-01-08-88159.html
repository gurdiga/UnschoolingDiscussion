&lt;&lt; My 13-this-month daughter STILL loves Arthur. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s twelve and she and her 14 year old homeschooled friend talk about <br/>
Arthur a lot.  They analyze characters and situations.   <br/>
<br/>
Monday afternoon she got all involved with an old Super Nintendo game on <br/>
which you can compose music (a Mario something), and she played with so much <br/>
concentration that she looked up after a while and said &quot;Oh no!! I missed Arthur!&quot;  <br/>
She had missed Arthur by almost an hour, but had been so engrossed in making <br/>
songs that she had forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too school-based for my tastes, and I don&#39;t like the way the kids treat <br/>
each other sometimes, but Holly who has a pretty peaceful life seems to have a <br/>
vicarious need to observe families (real or not) where people don&#39;t get along <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
I like the characterization of Arthur&#39;s dad a lot.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly likes his dog, who sang &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; about bacon (because she knows <br/>
the song through her Depression and Fred Astaire interests).<br/>
