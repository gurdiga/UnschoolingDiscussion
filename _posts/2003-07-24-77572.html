student---not by a Lo-o-o-o-o-o-ong shot. My best friend&#39;s and my final exam <br/>
scores couldn&#39;t be added together to get a passing grade in Chemistry 2! Open book <br/>
exam! I made an 11; Sarah got a 23! John got 127! (Extra credit!)<br/>
<br/>
And when Mrs Magoffin got up to present the award, I was ribbing John about <br/>
SURELY winning THIS one!  Well, she started out, &quot; The winner of this year&#39;s <br/>
science award doesn&#39;t go to the best student, the student with the highest <br/>
grades, or the student with the best presentation. It goes to the student with the <br/>
most enthusiasm, with most desire, and the biggest LOVE of science. It goes to <br/>
the student who tried her hardest. It goes to...Kelly Dunlap. SHIT! I <br/>
accepted it red-faced! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to be SOOO good at chemistry. I failed miserably. But it looked good <br/>
on the transcript! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
