<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800570259">On TV, some cook on Good Morning America, talking about food to serve during the Super Bowl, and she says &quot;I don&#39;t serve dessert until the fourth quarter, because you have to wait for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s making all kinds of meat, vegetable, cheese things. Bean dip, beer prezels with dip.   She&#39;s already telling the other people who are there tasting her samples that they&#39;re eating too much.    And no dessert unless they&#39;ve eaten other things for 3/4 of a football game.<br/>
<br/>
Too many rules and to too much pressure.  Maybe too much food, too, unless she was having 20 people over.  But &quot;too much food&quot; is part of a feast or a party.  If someone makes more food than can be eaten, for a once-a-year party situation, that is NOT the day to be shaming them and limiting them and telling them what order they &quot;have to&quot; eat the food.<br/>
<br/>
All these years of discussing unschooling have really sensitized me to the nonsense of what people claim others &quot;have to&quot; do or &quot;have to&quot; wait for.  <br/>

Sorry I&#39;m a little late in posting my reply - but I wanted to share that we went shopping for Super Bowl snacks the day before the game.  None in our family are too into football, but my 8 year old son thinks it&#39;s fun to watch the commercials (I agree!)  and this year he was even rooting for a team too, &quot;because they have yellow pants, Mom  YELLOW pants  that&#39;s just SO awesome!!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so we went shopping for snacks, and my son picked out a big bag of honey barbecue potato chips  a flavor that&#39;s a new favorite of his.  We brought them home and placed the bag on the counter, along with the tortilla chips, beans, avocados, etc. that we bought to make bean dip for whoever wanted some of that to snack on during the game/commercials too.  <br/>
<br/>
Part way through dinner that night, my son looked over at the counter, looked over at me, and said, &quot;Mom, you only live once, right?  And if you only live once, shouldn&#39;t you have honey barbecue chips with your dinner the day BEFORE the Super Bowl, if you want them the day before the Super Bowl, even if they are called Super Bowl snacks?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you should.</div>
