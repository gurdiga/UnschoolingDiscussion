<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904143468">I am getting a lot out of your responses - thank you!  I have become <br/>
aware of conversations I need to have with my kids and of options <br/>
open to us all, as a family.<br/>
<br/>
I am seeking an unschooling perspective because this is the kind of <br/>
atmosphere / lifestyle I would like to create in our home.  <br/>
Specifically for us, an atmosphere where our children feel their <br/>
opinions are valued, they are trusted, and they really love <br/>
learning.  (I do not always succeed & so these lists/reading/etc. are <br/>
helping me to continue moving in a positive direction.)  (...for our <br/>
family!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much personal info. we are supposed to share (or <br/>
not) on the list, but we have been foster parents for 5 1/2 years.  <br/>
Our three amazing kids were adopted at various stages during this <br/>
51/2 year adventure, and all experienced multiple forms of abuse.  <br/>
One event the other night summed it all up for me; my daughter was <br/>
laying in my bed talking to me about her day.  She suddenly burst <br/>
into tears and said, &quot;I can&#39;t be myself or I won&#39;t be wanted&quot;.  We <br/>
cried together and talked about all the things we have talked about <br/>
so many times over the years - how precious and unique she is, how <br/>
none of the things that happened to her were her fault, how <br/>
incredibly she is loved and cherished by us.  (Her comment was in <br/>
regards to an incident at a group activity earlier in the day.)<br/>
<br/>
It is so important to me that my actions communicate acceptance to my <br/>
children.  Unfortunately, no matter what I say, too many people in <br/>
her short life so far have sent her the message, &quot;you are not wanted <br/>
here, welcome here, good enough&quot;.  This is her current interpretation <br/>
of the actions of most of the important adults in her life so far <br/>
(natural parents, aunts & grandparents who were relative-foster <br/>
caregivers, teachers, caseworkers, and even us - she was our first, <br/>
and we made BIG mistakes in our first year of parenting, in the form <br/>
of consequences and reward systems.)<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, I guess when it comes to taking classes where they might be <br/>
told their drawing isn&#39;t &quot;good enough&quot;, and told this 5-7 times, I <br/>
have mixed feelings about letting my child participate.  I feel like <br/>
I am sending a message of &quot;I don&#39;t trust you, you can&#39;t choose for <br/>
yourself&quot; if I don&#39;t let Gino sign up for the class, and I feel like <br/>
I am allowing more messages like, &quot;your best isn&#39;t good enough&quot; to be <br/>
heaped on his consciousness if I do let him participate.<br/>
<br/>
I am becoming more well-informed thanks to the discussions on this <br/>
list - thank you again for taking the time to share your opinions / <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
As my grandfather passed away last night, I won&#39;t be able to check in <br/>
for about a week.  We&#39;re heading from Chicago down to Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Take care all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
