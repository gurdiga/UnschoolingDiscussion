<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743283426">Dear Unschooling list group,<br/>
<br/>
I have been deleting alot of mail lately, as I am in no mood to take the time<br/>
to sign onto my computer and find people bashing people. Please take<br/>
your cutting down of others privately and off this list. <br/>
If I wanted to read junk, I would send my son back to PS, and attend IEP <br/>
meetings<br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
GROW UP! <br/>
I use this list for information and direction, not to open a piece of mail and<br/>
be a included on this yucky party line.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Cosmos loves to deposit mail like this in my mailbox JUST when ALL the<br/>
other unschooling.com mail coming in has been real-and-interesting<br/>
unschooling topics and answers to same and no bickering or rudeness.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being a grownup means learning that everything is not about you.<br/>
(And that if you do read instead of deleting you&#39;ll know when the discussion<br/>
has moved on, rather than suddenly leaping into a room of calm, productive<br/>
people and yelling at them).<br/>
<br/>
Yours for calm productiveness,<br/>
<br/>
