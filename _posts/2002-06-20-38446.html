<br/>
If I consciously thought &quot;AHA!  Kirby&#39;s socks have not been in any of these <br/>
five loads of laundry!&quot; then it would be malice and entrapment on my part.  <br/>
But I do most of the laundry, and I do it as it piles up on the floor by the <br/>
washer.  There&#39;s a laundry chute from upstairs.  The kids bring laundry when <br/>
they want to, it gets washed, dried, put on the couch downstairs, and maybe <br/>
folded and re-delivered.  If through all of that ongoing repeating monotonous <br/>
process one kid has gone a week without putting anything in the laundry room, <br/>
I&#39;m not tracking that.  <br/>
<br/>
When they were little it was my job to put their dirty clothes in the right <br/>
place, because I was the one who helped them change clothes.  At 15 and 13 I <br/>
don&#39;t make them do all their own laundry (sometimes they help, sometimes they <br/>
do some), but neither do I remind them regularly, nor do I &quot;punish&quot; them.  <br/>
But if their socks are all gone, it&#39;s because their socks are still in their <br/>
room and were not by the washing machine.  <br/>
<br/>
I see no reason to withhold privileges from them in addition to being the <br/>
washerwoman.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557512743">This is how I handle laundry in our home.<br/>
I just do it.<br/>
I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a big deal or a burden.<br/>
I have a laundry basket in my room.<br/>
Our house is fairly small and rooms close together.<br/>
Usually every day at some point, my kids throw their dirty clothes into the<br/>
laundry basket in my room.<br/>
Every 3 days or so I do laundry.<br/>
I sort darks, lights, and whites.<br/>
I go into the kids rooms to get any dirty clothes that haven&#39;t been put in<br/>
my room yet, making sure to pick up stray socks even in various places of<br/>
the house sometimes.<br/>
I hang the clothes to dry on a clothesline and bring them in and fold them.<br/>
Sometimes my dh helps me do this part.<br/>
I put the clothes away or sometimes leave it for my kids to do. (my boys are<br/>
9 & 11)<br/>
I remember my mom always did laundry for us this way, sometimes I helped,<br/>
sometimes I didn&#39;t.<br/>
Maybe at some point I&#39;ll suggest that my boys start doing some of their own<br/>
laundry, but there may be a problem with that. They have so few clothes that<br/>
before they could justify doing a full load of laundry, they&#39;d probably have<br/>
run out of clothes to wear a long time ago! Especially a load of whites and<br/>
even pants/shorts.<br/>
I don&#39;t know - I just see doing laundry as one of my &quot;mom&quot; jobs.<br/>
Hope I&#39;m not &quot;spoiling&quot; my boys, maybe I&#39;ll feel differently as they get<br/>
older, but for now *I* make sure they have clean clothes to wear.<br/>
