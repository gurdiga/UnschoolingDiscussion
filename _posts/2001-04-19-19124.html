&gt; Well, not entirely.  I&#39;m sure you raised her in a way that maximized her<br/>
&gt; potential, but she is also a GIRL, and whether it is sexist to admit <br/>
&gt; this or not,<br/>
&gt; girls do mature much more quickly than boys.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>no, not necessarily<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   I am speaking of both mental and<br/>
&gt; verbal maturity.  Trust me, I have a biology degree and I do know some<br/>
&gt; things. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure you know many things, but this is one area I cannot trust you <br/>
and will not trust you.  Others on this list have equally impressive <br/>
degrees and areas of knowledge, but for the most part I don&#39;t believe a <br/>
college education means very much.  For example some of the best <br/>
teachers I know have little or no formal education while some of the <br/>
worst teachers have spent years aquiring this certification or that <br/>
degree in education.  I think very few unschoolers would be impressed <br/>
with college degrees, but especially those of us who also have college <br/>
degrees and understand that they rarely mean gathering of life long <br/>
learning and instead measure an ability to play a game.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Boys are relatively &quot;retarded&quot; in these areas, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel sad for your boys, that you feel so.  I don&#39;t have a boy but I <br/>
would love one, and I can tell you I don&#39;t think I would ever refer to <br/>
any part of my boy as retarded.  I know many boys, having taught for <br/>
years and years, having three nephews, and being alive and observant in <br/>
various situations, and while I do accept that there are some biological <br/>
differences between boys and girls, I personally think that nurture is <br/>
so much more important.  I think it&#39;s sad that your boys have a mom who <br/>
consider them &quot;retarded&quot; in any area, and it makes me think that often <br/>
children perform to expectations--I did learn that in college but it is <br/>
something that I have seen play out in real life in the classroom and in <br/>
my own home, so I think there is something to it.  If a parent expects a <br/>
child to be socially retarded, they should not be surprised when that <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, children learn by what they see, based on your words I <br/>
wonder what kind of modeling you are doing for your own children and <br/>
would most definately put a greater emphases on their behavior on that <br/>
modeling and on your feelings about boys instead of on the fact they <br/>
have a penis.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and yet they tend to be if<br/>
&gt; anything MORE active at a younger age, so the potential for getting <br/>
&gt; themselves<br/>
&gt; into danger should be obvious. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a good friend who almost cried when she realized she was h aving <br/>
a little boy.  She wanted a sweet gentle easy little girl, and was <br/>
worried about how she&#39;d be able to handle a little boy who would fall <br/>
out of trees or off walls or who would get into scuffles with friends. <br/>
 We met when our children were about 4 months of age, they are about 1 <br/>
month apart in age.  It was immediately clear that she had a sweet easy <br/>
little boy and I had a high need little girl who was anything but sweet <br/>
and easy.  Her little boy has never broken anything, never needed <br/>
stiches or a cast, seldom scrapes his knees.  His quite mature and easy <br/>
going, he could play with small toys very early, as he never put <br/>
anything in his mouth and was quite mature with both language and fine <br/>
motor skills.  Lexie on the other hand has fine motor issues because of <br/>
her vision issues and she&#39;s a rough and tumble little girl who loves to <br/>
climb trees and walk on walls and roll in the grass.  My girls love all <br/>
animals and insticts, and have few fears.  I have raised them as sexfree <br/>
as possible, buying them &quot;boy&quot; toys and &quot;girl&quot; toys and not labeling <br/>
those items in any way.  They would push around their trucks in their <br/>
strollers and breastfeed their dinosaurs.  Oh, and to answer another <br/>
post, there were using knifes when they were toddlers as well, with <br/>
assistance and help, because I personally do not believe that saying <br/>
&quot;NO!&quot; to those dangerous items works, but instead helping a child learn <br/>
about things that can be potentially dangerous so that they can manage <br/>
them and know how to deal with various situations helps better.  Janene <br/>
has been lighting matches since she was three, as she was facinated with <br/>
the candles and it seemed wiser to give her some control over fire and <br/>
matches as well as some guidelines regarding those items instead of <br/>
simply saying no.  She has burned herself, she knows the power of <br/>
matches, and this knowledge has made her powerful, so there is no need <br/>
for her to &quot;Play&quot; with matches.  It is interesting but my friend just <br/>
had another little boy and she was thrilled now to have a brother for <br/>
her son.  Her 2nd sone is more like Lexie, definately a strong willed <br/>
child who is going to have my friend rethink all of her ideas about <br/>
little boys and little girls.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And no, it isn&#39;t possible to just talk them<br/>
&gt; out of it. I don&#39;t think anyone who has only raised girls fully <br/>
&gt; understands just<br/>
&gt; how much trouble little boys can get themselves into, things that <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even occur to the average mom until they happen, because as a general <br/>
&gt; rule we<br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t think the way they do! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a statement of ignorence.  How can you make a statement?  Amazing. <br/>
 Again, that theory of expectations I think is in play here. But to be <br/>
honest, I&#39;m not even sure what to say here.  I&#39;m pretty confident that <br/>
you don&#39;t even read what any of us write, at least not with an open <br/>
mind.  So what is the point of me responding to this horrible sexist <br/>
statement.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I will say this--why must we call it trouble!  My girls have <br/>
certainly gotten themselves into lots of situations, things that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have occured to me that they might do until afterwards, but I <br/>
certainly rarely called it &quot;Trouble&quot; because for me and to me it was a <br/>
learning experience.  Trouble is so negative.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I was reading to my boys even before they were born, I avoid talking <br/>
&gt; down to<br/>
&gt; them and I&#39;ve always explained things to them as if they were capable of<br/>
&gt; understanding complex ideas.  And they are, but they have still done <br/>
&gt; some really<br/>
&gt; stupid, dangerous things, as has their dad, come to think of it, even <br/>
&gt; though as<br/>
&gt; an undergraduate he aced such complex things as Physical Chemistry and<br/>
&gt; Differential Equations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t come to any conclusion other than to just say it must be a guy <br/>
&gt; thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or maybe it&#39;s an expectation thing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s sad that your boys have a mom who<br/>
&gt; &gt; consider them &quot;retarded&quot; in any area,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Retarded&quot; in this context is not an insult.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally I think there are simply some terms that are insulting or <br/>
whose accepted meaning are such that it should not be used in polite <br/>
company.  Retarded is one of those words.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In reading the above, I saw that the word was offensive, and that <br/>
basically it means to slow or for development to be slower than normal.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   And it&#39;s perfectly normal.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, even if we go along with the premise that the majority of boys are <br/>
slower to develop in certain areas than girls, and that this is normal, <br/>
the word &quot;retarded&quot; doesn&#39;t fit because it is simply, as you said, <br/>
normal.  It is not retarded.  I&#39;ve worked with &quot;retarded&quot; or mentally <br/>
slow children--they are far from normal.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I find the word offensive and personally I don&#39;t use words to <br/>
describe my children that are offensive.  For instance, I don&#39;t call my <br/>
five year old hyper, instead I say she is full of energy.  I don&#39;t say <br/>
she doesn&#39;t listen and is stubborn, instead I say she has her own mind. <br/>
 I have done this since before I had kids, when I was teaching special <br/>
education and I called the little retards in my classroom &quot;children that <br/>
learn at their own pace.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This doesn&#39;t mean every single<br/>
&gt; case, to be sure.  I know little girls who didn&#39;t read before they <br/>
&gt; were 11, and<br/>
&gt; little boys who taught themselves to read at 4.  But in general, most <br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt; girls are ready to read earlier than most little boys.  The male <br/>
&gt; brain, more<br/>
&gt; than the female brain, tends to be wired to act without thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>how insulting can you be?  It is clear that you don&#39;t think much of men, <br/>
and I see that as being very sad.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Neither.  I think &quot;stupid&quot;.***<br/>
 <br/>
***my word was idiot.***<br/>
<br/>
My brother said &quot;stupid idiot&quot; about me falling out of a tree last<br/>
month.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I climb stuff.   I&#39;m not a professional or experienced climber but I&#39;ve<br/>
climbed some rocks here and there and done some climbing in caves.   <br/>
<br/>
It is fun.  If I thought I could get to the top of the First Christian<br/>
Church down on fourth street I&#39;d try it.   I mean if I thought I could<br/>
get there without getting arrested.  I know I could get to the top.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I got pretty far up that last tree before I fell.  Perspective is<br/>
different from the top of a tree, or the top of a cliff or the high wall<br/>
of a room in a cave.   My changing perspective over the years has changed<br/>
my person, too.  I don&#39;t mind falling down once in a while because the<br/>
perspective is different from down there, too. <br/>
<br/>
I fell off the trampoline but that&#39;s because my forty year old body and<br/>
motion sick mind couldn&#39;t keep up with the flippy trapeze thing I was<br/>
trying to reproduce on Missouri avenue, Deer Lodge, Montana. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan, eleven year old boy, has not fallen out of or off of anything<br/>
since last September, so his boy record is better than his stupid idiot<br/>
mother&#39;s record. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
We all seem to be just fine. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, who&#39;s husband wants Mexican food tonight but just said he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want me to slave over a hot griddle (it&#39;s 92 degrees here) OR, maybe he<br/>
said he didn&#39;t want me to squeeze into a hot girdle.   The fan is noisy<br/>
and I can&#39;t hear anything...<br/>
Either way, he&#39;s making dinner. Woo Hoo!</div>
