&lt;&lt; Okay so is creationism believing in the bible? I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s even <br/>
 the right word, is it? Religion isn&#39;t my forte. So those who believe the <br/>
 bible as what is absolute, do they believe in dinosaurs and<br/>
 prehistoric man? If so, how does that fit in with the bible. If not, do they <br/>
 just not believe fossils? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, too many creationists try to get the evidence to support the <br/>
Bible. That sorta taints it.<br/>
But then I see a lot of evolutionist views ignoring evidence that flies in <br/>
the face of their views.<br/>
Sigh....I think their are grains of truth in a lot of stuff. Like for me, the <br/>
evidence points too strongly towards an older earth than what the <br/>
creationists want to believe. AND they want the Bible to be literal, period. <br/>
No chance for stuff left out, or altered, or mythical.<br/>
So that&#39;s where the problem is for me.<br/>
Even though I believe in a God that sparked creation.<br/>

Without the Bible (and the hope to prove it all literal) there IS no <br/>
creationism though.  To try to prove it WITHOUT the Bible is a weird <br/>
contortionism.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s pretend the premise never existed and prove the theory.  Then we will <br/>
hold the original premise up to our evidence, and it will look true!&quot;   But <br/>
the &quot;evidence&quot; is trying with all its might to point toward the premise, <br/>
which is that Genesis is literal in every word.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756516295">I&#39;m not a creationist, but neither do I feel the need to prove G-d exists, or the Torah (Jewish version of the Bible, much more than the Old Testement...a term not used really among Jews) is valid.  It is a belief, and as such, not subject to the same rigorous testing that is required for scientific theories.  As I hold and believe that a person can be quite good and moral without G-d, I don&#39;t see the need in making anyone else believe in G-d.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather have people stop hurting each other...<br/>

be well,<br/>

What people have the answers? This I&#39;d like to know. Unless you were there, <br/>

I personally don&#39;t believe anyone can have the answers to all the questions <br/>
that have been brought up here. That&#39;s why I made the point of saying <br/>
&quot;people who believe&quot; and have the answers. I just wanted a point of view <br/>
from someone who has faith in the bible and believes it and also can provide <br/>
me with some &#39;well what abouts.&#39; I just never got a lot of questions <br/>
answered about religion and faith growing up. I also encountered the same <br/>
thing so far with one of my children. Thought I could be prepared if it <br/>
comes up again. Plus I&#39;m still curious myself.<br/>
