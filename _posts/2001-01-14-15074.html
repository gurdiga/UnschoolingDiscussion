<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543064600">Sorry to be changing subject lines all the time, but I&#39;m reading the digest <br/>
version and it&#39;s better than &quot;digest #7,450&quot;  or whatever they&#39;re called &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   But how can you tell when a child wants<br/>
 to do something in more depth, such as take a class or get more training<br/>
 in it.  Will they always tell you? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can see in their eyes when something is really exciting, or see the <br/>
excited agitation in their posture and voice if they&#39;re at the museum or in <br/>
the library or online and they see something that really lights them up.  Or <br/>
the&#39;ll ask questions, like about the space station or whatever.    If you see <br/>
a class offered, you could mention it.  Maybe you could offer to take the <br/>
class with your child.  Or rent a video about that subject next time you&#39;re <br/>
at the video store. If you make the suspected interest accessible, you can <br/>
watch and see whether they&#39;re still interested.<br/>
<br/>
I was helping raise a child long ago, my first husband&#39;s 10-13 year old <br/>
brother.  He had a huge fascination with all flight--planes, helicopters, <br/>
spacecraft.  We used to get him books, and take him places.  Then after a <br/>
while he was done, and went on to other things.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be a huge Beatles fan, and I still know some trivia others find <br/>
useful, and I have my albums and listen to them sometimes (I was on a binge a <br/>
couple of weeks ago--Something New, Beatles 65, Yesterday and Today...).  But <br/>
now if a book comes out or a TV special or a new Beatles recording, I don&#39;t <br/>
really care.  I&#39;ve moved on to other things.  It&#39;s important to let our kids <br/>
do that too.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither &quot;shower them with it and send them to special summer camps&quot; nor &quot;just <br/>
ignore them and if they want it they&#39;ll beg&quot; is the right answer.  The right <br/>
answers are always toward the balance point, in my experience.  Be prepared <br/>
to help without being oppressive with help.<br/>
