&lt;&lt;I&#39;m with Juli, that giving money for every day chores<br/>
is the wrong message.  My feeling is that these things<br/>
need to be learned as a basic life skills kind of<br/>
thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also definately in agreement here.  My dd has money for what she <br/>
needs/wants because she&#39;s part of the family and not old enough to make it on <br/>
her own, and she helps because it&#39;s the right thing to do.  She&#39;s only 5 now, <br/>
but I will continue with this always, I hope.  If there&#39;s something <br/>
special/extra/out of the ordinary she does, I will pay her for this, just as <br/>
we would get paid.  But this hasn&#39;t happened yet.   I feel this sets them up <br/>
for more realistic money habits in the future. I just love this whole concept!<br/>

Does anybody know of a book that advocates this type of arrangement with kids?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
