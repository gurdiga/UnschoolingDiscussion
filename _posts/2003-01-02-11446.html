&lt;&lt; We lived in Augusta, Georgia <br/>
from 90 to 93.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was born there!  But I never lived there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We have found memory of the South, including our third <br/>
son (family humour). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I was a conceived-in-Texas baby, but I&#39;m not sure.  Maybe conceived <br/>
in Aiken, South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was conceived on a water bed at a friend&#39;s house in Boulder, Colorado.<br/>
Marty and Holly were conceived at our house, in a bed Holly now has in her <br/>
room.  <br/>
<br/>
I had Kirby because I broke my leg.  Indirectly, but definitely related.<br/>
So this time when I broke my leg I got a couple of moments of razzing from <br/>
people who have known me 20 years, about not getting pregnant again.<br/>

I say &quot;it&#39;s not age, it&#39;s technology&quot;.  20 years ago you didn&#39;t have the<br/>
internet (and us!) to entertain you in your enforced idleness, so of<br/>
course you had to dabble in low tech amusement.  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the reason! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

AHA!!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why my husband complains that his sex life is down.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s that, or maybe it&#39;s that he&#39;s 25 years OLDER than when I first <br/>
helped him create unreasonable expectations for the remainder of his days.<br/>
<br/>
I quit using birth control pills so that I wouldn&#39;t have so much blood clot <br/>
potential in a toe-to-hip cast.  But after a few months, I got a cast just up <br/>
to the knee.  And suddenly other things became possible!<br/>
