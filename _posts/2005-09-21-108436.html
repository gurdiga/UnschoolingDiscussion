<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927881237">Who are able to put up a family of unschooling Rita evacuees from <br/>
Houston?  We are trying to figure out where to go but money is really <br/>
tight.  All the credit cards went to plywood etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are 6 of us- me, dh, 17, 15, 11 yod and 20 yos.  We also have <br/>
animals but will be bringing cages and crates.  We&#39;re lots of fun and <br/>
can train your dogs, show your kids how to do karate, juggle, <br/>
entertain you with comdey, dancing, singing or we can babysit, weed <br/>
your garden, paint your house or do your dishes in exchange. :-)  We <br/>
will have our own food and one tent.<br/>

I tried to call but got a recording about curcuits being busy.  We would like to come to your house if we need to.  We&#39;re still waiting to decide until we hear the evening news.  My daughter said they are downgrading her and she&#39;ll probably be a catagory 3.  It was so much easier without kids.  I would easily take the risk.<br/>

This is the best source for information about it according to my dh - better<br/>
(more comprehensive for the public) than the advisory at the NWS. These<br/>
folks are some meteorologists who analyze all the data, load it into their<br/>
own supercomputers, and then put out their opinion in a measured, not<br/>
sensationalized, manner. Plus it is very much up to the minute. (Downgrading<br/>
to a category 3 does not sound likely at the last input.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773488544">Oh boy!  That&#39;s frightening.  The Perfect Storm.  <br/>
 <br/>
Hurricanes have always been my favirute natural disaster. I used to love watching films of them in science class or on documentaries.  This will be my thrid one but the other two were merely a Cat. 3 and 2.  There was lots of excitement and very little danger where I was staying.  When Alicia hit, the eye passed right over.  What an experience!  The energy is just incredible and you realize that man really has no control over what the earth does.  It&#39;s very humbling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003904370">Also, I&#39;ve been listening to _www.wwl.com_ (http://www.wwl.com)   (am station <br/>
in New Orleans) online.  They&#39;re on all the time taking calls  and getting <br/>
information out.  I am sure there are Texas stations that are  in full emergency <br/>
mode already.  I find this to be more informative and  satisfying than CNN or <br/>
blogs.<br/>
 <br/>
After I read my mail I am going to hunt up a Houston or Galveston station  <br/>
and see what I can hear.  I&#39;ll post one if I find one.<br/>

They should probably just go up to UTMB. Otherwise they will now be caught<br/>
in the same traffic snarl that you mentioned, Holly.<br/>
<br/>
My father is in charge of evacuating patients and managing the services for<br/>
non-evacuees (if moving would kill them) and on going emergency running of<br/>
the hospital at UTMB - one of the safest, most high-tech complex of<br/>
buildings in the region. It was designed and built to withstand a Cat 5, as<br/>
is the only other skyscraper on the island, a bank.<br/>
<br/>
All the relevant staff were ordered to the hospital on Wednesday, and to be<br/>
ready to stay there for a week. So he has put up the shutters at his home<br/>
and gone in.<br/>
