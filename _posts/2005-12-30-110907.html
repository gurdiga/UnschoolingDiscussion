<div id="ygrps-yiv-884271355">This thread reminds me that I wanted to ask for input about strewing in a <br/>
small crowded house.  I have in my mind the idea of the empty table on <br/>
which things semi magically appear that are either relevant or new and <br/>
different.  But the reality is that the dining room table is our office and <br/>
strewn with mail.  I try to clear it off if it&#39;s not stuff someone&#39;s <br/>
working on, but it&#39;s rarely near empty.  I hate to spend so much time <br/>
straightening up too.  (housework, if done right, can kill you...)<br/>
<br/>
SO what are alternative ways people have of providing space for new playthings?<br/>
