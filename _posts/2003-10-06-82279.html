NCUnschoolers group!   :-)   We&#39;ve amassed over 50 member in two weeks!   Our <br/>
NCUnschoolers group is designed to help unschoolers in NC (and surrouding states, if its <br/>
feasible for them) get to know each other and hopefully meet on occasion.  We <br/>
are planning a trip to Raliegh this month!  There seems to be a big population <br/>
of unschoolers in the Triad area.  Here&#39;s the link to the group. <br/>
