I  thought that I clearly articulated why I am talking about it. It&#39;s going <br/>
on in  my family right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not with an unschooler.<br/>
Not with a child whose parents did all the  things people on this list do and <br/>
recommend doing and explain at length  repeatedly about how and why.<br/>

We can try to reassure you (have) and you can continue to cling to wild  <br/>
fears.<br/>
It would be better if you tried to live in this moment rather than in  <br/>
reaction to a fantasy of a possible ten-years-hence.  If you live in the  <br/>
ten-years-maybe-horrible future, you WILL do worse in this moment than you could  and <br/>
should do if you were in this very second in communion with your  daughter.  <br/>
BEING with her.  Being with her where she is emotionally  and intellectually.  <br/>
Being with her where she is in wonderment and  enjoyment.  She might not even be <br/>
alive in ten years.  It&#39;s  spring.  There are newnesses of all sorts to her <br/>
right now outside in your  yard or neighborhood.  Bugs and flowers and buds and <br/>
blossoms you might  have seen every year for 30 years, 40 years, but she <br/>
might not ever have seen,  or might not remember from last year.  It&#39;s not heroin. <br/>
 It&#39;s not  marijuana.  It&#39;s not illicit sex.  It&#39;s today, April, 2005,  <br/>
morning.<br/>
 <br/>
This reminds me of something that would help you be at peace and in  hope:<br/>

one of my own pages so I can fix that):<br/>

Unschooling - Sandra Dodd<br/>
Morning  <br/>
At your house it will be morning again within 24 hours, but it  could be <br/>
morning in your heart any second.  <br/>
Somewhere in the world it is morning every moment. Somewhere,  light is <br/>
dawning. Some people, and I&#39;m one of them, believe that any portal to  the universe <br/>
leads to the whole universe, and if that&#39;s true we should be able  to get to <br/>
everything in the whole wide world (and beyond) without much effort  from <br/>
something as small as, say, the definition of a word. How about &quot;morning&quot;  and its <br/>
particulars--daybreak, dawn and sunrise?  <br/>
Every day the sun comes up (unless you&#39;re in the Arctic or  Antarctic, in <br/>
which cases your sun-mileage may vary). Every day is a new  opportunity. People <br/>
say that all the time: &quot;It&#39;s the dawning of a new day.&quot; If  you just let those <br/>
thoughts and truths go by, you&#39;re missing something important  that happens <br/>
365 days a year (sometimes with a bonus round). Don&#39;t miss  important things <br/>
like opportunities for renewal and change. At your house it  will be morning <br/>
again within 24 hours, but it could be morning in your heart any  second.  <br/>
&quot;The morning of the world,&quot; someone might say, meaning just as  the world was <br/>
new and bright. From this we and our children can talk about and  learn about <br/>
poetry and figurative speech. &quot;The morning of his life...&quot; when  likening a <br/>
lifetime to a day, with its own first light, eventual afternoon, and  twilight. <br/>
These are common references. &quot;In Queen Victoria&#39;s day...&quot;  <br/>
At our wedding my friends and relatives all sang &quot;Morning Has  Broken,&quot; and <br/>
it was the morning of our lives together. Later that day we had  three <br/>
children. Well, later meaning over the next six and a half years.  Sometimes time <br/>
passes slowly, and sometimes it speeds by, and there is a lesson  in focus, and in <br/>
flow, and in biochemistry.  <br/>
Some people collect bugs, or rocks, or videotapes. It&#39;s cheaper  and easier <br/>
to collect words. If you have a name which is a noun, like &quot;Lynn&quot; or  &quot;Holly&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Gill&quot; you&#39;ve probably developed an ear for hearing it and an eye for  <br/>
seeing it in various contexts and have probably looked it up in dictionaries and  <br/>
name books to see how old it is. This can be done with morning and joy and tree <br/>
 and wind. I should have put quotation marks on those, &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;joy&quot; <br/>
and so  forth, to show that I mean the word morning, not the thing-in-the-sky <br/>
morning.  Now we&#39;re talking about punctuation, the mechanics of writing, and the <br/>
branch of  philosophy called ontology, about what &quot;being&quot; is-is the word <br/>
&quot;morning&quot; part of  morning itself? Is morning inside my head? Where does a &quot;real&quot; <br/>
morning end and  just talking and thinking about morning start? Can you prete<br/>
nd morning?  <br/>
You can spend $20 on a Mensa-approved plastic puzzle, or a book  of mind- <br/>
bending questions, or you can just look out the window, name things,  and think. <br/>
You can play with a dictionary, ask each other odd questions, and  look up the <br/>
answers. It&#39;s the thinking that counts, the idea-getting, the  biochemical <br/>
ping when the light of a new concept dawns in your mind.  <br/>
When people begin homeschooling, that&#39;s a big bright morning,  but you can <br/>
have as many mornings as you need. If you want to change the way  you&#39;re being <br/>
or thinking, just do it. Don&#39;t wait for another year, another  month, another <br/>
day. Good morning!  <br/>
