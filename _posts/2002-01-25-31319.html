When I used to hire people, if I was looking for entry level, I&#39;d check <br/>
their education out.<br/>
<br/>
If I was looking for experience, I&#39;d look at their experience only. <br/>
Didn&#39;t care about their education.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this is right or wrong, but as someone who hired a lot of <br/>
people in my life, this is how I did it. <br/>
<br/>
Just something to keep in mind.<br/>
