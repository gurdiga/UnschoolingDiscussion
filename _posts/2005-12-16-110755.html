<div id="ygrps-yiv-474679951">I think it was probably six years ago when I first had Adobe  <br/>
Photoshop, and it was a fairly big one (though home version), with  <br/>
cloning and all.  I used it to take specks off old photos I&#39;d  <br/>
scanned, and to crop photos.  Sometimes I&#39;d put captions in on the  <br/>
image itself (as I did for the conference hotel photos at http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/abq ).  I&#39;ve isolated a person from a group photo, and  <br/>
messed with scanner art (objects laid flat on the scanner&#39;s surface,  <br/>
such as what&#39;s at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/museum">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a> ).  The background of  <br/>
the cover of Moving a Puddle was first made for the background of  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/hippieshirt">http://sandradodd.com/hippieshirt</a> (cloth scanned and then the image  <br/>
lightened).<br/>
<br/>
That computer started to glitch up after several years and switched  <br/>
to a PC laptop, and so bought a very inexpensive &quot;last year&#39;s model&quot;  <br/>
Adobe Photoshop Elements 2, a smaller version.  No cloning, just  <br/>
eyedropper...  For a while after I got my new Mac I used a trial  <br/>
version of Photoshop 4, and then put in the little Elements 2.  (The  <br/>
older, larger version doesn&#39;t work with OSX.)<br/>
<br/>
Because Photoshop is still on that laptop which has now become  <br/>
&quot;Holly&#39;s computer,&quot; I&#39;ve told her it&#39;s there,  and that it&#39;s  <br/>
basically KidPix and she should mess with it, but Holly&#39;s online life  <br/>
involves chatting with other people (mostly people she met at HesFes  <br/>
and at Live and Learn, which is cool).  She just shrugs and says  <br/>
maybe someday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty asked me for the disk because he wanted to try it.<br/>
<br/>
You all probably know what I&#39;m going to say. &lt;g&gt;  Within half an  <br/>
hour, Marty had discovered more than I ever had, had determined that  <br/>
just about every function had options and settings, and figured out  <br/>
how to do layers, add word bubbles and to reverse them and color them  <br/>
and resize and how to make it look like someone&#39;s ghost was coming  <br/>
out of them (if they were wearing black anyway) and how to resize  <br/>
images and...<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of when he first got on roller blades.  He just flew  <br/>
like a bird that had been in a cage before and finally got the sky.<br/>
<br/>
He was giddy.  He called me in there at least ten times to show me  <br/>
something really exciting.  He played with it intently for two or  <br/>
three hours.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing for me now is that if I want to do something and  <br/>
don&#39;t know how, Marty can help me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an effect of everything Marty has ever played, done, thought and  <br/>
seen.  His hours of messing with KidPix came to fruition bigtime last  <br/>
night.  I&#39;m glad I got to witness it (and help a little bit).<br/>
<br/>
I wish this had happened before I bought Marty&#39;s Christmas stuff,  <br/>
because a bigger, newer Photoshop might&#39;ve been a great gift.  But  <br/>
he&#39;s about to have a job, and the Photoshop Elements isn&#39;t too  <br/>
expensive, $80 or $100, if he gets more serious about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823702632">Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if we wanted to drop a bunch like that, I could write a letter  <br/>
saying I&#39;d like to &quot;use it in our homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I bought this computer I wanted to buy Microsoft Word (stunning  <br/>
that they don&#39;t come with a word processing program anymore), and the  <br/>
salesman was cute.  He said &quot;You&#39;re a teacher, right?&quot;  I said no,  <br/>
not really.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well your kids are students, right?&quot;   No, they&#39;re just home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But you&#39;re *teaching* them.&quot;  And he looked at me really hard like  <br/>
&quot;HINT! AGREE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, yeah.  Yeah.&quot;  I said, and he sold me a student version for way  <br/>
cheaper. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

astound me. At 5, he&#39;s so adept at Ages of Mythology, creating his own <br/>
game scenarios and everything. We got together with another local <br/>
unschooling family this week, and the 10 year old was asking Sam how to <br/>
do stuff in AoM. The critical thinking skills just blow me away!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149031140">Hey Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Love this story! This is the way I&#39;ve basically developed my  <br/>
technologist skills, tinkering around with software and hardware. So  <br/>
I&#39;m going to share with you a little secret. Actually, the worst kept  <br/>
secret in the web dev business :  GIMP  [ www.gimp.org ], an open- <br/>
source and free alternative to Photoshop :<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gimp.org/about/introduction.html">http://www.gimp.org/about/introduction.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a  <br/>
&gt; freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching,  <br/>
&gt; image composition and image authoring.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program,  <br/>
&gt; an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch  <br/>
&gt; processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image  <br/>
&gt; format converter, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented  <br/>
&gt; with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The  <br/>
&gt; advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest  <br/>
&gt; task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily  <br/>
&gt; scripted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; GIMP is written and developed under X11 on UNIX platforms. But  <br/>
&gt; basically the same code also runs on MS Windows and Mac OS X.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tell Marty it&#39;s my merry secular holiday gift to him ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
