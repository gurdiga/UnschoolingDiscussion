CELEBRATE YOUTH!: A CONFERENCE ON LIBERATION<br/>
February 15-17, 2002 * St. Petersburg, Florida<br/>
**********************************************<br/>
*    We want to learn and grow and play!    *<br/>
*                  We want to be young!                 *<br/>
*                 We want to be free!                      *<br/>
**********************************************<br/>
We are a group of students, teachers, artists, activists, musicians, <br/>
writers,journalists, filmmakers and farmers. We are kids, and we ware <br/>
fed up with the way that we and our peers are treated. Young people <br/>
are capable of playing a vital role in our communities. Throughout <br/>
time, we have participated in progressive political action. However,<br/>
adults often overlook our potential and fail to support us. Parents, <br/>
teachers and other adults in our lives ignore and marginalize our <br/>
views.<br/>
<br/>
WE WANT OUR VOICES BACK!<br/>
We are locked up for seven or more hours a day, for at least 13 <br/>
years. We are forced to &quot;learn&quot; things that aren&#39;t useful or <br/>
applicable to our lives and that often aren&#39;t even true. We are <br/>
taught to obey, to keep our opinions to ourselves and to remain <br/>
silent. We are groomed to enter the workforce. We targeted by<br/>
corporations that prey on us as lucrative customers.<br/>
<br/>
WE WANT OUR MINDS BACK!<br/>
We are punished for pursuing our dreams. We are raised and <br/>
indoctrinated into a culture of racism, sexism, ageism and violence. <br/>
We are forbidden from being in public during certain hours of the day.<br/>
<br/>
WE WANT OUR FUN BACK!<br/>
We are taught not to question or challenge our own oppression or that <br/>
of others. We learn onlyn how to operate within and perpetuate <br/>
authoritative relationships. We want to escape these destructive <br/>
environments.<br/>
<br/>
WE WANT OUR LIVES BACK!<br/>
For all of these reasons, we are organizing Celebrate Youth!: A <br/>
Conference onLiberation, a three-day gathering in scheduled for Feb. <br/>
15-17 in St. Petersburg,Florida. The conference will incorporate <br/>
serious discussion, analyses of the problems facing youth today and <br/>
constructive workshops that equip us with the tools we need to <br/>
dismantle these oppressive systems in favor of a healthier<br/>
approach to learning and living. Of course, we will also have fun with<br/>
activities such as games, movies, picnics, a concert, free-form <br/>
performances andbike rides through the city. Through this conference, <br/>
we hope to empower youth and adults from a variety of communities and <br/>
diverse backgrounds to begin building a society based on freedom and <br/>
respect, rather than oppression and domination.<br/>
<br/>
HOW CAN YOU HELP?<br/>
We are looking for people to speak at the conference, facilitate <br/>
workshops, donate money and resources and spread the word of the <br/>
conference in their communities. Please get in touch to let us know <br/>
what you can do to help. We look forward to working with you to end <br/>
the oppression and marginalization of youth everywhere.<br/>
