<div id="ygrps-yiv-718178580"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Even though she&#39;s lost parts of her memory she&#39;s sweet with them, gives them<br/>
&gt;  lots of attention, talks to them & hugs them.  Something she was slow to do<br/>
&gt;  even when I was growing up.  (Do you think it had anything to do with her<br/>
&gt;  being a ps teacher?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I do. My parents were ps teachers, too, and very distant. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also realized that while they did some things well, they were bad <br/>
teachers. For instance, my mother was a very good housekeeper, but my sister <br/>
and I are not. I struggle with this a lot, and am now reading up books and <br/>
web sites to learn the things my mom did, but didn&#39;t pass on.<br/>
<br/>
They are also financially secure, but all their kids are poor, because they <br/>
didn&#39;t pass on the skills for money management.  :-( <br/>
