I wish  it were tommorrow. I kept my mouth shut because I didn&#39;t want to step <br/>
on  Catherine&#39;s toes but I was getting a little steamed myself at the dentist <br/>
and  her half distracted conversation. If she didn&#39;t want answers why ask the <br/>
 questions? Imagine how interesting it could have been for her if she&#39;d just  <br/>
listened. Oh well...Her loss.<br/>

But I did get to explain unschooling to my son&#39;s dentist while he was  asking <br/>
Will the same kinds of questions.  I even used Will&#39;s experience  with an <br/>
abcessed tooth as an example of experiential learning.  ;)<br/>
