<div id="ygrps-yiv-954172158">I had big emotions when I was 10.  Still do.  I have cut off all my hair and regretted it bitterly.  My mom shrugged it off.  <br/>
<br/>
What would have helped me was if she just sat there and nodded at me while I was sad, angry at myself, rageful.  Once that was all through, I would have felt a lot better, as my big emotions and feelings were addressed and honored.  Then if she had helped me brainstorm what to do with myself while the hair grew back, it would have been nice.  We could have looked on line for pictures of people with hair like mine (in its &#39;distressing&#39; state) that I respected or thought were cool.  We could go shopping for costume wigs and hair color.  We could have gotten on you tube tutorial channels to discover new styles I could try with my shorter tresses.  Those things would have helped me get through the horror I felt at having short hair.  <br/>
