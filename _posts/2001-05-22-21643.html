&gt; I&#39;ve tried that, but I do worry that my three-year old might veg out too<br/>
&gt; much infront of the TV if I let him. He watces videos - so that is okay,<br/>
&gt; but he can really get mesmerised by it all. I don&#39;t restrict it yet, but I<br/>
&gt; always try to suggest another activity when he asks to watch TV. Sometimes<br/>
&gt; he takes it and others not. I don&#39;t mind some vegging.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughters, on and off, watch a lot of TV. We make no restrictions to<br/>
amount, and some (but not a lot) for content.<br/>
<br/>
For the past few days, the girls (6 and 3) time has been spent, almost<br/>
without pause except for sleeping and eating, in performing the Dexter&#39;s Lab<br/>
Opera/Musical episode, which we have on a Dexter&#39;s Lab Marathon tape. They<br/>
are doing this complete with choreography, sound effects, and in the case of<br/>
my three year old, a very realistic rendering of Dexter&#39;s voice.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents might think, &quot;Great googly moogly, they watch way too much TV<br/>
since they memorized THAT whole thing!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think, &quot;Cool.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, BTW, kids are on to the &quot;suggest another activity&quot; scam. He knows that<br/>
means you secretly don&#39;t want him to watch TV, and it&#39;s almost certainly<br/>
making it MORE important to him than if you really didn&#39;t mind. Basic mammal<br/>
psychology -- and the reason cats always want in the lap of the people who<br/>
don&#39;t like them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hehehe had to giggle at that. The thing is I just think TV is just such an easy way out when he gets bored.<br/>
