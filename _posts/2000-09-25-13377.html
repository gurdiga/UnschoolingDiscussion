Yes, in new Zealand we celebrate christmas during the summer.  It is <br/>
actually our summer holidays. Which takes away the thrill of <br/>
christmas as most people are too busy planning their vacations.<br/>
Some people celebrate with the tradionally Christmas dinner - but <br/>

morning - having snow would be a bonus - sitting in front of an open <br/>

all the trimmings - not forgetting the chrismas pud and brandy sauce..<br/>
That christmas feeling just never seems to happen in the middle of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027801010">Here in California we have all the different climates all rolled into one<br/>
state.  We have areas that are snowed in and where blizzards are not<br/>
uncommon.  We have areas where people go to the beach all year round.  We<br/>
have Death Valley where you can cook during the day and freeze at night. <br/>
We have areas where the only thing you see all winter is rain.  And we have<br/>
areas like here where the temp doesn&#39;t vary but by about 10 degrees all<br/>
year round and we don&#39;t really have &quot;seasons&quot; as such.<br/>

<br/>
I live in New England and we have seasons. Winter is the longest and most<br/>
pronounced. Fall is beautiful with the foliage and Spring has lots of rain,<br/>
but these 2 seasons are pretty shot. The summers can be very hot although<br/>
this one was pretty cool and rainy. More like an extended Spring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180963678">We live in Florida so Christmas for us isn&#39;t the snow white blanket outside<br/>
with a fire in the fireplace (unless we set the air conditioner to 55).<br/>
<br/>
We have dinner at my in-laws with my husbands two brothers & their families<br/>
if they can get into town on Christmas eve.  The kids & I do lots at church<br/>
leading up to the grand event.  Christmas morning we open gifts at our house<br/>
with the children then go back to the in-laws for breakfast.  But before<br/>
that the kids open another round of presents.  This is what they refer to as<br/>
stuffing on toast.  It&#39;s hot Jimmy Dean sausage, stock and bread stuffing<br/>
mixed.  It&#39;s even better a few days old.  MIL is Italian, FIL French so I<br/>
don&#39;t know where this came from but it&#39;s an old tradition for them.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are the ones we buy the gifts for but try to make it things they<br/>
need & not a lot of toys (got enough of those to last).  For the adults my<br/>
MIL will draw names for each & we exchange a gift for that one only with a<br/>
$50. limit.  Usually the person who draws your name asks what you&#39;d like.<br/>
I&#39;ve made most of our gifts for this exchange, scarfs went over good and<br/>
were real easy.  I did them when I was confined to the hospital bed with a<br/>
pregnancy just before Christmas till Dec 17.  Last year I gave both my<br/>
sister & mother-in-law a small jar with a cork lid & a package of<br/>
multicolored small notepads and a note.  When something worth remembering<br/>
happens in the family you date a note & write it down & put it in the jar.<br/>
On New Year&#39;s Eve (or Christmas) the family is to sit down read through all<br/>
the events of the year now past.  We have graduation, first date, etc.  This<br/>
was a hit.<br/>
<br/>
We have another dinner with the family at the in-laws around 1-2pm.  At 4pm<br/>
Christmas Day is over.  Everyone comes to our house for our first dd&#39;s<br/>
birthday.  No presents in Christmas wrapping!  We have an ice cream cake<br/>
which she helps to make & decorate.  The birthday parties have always been<br/>
just family but this year she wants to have a &quot;Name Day Party&quot; (Greek<br/>
Orthodox) on her name day November 25 and invite her friends.</div>

<br/>
Greeks have name days?  I only knew about Swedish name days. (today&#39;s name<br/>
is &quot;Signild&quot;, if you were wondering)  My birthday is Dec 20th so it is<br/>
thoroughly forgotten by all but a handfull of people.  If my mother had<br/>
given me a Swedish name I could have celebrated my name day instead of my<br/>
birthday or a half-birthday in June. That&#39;s a great idea of your daughter&#39;s.<br/>
(I hope Thanksgiving won&#39;t interfere.)<br/>

PS I really hated getting birthday presents in Christmas wrap or combination<br/>

Thanksgiving?) and the next we&#39;ll be in shirt sleeves.  Most of the time <br/>
we&#39;re wearing light jackets.  We rarely get snow -- once a year if we&#39;re <br/>

mid-afternoon let down on Christmas Day is remarkable.  And what about the <br/>
day after?  Don&#39;t they call that Boxing Day in some parts of the English <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417999258">Boxing Day was traditionally the day when the nobs would give <br/>
their staff and tradesmen presents, in boxes...  these days it&#39;s the <br/>
day for soccer matches, watching the 30yo James Bond film on <br/>
the telly, fox-hunting (or hunt-protesting, or neither, whatever <br/>
one&#39;s persuasion)  Dh&#39;s family and their friends have traditionally <br/>
had a party on Boxing Day, but since one of the families is heavily <br/>
involved in the town football club, it&#39;s out, so now it&#39;s sometime <br/>
later.  I&#39;d like to reinvent this tradition for us, but dd2&#39;s birthday is <br/>
30th Dec, so we&#39;d be a bit &#39;party-heavy&#39; what with Yule, <br/>
Christmas at the gp&#39;s and New Year...  Anyone else have any <br/>
good ideas for celebrating birthdays in the midst of end-of-year <br/>
hols?<br/>

My FILs bday is 01 Jan. Lasy year we had a nice family brunch at his home.<br/>
It was very calm and a nice change from the whole dinner/cake/ice cream<br/>
thing. We had french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, eggs benedict and of<br/>
coursr mimosas and bloody marys. Probably not quite the party a kidlet would<br/>
envision, but we loved it * -)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brunch is a nice idea.  I have a husband with a birthday on Dec. 16th, a son with a birthday on Dec. 22nd, a sister in law with a birthday on Dec. 2nd, and another with a birthday on Dec. 11th, and a mother in law with a birthday on Dec. 25th.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably this year we will only be seeing hubby and sons birthdays, since we decided not to travel during the holidays.  Son wants a pirate party, or a star wars party, or a knight party, or a dinosaur party (he says.)  He is waffling, but we are probably going to go with pirate.  A brinch sounds like a nice idea for hubby though.  If only we could have some family come for the party, but they are too far away.  We have no relatives within a two state radius, and we are all alone here.<br/>
