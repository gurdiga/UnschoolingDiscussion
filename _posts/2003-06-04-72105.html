<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986213656">Hi!  I&#39;m Christina.  I&#39;m homeschooling my 13-year-old son -- pulled him<br/>
out of school last year &lt;whew!&gt;.  We live in Central Mass.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
&quot;sitting in&quot; for about a week now, trying to get a feel for the group,<br/>
and I&#39;m having a great time listening to everyone.  I&#39;d like some<br/>
feedback on how to unschool during the high school years since my son<br/>
will be 9th grade this year.  When I first pulled him out of school, I<br/>
played the good little teacher, sat him down, presented applicable<br/>
materials for his age, etc., etc.  He did his work, albeit grudgingly<br/>
most of the time, but I didn&#39;t see any motivation kicking in (still<br/>
working on desensitizing him from his public school experience).  I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize it until I started reading about unschooling and joined<br/>
your great group, but I think that I have been unschooling during the<br/>
last half of this school year, and we&#39;re both more relaxed about the<br/>
whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
My concern now is how to unschool during high school, especially since<br/>
I&#39;d like to see him in college (he doesn&#39;t want to see himself there -<br/>
&quot;hates&quot; school, but I think he&#39;ll come around when he sees how much fun<br/>
true learning really is).  Don&#39;t I have to keep detailed records, assign<br/>
&quot;credits&quot;, etc. in order to prepare transcripts to present to any<br/>
potential college?   Ugghhh!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my &quot;doable&quot; has to be the co-star (I can&#39;t remember his<br/>
name), Sully, on &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.&quot;  Ride &#39;em cowboy!!<br/>

<br/>
No.  You can&#39;t give credit anyway.  Credit, from 9th grade on, is a real <br/>
(within school-context) thing, only given by accredited schools.  So don&#39;t worry <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to invest some time and money (not much) go to google and look up <br/>
Cafi Cohen college  and you&#39;ll get info on a couple of books Cafi Cohen, a <br/>
homeschooling mom, has written on preparing applications for college.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s overkill, generally, unless HE wants college and you want to apply <br/>
for scholarships and such.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing (and could be wrong) that your vision of college is a four year <br/>
block of life that needs to start when he&#39;s 17 or 18.<br/>
<br/>
If you can just undo that vision, you&#39;ll both be vastly happier.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll want to take a college class when he&#39;s 14 or 16, just to see what <br/>
it&#39;s like.  Maybe there are continuuing ed or community ed classes around <br/>
there that aren&#39;t &quot;academic&quot; (photography, local fauna, rock climbing) that he <br/>
might enjoy for meeting people and doing something different, or maybe he wants <br/>
to be away from schoolish stuff altogether for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Try to chill for a year.  Act like you&#39;re on vacation.  Sometimes do a <br/>
touristy thing that you would do if you were visiting wherever you are (or had out <br/>
of town company) but that locals rarely do because it&#39;s expensive.  In <br/>
Albuquerque, that would be have lunch on Sandid Crest, having ridden the Tram up.  <br/>
Maybe do an overnight vacation to a play or musical or touring museum show in <br/>
another town.  Stay in a motel, or with friends, or camp (or sleep in the van), <br/>
but make it an adventure.  It doesn&#39;t have to cost a fortune to have an <br/>
adventure!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m learning from my son, who will be a &quot;junior&quot; next <br/>
year according to the state. I don&#39;t have a clue what will be right <br/>
for him when he hits 18. I loved college. My husband loved <br/>
college. But we were products of 12 years of schooling. College <br/>
was the big reward for years of drudgery.<br/>
<br/>
But my son doesn&#39;t know if it will be a fit for him. This terrified me <br/>
at first until I began really watching him. If I create a goal for him, <br/>
then I will work to enforce the requirements that goal demands. <br/>
Next thing you know, I&#39;m back to organizing and controlling his <br/>
life. And he&#39;s back to putting his passions on hold for <br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest encouragement to me was the realization that <br/>
anyone can go to college... really. Colleges need students and <br/>
money. Anyone can register as a special student, bypassing the <br/>
admissions process, proving that he or she is capable of <br/>
college level work and then enrolling in a program. I&#39;m about to <br/>
do this very thing to get a Master&#39;s!<br/>
<br/>
Once I faced the fact that my son may not care about <br/>
scholarships or admissions requirements but might some day <br/>
choose to go to college, I relaxed. He&#39;ll figure it out with my help if <br/>
he wants it when he catches the vision of what college might <br/>
mean for his life. But right now, it&#39;s not in his line of sight as <br/>
clearly as it was in mine so I&#39;m adjusting to that reality. He&#39;s got <br/>
more important things to do like:<br/>
<br/>
mastering Rachmaninoff pieces, Vanessa Carlotn&#39;s pop music, <br/>
Mozart and Scott Joplin on the piano. He&#39;s transposing songs for <br/>
fun. He&#39;s created three games in Visual Baisc and hangs out <br/>
online with programmers. He reads voraciously and asked me <br/>
to buy &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; on tape last night at a book sale. <br/>
He acts in a Shakespeare camp every summer. He plays <br/>
Lacrosse and watches MTV and taught himself guitar and <br/>
listens to heavy metal. He plays with his siblings and is kind to <br/>
them. He cleans up the dishes just because they&#39;re dirty. He <br/>
leaves his room a total mess all the time. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a great kid! And if college is something *he* wants, I have <br/>
no doubt he&#39;ll get there. And we&#39;ll do everything we can to help <br/>
him when he makes that choice.<br/>
<br/>
I just had to let go of thinking I could manage that goal for him. <br/>
And I had to let go of meeting &#39;requuirements&#39; in order to see him <br/>
blossom the way he has.<br/>
