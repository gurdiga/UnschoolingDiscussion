My dh was a little skepical at first.  Was always asking if we had <br/>
done school work today......  I asked him if he remembered anything <br/>
that he had learned at school. He had to think about that - and then <br/>
i asked him how much of what he had learned at school he needed for <br/>
the job he now does. he had to think about that too!<br/>
Now dh is all for unschooling, especially as dd can now go to work <br/>
with him whenever she wants too - which is more and more these days - <br/>
he loves her company and the way she makes him laugh...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband and I are definitely in agreement on unschooling, but we come to<br/>
it from two completely different paths. I was a straight-A student who was<br/>
bored to tears in school. I was a rebel with a pink mohawk who was pissed<br/>
off at the cage I was in, but was able (by virtue of good memorization<br/>
skills) to spew the necessary answers to any test I had to take. I left high<br/>
school early without a diploma and got into college on the strength of my<br/>
SATs. Graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa and all that happy hoo-ha<br/>
:-). Got a job (at Microsoft) in a field totally unrelated to my degree<br/>
(which was Art). Did not follow my passion (photography), though it has<br/>
always been a hobby I&#39;ve pursued.<br/>
OTOH, my husband was a high school &quot;failure&quot; who dropped out and then went<br/>
back and took his GED. He was &quot;hyperactive&quot; and a &quot;daydreamer&quot; (and probably<br/>
would&#39;ve been on Ritalin these days). But when he really wanted to study<br/>
something, he was brilliant (he got his pilot&#39;s license as a teenager with<br/>
no problem, and I can tell you that the written exam for that is a lot<br/>
tougher than anything you&#39;d see in a high school class). He went into the<br/>
Army for 10 years, then got his Associate&#39;s degree in aircraft maintenance<br/>
when he got out. Started his own aviation-related business in the evenings<br/>
while I worked the day shift.  Now his business is thriving, and he&#39;s<br/>
branched out into all sorts of other things that he&#39;s never done before<br/>
(right now he&#39;s being a contractor on his 2nd hangar-building project) and<br/>
I&#39;m a SAHM. So I guess you could say he&#39;s &quot;unjobbing&quot; as he loves owning his<br/>
own business and deciding what kind of work he wants to do. Along the way,<br/>
he&#39;s learned everything he needed to know that he didn&#39;t learn in school.<br/>
One night, for instance, we went over fractions together because he hadn&#39;t<br/>
retained that from school. Which just shows you that when you really need<br/>
and want to learn something, it&#39;s usually a snap to pick it up. He can do<br/>
fractions in his head now much faster than I can, because he uses them a lot<br/>
on a daily basis. Yet the math score on my SAT test was probably double of<br/>
his. So what does a test tell you about anything?? diddly squat.<br/>
<br/>
From these two disparate experiences, we have both come to the conclusion<br/>
that our schooling did not serve us well, did not teach us the lessons we<br/>
truly needed to know, and was a monumental waste of time and energy, not to<br/>
mention emotionally and mentally crippling. We both feel fortunate that we<br/>
were able to break the chains on our imaginations and let our lives carry us<br/>
to where we wanted to be. We feel that it is the birthright of our children<br/>
not to have to go through that humiliating and debilitating experience that<br/>
is commonly called &quot;public education&quot;. We love to travel and plan to spend a<br/>
lot of our kids&#39; unschooling years in different locales, flying our airplane<br/>
around, or in different countries. For us, the road to unschooling started<br/>
with questioning the commonly accepted notions of hospital birth, and the<br/>
decision to birth with a midwife outside of a hospital led us to attachment<br/>
parenting, extended nursing, and to a host of alternative child-rearing<br/>
practices, culminating in the vision of a life in which learning is an<br/>
integral part and not a drudgery imposed from without. I will forever feel<br/>
grateful that we came to this path before our first child was even born.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048578240">Wow, Robin it sound like our lives  and our husband&#39;s lives took a very similar path. I was a bright student, bored to tears. I did excellent in the classes I liked and was interested in and couldn&#39;t be bothered in the ones I found boring. I also went to college for art, but dropped out because I couldn&#39;t stomach the &quot;Starving Artist&quot; mentality on our campus. My husband was a high school dropout who got his GED and would have been considered hyperactive etc. also. He was sent to a &quot;troubled boy&quot; school during his jr high years. He often astounds me with insight to the business world that he learned on the streets as a teenager and he has an uncanny knack for spotting phony people. <br/>
