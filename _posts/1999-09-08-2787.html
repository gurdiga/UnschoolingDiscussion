<div id="ygrps-yiv-316335232"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I guess this brings me to the point of asking if there are other<br/>
&gt;unschoolers out there that had kids in ps?  I&#39;m the only one in my support<br/>
&gt;group out here and there is not a lot they seem to be able to tell me in<br/>
&gt;overcoming these challenges.  I want to get rid of the I want to get &#39;done&#39;<br/>
&gt;syndrome as well as that rotten schedule - uck!  She is a great kid but<br/>
&gt;does want to be told what to learn and how to learn it.  She has only been<br/>
&gt;out of ps 1 year so perhaps I&#39;m expecting a bit too much just yet.  Hmmmmm,<br/>
&gt;so much to unravel.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, my 14.5 daughter was in public school until 5th grade and for 9 weeks<br/>
of 8th grade. She is also one that wants me to tell her what to do so that<br/>
she can fuss about having to get anything done. She is now in 9th grade and<br/>
and ever wants to do anything other than watch tv or chat on the computer or<br/>
listen to  music.  She does volunteer for about 4 hours per week, because I<br/>
insist that she get out of the house and do something constructive.  When I<br/>
have asked her what she wants to do with her time and energy, I get &quot;hang<br/>
with my friends and talk on the phone & chat on the computer.&quot;   She says<br/>
that she wants to take advantage of the dual enrollment program at the local<br/>
community college when she is 16 but will not do any of the preliminary work<br/>
of seeing what the requirements are. She wants to work parttime for money<br/>
but will not put in applications, and on the one that I carried her to put<br/>
in she won&#39;t call back to follow up.<br/>
<br/>
WE are in our third year of homeschooling (the first year was more<br/>
structured-not quite school at home).  Last year we were much more relaxed<br/>
and this year even more so.  She has basically deschooled since December 98<br/>
when she left public school the last time.  She doesn&#39;t want to get involved<br/>
with any of the homeschool groups in the area.  Her friends are those from<br/>
church and people that she meets thru them.  Even though I give her<br/>
assignments,because she says that she wants me to so that she knows what she<br/>
needs to get done, she can&#39;t wait for 3:00 when &quot;school is out&quot;. It will<br/>
take her more than a week to complete the 2 1/2 days of work I give to her.<br/>
Sometimes I feel as if she has dropped out of school legally under the guise<br/>
of homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
My other older teens were never quite this way.  They seemed to go after<br/>
things and were more involved with life.  They had outside interests (not<br/>
always good wholesome ones but outside interest none the less!!)  They were<br/>
public schooled.<br/>
<br/>
I am lucky that the 4 yo hasn&#39;t taken after her.  He is very interested in<br/>
doing all sorts of neat things.  He is constantly busy and self motivated.<br/>
If I get too involved in his &quot;work&quot;, he quits and looses interest. He told<br/>
his best little friend the other day &quot;I&#39;m lucky.  I have more teachers than<br/>
you.  I have my music teacher (he takes a Kindermusic class), my Sunday<br/>
School teacher and my mom teacher.  You only have your pre-school teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any answers.  But, you aren&#39;t alone.  Good luck<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 You know, just now, reading your post, it struck me ( and, ok, I know I am <br/>
not the sharpest knife in the drawer!) that, if each child has a learning <br/>
style of their own, then each child might do best with different styles of <br/>
hsing.  My oldest needs the structure of things, my youngest doesn&#39;t.  My <br/>
oldest is not creative in the least, he is struggeling to learn to read and <br/>
put into his own words what he read.  Now, he can read it and tell you every <br/>
word, word for word, but not translate it to his own words.  The youngest is <br/>
just the opposite, very creative, and can tell you a million stories, based <br/>
on one paragraph.  So, while I need to be relaxed with them both, I can not <br/>
completely let go, at least at this point, with the oldest.  Maybe my goal <br/>
for this year for him should be for him to just free write stuff and <br/>
interpret everything in his own words.   Hmmmm, something for me to evaluate <br/>
here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897726674">I wonder if the difficulty some folks have with their kids &quot;deschooling&quot; may be<br/>
related to matters of religious belief.  Now I have some trepidation in bringing<br/>
this up and I want to do it in a diplomatic and respectful way.<br/>
<br/>
It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission to<br/>
authority is a basic tenet of faith.  I have wondered whether unschooling is<br/>
compatible with a faith which requires belief and reliance on a greater authority.<br/>
It may be a difficult task to encourage freedom of thought and choice on the one<br/>
hand and &quot;unquestioning&quot; obedience on the other.<br/>
<br/>
Again I believe absolutely in the right of people to follow their conscience and<br/>
hearts in matters of faith and to share those with their children.  I am genuinely<br/>
interested in the possible conflict posed by some religious points of view and many<br/>
of the concepts I associate with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure some people don&#39;t see it as a conflict and I would be interested in<br/>
hearing from them.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what I mean?<br/>

<br/>
I do not have a conflict with our religious beliefs and unschooling. Now, I <br/>
am relatively new to the unschooling thing, but I feel it is the same as <br/>
teaching our children respect for other people, or to follow the law. My <br/>
children are taught to follow the bible AND that God has given them a great <br/>
mind which they should use to fulfill the purpose God has planned for them. <br/>
This purpose is not laid out by myself or any other, it is theirs to discover <br/>
on their own. As long as they love God and accept that all are created in <br/>
God&#39;s image, thus making them deserving of love also, I have no problem <br/>
letting go and letting them flourish. I trust this is not much different than <br/>
most, non-Christian parents hope. (The god may be different but the idea is <br/>
probably similar.) <br/>
I too am interested in hearing from others on this point.<br/>

with all of my might to encourage as much reading as I can around here,<br/>
public school kind of killed the joy of it for my children, by insisting<br/>
that they read only what the teacher thought was appropriate grade level! we<br/>
are working on getting the love of reading back, but it has been a long<br/>
haul, I don&#39;t think I would discourage it , maybe leave out some other<br/>
really interesting things to read that maybe they would pick up!<br/>

the phone and watch tv, I may be different than most of you unschooling, I<br/>
don&#39;t know, I do not push them or even nudge them to do anything, but I am<br/>
willing to  say that only educational tv is allowed in our house, and I have<br/>
said as long as you are doing something to expand your brain  I will leave<br/>

something they can learn something from!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yea!  I&#39;ve even been told you can&#39;t be a Christian and Unschool.  A<br/>
friend from the past recently wrote me that she was terrified of<br/>
unschooling both academically and spiritually.  She never responded to my<br/>
attempts to show her that unschooling is simply a method and does not need<br/>
to cross purposes with the authority you speak of above.  <br/>
<br/>
The conflict is certainly there with people of authoritarian natures.  I<br/>
grew up under a very authoritarian heavy hand and know what the thinking<br/>
is.  But growing up that way I guess I see the down side and don&#39;t want my<br/>
kids to be &#39;broken&#39; like that.  I encourage them to question - even<br/>
spiritual authority (except God&#39;s of course) - and it does bring it&#39;s<br/>
challenges.  We just went through a discussion on this recently in our<br/>
family.  Then I reminded my dh that we had done all we could to teach our<br/>
kids to look for options when confronted with a roadblock.  So when there<br/>
was something they want and we said no, they would try a dozen different<br/>
ways to get us to change our minds - questioning why or why not, etc.  We<br/>
had to laugh, we would rather put up with what authoritarians view as<br/>
argumentativeness and bucking authority and have kids that can think for<br/>
themselves and find other options when life gives them a roadblock.  Yes,<br/>
it is certainly in conflict with some people&#39;s spiritual lives.  But I<br/>
believe that it would do many people a lot of good to learn to question the<br/>
authority of those in charge at churches.  But that is another story for<br/>
another day :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045654325">as a christian i believe we should question authority because we can be sheep lead<br/>
astray. we need to know why we believe what we believe, somethings must be taken on<br/>
faith but most things of god can be explained. i have no problem w/ my kids questioning<br/>
my decisions for them. if i say no to a request they are welcome to ask why. we should<br/>
know why we do the things we do.<br/>

&gt; I wonder if the difficulty some folks have with their kids &quot;deschooling&quot; may be<br/>
&gt; related to matters of religious belief.  Now I have some trepidation in bringing<br/>
&gt; this up and I want to do it in a diplomatic and respectful way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission to<br/>
&gt; authority is a basic tenet of faith.  I have wondered whether unschooling is<br/>
&gt; compatible with a faith which requires belief and reliance on a greater authority.<br/>
&gt; It may be a difficult task to encourage freedom of thought and choice on the one<br/>
&gt; hand and &quot;unquestioning&quot; obedience on the other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again I believe absolutely in the right of people to follow their conscience and<br/>
&gt; hearts in matters of faith and to share those with their children.  I am genuinely<br/>
&gt; interested in the possible conflict posed by some religious points of view and many<br/>
&gt; of the concepts I associate with unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am sure some people don&#39;t see it as a conflict and I would be interested in<br/>
&gt; hearing from them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know what I mean?<br/>

&gt; Oh My!! I can&#39;t even immagine wanting to discourage reading! I am trying<br/>
&gt; with all of my might to encourage as much reading as I can around here,<br/>
&gt; public school kind of killed the joy of it for my children, by insisting<br/>
&gt; that they read only what the teacher thought was appropriate grade level! we<br/>
&gt; are working on getting the love of reading back, but it has been a long<br/>
&gt; haul, I don&#39;t think I would discourage it , maybe leave out some other<br/>
&gt; really interesting things to read that maybe they would pick up!<br/>
&gt; and for the moms with the teens that are only wanting to chat and talk on<br/>
&gt; the phone and watch tv, I may be different than most of you unschooling, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know, I do not push them or even nudge them to do anything, but I am<br/>
&gt; willing to  say that only educational tv is allowed in our house, and I have<br/>
&gt; said as long as you are doing something to expand your brain  I will leave<br/>
&gt; you alone!  and that does come in many forms, tv being one of them if it is<br/>
&gt; something they can learn something from!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003696319">Don&#39;t be nervous, Joel.  I think you posed some great questions and the whole <br/>
post was very diplomatic!<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt; I wonder if the difficulty some folks have with their kids &quot;deschooling&quot; <br/>
may be<br/>
 related to matters of religious belief.  Now I have some trepidation in <br/>
bringing<br/>
 this up and I want to do it in a diplomatic and respectful way. <br/>
 It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission <br/>
to<br/>
 authority is a basic tenet of faith.  I have wondered whether unschooling is<br/>
 compatible with a faith which requires belief and reliance on a greater <br/>
authority.<br/>
 It may be a difficult task to encourage freedom of thought and choice on the <br/>
one<br/>
 hand and &quot;unquestioning&quot; obedience on the other.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have wondered the same, but from the perspective of being involved in a <br/>
religion that is very much this way.  In fact, my dh and I have spent the <br/>
last 5 years indoctrinating ourselves and our children in this &quot;unquestioning <br/>
obedience,&quot; and now we are trying to struggle out from underneath what we see <br/>
as the debris.<br/>
<br/>
I have fought and fought with myself over this...Do I have to abandon my <br/>
religion, my faith or Do I have to abandon my strongly held values of <br/>
non-coercion and a child-centered style of educating?<br/>
<br/>
It is very, very difficult indeed, I think, to come to a feeling of peace <br/>
about it all.<br/>
<br/>
But, frankly, it is coming to me from a place that others might not consider <br/>
relevant, but I happen to...the very teachings of Jesus Christ.  I am making <br/>
a comprehensive self-study of those Biblical documents, trying to rely on my <br/>
own interpretations rather than those of experts.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m finding that the values I hold about raising children in a gentle <br/>
manner, letting them lead and trying to help them develop their own unique <br/>
talents is very much what the lessons of Jesus are all about.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I didn&#39;t write this to preach.   I mainly just wanted to affirm your <br/>
idea that there is a conflict here.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to hear the way other people have handled what I too think <br/>
is a conflict and like you said, hear from people who might not think it is a <br/>
conflict and why  they don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that I can&#39;t abandon my faith.  I  might at <br/>
some time abandon my &quot;organized religion&quot;... that lies in the future and I <br/>
cannot comprehend that right now. <br/>
 I have also come to the conclusion that I can&#39;t abandon my educational and <br/>
child-raising values.  They are too dearly who I am and who I believe I was <br/>
meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
So, right now, I choose to live with the dichotomy. <br/>
<br/>
And I continue to journey on...<br/>

<br/>
Very definitely.  Jesus was definitely an unschooler!  He taught while<br/>
walking along the road, lots of story-telling and answering questions as<br/>
they came.  He didn&#39;t ask the leading questions, people did and he answered<br/>
them.<br/>

&gt; I know this is a delayed reply for everyone --- apologies --- (I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; wading thru old posts from our 10 days out of town).<br/>
&gt; The posts on considering a no novel week are just to good not to add my<br/>
&gt; little story...<br/>
&gt; About two months ago,  I informed my dh that I would not be reading any<br/>
&gt; books for awhile (a month was my goal).  As we are constant readers,  he<br/>
&gt; thought I must be kidding (I wasn&#39;t).  I read a lot of non-fiction and some<br/>
&gt; fiction.  Anyway,  I have truly felt information overload on my mind.  I was<br/>
&gt; always &quot;book smart&quot;  (i.e., in advanced classes,  good memory,  good test<br/>
&gt; taker),  but find that I can neglect hands-on learning,  crafting.  For<br/>
&gt; example,  I could read all about sewing a Hallowen costume,  but to actually<br/>
&gt; do it,  I need to work with the materials, go to the store, etc.  Anyway,  I<br/>
&gt; am the kind that neglects the housework for a good book....and this seemed a<br/>
&gt; constant state.  I also have a tendency to *gorge* myself on books by<br/>
&gt; reading fast,  not savoring a book.<br/>
&gt;     So....I decided to give my mind a break from books to allow myself to<br/>
&gt; think in other ways and/or use the knowledge I&#39;ve read (I still allowed<br/>
&gt; e-mail reading - except on vacation!)<br/>
&gt;     Anyway,  I&#39;ve found it to have been a good experience...and I&#39;m trying<br/>
&gt; to figure a way to gently re-introduce some time for reading....to have it a<br/>
&gt; balanced part of my days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491735244">I know this is a delayed reply for everyone --- apologies --- (I&#39;m still<br/>
wading thru old posts from our 10 days out of town).<br/>
The posts on considering a no novel week are just to good not to add my<br/>
little story...<br/>
About two months ago,  I informed my dh that I would not be reading any<br/>
books for awhile (a month was my goal).  As we are constant readers,  he<br/>
thought I must be kidding (I wasn&#39;t).  I read a lot of non-fiction and some<br/>
fiction.  Anyway,  I have truly felt information overload on my mind.  I was<br/>
always &quot;book smart&quot;  (i.e., in advanced classes,  good memory,  good test<br/>
taker),  but find that I can neglect hands-on learning,  crafting.  For<br/>
example,  I could read all about sewing a Hallowen costume,  but to actually<br/>
do it,  I need to work with the materials, go to the store, etc.  Anyway,  I<br/>
am the kind that neglects the housework for a good book....and this seemed a<br/>
constant state.  I also have a tendency to *gorge* myself on books by<br/>
reading fast,  not savoring a book.<br/>
    So....I decided to give my mind a break from books to allow myself to<br/>
think in other ways and/or use the knowledge I&#39;ve read (I still allowed<br/>
e-mail reading - except on vacation!)<br/>
    Anyway,  I&#39;ve found it to have been a good experience...and I&#39;m trying<br/>
to figure a way to gently re-introduce some time for reading....to have it a<br/>
balanced part of my days.<br/>

&gt;&gt;i have a 13yo and a 14 yo and they just read all the time, im thinking of<br/>
&gt;having a<br/>
&gt;&gt;no novels week!! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh My!! I can&#39;t even immagine wanting to discourage reading! I am trying<br/>
&gt;with all of my might to encourage as much reading as I can around here,<br/>
&gt;public school kind of killed the joy of it for my children, by insisting </span></blockquote></div>
