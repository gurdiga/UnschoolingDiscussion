<div id="ygrps-yiv-336502774">First of all, I would like to say this will be my only post of the day <br/>
and don&#39;t plan to turn on the computer tomorrow.  I was almost afraid to <br/>
open my mail a few minutes ago.  I managed to click on &quot;compose&quot; before <br/>
I could see all the responses to last night&#39;s posts.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a <br/>
bit too sensitive and, even though I&#39;m already 42, still lacking the <br/>
strength and confidence I wish I had.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to apologize for my lack of clarity on the subject of <br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; to children who are causing a scene at Walmart (or <br/>
where-ever).  In my initial response to the original post I apparently <br/>
neglected to add that, in addition to saying &quot;no&quot; and, standing your <br/>
ground, you would, OF COURSE, explain why, be honest and respectful to <br/>
your children, and tell them &quot;I&#39;ll be able to afford it next week&quot;, or <br/>
something like that.  I honestly thought (especially since this is an <br/>
unschooling list and it is visited by unschoolers or parents who are <br/>
sensitive enough to even consider unschooling) that this would be <br/>
understood.  I obviously was very wrong and I apologize very much for <br/>
giving the wrong impression .  Believe me, I am not a cold and mean <br/>
person.  On the contrary, I am a very giving mother.  I cherish my boys <br/>
and will do anything to maintain their happiness, sense of security and <br/>
confidence and, of course, love of learning.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to allowing my boys to display unpleasant behavior at the <br/>
store because they are unhappy about something, I do not apologize.  <br/>
This is something that has worked for my boys and me.  This is really <br/>
something we hardly experience anymore because they are already 7 years <br/>
old.  But, on rare occasions, it does still happen, especially if <br/>
Leroy&#39;s blood sugar is too high or too low.  He is a Juvenile Diabetic.  <br/>
After exhausting all ways of trying to calm him which includes repeating <br/>
my explanations why he can&#39;t have something, explaining to him he will <br/>
surely get it another time, when we can afford it, giving him hugs, <br/>
etc.  - if all of this does not work, well, then, I let him express his <br/>
feelings.  I&#39;m very sorry if it inconveniences strangers, but as a <br/>
daughter of a very controlling and repressive mother, I believe in <br/>
allowing little children to express, in any way they wish, their <br/>
happiness, sadness,  or anger.  I know you don&#39;t all agree and I really <br/>
don&#39;t know anyone who feels the way I feel, but, from my own personal <br/>
experiences, this is how I honestly feel the situation should be handled.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are very sweet and loving boys.  They are very high-spirited and <br/>
happy.  Both have serious health issues and I believe their emotional <br/>
well-being is very important in keeping them physically healthy.  Paul <br/>
received a bone-marrow transplant in August 1999.  He was diagnosed with <br/>
a rare form of Leukemia and he had a very poor prognosis.  He has been <br/>
in remission for about 2 1/2 years.  We are very grateful to the doctors <br/>
at Texas Children&#39;s Hospital for saving our son&#39;s life.  Leroy&#39;s <br/>
diabetes is under very tight control so he is very healthy, otherwise.  <br/>
I would like to say that in addition to the doctors at TCH, my husband <br/>
and I take some of the credit for our boys&#39; good health today.  I firmly <br/>
believe that their emotional well-being is tied to their physical <br/>
well-being.  This is why I am so lenient with my boys.  I&#39;m sorry if <br/>
strangers are inconvenienced or annoyed at my boys, but my boys are more <br/>
important than they are.  That&#39;s how I truly feel.<br/>
<br/>
I think, on the whole, the public should have more patience with <br/>
children - especially here in Texas.  I&#39;m originally from Belgium and <br/>
very liberal Long Island, NY.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I have to say.  I&#39;m not going to turn on my computer until <br/>
Tuesday.  I&#39;m just protecting myself, that&#39;s all.  I am way too <br/>
sensitive and take things too personally.  I just hope I didn&#39;t make <br/>
anybody angry.  On Tuesday, I&#39;ll probably start lurking for a while and <br/>
after a few days will probably start posting again.  I should have <br/>
recovered by them.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, if I&#39;ve been rambling.<br/>

<br/>
Mailing lists like this are useful for ideas and for considering things that<br/>
we might not, otherwise, consider. They aren&#39;t intended for an emergency<br/>
personality surgery on you or me or anyone (though sometimes it does<br/>
happen).<br/>
<br/>
Take away from the posts what works and leave the rest. Clarify if you think<br/>
you were unclear or were misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
I try to look hardest at the posts that *really* irritate me, because<br/>
sometimes there&#39;s something there that I need to pay attention to.<br/>

<br/>
How could you think a single post could change our opinions of you. In my personal estimation your a great and generous friend to all of us on this list. You deserve many many thanks, from many people, looking for feed back and encouragement here. I admire your courage and the time you take to offer your ideas and experience. <br/>
<br/>
This is a difficult forum and it has taken me a long time to feel even a little bit comfortable offering my ideas or suggestions. When I first starting posting to groups like this I offended and bothered so many people but I&#39;m getting better. Interpreting posts, without actually knowing the poster, and obviously having difficulty recognizing humor or sarcasm, is an art in itself. <br/>
<br/>
I always look forward to reading groundhoggirl, you don&#39;t have to apologize for anything, just carry on with being a compassionate and respected member of this cyber society&lt;bg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Your Cyber Friend, Leslie<br/>
<br/>
ps, I&#39;ve always wanted to keep a journal but I don&#39;t. Lately I&#39;ve started a file to save some of my posts, much like a journal, and I&#39;m very excited about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148521364">I don&#39;t think you need to apologize... I thought we were just having a<br/>
discussion, and I&#39;m sorry if you felt attacked. On an email list, it&#39;s<br/>
hard sometimes because people don&#39;t necessarily have all the background<br/>
info on how you do things, and although to you it&#39;s obviosu that you<br/>
would never just say &quot;no&quot; and walk on, other people aren&#39;t sure... we&#39;re<br/>
all still getting to know each other. A lot of times, people suggest<br/>
stuff to me, and I think to myself, &quot;Well, but of course I tried that<br/>
already, it&#39;s obvious&quot; but they mean well, they just don&#39;t know me. And<br/>
sometimes something sems obvious to me so I don&#39;t suggest it, and that<br/>
turns out to be the poster&#39;s blind spot in the whole issue, the one thing<br/>
she never thought of...<br/>

attacks. That&#39;s how I, as a lurker there for a few days, interpreted it all.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing that I read that should cause you to believe you were way <br/>
out of bounds. No need to apologize. This list is for discussions. If we all <br/>
agree, all the time, there&#39;s no room for growth. So speak away. And listen <br/>
too. And grow. Always keep growing. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244853646">I apologize in advance because sometimes I forget that people take <br/>
responses to their posts as if they are written directly TO them, personally. <br/>
All comments I ever make are really to the &quot;idea&quot; - not necessarily to an <br/>
individual poster. I take what you may have posted and I just start thinking <br/>
about it and post about the subject - anything I say may not at all apply to <br/>
you and I may not even THINK it might apply to you. I just think that any <br/>
topic brought up in any post becomes fodder for exploration and delving into <br/>
more deeply. <br/>
<br/>
It is REALLY good to develop an &quot;if the shoe fits&quot; attitude about email <br/>
lists. If somebody posts something in response to your post, but you don&#39;t <br/>
think the shoe fits, then don&#39;t feel like you have to defend yourself - just <br/>
tell yourself, &quot;Woops, they think that shoe fits me, but I know it doesn&#39;t.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the opposite happens -- sometimes you&#39;ll read a post that is NOT <br/>
directed to you, but it&#39;ll sting or disturb you anyway because you DO fit <br/>
that particular shoe.<br/>
