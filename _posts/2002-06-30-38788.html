Thank you for the links.  We did find a church we loved in San Antonio when<br/>
we were there.  It was a UU church so technically it wasn&#39;t &quot;christian&quot; but<br/>
it was so down to earth and we enjoyed being there.  We attended a lecture<br/>
given by John Shelby Spong.  He wrote the book Christianity Must Change or<br/>
Die.  If you haven&#39;t read it, you might find it very interesting.  He refers<br/>
to people like us as &quot;believers in exile.&quot;<br/>

There is a common set of principles about humanity but it&#39;s a bring your own<br/>
god (or not) deal with any higher powers. So being called not Christian is<br/>
perfectly fine with UUs. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on the denomination. Mainline Protestants -- Episcopalians,<br/>
Methodists, Lutherans, UCC&#39;s, Presbyterians and so on -- don&#39;t make<br/>
distinctions in the mainline faiths on who is and isn&#39;t Christian. And as<br/>
far as I know the mainline Protestants were officially okay with the<br/>
Catholics being Christian ;-)<br/>
<br/>
At one time the Catholics were anti-Protestant but that rift&#39;s been<br/>
repaired. (Vatican II in the 60&#39;s maybe?) (Catholics have told me they<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to even enter a Protestant church as a kid.) In fact the<br/>
Catholics and Episcopalians are getting really chummy!<br/>
<br/>
Mormons do have an entirely separate book (or books?) of beliefs involving<br/>
another Prophet. From a mainline point of view it&#39;s hard to see very<br/>
significant additions to Christianity as Christian. But from a Mormon point<br/>
of view it&#39;s just Christianity plus ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For the fundamentalists it&#39;s about who is and isn&#39;t going to heaven and a<br/>
battle between God and the Devil. If you&#39;ve accepted Jesus Christ as your<br/>
personal Savior you&#39;re Christian and going to heaven. If you haven&#39;t, then<br/>
you aren&#39;t and are in need of saving. In practice it gets way more complex<br/>
than that because the Devil can be subtle and lead people down what appear<br/>
to be Christain paths which aren&#39;t really. So &quot;true&quot; Christians need to be<br/>
able to recognize true doctrine from false, eg, interpretting the Bible the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way, thinking the &quot;right&quot; way, behaving the &quot;right&quot; way. So in<br/>
theory for fundamentalists what church someone attends doesn&#39;t dictate<br/>
whether they&#39;re Christian or not. Their Christianity is in their personal<br/>
relationship with Jesus. In practice, in order to avoid being led astray and<br/>
avoid exposing children to false teachings, the requirements are a lot more<br/>
strict. So the fundamentalists are really just trying to protect people&#39;s<br/>
souls by pointing out who is and isn&#39;t Christian. Sort of the Consumer<br/>
Reports of the True Christian faith ;-) (I&#39;m teasing partly but not totally.<br/>
And if I&#39;m off a bit, others will help by clarifying!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702282792">The original poster was asking about religious sects that do<br/>
not view others as part of their religion.  I think that<br/>
Hasidic Jews do not claim that other Jews are not Jewish.<br/>
They do believe that Judaism is matrilineal (so someone born<br/>
to a Jewish man and a not Jewish woman would not be<br/>
considered a Jew by them) and they do not validate<br/>
non-Orthodox conversions to Judaism.  So they would argue<br/>
that Jews by choice converted by a Reform rabbi (for<br/>
example) are not Jewish.  These are points of Jewish law in<br/>
their eyes.  But in my experience, they do not view Jews who<br/>
are less observant than they are, or follow other traditions<br/>
as not being Jews.  Sorry if that was too many negatives in<br/>
a sentence :-)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, a Hasidic Jew may (or may not) think they are<br/>
practicing true Judaism and look down their noses at less<br/>
observant Jews,  but they view the &quot;who is Jewish&quot; according<br/>
to their interpretation of Jewish law (Halacha).  And if you<br/>
are born to a Jewish mother, you are Jewish (again in their<br/>
view).  Other branches of Judaism do, for example, say that<br/>
you are a Jew through the father&#39;s line as well.  Anyway,<br/>
that is my understanding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964356845">**I think that Hasidic Jews do not claim that other Jews are not Jewish...<br/>
<br/>
So they would argue that Jews by choice converted by a Reform rabbi (for <br/>
example) are not Jewish.  These are points of Jewish law in their eyes.  But <br/>
in my experience, they do not view Jews who are less observant than they are, <br/>
or follow other traditions<br/>
as not being Jews.  **<br/>
<br/>
**In any case, a Hasidic Jew may (or may not) think they are practicing true <br/>
Judaism and look down their noses at less observant Jews,  but they view the <br/>
&quot;who is Jewish&quot; according to their interpretation of Jewish law (Halacha).**<br/>
<br/>
Which is no different from &quot;who is Christian&quot; thinking. It isn&#39;t about <br/>
&quot;following other traditions&quot; or level of observance - it&#39;s about how they <br/>
interpret the scripture. <br/>
