<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046957652">**I have a friend who likes the idea of unschooling but worries that <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;not smart enough&quot;. She said that &quot;smart&quot; people know how to <br/>
answer their children&#39;s questions on the spot and know enough in their <br/>
own heads to point stuff out without planning ahead of time. I do see <br/>
that she has a point. Your child asks you what kind of insect is <br/>
crawling on a rock and you immediately tell her the name of the bug <br/>
and a really interesting fact versus telling her you will look it up <br/>
with her later, and either you forget to look it up or when you do, <br/>
she has lost interest.**<br/>
<br/>
I think that parents who can answer ALL their children&#39;s questions on the <br/>
spot would be horrible unschooling parents. What&#39;s to think and wonder and <br/>
ponder about if mom knows everything? The big secret about knowledge is that <br/>
no one has it all, but everyone can share in any parts of it if they want to. <br/>
And that (most) people love to share the knowledge they hold.<br/>
<br/>
Much more important than &quot;knowing the answers&quot; is a willingness to help a ch<br/>
ild find the people with the knowledge they&#39;re seeking - through books or <br/>
vidoes or tapes or in person. <br/>

<br/>
Oh no!  I&#39;ve ruined my children!!<br/>
<br/>
(Oh wait, I forgot I didn&#39;t know everything...<br/>
But lots of times I just do know the answer, and I just tell them, but I try <br/>
to go on to the next question they might or might not be thinking of, and tie <br/>
it to something else they&#39;re interested in, so they have either loose ends or <br/>
new bridges.)<br/>

<br/>
Or other people!  I often say &quot;I think it&#39;s this, but <br/>
Jeff/Cathyn/Wendy/Dad/Mike/Anne knows more about it,&quot; and the next time that <br/>
person&#39;s over, I recount up to the point where we are.  Instead of making <br/>
them start from scratch, I&#39;ll say in front of the kid who asked, &quot;Marty asked <br/>
about circuits, and I said X, but I&#39;m not sure if I was right,&quot; and they can <br/>
take over from there.  It&#39;s quicker, less boring, and less imposition on them.<br/>
