<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334223332">Recently (well always, but recently) three or four members have  <br/>
complained to me on the side about the list.  I send them the list  <br/>
description, but by then they feel unwelcome because they aren&#39;t  <br/>
really unschooling (or not yet), or they&#39;re &quot;Waldorf inspired&quot; or  <br/>
whatever.  One complaint was that I wasn&#39;t letting local questions  <br/>
through (&quot;Who lives near me?&quot; or &quot;How to I do this&#39;n&#39;such in West  <br/>
Virginia?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are a few issues.  If I sent a newcomers welcome (and I  <br/>
might; I don&#39;t remember), people tend to ignore those.  I usually  <br/>
ignore them myself, these days, when I join groups, because they&#39;re  <br/>
usually the default yahoo message.<br/>
<br/>
People can join this group without going through the front entrance,  <br/>
by using a subscribe e-mail, and they can do that from the front page  <br/>
of my site.  So it&#39;s not like there&#39;s the required reading of the  <br/>
intro and a test.<br/>

<br/>
Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning  <br/>
All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made  <br/>

This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not  <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play  <br/>
way.) It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure  <br/>
unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion�there are  <br/>
hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to  <br/>
focus more toward how people learn no matter where in the world they  <br/>
are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901151078">I like it the way it is. I do like the idea of having you include local links on your website or something. There has been talk recently about where people are from and I include my city under my name most of the time. I came to this list because our local unschoolers list seemed to be trying to be so inclusive that it had lost the principles of unschooling and had become radical unschooling unfriendly. I had never considered myself a real unschooler until I realized that I had way more in common with the radical unschoolers than with anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
As you said in a previous email, you can&#39;t be responsible for people feeling welcome. I like the way you are trying to stay true to principles. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If people put where they are from in their sig line, then others can<br/>
correspond privately.  I don&#39;t see that issue being a problem.  I like<br/>
the international aspect of this list and focusing on state issues seems<br/>
too much.  I don&#39;t have a problem with discussing international<br/>
differences, that&#39;s interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
I like that the list is specific to unschooling.  If someone is checking<br/>
out unschooling then they should get a taste of what it really is, not<br/>
some watered down version of it.  If they don&#39;t like unschooling, then<br/>
maybe another site would be better for them.  If they decide that<br/>
unschooling interests them, then this is a great place to stay and learn<br/>
more!<br/>
<br/>
I even like that this is a place to discuss John Holt, even though a lot<br/>
of people don&#39;t, or maybe even haven&#39;t read anything he&#39;s written.  It<br/>
seems a lot of folks that unschool, come from other avenues, and that&#39;s<br/>
cool, but unschooling does have a history in John Holt and that&#39;s worth<br/>
knowing more about and discussing.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878646412">Two friends and I have started a local unschooler&#39;s group, and even though we spent hours <br/>
crafting a vision statement, intro letter and description to make it clear that the intent of our <br/>
group was about exploring unschooling, it didn&#39;t really matter. <br/>
<br/>
We even used the phrase, &quot;When we leave the curriculum and the school discussions <br/>
behind....&quot;  That didn&#39;t do the trick either--the discussion on our list seems to be centered <br/>
around charter schools, curriculum, classes, and how unschooling means whatever works for <br/>
the family.  I&#39;m learning that people are often going to think what they think--or sometimes <br/>
choose not to think!!  (O.k., I&#39;m a little frustrated right now!--lol)<br/>
<br/>
I think the only way people will figure out how this list works is to have their experience with <br/>
it and figure it out.  Although, come to think of it, you could add a line right on the front <br/>
page encouraging people to read for a bit before they post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659903076">Ok.  There&#39;s also the new Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network.  Anyone who joins<br/>
can post their location.  I did.  Anyone who is interested in local stuff<br/>
can hook up with people from their state or region on that network and ask<br/>
questions about local stuff.  Radical unschoolers are very eager to share<br/>
ideas, to help others gain what they can from unschooling philosophy and to<br/>
meetup with others in their local area.<br/>
<br/>
So.  I think the list description and the function of the list works very<br/>
well (and has for a number of years).  It&#39;s very successful at what it<br/>
does.  But there&#39;s a problem with doing networking stuff on a yahoo list.<br/>
The problem is that while the content is made to be archived and is<br/>
searchable, when at any point in time someone reads old posts requesting<br/>
local information, the information is either outdated or people who once<br/>
wrote are not as easy to reach as the moment they posted something.  Getting<br/>
new responses is spotty because many people read messages on the web instead<br/>
of having posts delivered to their inbox and many many people aren&#39;t online<br/>
a lot either.  And to an extent this is a problem no matter what the format.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m for keeping the list as is and referring elsewhere for networking and up<br/>
to date local info purposes.<br/>

I think the description on the home page is clear enough for arguments like  <br/>
these. The list is largely about ideas and thoughts and in a lesser way, <br/>
problem  solving, not individuals and &quot;making sure everyone feels comfortable&quot;. I <br/>
think  working to make sure folks aren&#39;t offended dilutes the process of <br/>
discussion,  personally. Discussions on this list (and Unschooling Discussion) have <br/>
sometimes  taken me aback or made me uncomfortable but have *always* helped me <br/>
to think  more clearly, examine myself and those &quot;mindless thoughts&quot; more <br/>
closely. More  than any other list.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;One complaint was that I wasn&#39;t letting local questions   <br/>
through (&quot;Who lives near me?&quot; or &quot;How to I do this&#39;n&#39;such in West   <br/>
Virginia?&quot;).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Maybe for this, set up something in the &quot;Links&quot; or &quot;Database&quot; section where  <br/>
folks can put in different groups, contacts, Yahoo groups for things local. I  <br/>
think there used to be something like this on Unschooling Discussion before <br/>
it  moved to Google Groups? Folks could even put in their own e-mail address if <br/>
they  were willing to discuss details and the finer points of regulations in <br/>
their  area. Just a thought.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I always check the home page of any group I join, so that I  know <br/>
what I&#39;m getting into, how to post and what is accepted and not so welcome.  <br/>
That&#39;s what I think the description of the group is for. Even if I go in  the <br/>
&quot;back door&quot; way, I always go to the front and &quot;check out the neighborhood&quot;.  <br/>
Personally, I almost always do this *before* I join.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I think the description is fine.<br/>

Sandra<br/>
------------------------------------------------------<br/>
It may make you feel like a bad guy but I don&#39;t think it makes you seem like a bad guy. I think that you have great intellectual integrity. (I love my spell check so that I can write things like that.) I really like that you moderate and call people on things. That is why I am really liking this list. I want to be called on my thinking and expression in a supportive, nonjudgmental manner. <br/>
<br/>
After the discussion about attentive parenting, I have been thinking that having an attentive parent and having choice is what really lets our kids grow and learn. For this list, you act as the attentive parent and we all have choice in reading and replying. You may sometimes feel like you are being a bad guy but I think that happens when one is an attentive parent. You aren&#39;t rude or controlling and are a great role model for me in the way you communicate. <br/>
<br/>
I think that many of us are used to controlling parents who aren&#39;t attentive, and are trying to not treat our kids the way we were treated. If people get defensive, it isn&#39;t your problem and you shouldn&#39;t take it personally. But if you do, that is something that we all feel at times, and you are still a role model in how you handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mom,<br/>

There&#39;s an amazing sense of urgency in the messages on your lists that I<br/>
truly appreciate; the shift to &quot;HERE, HERE, we&#39;re all Always Learning --<br/>

attached to whatever they&#39;re doing and calling it &quot;unschooling.&quot; The most of<br/>
us here could attest to that, I&#39;m sure. If we&#39;re still here, we&#39;ll also<br/>
attest to that being the best discomfort ever. So thanks for that part of<br/>
you, the part you&#39;ve dubbed *the bad guy* when you&#39;re actually the kick-a$$<br/>
good guy. Like the master in Kill Bill... he kicked Uma&#39;s ass and in the<br/>

<br/>
My assumption is always that no one is going to read all of any  <br/>
description. Even if they do they aren&#39;t going to absorb all of it.  <br/>
(I vaguely remember a study that said patients only picked up a third  <br/>
of the instructions from doctors. And that&#39;s for information they  <br/>
wanted to remember.)<br/>
<br/>
The first phrase is what they&#39;ll use as a foundation to build from.  <br/>
While the idea you&#39;re getting at is clear from an experienced  <br/>
unschoolers&#39; view point, I don&#39;t think it creates the right  <br/>
foundation for most people.<br/>
<br/>
What would a list that starts &quot;Discussion for communist fans of Karl  <br/>
Marx&quot; be about?<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest problems of describing lists like this is the  <br/>
words don&#39;t mean what we wish they did. Discussion list doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
discussion list to lots of people. It means place to come chit chat  <br/>
with others about what you do. (The first word my thesaurus gives me  <br/>
for discussion is &quot;conversation&quot;.) Unschooling means whatever someone  <br/>
decides it means for their family.<br/>
<br/>
Examination of ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Analysis of ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Are those too scary? Maybe it *should* be scary for the people who  <br/>
think examination and analysis are scary. They&#39;ll know to stay away.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;List for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling and  <br/>
attentive parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not it though. Though examination goes on, it&#39;s more about  <br/>
living the life for people who&#39;ve already done the examining.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;List for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling and  <br/>
attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based on  <br/>
those principles.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe too wordy but I tend to do that. ;-) Maybe it can&#39;t be  <br/>
described in one sentence and needs several to capture each of the  <br/>
aspects.<br/>

as this list is (and others), there is a lot of really interesting <br/>
observations and ideas he has about children and the way they learn.  <br/>
It&#39;s from a different perspective than being a parent living with your <br/>
kids.  I found my first John Holt book on a free shelf in the library.  <br/>
I had read him already by checking out one of his books from the <br/>
library and when I saw another book on the free shelf, it was like <br/>
finding gold!  It was a long time ago and I haven&#39;t read anything of <br/>
his in a while.  I have 3 of his books here and only purchased one of <br/>
them &quot;Learning All the Time&quot;.  If you really want to read John Holt, <br/>
I&#39;m sure you can do it without putting up any $$.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel this way too.  I believe I&#39;ve joined and left this list several <br/>
times starting in 2006.  Each time I rejoined, I was in a little bit <br/>
different place in unschooling.  I have been offended many times on <br/>
this list, even to the point of tears.  Then after thinking about it <br/>
for a while, I realized it was because I was facing something that <br/>
needed to be addressed.  I can honestly say that I&#39;ve grown more as a <br/>
person, parent and unschooler due to the discussions on this list than <br/>
on any other list I&#39;ve been on.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the list description is clear.  I also believe that new <br/>
unschoolers aren&#39;t really comprehending what this list is really like <br/>
because of their expectations and their preconceived notions of <br/>
unschoolers.  They are coming onto this list expecting something in <br/>
particular and I don&#39;t think the words in the description are going to <br/>
matter.<br/>

No, because usually just quoting the list description to them shows  <br/>
they hadn&#39;t even read it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe my question isn&#39;t even valid. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe it should be &quot;what  <br/>
should I do about people not reading the list description and then  <br/>
being all tacky to me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I guess the answer is quote them the list description as they&#39;re  <br/>
leaving and tell them to think about reading intro pages the next  <br/>
time they join a list.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s a need in some people, to be pampered and spoon fed,  <br/>
but I only want to do that for my kids, my husband when  he&#39;s sick  <br/>
and friends in the hospital.  I don&#39;t have the personality of a  <br/>
nurse, and if I did, this list might turn into a sick ward of people  <br/>
who wanted to discuss themselves instead of unschooling, and then all  <br/>
the brilliant and thoughtful people who help make it so wonderful  <br/>
here would wander off.<br/>

Well that&#39;s true!<br/>
<br/>
(Don&#39;t forget libraries--you could borrow Holt books.)<br/>
<br/>
I was hugely inspired by the John Holt stuff I read when I was in  <br/>
college, and then it had a whole new level of meaning when Kirby  <br/>
seemed like a guy who would not fit into school very well.  And by  <br/>
then, Teach Your Own was published.  Pretty exciting for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But things are different now for people who come to unschooling.   <br/>
John Holt died before their kids were even born (mine too; Kirby was  <br/>
born in 1986 and Holt died in 1985).  Soon there will be unschooling  <br/>
moms who were born after Holt died.<br/>
<br/>
Now the inspirations are more likely to be the young adults who never  <br/>
went to school.  I don&#39;t want to cut John Holt mentions out entirely,  <br/>

who brought it up a while back... Don&#39;t really remember what context,<br/>
but I had acquired a new Holt book here and so it was fresh reading and<br/>
fresh in my head.  Every time I read one of his books, I gain new<br/>
information that directly applies to unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, don&#39;t cut out John Holt!  I agree about coming so far so fast.  I<br/>
heard about John Holt when I first started homeschooling when Chamille<br/>
was 5.  If I hadn&#39;t been aware of John Holt and how he coined<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, I really believe it would&#39;ve been years later that I<br/>
would&#39;ve really gotten to unschooling.  His ideas about how kids learn<br/>
really hit home for me.  I came to the attentive parenting aspect of<br/>
unschooling slower and later.  It&#39;s not that I was an unattentive<br/>
parent, it&#39;s just that Chamille was an easy child.  When Margaux came<br/>
along I was already into unschooling and had to relearn how to be<br/>
attentive and patient because of the kind of kid she was/is.  Chamille<br/>
benefitted from that change in my parenting too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like I had the unschooling down, and then grew into all the other<br/>
aspects that make unschooling work well.  I&#39;m more analytical, so while<br/>
attentive parenting makes perfect sense to me, it&#39;s not hugely<br/>
analytical like discussing child psychology and how schools really mess<br/>
kids up.</div>

I also think people often just read the first paragraph or two and jump in. The first two paragraphs are clear and succinct as to what this group is about.

This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling <br/>
and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based <br/>
on the principles underlying unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning will focus more toward how people learn no matter <br/>
where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any <br/>
particular country or jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.)<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I can honestly say that I&#39;ve grown more as a person, parent and <br/>
unschooler due to the discussions on this list than on any other list <br/>
I&#39;ve been on.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068131916">-=-This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative.  <br/>
(Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to- <br/>
play way.  New members&#39; posts are moderated, and it&#39;s good to read  <br/>
several dozen posts before jumping in.)  -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think if someone goes into the archives or reads the recent posts  <br/>
they can catch up well, so I went by posts instead of days.<br/>
