<div id="ygrps-yiv-190807371">I have contemplated creating a blog just to chronicle my search for a good cup of coffee in Kansas City... just not happening.

<br/>
I also carry Fioricet for mihgraines and take them whenever my head starts to hurt - I&#39;d rather treat something that would have gone away by itself than risk a full-blown migraine - and I encourage my daughter to take pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine for a stuffy nose or allergy symptoms (and I take them myself). When I was a kid, the medicine cabinet was sacrosanct, but Rain knows what to take for various things and does so... she reads labels more carefully than I do, and there&#39;s never been a problem... and this has been going on for years.<br/>

My husband Gary is allergic to alcohol, so we avoid nyquil (or any medicine containing alcohol) and he&#39;s not had a drink of alcohol since his teens, when he discovered wine caused a reaction.  In his case, it results in asthma-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, his throat swells and he feels nauseous.  He also has the same allergic reaction to bananas (tho he can eat banana muffins/bread) and all melons.  I suspect it&#39;s something to do with the molds or fermentation process.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537157107">My personal cure for most illness is Celestial<br/>
Seasonings Lemon Zinger Tea (NFI) and Matlock (also<br/>
NFI).  With enough cable/satellite channels, you can<br/>
watch Matlock for at least 8 hours straight.  I have<br/>
always found that I am eager to get back to life after<br/>
a Matlock marathon :)<br/>

When allergies get to Ellis, I give him OTC<br/>
Benadryl-like stuff at about 1/2 the recommended<br/>
dosage.  Relieves his symptoms but doesn&#39;t make him<br/>
foggy so he can still enjoy his day!<br/>

whatever he can imagine (as long as I use a mix!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895181512">With medication for ills, as with most stuff, we&#39;re firmly in <br/>
the &quot;whatever works, works&quot; camp. We&#39;ve all found some OTC stuff <br/>
that works on some things and some homeopathics (and mixed remedies <br/>
which are sort of frowned on by some) that work for other things. <br/>
The Chestal cough stuff (the kid kind in a honey base) is just <br/>
wonderful - we all like it. I know many homepathic remedies would be <br/>
difficult for some since they often (generally?) have an alcohol <br/>
base. DS (Just turned 7) know which stuff he wants, and when and how <br/>
much he should take. He is probably the last one to take anything <br/>
since his preferred remedy for most anything is chicken noodle soup <br/>
and a long nap in our bed with the remote handy if he wants to watch <br/>
TV. I was quite happy to find the homeopathic head cold blend remedy <br/>
because most medications (even plain old Tylenol) tend to make me <br/>
sleepy - even the non-drowsy stuff! (Of course, more than 2 cups of <br/>
anything caffeinated will do the same thing or one strong glass of <br/>
wine). So, to find something that clears the symptoms AND allows me <br/>
to not burn all my sick days at work is a wonderful thing. DH, <br/>
however, he&#39;ll pretty much just &quot;tough it out&quot; until either he can&#39;t <br/>
take it anymore OR until *I* can&#39;t take him being sick anymore and <br/>
twist his arm (when he&#39;s on his 4th or 5th day of moaning and <br/>
groaning I admit I can be a pest!).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209023697">We live in Central Oregon and Peet&#39;s hasn&#39;t come here yet, but they are in<br/>
Portland and maybe other areas on the west side of the mountains.  My<br/>
favorite is the Decaf Special Blend.  We have an espresso maker that my dh<br/>
inherited from his company and I never really liked the coffee it made until<br/>
I tried Peet&#39;s.  It converted me from a morning tea drinker to a morning<br/>
coffee drinker.  I still take my tea in the afternoon though!  <br/>
<br/>
There was just an article in our paper this morning about Peet&#39;s as compared<br/>
to Starbucks and how it&#39;s a much (!) smaller company.  Peet&#39;s also gets a<br/>
much higher percentage of their revenue from selling beans vs. Starbuck&#39;s<br/>
which gets the majority from selling drinks in the store.  <br/>
