<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180852833">Hi all -<br/>
I&#39;d like to include the following blurb in a letter to the editor....is it <br/>
accurate?  I haven&#39;t read the book but am kinda steamed about a recent <br/>
article in the newspaper describing &#39;pupil personnel workers&#39; as &#39;unsung <br/>
heroes&#39; because they work so hard to keep kids in school using the &#39;carrots <br/>
and sticks&#39; approach....(i.e., threatening a parent with legal action bec. <br/>
her daughter is spending time with a dying relative and missing a lot of <br/>
school).....<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you agree or disagree with the following statement:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Re: the article about &quot;unsung heroes&quot; (Feb. 11, 2002), I would like to <br/>
propose that anyone interested in dropping out of school and dropping into a <br/>
meaningful life consider reading the book &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by <br/>
Grace Llewellyn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do agree with it. But I don&#39;t think it will have a great deal of impact.<br/>
First, you&#39;re attacking people who are working hard at what they believe in.<br/>
They may be guilty of harming kids by keeping them in school, but their<br/>
crime is one of ignorance rather than malice.<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful to leave the impression that you feel that keeping kids<br/>
in school is *an* option -- even if you don&#39;t believe it -- but that for<br/>
some kids there might be something better. Once that seed of more options is<br/>
planted in their heads, then it can grow into the new option being a better<br/>
option ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Another book (which I haven&#39;t read) but was recommended in the Chinaberry<br/>
catalog is The Teenager&#39;s Guide To School Outside the Box by Rebecca Greene.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chinaberry.com/showbook.cfm?invnum=9241&userid=98296622)">http://www.chinaberry.com/showbook.cfm?invnum=9241&userid=98296622)</a><br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1575420872/qid=1013518505/sr=8-1/ref">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1575420872/qid=1013518505/sr=8-1/ref</a><br/>

<br/>
Outside the Box sounds like suggestions to do in addition to school or<br/>
instead of school rather than the Teen Lib book that seems to advocate<br/>
dumping school to find yourself. (A bit radical for those who are certain<br/>
school is the best thing kids can do for themselves and dropping out is<br/>
barely better than suicide.) I think it would be helpful for counselors to<br/>
know about both but the Outside the Box book might pave the way for the more<br/>
radical Teen Lib book.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Joyce.  That book is hard to find, too, so the impact would <br/>
fizzle.<br/>
<br/>
And most teens CAN&#39;T drop out of school, so putting the germ of an idea they <br/>
can&#39;t pursue out there seems cruel.  <br/>
<br/>
I think suggesting that school isn&#39;t the inevitable behemoth it once was is <br/>
worth doing, though.  There&#39;s a new exit to homeschooling, it&#39;s just not <br/>
marked with a big lit sign yet.<br/>
