Hi, Grace --<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of people unschool because they feel that the level of<br/>
bullying that it would take to get their particular kids to do<br/>
curriculum requires them to be meaner than they are willing to be.<br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer: I do have friends who are able to entice their children to<br/>
do some curriculum willingly.  I am not saying that all curriculum users<br/>
are mean.  However, overcoming *resistance* in children is likely to<br/>
take either pressure or trickery.  I don&#39;t want to use either.) <br/>
(Although I&#39;ll cop to some occasional trickiness. ;-)    ) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557877273">I&#39;ve been a member here for about 6 months now, think unschooling makes a lot of sense, but am still personally uncomfortable with the idea of actually doing it - uncomfortable with the comments I&#39;d get from family/friends and just a huge, scary, &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work?&quot; thought keeps popping in my head.<br/>
 <br/>
Fortunatley, my son is just 14 months, so I don&#39;t have to make a decision right away.<br/>
 <br/>
In doing a little research on local schools, I found that there is a Sudbury school about 4 blocks from me.  I like the sense of community available - I feel like we&#39;d be so alone/sheltered if it was just Rory and I.  I like that I can say he&#39;s going to school to anyone who asks.  I like that it&#39;s based on unschooling principles and ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
But if he&#39;s going to school, I guess it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve read so many interesting discussions and ideas here and would love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts on Sudbury schools - opposed to regualr schooling and opposed to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
When my oldest was little I asked other moms I knew how they got their kids <br/>
to get medicine.  They said &quot;I put it in a spoon and say &#39;here!&#39; and he drinks <br/>
it,&quot; or something.  Kirby would not, could not, take any medicine in any form.<br/>
<br/>
Years later, I looked back and wondered why I tried to make him.<br/>
<br/>
But basically it was just the way he was.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to google.com and put in some subset of these terms: <br/>
 homeschooling discipline schoolwork work task consequences  <br/>
you&#39;ll get lots of discussion of how some of the more serious homeschoolers <br/>
make their kids do their work.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve read about myself has involved such things as loss of privileges, <br/>
grounding, withholding food, shaming (private and public), spankings, and the <br/>
threat of school or of Christian boarding schools.   Some can&#39;t threaten school <br/>
because they don&#39;t believe in it.  Some threaten hellfire and damnation.   <br/>
<br/>
There are kids told to do their work because God wants them to.<br/>
<br/>
I never did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979517042">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking allot about this. Brianna simply didn&#39;t react well to sit and learn type of stuff. So I guess we came to unschooling by default. Now, she&#39;s saying that she isn&#39;t learning anything. I&#39;m re-reading the Handbook....I&#39;m trying to let her lead. <br/>
For the last few days she&#39;s been working in her math workbooks an doing word searches. Due to circumstances beyond our control (her bio-mom threatened court action if I didn&#39;t drop Brianna off to &quot;help with the girls&quot;) - we haven&#39;t been reading Harry Potter - or anything at night. We&#39;ve been talking.<br/>
I believe in unschooling.<br/>
I believe that my doubts are because of me and my baggage more than Brianna&#39;s.<br/>
