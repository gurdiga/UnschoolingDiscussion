<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248424782">This is a busy and helpful list!<br/>
I am new to it - though unschooling  is not new to me [ever since I read<br/>
Ivan Illich in my middle years]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to share a resource - maybe you all know it but I hope that<br/>
is ok too.<br/>
Choosebooks.com is a web site....good values since you deal directly with<br/>
the booksellers and the company does not add a markup as on other sites. <br/>
What struck me is the Specialists page and the fact that they have a<br/>
frequent buyer club if you want to join it.<br/>
 Blows my mind...too see all the categories under &quot;find Specialists.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020885489">Hi, Elissa,<br/>
<br/>
No, I do not own Choosebooks.com  [maybe I should-grin]  but I do think<br/>
it is a breath of fresh air among book sites.<br/>
I do have  asmall out of print book business , homebased, and i have<br/>
watched/participated in what the <br/>
big companies are doing. Most people do not realize, for example,  that<br/>
they are often paying more on half.com or amazon or B&N, than what they<br/>
would on one of the smaller book sites.  <br/>
<br/>
What I like about choosebooks.com is the  providing free info  to people<br/>
and I am still amazed at the number of specialists they list.   I thought<br/>
folks on this list might be interested too. Most book sellers have only<br/>
half their invenotry on line so they often have books in stock that<br/>
people are looking for - if you know who to ask you can  often find a<br/>
book.  I suggested that a customer look there for a cook book he wanted<br/>
at Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that you found it on another list. Do you remember which one?<br/>
 Curious.<br/>
