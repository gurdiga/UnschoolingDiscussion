<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564436970">After a recent mention on this list about the book Dumbing Us Down,<br/>
I went and bought it(I&#39;ve heard of it b4 over the last 5+ years).<br/>
I started to read it, so did dh.  It didn&#39;t catch our attention at<br/>
all.  Dh said he could finish it maybe, but we both feel like it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;preaching to the choir&quot;.  I&#39;ve felt this way about too many non <br/>
fiction books re: home/unschooling over the years.  I even bought<br/>
the book Unschooling: Using the whole wide world as your classroom.<br/>
(I think that&#39;s the name).......and I never read it!  Is it possible<br/>
to get enough non-fiction reading off the net(like this list and <br/>
unschooling.com)?  Otherwise.....I wonder what my problem is with <br/>
buying these  books and not being able to get into the groove of<br/>
reading them.  Thoughts.....anyone? krista</div>

 <br/>
I think so.<br/>
 <br/>
But those books can be good for people who don&#39;t/won&#39;t/haven&#39;t done the  <br/>
&quot;live&quot; reading of message boards and lists.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
 <br/>
I just told a friend by e-mail this morning that I can&#39;t stand to watch Dr.  <br/>
Phil because I get no rebuttal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m reading a John Holt book, Escape from Childhood, that I hadn&#39;t read but  <br/>
that Deb Lewis is reading and mentioning, so I got a copy.<br/>
 <br/>
I want to say, &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; <br/>
But... he&#39;s dead. &lt;g&gt;  And the book is really old.<br/>
 <br/>
My complaint is just that he&#39;s talking about the modern family&#39;s  &quot;invention&quot; <br/>
and using the word &quot;invent&quot; over and over about the nuclear  family.  <br/>
&quot;Invent&quot; implies a person decided, and foisted it on all  others.  It developed.<br/>
 <br/>
But he&#39;s also citing some bad 70&#39;s social history by a feminist author  who <br/>
did some very minimal &quot;research&quot; to justify a point (about women going to  work <br/>
and leaving children with others).   So it bothers me because  it&#39;s SO deeply <br/>
early-70&#39;s, in that way.  In the next two decades, European  history started <br/>
to really shift from military and political history to  honest-to-god social <br/>
history, of how people lived and what they ate and wore and  sang and thought.  <br/>
 <br/>
It doesn&#39;t really change the value of his points, it just brings his  <br/>
justification into question.  A minor problem, 30 years old and the  author&#39;s gone.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s some time travel. &lt;g&gt;  (Maybe this isn&#39;t the discussion  where time <br/>
travel is; sorry if not.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982634986">Sometimes these lists are more beneficial because you get to see how people<br/>
think when they redefine their ideas through conversation and discuss things<br/>
that are really happening in their lives and how they deal with it.  I tend<br/>
to read more non-fiction than fiction as a rule but in the last 10 years<br/>
I&#39;ve read even less fiction because I get my fill of it reading to my kids.<br/>
It might not be the fiction I would choose for myself, but I need something<br/>
more meaty to read after spending hours reading fiction to the kids.<br/>

I haven&#39;t read the unschooling book you mentioned, but I&#39;ve had what I could<br/>
get from the library. I&#39;ve found that most home/unschooling books are aimed<br/>
at beginners and they don&#39;t have much that&#39;s new to me. Even many books that<br/>
say they&#39;re about unschooling, seem to emphasise &quot;educational&quot; activities,<br/>
and don&#39;t have a &quot;whole life&quot; approach.<br/>
<br/>
I get much more from other unschoolers&#39; personal experience and knowledge. I<br/>
suspect that there is far far more to read about unschooling on the net than<br/>
all the books put together. Especially radical unschooling.<br/>

By far.<br/>

I read the magazines, or try to, but it&#39;s more and more of the same  beginner <br/>
articles so often, and the exchanges here are more current, more  lively, <br/>
funnier, sadder, more electric.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849782689">Yes, that&#39;s how I feel too....like I&#39;ve already heard<br/>
it from all the wonderful unschoolers who have shared<br/>
their lives online over the years, and I have also formed<br/>
opinions from dh and my own experiences w/education(including<br/>
the whopping 4 days our son spent in K).  So, the books I buy<br/>
and try just get set aside.  I&#39;ll quit buying now, I may be<br/>
able to finally set aside the guilt of not having read the books, ;0)<br/>

I found out about unschooling online.  I&#39;ve never read<br/>
a single whole book by Holt, or Gatto or who&#39;s the<br/>
other guy?  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always *really* liked books and reading, so it&#39;s<br/>
strange that I wouldn&#39;t grab all the books that have<br/>
anything to do with unschooling and devour them all,<br/>
ain&#39;t it? lol <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read snippets, and quotes, and articles, and I<br/>
recently found Gatto&#39;s Underground of Education<br/>
online, and have read some of that.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;d much rather discuss and read online, and<br/>
interact with other people but mostly, just sit here<br/>
and think about it all, lol. <br/>
<br/>
And I know if I wanted to know what Holt had to say<br/>
about his, or Gatto about that, someone online would<br/>
know, and tell me. :-) <br/>
