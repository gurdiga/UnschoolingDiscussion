 </span></blockquote>Thanks Brenda!  I didn&#39;t have to wait a month! I just told her that today<br/>
she could choose what she wanted to do and if I could help her at all let me<br/>
know.  She was a little suspicous at first and even asked if this included<br/>
not doing math.  So I got busy doing something and I see that she is typing<br/>
furiously at the computer.  After a while I casually walk over to see what&#39;s<br/>
up and she is on the sixth page of a movie script!!  And it was pretty good<br/>
too....several characters and neat story line.  PLUS she can type a heck of<br/>
a lot faster than I can. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And I took the little guy to the library and just followed him around.  He<br/>
skipped the kid section and found encylopedia type picture books on<br/>
freshwater fish.  He just had to get those!  And some Magic School Bus<br/>
videos.<br/>
So I guess there is something to this unschooling stuff! &lt;bwg&gt;  I am so<br/>
thankful for all your posts and encouragement.  I&#39;ll be reading!...<br/>
