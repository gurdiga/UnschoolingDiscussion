need to not have a record.<br/>

I thought Canada had small establishments in public where people could<br/>
actually go and smoke pot without being bothered. Is that not true or am I<br/>
just wishful thinking?!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, I do indeed know the difference between decriminalization ( a ticket ) <br/>
and illegal  (getting a record or prison sentence).  Many activists see <br/>
decriminalization as the first step to legalization.  The American Justice Department <br/>
isn&#39;t very happy, btw, with the movements in Canada toward decriminalization <br/>
for that very reason.  <br/>
