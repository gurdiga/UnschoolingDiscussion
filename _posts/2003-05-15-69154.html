<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418786754">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I am new here too. And it is interesting to me that I had a similar <br/>
notion to what Kimberly&#39;s advice was.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately thought, Give him a micro cassette recorder! Do the <br/>
reporter game as K. suggested,  this way but he won&#39;t have to write <br/>
and keep up with what is said. He is assured of catching it all on <br/>
tape. He can ask *all* the questions he wants later. Of course, <br/>
you&#39;ll have to ask people is they mind being recorded.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ALSO*** Why was the last half of my digest (#3490) written entirely <br/>
in the Greek (or similar) alphabet!!?!<br/>
<br/>
Strange.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

If I&#39;m having a conversation with someone else (adult or not) and my child <br/>
NEEDS me, I will put that conversation on hold and deal with that child.   <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m having a conversation with someone else and my child isn&#39;t a part of <br/>
that conversation, I will find him or her something else to do.  Or maybe she <br/>
can listen quietly, but getting into the conversation is no more okay than if <br/>
one of my kids tried to have a conversation with someone else (child or not) <br/>
and I kept butting in with distracting questions or comments.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom is unwilling to have conversations without her child being an active <br/>
and equal participant, she might not have many people to talk to before long.<br/>
<br/>
And I would NOT be interested in having my discussions tape recorded for <br/>
later replay just because a mom was unwilling to have a private conversation <br/>
with me.  If I liked the kid, I&#39;d help him be part of the conversation.  If I <br/>
didn&#39;t want him to be part of the conversation and the mom was clueless, <br/>
there probably wouldn&#39;t BE a conversation, or not at the calm and thoughtful <br/>
level she might have preferred.<br/>
<br/>
I give my kids space, and because of that DIRECTLY, it seems, they&#39;re quite <br/>
willing to do the same for me and for each other, and others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608071779">As we&#39;re speaking of conversation and interrupting;<br/>
Our problem is different.....but a major annoyance<br/>
<br/>
The problem we have here - our neighbor upstairs has Aspergers - he&#39;s a text book case!<br/>
He interrupts constantly - really.<br/>
This morning, my aged aunt was outside talking w/ me;<br/>
Our upstairs neighbor was leaving for work.<br/>
My A.A. (Aged Aunt) was speaking; he walked up and said to Brianna - who had her arm around my AA - &quot;where are you going to powwow this weekend?&quot;<br/>
Brianna started to speak.<br/>
My AA immediately stopped speaking.<br/>
<br/>
That happens so often.<br/>
He&#39;s been at our powwow tent - and walked up to me while a customer was speaking - as soon as there&#39;s any pause - like someone asked a question and someone else hasn&#39;t actually started to speak - he talks.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna doesn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
Should she answer him?<br/>
If we ignore him. he repeats and repeats and gets louder.<br/>
<br/>
This man is very high functioning and he&#39;s 43.<br/>
<br/>
There are others who do that - &#39;cross conversing&quot; or &quot;cross interrupting&quot; ...gads ....I hate it!<br/>
It is rude and annoying,<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Janis<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664094973">I find that adults interrupt pretty often when my 6yo is talking.  What I do<br/>
is to maintain eye contact with her, and hold up my finger in a &#39;one minute&#39;<br/>
gesture to the interrupter, ignoring anything they say until my daughter is<br/>
done talking.  When she&#39;s done I immediately turn to the person and ask what<br/>
they&#39;d like to say.  I don&#39;t know if that would work in your situation, but<br/>
maybe after a few times he&#39;d get it? ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308944096">I also agree with this.<br/>
<br/>
When two other adults are having a conversation, I don&#39;t interrupt their conversation to ask what they are talking about.  That would be considered inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I think children also need to learn that its inappropriate for them to involve themselves in a conversation that they were not originally part of, unless they are invited.<br/>

He can save his questions for later if he&#39;s there, listening.  <br/>

take shape ... My kids are receptive to my explanation of *diana time*, that <br/>
I need to do things (i.e. private conversations, an evening without them) to <br/>
be sure that *diana* is nurtured just as I nurture them by being *mommy* ~ <br/>
and yes, I know mommy IS diana and diana IS mommy ~ the dominance needs to <br/>
change occasionally.  They understand because they are aware of the oh so <br/>
subtle shift between being Hannah/Hayden and being Mommy&#39;s child.  <br/>
I have no doubt that the child in the original post can understand mommy&#39;s <br/>
need to be herself and have her own friends ... <br/>
