I doesn&#39;t bother me. For me, it&#39;s just another word. I get bothered when <br/>
words of any kind are used to hurt though. So &quot;You&#39;re an idiot!&quot; would <br/>
bother me more than &quot;What the f**k?&quot; coming out of anyone&#39;s mouth. I know <br/>
I&#39;m usually in a minority on this one. Lots of people get bothered by the <br/>

Gosh, that&#39;s how I feel about it too :) How do you (the universal you) feel <br/>
about your kids using it (or other such words for that matter)? For us, if <br/>
they us the words *in context* and not as a slur, or insult, then we&#39;re <br/>

swear words anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All use of derogatory terms (no matter the the actual word) used in<br/>
hateful and mean ways bothers me.  However, what bothers me more is the<br/>
thought that there is a double standard on women or men saying the word<br/>
in question.  I am very surprised to see all hateful words used so<br/>
freely by PEOPLE.  I am not, however, bothered by these words being used<br/>
in a discussion tone or when a situation deems them appropriate (where a<br/>
person is deliberately trying to be mean and hateful).<br/>

it, as long as it&#39;s not in front of the little ones. The little ones hear <br/>
some in movies and know it&#39;s not something they use. If they hear the word <br/>
shit from anyone, which is mostly daddy, they make him pay a dollar. Not <br/>
sure where this came from, maybe something on TV. I would feel uncomfortable <br/>
hearing my 6 year old use the word shit or anything else without saying it <br/>
was a word she heard or asked what it meant. But for the 6 and 7 year olds <br/>
to actually talk that way right now, would make me feel uneasy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I cuss. I used to make a concentrated effort to not do that in front of the <br/>
kids, but it was a hard habit to break. I finally decided that I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
make a big deal of it, now I rarely cuss, but it happens. &lt;g&gt; I think because <br/>
I don&#39;t make a fuss over it, my kids see it as no big deal and as such they <br/>
don&#39;t cuss too much either. Although the other day, Moly dropped a heavy book <br/>
on her foot, tripped over it, fell and hit her elbow on the side of the <br/>
coffee table. She said f*** very loudly and began to cry. Darin called out <br/>
from the computer room and asked if she was okay, and then said &quot;Did she just <br/>
say what I though she said!&quot; Jack said, &quot;Yeah Dad, Moly said f***!&quot; The <br/>
windows were open, and my little brother was just about to walk in the house. <br/>
I heard him on the porch laughing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

That&#39;s very cute :) I think you&#39;re right, that making a big deal out of the <br/>
words make them more attractive. We don&#39;t have an issue with them, and that <br/>
seems to have led to rare occasions of hearing the kids use cuss words :)<br/>

Our kids are 6 & 9. They don&#39;t use cuss words very often, but when they do, <br/>
it&#39;s *always* in context, so it&#39;s no big deal to us :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  So &quot;You&#39;re an idiot!&quot; would <br/>
bother me more than &quot;What the f**k?&quot; coming out of anyone&#39;s mouth. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
And in my life thusfar, those who objected to &quot;fuck&quot; spoken aloud in the air <br/>
were the very ones most likely to tell someone he was an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
I would be more angry if one of my kids called someone a fucking idiot than <br/>
just an idiot, that&#39;s true.  But they know words hurt and they&#39;re surprised <br/>
when they hang out with other people who just constantly berate or tease or <br/>
insult people.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Kirby brought some older gaming-friends over, because the shop <br/>
closed and their game wasn&#39;t done.  So of five people who came over, I knew <br/>
one and had met three, and there was one new guy altogether.<br/>
<br/>
After a while they and my other two kids went outside to play boffers.  It <br/>
became a team melee thing, in the vacant lot.  Holly told me later that the <br/>
new guy (I&#39;ll call him &quot;Rob,&quot; because that&#39;s his name) was not nice.  She <br/>
said he had told her and Marty, &quot;I&#39;ll get the fat guy and you get the ugly <br/>
one.&quot; or something like that.   <br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Holly, it would be okay if you told him that that wasn&#39;t nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I did!  I said &#39;That&#39;s not nice.&#39; and he said it was nicer than he <br/>
USUALLY was and I said it still was not nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said he would probably remember that for the rest of his life, that a ten <br/>
year old girl was brave enough to tell him he wasn&#39;t being nice.  And I said <br/>
I bet he was nicer after that.  She said he was.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned later to Marty that Holly said he wasn&#39;t nice, and Marty said <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s not.  He never is.&quot;  I told him Holly was brave enough to say so.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned it to Kirby and told him Holly had said that.  Kirby said &quot;good!&quot; <br/>
and agreed that he&#39;s not a nice guy.<br/>
<br/>
That story had nothing to do with the f word after all...<br/>
