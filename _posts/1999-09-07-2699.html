<div id="ygrps-yiv-38065948">Here are some sites that those of you who are into the role<br/>
playing/renaissance may fine interesting, if you don&#39;t already have them. I<br/>
think I got some off this list in the first place.  Thought I would post<br/>
them since there was a discussion on the subject. I would be interested in<br/>
learning more about the Middle Earth roll playing, I am a big Tolkien fan<br/>
from way back.<br/>
