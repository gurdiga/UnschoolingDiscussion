 </span></blockquote>Flowing there is one thing -- but I think that people are reacting to feeling <br/>
FORCED there on every possible occasion. The list HAS flowed there many many <br/>
times and will again, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;To say that this list won&#39;t be willing to talk about how terrible <br/>
 </span></blockquote>schools are and discuss all the things we need to do politically to <br/>
take the power away from them is fine.  The list owners have the <br/>
right to make their list whatever they want and after this, I&#39;ll let <br/>
it go.  But if they are unwilling to discuss it, this list isn&#39;t <br/>
really for all those considering unschooling, it&#39;s for those who have <br/>
already come to terms with the terribleness of school and the <br/>
rightness of unschooling and are ready to discuss day to day.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Discussing the problems with doing school-type stuff at home is definitely <br/>
going to have to happen here, as you said, for the list to be useful to <br/>
people just considering breaking away from school. But that isn&#39;t the same as <br/>
discussing school-related politics and economics. That is about how kids <br/>
learn (or don&#39;t).<br/>

&lt;&lt; Shakespeare&#39;s plays can be raunchy or scary or sad or funny and I think <br/>
they <br/>
are delightful --- but they can also be VERY VERY boring to read.<br/>

can&#39;t understand a play until I&#39;ve seen it on it&#39;s feet, then read it, then <br/>
seen it or worked on it some more.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t forget the recent movie version of A Midsummer&#39;s Night Dream with <br/>
Stanley Tucci as Puck.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That one&#39;s good, but there&#39;s a British version that came out around the same <br/>
time that&#39;s even better. Wilder.<br/>

Hey, Paula --<br/>
<br/>
I think my son is too young, and my budget too lean for live theater. <br/>
But I&#39;ve been wanting to get more plays on video.  My son has watched<br/>
some Shakespeare and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead with avid<br/>
interest.  I&#39;m thinking he can handle some pretty complicated ideas if<br/>
he gets to take them in on the comfort of his couch.  Do you want to<br/>
recommend anything?  (The rest of you are welcome to chime in.)<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m getting my husband Steambath on video for Christmas. <br/>
Irreverance really appeals to him.  (Definitely explains why he married me.)<br/>
