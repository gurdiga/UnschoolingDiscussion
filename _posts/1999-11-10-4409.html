<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411258027">This is a poem I first heard when I was living in Germany (1981-1983).  I&#39;ve<br/>
always enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
John Andersen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Man in the Glass<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;ve got all you want in your struggle for pelf<br/>
<br/>
And the world makes you king for a day,<br/>
<br/>
Just go to a mirror and look at yourself<br/>
<br/>
And see what that man has to say.<br/>
<br/>
For it isn&#39;t your father or mother or wife<br/>
<br/>
Whose judgment upon you must pass;<br/>
<br/>
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br/>
<br/>
Is the one staring back from the glass.<br/>
<br/>
You may be like Jack Horner and chisel a plum<br/>
<br/>
And think you&#39;re a wonderful guy,<br/>
<br/>
But the man in the looking glass says you&#39;re only a bum<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t look him straight in the eye.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the fellow to please, never mind all the rest<br/>
<br/>
For he&#39;s with you right up to the end;<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;ve passed your most dangerous and difficult test<br/>
<br/>
If the man in the glass is your friend.<br/>
<br/>
You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years<br/>
<br/>
And get pats on the back as you pass.<br/>
<br/>
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve cheated the man in the glass.<br/>
