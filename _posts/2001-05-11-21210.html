<div id="ygrps-yiv-80427632">Yeah, here in WA we show all of the ones that offer discounts our &quot;notice<br/>
of intent <br/>
to homeschool&quot; form that we have to ifll out each year ...<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion if they won&#39;t take that ... take them a pile of your childs<br/>
work<br/>
and some of your records you keep etc ... tell em that all I got if it<br/>
don&#39;t work<br/>
what else do you want?  If they are in your area ... they should know you<br/>
don&#39;t have to file forms... also could ask an association in your area, see<br/>
<br/>
what they suggest.. they are usually up on that stuff (or other co-op<br/>
mommies?)<br/>
<br/>
That WOULD be frustrating!<br/>
============<br/>
No, I don&#39;t have anything like that. In Mo. we don&#39;t have to file any<br/>
forms stating we are homeschooling. I am tempted to print something up on<br/>
the <br/>
computer, with my husband as the principal and present that to them. <br/>
I could easily make a letterhead. How does that sound?<br/>

===============================<br/>

Just wondering, Judie - instead of squirting it up there<br/>
how bout squirt it on HIM so I can get some sleep LOL<br/>
<br/>
Mom speaks highly of vinegar - she uses it as a disinfectant<br/>
I put bleach in my dishwater if doing them by hand and we have<br/>
any buggies runnin thru the house (colds etc) but (sigh)<br/>
I normally just run them thru the dishwasher (bowing head<br/>
in shame in the presence of women who homeschool AND <br/>
have time to wash dishes heheeh)<br/>
===========<br/>
Hot water only kills germs if it&#39;s at least 160 degrees, which is too<br/>
hot for you to put your hands in.  Also, vinegar and lemon juice<br/>
work to kill germs because anything below a pH of three<br/>
extinguishes all life.  It works great as a contraceptive too....squirt<br/>
some lemon juice in there, and you will not get pregnant.<br/>
Judie<br/>
================================<br/>
***<br/>
Just a note on this one.<br/>
My son went thru a phase of this<br/>
He had been trained and then started messing his pants in bed<br/>
I took him to the doc, wondering what on earth ... doc said it happens<br/>
a lot ... esp in boys and should end right away on its own, if not to <br/>
bring him back in ...<br/>
<br/>
Then my lil guy told me he had a secret one day ... so we went thru<br/>
the &quot;mommy is the one to tell secrets to&quot; thingy and he finally confided<br/>
in me and told me when he had to go &quot;poop&quot; he would go and lay down<br/>
and go to sleep so he didnt have to go anymore because it had hurt<br/>
last time he had done it ...<br/>
<br/>
When I talked to doc about it he said this is very common if kids<br/>
for some reason have a hard bowel movement in their pants or in <br/>
the toilet it scares them thinking it will always hurt ... so they stop<br/>
<br/>
What I tried and it worked with him, was I told him I would go in<br/>
with him when he had to go and be there and that I promised him<br/>
it would not hurt (then I gave him juices to be sure I kept my<br/>
promise LOL and once he got past that initial fear he was fine <br/>
and we never had messy pants again ...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I had a neighbor whose son used to hold his bowel movements<br/>
from fear and it caused damage inside ... he now will mess his pants<br/>
(at 11) and not even know he has to go - awake or asleep - how horrifying!<br/>
Her doc said it is because he held it so much it damaged internally and<br/>
they need to do surgery at 12 if it doesn&#39;t correct itself by then :(<br/>
Poor lil guy ...<br/>
<br/>
So .. having said all that,  I wouldn&#39;t sweat it - as they say it happens<br/>
alot but you might encourage it or help it with some things that loosen<br/>
the bowel and encourage him to try with you there so he has nothing<br/>
to fear?<br/>
<br/>
AND if it is fear because he is afraid of sititng on the potty, maybe that<br/>
big hole<br/>
of water is scary? They have games real cheap you put on toilet ... you aim<br/>
and <br/>
shoot rofl<br/>
<br/>
OR <br/>
they have a gold game you sit on the toilet and putt while waiting for &quot;it&quot;<br/>
to happen - may take his mind off what is below him?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought but you may have already tried that. - I wish you the best<br/>
with it ... <br/>
<br/>
Nice part is - they train themself in time ... as they age and come to care<br/>
about stuff <br/>
they work it out ...  Just remind him it doesnt make him bad, but you want<br/>
to help him<br/>
to grow up in this way and he can help you by telling you how you can help<br/>
...?<br/>

 Now we just have to get over his resistance to<br/>
 pooping in the potty, which he has yet to do.  He says<br/>
 he is scared.<br/>
