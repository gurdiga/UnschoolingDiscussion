This just came kind of out of the blue, and it wasn&#39;t until I was forwarding <br/>
it to someone else that I noticed the &quot;unschooling&quot; listed under Christian <br/>
requirements.  That&#39;s a first for me, in Bible literalism.<br/>
<br/>
The page she had come across is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>

I have just read the &#39;no spanking&#39; page.  I disagree.  We are Christians so<br/>
<br/>
we base our whole lives on the bible, including no birth control,<br/>
<br/>
unschooling etc. As far as I am concerned spanking is NOT WRONG because the<br/>
<br/>
bible says: spare the rod and spoil the child.  There are only two things<br/>
<br/>
that our 6 children ever get/got spanked for and that is deliberate/defiant<br/>
<br/>
disobedience and disrespect (age appropriate).  Our older three - 16; 13; 11<br/>
<br/>
have not been spanked for a long time as they know we mean it from the few<br/>
<br/>
spankings they got between 6 and 9 years. They aren&#39;t smacked for their<br/>
<br/>
childish mischieviousness or accidents or learning mistakes. I will stick<br/>
<br/>
with what is biblical (ie guaranteed to work). Our kids are exceptionally<br/>
<br/>
confident and happy and also very helpful and respectful to other people and<br/>
<br/>
their property.  Used correctly as intended by God, there is nothing wrong<br/>
<br/>
with spanking.<br/>

Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in what you wrote was anything new to me.  I was raised Southern <br/>
Baptist and have heard all that and worse.<br/>
<br/>
Do what you want to do, but it does help families to know they have options.<br/>

Thankyou for your reply. I don&#39;t know if your reference to &#39;Southern<br/>
Baptist&#39; has a special meaning as I live in Australia.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope that those people do put in all the extra hard work those<br/>
options are going to require.  There are at least a hundred<br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers here in Canberra and unfortunately the families I<br/>
have met who opt for those kind of theories have had the worst children I<br/>
have ever come across, (because they don&#39;t bother with putting in the EXTRA<br/>
work).  I know that smacking has been abused and used wrongly for years and<br/>
that is definitely not okay, but so far going to the other extreme, and<br/>
throwing the baby out with the bath water, seems to be producing the same if<br/>
not worse results - judging by the current generation of teens and<br/>
pre-teens.<br/>
<br/>
I wish all of you the very best and pray that people really can make those<br/>
options work if that&#39;s how they really want to go.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;bible says: spare the rod and spoil the child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t using the rod spoiling the child? Maybe the bible is directing us to<br/>
spare our rods so that we can spoil the child, in a positive way. Maybe this<br/>
statement was incorrectly written in its interpretation and it originally<br/>
said &quot;put down that rod or you are going to spoil that child!&quot; That&#39;s the<br/>
problem with always referring our thinking to the bible, the interpretations<br/>
are endless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Used correctly as intended by God, there is nothing wrong<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;with spanking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Case in point. Used correctly by God, war is justified. Used correctly by<br/>
God, incest is appropriate. Anyone can justify anything they do by<br/>
abdicating their good senses to someone&#39;s interpretation of what God would<br/>
want. We know what&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I just hope that those people do put in all the extra hard work those<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;options (not spanking) are going to require.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it takes good thinking, creativity, compassion, love, and work not to<br/>
spank children. It would be much easier (in theory) to just whack a child<br/>
when she isn&#39;t doing what is wanted. Easier and completely wrong.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The statement &quot;the worst children I have ever come across&quot; is telling. Does<br/>
this mean that the children didn&#39;t blindly and obediently do what they were<br/>
told right away? Does this mean that the children were independent thinkers<br/>
who knew what they wanted? Does this mean that the children were articulate<br/>
about what they thought? That can be pretty daunting to an adult who thinks<br/>
they should be in control.<br/>

That was my wonder at the same point.   <br/>
&quot;Worst&quot; meaning having fun? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&quot;Worst&quot; meaning they&#39;re getting to balance on the curb while her kids are <br/>
holding her hand and walking right beside her?<br/>
<br/>
Hard to guess, but I&#39;ve been around people who&#39;ve declared bored/boring kids <br/>
&quot;good&quot; and interested/interesting kids &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>

claim they don&#39;t) but seem to be completely inept, inconsistent, poor role<br/>
model human beings and have children who consistently show a lack of social<br/>
respect. These parents are usually &quot;naggers&quot;. (&quot;Jimmy, don&#39;t pull on that<br/>
cat. JIMMY! Jimmy, I&#39;m going to count. Jimmy, the kitty doesn&#39;t like that.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I figure these are often what are held up to us as the example of the<br/>
&quot;Unspanked&quot; by those who want to continue to justify hitting their kids. &quot;If<br/>
I don&#39;t, they&#39;ll turn out to be like THOSE&quot; seems to be the argument.<br/>
<br/>
When people meet my daughters and find that there is no such thing as<br/>
punishment in our house, spanking included, they either can&#39;t believe it or<br/>
they immediately proclaim that my daughters are just &quot;naturally&quot; that way<br/>
and that THEIR children are much, much different temperamentally.<br/>
<br/>
Some people just don&#39;t have any DESIRE to treat their children with respect.<br/>
It&#39;s sad and bewildering.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

inheritable trait.   Whether it&#39;s nature or nurture, if the parents&#39; social skills <br/>
are lame, what chance does the kid have?<br/>
<br/>
I used to count down from three, with Marty.  It was a mystery what would <br/>
happen if I got to zero.  No, I guess what happened was I went and picked him up <br/>
and moved him where I needed him to go. But I only remember a couple of times. <br/>
  It was a kind of &quot;really&quot; and &quot;last chance&quot; when I was trying to get him to <br/>
be elsewhere or otherwise, when he was three or so.<br/>
<br/>
What worked better was for me to change my own uptight, stubborn vision of <br/>
what they should do and how fast.   <br/>

Yeah, I didn&#39;t write back to the woman, and she&#39;s in Australia so it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter, but I think anyone who thought as she did and who was around my kids <br/>
for any length of time might change ideas.   <br/>

I think my social skills are lame - which is probably why I have never posted <br/>
before!  But I really really want to unschool and I want to interact with my <br/>
kids the way I see posted on this list. So my question is, can any of you <br/>
recommend good books or other resources that will increase my interpersonal <br/>
skills?  Just reading here has helped in lots of ways that I am with my kids but I <br/>
am thinking the biggest problem is truly that lack of people skills on my part. <br/>

<br/>
The book &quot;Straight Talk&quot; by Sherod Miller, Daniel Wackman, Elam Nunnally,<br/>
and Carol Saline is great. It really breaks down communication into pieces,<br/>
and is used in seminars for increasing meaning and accuracy in our<br/>
communication. It&#39;s a &quot;how to&quot; book that is very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
 We also liked Faber and Mazlish&#39;s &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot;, which is a<br/>
great family communication book as well.</div>
