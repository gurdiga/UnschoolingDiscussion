 Wonderful post, Ren!<br/>
 I love all your ideas. They&#39;re so inspirational!<br/>
 Hey, I think YOU should be speaking at the conference, too.<br/>
 I always get a lot out of things you say.<br/>
 I love your unschooling spirit - it&#39;s contagious! :o)<br/>

Wow...thanks Karin.<br/>
I do enjoy public speaking and am currently checking into holding a &quot;natural <br/>
learning&quot; seminar at the local health food store.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a lot of extra time with a wee babsy man around, but maybe when <br/>
the kids are older.<br/>
That was  very sweet, I get a lot out of your posts also.<br/>
Ren</div>
