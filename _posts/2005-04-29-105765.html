<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390320584">As Susan frequently mentions, there should be a spew alert on this!  I <br/>
seldom laugh ou loud, but this had me ROTFLOL.  I already notced UU might <br/>
not be good when Susan suggested Unconditional Unschoolers (although I like <br/>
it).  I&#39;m just looking a the initials - the PUs got me laughing, then <br/>
thoughts of being mistaken for the other EU - plus I don&#39;t need to be <br/>
reminded of my weight &lt;G&gt;.  And CU -well this reminds me of a recent <br/>
exchange on our bathroom blackboard:<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I live in Scottsdale and there are some homeschool groups but the big <br/>
&gt;&gt; ones<br/>
&gt; are mainly religious and not the unschooling type.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Arizona is very good for homeschoolers. No tests, no intrusions. All you<br/>
&gt; have to do is register with the Superindentent of Education and they send<br/>
&gt; you lots of good info.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Joanne.  :-)  I&#39;ve heard that Scottsdale is a bit more conservative<br/>
&gt; than Phoenix and that may be why so many  more religious hs groups. <br/>
&gt; Better<br/>
&gt; climate though, I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, it&#39;s great to know it&#39;s pretty easy to hs there.  I hate the idea of<br/>
&gt; testing.  It&#39;s important for me to live in a &quot;low regualation&quot; state.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Not doing school at home can&#39;t do that. It *can* make learning fun and<br/>
&gt;&gt; enjoyable---but the other parts of life are still lacking *something*<br/>
&gt;&gt; when chores are expected and bedtimes are enforced and food is<br/>
&gt;&gt; restricted and the child&#39;s time is not really his own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has been the most exciting, fascinating, sometimes scarey, thing to<br/>
&gt; behold how unschooling has gone in our family from simply meaning &quot;not<br/>
&gt; doing school&quot; to encompassing the other areas of our lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Each time I have ever thought, &quot;have we gone too far? is this too<br/>
&gt; much?&quot; and yet waited for the kids to show me we have indeed pushed<br/>
&gt; ourselves over the final line, they prove to me we have yet another<br/>
&gt; step to go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is like addition.  We can always add one more step to the journey.<br/>
&gt; Or maybe subtraction.  We can always take away one more obstacle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First it was just school.  Then it was food controls and tv/video<br/>
&gt; games limits.  Then it was bedtimes, and chores and clothing and music<br/>
&gt; and movie ratings.  Then it was friendships and dating, and who knows<br/>
&gt; what the next step will be?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s so cool to see this unfold, and not just see it but participate<br/>
&gt; in it as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The discussions on this list and others have definitely helped when I<br/>
&gt; was struggling in one area or another.  Thanks, everyone!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Are you guys sure this is going to work???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to drive you all crazy I just know it!  Okay, I think it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; been at least 2 weeks (I hope it&#39;s been that long)that I posted here<br/>
&gt; and got some great advice - the main thing being to just say school<br/>
&gt; is done for the year, no more me asking her every day what she wants<br/>
&gt; to do, filling her backpack with things to do while I work - to just<br/>
&gt; back off!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since then, my daughter has LIVED on the computer, she discovered a<br/>
&gt; new game and the normal routine is for her to stay up until 2am,<br/>
&gt; watch Roseanne until 3am, read a little bit  and probably fall asleep<br/>
&gt; by 4am or so.  She&#39;ll sleep in until anywhere between 2-3pm in the<br/>
&gt; afternoon when all her friends get home from school then she&#39;s on the<br/>
&gt; phone and playing this new game on the computer.  We are talking 11<br/>
&gt; hours on the computer most days.  This new schedule has stopped her<br/>
&gt; going to chorus at school, she missed the last two art classes<br/>
&gt; through our homeschool co-op which she liked going to but today was<br/>
&gt; the last one and she didn&#39;t want to get up for it. I&#39;m going to work<br/>
&gt; for a couple of hours in the morning which is okay I guess although<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s a little nervous about staying home alone so if she was awake<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d be nervous. I also know this new schedule makes it impossible<br/>
&gt; for me to keep certain scheduled appointments so I&#39;m having to cancel<br/>
&gt; appointments and reschedule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her cousins are coming to stay with us for 8 weeks this summer and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to be able to take everyone to the park, beach, library<br/>
&gt; etc... but I&#39;m afraid that if I don&#39;t limit her computer time, she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; not be starting her day until 3pm in the afternoon and her two<br/>
&gt; cousins will have been waiting around all day for her - she&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; easy to wake up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This just seems like she&#39;s living a total seperate life than everyone<br/>
&gt; else.  She expressed an interest in a few 4H projects and earning the<br/>
&gt; Girl Scout Silver Award so we bought several books etc... for these<br/>
&gt; two things and she did a little until I backed off and now she&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; on the computer.  I haven&#39;t mentioned them but I&#39;ve got the 4H leader<br/>
&gt; and people in our girl scout troop wanting her to come work with them<br/>
&gt; on different things and now she doesn&#39;t seem interested anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I&#39;m a bad parent, I am just having serious doubts that she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; get tired of the computer and want to do anything else.  We&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt; problems for 2 years with her &quot;obsession&quot; with the computer - this<br/>
&gt; caused a lot of problems when she was in school and had homework to<br/>
&gt; do.....I&#39;m trying to look at it as the computer is her passion and<br/>
&gt; who knows where that could lead and she&#39;s been saying she wants to<br/>
&gt; create computer security systems for banks - that&#39;s great but how is<br/>
&gt; playing this game related to that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; AHHHHHH!!!!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Tracie<br/>
&gt; And I&#39;m guessing that for those two years you argued, limited,<br/>
&gt; bargained, etc &quot;can&#39;t use the computer until you get your<br/>
&gt; schoolwork/chores/whatever done...&quot; Now she&#39;s got the freedom to<br/>
&gt; indulge herself at will. Ever had anyone tell you you *can&#39;t* have<br/>
&gt; something (M&Ms, cookies, a bubble bath, whatever) until...? And you<br/>
&gt; spent all that time thinking about it most likely and counting<br/>
&gt; minutes until you could... And you counted and grabbed those M&Ms as<br/>
&gt; quickly and as many as you could manage before they were again<br/>
&gt; restricted. Same thing she&#39;s doing right now. And it&#39;s only been a<br/>
&gt; short time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Flip side is that there may be things that cannot be rescheduled<br/>
&gt; without cost or pain. That&#39;s when you two sit down and figure out a<br/>
&gt; compromise - you need her to be able to get up in the morning, she<br/>
&gt; wants to play this game and whatall, is she willing to be home by<br/>
&gt; herself (if she&#39;s old enough), all that stuff. Talk it out- LOTS of<br/>
&gt; talk. If there&#39;s one big common denominator I&#39;ve seen in all<br/>
&gt; unschooling households is lots of TALK, for fun, for information,<br/>
&gt; for connection, for arriving at compromise to keep the *family*<br/>
&gt; running relatively smoothly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the &quot;other people&quot;, again, sit down and discuss with her<br/>
&gt; freely, not to &#39;get&#39; her to do these things but rather &quot;These people<br/>
&gt; are waiting on you for this. Do we need to tell them it&#39;s on hold<br/>
&gt; for now?&quot; (not worded well but you get the gist).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cousin-wise, get her involved in the planning for their visit - she<br/>
&gt; might use the Internet to find interesting things to do for the time<br/>
&gt; they are in town, for example. Have her type up and print out a<br/>
&gt; list. USE her computer skills to make things fun for all. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; possible that by the time they arrive (if they&#39;re in school they<br/>
&gt; likely won&#39;t be there for at least a month from now or longer), she<br/>
&gt; might have eaten her fill on this game and be willing to ease back<br/>
&gt; some.<br/>

&gt; Hey move to Connecticut! LOL We don&#39;t even file notice and we&#39;re not<br/>
&gt; any kind of school (not even private school); there are unschoolers<br/>
&gt; and relaxed eclectic types and inclusive/secular support groups; and<br/>
&gt; we rarely ever have a tornado - there was one that touched down about<br/>
&gt; 2 years ago, didn&#39;t even really register as an F1! We do however have<br/>
&gt; the occasional blizzard or hurricane.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the feedback regarding TCS/NCP and its relationship to or<br/>
&gt; with unschooling.  I&#39;m not replying to anyone&#39;s individual response<br/>
&gt; here, just to the conversation as a whole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hear you.  But, while I&#39;ve seen some of what you describe in<br/>
&gt; TCS/NCP circles, the criticisms I&#39;m hearing also remind me a lot the<br/>
&gt; ones you hear about unschooling!  You know, those who take issue with<br/>
&gt; Sandra&#39;s &quot;posting style&quot; and those who interpret the concept of RU as<br/>
&gt; turning unschooling into &quot;unparenting&quot;.  I guess part of me feels<br/>
&gt; like I have these two really good friends that I love dearly, but<br/>
&gt; that don&#39;t get along, LOL.  It isn&#39;t causing a problem for either of<br/>
&gt; them, but it bugs me! (and, I mean this in a mild and lighthearted<br/>
&gt; way)  It mystifies me because I see so much good in each of them, and<br/>
&gt; in my eyes they are so alike and ought to be great friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My interest in TCS/NCP is what led me to unschooling.  And, in my<br/>
&gt; view the discussions I read in radical unschooling forums are quite<br/>
&gt; simply the practical application of NCP.  Ah well....I don&#39;t know who<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to sell on this, LOL....I&#39;ll just continue to take the<br/>
&gt; good I get from each and be thankful to all!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Carolyn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. Just saw Dar&#39;s posts about her experiences with TCS,<br/>
&gt; whew...feeling a little less alone in my perceptions :-)<br/>

&gt; I like Pam&#39;s &quot;Whole Life Unschoolers.&quot;  Earlier today I was writing and <br/>
&gt; used<br/>
&gt; the words &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;total&quot; unschoolers to try and get the same <br/>
&gt; meaning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can see how &quot;radical&quot; was used in the past to differentiate from <br/>
&gt; &quot;partial<br/>
&gt; unschoolers,&quot; but I think of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; as being inclusive of <br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; aspects of life.   I think that&#39;s b/c of Susan and Stephanie&#39;s<br/>
&gt; RadChristianUnschoolers list and their list description.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is an interesting discussion for me, since I&#39;d not heard much about <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; alphabet soup you&#39;ve been describing&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because school has infected our thinking and our society so pervasively, <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; might be that true unschooling would include complete family lifestyle<br/>
&gt; changes.  I don&#39;t believe that parents (other than Skinner?) used job and<br/>
&gt; reward charts before they became popular in schools.  Having arbitrarily <br/>
&gt; set<br/>
&gt; bedtimes may also be a result of the &quot;get up early for school, you need <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; rest&quot;  influence.  Even the idea of how and when people eat <br/>
&gt; (alone/together)<br/>
&gt; differs in different cultures and here may be part of the controlling<br/>
&gt; doctrine spilling over from schools to home.<br/>
&gt; Just some random thoughts about it all.<br/>

&gt; It never bothers me to apologize myself when I clearly really AM sorry <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; one of my kids was having a melt-down, or said something he shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; said,  or my husband cuts someone off with a grocery cart (he&#39;s not seeing <br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; well in  one peripheral direction anymore after eye surgery) and if I <br/>
&gt; really AM<br/>
&gt; sorry,  I&#39;m saying, &quot;Ooops, sorry&quot; for my own reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m sorry my daughter got cranky and cried.&quot;  When she does that I AM <br/>
&gt; sorry.<br/>
&gt; When others object to those sincere apologies and want to demand one from<br/>
&gt; the offending party, that just smacks too much of retribution, and forced<br/>
&gt; apologies aren&#39;t worth anything anyway.<br/>

&gt; If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants to<br/>
&gt; unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is just going <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; overwhelm and confuse them. Because there CAN be unschooling in a family <br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; kids also have chores and bedtimes and have to clean their plates. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; personally think it will have the depth or benefit, ultimately, as a house <br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; the children&#39;s preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>
&gt; I think this is a good point, and something I had been wondering  about. <br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt; have unschooled for the past five years. My children had no assigned <br/>
&gt; academic<br/>
&gt; work; no TV, computer, or video game rules; and in general did what  they<br/>
&gt; wanted to when they wanted to. But they did have chores, and they did <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; regular meal and snack times and no food in between, and they did have <br/>
&gt; bedtimes.<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, after being on this list for only a few days, I started<br/>
&gt; to get the point of doing away with bedtimes, food control, and chores. I <br/>
&gt; saw<br/>
&gt; the whole picture and respect my children a lot more because of it. We no<br/>
&gt; longer have assigned chores and surprise, surprise, my children often are<br/>
&gt; willing to help out anyways. We no longer have any food controls, and I <br/>
&gt; ask my<br/>
&gt; children what they would like before I go to the grocery store, and <br/>
&gt; believe it  or<br/>
&gt; not, I think they eat healthier than before. We no longer have bedtimes, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; the kids do stay up a lot later than they used to, and they&#39;re sometimes <br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; noisy even when I tell them that I&#39;m trying to rest, but this is still new<br/>
&gt; to them, and I think they&#39;ll settle down after a while when they trust the<br/>
&gt; situation more.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s great that all these topics were discussed on this list. This<br/>
&gt; is a great place for other unschoolers like myself to see that there can <br/>
&gt; be so<br/>
&gt; much more to unschooling than just not doing formal academics.<br/>

&gt; -=-And,  in my<br/>
&gt; view the discussions I read in radical unschooling forums are quite<br/>
&gt;simply the practical application of NCP. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it can&#39;t be the practical application of a philosophy people never <br/>
&gt; heard<br/>
&gt; of, or have heard about but don&#39;t care about, or have been told repeatedly<br/>
&gt; of by someone who&#39;s also saying what we&#39;re doing is highly coercive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My response to that was never more than  &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When someone refused to share real stories but was willing to pick  apart<br/>
&gt; ours as wrong and coercive, when nobody ordered home NCP therapy, it was<br/>
&gt; irritating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So while it  might be the practical application or real living of what <br/>
&gt; NCP<br/>
&gt; says might be ideal, it&#39;s not &quot;simply&quot; the application of that <br/>
&gt; philosophy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can coerce someone I respect.  I do it often. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe I couldn&#39;t respect someone I would never, ever bother to try to<br/>
&gt; persuade or change.<br/>
&gt; (Just thinking aloud with my fingers--this is a probably-fleeting idea <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; not a theory or a conviction.)  If a friend of mine is drinking too  much <br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; know he needs to be somewhere in the morning and doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
&gt; embarrass<br/>
&gt; himself or spend all his money, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to try to get him  to <br/>
&gt; stop.<br/>
&gt;  If my husband is somewhere and no longer having ANY fun, I  would think <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; a gift to him and all concerned to suggest something more fun to  do, or <br/>
&gt; voice<br/>
&gt; some justifications he could use for leaving right thne and coming  back<br/>
&gt; later if he&#39;s more in the mood.  (Thinking of SCA situations, just for<br/>
&gt; clarification.)   If Kirby is being indecisive about what to do but I <br/>
&gt; know a friend of<br/>
&gt; his is waiting for a phone call and he&#39;s supposed to be  watching a movie <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; another friend, I&#39;ll play secretary for him for long  enough to help him<br/>
&gt; formulate an efficient plan for the afternoon or  evening.  I won&#39;t MAKE <br/>
&gt; him make<br/>
&gt; a phone call or whatever, but sometimes  people WANT others to help them<br/>
&gt; channel their vague unrest and angst.   Waiting for them to make their own<br/>
&gt; decisions without any pressure can be cruel,  if you know that the outcome <br/>
&gt; of pressing<br/>
&gt; them to do what needs to be done and  not to forget their friends, their<br/>
&gt; commitments, their even-slightly-stated  intentions.<br/>

&gt; really, the kids mostly played Neopets, and I mostly read email lists<br/>
&gt; especially this one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do we still do that?  No.  Eventually our interests moved on and now<br/>
&gt; my 7 and 11 yo dd&#39;s rarely use the computer.  I could just see a more<br/>
&gt; traditionally inclined parent trying to limit them back then and now<br/>
&gt; forcing them, lol!  I still use the computer about 8 hours a day, but<br/>
&gt; for a wide variety of things.  My 11 yo ds and 8 yo dd use it<br/>
&gt; regularly for email, a few games, writing, and occasionally looking<br/>
&gt; things up.  My 16 yo dd progressed from a few months of nothing but<br/>
&gt; Neopets to managing several websites, doing paid graphic design work,<br/>
&gt; writing award winning fan-fic, and keeping the entire family up on<br/>
&gt; current events.  She also currently spends around 8 hours a day on the<br/>
&gt; computer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t worry.  If you don&#39;t restrict her, she will find the path<br/>
&gt; that is best for her.  Of course, if her activities are seriously<br/>
&gt; affecting other family members in a negative way some compromise might<br/>
&gt; be in order, not just by her but by others too.<br/>

&gt; SUBJECT: Not really unschoolers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Greetings  Chris and Tuckerville,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I saw each of your posts on this list and would  like to comment, as both <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; founder and producer of the Rethinking Education  Conference series in <br/>
&gt; Dallas<br/>
&gt; (our next conference is coming up, visit <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rethinkingeducation.com">http://www.rethinkingeducation.com</a><br/>
&gt; for details) and a follower of TCS for  many years.  First, to address <br/>
&gt; Chris&#39;<br/>
&gt; memory of a few years back in  which a child at the conference called 911<br/>
&gt; (not once but twice!).  At no  point did I or other conference organizers<br/>
&gt; explain away the seriousness of  the incident as &quot;kids will be kids&quot;.  In<br/>
&gt; fact, as soon as police showed  up in response to the 911 call, the <br/>
&gt; organizer<br/>
&gt; at the microphone (we were in  the middle of our Talent Show) asked for<br/>
&gt; parents&#39; help in finding the culprit  and resolving the problem.  Many<br/>
&gt; parents left the room immediately to  check on their children and a young <br/>
&gt; boy<br/>
&gt; admitted to his father that he had  dialed 911, not having any idea that<br/>
&gt; police would show up, much less that it  was a felony to commit this act.<br/>
&gt; The father and mother both pulled the boy  aside and then addressed the<br/>
&gt; audience with an apology.  After a  discussion with the police, it was<br/>
&gt; determined that the act was not  malevolent, but innocent.  No charges <br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; filed and no further  incidents occurred.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Further, I don&#39;t have any reason to believe that a  TCS audience, child or<br/>
&gt; family would permit a criminal, dangerous or felonious  act to be <br/>
&gt; committed<br/>
&gt; by their child.  Tuckerville in my estimation  misunderstands TCS <br/>
&gt; philosophy<br/>
&gt; when stating &quot;the child can flat out refuse to  consider anyone else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; feelings,  needs and desires, and the parent  would be philosophy-bound <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; to coerce them  in any way, regardless of  the direness of the situation.&quot;<br/>
&gt; My experience and study of TCS tells me that  while it is never <br/>
&gt; appropriate<br/>
&gt; to coerce a child to right action, a TCS parent  would never stand by to<br/>
&gt; witness a child engaged in activity dangerous to  himself or another.  The<br/>
&gt; parent would be compelled to remove the child  from the situation, e.g., <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; classic argument of the child running into a  busy highway.   This is a<br/>
&gt; crucial element of the philosophy not  often discussed, and in my personal<br/>
&gt; experience not an issue where TCS is the  standard, consistent parenting<br/>
&gt; model.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my experience and  study of TCS, in families where the authoritarian <br/>
&gt; model<br/>
&gt; of parenting is being  replaced with a TCS model, there can be quite a lot <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; fluctuation in  behavior, both from the children and the parents, as <br/>
&gt; everyone<br/>
&gt; struggles to  establish solidarity and reliability in communication style.<br/>
&gt; As a parent who  has raised three children, now grown, with a TCS approach<br/>
&gt; (although frankly I  never knew there was a label for it, now known as <br/>
&gt; TCS),<br/>
&gt; I can attest to the  complete lack of motive a child has to rebel or act <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; dangerous behavior  when raised in an environment where his parents can<br/>
&gt; ALWAYS be trusted to give  their honest opinions,  give reliable <br/>
&gt; information<br/>
&gt; on all subjects the  child is curious about, and both respected and <br/>
&gt; trusted<br/>
&gt; to make the best  decisions for both himself and others affected by his<br/>
&gt; decisions (all TCS  tenets).  A child raised in such an atmosphere seeks <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; parents&#39;  opinions and counsel and while he might not always follow the<br/>
&gt; advice, he  knows his decision will be respected.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been a part of discussions  and debate on TCS for years, and I<br/>
&gt; sympathize with the difficulty in  understanding it and putting it into <br/>
&gt; play<br/>
&gt; - it certainly is a radical  alternative from the traditional parenting <br/>
&gt; model<br/>
&gt; of &quot;do what I say because I  said so&quot;.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, TCS is a<br/>
&gt; revolutionary approach with  great promise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hey move to Connecticut! LOL We don&#39;t even file notice and we&#39;re not<br/>
&gt;&gt; any kind of school (not even private school); there are unschoolers<br/>
&gt;&gt; and relaxed eclectic types and inclusive/secular support groups; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; we rarely ever have a tornado - there was one that touched down about<br/>
&gt;&gt; 2 years ago, didn&#39;t even really register as an F1! We do however have<br/>
&gt;&gt; the occasional blizzard or hurricane.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, and you guys don&#39;t have sales tax either, right?  Another plus.  TBH, <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; love, love CT.  I used to live right across the border in Westchester <br/>
&gt; County<br/>
&gt; as a nanny, Chappaqua to be exact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However,  I am way to scared to make a move cross-country (don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; there)  and I don&#39;t think the COL is all that much lower than S. <br/>
&gt; California<br/>
&gt; anyhow.  Darn.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today Holly and I (and Vincent King, another homeschooler friend) all <br/>
&gt; spent<br/>
&gt; the day at Sandia Prep, a private school here, where I played etymology <br/>
&gt; games<br/>
&gt; and told stories to my friend Mo Palmer&#39;s 7th grade history classes. <br/>
&gt; Holly<br/>
&gt; just love to observe school kids. They had new desks and she got to sit in<br/>
&gt; one.  Vincent&#39;s dad wants him to go to school next year, and this is his <br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt; of choice.  He&#39;s already done the formal all-day visitation, and I <br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; he might like to spend another day there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Holly came home and played Halo II for a few hours and just had this IM<br/>
&gt; exchange which really made her yell for me in the next room, and I went <br/>
&gt; and got<br/>
&gt; her dad too.  She&#39;s thrilled:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: hey<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: u play halo well this is Moto Mac do u  rember?<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: oh yeah, i &#39;member<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: well i was  looking at gamertag pics and u were one of <br/>
&gt; scotts<br/>
&gt; friend and u live in the same  town as me<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: really?<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: yeah<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232:  what school do u go to<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: actually I&#39;m  homeschooled<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: omg did u go to my school  today?<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: kind of<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: o mean  maybe?<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: ok<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: lol<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: well sandia  prep?<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: yes! omg<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: omg<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: in mrs  palmers<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: ?<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: yeah<br/>
&gt; HiperSpaz232: yeah i was  in there in activity when we were watching<br/>
&gt; frankenstien<br/>
&gt; BlazingOranges: oh my  god! that is so cool<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So...<br/>
&gt; While it&#39;s great that Holly&#39;s played with kids from New Zealand and <br/>
&gt; England<br/>
&gt; and all over north America, this is even more impressive, statistically<br/>
&gt; speaking. &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s played with this girls several times  before.<br/>

&gt; Subject: PBS Colonial House<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of my recent finds at our local library was PBS Colonial House on DVD. <br/>
&gt; Maybe some will enjoy reading my thoughts on our viewing it.  Maybe not.<br/>
&gt; Mary Ellen<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://melonary.blogspot.com/">http://melonary.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
&gt; 21st Centurions in the 16th Century<br/>
&gt; We finished watching Colonial House today. Our experience in viewing this <br/>
&gt; together is such a great example of the manner in which real learning <br/>
&gt; cannot be contained by mere subjects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The schooled part of me wanted to tell more than one person (you know who <br/>
&gt; those people might be) that we spent the week studying history, or more <br/>
&gt; specifically, the Colonial era. And that is true, we did. The program <br/>
&gt; highlighted many of the realities of colonists to New England during the <br/>
&gt; early 1600&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the study of anything in the past is so much more than history. For <br/>
&gt; starters, there was a great deal of herstory. Not to mention childrenstory <br/>
&gt; and indigentpeoplestory, or at least a mention of the last two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What made the show especially fascinating to me was the sharing of the <br/>
&gt; 21st century participant&#39;s views of living four months in the physical <br/>
&gt; space of 1628. At first glance, it may seem that people wanting to break <br/>
&gt; free from the bonds of indentured servant or women&#39;s subservience to men <br/>
&gt; is a modern thing. However, I think that these desires have always been <br/>
&gt; so, and it is only minor variances in society that promote big steps in <br/>
&gt; behavioral changes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other point is that any time we consider something that can be <br/>
&gt; categorized (this is history!), we actually experience a far greater range <br/>
&gt; of ideas. History just means it happened previous to now. Just because it <br/>
&gt; happened in the past doesn&#39;t mean it is limited to *history*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Serendipity comes into play as well, with this particular show leading us <br/>
&gt; to a discussion of homosexuality, followed by Lisa&#39;s magazine subscription <br/>
&gt; coming in the mail and containing information on the same topic. (Jonathon <br/>
&gt; came out in episode 4 of Colonial House, and the Governor hoped his <br/>
&gt; confession was the first step towards changing his evil ways. This led to <br/>
&gt; a discussion about being gay and people&#39;s beliefs on homosexuality being <br/>
&gt; something you are born with or something you choose. Later, Lisa was <br/>
&gt; reading one of her magazines and shared the letters to the editor. <br/>
&gt; Apparently the last issue had a quiz to help people know if they are gay <br/>
&gt; or not. Two of the letters criticized the magazine editors for printing <br/>
&gt; such a quiz, suggesting that young people will only become gay if they <br/>
&gt; know it&#39;s an option. One of the letters was from a girl who had thought <br/>
&gt; she might be gay, but after taking the quiz decided she wasn&#39;t.)  Today <br/>
&gt; Lisa told me that she is going to attempt to create gay SIMs characters. I <br/>
&gt; asked her how one programs their romance aspects and she explained that <br/>
&gt; you create the family tree, so she is going to make male/male or <br/>
&gt; female/female spouses and see what happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pat and I had also been discussing homosexuality recently because it has <br/>
&gt; been in the national news headlines. Pat&#39;s cousin died from AIDs <br/>
&gt; complications in the 80&#39;s. I never met him, but I&#39;ve asked Pat questions <br/>
&gt; about his childhood memories of Terry. When did he realize his cousin was <br/>
&gt; gay? What led him to realize it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jackie was not as interested in the Colonial House program, though she did <br/>
&gt; watch about half of it. She was interested in their clothing. While we <br/>
&gt; watched, she spent some time playing with Barbies and Digi-draw, and drew <br/>
&gt; a number of portraits. In one Colonial House episode, one of the colonists <br/>
&gt; drew a charcoal portrait of the lay preacher/governor. Other colonists <br/>
&gt; were envious of the *leisure time* afforded to the artist (who was <br/>
&gt; commanded to make the portrait) while the rest of them were processing <br/>
&gt; lumber or preparing meals. Jackie asked me if I would borrow Colonial <br/>
&gt; House from the library another time, and watch with her.  I said yes, then <br/>
&gt; she went off to play something else.<br/>
