<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846965410">Pledge of Allegiance<br/>
<br/>
Here is something we made up after watching nick news this morning and <br/>
talking about this whole God/country thing.<br/>
<br/>
this is what we came up with. Salute it, mock it, ignore it, embrace it... <br/>
whatever you may.  But nonetheless, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
I pledge allegiance to my country,<br/>
The United States of America,<br/>
And to the people,<br/>
For which all stands proud,<br/>
One nation founded upon religious freedom,<br/>
Undividable, with individuality and equality for all.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not debating anything, just venting some brain steam.<br/>
<br/>
Proud to be an American!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
