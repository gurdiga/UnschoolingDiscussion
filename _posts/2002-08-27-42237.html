&gt;&gt; My point is, and I do have one, why exactly do we keep jumping on<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ned and Bob and anyone else who seems to have very strong feelings<br/>
&gt;&gt; one way or the other on subjects that seem to me to fit very neatly<br/>
&gt;&gt; into an unschooling discussion?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You may be interested in a list that discusses homeschooling and<br/>
&gt; education-related politics - sounds like you are. I&#39;d like to suggest the<br/>
&gt; NHEN legislative list for that purpose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe that it is accurate to say that this list is not really just a list<br/>
&gt; for unschoolers to talk and debate about absolutely anything -- it is a list<br/>
&gt; that is actually ABOUT unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly my recent point....so please explain the weeks of discussions of<br/>
religion, God, old boyfriends, hippop/rap, in-laws, bad experiences with<br/>
schools, what state we&#39;re in, pen pals, etc, etc, without a word of<br/>
connection to unschooling nor any complaint about them......so<br/>
<br/>
I ask again: Will one (or more) of the nice people who so often say that I&#39;m<br/>
off topic please tell us their views of unschooling, without complaining<br/>
about my posts or my views, or anyone else&#39;s? Please, start a thread that&#39;s<br/>
purely about unschooling.<br/>
