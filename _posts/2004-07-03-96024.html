<div id="ygrps-yiv-399249889">COOL!  While I was working on another post, this one came, and is about the <br/>
same topic.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is no single statement that would cause all parents to realize the <br/>
benefits of removing limits.  It takes many conversations and hearing or reading <br/>
stories of families where it is working.  Maybe some people read one thing, <br/>
one time and totally change, but I needed to hear or read it over and over <br/>
before it made sense.  It also took self examination for me to realize areas I was <br/>
setting limits without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Mary Ellen&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the Life Learning post before this, I had quoted the end of a letter to <br/>
the editor who was thanking them for the anti-&quot;machine&quot; article.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second of two pararaphs there:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;I say, everything in balance, in its own developmentally appropriate <br/>
time.  However, I am not about to let my two-year-old child play in traffic in the <br/>
name of freedom; nor will she have unfettered use of electronic media until <br/>
she can make that decision for herself.&quot;<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Had that been posted here by its author, it might have been taken apart and <br/>
put back together in more logical fashion, and not published in an <br/>
international magazine.  <br/>
<br/>
When WOULD a child make a decision for herself to play in traffic or to &quot;have <br/>
unfettered use of electronic media&quot; ?  (I&#39;m guessing that the unfettered use <br/>
carried a motherly assumption of all kinds of porn and bomb-building and <br/>
violence, not the more-likely kid-sites like uptoten or neopets or a zoo webcam of <br/>
a baby giraffe, or whatever all&#39;s currently &quot;zoocammed&quot; this week.  But even <br/>
if it&#39;s unfettered two-year-old use of a patterns game or coloring program, <br/>
where&#39;s the evil in &quot;unfettered&quot;?  Fetters are not gotreme and not thought <br/>
through.<br/>
A two year old who is unlikely to be able to use the mouse well enough to <br/>
click on PuttPutt won&#39;t play long, and she certainly won&#39;t find objectional <br/>
websites.  And if she does, she won&#39;t read them. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, until children are given choices, they can&#39;t make decisions.  And <br/>
even two year olds can be given choices.  I&#39;ve known a lot of two year olds, <br/>
and if I had one who would rather play in traffic than sit in my lap or hold <br/>
my hand, I would think there was something wrong with the life I was offering <br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
I read Holly a parental statement which had been posted in public, and her <br/>
response as an always-unschooled twelve-year-old was interesting.  Here&#39;s that, <br/>
but they&#39;re also at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-This one is just almost too big for this page, so brace yourself:<br/>
If my kids had their way, they&#39;d go barefoot outside of their own yard, run <br/>
in the street between cars, never take baths, never eat their veggies and <br/>
instead opt for chocolate cake every meal, mistreat animals, burn down the house <br/>
playing with matches, never go to bed, never brush their teeth, etc. -=-<br/>
<br/>
And Holly&#39;s response:<br/>
<br/>
I read that to Holly and she was speechless. Seriously mouth-open disbelief. <br/>
Then she asked &quot;WHY would they burn the house down with matches?&quot;<br/>
&quot;The only reason her house is not burned down is because she has a rule <br/>
against playing with matches.&quot;<br/>
&quot;So she can&#39;t even say &#39;You can play with matches but only in the front <br/>
driveway&#39;?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br/>
&quot;So they&#39;ll never go to bed because they&#39;ll never get tired unless she tells <br/>
them they&#39;re tired?&quot;<br/>
She asked me to read it to her again. I did. She looked at it and looked at <br/>
me and said with more feeling, &quot;Why the hell would they run between cars in the <br/>
street!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
And so...<br/>
A child knows these things are nonsense, but adults who have reproduced can <br/>
go so far as to publish them for the &quot;benefit&quot; of other parents??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe some people just don&#39;t really think.<br/>
They justify. <br/>
They pull phrases from the other justifying parents around them to defend <br/>
their controlling behavior.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s for your own good.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll thank me later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s not good, they won&#39;t thank them, and the parents would have <br/>
done better to do more thinking and less talking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708399541">I don&#39;t yet subscribe to Life Learning, but reading what you all are writing <br/>
about sort of made me smile.  I find myself going through the stages of <br/>
teaching myself to &quot;let go&quot; with my children.  And, of course, I do not mean this <br/>
literally.... but figuratively.  Letting go of all my &quot;rules&quot;.  As a new parent <br/>
years ago, I told myself I would never be over controlling with ridiculous <br/>
rules set, simply for the sake of setting a rule.  But as years went on, I had <br/>
quite a few.  Perhaps not to the extent many other parents had them, but enough <br/>
to be overbearing.  But over the past 6 months that I&#39;ve been homeschooling, I <br/>
have made concious efforts to lay off, and I&#39;ve seen wonderful changes in <br/>
both my children.  Recently (this past week) my son (8) has again been asking me <br/>
to get his ear pierced.  This is something I&#39;ve adamently said no too for <br/>
years now.  He&#39;s been asking since he was 4.  But, after talking with him I&#39;ve <br/>
realized it&#39;s just something he really wants, so why the heck not?  Having been <br/>
asking for 4 years, clearly it&#39;s something he feels he needs for his own <br/>
self-expression.  So, this coming week, I&#39;m going to take him and have it done.  <br/>
I&#39;ve only ever said no, because I didn&#39;t (don&#39;t) think a young boy looks <br/>
appropriate with one.  But  who am I to judge??  I have find my ways of thinking <br/>
changing over these months, and I truly think it&#39;s for the better.<br/>
As for 2-3 year olds having freedom of choice... well, ya&#39;ll should meet my 3 <br/>
year old daughter!!! hahaha  She demands freedom of choice and always has.  <br/>
My son is very much &quot;mommy&#39;s boy&quot; and is much more needy.  But my daughter is a <br/>
true free spirit and has ALWAYS been very independant and self-reliant.  When <br/>
she asks for something you learn very quickly to ask her for DETAILS in how <br/>
she wants it, otherwise you have a full fledged temper tantrum on hand.  I <br/>
don&#39;t find this catering or spoiling either.  (as many others try to tell me it <br/>
is)  I view it as allowing her to be herself.  And being Stephanie means, <br/>
knowing what, when, where, why, and how she wants things.  Example:  she asks for a <br/>
drink.  You can&#39;t just get up and assume what she wants.  I ask her &quot;what <br/>
would you like to drink?  Ok, which cup do you want that in today? How much do you <br/>
want?  Alot or a little?&quot;  Simple enough, I think.  She gets just what she&#39;s <br/>
wanting, and I don&#39;t get to hear her screaming because I &quot;DID IT WRONG!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ve become very aware of the changes in my parenting.  And have become <br/>
reminded of how much I despised my own parents during my teen years when they were <br/>
so overbearing (they called it being &quot;protective&quot;) that I was not allowed out <br/>
of the house after dark, even if it was winter and dark at 3:30pm.  All my <br/>
calls were monitored (meaning listened in on by a 2nd phone line), and never <br/>
allowed sleep overs and etc etc.  I can&#39;t bear to be that way with my own kids.  <br/>
Well thanks for listening all.... I&#39;m SO thrilled I found this group!<br/>

no one would let him touch the intriguing things and so he hid in a closet<br/>
to try them out.  Lots of heartache could have been spared if a trusted<br/>

it in the driveway where nothing can catch fire.&quot;  (No one was hurt but the<br/>

<br/>
That is so harsh.<br/>
<br/>
I had a best friend who was similarly sheltered.  I don&#39;t think the monitored <br/>
phone calls, but they told her to hurry up and get off the phone the second <br/>
she got on, and when we were sixteen and she asked &quot;Can I go for a coke with <br/>
Sandra?&quot; her mom said &quot;We have cokes here.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking yesterday (as I watered the yard, a good thinking time) about <br/>
people who will say things like &quot;Oh, you&#39;re just reacting to the way your own <br/>
parents treated you and you&#39;ll just do the opposite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny how people who are making those claims so often use the grating word <br/>
&quot;just.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t react to the way we were raised, if we don&#39;t look to our own <br/>
personal experiences for good and bad examples, then how WILL we decide?  By <br/>
buying a book with a pretty cover?  Letting friends at church or a parenting group <br/>
bully us into doing what they&#39;re doing without understanding why?   <br/>
<br/>
There are WAY worse ways of deciding how to be with children than the careful <br/>
examination of our childhood memories combined with the conscious observation <br/>
of them now, today, in their own environments.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely Sandra!  We all learn by example, and if that means taking example <br/>
from our own childhood, then whats wrong with that??  What I don&#39;t understand <br/>
is why so many think that it makes more sense to raise children with fear, <br/>
rather than love and respect.  Rigid rules, with no explanation for them other <br/>
than &quot;because I said so.&quot;  It&#39;s mind boggling to me.  I actually go through <br/>
this with my children&#39;s father.  <br/>
Insert question here:  Does anyone else out there have this dilemna??  Where <br/>
one parent is for unschooling and the other is not???  If so, how do you find <br/>
middle ground?  <br/>
My hubby has a VERY different outlook on parenting than I do, and it makes it <br/>
very hard for all of us.  He&#39;ll often say no to them for the simplest of <br/>
things, and, my son especially, will ask &quot;why?&quot; and all he can say is &quot;because I <br/>
said so.&quot;  Now this leaves my son confused, as I am the total opposite.  I <br/>
often allow them the things hubby says no too, and I always offer a valid <br/>
explanation should I have to say no to something.  I find lately that both my children <br/>
are much more gravitated towards me, and will now say things like, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to stay home with daddy, can&#39;t I go with you?&quot;  This is starting to break <br/>
my heart, and dad&#39;s also.  I&#39;ve tried discussing things with hubby, but he <br/>
just doesn&#39;t understand where my feelings/views come from.<br/>
Any advice here would be warmly welcomed and appreciated!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My next-door neighbor, a boy named, &quot;Mikey,&quot; burned down a building at <br/>
our school - hiding behind it and playing with matches. Mikey&#39;s mom <br/>
used to slap his hand all the time - he&#39;d reach for something, she&#39;d <br/>
slap his hand. I have such a vivid memory of that - it happened so <br/>
often. Mikey also swallowed a full bottle of St. Joseph&#39;s Children&#39;s <br/>
Aspirin - those sweet, soft little pink ones. Had to have his stomach <br/>
pumped.<br/>
<br/>
I got in trouble at school for playing with a magnifying glass - <br/>
burning holes in leaves. I did it out in the middle of the asphalt far <br/>
far away from any buildings. It was the only time I ever got into <br/>
trouble in elementary school - I was traumatized by having to go sit in <br/>
the hall outside the principal&#39;s office where the &quot;bad&quot; kids always <br/>
sat. When kids in our homeschooling group wanted to play with <br/>
magnifying glasses and fire it was great - parents brought them stuff <br/>
to do it with - tinder and a variety of magnifying glasses. It made me <br/>
so happy.<br/>

Poor guy, to live with that memory all those years.  And I bet the mom never <br/>
felt guilty or considered it her fault, and that he always DID consider his <br/>
natural need to know (not just &quot;desire&quot; to know, or &quot;urge to play with matches,&quot; <br/>
but his real human *NEED* to know) to be a flaw, a failure, &quot;disobedience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How much cheaper and safer it is to just let a kid light some friggin&#39; <br/>
matches.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a weird idea, &quot;unfettered access&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I never bought a kid a case of stick matches and said &quot;Here, whenever and <br/>
wherever you&#39;re ready...&quot;   But neither have I ever felt the need to hide <br/>
matches.  The &quot;secret&quot; (if it&#39;s secret) or the trick (if it&#39;s a trick) is being with <br/>
the children when they ask, finding them a safe place, a candle to light, a <br/>
good place to put the still-hot matches; answering their questions; telling real <br/>
stories about kids and property being hurt, and what they might do if things <br/>
go wrong (cold water on burns, blankets to smother flames--don&#39;t worry about <br/>
the blanket, call 911 if you can&#39;t get the fire out...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055022829">&lt;&lt;&lt;My hubby has a VERY different outlook on parenting than I do, and it<br/>
makes it very hard for all of us. &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This is wild, almost exactly the same discussion happening on<br/>
UnschoolingBasics with another wife who wrote almost those exact words.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to cut and paste some of what I replied there (sorry to be dull<br/>
for those on both lists) :<br/>
<br/>
There is a message board for Dads at www.unschooling.com and there is a<br/>
workshop for Dads at the Live and Learn Conference. My dh really enjoyed<br/>
that experience. There were some reluctant spouses there, but since the men<br/>
agreed to keep the content of the meeting confidential that is the extent of<br/>
my knowledge about the event.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a message board about dealing with reluctant relatives there<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is not reluctant by any means, and &quot;gets it&quot; totally. However he<br/>
sometimes is complacent, whereas I am always seeking to become more deeply<br/>
immersed in Unschooling and increase my awareness and mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to give my dh articles, but I found out that he was<br/>
interpreting my giving him the suggestion to read stuff as a criticism of<br/>
himself. So it was making him sad, grumpy and defensive instead of open to<br/>
the ideas in the article or book. Now if I find something I think he would<br/>
appreciate, I talk to him about it first. I found he would not read a whole<br/>
book, but sometimes will look at highlighted passages. Sometimes I just read<br/>
bits out loud to him, after asking if he wants to hear it.<br/>

How can you allow safe experiences with dangerous things like these? I&#39;d kinda like to let them see the conductivity and dangerous combination of electricity and water, but don&#39;t know how to manage that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My dd asked (jokingly) if she could bring an electric appliance into the <br/>

How can you allow safe experiences with dangerous things like these?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She was joking.<br/>
I probably would have said &quot;Not today.  Save it until you really want to die <br/>
a stinky, sparkly death, and you might want to call news crews beforehand. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Truth doesn&#39;t have to be delivered in a lecturely deadpan way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(When she was three she wanted to see if that key would fit into the <br/>
electric socket. I found out when she screamed. I she learned that lesson the hard <br/>
way.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I told kids from before they spoke any language themselves that the outlets <br/>
were &quot;owies,&quot; and &quot;careful!&quot;  They saw me plug things in and take them out, and <br/>
I would talk to them.  &quot;I&#39;m going to hold the plug here and not pull it by <br/>
the cord, because if the cord breaks it can shock us.&quot;  We had outlet covers at <br/>
first, when we only had one and two kids, but by the time Holly came along we <br/>
weren&#39;t using them.  (Probably it was because we had filled the house up more <br/>
and they were all full of plugs.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s sitting here and I jsut asked her if she ever remembered outlet <br/>
covers.<br/>
No.<br/>
I asked if she had ever stuck anything in an outlet and she said once, a My <br/>
Little Pony.  But it didn&#39;t fit.  She said it was in the hallway at a <br/>
homeschooling conference in Colorado.  She and her friend were playing with their <br/>
Ponies, and one had a unicorn horn and she was pretending it needed to be charged <br/>
back up.  It didn&#39;t fit in the outlet, and it was plastic anyway, but she says <br/>
I said sharply, &quot;DON&#39;T do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if she would&#39;ve stuck something metal in and she said no.<br/>
<br/>
(Kind of a stupid question on my part since she had plenty of opportunity.)<br/>
<br/>
I think kids HAVE to experiment, and parents say &quot;no&quot; too much.<br/>
<br/>
If parents say no about everything, kids can tend to ignore them.  If you <br/>
save no for the really truly dangerous and important things, then &quot;no&quot; is <br/>
powerful.  If every day has a soundtrack of &quot;no, no,  no, don&#39;t, stop,&quot;  kids stop <br/>
hearing it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d kinda like to let them see the conductivity and dangerous combination <br/>
of electricity and water, but don&#39;t know how to manage that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just stories and maybe photos of electrocutions.  Maybe you know <br/>
someone who&#39;s worked for the power company and could tell stories, but maybe there&#39;s <br/>
stuff on the internet, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That happened with a neighbor and her son. She just kept fussing at <br/>
him (and calling him Baby in front of his friends) when the kids were <br/>
climbing a small tree and he just ignored her or snapped at her. Next <br/>
day when I had the kids without their parents (muuuuch better, I&#39;m <br/>
sorry to say), the boy climbed high and far trying to do something <br/>
another kid had been able to do and he was starting to look nervous <br/>
and I just quietly said &quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good idea&quot; and he <br/>
immediately got back to where he was comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
Why do so many people overestimate their kids&#39; ability (not to <br/>
mention desire) to conform happily and underestimate the kids&#39; <br/>
skills, both mental and physical?<br/>
<br/>
I laughed at my mom the other day when she, prompted by some story I <br/>
was telling about my kids, told me &quot;Your father and I could never get <br/>
you to understand that when you dropped food on the floor, it went <br/>
somewhere!&quot; As in, someone had to pick it up then or later. <br/>
<br/>
Little babies drop food off their high chairs and watch it fall; I <br/>
just didn&#39;t care! Even if I was the one who had to pick it up later...<br/>
<br/>
And I underestimated my son&#39;s ability to understand money. I&#39;d posted <br/>
that when I told him something was expensive he&#39;d just whine that we <br/>
should buy it for $1 (he&#39;s 3.5, why should he understand, lol). Well, <br/>
I decided to try the allowance idea and started giving him $5 a week <br/>
to spend on Thomas toys. He&#39;s up to $15 and hasn&#39;t bought anything. <br/>
He looks online and in the catalogs, reads the prices to me, and we <br/>
talk about whether he can afford it or how many weeks he would have <br/>
to wait. He&#39;s stopped complaining, which has made it a million times <br/>
easier for me to enjoy the shopping process.<br/>

Zounds! We went through the same thing with Thomas ten years ago :). <br/>
I&#39;m a firm believer of giving kids extra money without strings. I&#39;ve <br/>
had nothing but good results, even my &quot;holey pocket&quot; kid managed to <br/>
learn the value of $20. (Although it did take him until 16 to do it. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...it&#39;s hard to break that cycle. I&#39;m just glad through <br/>
unschooling that kids can be respected, can be allowed emotions, can <br/>
be encouraged to do and feel what makes them happy, content, or <br/>
healthy. My son still sometimes questions our unschooling because he <br/>
thinks that they&#39;re doing something in that building he should be <br/>
doing but when we discuss it and talk pros and cons, it&#39;s so obvious <br/>
he&#39;s more mature, self sufficent, and innocent of the bullying and <br/>
damage that comes from it......it&#39;s worth every uncertain moment I&#39;ve <br/>
ever had to see him with good self esteem and a sense of worthiness. <br/>
He could have been a very misunderstood, miserable lump of a child if <br/>
it wasn&#39;t for unschooling.</div>

I see those things in my children.  And I also see an innocense and <br/>
willingness to &quot;be immature&quot; in a sweet way.  Not immature, but playful.  Amazed.  Not <br/>
jaded.   <br/>
<br/>
Though Holly has watched R rated movies (not *all* of them, not <br/>
indiscriminately), she&#39;s still willing to watch Teletubbies and Arthur.    They&#39;re not on a <br/>
continuum, where they grasp the new thing and reject the old to prove they&#39;re <br/>
&quot;old enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like being a different species.<br/>
When things like that have been said before (once not too long ago on <br/>
unschooling.com, when someone described how very different unschoolers she knows <br/>
are), some schoolkids and teachers go near-ballistic about denying it.<br/>
<br/>
Sure there are some school kids who have joy and wonder.<br/>
There are some unschooled kids who are cynical.<br/>
<br/>
Those are exceptions, in my experience.<br/>

imaginary games with absolutely nothing around me,  except a single paper <br/>

I find  lately that both my children <br/>
are much more gravitated towards me, and will  now say things like, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to stay home with daddy, can&#39;t I go  with you?&quot;  This is starting to <br/>
break <br/>
my heart, and dad&#39;s also.   I&#39;ve tried discussing things with hubby, but he <br/>
just doesn&#39;t understand  where my feelings/views come from.<br/>
Any advice here would be warmly welcomed  and appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened with my children.  They DID do some things  with <br/>
their dad but clearly choose to spend their time with me.  We parent  VERY <br/>
differently.  He never really was fully &quot;on board&quot; with the children  having a choice <br/>
on going to school or not.  He just accepted that they were  engaged in <br/>
something fun or exciting and he didn&#39;t say much about it for the  most part.<br/>
 <br/>
I tried to include him as much a possible but sometimes it was better and  <br/>
easier and more fun if we just let him be at whatever he was doing at the  time.<br/>
 <br/>
Fast forward, my children are now 16, almost 20, 21 and 24, they still  <br/>
prefer my company and will choose to be with me.  I think because I am WITH  them <br/>
when they are here.  DH is HERE but might be clicking away on his  laptop or <br/>
sort of watching a movie and tends to really know little about what is  going on <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t directly include him.<br/>
 <br/>
He gets VERY jealous of the relationship I have with the children.   I&#39;ve <br/>
tried over the years to include him in everything we do but the truth is  that I <br/>
often felt like a single parent in a two adult household.  The  &quot;because I <br/>
said so&quot; routine was not acceptable to me, but was to him.<br/>
 <br/>
I feel badly for him, I would be hurt beyond words if I were in his shoes  <br/>
and had the relationship with the children that he does.<br/>
 <br/>
He GIVES them THINGS not time.  Which is good and his non stop working  has <br/>
provided us with the means to do just about everything we&#39;ve wanted to  <br/>
explore.  I much would have rather he been more &quot;plugged in&quot; to us as a  family but <br/>
it just didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
 <br/>
On a recent family trip with all of us, four hotel rooms, same floor, made  <br/>
an &quot;executive decision&quot; that I was no longer available after 10:00 PM as a  <br/>
mother, unless their hair was on fire they were not to call me or come to my  <br/>
room.  The girls and I were laying across the bed in my room and the boys  would <br/>
come up the hall every now and again to relate some information or talk  about <br/>
something we might do the next day.<br/>
 <br/>
Nothing that was of great importance to him but to them it was.  They  could <br/>
have all been out having fun doing something together or apart but were  happy <br/>
to just hang out at the hotel and be in and out of my room.<br/>
 <br/>
I felt sad for him that he felt so left out or less loved or less a part of  <br/>
our family.  But at that moment I also knew that HE created this atmosphere  <br/>
for himself.  Years of his own detaching from them and &quot;allowing&quot; me to do  <br/>
&quot;whatever I think is best&quot; got him to this point.<br/>
 <br/>
I have been extra careful to pay more attention to him as my husband after  <br/>
this, but the children feel no such inclination to try to be more attentive or  <br/>
inclusive of him, probably from years of experience of him nodding and not  <br/>
hearing or simply &quot;not having the time&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know how you could &quot;force&quot; a husband to be more fully a  father.  Not <br/>
just in the sense of providing and playing or even feeding,  changing diapers <br/>
or bathing.  You have to CONNECT on a much deeper level  than just a child <br/>
care provider, sadly my DH still does NOT get this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979218100">** I don&#39;t know how you could &quot;force&quot; a husband to be more fully a  <br/>
father. **<br/>
<br/>
My grandma used to tell her husband &quot;Honey, Virginia would really like <br/>
to go with you on  your errand to the hardware store.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Not advice that works for everyone.  My son thinks a trip to the <br/>
hardware store qualifies as &quot;torture&quot; and is banned by the Geneva <br/>
convention. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
But I think this works better when kids are younger and are honestly <br/>
thrilled to be in the presence of their father.  Kids can be less <br/>
adoring and more critical once they hit the pre-teen years.  I suppose <br/>
at older ages convincing the father to drive the kids (one on one) to <br/>
the places that the kids want to go is the way to implement this.<br/>
<br/>
** He GIVES them THINGS not time.**<br/>
<br/>
There are some books about &quot;love languages&quot; that talk about all of us <br/>
having different things that make us feel the most loved.  I really <br/>
liked to be listened to, but some people prefer gifts or praise or being <br/>
touched or being waited on.  It&#39;s an interesting topic to discuss with <br/>
your kids and then pass on the info to your husband.  (Couldn&#39;t hurt <br/>
anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s at the age (10) where he prefers videogaming and squirt gun <br/>
battles with his dad over most anything he can do with me.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Maybe going about this backwards and asking the kids to talk about <br/>
what they most enjoy/appreciate about their dad would be a good starting <br/>
point. (Kids are usually less critical than wives, I find, and value <br/>
even crumbs of attention.)  This could be good positive feedback for a <br/>
father to know that &quot;Eldest daughter thinks going to the zoo with you is <br/>
more fun than a day at the mall.&quot;   Or  &quot;Youngest son thinks eating <br/>
pancakes and playing tickle monster is the best way to spend the way <br/>
with dad.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629837434">When I felt like my SO was losing touch with the kids, I&#39;d ask him <br/>
what was bothering him about what we were doing. I would brace myself <br/>
for some criticism and it would come but then...after hearing some <br/>
fairly minor stuff, he&#39;d eventually say what was really on his mind. <br/>
Lots of times it didn&#39;t have much to do with schooling of any kind. <br/>
It was usually a discipline issue or a misunderstanding about what to <br/>
expect out of the children. I always tried to keep my mouth shut and <br/>
not make any excuse or explaination until he was totally finished. <br/>
Then I&#39;d say...&quot;I&#39;ll think about what you&#39;ve just told me and get <br/>
back with you. I need to think here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He got to vent without me interfering and when I would talk to him <br/>
maybe the next day that&#39;s when I&#39;d offer suggestions. I used the <br/>
gesell institute&#39;s age appropriate books and sometimes read them to <br/>
him then. He took this better than just my opinion. Over the years he <br/>
realized that I did research child behavior and didn&#39;t just come up <br/>
with excuses for problems. <br/>
<br/>
My SO was brought up in a very strict household so he was very hard <br/>
to deal with sometimes...today he&#39;ll admit that what I did with the <br/>
kids was right but it took a few years for him to lighten up. My kids <br/>
could only be with him for a certain amount of hours before they had <br/>
had enough. I explained to them that Daddy had been brought up a <br/>
different way and he and I were different but that he loved them. I&#39;d <br/>
then tell them some of the ways his parents treated he and his <br/>
siblings and why things were different now. That helped...kids have <br/>
no idea how things used to be....you have to give them some family <br/>
history sometimes even if it is sucky. I think even young kids can <br/>
empathize with that.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back I wonder why I had to do all that but I guess it&#39;s the <br/>
way men were taught to view their children then. &quot;Do as I say.&quot; Thank <br/>
the stars parenting practises have changed. There are many though <br/>
that still look back to the old ways...it takes a long time to <br/>
change. This has always been a sore spot with me since I believe <br/>
children deserve just as much respect as adults do. Sometimes I <br/>
wonder if we are making any head way....but we are; it&#39;s just <br/>
frustrating to deal with outdated, old fashioned emotional garbage. <br/>

way.  Not immature, but playful.  Amazed.  Not  jaded. They&#39;re not on <br/>
a continuum, where they grasp the new thing and reject the old to <br/>
prove they&#39;re &quot;old enough.&quot; It&#39;s like being a different species.<br/>
<br/>

Yesterday my 6yo son and his 7yo schooled cousin were in the bathroom washing their hands.  We had learned that if you sing Twinkle Little Star, and wash you hands thru the entire song, that you wash long enough to kill all the germs, and my son like to sing anyway, so he loves to do this.  His cousin looked at him and told him that it was a baby song.  I felt so sad for him.  My son still loves to sing the same songs I sang to him as an small child when he gets into bed at night.  He does not choose to do it as often as he use to, but I as still so very happy to sing to him whenever he chooses.  It is so sad that school has completely driven that joy out of this child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674090263">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I am new here although not new to schooling at home. However, I am now <br/>
needing to get outside advice as well as meet others with the same ideas about <br/>
raising children. I am so glad I found this site! Anyhow, I am on my local email <br/>
group list and will soon be participating in the local get-togethers, and would <br/>
love anyone in the Wisconsin area to email me if they are interested. I have <br/>
an almost 8-year old son and a 10 year old daughter (going on 17 it feels <br/>
like!). <br/>
<br/>
As far as  the subject thread. I have learned that the children learn much <br/>
more when THEY are the  ones who initiate the activities. If I suggest it they <br/>
want nothing to do with it, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoying reading all of the emails and looking forward to getting to <br/>
know you all better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970180141">&lt;&lt;it&#39;s just <br/>
frustrating to deal with outdated, old fashioned<br/>
emotional garbage. <br/>
Sara&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is, but it seems like your patience paid off.  I<br/>
have difficulty not offering my opinions, and it&#39;s NOT<br/>
paying off! lol  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just so stern! He&#39;s like his father to him, he<br/>
only pays attention to him when he&#39;s &quot;in trouble&quot;, and<br/>
there I am in the middle explaining why he&#39;s not in<br/>
trouble at all!  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s learned to be so much more open and loving with<br/>
me, I just wish he would do the same with our son. <br/>
Last nite Alex came and gave me hugs and kisses four<br/>
times before bed, lol, and he started to walk over to<br/>
his dad, and stopped, and I had to encourage him. He&#39;s<br/>
not sure whether dada is going to welcome him.  And<br/>
without me there to cue it, he&#39;s right to be unsure. <br/>

Did you say how old Alex is? If your SO can&#39;t be that kind of <br/>
spontaneous I think he may have been damaged by his parents. Why do <br/>
you think he&#39;s like this? Sara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526834118">He&#39;s ten.  They did hug and kiss, were sweet to each<br/>
other, but I could tell, Alex was still unsure. Dh is<br/>
not consistent with affection.  <br/>
<br/>
Yah, dh&#39;s father only paid attention to him when he<br/>
was in &quot;trouble&quot;, bad grades at school, mostly.  And<br/>
then it was either yelling or hitting, or both, and<br/>
then he was &quot;gone&quot; again.  In the house, but watching<br/>
tv or on the puter, can&#39;t be bothered. <br/>
<br/>
Not much healthy modeling on his part, so compared to<br/>
that, dh is doing pretty good.  When Alex was younger,<br/>
he was very loving and open, things have changed as he<br/>
has gotten older.  They still play and have fun, but<br/>
dh gets authoritarian so quickly, it can be confusing<br/>
for Alex. I think, esp confusing because he wasn&#39;t<br/>
like this when he was younger. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering about this a lot lately.  Thinking<br/>
back on my childhood, my mother changed the way she<br/>
treated me around the same age, 10-11.  I changed<br/>
dramtically too, in reaction.  What is it that makes<br/>
some parents think that 10 yo&#39;s don&#39;t need the same<br/>
amt of patience, love, support, etc that a newborn or<br/>
two yo needs?  <br/>
<br/>
Then we wonder why teenagerhood is so hard?  I think<br/>
it&#39;s because kids feel betrayed and ignored, and<br/>
overreact with this false, early, independence.  Well,<br/>
looking back, that was my experience, anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I think part of it is some misplaced need to toughen<br/>
them up, make them grow up faster, push them out of<br/>
the nest, I don&#39;t know.   Is it possible it&#39;s<br/>
instinct, from the days when kids this age are soon to<br/>
be parents, and have families and homes of their own?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How interesting to read this!  It was very similar in my household growing <br/>
up.  I was the youngest of 4 and when I came to about 11 yo my mother also <br/>
suddenly &#39;changed&#39;.  Suddenly I was allowed NO freedom, had strict rules and <br/>
consequences etc etc.  In reaction to this adbrupt turn around, I rebelled <br/>
ferociously.  I became angry, hurt, and did everything I could to act the exact <br/>
opposite of how I had been before this time.  My parents could not understand.  And <br/>
amusingly, I would tell them EXACTLY why I did what I was doing, and they <br/>
couldn&#39;t get it.  They would say stuff such as, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve already been through 3 <br/>
other teenagers, we won&#39;t have things the same with you, so we&#39;re buckling <br/>
down on you now&quot;  HA!!  I wouldn&#39;t never acting as horribly as I did, had they <br/>
simply continued to treat me with the same love and respect as they had up <br/>
until I turned 12.  They never even gave me the benefit of the doubt to see how <br/>
I&#39;d be after puberty.  They assummed I&#39;d be the same as my sister and brothers, <br/>
and punished me before the bad behavior ever even had a chance to happen or <br/>
not happen.<br/>
