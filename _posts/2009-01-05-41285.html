<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715383412">Ha, from one of my favourite designers on Project Runway, no less! I  <br/>
remember seeing an episode from her home. It was totally kid-friendly  <br/>
with things hanging from the ceiling to swing on and she seemed  <br/>
completely comfortable with lots of noise and action from her boys.  <br/>
Her take on the food thing doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055476775">That was a cool article!  What always amuses me about articles like<br/>
that, are the comments.  Wow!  I mean, I know such people exist, we live<br/>
in the same neighborhood with a few food controllers, but I guess in my<br/>
own little reality, I really believed that it was more uncommon than<br/>
common.  I guess it depends on where one lives and the general economics<br/>
of the area and what kind of stores the area supports.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of &quot;healthy, organic is better than anything else&quot;<br/>
eaters in our area of the Pacific NW, after all it is home to many from<br/>
the hippy era, my parents included, even though they live in NM now!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the big scare stuff that bothers me more than anything when it<br/>
comes to anything food related.  Making any food big and scary just<br/>
seems more harmful than the eating of those foods.</div>
