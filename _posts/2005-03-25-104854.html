<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697416981">I couldn&#39;t find the original bit to quote, but there was a question about  <br/>
priorities that was swept away.<br/>
 <br/>
The reason it&#39;s important for a mom to decide which of any two things is  <br/>
more important is that it makes decision making easy and sensible.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people put formal education VERY high on their list, and so for them  <br/>
it&#39;s crucial that their children go to good schools, regularly, with great  <br/>
supplies and a desk at home at which to do homework, etc.  Because they  KNOW that <br/>
thing is worth their time and money.  It might be worth more to  them than a <br/>
good relationship with their kids, because they figure if the kids  get a <br/>
scholarship and a great job that makes big bucks that they&#39;ll appreciate  that and <br/>
forgive whatever means it took to justify that ends, eventually.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a way to live and it&#39;s prevalent in this culture, and it&#39;s  <br/>
understandable.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people put religion first on their list.  They will do what they  think <br/>
God wants done, no matter if it means moving to another continent and  never <br/>
seeing their parents again, or selling their house and land and giving  that <br/>
money to the church and becoming a nun, or spanking their kids and ignoring  <br/>
their tears, because they think souls and eternity are WAY more important than  <br/>
anything elst whatsoever.  And so their decisionmaking is easy.<br/>
 <br/>
IF a person has decided that living with their children respectfully and  <br/>
openly and freely, helping them learn to make choices at an early age, helping  <br/>
them have opportunities to learn without pressure and textbooks and required  <br/>
writing and disability lables, then that will be more important to them than  <br/>
what the neighbors think or the idea of having a college scholarship by the age <br/>
 of 17, or having the best behaved kids at church.<br/>
 <br/>
People who don&#39;t know what their priorities are will have a harder time  <br/>
making simple everyday decisions, and will have a hard time justifying them and  <br/>
sticking with them once they&#39;re made.  People who aren&#39;t committed to  <br/>
unschooling might see it as iffy and questionable and not too important.<br/>
 <br/>
This list, though, is for those who ARE committed to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
There are other lists to be found with google searches or yahoogroups &quot;find  <br/>
a list&quot; search, and some other unschooling lists linked here: <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other_">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other)">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other)</a> <br/>
but those who have radical unschooling and respectful parenting as high  <br/>
priorities are on this list to discuss those ideas, not to explain them over and  <br/>
over to people who resist understanding them.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not easy for the moderators to decide what to let through and what to  <br/>
send back.<br/>
It&#39;s not easy for moderators to guess who would really start to understand  <br/>
unschooling it if they stayed another few days or who should be encouraged to  <br/>
find another place to go.<br/>
 <br/>
Just wanted to work that into the idea of priorities.  Some  listowners&#39; <br/>
priorities might be to try to make all list members equally welcome  and <br/>
comfortable, but I doubt they succeed much.  On a list with way over a  thousand <br/>
members, it&#39;s best for us to stick to our topic and our policies when  we&#39;re in <br/>
doubt.<br/>
 <br/>
Policies are here, in case anyone wants to review them:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859657625">We are unschoolers and proud of it. I am so happy that we have made <br/>
our priorities to live in freedom. I share this with everyone who <br/>
asks why my kids are not in school, or if we &quot;homeschool&quot;. If <br/>
someone seems interested I will explain it to them, but I don&#39;t feel <br/>
I am too outspoken about it. I am content with how we live and I <br/>
don&#39;t feel the need for anyone&#39;s approval. I have had people tell <br/>
me, even some unschoolers, that I should not announce that we <br/>
unschool because I could draw a lot of unwanted negative attention <br/>
to our family. I wonder what other unschoolers on this list think <br/>
about this.....just curious.<br/>
