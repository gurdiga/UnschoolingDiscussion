You assume that the dissenting voices (me) haven&#39;t done the reading and  made <br/>
a shift in conventional thought, or don&#39;t really understand it.  I  have, <br/>
had, and do, and I reject it as the whole  philosophy for my  parenting, but put <br/>
some of the principles in practice on a daily  basis.   Unlike people who say <br/>
they &quot;unschool except for math&quot;, I  don&#39;t go around saying I&#39;m a TCS/NCParent. <br/>
 That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t  understand the concept.<br/>

As there&#39;s nothing in the radical unschooling-extended-to-parenting that&#39;s <br/>
anything LIKE &quot;do what I say,&quot; then what do you see would be a benefit of <br/>
radical unschoolers studying TCS closer?  If we&#39;re already living it, why read <br/>

can understand choosing to spend time and energy on unschooling <br/>

term non-coercive parenting could have negative connotations to <br/>
someone who is wholly unschooling (batman!).  To me when you take it <br/>
beyond your approach to your children&#39;s education...it becomes a <br/>
parenting thing not a schooling thing.  And to say something like <br/>
radical unschooling extended to parenting to me is to go out of your <br/>
way not to use the term non-coercive parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason it was being suggested that some of the people <br/>
expressing opinions on the subject didn&#39;t fully understand TCS, was <br/>
because of the things being said like (not quoting here...going from <br/>
memory)....tcs parents have to let kids do whatever they want without <br/>
regard to their own or others feelings....trying to persuade a friend <br/>
to stop drinking the day before a big interview would be a tcs no-<br/>
no....etc. are just flat-out wrong based on everything I have read <br/>
and absorbed over the last 2 years (though I realize 2 yrs makes me a <br/>
novice in the company of many of you!).<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record,  I&#39;m not lobbying for the people here to call <br/>
this kind of unschooling NCP.  I don&#39;t care what you call it, I&#39;m <br/>
just glad you&#39;re all here for me to learn from!!!  The only reason I <br/>
brought this up was that it felt to me like everyone in the room was <br/>
looking at an elephant and saying...what should we call it??....let&#39;s <br/>
call it an un-hippo!  or radically un-hippo? or wholly un-hippo?  <br/>
And, I am sitting here thinking....ummm..hasn&#39;t anyone every heard <br/>
of...elephant?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because when my 2 year old climbed up onto a nice coffee table and <br/>
began to dance on it, at somebody&#39;s very lovely decorated house, I <br/>
gently removed her and found her something else to do that was fun for <br/>
her and didn&#39;t involve destruction of other people&#39;s property.<br/>
<br/>
And when Sandra and I and Holly (who was about 6 years old or so) were <br/>
running late for catching our airplane after the Mindful (Rethinking <br/>
Education) Conference some years ago, Holly didn&#39;t want to leave but we <br/>
insisted. We did it nicely, we explained the situation, we sympathized <br/>
with her not wanting to go and leave her new friends, but we didn&#39;t let <br/>
her reticence be the deciding factor that made us miss our plane. We <br/>
did NOT open up the decision to all possibilities and we didn&#39;t offer <br/>
our theories and work on creative problem solving until we could come <br/>
to a mutually agreeable solution. We, the two adults in the situation, <br/>
who knew and understood what the repercussions would be of any or all <br/>
of us missing that plane, put our greater understanding and information <br/>
above her immediate desire to stay with her two new friends (who were <br/>
hysterically crying and hanging on to her and making it nearly <br/>
impossible for Holly to think clearly enough to make a reasonable <br/>
decision even within her limited understand and information).<br/>
<br/>
These would be unacceptable behaviors to NCPers. I&#39;m just not willing <br/>
to go as far as they do - so I&#39;m NOT saying that NCP is the same as the <br/>
kind of trusting unschooling that we talk about here.<br/>
<br/>
NCP says that when a mutually-acceptable solution can&#39;t be found, the <br/>
priority becomes &quot;not coercing the child.&quot; I understand the reasoning. <br/>
I think it sounds great in theory and that its one huge big <br/>
(theoretical) error is not accounting for the unfortunate reality of <br/>
time constraints and that its secondary error is not accounting <br/>
adequately for differences in parents and children in ability to <br/>
understand consequences and to comprehend information.<br/>
<br/>
Not coercing is &quot;a&quot; priority for me, but not the ultimate priority.<br/>
<br/>
I also thought there was a small amount of hypocrisy evident - or maybe <br/>
double-talk. For example, if a young child runs into the street and is <br/>
about to be hit by a car, TCS/NCP people didn&#39;t have a problem with <br/>
somebody else swooping them up and out of harm&#39;s way. Their reasoning <br/>
was that the child didn&#39;t want to be hit by a car so this doesn&#39;t count <br/>
as coercion.<br/>
<br/>
So - the argument is that if the child really understood he/she was <br/>
about to be hit by a car, he/she would want to be moved.<br/>
<br/>
This argument could be used for anything - I could say that if Holly <br/>
really understood the repercussions of us missing our plane, she would <br/>
have wanted us to make it. I could say that if my 2 year old really <br/>
understood the repercussions of her dancing on the neighbor&#39;s coffee <br/>
table, she&#39;d want to be stopped. A damaged table or missed airplane <br/>
connections aren&#39;t life-threatening - but the logic is the same.<br/>

 <br/>
Right.  And millions of parents think that their children don&#39;t  understand <br/>
the repurcussions of not making good grades in school and  practicing the piano <br/>
so they force them to go and all that.  It&#39;s a  continuum.<br/>
 <br/>
My entry to the parenting continuum/cycle is from loving, mindful  <br/>
consideration of their feelings and comfort, and the knowledge that  they can learn from <br/>
playing.  That&#39;s my starting point and my fallback  point.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone else&#39;s basepoint is non-coercion, that&#39;s fine for them.<br/>
 <br/>
Some other people&#39;s basepoints are &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; or &quot;academic excellence&quot;  or <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t lose grandpa&#39;s approval because he has six million dollars we could  <br/>
inherit.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Some people&#39;s basepoints are &quot;I don&#39;t want to think about it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m coercive, but I have been assured in public by someone  who <br/>
was a prominent representative of NCP that I was absolutely  coercive.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t change how my children have learned, and her  opinion didn&#39;t harm my <br/>
relationship with them.  They never even heard of  the discussion.<br/>
 <br/>
Today I was telling Kirby about a letter I got (on paper, not e-mail,  so I <br/>
couldn&#39;t just forward it to him) thanking our whole family for  helping the <br/>
author&#39;s family live more peacefully. It was a thanks for our  sharing our lives <br/>
in public for others&#39; benefit.  Kirby just shrugged and  smiled.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
mind that lots of people know the details of his  life.  He knows our life is <br/>
better in many ways than the homelives of  other friends of his.  If anyone <br/>
else&#39;s life can be better because of  things I&#39;ve written, he&#39;s all for that.<br/>
 <br/>
By the stated principles of the other philosophies being promoted here, I  <br/>
would have violated his privacy and been disrespectful of him, as he was too  <br/>
young to agree to have his life made an example. <br/>
 <br/>
But he&#39;s known since he knew anything that other moms were nursing  because <br/>
we had helped.  He knew since he was &quot;school age&quot; that the  details of his not <br/>
going to school were public record.  He hasn&#39;t  objected.<br/>

(OK, Pam said it better, but I&#39;ll toss in my agreement to her points.)<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself to be &quot;minimally coercive&quot;.  I really want to help <br/>
James get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
I do not, however, accept as *my* goal the goal of being 100% <br/>
non-coercive.  And when difficult situations arise I will sometimes use <br/>
my parent power and finish a planning discussion with &quot;I need you to get <br/>
in the car.&quot;  (If this weren&#39;t so hypothetical or homogenized, I&#39;d be <br/>
able to type in the explanation that I had given, which I would probably <br/>
state again, after the &quot;... get in the car&quot; part.)  When something is <br/>
really important to me for whatever reason, and James is vaguely against <br/>
whatever participation I would need from him, I don&#39;t automatically go <br/>
along with *his* choice.  (I don&#39;t automatically go along with *my* <br/>
first choice, either.)  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to think of this <br/>
outcome as a &quot;failure&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I subscribed to the TCS list for two weeks (about 5 years ago) and <br/>
only a small percentage of the people on that list behaved in owards <br/>
other adults in a manner that I would ever wish to emulate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102513421">Thank you, Pam for writing this lengthy explanation.  My dh and I <br/>
were discussing this list and the things I have read here.  He and I <br/>
both are coming around; or at least re-thinking some things.  I <br/>
could only speculate about answers for some of his questions, but I <br/>
think this will help him as it has helped me greatly.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I have been discussing lately the idea of respecting a <br/>
child because they are as much human as you and I are.  They have <br/>
all the elements they will ever need to become an adult (they will <br/>
never aquire more intellect, emotions, etc.) and therefore should be <br/>
respected as one.  However, as you pointed out, children don&#39;t have <br/>
the maturity to understand the consequences to some of their actions <br/>
and, at times, we have to step in and gently require them to do what <br/>
needs to be done.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were speculating that when you only tell your child &quot;no&quot; <br/>
when it is absolutely necessary they are more likely to know that <br/>
there is a good reason for it.  Are we on the right track?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so.<br/>
<br/>
There are parenting books that more or less say that kids need and want <br/>
to be controlled because it makes them feel loved.<br/>
<br/>
Think about that - do we want our kids to grow up equating control and <br/>
power with being loved?<br/>
<br/>
NO child starts out life wanting to be controlled and overpowered - <br/>
which is what coercion feels like.<br/>
<br/>
But - we all want some protection and care taken with us EVEN when <br/>
we&#39;re grown up. Children DO want to feel cared for and safe, along with <br/>
other things like trusted, and listened to, and supported, encouraged, <br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have to use judgment. Parenting isn&#39;t a science, it is a human <br/>
endeavor. We use successive approximations to learn how to parent our <br/>
particular kids - we won&#39;t &quot;get it right&quot;- not perfectly right very <br/>
much of the time, but we can get better and better by simply making a <br/>
&quot;better&quot; choice as often as we can.<br/>
<br/>
And, in my opinion, occasionally the best choice we will be able to <br/>
come up with will be something like, &quot;We need to go now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  As an adult with access to far more information and far more <br/>
experience and far more ability to anticipate consequences, there will <br/>
be times when I make decisions and my kids will be asked to simply go <br/>
along with those decisions without full understanding and agreement on <br/>
their part.  Sometimes, as the parent, I&#39;m a little like a tour guide. <br/>
I&#39;m not their &quot;boss&quot; - but they all realize that me making some of the <br/>
logistical decisions and expecting the rest of the family to go along <br/>
with them without argument will make everybody&#39;s life smoother and <br/>
happier. So they do. If they feel strongly about something, they know <br/>
that they&#39;ll be listened to and respected.<br/>

I&#39;m  not their &quot;boss&quot; - but they all realize that me making some of the  <br/>
logistical decisions and expecting the rest of the family to go along  <br/>
with them without argument will make everybody&#39;s life smoother and  <br/>
happier. So they do. If they feel strongly about something, they know  <br/>

 <br/>
Now that my kids are all old enough to opt out of activities, I&#39;ve noticed  <br/>
that usually an activity centers on one person.  We went with Kirby to  school <br/>
when he was getting an award for something and didn&#39;t know what it  was.  <br/>
(Turned out to be a certificate for Exceptional Performance, and  because it was <br/>
his first ever academic recognition in his whole life, it was  cool that we <br/>
went.)  That day, it was Kirby&#39;s deal.  Whoever hurried  up to be on time did it <br/>
for Kirby.  They dressed up and went because they  had agreed to.<br/>
 <br/>
Tuesday I was doing a presentation for 7th grade history students on the  <br/>
history of English, in a friend&#39;s classroom.  Holly went last year and  wanted to <br/>
go again.  Our friend Vincent King has applied to attend that  school next <br/>
year (Sandia Academy) so we invited Vincent.  Holly got up and  got ready <br/>
because she had agreed to do something I needed to do.<br/>
 <br/>
When kids have a choice to go or not, their willingness to cooperate when  <br/>
they DO want to go is a whole different thing than when they&#39;re being *once  <br/>
again* dragged somewhere against their will.  But when the kids were  little, I <br/>
would persuade them to help me out in exchange for doing something of  their <br/>
choice and design later that day or another day.   I never said  &quot;Do it because <br/>
I&#39;m the mom and I said so.&quot;   <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I persuade them to go, sometimes they persuade me not to  go.  I go <br/>
to movies with Marty and Kirby sometimes that I didn&#39;t really  think I wanted <br/>
to go to, and they do the same for me.  Usually we end up  liking the outing <br/>
and the movie both.<br/>

 <br/>
Kirby took a lower score in his college skills class than he could&#39;ve  <br/>
because he consciously decided not to do an assignment that required writing one  <br/>
full-sentence summary of each chapter in the textbook.  Kirby used  one of the <br/>
principles the teacher had discussed early in the semester to  justify this.  <br/>
He told the teacher &quot;I decided it wasn&#39;t a piano,&quot; meaning  it wasn&#39;t the sort <br/>
of thing that needed the precision that tuning a piano  needed.<br/>
 <br/>
The guy just laughed and said, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It wasn&#39;t a matter of not getting credit for the class.  It was  between a <br/>
high B and a low A, and that didn&#39;t show on the CR/NC final mark  anyway.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068157747">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My dh and I were speculating that when you only tell your child &quot;no&quot;<br/>
when it is absolutely necessary they are more likely to know that<br/>
there is a good reason for it.  Are we on the right track?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would add to this the idea, that the &quot;good reasons&quot; have to be<br/>
communicated to the kids also - especially while the trust is building. It<br/>
is all very well for the parent to believe the reason is good, but if the<br/>
kids don&#39;t agree or at least understand why the parents hold the belief,<br/>
then the end result is still *feeling* coerced and controlled. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just articulating what we feel is a &quot;good&quot; reason, ends up<br/>
illuminating that the reason is actually arbitrary or just &quot;ok&quot; instead of<br/>
actually &quot;good&quot;. The definition of &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; constantly slides<br/>
as our paradigm shifts.<br/>

understood - but it bears repeating over and over.<br/>
<br/>
So - the problem that remains is that the reasons are often so <br/>
complicated and we adults just have the whole thing, like a big gestalt <br/>
thought, in our heads - getting it out articulately enough for the kids <br/>
is hard - some aspects of the reason may not even be intelligible to a <br/>
child. &quot;You know - I really feel like we need to leave right now for <br/>
the airport - I really don&#39;t want to miss this plane, it&#39;ll be a lot of <br/>
trouble - like paying for another flight, trying to get a refund <br/>
(they&#39;ll charge us something to change tickets - not sure how much), <br/>
people are already planning to pick us up and it&#39;ll be rude to change <br/>
their plans and maybe they can&#39;t change their plans so we&#39;ll have to <br/>
find another way home and maybe pay for a shuttle which will be another <br/>
$100 or more. And, maybe we could wait 15 minutes more but it is <br/>
getting close to rush hour and if we don&#39;t leave now, it&#39;ll be rush <br/>
hour and there is a chance that the traffic will hold us up and we&#39;ll <br/>
miss the plane, plus I have to return the rental car and if I don&#39;t get <br/>
it back on time it&#39;ll cost us for another whole day - but I can&#39;t quite <br/>
remember what time it was supposed to be back and I&#39;d really rather <br/>
just go now and not have to figure that out and .....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How do you explain all this to a young child who just wants to keep <br/>
playing with her friends?<br/>
<br/>
It is almost always under time constraints that joint creative problem <br/>
solving breaks down - parents can&#39;t think clearly EITHER under a time <br/>
crunch - so the first thing is to try to avoid having these discussions <br/>
under such pressure. But, it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Without time constraints, we could do everything everybody wants - no <br/>
choices would really have to be made other than in what order to do <br/>
things. Not real life, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223990901">I just wanted to give a picture of my experiences with the tcs/ncp <br/>
community, since Sandra and Pam have posted their experiences and <br/>
mine (I think) differ considerably.  If you are tired of this <br/>
subject, and just want me to shut up...please just skip this post!<br/>
<br/>
This (below) is from a post to the TCS list...could have been <br/>
another tcs group or board, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was on &quot;the&quot; <br/>
list....and I don&#39;t know who the poster was, I just saved it because <br/>
I thought it was nice and succinct (hope its not a no-no to post <br/>
this without author&#39;s name attached and/or without author&#39;s <br/>

Okay, you have a conflict with a loved one. You can: <br/>
<br/>
1. Get your way. There are numerous methods of manipulation or <br/>
force. <br/>
<br/>
2. Give in. This is a good road to resentment. <br/>
<br/>
3. Find a solution you both like. This may mean you see a solution <br/>
that is <br/>
DIFFERENT than what you wanted originally, but is better. <br/>
<br/>
Rethink the whole issue. Rethink everything. Go with number 3. <br/>
<br/>
You will fail. Often. Every time you give in, you will chip away at <br/>
your <br/>
relationship and model doormat behavior. Every time you manipulate <br/>
or <br/>
force, you will chip away at your relationship and model bullying. <br/>
Every <br/>
time you find a solution you both like, you will strengthen your <br/>
relationship and model conflict resolution. <br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>
(back to me) <br/>
In the tcs/ncp discussions that I have read and/or been a part of <br/>
the ideal of a completely non-coercive relationship is held out as <br/>
just that...an ideal...something that they believe is possible and <br/>
strive for.  When they fail, they don&#39;t beat each other up about it, <br/>
they may come to the forum and say...hey here&#39;s an area where I <br/>
often get stuck (meaning...find myself resorting to coercion)...help <br/>
me out...what am I not seeing (something in my past that is getting <br/>
in my way, a fresh set of options/alternatives/ideas, something that <br/>
could have been done earlier to avoid the situation all together).  <br/>
<br/>
While they would disagree with someone using scenarios like the 2 <br/>
Pam posted (great examples!) to assert that....see coercion in some <br/>
cases is both necessary and good/right. I have often seen people <br/>
post similar scenarios saying....whew...here&#39;s what I <br/>
did....couldn&#39;t see another way...it was the least bad alternative <br/>
in the moment....help me out, what would you have done??  So, while <br/>
they do view resorting to coercion as a failure, what that means to <br/>
me is that each time you find yourself resorting to coercion, you <br/>
are aware of it, and process it...as in, what can I learn from that <br/>
and what might I be able to do to avoid it next time.  Just because <br/>
it is the least bad thing you can come up with to do, doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it good/optimum.  But, just because it is less than optimum, doesn&#39;t <br/>
make it evil either!  Often the suggestions I read are things that <br/>
could have been done before the conflict arose...very often in <br/>
fact....so I take those kinds of suggestions as admission that the <br/>
poster may very well have done the same if things got to the point <br/>
where you were....but that the goal (ideal) is not to get there.  <br/>
Hind sight being 20/20 and all.<br/>
<br/>
I am not posting this to sell anyone on anything.  I just felt self <br/>
conscious thinking that people on this list might assume that I am <br/>
advocating or condoning the kind of thinking and behaving that Pam, <br/>
Sandra and others have experienced in the past from tcs-ers.  I&#39;m <br/>
not.  I think that sucked.  And, while I have read some posts to the <br/>
tcs list that were in a similar vein, during my time reading in tcs <br/>
circles those have been few and far between.  I just pay attention <br/>
to the voices that I find valuable, helpful or thought provoking and <br/>
ignore the rest.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s impossible for people to read the writings of the radical unschoolers  <br/>
who are active on this list (and wherever they might&#39;ve written in the past)  <br/>
without being steeped in the idea of thinking out of the box, or being mindful  <br/>
and aware of new solutions and to avoid kneejerk bad mainstream responses.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-You will fail. Often. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
This is a big difference.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone is being advised to make the best choice available to her within  <br/>
what she knows and can do, then she will succeed.  Often.  Every time  she <br/>
makes a better choice, she succeeds.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not just kids who do better feeling successful.  Success breeds  <br/>
success, because feeling capable becomes BEING capable.  Confidence and  experience <br/>
build on one another, and when the goal is to become the best one can  be <br/>
gradually (maybe quickly, but still in graduated steps), I think probably  THAT <br/>
method creates more success and more happiness than any absolute goal  people are <br/>
told in advance that they will fail to meet.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Every time you manipulate <br/>
or force, you will chip away at your  relationship and model bullying. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Radical unschoolers don&#39;t advocate or condone manipulation or  forcing.<br/>
Joyful living and communication are not manipulation.  If I&#39;m  ecstatically <br/>
happy with my husband and will do lots of things just to make him  happy, I <br/>
think some cynical and negative people might say he had manipulated me  by making <br/>
me love him. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t much like cynicism and  negativity.  When people <br/>
have a choice between something negative and  something positive, they succeed <br/>
when they choose the positive.  And the  next time they make a choice they can <br/>
make an even BETTER choice.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Every time you find a solution you both like, you will strengthen your  <br/>
relationship and model conflict resolution. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I have never in my life ever seen better advice about relationship building  <br/>
than the respectful parenting advice given by the radical unschoolers  here.  <br/>
Never in a religious context, never in a family counseling context,  never <br/>
anywhere.<br/>
 <br/>
To me it seems that NCP requires looking at the child through rules-colored  <br/>
glasses, and by what you&#39;ve brought as a good example, looking at the child  <br/>
through &quot;I will fail&quot; colored glasses.  I don&#39;t see any advantage to  that.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-When they fail, they don&#39;t beat each other up about it, <br/>

in my way, a fresh set of  options/alternatives/ideas, something that <br/>
could have been done earlier to  avoid the situation all together).  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If they could state the whole thing in terms or principles rather than one  <br/>
overriding unreachable RULE, they wouldn&#39;t be stuck, and they would be seeing  <br/>
much more.<br/>
 <br/>
-=While they would disagree with someone using scenarios like the 2 <br/>
Pam  posted (great examples!) to assert that....see coercion in some <br/>
cases is  both necessary and good/right. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t see coercion in either case.  Humans are humans many real,  <br/>
immediate human needs don&#39;t fit anyone&#39;s template of ideal interactions.   Coercion is <br/>
a real word and a real concept bigger, older and more real than any  <br/>
contrived interpretation of it.  There&#39;s more coercion in trying to get  strangers to <br/>
agree to a made-up definition of coercion than there was in our  getting Holly <br/>
into the shuttle bus that day to come home from Dallas.   Holly didn&#39;t fail.  <br/>
Pam and and I didn&#39;t fail.  We did the best thing  we could have done under <br/>
the circumstances, and Holly was happier sleeping next  to us than she was <br/>
participating in a crying fit in the lobby of a hotel with  people she hasn&#39;t seen <br/>
since.  We didn&#39;t model bullying or coercion.   We modelled responsibility <br/>
and compassion.  <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Seeing things in terms of what is the most good alternative is profoundly  <br/>
better than defining one&#39;s life in terms of the least bad.  Here&#39;s how  <br/>
different it is:  One can be standing out in the middle of a field with the  sun <br/>
shining.  One can turn toward the sun or away from the sun without  leaving that <br/>
physical spot on the earth.  Turning toward good and away from  bad is not a <br/>
failure.  Choosing among bad choices is failure every time,  you say?  <br/>
 <br/>
Turn away from that.<br/>
 <br/>
-=Just because <br/>
it is the least bad thing you can come up with to do,  doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it good/optimum.  But, just because it is less than  optimum, doesn&#39;t <br/>
make it evil either! -=-<br/>
 <br/>
It makes it bad.<br/>
If less than optimum is always failure, those people are wallowing in  <br/>
failure.<br/>
That can come to no good.<br/>
 <br/>
-=Often the suggestions I read are things that <br/>

 <br/>
Nothing you wrote made me cranky except that last paragraph.<br/>
Now I think you should drop the topic and spend many hours reading what  <br/>
people HAVE advised about how people should live with their children, and how to  <br/>
handle conflicts, and how to have peaceful homes and safe learning nests.<br/>

 <br/>
So you ARE trying to sell it as a reasonable thing to have advocated  or to <br/>
have suggested that we study further.  You&#39;re trying to convince us  that it <br/>
was reasonable to have suggested that we just didn&#39;t understand it very  well.  <br/>

<br/>
I have to say that this approach to parenting is exactly what exhausted me <br/>
completely when I was in an NVC frame of mind - I felt like I was constantly <br/>
not getting it right, constantly not reaching my goals, with no hope in <br/>
sight because real life did not proceed so linearly as to achieve a solution <br/>
in real time that satisfied 4 very different opinions.<br/>
<br/>
It was the constant &quot;failing&quot; attitude or beliefs that did not bring more <br/>
peace/harmony in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Within minutes  of really settling in to looking at my child through his/her <br/>
eyes, I can find compassion, empathy, understanding, and most of all, love <br/>
for their personhood that was never possible when my number one goal was to <br/>
not coerce.<br/>
<br/>
 From this list,  (as well as from leaving NVC behind as my number one goal, <br/>
as well as striving to never operate from any &quot;shoulds&quot; )my number one goal <br/>
has become to really understand a child, to really embrace their desires as <br/>
pure and perfect and important, to get to know them better, but not to <br/>
obsess over whether coersion is involved at every moment in time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133149774">Way too harsh for my taste. Incredibly guilt-producing. Guaranteed to <br/>
be guilt-producing. Parenting is hard enough without thinking that <br/>
every single time we say, &quot;You know what, sweetheart, I&#39;ve explained <br/>
what will happen if we don&#39;t leave now, we haven&#39;t come up with an <br/>
alternative that will work, and if we take any more time, right now, to <br/>
talk about it, we&#39;ll miss the plane, so let&#39;s get going,&quot; that we&#39;re <br/>
being bullies.<br/>
<br/>
A parent who has just done a GOOD job - someone who has spoken <br/>
respectfully to their children, who has listened to the child&#39;s point <br/>
of view, who has truly thought about whether or not there are possibly <br/>
workable alternatives, and who is making a decision knowing that the <br/>
child doesn&#39;t have the capacity to fully anticipate the consequences of <br/>
doing nothing, now gets told that they&#39;ve manipulated or forced so <br/>
they&#39;re chipping away at their relationship and modeling bullying.<br/>
<br/>
This is a FAR cry from bullying and to call it a failure and to equate <br/>
it with manipulation and bullying is EXACTLY what turns me off to <br/>
NCP/TCS.<br/>

That perfectly illustrates the assumption that if mutual agreement <br/>
isn&#39;t found then it is the adult who always must give in because to <br/>
expect the child to give in, EVER, is to &quot;manipulate and bully.&quot; Oh - <br/>
but the adult never calls it &quot;giving in&quot; because that would make them a <br/>
doormat - so they call it deciding not to coerce and, presumably, since <br/>
it is the adult decision, it isn&#39;t really &quot;giving in.&quot;<br/>

OH right! <br/>
This reminds me of another objection to their rhetoric.<br/>
It&#39;s illogical nonsense.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t respect people who can&#39;t just use English straight out to  <br/>
communicate with other English speakers.  Saying &quot;When I say couch I mean  anything <br/>
people sit on&quot; is the end of the conversation for me.  Let&#39;s use  real words in <br/>
real ways.  To do otherwise seems an flashing indicator of  lack of <br/>
truth/honesty/sense.<br/>
