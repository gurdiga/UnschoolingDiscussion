<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074721489"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Now, with your post, it all begins to feel natural again!  I can &#39;teach&#39; <br/>
&gt;&gt;Em to cook since she loves it!).  I can &#39;teach&#39; her how a plant can grow <br/>
&gt;&gt;from a seed (since she&#39;s curious)!  And when she asks, I can teach her <br/>
&gt;&gt;what different sounds letters make.  I really didn&#39;t like being paranoid <br/>
&gt;&gt;of using that word....teach : )&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No need to be paranoid. :o) Of course you&#39;re teaching your little one all <br/>
about the world. That&#39;s what we parents do. But I doubt your&#39;re sitting her <br/>
down and insisting she follow a cooking or plant life or (hopefully) reading <br/>
curriculum. That&#39;s the kind of usage or connection to the word teaching that <br/>
we try to stay away from here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Getting back to phonics books....Have you heard anything about Reading <br/>
&gt;&gt;Reflex?  It&#39;s a&#39;new(?) method of phonics where there are no rules to <br/>
&gt;&gt;learn...and they use terms like &#39;sound pictures&#39; (the letters that <br/>
&gt;&gt;represent the sounds in words).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow. Your daughter is only 3 right? Have you tried the old (and inexpensive) <br/>
letters on the fridge like Ned suggested? I haven&#39;t seen Reading Reflex, but <br/>
I know Conor really understood letter sounds using pictures instead of just <br/>
letters. But I would think that could be accomplished by just cutting out <br/>
pictures from a magazine and sticking them on an index card. For example, a <br/>
picture of a carrot on one side/a &quot;c&quot; on the other. A picture of an apple/an <br/>
&quot;a&quot;. A picture of a top/a &quot;t&quot;. Put carrot/apple/top together and the 3 <br/>
starting sounds are c-a-t. If your daughter is enjoying it and asking <br/>
questions about letters and sounds, this could be a fun game.<br/>
<br/>
I was also remembering that computer games were another fun learning tool. <br/>
Games like the early Jump Starts (K-grade 3) were my kids favorites. (After <br/>
that they got too schooly for them.) Reader Rabbit, Arthur&#39;s Reading Race, <br/>
etc. were all fun.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
