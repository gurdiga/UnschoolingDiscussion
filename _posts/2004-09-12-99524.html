<br/>
we joined an inclusive group when we lived in the city and out of the three <br/>
hundred families we found about 10 with which we connected. when we moved to <br/>
the country we couldn&#39;t find a group that was even a particle fit. when we <br/>
found out that one of the families that we connected with in the city had <br/>
also moved to our new area we  started our own group (it took about 3 years <br/>
to find enough interest). it started with 6 families. i don&#39;t think we have <br/>
more than 15 now. if you can&#39;t find a gruop that works for you, then start <br/>
your own. you never know how many people out there in your area are at a <br/>
loss and looking for something like what you are looking for. when you start <br/>
your own group you can define what your looking for and the people who are <br/>
looking for the same will show interest.<br/>
maybe if you build it they will come.<br/>

<br/>
Tolerance seems to be an admirable trait, yet, to me<br/>
it means I have to bite my tongue a lot.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of difference in being in a Discussion group where radical<br/>
ideas are strongly debated, and being amongst a bunch of other mothers in a<br/>
public place like a park, where no-one is doing anything especially unkind<br/>
or abusive to their kids -  just talking about the reading readiness program<br/>
they are planning to use, or sharing websites and organizing trips to<br/>
museums.<br/>
<br/>
I bite my tongue by walking away. I don&#39;t get into curriculum conversations.<br/>
I also avoid any discussions of religion. If someone starts going on about<br/>
how they &quot;have to&quot; limit TV, I shrug and tell them that Jayn is free to<br/>
watch anything she wants any time, and that she doesn&#39;t crave it, and that<br/>
it is a choice that the parents are making. Jayn sure doesn&#39;t seem to spend<br/>
her time talking to the other kids about TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people evidently feel superior to me because they are taking a<br/>
strong stance against for example candies (gasp), but their feelings will<br/>
make no change in how we live. Also it is really rare to have differences<br/>
canvassed in a heated manner at our group. I always say that Jayn can eat<br/>
whatever she wants whenever she wants. They look at me with evident<br/>
suspicion, and then they hear Jayn say &quot;no thanks&quot; to a cookie and ask for<br/>
an apple and they look perplexed.<br/>
<br/>
One usually nice woman was impinging on her child&#39;s enjoyment by being what<br/>
I saw as quite pissy about the kid getting her feet wet. I didn&#39;t use that<br/>
rude word to her, but I did say something about how Jayn loved getting wet<br/>
any time. The other mother didn&#39;t have another pair of shoes with her, BUT<br/>
she told me that was deliberate because she doesn&#39;t like having to &quot;deal<br/>
with&quot; wet feet. Naturally Jayn was already soaking at the same park. <br/>
<br/>
I related to her the story of how Jayn wanted to play squirt bottles with<br/>
ice water with me some nights before, so we each filled a bottle with water<br/>
from the fridge, and went into the bathroom in our clothes and squirted each<br/>
other and the mirror with great enjoyment (and some discomfort - brrr) for<br/>
about half an hour before getting out of our sopping garments and having a<br/>
warm bath. She did look at me like I was kinda nuts, but maybe that story<br/>
would have her thinking of the relative ease of wet feet or shoes, and how<br/>
simple willingness to be inconvenienced can end up creating a wonderful<br/>
memory.<br/>
<br/>
If the support groups are not play-focused - by which I mean that they have<br/>
regularly scheduled park days where the kids just play freely together -<br/>
then they must be focused on something else. If that is academic classes it<br/>
may not be a supportive environment for an Unschooler. If that is craft<br/>
activities, beware of the thin edge of the wedge - and a lot depends on the<br/>
personality of the activity leader. <br/>
<br/>
If it is group outings to places, maybe only choose to go on the &quot;field<br/>
trips&quot; (schoolish language :P~) that are of interest to your kids, and be<br/>
aware that the host of the museum (or whatever) will probably treat the<br/>
group as if they were school kids, with clipboards of special (often dumb)<br/>
activities to be completed, and a set agenda. It makes a difference to have<br/>
a high ratio of parents to kids, however, especially when the parents are<br/>
just as interested as the kids in the bugs or bones or exploding soda cans<br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If the focus is religious education or discussion, then that is a decision<br/>
the parents must debate themselves. Be aware that many of the religious<br/>
groups state openly that they are there to support the correct use of<br/>
religiously based academic curricula, especially in the sciences. If you are<br/>
*looking* for that you are probably not an Unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
My purpose in being a member of a local group is first to find playmates for<br/>
Jayn from amongst gently parented kids. The distant second is to find, if<br/>
not lifelong deep friendships for myself, then at least congenial<br/>
acquaintances. The languishing third is to have easier access to some places<br/>
that have group discounts and are more fun to attend in a group. I get my<br/>
emotional and intellectual support (despite this not being the intended<br/>
purpose) from this list, and its sisters UnschoolingBasics, and<br/>
AlwaysLearning. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tolerance doesn&#39;t mean you have to live with the people or even rub elbows<br/>
with them! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Tolerance means you trust that people who are making informed choices are<br/>
making the right choice for them. You might not choose to be Buddhist for<br/>
yourself but accept that those who do choose Buddhism are doing so because<br/>
it suits their needs.<br/>
<br/>
People who choose school are doing what they think is best for their kids. I<br/>
even spend time with some! ;-) But that doesn&#39;t mean I want to sit around<br/>
for an afternoon of school talk.<br/>
<br/>
And being tolerant doesn&#39;t mean you believe all behavior is equal. One of my<br/>
lines is behavior that&#39;s deliberately hurtful. Tolerance means you don&#39;t<br/>
believe that everyone needs to be like you and think like you to be a good<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, you don&#39;t have to spend time with them to be tolerant! Spend<br/>
your time with those you enjoy being with.<br/>

One of my favorite phrases! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Start a yahoo e-group----like maybe <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_EasternVAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com">_EasternVAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:EasternVAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com">EasternVAUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a>) .  Post an invitation to all the <br/>
groups in your area. <br/>
 <br/>
Start a play group/ park day that meets EVERY Tuesday (or whenever) at a  <br/>
certain park. BE THERE every week----even if you&#39;re just by yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
Post flyers at the health food stores and libraries.<br/>
 <br/>
Contact LLL leaders and ask them to broadcast your new group----many have  <br/>
older children as well.<br/>
 <br/>
There are others out there in your same position. They may be members of  <br/>
some local group----just because it&#39;s local and they think there are no other  <br/>
options. MAKE the option! <br/>
 <br/>
Build it, and they WILL come! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I love this!  I just finished reading _My Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn, which<br/>
was fabulous, BTW.  In the book Ishmael states that tribal societies worked<br/>
as well as they did, for as long as they did, because they did what worked<br/>
for Their Tribe.  He states many times that there is no One Right Way to<br/>
live.  It gave me a whole new outlook on tolerance.  He also has a chapter<br/>
called Unschooling the World (I think that was the name, but I left the book<br/>
in Florida for my sister to read next!) where he talks about the uselessness<br/>
of education as it is currently defined and implemented. <br/>

&gt; Any insight?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start your own group - make the description of it as an <br/>
&quot;unschooling-friendly&quot; group clear from the beginning - have it in <br/>
writing on the email list description or website.  I even make handouts <br/>
that I take and pass around at the park every once in a while - as a <br/>
reminder.<br/>
<br/>
Our group is not composed of all unschoolers. The group is very very <br/>
purposeful in its intention to be a group that is comfortable for <br/>
unschoolers and the group ITSELF is unschoolish - in that we make it <br/>
very clear that park day is PLAY day and what they do with their time <br/>
is up to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
During September there is often too much talk about curriculum and <br/>
charter schools and so on -- if it gets too boring or annoying I <br/>
usually say something cheerful like, &quot;Okay - enough of this - the <br/>
unschoolers among us are being turned into zombies!&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are enough of us who are unschoolers that we can get up and walk <br/>
away and hang out together, too. Also - it passes. And, we don&#39;t have <br/>
to listen to much complaining about curriculum or programs that aren&#39;t <br/>
working (that is the part that bothers me most) because &quot;You don&#39;t have <br/>
to do it,&quot; is the smiling and cheerful response that they hear over and <br/>
over when they complain and there isn&#39;t much they can say after that. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This year, so far, it isn&#39;t happening. What HAS happened is that we had <br/>
a big influx of people with really young children, lots of toddlers and <br/>
babies - so we started sounding like a la leche meeting. Those of us <br/>
with teenagers are feeling a bit -- aged. Also, there is only so much <br/>
talking about the details of breastfeeding that I&#39;m still interested in <br/>
&lt;G&gt;. But it is REALLY nice to have them all there - the babies, <br/>
toddlers, and older kids, too. I&#39;m not really complaining!!  It makes <br/>
me so happy to think that by the time these little ones are school age, <br/>
their moms and dads will have had the benefit of hanging around all the <br/>
older unschooling kids and parents and, whether they completely <br/>
unschool or not, they are likely to be far more relaxed than they would <br/>
have otherwise.<br/>

How do  you all, being such a strongly opinionated<br/>
group, have the tolerance to  participate in such<br/>
inclusive groups?  Our local homeschool  association is<br/>
&#39;inclusive&#39; but I don&#39;t think they claim to  be<br/>
&#39;secular&#39;.  And, it&#39;s not completely  &#39;play-focused&#39;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I helped start an inclusive, non-religious group.  I always  thought people <br/>
who really couldn&#39;t tolerate differences of religion, etc.  (religion is the <br/>
biggie here, as it is in lots of places) would self-select out  of it.  That&#39;s <br/>
pretty much what happened.  Lots of people in that  group, now.  I know some of <br/>
them are of the religious bent that doesn&#39;t  approve of certain other kinds <br/>
of lifestyles, but they pretty much  have shut up about it.  What other <br/>
position is there to take, really?  <br/>
 <br/>
A group that doesn&#39;t claim to be secular probably isn&#39;t, and has a  <br/>
particular religious flavor, and you should watch out for that if it bothers  you.  <br/>
Inclusive in those circles usually means they don&#39;t mind if you don&#39;t  use <br/>
curriculum.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another person and I are starting an EXclusive group really soon (in a  <br/>
different area than the last one).  For UNSCHOOLERS and those who want to  be, <br/>
only.  Actually, I don&#39;t really care who comes, as long as they don&#39;t  get all <br/>
schooly on us.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280123217">DO IT!  DO IT!  That what I did and boy did the unschoolers and wanna-be&#39;s come out in droves!  Almost 60 unschooling families just north of Austin, and 35 in South/Central Austin.  I think exclusive unschooling groups are of the utmost importance.  However, when unschoolers have only knows religious based-gotta-sign-a-statement-of-faith groups, they often just want a group of homeschoolers where everyone is welcome.  I think nothing is as uplifting to an unschooling family as a whole as spending time with other unschooling families.  In inclusive groups, discussion always quickly slides to curriculum use and schedules.  Bleck!  People found that our desire to have an exclusive group was harsh and mean at first, but they don&#39;t think so anymore.  I am on a few inclusive lists, though, and each time unschooling gets mentioned, everyone batters the unschooler.  There&#39;s a huge need for unschooling-only lists and groups.<br/>

those unschoolers in the Eugene, Oregon area.  8 people have signed <br/>
up so far! *grin*  I haven&#39;t really gone to too many lengths <br/>
to &quot;advertise&quot; it yet.  And, although I did not use the <br/>
word &#39;exclusive&#39; in the description, that&#39;s exactly what it is!  I <br/>
specifically stated that it was not a homeschooling list or Waldorf <br/>
unschooling list or a list for someone who is unsure what unschooling <br/>
is.  Hmm...perhaps I should revise that an add &#39;exclusive&#39; <br/>

weed out the unschoolers, having an exclusive group would be ideal <br/>
for me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This would be me with children ages 1 and 3!<br/>
It&#39;s just that all you &#39;experienced&#39; unschoolers are so cool to hang <br/>
out with!  Can&#39;t find better conversation!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582087306">-=-If the focus is religious education or discussion, then that is a <br/>
decision<br/>
the parents must debate themselves. Be aware that many of the <br/>
religious<br/>
groups state openly that they are there to support the correct use <br/>
of<br/>
religiously based academic curricula, especially in the <br/>
sciences.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Today I was at the Field Museum with another mom and her two <br/>
unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to do a &quot;highlights of the museum&quot; tour (from which <br/>
we bailed partway through).<br/>
<br/>
Early in, though, the docent asked where we were from.  I was <br/>
the only non-Chicago resident.   She asked about the kids: <br/>
&quot;homeschooled.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Oh!  We get a LOT of homeschoolers here! [pause] <br/>
And they&#39;re *all* *smart.*&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she looked away, Kim and I shrugged and made the <br/>
big-eyes at each other.  <br/>
<br/>
Moments later she was talking about how many millions of years <br/>
old this Tyranosaurus Rex was.  Not long after that, the evolution <br/>
of whales.<br/>
<br/>
YEAH, right!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The smart homeschoolers are the only ones who will visit a <br/>
blatantly &quot;false-science&quot; and non-creationist, unGodly place as <br/>
the temptation-of-Satan &quot;Field Museum.&quot;   The Creationist, <br/>
have-faith, don&#39;t-question, stay-home-where-it&#39;s-safe <br/>
homeschoolers probably tend not to go there.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make me intolerant?<br/>
Does it make The Field Museum intolerant?<br/>
Some things I&#39;m not interested in tolerating, and the idea of <br/>
keeping kids away from school so that they won&#39;t hear people <br/>
suggesting chimpanzees are our nearest relative (the THIRD <br/>
blasphemous phrase the woman used) is not a tolerable thing <br/>
in my own personal universe.<br/>
<br/>
But luckily for my univese, the people who teach their children <br/>
revisionist history and creationist science are  homeschooling <br/>
chiefly to keep their children away from people like me.<br/>
<br/>
The hard question then is whether they and we (unschoolers, <br/>
rational, scientific, skeptical, humanist, whatever)  and they are <br/>
&quot;doing the same thing.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing we&#39;re doing that&#39;s the same is not sending our <br/>
children to school.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that&#39;s enough similarity for some people.<br/>
Politically it&#39;s the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically and educationally, there are profound <br/>
differences.<br/>
<br/>
I have believed that for thirteen years, and my willingness to state <br/>
it seems to have gotten me in trouble.   <br/>
<br/>
Being a person who knows how to get A&#39;s in school, knows how <br/>
to &quot;give the teacher what he wants,&quot; knows how to suck up to <br/>
authority figures, I *could* say the politically correct thing, the <br/>
&quot;tolerant&quot; thing, the &quot;supportive&quot; thing, but I&#39;m not in school <br/>
anymore.  I won&#39;t trade my integrity for an A.<br/>

This reminds me of the woman who called two days ago looking for <br/>
homeschool help. After answering a few questions, I started asking <br/>
HER questions. And...yep, here came the infamous chimp comment. It <br/>
always amazes me that these very uninformed people think we come from <br/>
chimps....I sent her to the local religious group with a flea in her <br/>
ear. I told her that she&#39;d better allow her 11 year old daughter some <br/>
freedom to form her own thoughts as she grew or there WOULD be helll <br/>
in that household. Sara in NC</div>

I&#39;m not the author of the quoted quote, but I will answer for my own life and <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids ask questions about things that neither of us can prove, I say <br/>
&quot;some people believe X because of whatever, and others belive Y because of <br/>
whatever else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think varying explanations of life should be offered to <br/>
children, in such cases as explanations vary.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I think there is a differance between &#39;uninformed&#39; people <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Right. <br/>
But no one except the clueless claim that people evolved from chimpanzees.  <br/>
It&#39;s said to seem ridiculous, so that the hearer will be embarrassed.    The <br/>
idea that humans and other apes perhaps evolved from common ancestors is not as <br/>
goofy/stunning/wrong.  <br/>

Hi Jennefer, I agree there is a difference between uninformed and <br/>
misinformed...this woman is deliberately uninformed. Many people in <br/>
my area refuse to consider, much less actually hear...discussion on <br/>
evolution. They are the kind that clap their children&#39;s ears when <br/>
such talk comes up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

When I started answering my children&#39;s questions about this I did <br/>
give them versions and we read about the different beliefs...so that <br/>
is a yes. Sorry to be unclear. Sara in NC</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565829778">when my dd was five she asked me who made the world and the people. i told <br/>
her that some people believe this and others believe that but since i wasn&#39;t <br/>
there i didn&#39;t really know for sure. she put her hands on her hips and said, <br/>
if you don&#39;t know then just take me to the library so i can find out. lol. <br/>
we went to the library and she checked out many books on the subject and we <br/>
read them together. when she was done (a couple of weeks later) she said <br/>
well i believe this. her thoughts have evolved and changed over the years <br/>
but it isn&#39;t something that is that important to her now. it was however a <br/>
great learning experience for her. it taught her that things aren&#39;t always <br/>
black and white (and also that her mom didn&#39;t know all the answers).<br/>
