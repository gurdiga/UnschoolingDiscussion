  **Hey, I&#39;ve been to that aquarium!  Nobody was sleeping on the floor when I was <br/>
  there.<br/>
  It&#39;s a very cool place.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Abbi, dd8,  and her girl scout troop went to &#39;Sleeping with the Sharks&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  Its an overnight,  where you get to tour the facility,  talk with the workers,  have a pizza party and then you sleep in the tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
  It was very cool,  I&#39;d look up and shark would be floating on over.     In the night you have a bit of light still on from above the water so you can see the fish as you are laying there.   In the morning when I woke up a huge sea turtle was swimming over me!   <br/>
<br/>
  The girls were very impressed, as were most moms,  a few moms were feeling a bit clastrophobic,  thinking,,&quot;hmm,  what would happen if that glass fell in,,,&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I had a bit of a hard time sleeping on a hard surface with my achy fibro body,  but I made it through.    Abbi would not have gone if I wouldn&#39;t have gone with.   Its 4 hours away from us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It was a good time.    If anyone is every in Bloomington MN,  you should check it out.    here&#39;s their site:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.underwaterworld.com/">http://www.underwaterworld.com/</a><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  PS. The whole experience really had a whole new twist too because we had just gone to Finding Nemo, so I kept talking like the turtle in that movie,  &quot;Aaahh, Dude!&quot;   Could not stop myself!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Yeah,  sometimes these similaries are quite startling!<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t hurt that bad though,  I&#39;ve heard some people that are soooo debilitated.  My heart goes out for them.   If I keep myself healthy, be very mindful about my living,  then I&#39;m pretty good.  ;-)<br/>

It would leak fish-pee on you first.  You could get out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t guess they would make an aquarium like that in southern California.<br/>
I thought of Southern California the other day at Lowe&#39;s giant hardware <br/>
warehouse when I looked up, WAY up, at stacks of five gallon paint cans WAY on top <br/>
of the already WAY high shelves, and I said &quot;I bet they wouldn&#39;t to that in <br/>
Los Angeles.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Five gallons of paint could do you some damage if it feel from your own <br/>
height.<br/>

They do it in northern California, and we get earthquakes, too.<br/>
<br/>
I walk around places like Home Depot glancing upwards nervously and<br/>
fretting about the possibility of tremors.  It seems insane to me.<br/>
<br/>
At my old office we weren&#39;t allowed to keep anything heavier than a book<br/>
on shelves that were 5 or 6 feet off the ground, for fear that it would<br/>
clonk us in an earthquake as we sat at our desks.  (They didn&#39;t put much<br/>
stock in the idea that we could dive under our desks for protection.)<br/>

a sucky disorder in common, yet we all live this same type of lifestyle. <br/>
Sorrily, I won&#39;t be able to make the conference this year, but gentle hugs to you <br/>
both and perhaps someday we will all meet. I am just sitting here in shock, <br/>
that I hadn&#39;t noticed before. So now I can tell Kass and Kree they have the same <br/>
thing besides unschooling in common with Dagny and Abbi, too. You&#39;re right, <br/>
it does suck for them too, but do you ever wonder if the illness itself has <br/>
cleared your vision of what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not?  Just wondering.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039960729">Hi Rhonda - I absolutely think fms has given me a chance to understand<br/>
what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not.  It&#39;s given me (and my whole family) a new<br/>
perspective on the ups and downs of life, and on how we want to live our<br/>
lives.  On most days (those when I&#39;m not completely sleep deprived :0)) I<br/>
actually think of it as a gift of sorts.  It&#39;s taught me a lot, and given me<br/>
patience I&#39;m not sure I would have developed otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
How do you feel that it affects your kids?  Mine do sometimes get frustrated<br/>
with my limitations, but overall I think it&#39;s made them very compassionate<br/>
and thoughtful.  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow Rue, that is a loaded question, but I guess I started it, huh? It&#39;s <br/>
definately difficult on days that I can&#39;t walk or worse when I can&#39;t see and my <br/>
equilibrium is off.  But overall I often tell people that I see it as a blessing <br/>
in disguise. Not that I wouldn&#39;t trade my body in for a better model if given <br/>
the chance, but since that isn&#39;t gonna happen, we just deal day to day. I <br/>
retired 5 years ago, following my back surgery and during such a trying time, it <br/>
gave me an opportunity to look at my life in more of a big picture. DH and I <br/>
had already worked odd schedules so that the twins would never be in someone <br/>
elses care. In 1996 I went thru 3 major operations in a row and a near death <br/>
experience. Talk about having to reflect. I went from an extremely <br/>
type-A/workaholic life, you know the type---&quot;If I make a ton of money I can <br/>
buy their happiness.&quot; to OMG, it could all be over in a split second, so I need <br/>
to make each moment count. I went back to work, but very part time so that <br/>
while the girls were in school, I could make a buck and be home when they were <br/>
home. Somethow though that still wasn&#39;t working. I was a litteral walking (half <br/>
slumped over like an 80 year old) zombie and was of no good to them, at least <br/>
the way I knew I was supposed to be. Then came the back surgery and that made <br/>
me reflect even more. I was told that more children were not an option and <br/>
that without the surgery, my legs would be done working within 6 months. So I <br/>
went for the surgery and what do you know, I found homeschooling that wasn&#39;t <br/>
based on the religious right, which I had been under the perception was the only <br/>
way it existed. As I continued to research, I found Unschooling.com and found <br/>
out everything I was craving was in fact valid and could be done if one was <br/>
willing to change their POV from that which we are taught as the norm. <br/>
<br/>
Wow, I started typing and ended up with a small novel. I never even answered <br/>
your question. Sorry. I guess I would say that Kass & Kree are very aware and <br/>
sensitive to my plight. There are times like most recently when they have <br/>
small break downs. I think this is due to the combination of their raging 11 year <br/>
old hormones and seeing me go thru a really trying time. I&#39;d also say they are <br/>
very considerate and compassionate. There are things that DH and I have <br/>
chosen not to discuss with them until it&#39;s absolutely necessary. There is no need <br/>
for their little hearts and minds to worry, especially with things that aren&#39;t <br/>
fixable or currently have no answers for. Did that even make sense? Perhaps <br/>
I&#39;m just babbling now. But I will say that when I recently posted about Kass <br/>
being hateful last Sunday, when she came back in to apologize, she specified that <br/>
sometimes she just gets so angry because it&#39;s not fair that I can&#39;t do a lot <br/>
of stuff that I used to and she wishes it would go away. That was definately a <br/>
catch 22 moment. I understand her frustration, since I myself feel <br/>
frustrated, but by the same token, I am grateful for all that it has brought to our <br/>
lives. Ultimately, I think they will be better human beings for it and that is all <br/>
I really want for them. It also gives us reason to discuss things such as the <br/>
afterlife and what I think about love, life and the universe. These are not <br/>
things they&#39;d get from school and I wonder how much time we would spend <br/>
discussing such things if our lives hadn&#39;t been turned upside down by it all.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I wore out anyones eyes, I didn&#39;t know I would share so much myself.<br/>
