systems.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, been on the phone for 2 hours last<br/>
evening and this morning, they want to charge me a small fortune to have<br/>
someone come over and check it (no where for me to take it in around<br/>
here).   And the soonest they can get here is Saturday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t care - I&#39;m dying.  I&#39;m going to miss all my shows on BBC<br/>
America!<br/>
