Government schooling was established in this country with the over-riding<br/>
purpose of creating a reliable &quot;work force&quot; for the industrial revolution<br/>
and also to turn out soldiers who would be obedient (follow orders). It<br/>
never had anything to do with culture or enlightenment or other benefits to<br/>
the citizens. It was to benefit business and government, hand in hand. As<br/>
others, such as John Taylor Gatto, have written about, the US government<br/>
school system was fashioned after the one in Prussia, now Germany, that<br/>
gave us Fascism and a totally obedient citizenry horribly misled by Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of our government school system, like Prussia&#39;s, has never been<br/>
the education of the citizens, it is a system that not only prevents what<br/>
most on this list would call education, but it even prevents the desire for<br/>
learning in many people. As Gatto has pointed out and documented, the design<br/>
of the system is to prevent inquiry, to quash dissent, to teach the absolute<br/>
worship of authority. Thus, the school employees have taken on the roles of<br/>
a weird kind of clergy, talking down to the masses of parents who seek even<br/>
a little control over the lives and learning of the children they send to<br/>
those institutions.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we have allowed it to happen, but government has used all its tricks to<br/>
make us think that we have wanted it, and is still doing that. In this<br/>
sense, the saying we hear...&quot;We ARE the government&quot; is simply not<br/>
true...government employees and &quot;leaders&quot; have huge resources that no group<br/>
of citizens can command, and they use them to keep the population as<br/>
ignorant as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Taking our children out of that system and being responsible for them in<br/>
every way is the only road back from the sellout that has happened. Whatever<br/>
its cost, we owe it to our kids to keep them safe from the damage that the<br/>
government does to them with its schools.<br/>

school. It sounds like a good idea for many reasons so there can&#39;t have been<br/>
one single idea behind its implementation.<br/>
<br/>
If people chose a model designed (as Gatto says) to control the masses that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean those choosing it didn&#39;t think they could find a good use for<br/>
an efficient factory model that could crank out a less ignorant population<br/>
for a lot less money than private tutors for everyone.<br/>

concerned.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t imply that I think every thing is hunky-dory as far as freedom<br/>
to homeschool is concerned. But this supposedly tricky government with it&#39;s<br/>
incredible resources keeping us ignorant has suddenly become incredibly<br/>
inefficient and ineffectual for the past 10 or 20 years as far as<br/>
controlling homeschoolers is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
This conspiracy stuff just isn&#39;t hanging together.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to conjure up a scary controlling government to recognize that<br/>
*people* get nervous about things they have no control over. In fact the<br/>
Scary Government blinds us to our own part in the whole mess and blames it<br/>
on some faceless uncontrollable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a human being, I don&#39;t want to make my life more uncomfortable to<br/>
accomodate something I don&#39;t like and don&#39;t have the ability to control. If<br/>
&quot;the government&quot; gets its fingers into homeschooling, it won&#39;t be because<br/>
Big Brother can&#39;t control us but because our neighbors are nervous about<br/>
supporting our potentially ignorant children who will undoubtedly end up on<br/>
welfare. We have met the enemy and he is us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think most of us understand what you are saying. The problem is (the way I <br/>
see it anyway) that you are essentially preaching to the choir. Most on this <br/>
list have already taken our children out, or have never had our children in <br/>
the public school system. The other problem is there are good people in the <br/>
system, it isn&#39;t this black hole sucking the life blood out of our country. <br/>
While there are so many things wrong with the system that educates, there are <br/>
just as many things that are good about it. For many, school is the only <br/>
option. There are a multitude of parents out there volunteering, giving time <br/>
and talent to the schools their children attend. All of us have chosen to <br/>
devote that energy toward a singular purpose, our children. There are some on <br/>
this list who have children in the school system and this constant berating <br/>
can&#39;t make them feel good about the choices they either make willingly or are <br/>
forced to make because of circumstances. School reform isn&#39;t going to happen <br/>
on an unschooling list, and while I tend to admire (and agree with you on <br/>
some of the finer points) the attempt is just a tad overwhelming. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s good never to automatically think.<br/>
<br/>
There IS not other side to &quot;ALL American schools...&quot; or &quot;THE history of the <br/>
American School system...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no other side to &quot;All dogs have four legs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that statement is famously untrue.<br/>
Some dogs have three legs.<br/>
<br/>
Not many.<br/>
<br/>
So the Western U.S. school models are not the three-legged dogs of American <br/>
education.  It&#39;s probable that the industrial-revolution model is a smaller <br/>
percentage of the history than was presented as &quot;simple&quot; truth here.<br/>
<br/>
If there were schools in the U.S. before the industrial revolution, then that <br/>
was not the basis for schools.<br/>
<br/>
(Hint:  There were schools in the U.S. before the industrial revolution, and <br/>
there were entire states--lots of them--never in industrial zones.)<br/>
<br/>
When European immigration was high, schools were probably HUGELY desired by <br/>
immigrant parents as a way for those kids to learn English.  Was it an evil <br/>
plot of the government to provide instruction to people from two dozen or way <br/>
more different linguistic backgrounds?<br/>
