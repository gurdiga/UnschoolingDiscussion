<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201657494">I&#39;ve been asked a few times why the kids aren&#39;t in school, they&#39;ve been<br/>
asked a few times also.  We say we homeschool and most people drop the<br/>
subject.  Robin does however like to go into details about how great it<br/>
is and they should do it too.  People smile at him and are polite (well<br/>
he looks like the Little Prince - I&#39;m sure that doesn&#39;t hurt).<br/>
<br/>
A few times people have told us about their experiences with<br/>
homeschooling or homeschoolers (so far it&#39;s always been positive).<br/>
<br/>
Last fall while the kids and I were goofing off at a pumpkin patch, a<br/>
private school pulled up and one of the moms asked me if we were with<br/>
their school.  I said no we homeschool.  She said their school was so<br/>
progressive that it was the same thing.  I just looked at her and said,<br/>
no it&#39;s not.  That was the end of that.<br/>
