<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776193367">HI everyone, <br/>
Yes it&#39;s me AGAIN, with problems at home.  This time it is Alex, my <br/>
three year old.  He has a cut on his little pinky finger that is not <br/>
healing well at all.  It has gotten angry red around the cut, and the <br/>
cut itself is not very pretty.  We have been keeping it clean and <br/>
treating it with Neosporin and clean bandages.  Can anyone suggest <br/>
some measures we can take to head off an infection and keep the <br/>
little guy from having to down any nasty antibiotics from the doctor?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980483204">Nanci, Here are some quick thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Hydrogen peroxide<br/>
2. Tea tree oil products (ointment/first aid cream)<br/>
3.  Calendula cream/ointment - a derivative of marigold and sold at most health food stores.<br/>
4.  Colloidal silver products.  These can be bought in several forms including ointment.  This is a natural antibiotic and can be bought in a form suitable for oral consumption and safe for children.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your son heals soon!  Annette<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706186728">Nanci, I&#39;ve had luck with my little ones (who won&#39;t leave owies alone) by<br/>
putting on new neosporin and a clean bandage right after they fall asleep.<br/>
Then it&#39;s sure to work at least for those 8-10 hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920011786">its already infected by the sound of it. Get some aloe vera on it and that will kill it as well...I can&#39;t remember the other remedy right off hand but there should be another one....Sounds like you are doing the best you can right now as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960153358">A good topical antibiotic like Neosporin usually works wonders on us. I know it isn&#39;t herbal, but it also doesn&#39;t require a prescription.<br/>
