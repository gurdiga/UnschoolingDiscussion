<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390486304">I probably missed all the original &#39;on list&#39; praise and discussion, but I just had to say...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Loved it!        Wonderful!       A &quot;respectful parenting&quot; & &quot;unschooling&quot; & &quot;joyful living&quot; must read!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want a &quot;FREE THE CHILDREN!&quot; bumper sticker and a T-shirt and a hat...    <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Rue!<br/>
And thanks to all those who inspired her and supported her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005783289">I just thought I would repeat all this, something Kelly sent a week and some <br/>
back, mostly because I wanted people to have the address again.    I still <br/>
haven&#39;t received my &quot;real&quot; books, but I got to read it pre-publication, and all <br/>
the good things people say are absolutely true.   I love the tone, and I love <br/>
the format, and it&#39;s all the information people had to read for years to <br/>
gather, years ago, and from now on can get from that book.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Rue Kream is ready to take orders for her new book. She&#39;s not<br/>
comfortable blowing her own horn, but *I* am delighted to! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Entitled _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life_, it is in a Q&A<br/>
format where Rue answers most, if not all &lt;g&gt;, of the questions we all<br/>
have heard or will hear as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sweet, gentle book---just like Rue! And self-published!<br/>
<br/>
I hope she will be flooded with your orders!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s her new website to promote the book---go judge this book by its<br/>
lovely cover! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Rue&#39;s cute little butt! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, tickled to death to announce this!<br/>

**That&#39;s  a nice thing to sound like!  My father-in-law&#39;s not so lucky -  his<br/>
name is Dick Kream &lt;G&gt;.  ~Rue<br/>

That may be the saddest (and funniest) thing I ever heard.  His  parents must <br/>
have had a truly sick sense of humor.<br/>
