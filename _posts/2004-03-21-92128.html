Not everything that looks fun is worth doing.  Do you really want to <br/>
promote the wastefulness of a food fight?  Many people have <br/>
difficulties being able to afford to buy food to eat, let alone to <br/>
use it as a toy.  This might be a perfect opportunity to discuss <br/>
wastefulness, and perhaps even to encourage a charitable donation to <br/>
a hunger center with the very foods that may have been used in the <br/>
food fight.  I may be a bit biased about this because of my <br/>
upbringing, but my parents lived throught the Second World War in <br/>
Europe and suffered from hunger, so from early on it was instilled in <br/>
me that we do not waste.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888551562">Some thoughts on food fights:<br/>
<br/>
Maybe make it easy stuff like a box of chex mix or something.  I doesn&#39;t have to cost a lot, it doesn&#39;t stick to anything, and the birds can eat it.<br/>
<br/>
I agree it would be best to do something like that outside!!! Have fun!<br/>

=================================<br/>
I can understand and appreciate the idealism in this response, but sometimes<br/>
fun needs to be fun. Pointing out the wastefulness of a food fight just<br/>
kinda sucks the life out being a kid, you know? But maybe talking about that<br/>
and providing some kind of balance like donating food to a local shelter<br/>
would be a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking....<br/>
<br/>
Have a food fight party this summer and ask each guest to bring a donation<br/>
of non-perishable foods for the local soup kitchen. That could be both fun<br/>
and socially aware--a chance to bring volunteerism and charity into your<br/>
lives in a meaningful way. Could be loads of fun and a useful life lesson.<br/>

<br/>
I think food fights only work when they&#39;re spontaneous, and at the table.  <br/>
And they&#39;re never a really good thing.  I&#39;ve been involved in some light ones, <br/>
at medieval feasts.  Not nice.  <br/>
<br/>
Taking it out and using food as the materials in the  yard, as though it were <br/>
a planned snowball fight with a starting time wouldn&#39;t be classic &quot;food <br/>
fight&quot; but instant mashed potatoes and raw eggs are both pretty cheap.  Oatmeal.  <br/>
Jello.  Maybe you could make some things like that and have a minor <br/>
demonstration foodfight.   <br/>
<br/>
The classic item is peas, launched with a fork.  Those are cheap too.  <br/>
<br/>
If you live near an egg farm you can get B-grade eggs very inexpensively if <br/>
they want to throw eggs.  Tell them NOT to throw eggs ever ever at cars <br/>
(because of damage to the paint job) or windows (because they can break) or anything <br/>
that needs to smell good later.  Back cinder-block walls, dirt roads, <br/>
driveways...   my kids have thrown eggs in those places when they wanted to see what <br/>
it was like to break an egg with force.<br/>
<br/>
But it would hurt to throw eggs at people, so that&#39;s better for target stuff <br/>
or just the heck of it.   <br/>
<br/>
Lima beans.  Few humans actually eat lima beans.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as the food is going into the yard, it isn&#39;t wasteful.  The biomass<br/>
helps retain water for the plants....the insects get a meal....it may just<br/>
decompose and feed the plants.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hang-up about wasting stuff too.  So I work to look at things<br/>
differently to see if things are REALLY being wasted from a global<br/>
perspective.<br/>

Not quite sure as I&#39;m no lima bean expert, but I think you meant to say<br/>
Fordhook. I love lima beans and are especially partial to the baby limas.<br/>
They are my favorite veggie. Joe loves them too and so does Alyssa (3) She<br/>
gobbles up almost as much as I can. In fact we just had them twice last<br/>
week. Alyssa loves them more than broccoli!!<br/>

   I&#39;m no expert either, all I know is, is that I find those BIG white beans <br/>
(butter beans maybe?) rather ikky.  And broccoli is a food group all on it&#39;s <br/>

I am just curious about food fights.  My ds Andrew, 6 has requested such an <br/>
activity after watching a couple in movies and I&#39;m all for it but has anyone <br/>
ever done it?  I am thinking outdoors and garden hose.  He likes to help cook <br/>
and we talked about making things for this &quot;adventure&quot;.  Like mashed <br/>
potatoes, <br/>
jello, and other relatively soft things so they don&#39;t hurt on impact after <br/>
being launched at someone.  I asked why he&#39;d like to do it.  He said it looks <br/>
fun. <br/>
So my questions are:  Will the fun be lost in the planning of this activity <br/>
or should we just do it one day without his knowledge to retain the element <br/>
of <br/>
surprise?  What other food ideas?  Has anyone done this, am I crazy?  Any <br/>
ideas?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
WE had a &quot;Dress for Mess&quot; party for Cameron when he was eight. ALL the kids <br/>
showed up in their bathing suits. He had a big table set up outside with all <br/>
sorts of messy things to do. For each child, we had:<br/>
 <br/>
watermelons with seed-spitting afterwards<br/>
&quot;mud-pies&quot; (chocolate pudding in cheap graham cracker shells with whipped <br/>
cream on top)   or tossing<br/>
canisters of whipped cream<br/>
canned cherries <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t remember what else, maybe:  <br/>
shaving cream canisters <br/>
silly string<br/>
 <br/>
Mashed potatoes might be fun.<br/>
 <br/>
When they were done, we hosed them off and let them swim. <br/>
 <br/>
It was a really fun party. The pictures are hysterical!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883673295">---most definitely need canned early peas - they fly well when flung <br/>
from the fork or spoon and then stick where they hit and kind of <br/>
mush. We used to do that when mom & dad would go out to get burgers <br/>
off the grill, leaving the 3 of us in the kitchen with a plate of <br/>
peas and mashed potatoes. They&#39;d come back in, the peas would be <br/>
about half gone and there&#39;d be green freckles on the walls, ceiling, <br/>
kids,...<br/>
<br/>
Might also add food coloring to the mashed taters (use the instant <br/>
kind in big quantities and powdered milk and water to mix them with) <br/>
for a &quot;Hook&quot; style food fight (that&#39;s our favorite scene in that <br/>
movie - where Robin Williams rediscovers his imagination and they <br/>
have a technicolor food fight).<br/>
<br/>
One time, we were over at the IL&#39;s back before DH and I got married <br/>
and we were having a lovely dinner - then SIL#1 put a wedge of <br/>
tomato on her fork and mimed flinging it at MIL. DH happened to be <br/>
passing behind SIL at the time and he &quot;triggered&quot; the release so the <br/>
tomato flew across the table and hit MIL in the forehead. We all <br/>
just broke up laughing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945095712">If you have a day-old breadstore, get several big loaves of French bread for <br/>
them to break chunks off and throw, or to make breadballs (little balls of <br/>
wadded up bread).   <br/>
<br/>
Watermelon cut into little cubes?<br/>
<br/>
Green beans and corn (not corn on the cob, but kernels off) would make it <br/>
colorful.<br/>
<br/>
After (I&#39;m assuming this is outside picnic style somewhere) you could gather <br/>
up ground-food to feed to birds at your house later (unless it is at your <br/>
house) or rats (if you have pet rats) or to put in the compost.   Thinking of my <br/>
own house, I think I&#39;d wait until the stuff dried up some and put most of it in <br/>
the compost pile.   If you picnic near a river, you could throw the food in <br/>
the water for fish and whoever all in there to have.  Or throw it to ducks!    <br/>
<br/>
A foodfight where ducks are, though, might turn into the ducks taking over.<br/>
