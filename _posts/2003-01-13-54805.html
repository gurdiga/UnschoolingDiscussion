<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My child and my unborn child are different in an emotional, and I feel legal<br/>
&gt; sense.  I guess I see it this way; were I drowning, and my child drowning,<br/>
&gt; and a choice must be made,  please save my child. Even if I&#39;m pregnant. Even<br/>
&gt; if the baby is about to be born.  The child I have held, nursed, and loved<br/>
&gt; is the one whose rights take precedence.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is very nicely said, Rachel Ann.  I appreciate your insights into<br/>
Jewish law and practice, as well.  We hear the Christian perspective so<br/>
often.<br/>
