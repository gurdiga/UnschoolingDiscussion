&gt;&gt; Does anyone <br/>
&gt;&gt; have<br/>
&gt;&gt; ideas on easy readers that are a little more interesting for tweens?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  There are two great ones Get the Asterix series and/or the Tin Tin<br/>
series of comix style books. Go to www.CommonReader.com<br/>
They are so good, they&#39;ve been translated into dozens of languages and sold,<br/>
of course, around the world. The absolute best. Kids can&#39;t put them down.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely good! But definitely not easy readers though! In the case of Tin<br/>
Tin, the type is dense and the vocabulary is definitely above elementary.<br/>
And you&#39;ll probably want to be there to provide some historical commentary<br/>
on the black faces with big red lips and opium dens. And as I recall Asterix<br/>
has a lot of sophisticated (but low brow ;-) jokes that it would be a shame<br/>
she&#39;d miss without someone there to explain them!<br/>
