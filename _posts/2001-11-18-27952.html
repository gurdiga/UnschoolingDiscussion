<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am 28, have lived away from home since 18, and still struggle with <br/>
&gt; drinking <br/>
&gt; soda pop. For a long time I thought it was an addiction. I go long periods <br/>
&gt; without it, but then start drinking it again, day and night. Yes caffeine <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; addictive, but I never drink coffee or tea, and never just horde chocolate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soda pop was &#39;for grown ups&#39; when I was a kid. It was rationed out, we had <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; ask for it and were often refused, we had to prepare it for our parents.  <br/>
&gt; Or <br/>
&gt; we&#39;d get it as a treat if we were ill (go figure) or had gotten hurt. My <br/>
&gt; sister also clings near to her pepsi at all times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Immature yes, but I still feel like I&#39;m exercising my freedom and autonomy <br/>
&gt; when I buy and drink pop.<br/>

broccoli...it&#39;s good for me, etc. etc.   Then Dubya&#39;s daddy did the one thing <br/>
I aever really liked--he mentioned he didn&#39;t like broccoli, and didn&#39;t eat <br/>
it. Of course this led to great controversy (which tells you how silly the <br/>
world can be.)  I felt strongly that if the president didn&#39;t want to eat <br/>
broccoli, he shouldn&#39;t have to. And I don&#39;t either.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t push eating things on Julian just because they&#39;re good for him.  <br/>
Sometimes he complains he doesn&#39;t like broccoli, but then he&#39;ll order <br/>
broccoli-cheese soup at a reataurant we like.  But then...he&#39;s a bit weird. I <br/>
think it&#39;s all that television he watches.<br/>
