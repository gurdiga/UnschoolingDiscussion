hi,
<p>here&#39;s some info from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.snopes.com/info/current.htm">http://www.snopes.com/info/current.htm</a>
<p>Gas Out
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participating
in a &quot;gas out&quot; will help bring the retail price of gasoline down.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;
False.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
didn&#39;t work last year, and it won&#39;t work this year. See our Pain in the
Gas page.
<p>here&#39;s an excerpt from their &#39;Pain in the Gas page&#39;:
<p>Origins:&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s time for the second annual &quot;gas out,&quot; the
same non-event that was staged last year, though this time
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stretched out to cover a three-day
period instead of just the one day (April 30) in 1999.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even those who are usually level-headed
and have little problem waving off the emotions of the moment to see through
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the logical inconsistencies of
whatever the latest bit of rabble-rousing is pushing are having a hard
time with this one. Gas
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prices are much higher than we&#39;re
used to seeing them, and perhaps this triggers horrible memories left over
from the oil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embargo of the 1970s. Whatever
the reason, those whose blood is boiling over current gas prices are determined
to see as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a legitimate boycott what&#39;s nothing
more than a misdirected expression of anger.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By definition, a boycott involves
the doing without of something, with the swearing off of the boycotted
product held up as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tangible proof to those who usually
supply the commodity that consumers are prepared to do without unless changes
are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made. What the gas-out calls for
isn&#39;t a swearing off of gasoline, but of buying gasoline, and that&#39;s a
key difference. The
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same amount of gas will be run
through the cars of the &quot;boycotters&quot; during the gas-out even if the gas
isn&#39;t purchased on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those days. Because consumers
aren&#39;t planning to do without gas, the threat is empty, and those who control
the taps will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know that. ...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895604626">BUT truly less gas will be consumed and more people will be aware I am sure<br/>
Susan (POD)....THink about it, if people are told NOT to buy gas they will <br/>
become more aware of the gas and the automobile they are driving and how <br/>
expensive it REALLY is....just that one trip they DO not make could add up <br/>
to a lot of gas NOT bought</div>
