<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473384417">The kids and I are taking violin lessons together (their request), <br/>
and they just started noticing violin/fiddle in music we hear on the <br/>
radio. They also saw the dynamic women fiddle players in a Lord of <br/>
the Dance DVD. So I&#39;ve started looking for songs and albums that have <br/>
fiddle and/or violin playing that we can listen to that will continue <br/>
to inspire us. I downloaded the MP3&#39;s for Charlie Daniel&#39;s &#39;The Devil <br/>
Went Down to Georgia&#39; and the fiddle duel from Lord of the Dance, but <br/>
if anyone has suggestions for other music that showcases the fiddle <br/>
or violin, I&#39;d love to hear them. I don&#39;t mind listening to different <br/>
genres.<br/>

McIsaac, both Canadians I might add, and the music is very fun.<br/>
