<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221300079">My daughter is making plans to fly to NYC for a week with her boyfriend next month. He has some good friends at NYU they can stay with.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has no fears about this at all, and encourages her to go and experience. I&#39;m trying to see it that way, but I&#39;m not having much success at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
