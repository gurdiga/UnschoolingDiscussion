Okay so the lightbulb just went off. Some things take me awhile. &lt;bg&gt; The <br/>
unschooling kids may very well try the exact same things that a lot of kids <br/>
do as teenagers, but it&#39;s what they do with that experience afterwards and <br/>
what they learn and how they handle it that makes a difference. So it makes <br/>
sense that I wasn&#39;t afraid of my child trying pot or a drink or some <br/>
physical intimacy, I was afraid of what all that would lead to. So seeing <br/>
how my children handle situations that are new and different will give me <br/>
the confidence to know they will handle teen things in the same manner. And <br/>
more importantly that I will give them the respect they have always gotten <br/>
in the past when new things arise in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m all better now.<br/>

  &gt;&gt;Has anyone run across any problems with unschooled children once they hit <br/>
  &gt;&gt;their teens and after? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I have one teen, Conor who is almost 14. I don&#39;t have problems with *him* at <br/>
  all. He&#39;s a good kid, very insightful, curious, and fairly open with me. <br/>
  That&#39;s not to say that he hasn&#39;t already experimented with a couple of <br/>
  things that I felt I (or his dad) needed to give him some guidance about. He <br/>
  has. But we don&#39;t freak out and we don&#39;t punish. We talk a lot, though. And <br/>
  we listen even more. And like Sandra said, we definitely don&#39;t sweat the <br/>
  small stuff.<br/>
<br/>
  Above all else, I think the most important thing to remember is that no <br/>
  matter what Conor may try, he is still the wonderful person I have known for <br/>
  14 years. That is Who He Is. The other stuff is just situations to deal <br/>

teens, Mary!!!<br/>
<br/>
The other thing nobody has mentioned is that they are busy in a way <br/>
schooled kids often are not - busy in &quot;real&quot; activities that they do <br/>
because they really enjoy doing them, as opposed to impressive <br/>
activities in order to pad their resume (college application).<br/>

Yes, and contrary to the dire predictions, I&#39;ve seen some of them REALLY <br/>
stick with projects for years.  If their lack of structure prevented that, we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t see any but the shortest dabbling projects.  And if they were just <br/>
doing it for the resume, school-style, one season of each thing might be more <br/>
impressive than years of one.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby goes to karate because he likes the camaraderie, he feels a loyalty to <br/>
the dojo, he likes the feeling of the workout, and he feels important there <br/>
because they give him real responsibilities.  He used to go to the gaming <br/>
shop regularly because he liked the games.  He helped out because he liked <br/>
the people there.  They gave him a job because he seemed responsible and <br/>
trustworthy.  That was two and a half years ago.  He didn&#39;t go there and help <br/>
in hopes that they would hire him.<br/>
<br/>
The dojo were he goes doesn&#39;t give black belts to anyone under 18, so his <br/>
future advancements are mapped out toward that goal.  At some point before <br/>
long  he&#39;ll advance to brown belt.  Because he&#39;s kept trying to figure out <br/>
ways to socialize with the other teens in his class (all very schooled and <br/>
with protective parents), I asked whether it would be appropriate for me to <br/>
invite people over after his belt test, kind of a reception.   Though I KNOW <br/>
he&#39;s been looking for a time and place and good reason for just socializing <br/>
with them, he said he didn&#39;t think that would be appropriate, since it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t seem in keeping with the humility that&#39;s supposed to be part of the <br/>
testing and advancement.<br/>
<br/>
High school tests, advancements, grades and graduations never seemed to find <br/>
any good place to work in &quot;humility,&quot; did they?  <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t know in advance what their hobbies and interests will lead to, but <br/>
if you try to direct them toward a goal in your own imagination, you can <br/>
certainly keep them from coming to the good places you were unable to foresee.<br/>
