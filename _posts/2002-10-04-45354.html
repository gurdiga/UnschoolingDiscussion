breastfeeding wrong because my son would not nurse through the chaos of the<br/>
meeting and cried instead.  In the end, I breastfed Tim about 1 1/2 years,<br/>
so I think I did well enough!  &lt;g&gt;  I went home and whined to my dh about it<br/>
for a few days, and then tripped over someone at church with teenagers who<br/>
long ago had been involved in LLL.  She became my support group instead.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, like most things run by volunteers, that quality varies, and<br/>
groups are subject to the personality of their leader.  I have no doubt that<br/>
LLL is a great organization.  It&#39;s too bad that less-supportive groups<br/>
exist, but maybe they still help some people.<br/>
