Headline:  Accountability for Home Schooling<br/>

In his response to homeschooling activist Christine Webb&#39;s June 23rd <br/>
letter to the Oregonian (noted here last issue), on June 28, Richard <br/>
A. Gano, a retired high school counselor, writes:  &quot;...students being <br/>
brought back into the school setting who had spent several years of <br/>
what I call &quot;No Schooling,&quot; ...and now it was the school&#39;s problem to <br/>
get them caught up.  If public schools are expected to be <br/>
accountable, so should home-schooling parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ann: Maybe this retired educator has forgotten that the public school <br/>
mandate is to offer appropriate education to students of every <br/>
ability, not just those who reach a certain level. As for <br/>
accountability, it makes no sense for homeschooling parents to be <br/>
accountable to a system that fails its enrolled students at such a <br/>
high rate.<br/>

HEM News & Commentary is a weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the <br/>
world of homeschooling. Gleanings from the news media, accolades and <br/>
pans, hot discussions, legal and legislative successes and problems - <br/>
all are fair game, and gathered in one column for your convenience.<br/>
<br/>
And just in case you don&#39;t have the time to read every word in print, <br/>
we will summarize and discuss key news and trends that we think are <br/>
the most provocative or that may have the greatest impact on the <br/>
future of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>

lists. You&#39;ll find a print version - the highlights of these reports <br/>
