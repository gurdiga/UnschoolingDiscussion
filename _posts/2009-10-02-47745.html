<br/>
Dear parents and mailing list administrator,<br/>
<br/>
I have been part of this list and I enjoy every experience shared...cannot<br/>
wait for sharing mine once the baby who is growing inside of me comes to be<br/>
part of my life. I will surely have so many challenges!  I am in a learning<br/>
stage now, so I have been keeping quiet and this is my first post.<br/>
<br/>
A bit about me and th ereason for this first post.<br/>
My name is Raquel. I come from rural Northern Spain. I have been living in<br/>
Shanghai,China for the last 8 years and abroad since 1992.<br/>
As a child I had an interest about what was going up out there, on the other<br/>
side of the mountain... and always longed to travel and know new cultures.<br/>
Learning English changed my life. Through the years, many other worlds and<br/>
experiences have been opened to me, in which the acquisition of new<br/>
languages played a key role. For some is music, for others business...I get<br/>
my pleasure from listening and understanding other cultures&#39; choices and<br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently pregnant with my first child. I have been reading a lot about<br/>
unschooling and it makes so much sense to me, that I cannot wait for my<br/>
child NOT to start school. Language learning has brought much joy in my<br/>
life. Being brought up in a remote area in a time where there were no<br/>
foreigners in my hometown, 2 TV channels and no exposure to foreign<br/>
languages, I was lucky to be pushed into a foreign language by the standard<br/>
national curriculum. So when I reflect on my own experience I feel grateful<br/>
for having had the chance of going to school. It is difficult for me to<br/>
grasp that what worked well on me 25 years ago is  not the best option TODAY<br/>
for my future child&#39;s development.<br/>
<br/>
At age 35 I am still looking for my passions (you know I was too busy<br/>
studying what I was supposed to be studying during 20+ years so my academic<br/>
background and my passions are definitely NOT in line....working on that<br/>
now). One of  my passions is foreign cultures (languages, traditions,<br/>
beliefs, religions,...) and the other one is knowing more about how our<br/>
brain learns. Taking those into account I decided to follow a master&#39;s<br/>
degree in teaching Spanish as a foreign language.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the course I will do a research. This research will help me<br/>
address several questions in my mind regarding my future maternity/raising<br/>
of unschooled children: how do unschoolers learn languages? where is their<br/>
motivation coming from? what methods/ means do they use?<br/>
<br/>
If you have time (where do parents get time from?) please take a few moments<br/>
to reflect on your child&#39;s foreign language learning by filling up my<br/>
research survey:<br/>

<br/>
Fell free to send the link to friends who might be willing to share their<br/>
experiences with me.<br/>
<br/>
I will be posting this link in several unschooling/parenting lists. I hope<br/>
it is not against the mailing list rules.<br/>
<br/>
I wished I could contribute to the unschooling community now with my<br/>
research and later with my own experiences as a mother.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks for your help.<br/>
<br/>
