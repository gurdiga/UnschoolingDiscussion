<br/>
Some people do.<br/>
<br/>
And the world DOES revolve around an infant.  He knows no world except his <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I realized, when I was looking for it, isn&#39;t online.  This <br/>
might not be the finally edited version, either, but it was in Home education <br/>
Magazine last spring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How Holly Takes the World for Granted<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a photo of me, with a column I wrote, in the November/December issue <br/>
of HEM.   Holly, at nine, took the photo. She took lots of me, with a <br/>
disposable camera, in a little wooded place of her  choosing.  She picked her <br/>
favorites, and we sent <br/>
them in. <br/>
<br/>
So I took the just-arrived issue to her and showed her the cover, and <br/>
then page 56, and said &quot;Look! They used one of <br/>
the pictures you took!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She looked at it, looked at me, smiled (somewhere <br/>
between wanly and half-heartedly) and said &quot;Cool! <br/>
Thanks for showing me that.&quot; And she went back to <br/>
the pattern-puzzle she was working in her lap (one <br/>
of those with the cars, I think—Rush Hour) and <br/>
the to TV show she was watching. <br/>
<br/>
Okay then. <br/>
<br/>
Being published in an international magazine <br/>
doesn&#39;t thrill her. It still thrills me when my <br/>
name&#39;s in the fine print in a regional newsletter, <br/>
so maybe I know how big the world is and she (at <br/>
nine) doesn&#39;t. Or maybe I&#39;m more easily thrilled. <br/>
<br/>
But I think Holly takes the world for granted. <br/>
And why not? The world is hers. <br/>
<br/>
The world wasn&#39;t mine when I was little. It <br/>
belonged to grownups, and I was told how to sit, <br/>
what to say, what to eat and how to hold the <br/>
spoon. I was told where to play, who with, and <br/>
how long. If I got dirty or tore my clothes I was <br/>
in trouble. I was told what was good and what was <br/>
bad. <br/>
<br/>
Holly takes the world for granted, and I&#39;m <br/>
thrilled about that. <br/>
<br/>
One of my online friends, Anne Ohman, wrote this and gave me permission to <br/>
quote it:  &quot;I know that when I sat in a Catholic church and the priest asked <br/>
me to repeat, &quot;Lord, I am not Worthy to Receive You...&quot; I knew it wasn&#39;t My <br/>
Truth. I HAD to believe I was worthy...even though this was the message I was <br/>
receiving everywhere...home, school, church...I just HAD to hold onto the <br/>
tiniest glimmer of Hope that I WAS worthy of the beautiful gifts of Life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember once I was a teenager, walking with several friends of mine, going <br/>
north on Lower San Pedro Road, which parallels the Rio Grande in Espanola.  <br/>
We were walking slowly, playing with sticks and rocks.  I don&#39;t remember what <br/>
the subject matter was, but I said &quot;I wonder how they do it in the REAL <br/>
world.&quot;  One of them said &quot;This IS the real world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t quite believe it.<br/>
<br/>
There I was with Jon Tsosie, from Santa Clara Pueblo, across the river;  and <br/>
DiAna Trujillo, whose dad was in the Bataan death march (yet living up the <br/>
road);  and I think John DePaula was there that day, whose dad was from <br/>
Queens, NY, and whose mom was from Trinidad, Colorado.  Maybe another kid or <br/>
two.  I thought the real world was far from us.  That we were spectators and <br/>
marginal not-even characters.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I thought that if you were good in school, you could grow up and become <br/>
a real adult with job.  And if you were good in New Mexico, you could grow up <br/>
and move to a more real place.  But somehow I had the idea that &quot;real&quot; was <br/>
elsewhere.  And &quot;important&quot; was not me.<br/>
<br/>
In the years since then I&#39;ve slowly grown to have a much different point of <br/>
view.  But in Holly, when I showed her that picture, I saw that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
worship &quot;elsewhere&quot; and she doesn&#39;t envy &quot;other.&quot;  She feels as real and as <br/>
right as rain.  &quot;As right as rain.&quot;   A natural, worthwhile, real part of <br/>
everything around her.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Mark grew up in North Dakota, and his relatives were of German <br/>
farming families.  They were Lutheran.  There was no nonsense.  The way that <br/>
Mark was put in his small place was that he was told &quot;You are full of <br/>
yourself.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t said in a positive or a good way.  It was intended to <br/>
be a deflating insult.  Mark doesn&#39;t have children, but we&#39;ve talked a lot <br/>
about being and having children.  He likes that my children are full of <br/>
themselves, and full of the whole world.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m jealous.  Sometimes I think that it&#39;s a bad thing that Holly <br/>
wasn&#39;t thrilled about being published.  Then I think that maybe the main <br/>
reason I am giddy at the idea of having my words in print is that it is <br/>
evidence of reality.  It means I am up and out of school, and I am no longer <br/>
just in New Mexico.  And then that awareness brings me full circle.  Holly <br/>
will not have to overcome the fear that she is unworthy.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one of the icons of hippiedom, the Desiderata.  It said &quot;You are a <br/>
child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.&quot;  That was a <br/>
radical thought in the 1960&#39;s, for some people.  Belonging naturally to all <br/>
that&#39;s around you.  Being as solid and as real as a tree.  <br/>
<br/>
This is what unschooling, though, has done for Holly.  She is not a student.  <br/>
She is Holly.  She is not a fourth grader.  She is Holly Dodd.  She has been <br/>
since birth, and she will be until or unless she decides to go by another <br/>
name, but that will be her decision.  The world is hers in a way that the <br/>
world has never been mine, not even now as an adult.  Sometimes I see myself <br/>
as a messy amalgamation of experiences, certificates, test scores and labels, <br/>
just come lately into the real world. <br/>
<br/>
I see my children living full, real lives today, right now.  I don&#39;t see them <br/>
as students in preparation for life, who after a number of years and lessons <br/>
might be considered &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;graduated.&quot;  It was a long way to come, <br/>
and I never even had to move.  I just had to look at what I considered to be <br/>
real.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Desiderata was written by Max Erhmann, and for those who missed it then <br/>
or had it then and have missed it since, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Desiderata<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in <br/>
silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all <br/>
persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others, even the <br/>
dull and ignorant; they too have their story. <br/>
<br/>
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexations to the spirit. If you <br/>
compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter, for always <br/>
there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your <br/>
achievements as well as your plans. <br/>
<br/>
Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession <br/>
in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, <br/>
for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue <br/>
there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of <br/>
heroism. <br/>
<br/>
Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about <br/>
love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as <br/>
the grass. <br/>
<br/>
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of <br/>
youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do <br/>
not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and <br/>
loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. <br/>
<br/>
You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You <br/>
have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the <br/>
universe is unfolding as it should. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive God to be; and whatever <br/>
your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with <br/>
your soul. <br/>
<br/>
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful <br/>
world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy. <br/>

This is so wonderful.     I hadn&#39;t read that before,  your article or The<br/>
Desiderata.   Coming from the same type of background  as Mark in your<br/>
article, I can relate.   It brings tears to my eyes.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Not at all.  But there is a time when everyone has to &quot;grow up&quot; - even slowly - and learn that they need to be independent at times.  <br/>

  &quot;How far back do you take that rationale, though?  To infancy?  Did you make <br/>
