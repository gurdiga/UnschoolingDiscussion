<div id="ygrps-yiv-918962078">Lynda- Actually we did a diet change after I researched the ADHD. Eventually <br/>
things calmed down with him. We eliminated alot of the enriched flours from <br/>
our diet, got rid of the Kraft maccaroni and cheese. Switched to Honey <br/>
instead of jellies. We had a decent diet, but I made some changes to things I <br/>
didnt know before. Like I didn&#39;t have any clue that white bread turns to <br/>
sugar once in our system. I dusted off my bread maker and started making <br/>
homemade whole weat unriched bread. I started using honey and maple to flavor <br/>
things instead of sugars, etc. He calmed down a bit, but we still have <br/>
situations. Today for instance. He was out just plain picking fights. Nothign <br/>
really violent, but definately picking fights. He&#39;s been through so much, but <br/>
I do hope that one day he can figure out how to heal enough that he&#39;s not so <br/>
angry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556636765">One of the things we did for the kids who came to the rehab center was to<br/>
have their bedrooms made into a &quot;soft&quot; place.  Soft colors, no sharp corners<br/>
(futons, bean bags, no dressers unless they were put in a closet), soft<br/>
fluffy rugs,  muted lights and a stereo with their choice of &quot;soft&quot; music.<br/>
We found that if the kids had a &quot;soft&quot; place to go to when they became<br/>
stressed that they could learn relaxation techniques that would help them<br/>
unwind.<br/>

everything from his room except his matress. I took their advise. I was so <br/>
scared he was going to hurt himself. After he bashed out his bedroom windows <br/>
he tried to &quot;fix&quot; his wndows by using shaving cream and rubbing the shaving <br/>
cream on his window. Needless to say he cut himself. I didn&#39;t know until <br/>
later that he had even busted the windows. He also has been urinating <br/>
throughout the house. Not like the urinating on accident in his pants. Rather <br/>
he&#39;ll walk through the house past the bathroom and into another room, go into <br/>
a corner or the edge of the couch, pull down his pants, and urinate. Ever <br/>
since he was at the abusive school he had bm accidents. He still has these <br/>
but not nearly as often. Back when he was attending the abusive school he was <br/>
having about 6 accidents a day. Now he goes over week or so between them. <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll have days where he&#39;ll have maybe two for 3 days in a row, but <br/>
between these he&#39;ll go weeks. <br/>

ever heard of the PRICE parenting before? I&#39;m willing to go and see what it&#39;s <br/>
about. It&#39;s hard at times knowing how to respond to my sons behaviors. I&#39;m <br/>
trying hard to let go of being authoritarian toward him, but it&#39;s hard to sit <br/>
back and watch him being violent toward others.<br/>

Carbohydrates do that.  Not just white bread.<br/>
It&#39;s not unnatural.  Sugar isn&#39;t evil incarnate.<br/>
<br/>
Eliminating any portion of our diet is going to bring problems, even sugar, <br/>
even oils.<br/>

A big group of friends of ours went jointly on a no-carbohydrate, no-sugar <br/>
diet for a while a couple of years back.  Lots lost weight.  ALL got mean, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975914621">The problem with any of the fad diets is that the zero in on one element.<br/>
<br/>
If one is going to remove sugar from the diet, remove refined sugar.  It is<br/>
worthless calories and has enough chemicals in it to float a boat,<br/>
figurativly speaking, of course.<br/>
<br/>
There are many options out there including an organic sugar that isn&#39;t<br/>
refined and no chemicals are used to process the sugar cane or sugar beets<br/>
depending on which type you decide to use.<br/>
<br/>
The are also &quot;good&quot; carbohydrates and &quot;not so good&quot; such as the old fluffy<br/>
white bread.  If one bakes their own bread from a whole wheat organic flour<br/>
then you know what is in it and that there is some nutritional value.<br/>
<br/>
It is the same with all the fast fixes in the supermarkets.  The kidlets<br/>
love the old Bryers commercial which kinda translates to if the list of<br/>
ingredients is book length and you can read the words, don&#39;t eat it.<br/>
<br/>
There are several studies going on right now that are all coming to the same<br/>
conclusion, if you revert to the diet of your ethnic ancestry you will have<br/>
less problems with heart disease and things like diabetes.  Studies also<br/>
show that you will have less allergies if you eat not only organic but<br/>
locally grown.<br/>
<br/>
We started this &quot;journey&quot; to healthier living way back when with the older<br/>
boys and then really got into it when hubby was diagnosed with cancer.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure who was on the computer more, the kidlets or me but now when we go<br/>
to a store they read labels and they put things back faster than I do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-177032663">It is drizzly here today. Rained all night.  More rain<br/>
expected. Steamy, misty...ethereal.<br/>
<br/>
But<br/>
My consumer habits are now a source of guilt, in light<br/>
of yesterday&#39;s horror.  Is it too selfish to use the<br/>
dryer? I was just about to order some new boots. What<br/>
about the good, but expensive, mail order coffee I<br/>
drink with half and half and sugar? More internal<br/>
CHORES for me to do. I was complacently thinking that<br/>
I was doing OK in consuming of resources.....  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if a similar post shows up. I sent two posts out<br/>
about an hour ago...maybe? Had to go do some<br/>
&quot;maintenance&quot;, and checked back....<br/>
<br/>
DS4 is driving me nuts thinking up more uses for the<br/>
tiny little rotory tool I bought. He had thought to<br/>
sand his work table with it. He did have some other<br/>
more appropriate uses for the tool. Perhaps he is just<br/>
checking to see if I&#39;m paying attention? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched more TV in the last day than I ever<br/>
have!!DS keeps saying &quot;Can&#39;t we turn if off now?&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s a change!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; DS4 is driving me nuts thinking up more uses for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tiny little rotory tool I bought. He had thought to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sand his work table with it. He did have some other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more appropriate uses for the tool. Perhaps he is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; checking to see if I&#39;m paying attention? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My sister lives near a large outcropping of limestone.  When she is<br/>
&gt;bored, she grabs up her little Dremmel (sp?) tool and off she goes.  In a<br/>
&gt;few years some bright archaeologist will find her  aliens and space ships<br/>
&gt;  and geometric shapes and think the natives used to be visited by people<br/>
&gt;from another land.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not suggesting your son become a vandal but maybe some of that house<br/>
&gt;stucco spread out  ( thickly ) on a sheet of ply wood  could be a canvas<br/>
&gt;for cave art.<br/>
&gt;Or is this the kind of thing you were hoping to avoid? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, not trying to avoid that sort of thing....just<br/>
that the sanding attachment is very, very tiny. Meant<br/>
for little stuff....not big plywood tables.  We have<br/>
big sand paper for that. <br/>
....and I want a turn for myself!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642367383">Hubby was reading this over my shoulder and he said you might check with<br/>
your local cemetary or headstone carver.  Sometimes they have chips of<br/>
various stones that they will give to kids.  He says that is where he got<br/>
some of the stones that the kidlets tumbeled to make marble eggs.<br/>
