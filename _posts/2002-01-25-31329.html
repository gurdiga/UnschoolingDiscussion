&gt;<br/>
&gt; + Problem though: In RSA one is supposed to be learning at least 2<br/>
&gt; + languages,<br/>
&gt; + and they should be official languages, ie English, Afrikaans and/or one of<br/>
&gt; + the African languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are those your only choices?  In Oklahoma, they have changed this<br/>
&gt; requirement and there are some other, more unusual choices.  I&#39;m doing this<br/>
&gt; from memory, but I&#39;m pretty sure computer languages qualifies.  And I know<br/>
&gt; that American Sign Language qualifies.  What is &quot;RSA&quot; anyway?<br/>
