<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619947528">Well, in the middle of our first week my daughter came up with this one <br/>
today......<br/>
<br/>
I asked, &quot;Could you help my out and empty the dishwasher (she is 15).<br/>
I was prepared for the no I don&#39;t feel like it or don&#39;t want to.<br/>
She says &quot;I don&#39;t have to you&#39;ll do anything I don&#39;t want to do so why should <br/>
I.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wasnt ready for that one.  <br/>
<br/>
I told her she was right she didn&#39;t have to do it, but later when she wanted <br/>
me to do something for her I may be emptying the dish washer and she would <br/>
have to wait till I finished before I could take her to the mall or what <br/>
ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Her thinking was that at anytime I should drop everything for her (yes she <br/>
has a brother I help out too.) when she want that moment.  I tried to explain <br/>
that I needed to get certain things done around the house before I felt good <br/>
about leaving and if she helped it would be sooner if not I would do take her <br/>
when I finished.<br/>
<br/>
then later that day she expected her brother to get off the tv so she could <br/>
watch a show.  I told she could ask him but not demand that he get off, he <br/>
was there and when he finished she could have the tv. <br/>
<br/>
it seems we are just starting and everything for her is me me me, is this <br/>
normal.  My 7 year old is easing into this much better.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that it ever goes completely away.  Lanora still asks for<br/>
things that mean someone else has to give up what they are doing.  I just<br/>
tell her she can ask but it doesn&#39;t mean they have to comply and that I<br/>
think it would be good to think about what she&#39;s asking from the other<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly enough, Jonathan will comply sometimes, no matter unreasonable<br/>
I think she&#39;s being.  Maybe he knows something I don&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can be part of teenage thinking. If she didn&#39;t express it before, I<br/>
suspect she was still thinking it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember thinking that way. It was like the rest of the world didn&#39;t have<br/>
needs. Everyone was just doing what they wanted. I was the only one with<br/>
needs and was baffled why the world couldn&#39;t understand that and tend to<br/>
them ;-)<br/>
