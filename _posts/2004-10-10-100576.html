&lt;&lt; I think what some people who have rejected conventional parenting and<br/>
are looking for something to replace it with hear is &quot;Put yourself aside and<br/>
put your children first.&quot;<br/>
&lt;&lt;Which is no better! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think as &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; go, it&#39;s better.  <br/>
It&#39;s still not perfect, but the balance should go toward the child in cases <br/>
of indecision, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard parents say they want a 50/50 deal with a child (or more often, <br/>
with a husband or a friend).   Few relationships are 50/50 and none are 50/50 in <br/>
every aspect.<br/>
<br/>
I do some car repair and Keith does some sewing, but neither of those is <br/>
50/50.<br/>
<br/>
In matters of fun and food and sleep and what channel to watch, if an adult <br/>
will not give more than 50%, a child without skills and power will lose a lot.<br/>
<br/>
What I have seen that was unFOREseen (for me, maybe not for everyone) is the <br/>
huge change in peace in progress that can come when parents DO attend heavily <br/>
to their child&#39;s whims and interests and curiosities.   <br/>
<br/>
Some of that is attested to here, by people who were so joyous they shared it <br/>
in public (many on this list, but not all):<br/>
