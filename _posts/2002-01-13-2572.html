<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927478183">little basis in evidential fact makes me feel creepy.... Mathematically<br/>
speaking,.......Sandra Dodd...<br/>
<br/>
Somebody once wrote &quot;Science is nothing more than a modern<br/>
superstition&quot;.....  I like this.<br/>
<br/>
I know you didn&#39;t mention Astrology, but mentioned Tarot so I just wanted to<br/>
make it clear that Astrology is a Science.  Astronomy and Astrology were one<br/>
and the same up until the Age of Enlightenment.  Astrology is also<br/>
Mathematical.  Astrology has been documented 5000 BC and was mentioned<br/>
profusely in the original books now known as the Bible...  Of course this is<br/>
a very different metaphysical discipline than Tarot.  As a Professional<br/>
Certified Tarot Instructor it would be very unprofessional to tell people<br/>
they&#39;ve been with people in another life, or to imply something is likely to<br/>
happen in the future.  I think those are called Fortune Tellers and are<br/>
illegal in many states.  The job of a Professional Tarot Reader is to<br/>
feedback to you hidden matters that the individual needs to work on within<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As for evidence it&#39;s only the scientific community that doesn&#39;t recognize<br/>
the 6th sense as scientific.  I think it&#39;s more about fear.  I can only<br/>
speak for myself but I have on tape in November of last year talking about<br/>
George Bush and Al Gore and how George Bush would be the better candidate<br/>
for WHEN we went to war.  One of the guys on the radio said &quot;don&#39;t you mean<br/>
IF we went to war&quot; and I said &quot;sorry for some reason WHEN seemed to fit the<br/>
bill more than IF&quot;..... I also said, again on tape prior to the event &quot;Al<br/>
Gore for some reason will have a hard time leaving the White House, but I<br/>
can&#39;t figure out why&quot;.... Well now we know why....<br/>
<br/>
When JFK Jr&#39;s airplane went down, the week before, again on tape we were<br/>
talking about the Kennedy&#39;s on the radio.  I said &quot;that John Jr needed to be<br/>
careful flying his airplane especially because of where Mars and Pluto were<br/>
transiting in his chart&quot;.... I forgot about it until I turn on the<br/>
television on a Saturday morning which staying at a hotel with hubby only to<br/>
see all this news coverage of his downed airplane.<br/>
<br/>
So what kind of evidence should there be and was that just lucky guesswork<br/>
on my part?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a family of psychics and Tarot Readers so for me I find it<br/>
really strange that everyone doesn&#39;t read cards.  It must be really unusual<br/>
not to have Tarot Cards around and for conversations in the family to center<br/>
around the 6th sense and what we are learning with that part of the brain.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s more about evidence.  What evidence is there that the 6th sense<br/>
exists?  You yourself admitted that all those events you predicted could<br/>
have been coincidence.  You may not think they were coincidence, but you<br/>
can&#39;t prove they weren&#39;t.  And it&#39;s no good saying that I can&#39;t prove<br/>
that they *were* coincidence either.  If you want to establish something<br/>
as a fact, the burden of proof lies on showing that the extraordinary<br/>
*does* exist and *not* on proving that it can&#39;t exist.      <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And if there are hundreds of people making predictions then some of them are<br/>
bound to be right.<br/>
<br/>
How many predictions have you made that didn&#39;t pan out?<br/>
<br/>
I think if we all grew up in an atmosphere of believing that there were<br/>
psychic energies we could tap into that we would be in the habit of making<br/>
predictions and would gain confidence in our ability to tap the psychic<br/>
energy when some of those prediction by chance happened to match reality. As<br/>
chance brought us more &quot;right&quot; predictions our confidence in our abilities<br/>
would grow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that as a way of saying you&#39;re full of hooey. Just saying<br/>
this is why it feels right to believe it.<br/>
<br/>
If we were to collect all the &quot;psychic predictions&quot; about bin Laden (for<br/>
example) and then review them after he&#39;s discovered or killed or captured,<br/>
some of them by pure chance will be right. Most will be wrong of course. Are<br/>
the right ones psychic or just lucky guessers?<br/>
<br/>
I recall in statistics class the teacher told us of a scam where a &quot;stock<br/>
predictor&quot; would write the same letter to a hundred people saying Stock A<br/>
will go up and another hundred that Stock A will go down. Depending on<br/>
whether Stock A goes up or down, he chooses the hundred he made the right<br/>
&quot;prediction&quot; to and to half writes that Stock B will go up and half that<br/>
Stock B will go down. If he keeps on doing this with Stocks C, D, E and so<br/>
forth, eventually there will be a handful of people who have proof in<br/>
writing that the guy is dead on accurate at predicting stocks! ;-) And then<br/>
send him lots of money to invest of course!<br/>
<br/>
There was also an experiment with pigeons where the scientists would<br/>
randomly deliver food to pigeons who were in separate cages. After some time<br/>
passed the scientists checked on the pigeons and they were all doing odd<br/>
things -- hopping on one leg, bobbing their heads, flapping their wings and<br/>
so on. They were behaviors the pigeons just happened to be doing when food<br/>
appeared. Food reinforced the vague idea that the behavior was associated<br/>
with food which made the pigeons slightly more likely to do that behavior.<br/>
Since they would do the behavior more often, chance would coincide the<br/>
delivery of food with the behavior more often. Which increased the frequency<br/>
of the behavior until the pigeons were certain the behavior was bringing the<br/>
food. Since the food delivery was random, the behavior didn&#39;t always bring<br/>
food, but it was reinforced often enough that to the pigeons there seemed to<br/>
be a connection.<br/>

credit! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The only thing my pigeon is certain of is that he is invisible to cats. <br/>
