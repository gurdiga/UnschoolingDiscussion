<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146366286">Here is another interesting article...I think this speak directly to how <br/>
school damages our boys.  I would wager few unschooling/homeschooling parents <br/>
see this kind of extreme behavior and thought patterns in their sons...it is <br/>
social conditioning in the classrooms that is not working for our sons.<br/>

be one who feels the need to overpower someone, especially women in order to <br/>
feel ok.   <br/>

Official: boys can&#39;t help being macho<br/>
 <br/>
Research finds youths can&#39;t resist being bad even though they know the <br/>
consequencesJenifer Johnston<br/>
 <br/>
Teenage boys deliberately underperform at school, adopt anti-social traits <br/>
and commit criminal offences even though they know it affects their career <br/>
prospects and damages their relationships with friends and family.New <br/>
research published by the British Psychological Soc iety found that boys <br/>
cannot shake off the pressure to conform to a &#39;macho&#39; blueprint.The findings <br/>
are the result of an extensive six-year study of boys aged 11 to 14.The boys <br/>
were asked about themselves, their peers and the way they are perceived. Most <br/>
said that they thought being strong academically was &#39;gay&#39; or &#39;girly&#39;. <br/>
However, in individual interviews, boys said they were anxious about not <br/>
making the grade and many were resentful towards teachers who they said <br/>
favoured girls.Being &#39;hard&#39; or &#39;cool&#39; was also very important, and <br/>
researchers discovered that popularity was often gauged on how tough or <br/>
anti-adult individuals appeared. Football, whether following a team or <br/>
playing the sport, was an important topic for many who were interviewed and <br/>
an indicator of how masculine an individual was considered to be. The &#39;absent <br/>
father&#39; syndrome was also apparent -- a third specifically mentioned that <br/>
their mothers were more available to them than their fathers. It is hoped <br/>
that the results will help influence teachers and social policy <br/>
makers.Professor Stephen Frosh, who led the research, said the results showed <br/>
that boys had a lot to offer when given the chance. He said: &#39;On their own, <br/>
they were surprisingly willing to be truthful and thoughtful about their <br/>
relation ships and problems. &#39;Boys have a lot of confusion about how to get <br/>
what they want and still keep their masculine image.&#39;Boys are much more artic <br/>
ulate than they are given credit for and there are lessons to be learned <br/>
there for social policy makers. Instead of always pushing boys towards sport, <br/>
they should be given a way to do well academically without stigma.&#39; A <br/>
spokesman for the Educ ational Institute of Scotland said the research <br/>
highlighted the problems that boys can suffer in the classroom. He said: &#39;For <br/>
a number of years, the issue of maintaining the interest of teenage boys in <br/>
education has been recognised as a problem area. &#39;Different rates of matur <br/>
ation, peer group pressure and the perception that learning is not a <br/>
masculine activity can all contribute to boys being left behind in comparison <br/>
to girls.&#39;Alleviating the shortage of male role models in education -- both <br/>
at home and in the classroom, including the shortage of male teachers -- <br/>
could go some way towards tackling the problem and help close the gender gap <br/>
which currently exists.&#39;Anne Houston, director of ChildLine Scotland, said <br/>
the research supported the organisation&#39;s efforts to encourage boys to open <br/>
up -- even at an early age. &#39;We receive three times as many calls from girls <br/>
as we do from boys,&#39; she said. &#39;They need to know it is okay to talk about <br/>
their problems. &#39;Boys seem to wait for help to come to them, leading to <br/>
frustration in a lot of cases, and they act it out by getting into trouble. <br/>
&#39;From very early, boys bottle problems up and don&#39;t reach out for help, which <br/>
sadly is a precursor to the very high number of suicides we see in young <br/>
men.&#39;Dr Mark Hamilton, co- presenter of the Radio One Sunday Surgery <br/>
programme, said the study results did not surprise him. &#39;This mirrors what I <br/>
remember from my peer group,&#39; he said. &#39;Something that continually baffles me <br/>
is that boys stick to the rebel image, but society emulates the rebels. &#39;In <br/>
terms of education, it makes it very difficult for boys to concentrate on <br/>
their work when they are nervous about being labelled a geek or a swot.&#39;<br/>
