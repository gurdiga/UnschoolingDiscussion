<div id="ygrps-yiv-502683914">Yikes!!!! Jinger, I went and looked at that site and was horrified to <br/>
discover it comes from our city!! Then I remembered a few years a go my psycho <br/>
sister-in-law was up with my brother, and went to visit her friend here in town. She <br/>
brought home with her a prototype of this monstrosity you discovered!!! She <br/>
showed it to me and I managed to avoid discussing it, I found it horrid to say <br/>
the least. <br/>
I am so embarrassed for our fair city to be the source of this, and this <br/>
woman who does it is some sort of school counsellor or something I think.<br/>
EEEEWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
