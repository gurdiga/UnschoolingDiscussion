<div id="ygrps-yiv-847880807">i was just joking about calling you guys &quot;addicts&quot;.  i was poking fun<br/>
at the seriousness with which people (mostly me) take the television<br/>
issue.  i admire anyone who can have a tv and not use it addictively.<br/>
<br/>
the reason i am here is beause i emulate you all to some degree.  you<br/>
have to understand that up until last week, i have NEVER met anyone<br/>
who thought that unrestricting tv was okay who also was of an<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; bent.  (that may be because i live in the boonies, it<br/>
may be because i am a new mother).  you make me feel like one of those<br/>
hyper-controlling parents, who stops her kid from exploring the world<br/>
and learing things, when everyone on my block and my parents seems to<br/>
think that i have a real problem because i can&#39;t seem to tell my<br/>
daughter &quot;what to do&quot;.  the absurdity of this paradox makes me laugh.<br/>
<br/>
i know now, at least, that my problem with what to do about television<br/>
has everything to do with me and how i was raised, and not that much<br/>
to do with my daughter.  it doesn&#39;t make the issues any easier for me,<br/>
though.  i don&#39;t know if this makes sense to you, but watching tv for<br/>
me is like using a drug.  it is a way of escaping.  of course it is<br/>
because of the way i was raised, but i feel like my life is under<br/>
control and i am a better mother when there is no tv in my house.<br/>
what you have so kindly pointed out (and not so kindly) is that this<br/>
might work when there is a baby in my arms but not for a 4 year old<br/>
who really wants to watch television.<br/>
<br/>
but i did think the southpark create a character thing was pretty<br/>
funny.  my friend sent me the link and he&#39;d made a whole series of<br/>
portraits of people we know.<br/>

I know what you mean, Jana.  I&#39;m told by various people that I&#39;m <br/>
overprotective of my kids (and don&#39;t want them to grow up) because <br/>
they don&#39;t go to school, but then I&#39;m blasted by someone else <br/>
for &quot;letting&quot; my kids climb tall trees and go away to skateboard <br/>
camp.<br/>
You definitely can&#39;t please all people all of the time. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you think that mabye this is because of your bad feelings about <br/>
television in general that make you feel &quot;guilty&quot; for wanting to <br/>
watch it?  Like it&#39;s not the tv that&#39;s causing the problem so much <br/>
as your conflicting feelings about it?  (Meaning you feel suspicious <br/>
and fearful of tv as a medium but you still like to watch it.)<br/>
I&#39;m the opposite of you in this respect.  I&#39;m not suspicious of tv <br/>
any longer and no longer feel any guilt when I watch, nor do I feel <br/>
morally superior when I choose not to watch.  But at the same time, <br/>
since I&#39;ve come to change my mind about tv, I don&#39;t watch anywhere <br/>
near as much as I did when I was having that inner battle.  I think <br/>
it has to do with no longer coercing myself about tv along with my <br/>
children.<br/>
I&#39;m *really* glad I let go of all those fears and doubts about it.<br/>
Those feelings gave tv way too much power in our lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is the difficulty my daughter has had with the TV issue.  She<br/>
lived with her TV-watching father from the age of 4 to 15.  TV *is* an<br/>
escape for him and became one for her too.  There was nothing going on in<br/>
that house except TV.  She resisted getting one for years because she felt<br/>
she would watch it too much herself, as well as for all the other<br/>
&quot;protective of her children&quot; reasons.  (A year ago I would have laughed<br/>
hysterically if anyone said *I* was going to be encouraging my daughter to<br/>
get a TV.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing you might consider is putting the TV in a place that would be<br/>
uncomfortable *for you* rather than uncomfortable for the people in your<br/>
family who want to watch it.  (That&#39;s if you&#39;re the one who put it in the<br/>
cold basement.  I don&#39;t remember now.)  Then you&#39;d be less tempted yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the club! I too have had to wrap my mind around the fact that I was<br/>
being very controlling when it came to tv and food...something that I did not<br/>
really see before coming here. Most of my friends think that I am too &quot;easy&quot;<br/>
on the boys and not controlling enough. And here were a bunch of folks that really<br/>
made me look at the few areas in which I was controlling...very eye opening.<br/>
<br/>
But several months into it and I have to say that I am very glad to have had this<br/>
pointed out to me. It has changed the way that I interact with my boys for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Keep reading and thinking. You will be amazed where it takes you...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216087133">I was never suspicious of TV, but I definitely used to feel guilty about<br/>
watching it. I felt like I was wasting my time. (Just ask my mom, TV is<br/>
a waste of time.) And I felt even more guilty letting my children watch<br/>
it.  Thanks to this list, I was totally able to let that go.  We enjoy<br/>
TV when we watch it now.   My kids have free reign to watch how much TV<br/>
they would like, but more often than not, the TV is off.  We just have<br/>
better things to do most of the time.  The times we really enjoy it  are<br/>
in the late afternoon or evening on days when we are tired.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t regulate a lot in my children&#39;s lives anymore, but TV was one of<br/>
the last things I was able to let go of.  I am so happy that I did.  It<br/>
is so nice to not be the TV police and to have the children watch only<br/>
what they really want to watch, not just watch because they are given an<br/>
hour per day.  When they were given an hour per day, the never missed<br/>
it.  Now we go days without watching TV because we are too busy having<br/>
fun TV doesn&#39;t have a hold on us.<br/>
