<div id="ygrps-yiv-917917257">sorry about my last two posts. I forgot to change the sub line.<br/>
<br/>
This post reminds me of one of my best friends. Her house was always such a <br/>
shambles, which I (and she) always attributed to a passel of boys and their <br/>
uber creative ways of messing things up. Hers was also the &quot;neighborhood <br/>
hangout&quot; which is how she wanted it. Now she&#39;s divorced and has a place of <br/>
her own, and except for the front room usually being presentable...it&#39;s very <br/>
similar to what it was when it was full of kids.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* I&#39;m neater than this. guess I&#39;ll know when the kids move out.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My mother retired, and lives alone.  A few years after her retirement,  <br/>
&gt;while<br/>
&gt;I was visiting she said, &quot;I used to think you kids were the reason the  <br/>
&gt;house<br/>
&gt;was always a mess.  Now I realize it was ME all along!&quot;   :)<br/>
