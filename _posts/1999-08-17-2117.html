<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108583355">I think sibling fighting is a really difficult issue.  I know most of the<br/>
&#39;school moms&#39; around here are eagerly anticipating the start of school so<br/>
they can separate the siblings!<br/>
My three do have their moments/days;  but overall,  they seem to do fine<br/>
with each other.  I have wondered if schooling fosters sibling rivalry --<br/>
with the separation into age groups and the peer pressure to be &#39;cool&#39;.  I<br/>
wonder if the parent&#39;s frustration comes in part from the pressure about<br/>
beginning the school year and hoping your child will &#39;measure up&#39; , make<br/>
friends,  etc.  And if the children fight more knowing their time will be so<br/>
scheduled, the homework battles will begin, etc.<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t come close to answering your questions.... :-(<br/>
Have you seen the books  Siblings Without Rivalry   and  How to Talk So Your<br/>
Child Will Listen And Listen So Your Child Will Talk  ?<br/>
It&#39;s a tough balance between letting them work it out on their own and<br/>
intervening to mediate.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
