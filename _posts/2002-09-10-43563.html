<br/>
I didn&#39;t use those words at first, but looking back I saw that that&#39;s what <br/>
was having the greatest effect.  The past couple of years I&#39;ve sometimes the <br/>
same vocabulary used in American-Buddhist counseling to talk about what helps <br/>
unschooling become established.  And it&#39;s BEING with your children.  Being <br/>
WITH is the more common emphasis on the thought, in our culture.  Heavy on <br/>
the &quot;with.&quot;   But heavier on the BEING is an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Now those who think the difference between teach and learn is worthless will <br/>
think I&#39;m REALLY nuts, making a distinction between &quot;*being* with your child&quot; <br/>
and &quot;being *with* your child.&quot;  But I can&#39;t help it.  Any kid of being with <br/>
helps, though.  <br/>
<br/>
My best current already-written thing on that is<br/>

While they have some whacked out ideas about separation, etc.- can be<br/>
very helpful in explaining developmental issues. I always benefited from<br/>
reading them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a couple of those, and it WAS helpful.  Because knowing child <br/>
development from the overall, summary level is fine, but to see a BUNCH of <br/>
traits and liklihoods and &quot;normalcies&quot; all put in one place helped remind me <br/>
that it&#39;s the whole large package of what Piaget and Maslow and Freud and <br/>
Jung and ALL those guys predicted or observed or measured all poured into one <br/>
forty-pound package sometimes that makes the squirmy reality not look like <br/>
the text book.  <br/>
<br/>
When my kids were first ever going to be around younger kids I would remind <br/>
them what that kid could or couldn&#39;t or might like to do, what would be too <br/>
much, what would be dangerous.   Once we went to a barbecue where we knew <br/>
only one other person.  There was an autistic boy, about eight years old.  <br/>
Kirby and Marty were about six and nine.   They asked me quietly what was <br/>
wrong with that boy, because he wasn&#39;t playing with them the way they <br/>
expected him to.  I told them he had a condition that made him afraid of some <br/>
things, and if they played with him more like they play with Holly it would <br/>
probably work better.    It wasn&#39;t the most perfect of explanations, but they <br/>
were little, and said &quot;Okay!&quot; and zipped back out to the swings and the big <br/>
yard.  Holly was three.  That was the day she got the 18-or-so mosquito bites <br/>
which got badly infected and we figured out she should NOT play near the Rio <br/>
Grande in the summer for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
So they played with him and didn&#39;t get grumpy when he wouldn&#39;t give the <br/>
playground ball back, and they didn&#39;t swing so high when he yelled &quot;Too HIGH <br/>
too HIGH&quot; even though it was them swinging and not him, because they were <br/>
used to being nice to Holly and other little kids.<br/>
<br/>
When we were leaving, his mom followed me out of the house and out of the y<br/>
ard, to tell me with tears in her eyes that my boys had played with her son <br/>
nicer than anyone ever had before.  I told her they had never been to school, <br/>
so they were fine with people being different.  She was really kind of <br/>
overwhelmed, emotionally, by how well the afternoon had gone.<br/>
<br/>
She and most of the women there were special ed teachers in the public <br/>
schools.  I had never said, in their conversations, that I had taught, nor <br/>
said anything about homeschooling.  I just let them go on and on and I went <br/>
out and helped with food and the kids.   <br/>
<br/>
There had been a big toad in the yard,  and I caught it so the kids could see <br/>
it and touch it.  One of the moms started shrieking (not quite screaming, but <br/>
not just yelling) that it might be POISONOUS!!!   She had an east-coast <br/>
accent, and I grew up by the Rio Grande, and so she didn&#39;t slow me down a <br/>
bit, and I reassured her calmly that they are not poisonous.  All the kids <br/>
got to hold it, feel its feet, touch its belly, look at its eyes, feel its <br/>
heart beat, and we let it into the orchard toward the river.  I told the kids <br/>
they don&#39;t swim, but they like to be near the muddy places to eat the bugs.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a group of people I was interested in socializing any further, but <br/>
my kids did make a good impression on them, and probably changed the view of <br/>
homeschoolers for half a dozen teachers for life.<br/>
<br/>
What was the point? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  The autistic child wouldn&#39;t have been in the normal range for his age in <br/>
the &quot;your seven year old&quot; books, but because my kids were aware that there <br/>
are some things younger kids are still not good at and they were able to <br/>
treat him as being at an earlier developmental stage, it worked out.<br/>

     It&#39;s very hard when you go to school and see someone &quot;different&quot; <br/>
from you.  My nephew is 7 y/o and has cerebral palsy.  Sarah (9) has <br/>
no problems with him being different.  He&#39;s just her cousin. <br/>

my husband and I do these kinds of things with our children too. The only <br/>
thing that bothered me was the part about yard sale puzzles missing a piece <br/>
or two. I&#39;ve actually thrown out puzzles for just missing one piece. It <br/>
bothers the daylights out of me. I guess I&#39;m real anal about that!!!<br/>
<br/>
While I was reading it, Joseph and Sierra came to read over my sholder and <br/>
saw the picture of the puzzle and off they went to the puzzle cabinet and <br/>
have been busy ever since. I also got down some old little kid puzzles for <br/>
the Alyssa. Been quiet for awhile now!!<br/>

Ames (??). Short books - he might really enjoy reading about or hearing bits <br/>
about the typical characteristics of 3 year olds -- the nice thing is that <br/>
when he sees them in action he can feel so proud of himself that he <br/>
UNDERSTANDS that this is normal child development. Bet he&#39;d want to read <br/>
&quot;Your 8 Year Old&quot; too, and that could be really interesting for him -- <br/>
encourage self-reflection, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hope those books still exist - its been more than 15 years since I looked at <br/>
one -- but there are surely some out there.<br/>

help my 4 year old has become pretty good at self soothing skills.  As with <br/>
any book, though, take it with a grain of salt.  What child wouldn&#39;t, unless <br/>
stopped by a care giver, want to examine the rainbow made in an oily puddle?  <br/>
The book really helped me to cue in on Nathan&#39;s skin sensitivities.  All <br/>
sensory sensitivities, actually.<br/>
<br/>
I also really liked The Encouraging Parent, although we aren&#39;t at an age <br/>
where his prescribed &quot;discipline&quot; made any sense and I&#39;m not sure we would <br/>
use it.<br/>
