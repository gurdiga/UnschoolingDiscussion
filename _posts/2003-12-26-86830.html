&lt;&lt; One<br/>
of the earliest parenting advice articles I ever read said to beware of<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t let me CATCH you doing ...&quot; statements, since it was a mixed message<br/>
that could be taken as a challenge. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I better not ever see you doing X&quot; seems like a clear message to me.  We had <br/>
friends who did that.  Their kids were HORRIBLE when the parents were gone, <br/>
and statuesque when they were there.  Military &quot;yes sir/no sir&quot; statues who <br/>
never did anything questionable.   It was as though they were holding their <br/>
breath in the presence of their dad, and when they hear the engine of his car, they <br/>
let loose everything they had been holding in, and they weren&#39;t breaking any <br/>
rules by doing that.   Their understanding of the rule was correct:  They <br/>
couldn&#39;t do it where their dad could see them.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has to pay a quarter for an offense, the offense has to be proven. <br/>
 <br/>
If the offense can be hidden, that saves 25cents.  Bad set-up.<br/>
<br/>
I could have told that dad what his kids were doing at my house, but I <br/>
decided not to.  They would have been punished beyond what it was worth, so I just <br/>
made deals with them myself, and explained in my own way what it would cost <br/>
them in terms of behavior and consideration if they wanted to play at my house.  <br/>
And they did want to, and they did things my way at my house, which also <br/>
involved them saying &quot;okay&quot; and calling me Sandra instead of using their Alabama <br/>
manners which only reminded me that they had a whole arsenal of behavioral tools <br/>
which had no room left for real consideration of why things were done how, <br/>
and forms of address which excused them from deciding which people they REALLY <br/>
respected or didn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470660867">This &quot;type&quot; of parenting made me think of a program that has recently been <br/>
started at my oldest son&#39;s high school.    A few months ago, a freshman girl was <br/>
killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver.  She and a couple other <br/>
friends had got a ride with an older guy, he had been drinking, and they <br/>
subsequently were in an accident.   In response to this tragedy, some parents started <br/>
a service called &quot;AnnaMac&quot;   ANother Night Alive, Make A Call... Taken from <br/>
her name, Anna McAslin.   (heres a link for the full story  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.catawba.k12.nc.us/news_info/annamacfull.htm">http://www.catawba.k12.nc.us/news_info/annamacfull.htm</a>   The short version is that parents are <br/>
offering a service for kids to call to get a ride home, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.. if <br/>
a kid needs a ride because they have been drinking or their ride has been <br/>
drinking.    OK, great idea.. I&#39;m not dissing thier efforts, anything to save a <br/>
kids life.. BUT, it was so strikingly crystal clear to our family what the real <br/>
problem is.. Kids are afraid to call thier parents!  They are afraid of the <br/>
consequences of drinking.   They have most likley been threatened with that &quot;If <br/>
I ever catch you, or Your better never....&quot; so, instead of calling home for a <br/>
ride, they would risk thier lives with a drunk driver or drinking and driving <br/>
themselves.  Landon knows, he has known since he was.. well, I can&#39;t remember <br/>
how young, certianly before he started going out with friends.. that he can ( <br/>
AND SHOULD!!) call me if he needs a ride.  I will be the one that offers &quot;No <br/>
questions asked&quot;   He has never called me for a ride. but he has told me &quot;so <br/>
and so had  beer, etc.. and I got a ride home with someone else&quot;   He knows I am <br/>
not going to lecture him about being friends with so and so, or throw <br/>
judgement on them.    My deepest sympathies go out to this family that lost thier <br/>
daughter, I know it&#39;s a tremendous heartbreak.. I can&#39;t help but think that the <br/>
guilt must be horrendous, knowing that thier daughter would be alive if she had <br/>
just called them for a ride.<br/>
