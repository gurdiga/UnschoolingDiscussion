&gt;  It&#39;s tricky unschooling an only child at times.  Does anyone else have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have 2 only children (they are 10 years apart!).  Oldest is on his own and <br/>
has a family of his own now.  #2 son is 12.  Unschooling is absolutely the <br/>
best when there is one child.  The one on one interaction makes so much <br/>
sense.  I love being around my son, so when he &#39;interrupts&#39; what I&#39;m doing <br/>
with questions of his own or a need he has, it doesn&#39;t offend me in the least <br/>
(not suggesting other parents are offended when their children interrupt <br/>
them!, just pointing out that it is sometimes easier to make the time for one <br/>
child.)<br/>
<br/>
In short, we are having a grand time!<br/>
