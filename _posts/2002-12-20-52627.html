&lt;&lt; Also the sucking mechanism for breastfeeding is so different from the <br/>
bottle <br/>
 and many dentists just lump the two together. If formula feeding at night <br/>
can <br/>
 lead to cavities then breastfeeling must also. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason bottle fed babies tend to develop cavities, is when the <br/>
parents leave them with the bottle and they fall asleep with it in their <br/>
mouth.<br/>
Course, there are other reason, like the sugars being more acidic in the <br/>
mouth than breastmilk and stuff. Babies that lay in their bed with a bottle <br/>
are at higher risk for ear infection, not only because of the formula, but <br/>
because of the way they lay (liquid can sit in the ear and promote <br/>
infection)...blah, blah, blah.<br/>
I&#39;m sure most of you already know this, but I just get going when I think of <br/>
all these poor little babies not getting snuggled when they eat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of my babies were breastfed, some bottlefed.  All were snuggled, <br/>
cuddled, and given lots of &quot;warmycozies&quot;  :-)   I never propped a bottle nor <br/>
gave them one to take to bed.    Breastfeeding IS the best choice for <br/>
babies.. but, I dont feel my children were neglected or harmed because I <br/>
didnt breastfeed all of them.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but the problems I outlined involved the ones that weren&#39;t being held! <br/>
That&#39;s what bothers me the most about bottle feeding....when the parents <br/>
don&#39;t hold them close and comfort during feeding.<br/>
There are parents that truly can&#39;t breastfeed (although rare) and babies that <br/>
are adopted, that&#39;s what formula is for.  But I hate to see them treated with <br/>
less nurture just because of the fact that the parents are using a bottle.<br/>
