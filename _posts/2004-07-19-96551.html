<div id="ygrps-yiv-808354753">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I think that my probation period is over, and it&#39;s time to say hi <br/>
:)  I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while and I have found it to be <br/>
one of the most refreshing elists I have ever seen.  This is the first <br/>
list that actually tackles tough issues, in a smart, straight forward, <br/>
and thoughtful way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m a mom of three kiddos - Cameron(6), Allison(3) and <br/>
Megan(8mo.) and we&#39;ve become relaxed homeschoolers kind of on accident. <br/>
  Something about having an infant....<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the thread on nail biting and was really curious about <br/>
the poster who said that her husband gets really angry when he&#39;s <br/>
interrupted....  I was thinking - &quot;How does she unschool, or even <br/>
homeschool of any kind, in this situation?&quot;  I&#39;m really curious about <br/>
that. :P<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the topic of emailing DH at work.  I don&#39;t know about <br/>
other DH&#39;s, but my DH at work = unfun.  He&#39;s all business and the last <br/>
thing I want is for him to think about personal and family issues while <br/>
at work.  Ack!  The morning, before work, is also a bad time for him. <br/>
The best time, I&#39;ve found, for hubby is during dinner, or after the <br/>
kids are in bed and we&#39;re playing our video games.  If I bring things <br/>
up at work, or when he&#39;s thinking about work - oh my, he&#39;s a big <br/>
grumparoo!  And, he goes into business mode, dealing with us like we&#39;re <br/>
his colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet everyone.  I look forward to continuing to read the <br/>
interesting topics here.<br/>
<br/>

Well, I try really hard not to interrupt him when he&#39;s speaking his mind.<br/>
It&#39;s not really related to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not that way with our daughter.<br/>
