 </span></blockquote>I have noticed that when you let the game make all the Zoombinis - it always<br/>
makes twins.<br/>
<br/>
And I think that if they all have something in common, it would make many of<br/>
the puzzles more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, good for her &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Really?  If they were all the very same, wouldn&#39;t all the puzzles be...  not <br/>
even puzzles?  <br/>

I&#39;m thinking of Master Mind if the row is all one color.  <br/>
<br/>
Depends how many guesses you can have, but if there are only four options on <br/>
any one bit, similarity seems it would be helpful.<br/>

Holly makes pairs and sets and she&#39;s the best at pattern games in our family. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll ask her and Marty if they ever thought of doing all same, or half and <br/>
half.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34131569">The way you solve them is by trying different combinations - the more  <br/>
different zoombinis you have, the more you can select just the  <br/>
combination you want to try next to get the info you need to solve the  <br/>
puzzle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Casey said that she makes twins so that when she gets one through, <br/>
she always gets the second through as a bonus. She keeps one <br/>
characteristic (say noses) the same on all so that she can easily get <br/>
though the puzzle on the raft. Like Sandra said, no puzzle at all on <br/>
that one.<br/>
