Oh, Amy honey.  GR?  I was born there, went to Calvin College (ick, <br/>
ptooie!), birthed my first baby in GR and got my wedding cakes at Arnies <br/>
(yes, in that order.)  You are SO surrounded by fundies - and Christian <br/>
Reformed Fundies at that!  A whole world unto themselves.  For goodness <br/>
sake, they have Jesus Billboards.  (laughing)  You&#39;ve met my <br/>
Family!!!  (maniacal laughing)<br/>
Oh, I&#39;m so very sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway there ARE some cool folks in GR, you just really have to go <br/>
searching for them.  My sister lives there, but her kids are only 1 and <br/>
3.  I&#39;m just starting to try and finagle her into considering <br/>
un/homeschooling.  She&#39;s SAH now.  (and yes, she&#39;s Xtian, but not <br/>
fundie!)  Not much help for you there.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We lived for a while in Ann Arbor and it&#39;s more an alternative-friendly <br/>
place.  Any chance you could move?<br/>

I love Jesus Billboards! Better yet I like the homemade ones on fences along <br/>
highways. I keep a collection. (Not the billboards themselves, just what they <br/>
say. &lt;g) Many around here are antiabortion or just ads to get you to go to <br/>
such and such church, but every now and then I find a keeper. Like the one seen <br/>
yesterday, traveling between Topeka, KS and Joplin, MO; each word on an <br/>
individual board, nailed to a fence post. (on a godforsaken road with speed limit <br/>
signs posted for 55 but you really didn&#39;t want to go more than 25, I was very <br/>
lost) Each board was about 100 feet from the next one and they read:<br/>
<br/>
HAVE<br/>
YOU <br/>
MET<br/>
JESUS?<br/>
NO?<br/>
YOU&#39;RE<br/>
GOING<br/>
TO <br/>
HELL!<br/>
<br/>
Would hate to meet that farmer on a blustery, rainy night, in need of help <br/>
changing a tire! <br/>

happy to help you change a tire, and might even bring you up to the <br/>
house for a cup of coffee if you needed to wait for a tow.  Sure, he <br/>
might offer to pray with you -- but I&#39;m always amazed at what nice <br/>
people most fundies are, especially when someone&#39;s in need.<br/>

not be allowed to come to church?  Or if he does to cage him in a play pen?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you mean the fundies who had a fit because a young unmarried<br/>
mother who desperately needed a job was hired to work in the church nursery?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you mean the fundies who had a fit because the handcarved cross<br/>
donated to the church looked to &quot;catholic&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you mean the fundies who refuse to let their kids play with my<br/>
kids because we read Harry Potter?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you mean the fundie woman who pushed my 10yo son because she<br/>
thought he was disobeying her when he was only trying to keep his very young<br/>
brother from doing something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you mean the fundie who screamed and yelled at me on the<br/>
telephone for allowing the teens to make their own decisions about age<br/>
limits on the cast of their play?<br/>
<br/>
Or......<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you and your children were hurt, and I was not defending <br/>
people who are hurtful and mean.  I meant the fundies I grew up <br/>
surrounded by, who were faced with a liberal hippie family moving <br/>
into their small town and who, overall, tried to make us welcome in <br/>
the ways they knew (by inviting us to church, of course &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
I believe my wording was that I was &quot;amazed&quot; and I really did not <br/>
mean that in an underhanded &quot;I&#39;m going to show you where you were <br/>
wrong&quot; way. I really am amazed.  People who helped me with flat <br/>
tires, who would watch us kids at a moment&#39;s notice when my parents <br/>
needed it, who would help find our lost pony, who would lend us the <br/>
use of their tractor, who taught my brother and I how to ride horses, <br/>
who would offer us orange juice and cookies and let us look at a <br/>
lifetime&#39;s worth of knick-knacks collected in their house . . . and <br/>
then could turn around and, in our earshot, talk about hell and <br/>
African-Americans (though that&#39;s not the word they used) and &quot;women&#39;s <br/>
libbers&quot; (of which my mother was one) and whatever else.  <br/>
<br/>
I was the one who started this thread by saying I didn&#39;t want to join <br/>
a homeschooling group of fundamentalists -- no matter what my past <br/>
neighbors taught me, I don&#39;t want my kids to have to deal with that, <br/>
and I don&#39;t want to deal with it.  My in-laws are close enough (not <br/>
fundie, but not terribly open, either).<br/>
<br/>
But if I were driving down a country road and my car broke down, I <br/>
would probably feel okay in knocking on the nearest farmhouse door <br/>
and asking for help, even if there were Jesusy signs all over the <br/>
place.  Let them play the Good Samaritan, y&#39;know? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clarifies -- and I hope you&#39;ve found other people to hang <br/>
with?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy</div>
