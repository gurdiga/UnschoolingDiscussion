<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023327478"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;First, do you remember what it was about horses?  This kind of surprised<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me. I thought it was grime and dirt in general.  I don&#39;t immunize my<br/>
children but I DO live in an area with horses freely roaming the streets. &lt;&lt;<br/>

This is from a tetanus info site:<br/>
Tetanus, also sometimes called &quot;lockjaw&quot;, is caused by a toxin produced by a<br/>
bacteria called Clostridium tetani. C. tetani is found all over, including<br/>
soil (the garden and field kind), stool and manure, and anything lying on<br/>
the ground. Rusty metal is also a favourite place for C. tetani to hang out,<br/>
and in fact puncture wounds with rusty nails are a common cause of tetanus.<br/>
C. tetani grows in wounds, especially closed wounds like punctures, and<br/>
produces a toxin that paralyzes muscles -- thus the term &quot;lockjaw&quot;. In the<br/>
worst case tetanus can kill by paralyzing the breathing muscles. Although C.<br/>
tetani itself can be treated easily with penicillin, antibiotics will not<br/>
destroy or neutralize the toxin. Antibodies to the toxin can bind to and<br/>
inactivate the toxin before it attacks muscles and nerves<br/>
<br/>
As far as the vaccines derived from human cell lines, this explains it as<br/>
well as I&#39;ve seen it anywhere: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm">http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm</a></div>
