 </span></blockquote>Extremes aren&#39;t helpful.   To say you can&#39;t afford to make a change and that <br/>
you&#39;re buying crap will make it difficult for you to see how gradual changes <br/>
work, and how living by principles works.<br/>
<br/>
To define food as crap is in the same category as callng someone stupid.   It <br/>
doesn&#39;t help anything.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not &quot;crap&quot; on one end and the perfect-yet-unaffordable food on the <br/>
other, with a choice between the two.    Every time you shop you have a choice, <br/>
and you can make the better choice of the things you can afford.   Each time <br/>
you decide how to prepare something, you have choices.   If you don&#39;t want to <br/>
choose among a hundred or a dozen, give yourself two choices:   omelette or <br/>
scrambled?   Butter or spray?   (not a good example for vegans; fine for <br/>
vegetarians).    But you could look at those two choices and realize you&#39;d really <br/>
rather have boiled eggs and bypass all the oil and need of cheese.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I guess I could cook from scratch more.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Guessing or knowing? &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m being picky about words, but it&#39;s not &quot;just semantics.&quot;   It&#39;s <br/>
about seeing the world in a bright and hopeful way and not being defeatist or <br/>
limiting ourselves by feeling powerless and poor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(I bake like Betty Crocker though.<br/>
Cookies anyone?)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m way better at baking than at doing meat and vegetables.    <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an idea that will work with just about ever aspect of life:<br/>
Every time you make a decision, wait until you&#39;ve thought of two choices and <br/>
choose the better one.   It seems simple, but I was surprised when I thought <br/>
of that way to ratchet the quality of life up to find how many times I was <br/>
acting without really thinking.    <br/>
<br/>
It first came up when a friend who was being knighted was saying that he felt <br/>
bad that he didn&#39;t have good a good period-looking camp, and he couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford one, so   he had to look shabby all the time.      I   said if you always <br/>
make the better choice, gradually your equipment will get better.   If you can <br/>
only afford a nylon tent, get a brown one instead of a blue one.   If you&#39;re <br/>
buying used dishes, choose what looks older.     <br/>
<br/>
Having that idea almost 20 years ago changed my own life.   Kirby was a baby, <br/>
and I used that method on my own life, not just on improving my camp (which <br/>
was already better than other aspects of my life), and I still do.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t choose between crap and unaffordable.   Pick two good things that ARE <br/>
in your range of possibility and choose the best of those.   The next time you <br/>
choose, your two choices might be better than last time because you&#39;ll know <br/>
more, have better ideas, be unsatisfied to consider anymore that lesser of the <br/>
two from the last time.<br/>

   <br/>
  Thank you for sharing this.  I don&#39;t know where I picked up this &#39;all or nothing&#39; type thinking, but what you just wrote should be so simple and obvious, except for many people it&#39;s not.<br/>
  This will help me with my kids.  When they have an interest or want certain supplies, I don&#39;t always have the money at the time.  But I always have some money and can get them some of it now instead of waiting until I can buy everything.<br/>
  One of my kids has been wanting to redecorate her bedroom.  I&#39;m thinking I can&#39;t do new furniture right now, but I can buy paint, fabrics, stencils, posters and many other things that would allow her to do much of what she wants.  The rest can come later.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for the post,<br/>
  Ann<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739540086">I had many years of this. Kate was vegetarian for quite a while. We tend to<br/>
eat a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes anyway, so that helped.<br/>
<br/>
I usually try to make meals that can be put together since we have quite a<br/>
variety of tastes here anyway.  I just bought vegetarian alternatives to add<br/>
to the mix. So when I make spaghetti, I have noodles, sauce, cheese and<br/>
meatballs all separate and people combine whatever they want. I just add<br/>
veggie meatballs as an option. For things like chili, I don&#39;t put meat in<br/>
sometimes anyway (the beans provide plenty of protein). If I&#39;m in the mood<br/>
for meat, I just put some in another pot without meat or with a meat<br/>
alternative. It dirties an extra pot, but it&#39;s not any extra work. Chicken<br/>
patties, hotdogs, hamburgers all have veggie alternatives of course. Tacos<br/>
are easy to do this with.  If I&#39;m doing a meal like roast chicken or beef,<br/>
then I just make sure there are quick and easy veggie &quot;meats&quot; available to<br/>
heat up. Kate would do that herself.  I would make sure to do some<br/>
vegetarian meals as well since we like that anyway.  As long as I have the<br/>
alternatives handy, it wasn&#39;t&#39; much extra work. It is pricier though.  <br/>

&gt;have a choice, <br/>
&gt; and you can make the better choice of the things you can afford.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. For example, we love flour tortillas. Making whole wheat <br/>
ones at home was something DH used to do but now we don&#39;t often <br/>
find/make the time for that process. There are several &#39;white bread&#39; <br/>
equivalent types that often are on sale (buy 1 get 1 etc) - cheap. <br/>
However, they have tons of sodium (as well as other stuff). With a <br/>
little looking around at the grocery store (major chain place, not a <br/>
small, local or specialty place) I found, clear across in the deli <br/>
section, some really good, half the sodium, whole wheat tortillas <br/>
that cost about the same as the other, except they are rarely on <br/>
special. So I choose the &#39;better&#39; choice - not perfect but better. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, though, one thing we did was to go &#39;totally plant&#39; for <br/>
about 2 weeks (one big and one small grocery trip) - no regular <br/>
cheese, no animal milk, no meats, etc (hmm okay maybe some margarine <br/>
got in there, I&#39;m not sure if it did or not). Yes, that was a bit <br/>
more expensive than our usual shopping trips. Then, we added back in <br/>
bit by bit those things that we really wanted to add back in and <br/>
kept the organic, vegetarian, etc stuff that we liked as well. The <br/>
*process* was important. Instead of saying &quot;this is what we usually <br/>
get, this is what we can afford&quot; we looked (and continue to look) <br/>
further afield and check out alternatives to the &#39;same old, same <br/>
old&#39;. We weren&#39;t all that big on prepared, packaged foods anyhow for <br/>
the most part, now we just look a little more closely at what we get <br/>
and think more consciously about what we are wanting and how to <br/>
arrive at that end in different ways. Some stuff is organic, some <br/>
stuff is veg, some is lower in sodium or higher in this or that <br/>
nutrient/vitamin/mineral/whatever. It&#39;s more a conscious choice when <br/>
I pick out this particular pasta sauce - it may be because it&#39;s <br/>
organic or because it&#39;s low sodium or it may simply be that it is <br/>
the one we like best. As with everything else, it&#39;s a balance - <br/>
sometimes we have to choose between item a which is a vegan organic <br/>
product and item b which is not and costs half as much which would <br/>
allow space in the budget for item c which we want to get but is not <br/>
critical.<br/>

<br/>
So true! I once spent over $200 on groceries (after going to 2 different<br/>
places to find everything we needed) at a large health food store when my dd<br/>
started complaining of stomach-aches all the time. My family (DH mostly)<br/>
complained about most of the stuff and wanted their old stuff back. Maybe a<br/>
more gradual change would work better. See what we like and what we don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I would love for my family to eat organic, but it is expensive where we<br/>
live. Meat, vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk, butter; all of these things are<br/>
at least twice as much as the regular stuff. Since these are things we eat<br/>
all the time they concern me the most. I haven&#39;t seen any other choices in<br/>
our grocery store and I am seriously concerned about additives and<br/>
preservatives, pesticides and hormones in our food.  <br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

I just use locally made cheap flour tortillas, and I might worry about it <br/>
more if I didn&#39;t have to wait for the 80 year old ladies to get out of the way <br/>
before I could get to them.    They seem happy, and aren&#39;t spending large chunks <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406722283">This was the advice I was going to give.  If you can join an organic produce coop, they&#39;re often alot less expensive than a WholeFoods, for example. The only drawback is that you often get a strange assortment of things that are in season at that time (can be fun figuring out what to make!).  I would post the website where you can find local farms but can&#39;t seem to put my hands on it a the moment (CSA something or other?).<br/>
<br/>
And to respond to Kelly--  we tend to make large batches of vegetarian stews and soups (especially in the winter) and freeze several multi-portion containers (check recipes to see what frezes well--lentil soup does not freeze well IMO).  You could make something veggie and rich in bean proteins, for example, and then on a meat night Cameron could defrost something of his choice from the freezer.<br/>

  Maybe the answer is not to eat them all the time.   If the eggs you want are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390166064">Hi<br/>
   there used to be a book published in the UK called A Vegetarian <br/>
in the Family that looked at creative ways of making one meal that <br/>
with additions or subtractions would suit everyone. Dunno if it&#39;s <br/>
published anymore but worth looking for.<br/>
<br/>
You could do things like make a basic tomato sauce for pasta, divide <br/>
in to two portions, add already cooked meat to yours and already <br/>
beans,lentils, soya mince or tofu to his. Then you on;y have to cook <br/>
the spaghetti. You could make a few veggie loaves in one go and <br/>
freeze in easy portions. Then you could make up a whole dinner and <br/>
you have the meat and he can have his loaf. Same with burgers, batch <br/>
cook and freeze then it&#39;s only the fixings and buns to do.<br/>
<br/>
Make a whole basic tomato pizza, cut in half/quarters or whatever <br/>
before it goes in the oven and add meat to your portions and extra <br/>
cheese or mushrooms or something to his.<br/>

involved in, or know of, a local co-op for buying organic fruits and<br/>
vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
We buy our beef, pork, chicken, and eggs from local farmers.  The animals<br/>
are grass-fed and not given antibiotics or hormones.  We found them through<br/>
the Eat Wild website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eatwild.com">http://www.eatwild.com</a>   We found the cattle farmer<br/>
first and he then directed us to the pig farmer and the chicken farmer.<br/>
It&#39;s relatively easy to make connections in the organic farming community<br/>
once you figure out where to begin, and Eat Wild is a good place to begin.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to buy only organic to reduce or avoid additives, <br/>
preservatives, pesticides, and hormones.<br/>
<br/>
If you cook from scratch, you can easily reduce additives and <br/>
preservatives. Even frozen vegetables don&#39;t have the additive load <br/>
that canned do (or prepared meals).<br/>
<br/>
To reduce pesticides, do some Google research on the crops that are <br/>
most heavily sprayed and consider reducing those. When organic <br/>
produce isn&#39;t an option, wash the produce you do buy with soap (not <br/>
antibacterial, unless you want to trade triclosan for the <br/>
pesticides). Peel things.<br/>
<br/>
To reduce hormones, eat *less* meat/milk, and/or replace *some* <br/>
meat/milk with organic varieties. Maybe replace some milk with <br/>
soy/almond/rice milk. <br/>
<br/>
Not eating meat, or eating less meat, is cheap; you don&#39;t have to <br/>
get soy versions of everything as replacements. Poor people the <br/>
world around eat little or no meat. If you aren&#39;t familiar with <br/>
vegetarian meal options beyond salad or spaghetti, plan meals around <br/>
complementary proteins, like a grain and a legume: rice/beans, <br/>
cornbread/beans, tortillas/beans, pasta/chickpeas, pita <br/>
bread/hummus, rice/lentils, barley/beans... Consider less-<br/>
expensive &quot;meat replacements&quot;, like TVP (texturized vegetable <br/>
protein), which can be rehydrated with beef stock (obviously not <br/>
vegetarian, but a less-meat option) and taco seasoning to make a <br/>
fine taco/burrito filling.<br/>
<br/>
Other options to get organic produce and meats less expensively are <br/>
gardening, Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs), farmers markets, <br/>
and you-pick farms (though some can be just as expensive as the <br/>
store). Check www.pickyourown.org or www.localharvest.org for CSAs <br/>
and you-picks near you. Craigslist sometimes has listings for farms, <br/>
too (www.craigslist.org). I realize it isn&#39;t the best time of year <br/>
for these in most of the country, but file the idea away for spring, <br/>
maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419993914">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   One of my kids has been wanting to redecorate her bedroom.  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking I can&#39;t do new furniture right now, but I can buy paint, fabrics,<br/>
stencils, posters and many other things that would allow her to do much of<br/>
what she wants.  The rest can come later. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
New furniture is the last thing to change - you haven&#39;t been watching enough<br/>
BBC America - try &quot;House Invaders&quot; - the mandate is to use only leftovers<br/>
that the homeowner already has and a the few little bits and pieces that the<br/>
designer has in her (usually her) kit. Its amazing what they accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
Paint is cheap. Go to your large home supply or paint chain store and ask<br/>
about mistints - mistakes that the sales associate made that sell for half<br/>
price. You can mix any water based paints together regardless of finish.<br/>
Save oil based for trim or small furniture pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Fabric is not cheap a lot of the time - especially if you are looking at<br/>
furnishing fabrics. Dye is cheap. You can get dress fabrics on sale and dye<br/>
them if necessary. It is also a way to bring a range of remnants into the<br/>
same tonal range.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as someone who had to do a lot of temporary redecorating in the<br/>
film business, don&#39;t forget Contact paper. You can make a wooden<br/>
table/dresser top look like marble. The trick is to cut (with a Stanley<br/>
knife) a random wavy line at the overlap point of sections, rather than try<br/>
and line up the straight edges.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am. What I do is take out meat for dh--kids can take it or leave <br/>
it, depending upon what it is, marinate it and have it ready for him to <br/>
grill. I then make my meal *around* the meat so that the meat is a side <br/>
dish or a topping. For instance, some kind of fabulous salad or pasta <br/>
salad with bread, olive oil and hard cheese, makes a delicious, protein <br/>
rich meal for me, which dh can easily top with chicken or salmon. Or, I <br/>
make a really great quinoa or risotto or some other substantial grain <br/>
that I can top with a bean salsa of some sort, maybe bake an acorn <br/>
squash and stuff that, something along those lines, with which a grilled <br/>
chicken breast goes nicely. Or, I make mashed/ baked/ cubed/ hashed <br/>
potatoes with eggs for me and some kind of meat for others. Or, I can <br/>
make pannini sandwiches with chicken or mozzarella, roasted reds, baby <br/>
spinach and tomatoes.<br/>
<br/>
The key is to view the meat as the side dish rather than the main <br/>
dish--difficult for mainstream America, I think. ;) It helps to be <br/>
lacto-ovo, of course. I do cheese and/or nuts in almost everything <br/>
dinner related. I thought I&#39;d have a really hard time going veg, because <br/>
I envisioned having to learn to like eggplant and mushrooms (ewww!), but <br/>
it really hasn&#39;t been difficult at all. I just kept all the flavors I <br/>
liked before and dropped out the meat.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there are some nights where we do simply make different meals <br/>
because we&#39;re all feeling like different things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630923995">I wanted to chime in here - I try and buy organic and natural food as much<br/>
as possible - and it is true most organic food costs more than regular<br/>
grocery store name brand stuff. However, I have done several things to be<br/>
able to afford to do this.<br/>
<br/>
I found a local natural food store with a great bulk food section. Buying<br/>
things this way is much cheaper than even the store brand in some cases. You<br/>
have to serve yourself - and there aren&#39;t shopping bags and other things<br/>
that would cause overhead at this store. You can also look for a natural<br/>
food co-op in your area where you share bulk buying with other members. This<br/>
brings the cost down as well.<br/>
<br/>
I also joined a CSA farm ( Consumer Supported Agriculture) and I worked 70<br/>
hours throughout the season in exchange for the share of organic fresh<br/>
veggies and herbs each week. this was great for me and myr kids as they went<br/>
along and helped some weeks, played or found all kinds of interesting bugs<br/>
and snakes ( We even saw a hummingbird on its nest!)<br/>
<br/>
I go to local farmers markets and (lucky for me I am in Amish country!) can<br/>
find great meats that are local and fresh and have many are grass-fed and<br/>
groan without hormones, yogurt, cheese, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is another local homeschool mom that has a farm where we get our milk,<br/>
eggs and some chicken, turkey & I bought a 1/8 of a cow cut up and packaged<br/>
and delivered to my freezer.<br/>
<br/>
I think what was said about the little steps are important. It&#39;s not all or<br/>
nothing. We actually ate at McDonalds today because we met friends and<br/>
exchanged kids. I make better choices at McDonalds than before....Salad and<br/>
parfait are not bad - but the kids usually like nuggets, fries and soda -<br/>
and I don&#39;t think it is horrible because on average we eat pretty healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I may not always have the money to go to the natural food store, although I<br/>
find that I will then choose the items of most importance to buy organic. I<br/>
usually eat less meat that week - and buy some organic, I cook a lot form<br/>
scratch - and tonight even we had scrambled eggs and buckwheat pancakes with<br/>
local maple syrup. I don&#39;t buy a lot of cookies and cakes and stuff, but<br/>
tend to bake with the kids. We have a vita mix and I make homemade ice cream<br/>
and smoothies often.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t all happen overnight....but one thing led to another and it is<br/>
do-able.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some sources that will help you find local stuff in your area.<br/>

&gt; live. Meat, vegetables, fruit, eggs, milk, butter; all of these things are<br/>
&gt; at least twice as much as the regular stuff. Since these are things we eat<br/>
&gt; all the time they concern me the most. I haven&#39;t seen any other choices in<br/>
&gt; our grocery store and I am seriously concerned about additives and<br/>
&gt; preservatives, pesticides and hormones in our food.<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; Thanks, Aubrey<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132881312">My husband and my interest is in growing/hunting/providing our own <br/>
food, more from a self-sustaining kind of a life philosophy than from <br/>
any kind of a health perspective.  But of course, we expect that will <br/>
come too, as we would be avoiding the chemical fertilizers and <br/>
pesticides and such.  Of course, at the moment we&#39;re not in a <br/>
position to even make grocery choices (we live with his parents and <br/>
don&#39;t have money to stock a second fridge), so it&#39;s nice to dream.  <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Providing your own food can be much more expensive in the short run <br/>
(buying the land, etc.), but probably is about the same or less <br/>
expensive in the long run, and you have the ultimate quality control <br/>
built in.  Maybe even city dwellers have space to grow a few beans or <br/>
something that might be too expensive at the local health food store.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859575603">Speaking as someone who had to do a lot of temporary redecorating in <br/>
the<br/>
film business, don&#39;t forget Contact paper. You can make a wooden<br/>
table/dresser top look like marble. The trick is to cut (with a Stanley<br/>
knife) a random wavy line at the overlap point of sections, rather than <br/>
try<br/>
and line up the straight edges.<br/>
________<br/>
   <br/>
  Robyn,<br/>
   <br/>
  This is a great suggestion!  She has a dresser that has a veneer type finish that doesn&#39;t hold paint or stain well, but contact paper would be neat!  She is wanting to paint several small murals on her wall with the neon type paint that glows with black lights, so the whole look is very casual.  She will be 13 in January and I think she is just wanting to transform her little girls&#39; room into something she feels is more grown up.  She loves to paint and draw so, she sees those walls as a huge canvas to be enjoyed.  If I had not found unschooling, I&#39; m not sure I would have ever just handed her the supplies and asked how I could help.  <br/>
  I do enjoy this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992212526">Well, I drop anywhere form $100-200 a week, depending on how much we entertain or if there is a holiday that we buy extra stuff for.  I don&#39;t buy anything organic, nobody here is a vegetarian and well, we all eat what we want, no food rules at all.  I only say this for those of you who do buy organic and such, I don&#39;t think you are probably spending that much extra.  You probably aren&#39;t spending money on the ice cream, oreo cookies, spaghettios etc... that we buy all the time because we like it.  We also eat a lot of fruits and veggies (none organic, but I do love to garden), but will do a cheeseburger with fires some nights too.  I really think that with some creativity most people can eat the sort of diet they want within most budgets.  I admire all of your discipline and dedication to eating healthy.  I&#39;m not inspired enough to change anything:0)  I suppose the vision of my 80+ yr old granparents who regurlay ate eggs and bacon for breakfast has left me with little motivation.<br/>

<br/>
Me too. One big shop per week between $175 - 200, and then a smaller shop of<br/>
close to $80 half way through the week when we run out of milk, eggs and<br/>
bread and other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rent, cars, health insurance, then groceries over here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551290528">Wow!  That&#39;s quite a bit!  I complain when I spend more than $80 a week :).<br/>
Maybe demographics have more to do with it than actually the food itself.  I<br/>
know that before the hurricanes hit, we could get large oranges and<br/>
grapefruits for 4 for a buck, sometimes 5 for a buck.  This year we can&#39;t<br/>
touch them for well over a buck each.  Chicken makes up most of our meals,<br/>
with frozen veggies and a side it makes a cheap meal.  We don&#39;t splurge on<br/>
cookies, ice cream, ect. nor do we eat out.  And do I get strange looks when<br/>
I say that!  LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939722984">Oh see, I was just making the assumption that if one bought organic foods then they may also tend to avoid some of the more &#39;processed, higher sugar&#39; type foods.  I didn&#39;t even know there was organic ice cream, well except for perhaps the homemade kind. So i learned something new today.<br/>
   My point was that some thought they may spend more because they buy organic, we don&#39;t buy anything organic and we still spend a lot.  We just spend it on convenience stuff, sweets, chips etc...  We also buy foods that most would consider healthy, we just don&#39;t make much distinction between the two on a daily basis.  By the end of the week, we&#39;re out of food both the healthy and the not so much, so all things get eaten. Of course I am also feeding four older kids ages 11 and up, and they can eat a lot of food.<br/>
