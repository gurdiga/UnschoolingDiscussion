&lt;&lt; lso, have you tried stevia?  A friend on another list uses it and has no<br/>
 reactions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Yes, I have tried stevia, but don&#39;t like the bitter after taste.  Also, I <br/>
have called a few places looking for organic berries, but no luck, so far.  I <br/>
will call the co-op tomorrow to see if they can help.  Thanks.  ~Karen</div>
