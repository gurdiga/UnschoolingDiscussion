See what happens when you go there?<br/>
I remember that thread all too well, and am now embarassed at my limited <br/>
thinking!!<br/>
The road to unschooling has not been easy, but it has been a time of huge <br/>
growth.<br/>
And for the record, after lifting any restrictions about a year ago, and <br/>
adding cable to our lives in March, my oldest is finally starting to show <br/>
signs of being interested in other things when at home.<br/>
He has spent most of his day playing outside, setting up dates with his <br/>
friends and begging me to go somewhere fun, mainly watches at night.<br/>
I kept having fits of doubt and everyone calmly told me to keep trusting.<br/>
I have to admit, I thought they just didn&#39;t know my son, but I trusted, I did <br/>
some deep breathing, I examined my own issues and VOILA! Here we are, with <br/>
children that use tv as one tool in their life.<br/>
Some days more than others.<br/>
I&#39;m glad you found the archives useful.<br/>

It&#39;s funny, I remember the day I met Ren,  she didn&#39;t have tv, video <br/>
games etc. I thought, oh no, another family my kids will have nothing <br/>
in common with.  She was very open minded though and when her kids <br/>
would come to my house they would play games and watch tv forever.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t take her long and Trevor got an N64.  Next came cable. She <br/>
called me and said that they were watching tv all day. I had to <br/>
laugh,  she trusted them though and let it go.  Now look where she&#39;s <br/>
at. She wants to let the whole world know about this unschooling <br/>
stuff. <br/>
What a bit of encouragement and a support list like this one can do.<br/>

Yeah, and now look at us!! <br/>
It&#39;s been very interesting watching these unschooled kids in comparison to <br/>
the school at home types. I think they never fight! If they disagree on <br/>
something, they just talk, it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
I&#39;ve so enjoyed seeing their interactions and how different it is from other <br/>
children their ages.  Thank goodness there is one other true unschooling <br/>
family here!!<br/>

but people here in Virginia are more sensitive than back home and <br/>
they get mortified. One women even cut all ties with me cos R said <br/>
&#39;bastard&#39; and her four year old repeated it. She was meant to be a <br/>
good friend :-(<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to R about it but when his temper goes to Defcon1 <br/>
there&#39;s no reasoning with him. This is why I have to leave <br/>
N.Virginia. Its too Stepford for us foul mouthed Brits :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope your wee bairn is feeling better soon<br/>

<br/>
My 12 yo son and I will start homeschooling [unschooling?  deschooling?]<br/>
right after Thanksgiving.  What should I do or provide for him during the<br/>
time he needs to &quot;decompress&quot; from the school experience - which was, by the<br/>
way, ADDawful?  How long is this &quot;deschooling&quot; period (how do we know when<br/>
it&#39;s over?)  And I especially want to understand what you all think about TV<br/>
and Nintendo.  I think he definitely would do this all day if left to his<br/>
own choices.<br/>

I think you should not make him go anymore.  Why go between now and <br/>
Thanksgiving?  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll need another extra month of decompression to get over that.<br/>
<br/>

I would tell you how many others have said that before you and then come back <br/>
and said &quot;Oh!  I was so wrong!  Thanks!&quot;  But I lost count years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something on video games.  Lots on video games and homeschooling:<br/>
<br/>

I hope someone will give you a link to some of the TV discussions at <br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
and I hope you and your son have TONS of fun together, getting over what&#39;s <br/>
already been done.  I used to teach 7th grade.  I know those boys don&#39;t need <br/>
that.<br/>
