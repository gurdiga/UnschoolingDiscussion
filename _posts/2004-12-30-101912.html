<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265895661">My kids suggest musical chairs with StrongBad singing.  A StrongBad <br/>
pinata.  A Pom-Pom cake.  Fluffy Puff marshmallows.  Pin the Tail on <br/>
StrongSad.  A game based on the &quot;thing in the bag&quot; episode--put some <br/>
random stuff in a paperbag and have people reach in and feel them <br/>
and guess what they are.<br/>

Happy Birthday to Rowan from Corrina and David!!</div>
