<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851715790">As I said before, I&#39;ve returned home from a week away to find 37 <br/>
digests for this group in my inbox.  Now, while I&#39;m glad to see that <br/>
this list is &#39;thriving,&#39; (now where did I put that &#39;the life-cycle of an e-<br/>
list&#39; message???) I just want to point out that for anyone on digest <br/>
it&#39;s a HUGE PITA to have posts repeated in folks replies.  I <br/>
particularly got bored of seeing the unschooling-dotcom egroup sig <br/>
file up to 5 times on certain messages.  I personally find it useful to <br/>
include the relevant part(s) of the message I&#39;m replying to, but <br/>
PLEASE use that ol&#39; pair of scissors when replying with the original <br/>
message included.  Also, since the time-frame (and potential <br/>
volume of email) can be very variable from original to reply, it does <br/>
help to follow the thread if the relevant part is included.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, folks, spare a thought for those on digest!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966413980">I finally - after 4 months - got  a used computer - Dell 266. I bought<br/>
my two sons Oregon Trail and they have been playing it for two days<br/>
straight. My 14 year old son has dyslexia and wasn&#39;t reading much -<br/>
tired of being forced to read meaningless words, etc. at public school.<br/>
I was concerned that he would get bored or frustrated quickly because<br/>
the game has a lot of reading to it. He really loves it. I am happy for<br/>
him. I have been watching the two boys as their interest and surprise<br/>
grows that they can go about their learning naturally. My 14 year old<br/>
has yelled at me a couple of times saying, &quot;You&#39;re the teacher tell me<br/>
what to do!&quot; He is &quot;in transition&quot;:) as I am. Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056808395">I think marijuana should be made legal for pain relief. I recall my<br/>
greatgrandmother purchasing some green powder from the local drugstore<br/>
back in the 60&#39;s and burning it. She was dying of pnemonia at the time,<br/>
I believe. I am not sure but I think it was pot or something of that<br/>
nature. <br/>
I have 6 kids and the older ones have all tried marijuana, alcohol and<br/>
cigerettes. My husband and I have tried it all too when we were teens.<br/>
What I try to get across to my kids is that it isn&#39;t only the drugs,<br/>
alcohol, etc. it is the people that come with these experiences. The<br/>
fist fights, the sex for drugs that ends up in an unwanted pregnancy,<br/>
the diseases, the guilt, shame, anger, defeat, etc. The negativity.<br/>
People who feel worthy, loved, care-free, fulfilled usually are able to<br/>
let go of the idea quicker that some outside &quot;thing&quot; will MAKE them<br/>
happy, friends, quick money, etc. We live in a small town - about 10,000<br/>
- in rural Vermont. Almost every teen male we know sells drugs to make<br/>
easy money. Last week one of the teens that came to live with us<br/>
(daughters friend since childhood) from Florida got drunk and fell/was<br/>
thrown off a deck and broke her wrist so badly that she has 4-5 screws<br/>
in it and a cast up to her shoulder. The other teen who came to live<br/>
with us who really likes drugs and alcohol but was not using went home<br/>
to visit her parents and slit her wrist, needing 4-5 stitches. Her<br/>
adoptive mother keeps telling her she is unwanted, besides other issues.<br/>
Our family is in an unheavel at this time. My oldest daughter thinks we<br/>
are all nuts and doesn&#39;t want to talk to any of us. I called my oldest<br/>
son to talk to him. He lives with his girlfriend and her alcoholic<br/>
father. The father answered the phone by saying &quot;everyone is dead.&quot; I<br/>
hung up because if I didn&#39;t I would have told him what I thought of him<br/>
and I didn&#39;t want to cause my son any grief. That son smoked 4 joints a<br/>
few years ago with a few friends and it triggered a psychotic break<br/>
down. He hasn&#39;t been the same since. I mean that. He is a wonderful,<br/>
sensitive, caring young man who has been deeply injured. He works at a<br/>
liquor store and sees a great majority of adults from our town buying<br/>
liquor Monday - Sunday. Some buy it in the little bottles so they can<br/>
sneak it to work, while driving, etc. They say it is their &quot;happy<br/>
juice.&quot; This is their life. Day in and day out. Trying to hide and<br/>
self-medicate. It is supposed to be a secret. Yet, the secret is out. We<br/>
all have choices to make no matter what happens to us or doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
for us in life. Looking back I did the best I knew how. I do the best I<br/>
can at this time, too. What I see for the kids who are using is that<br/>
there is a lack of communication, forgiveness, unconditional love,<br/>
talking, action, etc. in their lives with their parents. It is difficult<br/>
and painful at times to come face to face with our own shortcomings, our<br/>
own embarrassments, our shame, guilt, etc. When we have teens/kids they<br/>
have a way of triggering things in us. They push our buttons, push us to<br/>
the edge, push us away (and still have a need for us), etc. My kids know<br/>
I used and what experiences I had. They know some of my friends are dead<br/>
because they stayed on the negative path. Even with telling my kids and<br/>
other teens this, they will still make their own decisions. We can guide<br/>
and share - we do not own anyone. Today I may be saying goodbye to a<br/>
daughter. This is normal. It has been this way generation after<br/>
generation. Kids grow up and seperate from us. I am letting go. It hurts<br/>
and there is joy. I know I gave her all I had to give. It is up to her<br/>
now. Michele<br/>
