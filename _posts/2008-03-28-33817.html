<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136501474">My daughter(8) asked me why I have a calculator in my purse.  I told <br/>
her that I like to take it with me when I go shopping in case I need to <br/>
figure out the price of something that has a percent off.  I tried to <br/>
explain to her that sometimes, stores will have something that is on <br/>
sale and there will be a sign that says, &quot;Take an extra ___% off.&quot;  I <br/>
told her I like to know what the new price will be before I buy it. <br/>
<br/>
She asked what a percent was.  I tried to explain but unfortunately, I <br/>
didn&#39;t do a good job of it.  Any ideas of how to explain percents to an <br/>
8 year old?<br/>

how many out of each hundred<br/>

That&#39;s how I think of it.   Linguistically.  per (by) cent (hundred)<br/>
<br/>
cent, century, centenarian, centurian, centennial, centigrade,  <br/>
centimeter, percent, have to do with 100.<br/>
<br/>
She probably knows the phrase &quot;a hundred percent,&quot; so if that&#39;s 100  <br/>
out of 100, then 50% is 50 out of 100, etc.<br/>

make a whole or 100% - it ties well with dollars and pennies.  At the<br/>
dollar store, 6% sales tax adds 6 more pieces (or pennies) to every<br/>
item.  Or a 15% off sale takes away 15 pennies from every dollar. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826504151">Thanks for the info.  I did not know that percent meant &quot;by <br/>
hundred.&quot;  I also never really thought about the words century, <br/>
centennial, etc.  That would actually be a very good thing for me to <br/>

Once you start playing with etymology, you might find you can figure  <br/>
out lots of things by looking at the words themselves.<br/>

Before  you go there, though, see what you can figure out yourself  <br/>
about what the names of the days of the week and the months mean.  If  <br/>
you know more than one European language,that might help.  (Basque,  <br/>
Welsh or whatever Lapplanders speak won&#39;t help.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677989069">I had a book called &quot;English from the Roots Up&quot; - which is supposed to  <br/>
be used to do lessons on Latin and Greek roots of English words. But  <br/>
we played a game with it that was really fun and went on for many years.<br/>
<br/>
I put a little magnetic white board on our refrigerator. I kept the  <br/>
English from the Roots Up book on top of the fridge.<br/>
I&#39;d write one of the roots on the white board. Like &quot;chronos.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then anyone passing by would, if they felt like it, write a word that  <br/>
sounded like it was based on that root. Some of the words - chronic,  <br/>
chronicle, synchronous.<br/>
<br/>
After there were a bunch of words written there, or after a few days  <br/>
or a week - whenever I next felt like it - I&#39;d take down the book and  <br/>
copy all the other words that the book listed that we hadn&#39;t thought  <br/>
of and I&#39;d write what the book said was the meaning. I&#39;d leave that  <br/>
there for a few days or so and then erase it and start over.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while there would happen to be a little meet-up in the  <br/>
kitchen when more than one person would be thinking about it at the  <br/>
same time and a discussion would ensue. A few times the words were  <br/>
brought up in the car and talked about.<br/>
<br/>
For years this just sort of mostly went on in the background. At some  <br/>
time or another, my husband and all three kids participated and so did  <br/>
friends who happened to be in the kitchen and see it.<br/>
<br/>
It was a game and fun and sometimes weeks and weeks (months) went by  <br/>
and nobody played, but other times it would fill up fast and I&#39;d  <br/>
change the words every few days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882058796">Last night my son encountered 51 divided by 51 in a game he was playing online.  I was <br/>
with him and read it out loud, and my daughter said, &quot;Huh?.&quot;  I replied, &quot;If there were 51 <br/>
kids and 51 dollars, how much money would each kid get?&quot;  She got that right away!  Lol  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve started an allowance again after the thread that came up.  Both kids are totally <br/>
ready for it now, so I&#39;m so glad it came up here and I didn&#39;t continue to think they weren&#39;t <br/>
interested!  We&#39;ve had great fun with it.   I think they had some fear that if they got an <br/>
allowance I wouldn&#39;t buy them anything anymore.  That didn&#39;t come from me, but maybe a <br/>
tv show or something.....<br/>

decimal one spot to the left :) and viola, there&#39;s your discount! I would<br/>
sometimes do the math to give them the resulting net cost, though Hayden has<br/>
always had a natural knack for the rhythm of numbers, he does the most of<br/>
his own computing in his head. Either exact maniuplations for exacting<br/>
answers ($10/month = X/day) or he&#39;ll fearlessly estimate and round off (in<br/>
about X months I can have about enough for whatever cool thing I&#39;m dreaming<br/>
of today).<br/>
The local sales tax was near 5% (in SD) and the kids could quickly figure<br/>
10% and divide it in half (50%!!) and know their tax debt. We really<br/>
impressed the gramma when Hayden asked the local tax rate while we were in<br/>
LA (9.5%) and he protested having to give away 10 cents for every dollar he<br/>
spent on vacation!! (aha! a &quot;value of money&quot; moment!) He was pretty excited<br/>
to know we live without those taxes now (and he&#39;s far more removed from<br/>
consequences of a state income tax than sales tax!)<br/>
<br/>
We had a great many talks about angles and circles and pi and skirt making<br/>
and van+trailer manipulations and skateboarding tricks, as we drove across<br/>
the country last October... The shear winds had me thinking of lift/drag and<br/>
friction and all kinds of other miscellaneous engineering information that<br/>
was waiting for something relative to show up in my life :) to which it<br/>
could apply itself. I was so glad to have that moment to share these cool<br/>
concepts with Hayden; it&#39;s part of the whole Road Trip with Mama experience,<br/>
instead of the dry ol&#39; algebra/geometry teacher who spit when he talked<br/>
