<div id="ygrps-yiv-723678383">Hi,<br/>
Is it that we assume children would behave a certain way?  You know what<br/>
they say about assuming?  it can make a ass of me and you.<br/>
When Lewis was 18 months old, we went to a live concert with him.  We<br/>
assumed, very wrongly, that he may disturbed the audience, or fall asleep,<br/>
or fuss for a meal.  To make sure I could go out easily,  I sat on the isle<br/>
with him. He watched the whole concert with rapture attention and only<br/>
napped during the intermission.<br/>
It was a learning experience for me. He now has been to more shows,<br/>
concerts, plays and sport events, than I had been by my adult age: and he&#39;s<br/>
only 9 . Once he fell asleep during a modern ballet show. But we were dozing<br/>
off too.<br/>
The point is, I didn&#39;t make him sit down and shut up. There was plenty of<br/>
example about how to behave in theatres and he learned from them.<br/>
A few years back we went to a play organised by our local home education<br/>
group. Three quarters of the room was filled with public school children.<br/>
They were wild, like animals out of their cage. Lewis leaned on me at one<br/>
point and said: &quot;They don&#39;t know how to behave in theatre.  I hope they will<br/>
shut up during the play.&quot;<br/>
Enough story for today.<br/>
Friendship<br/>
Lucie<br/>
<br/>
One of the most tragic things I know about human nature is<br/>
that all of us tend to put off living. We are all dreaming<br/>
of some magical rose garden over the horizon, instead of<br/>
enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows<br/>
today.<br/>
