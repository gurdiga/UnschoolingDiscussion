<div id="ygrps-yiv-738695370">That reminds me of a CD we have called &quot;Free To Be You and ME&quot;, Marlo Thomas <br/>
had it made for her niece ( I think it was, story is inside on the jacket). <br/>
There is a song on it called &quot;William Wants A Doll&quot;, pretty much the same as <br/>
you said only a song. The entire CD is AWESOME! I had it when I was growing <br/>
up, then bought for my kidlets, we went through 2 tapes and finally bought <br/>
the CD, lasts much longer :)<br/>

&gt;We just finished &quot;Lady Daisy&quot;.  A 9 year old boy finds a Victorian era<br/>
&gt;doll in his Grandmother&#39;s attic.  She lets him keep it, but he has to<br/>
&gt;deal with his Dad and a boy at school giving him a hard time about it.<br/>
&gt;(The parts about school are only very small parts of the story.)  The<br/>
&gt;doll talks, but of course, grownups can&#39;t hear it.  An absolutely<br/>
&gt;wonderful story, that had me with tears in my eyes at the end.<br/>

&gt;Did you eat your 5 today?<br/>
&gt;(fruits and vegetables, that is!)<br/>
