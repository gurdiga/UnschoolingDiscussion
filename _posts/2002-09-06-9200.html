<div id="ygrps-yiv-132576622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My experience is that sex education is best done in<br/>
&gt;the car.  <br/>
&gt;....The big advantage, of course, is that when the<br/>
&gt;parent is driving, eye contact is impossible. You can<br/>
&gt;have all kinds of potentially embarassing <br/>
&gt;conversations without having to look at one another. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This brings to mind a bitter example of similar usage<br/>
of the &quot;easy-no-eye-contact&quot; conversations in cars. <br/>
My oldest brother once told me that it was how my<br/>
father told him and his siblings (his first four<br/>
children from his first marriage) that he was<br/>
divorcing their mother.  They were all in the backseat<br/>
and my father was driving.  I commented, &quot;How<br/>
convienient,  Not only did he have you captive, unable<br/>
to storm out or react how you needed to at the time,<br/>
but he didn&#39;t even have to look you in the eye while<br/>
he said it.&quot;  EXACTLY!  was what my brother said, and<br/>
was amazed that I had seen it so clearly from such a<br/>
distance of time.  But then, we did have the same<br/>
father after all.  Typical cowardly, controlling,<br/>
dominating behavior.<br/>
<br/>
But I am glad to know that there is a positive aspect<br/>
to this &quot;indirect&quot; conversation possible in cars, for<br/>
awkward discussions that children WANT to have. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
