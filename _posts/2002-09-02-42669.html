Sandra, I read once, somewhere, in an introduction to something you wrote or <br/>
something someone wrote about you, (or maybe I imagined it all! Correct me if <br/>
I am wrong.) that you once discouraged a friend or family member (?) from <br/>
homeschooling. I think it said that at one time, you were totally against <br/>
homeschooling and had talked this person out of homeschooling their kids, and <br/>
then later, you had made a complete 360 and now here you are! If this is <br/>
true, what is it that made you decide to do all that you have done? I also <br/>
wonder if there are others here who have done this as well? Has anyone came <br/>
from being against homeschooling for what ever reason and now supports it so <br/>
much? Why, how come, and what made the difference??<br/>

My cousin Nada Trujillo.  When her first (of eventually five) was nearly <br/>
schoolage, I was a new teacher and all excited about it, and she said &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
thinking of homeschooling Paul,&quot; and I said that was no good, what about <br/>
this, what about that, what about socialization, what if all the smart kids <br/>
were taken out of school, blah blah blah...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If this is true, what is it that made you decide to do all that you have <br/>
done?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I felt really bad when I realized what a tacky bad thing I had done, and <br/>
called her almost that second.  The bad thing was, she was down to three or <br/>
for kids still in school (one almost out of high school, I think--the second <br/>
one, a girl).  Some did come home, even that year.  All ended up back for <br/>
basketball at some point.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Has anyone came <br/>
from being against homeschooling for what ever reason and now supports it so <br/>
much? Why, how come, and what made the difference??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d guess most people were against it vaguely when it first came up, whether <br/>
from  years of justification and trust that the arguments given us had <br/>
validity, or the Stockholm Syndrome (being discussed here or somewhere today <br/>
in relation to a kneejerk defense of school).<br/>
<br/>
I was at a La Leche League playgroup meeting, sitting on a blanket with five <br/>
or six other moms I knew well, at Hoffman Park in Albuquerque.  I remember <br/>
the whole day, the sky, etc., because I had a lifechanging moment.   It&#39;s <br/>
when I first considered MAYBE considering homeschooling.  I think Kirby was <br/>
only three so it wasn&#39;t a real consideration yet.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Rhiannon (I still know her, saw her at the store Wednesday) was <br/>
saying she was thinking of homeschooling.  Some of the people there were <br/>
homeschoolers, most weren&#39;t, most didn&#39;t have schoolaged kids.   <br/>
<br/>
I gave a teacherly argument against it, in a way, in answering one of the <br/>
moms&#39; question about WHY schools were so against homeschooling.  I said <br/>
(truly, I still believe it, but it&#39;s not the ONLY reason)  &quot;They&#39;re afraid of <br/>
people buttf***** their kids.&quot;  It was too blunt for that group that day too, <br/>
but I blurted it out because so many parents seem to think that there are NO <br/>
horribly abusive families.  And from the inside of the school, I think most <br/>
teachers have known kids who would miss a week of school and it was because <br/>
the bruises needed time to heal.  I had one, a teenaged girl who was probably <br/>
also being sexually assaulted by her dad.  I didn&#39;t do anything and it haunts <br/>
me and will haunt me until I die.<br/>
<br/>
I said to Rhainnon, &quot;What if Lily would like school as much as I did?&quot;  (and <br/>
I truly did have some of my best times ever in school, in band, in choir, <br/>
hanging out with teachers during the 40 minutes I waited for the bus every <br/>
day, getting to know the librarian...)  I thought it was a pretty powerful <br/>
question and I&#39;d win that round.<br/>
<br/>
Rhiannon calmly said something very like, &quot;What if Kirby hates if as much as <br/>
I did?  Most people do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rhiannon won, hands down.<br/>
<br/>
Because while I DID like school, I knew from third grade that the majority of <br/>
the kids did not, and that some were crushed by it, by being retained a <br/>
grade, by not speaking English well enough and there being a rule against <br/>
even asking a question or playing at recess in Spanish, and some were <br/>
socially eroded by lack of popularity, or incessant teasing.  And some killed <br/>
themselves.  Two of my friends had shot themselves in the head rather than <br/>
face the next day.  One when we were 14, one when we were 15.<br/>
<br/>
And so at that moment, homeschooling because a viable option for us.<br/>

It&#39;s Russian.<br/>
Her mom named her after a hairdresser in Fort Worth.  Then she named the <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ha!  I did a 180, but up until now I&#39;ve been too proud to admit it.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
My brother told me in early 1996 that he was thinking about <br/>
homeschooling his girls.  He was very (overly, IMO) worried for their <br/>
safety if they had to leave the nest of Catholic school and move in to <br/>
public school in 6th grade.  (In their area, Catholic school only went <br/>
to 5th.)<br/>
<br/>
I tried to talk him out of it.  I used the usual objections--and I added <br/>
that I thought it was &quot;easy for him to say&quot;, when he travels most of the <br/>
week and his wife would be stuck home doing it all without him. <br/>
 Socialization, yada, yada.  Since I was a Southern Baptist at the time, <br/>
I even said he had an obligation to the unsaved masses to keep his <br/>
children in school as a good example.  (:::excuse me while I blush at my <br/>
own arrogance:::::I didn&#39;t even understand that Catholics weren&#39;t <br/>
interested in &quot;saving&quot; people.)<br/>
<br/>
He had obviously read up on it, and gave me some good arguments about <br/>
socialization and the crowd control issues of school, etc.  In the end, <br/>
he decided to devote his efforts to convincing their school to hire a <br/>
6th grade teacher, which they did.  I never spoke with him about why he <br/>
decided that.  (I&#39;ll bet he doesn&#39;t know that his eldest daughter, now <br/>
17, has complained for years to my father about Catholic school, and how <br/>
she is never going to church again once she leaves my brother&#39;s house.)<br/>
<br/>
It was in October of that year that my mid-kid&#39;s experience with middle <br/>
school reached critical mass.  He got suspended for fighting, under that <br/>
zero tolerance policy that apparently didn&#39;t apply to the girl he was <br/>
fighting with.  (I&#39;m not bitter anymore...well, maybe just a little. <br/>
 lol)  When I got the phone call from the principal and heard the story, <br/>
I *instantly* thought of homeschooling and my conversations with my <br/>
brother.  My son never went back.  <br/>
<br/>
But seriously, how can I be bitter about an incident that has led to the <br/>
most wonderful, joyful living I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I&#39;m thankful to my <br/>
brother that he brought it up, too.  Who knows what would have happened <br/>
if I had never heard of homeschooling?  Life hasn&#39;t always been rosy, <br/>
but I shudder to think what my son might have been like if he had been <br/>
treated the way he was in school for 6 more years.  All five of us have <br/>
benefitted, but his little brother is the one who is getting the best <br/>
part.  Never being forced to go to school at all.  <br/>

Here&#39;s the sad irony:<br/>
<br/>
Rhiannon&#39;s kids went to school.<br/>
<br/>
Their dad was training as an elementary teacher and was willing for them to <br/>
stay home IF... if...  if... and then the parents got divorced and the girls <br/>
ended up in alternative programs a bit and then decided regular school was <br/>
better than dealing with the dad&#39;s nervous concern.  <br/>
<br/>
If their dad had only taken Ritalin, they might have been happily <br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the same neighborhood with both parents and the kids (they bought <br/>
a second house walking distance from the first), and the girls did okay, but <br/>
they definitely picked up the tight self-consciousness of what they wear, who <br/>
they know, what they read, do, listen to, like...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992876842">-Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a degree in elementary education and psychology.  I got my <br/>
psychology degree first and then worked in a daycare with infants for <br/>
several months, two year olds for several months--I later had those <br/>
same two year olds in my preschool class.  I then worked in a  <br/>
Montessori school for a couple of years before I decided to get my <br/>
el. ed. license.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I saw in the ps during practicumms and student teaching, along <br/>
with kids I knew, left me knowing one thing--that young children are <br/>
fascinated with the world, thirst to know more about it, and revel in <br/>
learning but by the time many reach second grade or so they view it <br/>
as drudgery.  So I was left with the vague notion that there must be <br/>
something about the way schools do what they do that turns children <br/>
off.  I knew (from what I learned in my psych classes about how <br/>
learning happens) that it revolved around the fact that people learn <br/>
what they care about and how they can fit new info into already <br/>
existing connections and that people make these connections very <br/>
differently.  I knew from my own experience in ps that learning for <br/>
me, in that context,  meant figuring out what the teachers wanted, <br/>
memorizing it so I could spit it back to them and then promptly <br/>
forgetting most of it.  I saw that even if I wanted to base my <br/>
classroom around child-led learning and intrinsic motivation, it <br/>
would be very difficult to do in most ps what with grades, and <br/>
standardized testing and school wide &quot;management&quot; systems.  Not to <br/>
mention that parents wanted feedback in the form of grades and test <br/>
scores so saying something like &quot;Zach is really good at figuring out <br/>
how machines work&quot; wouldn&#39;t cut if for most.<br/>
<br/>
So, then I had kids and stayed home with them.  Sent my kids to <br/>
preschool and ps until about a year and a half ago.  I had a friend  <br/>
who homeschooled (school at home) her kids for religious reasons and <br/>
we had many discussions with me saying that hsing was not a good <br/>
thing and kids needed the exposure of schools.  I really thought that <br/>
if I was an involved parent and supplemented my kids interests at <br/>
home that schools would be fine.  My oldest child hated school, from <br/>
the Montessori preschool he went to through the second grade at ps he <br/>
attended.  We couldn&#39;t afford private schools because we felt it was <br/>
more important for me to be home with them than to work to pay for <br/>
it.  I really didn&#39;t view hsing as an option, I thought hsers were <br/>
religious conservatives who wanted to make sure that their views <br/>
weren&#39;t questioned by their children too early. <br/>
<br/>
What changed my mind?  Well, my son was becoming very negative to any <br/>
experiences at home that resembled learning, was almost always in a <br/>
bad mood when he came home.  I read a book called &quot;Coloring Outside <br/>
the Lines&quot; in which a man who designed artificial intelligence for <br/>
computers and therefore had studied a lot about how learning works, <br/>
wrote about how to get your kids through public school with their <br/>
critical thinking, creativity and love of learning in tact.  It <br/>
echoed what I already knew, that most ps were not environments in <br/>
which real learning could thrive.  Bush became president and I knew <br/>
if his education plan were implemented things would only get worse.<br/>
I thought about what I wanted most for my children.  It was to grow <br/>
up to be kind, thoughtful people who followed their hearts and <br/>
desires and what they thought to be right without regard to what <br/>
others thought.  Well then it was like duh! if that is what I want <br/>
for me kids then I better start modeling it and psing would only <br/>
hinder most of my hopes for them.  So we started hsing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While learning about hsing it didn&#39;t take me long to stumble across <br/>
unschooling and it resonated with me right away and here I am.  And <br/>
even though I really believe it is right I still struggle with the <br/>
trust thing sometimes.  And I still struggle with the perceptions of <br/>
others when they ask my kids about their hsing and they say things <br/>
like &quot;We don&#39;t do school, we just play.&quot;  And I believe that is <br/>
because I don&#39;t have the trust thing down yet. But I am getting <br/>
better and reading here and other places helps a lot. <br/>

they&#39;re not learning how to get along in the world (often by parental <br/>
design).  They&#39;re not learning enough to get into state universities (because <br/>
some are learning a fantasy form of science and history), but the parents <br/>
don&#39;t intend for them to GO to state universities.  They&#39;ll go to Christian <br/>
colleges or they won&#39;t go at all (think the parents).<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m torn sometimes and rarely defend homeschooling as a block of life or <br/>
behavior.  When talking to &quot;outsiders,&quot; I almost always first qualify that we <br/>
are not religious school-at-home homeschoolers, that we don&#39;t &quot;do school.&quot;  <br/>
Then I talk about how homeschooling as we do it doesn&#39;t creat school or <br/>
school-at-home problems.<br/>

- her choice.  The boys will learn blue collar trades so they can support <br/>
the families they&#39;ll be starting early.  The girls will get married <br/>
early.  The girls wear dresses and head scarves.  I suppose you&#39;ve guessed <br/>
that spanking is their main form of discipline . . . sigh.<br/>
