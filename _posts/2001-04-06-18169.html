<div>Hello, </div>
<div>&nbsp; Species have gone into extinction thousands of years before man, and 
I am not sure I believe everything I have read or have learned about that 
either. I find it interesting that&nbsp;most every modern day animal has a 
dinosaurs ancestor, and&nbsp;many dinosaurs can be compared to a modern day 
animal.&nbsp;Maybe ancient dinosaurs weren&#39;t as killed off as scientists have 
been proclaiming, but their bodies have adapted to the changing earth. Every 
scientific fact I have ever read is subjective, so I don&#39;t know how one can take 
that as positive proof about anything. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It does pain me to hear about all of the animals, plants, and water ways, 
etc. to be on the endangered lists, but more and more people are changing their 
outlook and taking it upon themselves to actually help.&nbsp; My children, and 
every other child I know have so much knowledge these issues that I have great 
expectations for the future. </div>
