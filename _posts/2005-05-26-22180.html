 </span></blockquote>Hey there!  I&#39;m the San Diego County contact for HSC, and the contact <br/>
person for Tecolote Park Day, which meets on Tuesdays.  Tecolote is not <br/>
exclusively unschoolers, but it is inclusive (non-religious) and quite <br/>
active.  Well, active in an unschooly way &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s the haven for <br/>
Junior Theater parents, who are otherwise very busy!  There is also an <br/>
unschooler&#39;s park day in San Diego, but it seems to cater to younger <br/>
kids, and mine are Elder Kids now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748561773">Thank you for the information Nancy, Dana, & Sandra! At this point, we <br/>
aren&#39;t sure if we will be moving or not, so I may have some questions <br/>
in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
