They were alone in the house. It was a cold, dark, stormy night. The storm<br/>
had come up quickly, and each time the thunder boomed, he watched her jump.<br/>
She looked across the room and admired his strong appearance. She wished<br/>
that he would take her in his arms, comfort her, protect her from the storm.<br/>
She wanted that...<br/>
Then the power went out.<br/>
She screamed.<br/>
He raced to the sofa where she was cowering. He did not hesitate to pull her<br/>
into his arms. He knew this was a forbidden union and expected her to pull<br/>
back. He was surprised when she didn&#39;t resist, but instead clung to him.<br/>
The storm raged on, as did their growing passion, and there came a moment<br/>
when each knew that they had to be together. They knew it was wrong. Their<br/>
families would not understand.<br/>
But they were so consumed in their passion they didn&#39;t hear the door or the<br/>
click of the light switch.<br/>
The power was back on....... click<br/>
