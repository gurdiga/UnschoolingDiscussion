<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047226130">SIX HUMANS <br/>
Six humans trapped by happenstance <br/>
In black and bitter cold; <br/>
<br/>
one possessed a stick of wood, <br/>
Or so the story&#39;s told. <br/>
<br/>
Their dying fire in need of logs, <br/>
The first woman held her&#39;s back, <br/>
For on the faces around the fire, <br/>
She noticed one was black. <br/>
<br/>
The next man looking across the way <br/>
Saw one not of his church, <br/>
And couldn&#39;t bring himself to give <br/>
The fire his stick of birch. <br/>
<br/>
The third one sat in tattered clothes - <br/>
He gave his coat a hitch; <br/>
Why should his log be put to use <br/>
To warm the idle rich? <br/>
<br/>
The rich man just sat back and thought <br/>
Of the wealth he had in store, <br/>
And how to keep what he had earned <br/>
From the lazy, shiftless poor. <br/>
<br/>
The black man&#39;s face bespoke revenge <br/>
As the fire passed from his sight; <br/>
For all he saw in his stick of wood <br/>
Was a chance to spite the white. <br/>
<br/>
And the last man of this forlorn group <br/>
Did naught except for gain; <br/>
Giving only to those who gave, <br/>
Was how he played the game. <br/>
<br/>
The logs held tight in death&#39;s still hands <br/>
Was proof of human sin. <br/>
They didn&#39;t die from the cold without, <br/>
They died from the cold within. <br/>
