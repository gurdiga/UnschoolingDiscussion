<div id="ygrps-yiv-835022555">I&#39;m also from Maine and if NH is anything like here, I don&#39;t think it would<br/>
be possible to do anything but public school. We adopted three of our foster<br/>
children and put up with Head Start and public school until all three were<br/>
adopted. We did sneakily practice attachment parenting for the two who came<br/>
to us as infants, but had to get their pediatrician to write a note saying<br/>
that it was a medical neccessity for them to sleep in our room. (One had<br/>
severe asthma and the other has reactive attachment disorder.) We had a crib<br/>
in there for show, but they were only in it for naps from time to time. When<br/>
they got old enough to tell the social worker that they slept in our bed,<br/>
we&#39;d say they&#39;d had a bad nightmare or try to change the subject. It was<br/>
very difficult and not the way I would have preferred to raise infants, but<br/>
we did the best we could and got them adopted as soon as possible. They<br/>
prefer their own space now, but still crawl in with us once in a while,<br/>
sometimes bringing their cats and dog, which makes sleeping very<br/>
challenging, but warm and cozy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009205181">In Oklahoma they allowed us to homeschool our pre-adoptive children.  Our birth children we either in their teens or grown, one was already out of the house.  The adoptive children were 6 & 7.  That amount of space was very helpful.  They have no detachment disorder, nor any FAS nor were drug infected.  The absence of these things make a huge difference.  They are now 11 and 12.  If you didn&#39;t know they had previously been in foster care, you would never guess.  They are very happy, well-adjusted kids.  It took time, was a LOT of hard work, harder than we expected.  Even under what I would consider the best of circumstances.  If you birth children are nearly grown and you have a heart for adoption through the foster care system, the rewards are great.  My younger kiddos have been loads of fun. :0)<br/>
