Subject: [AlwaysLearning] broken-leg report (skip it if you already know the<br/>
story)<br/>

<br/>
I have broken my leg again.  The last time was in July, 1985, so breaking it<br/>
again October 11th 2002 isn&#39;t TOO frequent, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well it is too frequent because it inconveniences a lot of people and puts<br/>
much of our everyday lives at a standstill.  Keith was saintly the first<br/>
time<br/>
and we didn’t have any children yet.  This time the kids will get much of<br/>
the<br/>
workload, with Keith still being saintly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The big inconvenience this time was I was in South Carolina to speak at a<br/>
homeschooling conference, and I was on my way to the opening remarks and<br/>
intro, after which I was doing a keynote speech.  I had a talk and a<br/>
workshop<br/>
scheduled for Saturday, a workshop for Sunday and the farewell address.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Between the second floors of the two buildings in the hotel was a ramp.  Too<br/>
steep, too slippery, some kind of indoor/outdoor carpet on it, and I went<br/>
down.  This wasn&#39;t the foot I sprained a month ago, but the other one, the<br/>
left one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty was not far behind me, several people were on the little patio at the<br/>
end of the ramp. Paramedics came.  Nice women, smart, friendly, but they had<br/>
a gurney that only cranked down to about 18&quot; off the ground.  I was afraid<br/>
to<br/>
stand up on the lately-sprained left foot, ON that ramp, still slippery, so<br/>
they got firemen to put me on the gurney.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My first ambulance ride!  One of the homeschooling moms, Kathryn, went with<br/>
me.  They took me  to a VERY near hospital, a mile or less up the road,<br/>
Palmetto Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spent several hours in a little closed room in the emergency area, hoping<br/>
I<br/>
could have surgery that evening.  It seemed possible, but didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
X-rays showed breaks just above the ankle on both bones.  (Not nearly as bad<br/>
as the 1985 breaks.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was not happy thatI was going to miss the first alternative homeschooling<br/>
conference in the southeastern U.S., and I felt horrible for letting people<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Surgery was noon Saturday and I hoped that I could leave the next afternoon<br/>
in a wheelchair to at least do the closing speech, or that maybe the hotel<br/>
could bring conference people in a bus to some big room at the hospital or<br/>
SOMETHING, but on Sunday I was sick from post-op this&#39;n&#39;that, and throwing<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a dozen visitors, all of whom assured me that although I was missed,<br/>
the conference was wonderful and people were meeting others and learning a<br/>
ton.  That was good to hear, but also sad because I wasn&#39;t getting to meet<br/>
everyone, and the morphine drip was keeping me from being equally alert at<br/>
all times.  I was zoning out, but it was keeping the pain down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty sat in on the panel discussion in my place, and seemed really happy<br/>
about having done so.  He made a good impression on lots of people there.  I<br/>
heard reports about how good he was at helping the younger kids with games,<br/>
that he seemed more mature than they expected of a thirteen year old, and<br/>
that he was handling the stress very well.  I was grateful to people for<br/>
bringing him to see me in the hospital, and we talked on the phone some too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because of this accident , the hotel will make concessions for next year&#39;s<br/>
conference, I hope, and the room Marty and I had, he stayed in free for four<br/>
nights.   Anne Ohman was right next door to Marty and Joyce Fetteroll past<br/>
that.  Mary Gold was down a couple of floors.  They all helped Marty out on<br/>
the weekend, and Anne and Joyce had video-game-playing kids with them, and<br/>
so<br/>
there was some good interaction about that, some sight-seeing, some trips to<br/>
good kid-food places (since they had a van).    So IF they fix that ramp and<br/>
are as  helpful to Kelly Lovejoy, our hostess and organizer, as they need to<br/>
be, we&#39;ll try again next year.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, thank you for ALL your help, and the ride to the airport.  Even<br/>
though<br/>
it wasn&#39;t &quot;a good weekend&quot; for me, I had a great time being with you and<br/>
your<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We flew home as scheduled, with me being carried up the steps in a special<br/>
chair to the Canadair jet, and down (flight to Cincinnatti) and then helped<br/>
into a first class seat on the 737 for the rest of the flight home.  My foot<br/>
didn&#39;t hurt as much as I had been afraid it would, I didn&#39;t get woozy, and I<br/>
didn&#39;t need to try to use an airplane bathroom, so my fears were happily<br/>
<br/>
unmet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of the four flat levels of the house, I&#39;ve been stationed in the den so I<br/>
can<br/>
get to &quot;the cat bathroom&quot; and the office, but the first night home I was in<br/>
my OWN bed, next to Keith, and that was good.  It was dark and quiet and the<br/>
mattress and pillow weren&#39;t plastic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll probably end up deleting some of the yahoogroups mail because it&#39;s<br/>
quite<br/>
piled up.  It might take me a bit to get through all the personal mail too,<br/>
but I figured one report on this to everyone would keep me from having to<br/>
retell it (because it hurts my leg and my feelings every time I tell it) and<br/>
it will give people a heads up on why I might be flakey or a no-show in the<br/>
next few weeks.  (Kathy, we need to reschedule that lunch; Helena, I can&#39;t<br/>
do<br/>
a Jasmine pick-up or delivery as I should have; Jeff and Mike, music<br/>
practice<br/>
will need to be here or not at all for a while, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No weight on it for six weeks is what they told me in South Carolina.  I<br/>
guess maybe that means after six weeks I can get a walking cast, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know.  I guess I&#39;ll see a Lovelace ortho-guy next week to see x-rays and get<br/>
a preview of my coming weeks.  They put pins in one bone and a plate and<br/>
pins<br/>
in the other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m safe at home and will try not to bring down the<br/>
happiness of those around me.  I can only sit up a while at a time now.  I<br/>
have a wheelchair and a walker.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When some of the photos of me are available, I&#39;ll put them on a website so<br/>
you can see me downed on the ground, and in the hospital if you want more of<br/>
the full effect.   I&#39;ve been to South Carolina twice now, and been in the<br/>
hospital both times (well, the first time my parents were living in Aiken<br/>
and<br/>
went across the border to Augusta, Georgia, for my birth, so maybe that<br/>
doesn&#39;t count).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry for the inconveniences this will cause in the coming weeks.<br/>
I have movies to watch and books to read and kids to hang out with, and I&#39;ll<br/>
be able to sit at the computer longer as time goes on, so I&#39;m not lonely in<br/>
a<br/>
quiet home alone at all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All o&#39;ya&#39;ll be careful walking on wet ramps.  (Add that to your list of<br/>
things to watch out for.)<br/>
