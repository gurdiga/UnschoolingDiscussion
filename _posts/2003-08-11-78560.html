Have you tried the Flylady.net.   I now clean in 15 min incriments at a<br/>
time.  You&#39;d be surprised how much you can get done in such a short time.  I<br/>
couldn&#39;t do her whole routine, and I don&#39;t get her individual emails, but I<br/>
took from her what worked and left what didn&#39;t.<br/>

could offer advice, but I just can&#39;t, except to say to try not to let it<br/>
stress you out as much as it does me.  How&#39;s that for advice?  The blind<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone managed to strike a balance in this area? Or is it impossible?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much close to impossible!  ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
This is an area I&#39;ve been fiddling around with over the last few months trying to strike a reasonable balance.  A couple of things I&#39;ve found to be the biggest help are actually behaviour shifts for me.<br/>
<br/>
One is to just do little things as I come across them, not wait until I have &quot;the time&quot;.  For example, if I notice dried spill or something, instead of thinking &quot;oh, I&#39;ll have to remember to get that the next time I clean my room&quot;, I just take a minute to do it then.  It truly only takes a minute and makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Second is not to get locked into the &quot;proper&quot; way to clean things.  If I&#39;m throwing a towel in the dirty clothes, I&#39;ll take a minute to use it to dust my dresser or wipe the bathroom counter if either of those things are messy before I toss it.<br/>
<br/>
Along with trying to do a bit each day, whenever it seems to fit in, I find these two things help the house last longer before it needs an overhaul. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other thing, if I&#39;m hanging around with the kids in the kitchen, TV room, basement etc. I&#39;ll take a sec to decide if I can tidy up.  If we&#39;re chatting or watching a show I can usually tidy up at the same time.  But I won&#39;t do this if it takes away from what we&#39;re doing together.<br/>

&gt; Has anyone managed to strike a balance in this area? Or is it impossible?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea!!  Something I can really help with!<br/>
<br/>
6 kids, my husband and I, all living in a tiny house, I&#39;ve definately gotten <br/>
this down pat over the years.  <br/>
<br/>
#1, no, my house is not even close to spotless.  Haven&#39;t cleaned the windows <br/>
in a long time.  But I have a few things that have worked great for me.  <br/>
<br/>
At least once every 2 to 3 months, I just get a cleaning bug and tell the <br/>
kids to do whatever they want...watch movies, play videos, etc.  Sometimes <br/>
they&#39;ll go to a friend&#39;s house for the day, or even better, Chuck will take them <br/>
someplace that takes all day (there&#39;s a cool hobby shop about 2 hours away they <br/>
make a trek to once in a while.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I start at the front door.  I take a wet rag and maybe some 409 with me, <br/>
and (this is the key) a heavy cardboard box, a large empty laundry basket, <br/>
and a trash can (you can put them in the middle of the room you&#39;re working in).  <br/>
I begin moving to the right, and just sort of go along the walls of the <br/>
house, (A) putting things in the basket that belong in other rooms or out in the <br/>
shed, (B) putting things for goodwill or a garage sale in the box, and (C) trash <br/>
in the trashcan.  I lightly wipe things down as I go, but this is more of a <br/>
decluttering.  Any cupboard, drawer, closet, underneath of something (like a <br/>
bed) I come to, I go through, throwing out tons and tons of stuff that has just <br/>
been collecting dust.  Sometimes this process can take an entire day, or more <br/>
(I have known people who need a day for each room).  When the whole house is <br/>
done, I&#39;ll go back and do a little more soapy cleaning.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don&#39;t have a really big emotional attachment to &quot;things&quot; it&#39;s not <br/>
hard for me to get rid of a bunch of stuff.  Sometimes this process can take an <br/>
entire day, or more (I have known people who need a day for each room).  When <br/>
the whole house is done, I&#39;ll go back and do a little more soapy cleaning.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned a long time ago, when we were close friends with a couple Mennonite <br/>
families, how much of our lives are wasted on things...clutter, material <br/>
junk, papers.  Life is too short and your children are small for a tiny fraction <br/>
of that.  If you can go through the whole house once and really declutter, you <br/>
can use this same process (just with a trashbag and basket for misplaces <br/>
stuff) once a day and be done in less than an hour, including other chores.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089881729">A shift in my focus has helped me.  My focus isn&#39;t to keep my house together,  its to keep my kids &quot;together&quot;.  Together meaning, psychologically &quot;together&quot;.  Them knowing that they are more important than housework.  And instead of seeing the messes all over my house, I can now see all that they are doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Like right now in the basement:  we have an igloo started, that turned into a circle for a powwow,  we had a powwow with refreshments(breakfast), bionicle pieces all over in another section,  (Alec got some new guys and you have to combine them to make this &quot;humungous&quot; guy), fisher price cash register out with food to buy.<br/>
<br/>
So as far as balance,  I think right now the kids and their learning out weigh the house being together.  So there probably isn&#39;t one :)   And that&#39;s OK.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**I know if I had left the house I would have felt guilty all day for leaving<br/>
it in such a state, especially when Mark gets home to it.**<br/>
<br/>
I used to do that to myself too;  wanted the house together,  kids happy,  dh happy cause the house was together.  (I thought that&#39;s what he would want) But you know what,  after lots of conversations with dh, he would much rather have a happy family than a perfect house.  Maybe you could talk with your dh about that,  maybe he isn&#39;t really bothered by it as much as you feel?<br/>
<br/>
There are days that I have to do some housework, like today, laundry.  Sometimes my kids understand, sometimes they don&#39;t.  But we talk about it and know that it is something that has to be done,  or else, no clean clothes!  &lt;g&gt; Which happens sometimes too and we all survived!  :)   Also, I try and be with them as I am doing things, like folding clothes by my son playing the gamecube.   Asking them if they want to help.  Sometimes they want to, sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; Julie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that it&#39;s hard, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s impossible.  It&#39;s just <br/>
awareness.  If the kids are doing things that need a lot of your input, then cleaning <br/>
all day instead of being around for them wouldn&#39;t work. Plus, they would just <br/>
interrupt you constantly, hehehe, right?  You wouldn&#39;t get much done anyway.  <br/>
 But if it&#39;s a day where they are really involved with stuff and don&#39;t need <br/>
you as much, which happens more and more as my son gets older, then it would be <br/>
a good day to polish the silver, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Of course, sometimes I do start a project and then he wants to do something <br/>
with me, and because I like to finish what I start, I do ask him to wait until <br/>
I am done.  Usually, by the time I am done, he&#39;s busy with something else.  <br/>
Or we agree on a time, in half an hour we&#39;ll play cards, for example.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And it&#39;s hard to get motivated to keep your<br/>
house clean once you get involved with what you&#39;re kids are doing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of times, I&#39;m around, straightening up around him, so I&#39;m there, but <br/>
not there.  He can ask me questions, interrupt me, I am just cleaning after all, <br/>
and, it helps him stay organized, and he can keep going with whatever he&#39;s <br/>
involved in.  I really don&#39;t often get deeply involved in his projects, anyway. <br/>
Right now we&#39;re both learning html, so there&#39;s a lot of back and forth, and <br/>
sharing what we just learned, and it&#39;s lovely.  But most of the time we&#39;re both <br/>
pretty independent.  <br/>
<br/>
I have routines, daily tasks to get done, and none of those things take more <br/>
than a few minutes at a pop.  I can straighten the whole house in 15 minutes <br/>
because I do it every day( or sometimes twice a day).  Alex is really good at <br/>
cleaning up after himself, or at least keeping the mess to one area, and that <br/>
works for me, I just ignore it until he&#39;s done and puts stuff away.  Sometimes <br/>
that takes days, ehehe, but I&#39;ve learned to let it go.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;especially when Mark gets home to it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the hubby makes remarks about tornados, lol.  We usually just look <br/>
at him and tell him what we were busy with all day, and then he either helps <br/>
us clean up, or goes and &quot;hides&quot; in our room until dinner.  Our bedroom is <br/>
basically off limits to Alex, that&#39;s our personal space, just like his room is <br/>
his.  That space is always clean,  I can&#39;t stand a messy bedroom!, and he does <br/>
spend time with us there, snuggling or whatever, but not often.  That works for <br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
If your kids are young, I know it can be hard to find balance, and I don&#39;t <br/>
think a spotless house should be a priority at that point, but as they get <br/>
older, things get more manageable.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Has anyone managed to strike a balance in this area? Or is it impossible?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been following this well so I may repeat something someone else<br/>
said. There is a balance that needs to be found in my house. My kids and my<br/>
husband don&#39;t have the same concerns about the house as I do. I&#39;m anal about<br/>
it. It&#39;s important for me to have my house look a certain. It makes me<br/>
happy. And when I&#39;m happy, I&#39;m a much better mom and wife. So it&#39;s worth it<br/>
to me, and to all of us really, to find that balance. But it is my<br/>
responsibility because I&#39;m the one that it matters to. It&#39;s not fair to make<br/>
what&#39;s important for me weigh down what also makes my family happy. So they<br/>
don&#39;t *have* anything they need to do as far as the house goes. I will ask<br/>
them to do something for me, and they do. I don&#39;t nag or ask meaning I only<br/>
expect a yes or make it so that they have no choice. I also don&#39;t ask for<br/>
too much. Their rooms are their rooms and when it may seem to get<br/>
overwhelming, my husband and I offer to help. They accept the help and the<br/>
room is cleaned up. They are happy and we are happy. This doesn&#39;t happen<br/>
often, maybe a couple times a year. The rest of the house is mine to take<br/>
care of. I never ask for help cleaning anything, just straightening up. And<br/>
the help from the kids comes only for their rooms and the playroom and the<br/>
dining room if they have been painting or creating all over the table.<br/>
<br/>
I find that taking a few minutes to straighten up or clean when the kids are<br/>
busy is life saving for me. I don&#39;t have a cleaning schedule. I don&#39;t have<br/>
certain days when certain things get done. I do try and put at least one<br/>
load of launfry in a day. That way I don&#39;t get overwhelmed with it. While<br/>
the kids are having breakfast and lunch is a great time for me to get things<br/>
done. That&#39;s usually a good half hour to vacuum and mop. Everything else can<br/>
get done in between play and kid time. I do things right as I see them if I<br/>
can, make sure I put everything away right after I use it. Grabbing short<br/>
periods of time to clean while the kids are busy doing something on their<br/>
own is what works for me. That way if I do get side tracked, it&#39;s not a big<br/>
deal or a major project I&#39;m in the middle of. About the only thing that I do<br/>
from start to finish and not asked for interruptions is when I clean the<br/>
carpets. Other than that, I get sidetracked all day and just go back and<br/>
finish when I&#39;m done or when I remember. Sometimes it takes me awhile to<br/>
remember. So I end up with wrinkled clothes from the dryer. Ironing at night<br/>
can be therapeutic too!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724380358">Thank you thank you thank you!!<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea about taking a day every couple of months just to clean<br/>
every so often. The kids would love the chance to go off with dad for the<br/>
day. And knowing that I had a day set aside would help with the guilty<br/>
feelings.  Making the most of the times that the kids are off doing their<br/>
own thing is helpful too.<br/>
<br/>
And I will just work on the feeling that I am a failure if my house looks<br/>
like a family with three young kids living in it! &lt;g&gt; I guess a part of that<br/>
is instead of just seeing a mess, see  it as hands-on learning!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking this morning that one problem is the lack of storage so I am<br/>
going to get another cupboard and some big tubs for the kids stuff. That<br/>
should help and make it easier for them to pack away also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Also, should you feel terribly ambitious :o), old books, collectibles, odds <br/>
and ends, sell really well on Ebay.  Last October my husband and I did a major <br/>
decluttering, sold the stuff we never use on Ebay, and got enough to pay for <br/>
the digital camera AND buy a new computer.  Plus we were able to do a bunch of <br/>
repairs on the house we&#39;d been needing to do.  You&#39;d be really surprised how <br/>
much something you never use could be worth.<br/>
<br/>
I had a book on Permaculture (more like a textbook, way over my head) that I <br/>
found out was out of print.  I had paid about 25.00 for it 5 years ago.  I <br/>
sold it on Ebay for 175.00!!!  I&#39;ve had a few books go for almost as much as I <br/>
paid for them a long time ago.  <br/>

WOW! I&#39;m headed for the bookshelves now. LOL Mark has been talking about<br/>
selling stuff on Ebay for awhile so that would definitely be worth looking<br/>
into. Also that would mean I have his help to declutter. &lt;g&gt; And we want to<br/>
get a digital camera soon, just have to do a bit of research before we buy.<br/>
Neither of us knows much about them.<br/>

But if you had only gotten $25 would you have felt like that was okay too?<br/>
<br/>
I put a couple of my out of print books on Amazon/used where they still sit, <br/>
but if I put them on e-Bay they&#39;d be gone by now.  Only thing is, I like the <br/>
books.  I just realize that I might never use them again before I die.  It&#39;s a <br/>
dilemma.  even if I just had the money back on books I&#39;ve bought and already <br/>
read and had a good time with (instead of the 25% a used bookstore MIGHT give <br/>
me) that should be a good deal, right?  But I&#39;m not mathish and I get stuck <br/>
thinking numbers.<br/>

a newer model, but we paid about 275.00 for it.  Hubby says they&#39;ve actually <br/>
come down in price.  But I&#39;m telling you, it paid for itself the first week we <br/>
sold stuff.  We are really happy with it, takes great pictures.<br/>

cheaper than marital counseling and years of therapy for the kids.  Plus, I save <br/>
a lot of money on groceries and air drying our laundry and other tightwad <br/>
things which ends up paying for it.  I pick up stuff every day and end up <br/>
vacuuming a lot because of our allergies.  But once every two weeks we do a major <br/>
purge of the accumulation and let her work her magic.<br/>
<br/>
I hosted my book group and had a dinner party all in one week a couple of <br/>
months ago.  I was an awful mom that week, the kind of mom I see a lot of and <br/>
don&#39;t enjoy being around.  The play-in-your-rooms, don&#39;t-get-the-glitter-out kind <br/>
of mom - for three whole days!  Even I couldn&#39;t live with myself.<br/>
