Sorry of your sad experience.<br/>
(I feel thesame way with my relatives who I visit and they believe in no god <br/>
and try cramming it down my throat.. but that is another topic...)<br/>
I just wanted to let you know I feel bad that your Pentecostal relatives<br/>
spend soooo much time on hell!<br/>
The Bible refers to hell only a few times.<br/>
BUT, it refers to LOVE many, many times.<br/>
Thus, the message for those believing and living the Bible, in my opinion, <br/>
would be its most spoken of message LOVE!<br/>
There is a verse that says, &quot;They will know us by our love&quot;.<br/>
I apologize because it just isn&#39;t happening, and I feel bad about it.<br/>
Preaching is a lot easier than living it!<br/>
Your relatives will one day reach the LOVE stage for truly that is what <br/>
Jesus&#39; message was mostly about!  Thus, those of us following Him should try <br/>
to exemplify this same pattern, is my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you will recover soon.<br/>
Again, I am sorry.  We aren&#39;t all like your relatives.<br/>
Bj<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  There is no saracasm or cynicism in this note so please don&#39;t read into <br/>
it as being of that nature.<br/>
I am sincere in my empathy!  (In other words, I am not wanting a bunch of <br/>
slams in return, for those of you who read into this, perhaps, as being <br/>
sarcastic or such.. thanks!)<br/>
