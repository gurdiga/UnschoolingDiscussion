<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086034837">First, some background. When Julian (now 12) left school after the third <br/>
grade, he hated to write. Not too surprising, given his only experience was <br/>
stupid sentences from his vocabulary words. He just didn&#39;t do any at all for <br/>
a long time.<br/>
<br/>
After he&#39;d been out of school for a while, I surprised him by inviting him to <br/>
go to a nearby cafe with me to eat goodies and write poetry. (if this sounds <br/>
manipulative, it&#39;s more my explanation than what happened. It was clear he <br/>
could say no to writing and yes to goodies.) He was so startled he said yes, <br/>
and we went off. I told him about haiku, and he wrote several poems that he <br/>
really liked. (This was his first experience writing something he liked.) <br/>
After that, he occasionally wrote poetry on his own, but mostly didn&#39;t write <br/>
much else.<br/>
<br/>
Julian&#39;s next big Writing Event came when my sister noticed an essay contest <br/>
about vegetarianism. He was about 10. Like other resources, I mentioned it, <br/>
but expected him to say no. He didn&#39;t...he enthusiastically said yes. He <br/>
ended up writing this brilliant essay about Vegetarianism as a Spiritual <br/>
Practice that not only went to the contest, but that he read as a sermon at <br/>
our church. <br/>
<br/>
Recently Julian decided to start writing more. He&#39;s been often going off to <br/>
the computer spontaneously and working on what I knew was a science fiction <br/>
story. He invited me to read it, saying he didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d like it. It <br/>
turned out to be a very space ship/technological piece with little <br/>
characterization or plot. When asked what I though, I said, &quot;This is very <br/>
different from the stories you usually like to read, or to tell.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said he knew that, and I asked him to tell me more about the story and his <br/>
writing it. He talked about how writing this made him less scared about <br/>
writing, and that he liked the process of doing it. He liked writing often, <br/>
but still feels insecure about it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if it was like practicing chords on the guitar -- very different <br/>
for him than  playing a song you intend to share, but more about getting used <br/>
to the process, in preparation for a future time when he might want to write <br/>
something he wants to share with the world. He said, &quot;That&#39;s exactly it,&quot; and <br/>
smiled.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s interesting to me, now, is talking about writing with another writer, <br/>
my son, and seeing that his process and his fears are much from mine. <br/>
However, he ends up supporting me in my writing at LEAST as much as I do him <br/>
in his. How cool is that?<br/>
