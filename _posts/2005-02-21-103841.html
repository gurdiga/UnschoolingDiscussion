Could  people who have opinions on the play date hot dog bribe story<br/>
(excerpted  below) please elaborate a bit on why they think it was or<br/>
wasn&#39;t  manipulative?  If I&#39;m counting right I saw two  &quot;non-manipulative<br/>
method of persuasion&quot; and no &quot;manipulation&quot; votes, and I  was a bit<br/>
surprised.  Was it primarily the happy ending, or do people  just not<br/>
find the series of events  manipulative?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
I thought it was a giant power struggle that happened to have a happy  <br/>
ending.  The mother threw down the guantlet over and over--she was just  lucky he <br/>
didn&#39;t pick it up as many times as she threw it down.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to force children to do what you want them to  do.  <br/>
Picking him up and carrying him in the house could have gone really  badly.  <br/>
What if he had chosen to fight or resist?  What good would  that have done?  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, he sat there in the car and then finally gave up and came in.   So he <br/>
had a good time.  But while he was out in the car, was he thinking  that no one <br/>
cared how he felt?  It&#39;s almost as if, given the mom&#39;s actions,  he had no <br/>
choice but to engage in the struggle.  Ultimately, he lost.   He had to forfeit. <br/>
 Mom&#39;s stronger and bigger and can&#39;t wait it out  longer.  I&#39;m 5 and can&#39;t <br/>
sit out in the car alone.  It&#39;s scary, and I  can see my mom in the window and <br/>
she won&#39;t come out to me.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s not something I want my child to feel.<br/>
