<div id="ygrps-yiv-975396033">Hi  Tia (waving)<br/>
<br/>
Guess that&#39;s three holes in the ground you&#39;ve got there now... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone else.  Things seem quiet on the list, so I&#39;ll jump in.   I&#39;m<br/>
Robin Bentley from White Rock, British Columbia.  Dd is Michelle, 7 3/4 yo<br/>
(she insists on the 3/4 part!) and dh is Ross.  We&#39;re both 46.  Dh travels<br/>
in the US alot; I hope to get to meet some folks on this list, when we<br/>
accompany him.  We&#39;ll be in Orlando and Daytona Beach FL at the end of<br/>
January, if anyone is nearby.<br/>
<br/>
As my first request, I would like to join the Alan Rickman fan club (&quot;Truly,<br/>
Madly, Deeply&quot; was my first encounter - sigh.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to know if anyone on the list is in the Seattle area.  There<br/>
is a possibility in the middling future of us moving there and I&#39;d like to<br/>
ask some questions (off list) about dealing with the state regulators. I<br/>
have read the information about WA&#39;s regs on the HEM website, but would<br/>
appreciate some additional &quot;real life&quot; experience.  In the meantime, we<br/>
spend time each month around the Woodinville/Bellevue area and would love to<br/>
have another family(ies) to join us at Science Centre or zoo or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll sign my messages with &quot;Robin B.&quot; as there seems to be an abundance of<br/>
Robins and Robyns from all over the place on this list.   I rather like that<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks, Tia, for inviting me - I&#39;ve learned so much from reading here.<br/>
<br/>
Robin B.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We love it here (but then, I&#39;m an Oregon native, so it&#39;s a homecoming <br/>
of sorts). No traffic, more sun, we get to bicycle everywhere. <br/>
Homeschooling laws are much less restrictive here too, I think. We <br/>
have a great homeschooling group and tons of unschoolers to do things <br/>
with. <br/>
<br/>
My kids were too young when we lived in Woodinville for me to look <br/>
into groups in that area, so I don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like up <br/>
there for finding like-minded unschoolers. All the folks I know from <br/>
there that were planning on homeschooling ended up choosing school, <br/>
for one reason or another. I do miss the 4 acres we had up there <br/>
though, and all the lakes! Cottage Lake park was our little summer <br/>
hangout, and Farrell McWhirter park with the animals and the trails <br/>
through the woods. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308835761">Hey Robin,<br/>
<br/>
Apologies for the late response...never have the time to read anything in a <br/>
timely fashion unless it&#39;s directly connected to my family like bills or <br/>
doctor appointments, girl scout field trips, etc.  We do live in the <br/>
Seattle area. Bothell, to be exact, which is just north of Woodinville and <br/>
Bellevue.  I have a 14 yr old son and a 10 yr old daughter.  Husband&#39;s a <br/>
pilot, so I&#39;m a single mom much of the time.  We would be more than happy <br/>
to be your contact in the area and help out in any way.  Feel free to <br/>
contact me at my email address direct or call (425) 398-1300/ <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cvw@...">cvw@...</a><br/>
