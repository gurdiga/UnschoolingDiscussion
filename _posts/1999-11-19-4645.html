<div id="ygrps-yiv-881942257">Well, I&#39;m having typical unschooling doubts - this time about math.  I just<br/>
spent a few days with a friend who has a 17yob that she unschooled. She&#39;s now<br/>
using more of a traditional curriculum with her 9yog, in part because her dd<br/>
prefers that learning style.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, she never really pushed math with her son, and to this day he has<br/>
difficulty with basic calculations.  He can do it, but without the immediate<br/>
resource of memorized math facts, he&#39;s quite slow at it.<br/>
<br/>
My 9yo dd was born to be unschooled.  She&#39;s a &quot;flower child&quot; - a dreamer, <br/>
gifted, with some ADD tendencies.  She likes math, but has little desire to<br/>
sit down and do worksheets.  We have lots of math software which she does once<br/>
in a while... I also have printed out blank times tables for her to fill in.<br/>
I have math wrap-ups, cuisenaire rods, and board games that include math. She<br/>
does them sometimes, but not regularly.<br/>
<br/>
She used a vtech computer game to teach herself pre-algebra last year... she can<br/>
figure it out, but it takes time because she doesn&#39;t have her times tables and<br/>
basic math facts memorized.  She also puts up a wall when I try and show her<br/>
something... at lunch the other day, she asked what 23 divided by 4 was. When<br/>
I told her 5, with 3 left over, she put on a face and asked what 3 left over<br/>
meant. When I first illustrated it, she pouted and said she didn&#39;t understand<br/>
(she wasn&#39;t trying). I tried to illustrate it again in a different way, and <br/>
this time she listened and understood immediately.<br/>
<br/>
SO do I let unschooling run its course, keep introducing math as we go in <br/>
various ways (computer, board games, manipulatives, etc.), and figure she&#39;ll<br/>
pick up what she needs when she needs it...<br/>
<br/>
OR do I agree with my friend, who, if she had to do it over again with her<br/>
unschooled son, said she would definitely have unschooled everything EXCEPT<br/>
math because it&#39;s something you need constant reiteration on for basic facts,<br/>
and there are many advanced principles (geometry, fractions, algebra, etc.)<br/>
that need &quot;book time,&quot; where you sit down and teach them math just about once<br/>
every day....?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for everyone&#39;s help with this!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706929743"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; am doing repetition of problems, and I even find that with this, if we work <br/>
&gt; the problems 3 days a week, then don&#39;t do it for a week, the next time I give <br/>
&gt; him the problem, he doesn&#39;t know how<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ve voiced my biggest concern .  When <br/>
kids acquire their math knowledge this way, I&#39;m not sure they  really learn <br/>
it.  I have homeschooler&#39;s math anxiety as bad as the next guy,  but <br/>
I know that doing Saxon (in our early homeschooling days) only turned <br/>
my math lover into a math dreader.  And........like you <br/>
said.......he&#39;d forget it unless there was constant repetition.   I <br/>
decided if he was going to forget it anyway,  why waste our precious <br/>
time hammering away at it.   If he needs to review computation for <br/>
the ACT or SAT,  we can review then and go for it.   See......without <br/>
this drill,  he gets the bigger picture- real math - not computation. <br/>
When I was younger,  I could compute and because of that I was in the <br/>
gifted math programs.  But I didn&#39;t GET it.   He loves  physics,  <br/>
astro-physics,  the concept of time in space,  geometry.  Granted he <br/>
doesn&#39;t tackle these in a nice orderly fashion which would overwhelm <br/>
me with joy,  but he really gets what he needs and moves way beyond <br/>
my understanding of math.  I&#39;d love to have the assurance that what <br/>
I&#39;m doing is absolutely right,  but no one can give me that.  I just <br/>
know that I&#39;d hate to ruin where he is now by intruding on his <br/>
learning with repetition and drills.  Just my $.02.<br/>

I know exactly the quandary you are in, I am there myself.  I think I am <br/>
going with the friend!  I believe that the base line needs to be taught, that <br/>
is providing the child with the resource that they need, then they can figure <br/>
out, and do what they want with the higher forms of math when they are ready. <br/>
 My two cents anyway! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782514976">You need it? If someone hates to do something and is compelled to by someone<br/>
else ....What does that mean? How does it feel?  I remember vividly.  I even<br/>
remember some of the things I learned in that context.  I actually don&#39;t<br/>
remember a single mathematical thing I was compelled to learn.  I still have<br/>
trouble with 8 +5.  Verbal stuff I remember but being compelled wasn&#39;t an asset<br/>
in the process of learning it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41805329">What makes her think that if she had drilled him he would be any better?  Maybe he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like math, finds it really disagreeable to his brain and want to live his<br/>
life around this minor obstacle.  He should carry a calculator and will have less<br/>
trouble with basic calculations. If it is important enough to him and he is able, he<br/>
will learn the basic number facts when he needs them.  If it isn&#39;t he won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And yes I can easily imagine children blaming their parents because they don&#39;t know<br/>
something and wish their parent had &quot;made&quot; them do it.  I say &quot;Sorry you feel that<br/>
way but it is your life and I was not willing to force you to do things that you<br/>
clearly did not want to do in the area of learning and thinking. It is your<br/>
responsibility which sometimes is wonderful and exciting challenge and other times a<br/>
scary and difficult challenge.  That&#39;s the way life is.<br/>

    But Joel, I value your opinions. My ds wants to be a geologist. he is <br/>
into all of the aspects, but has not gotten the idea of the need for <br/>
mathematics. He loves rocks soil and is happiest when searching for answers <br/>
to the ?? Where oil comes from, how geodes are formed, etc. I felt compelled <br/>
to have him progress on the mathematical side. I can say that when we are <br/>
measuring stalagmites, he will definitely get involved, and sit there <br/>
figuring out the diameter and everything *without the book*.<br/>
    Is this where I say, &quot;Shoot, I missed it, he is doing Math&quot;? I just now <br/>
thought about that, and the idea that he is in 4th grade, and we are not near <br/>

Saxon math.  For math, I&#39;ve bought the kidlets games (board, card, video<br/>
and computer) which they have &quot;fun&quot; with.  Math should be fun (like the 9<br/>
times and fun ways to remember them) and if it isn&#39;t you will only succeed<br/>
in making a math phobic kid.  There are also several &quot;fun&quot; math site that I<br/>
will look up and send.  The kidlets didn&#39;t even realise they were doing<br/>
math until they (the older ones) decided to look at some books on getting<br/>
into college and sample tests for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549594003">I used to think that people who could not add fast were &quot;slow&quot;. I used<br/>
to think the kid who sat next to me doodling all day was wasting his<br/>
life. He is now a professional artist. I used to think the guy who<br/>
walked around the halls with his boombox and tapes was obsessed. He is<br/>
now in broadcasting. I used to have pity on &quot;Bob&quot; who had to repeat a<br/>
year because he flunked a basic math requirement. He is now a print<br/>
artist.<br/>
I used to think that if you did not learn your basic facts that life was<br/>
going to deal you a harsh blow in adulthood. These are all people who<br/>
the teachers turned their backs on to pay attention to the good students<br/>
(who weren&#39;t there to waste their time). My best friend was held back<br/>
because a teacher flunked her in p.e. class (she was overweight and he<br/>
didn&#39;t like her).  She is now a devoted teacher to special needs<br/>
children. Then of course, I have one of these children. She suffered<br/>
hours and hours of drill, review, special classes....all in the name of<br/>
basic math facts. They made her cry, they made her ashamed, they made<br/>
her ill....This is how we discovered unschooling. Yes, we have left Mr.<br/>
Saxon on the shelf... ordered all kinds of &quot;fun&quot; math related<br/>
books....baked 2 cakes this week...went yesterday morning to the vets,<br/>
she showed us how to measure the advantage for our small dogs by using<br/>
the larger available size saving us big $$$....went shopping last night<br/>
and figured how much her play checkbook, play money,and play cell<br/>
phone(she said she can&#39;t be a good business person without a cell phone)<br/>
would amount to...figured the tax (luckily is 7%, which is one she can<br/>
remember)....we play games...she uses a note pad and pencil to double<br/>
check herself. The point being, she is no longer ashamed to use her math<br/>
skills. She has made leaps and bounds in the last two years and loves<br/>
geometry. She can do complex problems better than basic math facts...I<br/>
think if we looked deep into our own society we would be surprised how<br/>
many people don&#39;t know their math facts...we are just good at thinking<br/>
that only a select few are in this boat....why does the IRS allow us to<br/>
let them figure our tax when it comes to the basic add/subtract...why is<br/>
the largest portion of checks I receive back for NSF is by the<br/>
&quot;educated&quot; folks....why is it that everyone runs to our local<br/>
&quot;we-sell-it-all-mart&quot; when they are actually the highest priced retailer<br/>
on any item that is not on the midway?<br/>
<br/>
I hope we don&#39;t base our childrens success in life on basic math<br/>
facts...I think it would be unfair to judge one on their math skill..I&#39;m<br/>
sure the young man has many other attributes...shame to let them be<br/>
overshadowed by default in the math category....it is hurtful and<br/>
emotionally draining for them. I&#39;m glad I have my friends from my school<br/>
days to remind me there&#39;s more to life than basic math facts and three<br/>
wonderful kids to show me what life is really about!<br/>

I am sorry that you don&#39;t remember what you were compelled to learn, however, <br/>
that is not true of everyone.  There are many things that I had to learn, and <br/>
quickly forgot, but basic math, reading and writing are not among them.  No, <br/>
I didn&#39;t like it, and yes I remember what it felt like.  But you what?  The <br/>
things that you need to know you remember, I can&#39;t name all the capitols of <br/>
the states, doubt I could name all the states, can&#39;t name all the presidents <br/>
in order, all the countries in the world, ect, ect.  But I know where to <br/>
look, it would take me a long time to find some of the information, but I <br/>
could find it.  In the grocery store or at the mall, I wouldn&#39;t have all that <br/>
time to figure out if I was paying the right amount, or if I got the right <br/>
change back.   What I mean to say is, there are times when you have time, and <br/>
there are times when you don&#39;t.  So, that is why it is important to me that <br/>
my children need to learn the basics.  I hope what I have said conveys what I <br/>

 learning with repetition and drills.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
Diane,<br/>
My ds, is the opposite, he isn&#39;t into physics, or the advanced stuff, but he <br/>
did like the Saxon math.  we skipped the drills, except for the times tables. <br/>
 Now, I wouldn&#39;t say that we beat it to death.  He is in 5th grade and still <br/>
working on 7 and 8s.  But we do the basics, if it is word problems or mouse <br/>
math.  The repetition that I was referring to was the fact that he needs to <br/>
do the same types of things.  Maybe that is wrong, and maybe, now that I <br/>
really think about it, I only really make them learn the times tables, the <br/>
rest we take or leave, as far as memorizing.  But, I do think I will go back <br/>
to Saxon, even if just as a reference book.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629373833">There are many things that I had to learn, and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; quickly forgot, but basic math, reading and writing are not among them.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t like it, and yes I remember what it felt like.  But you what?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; things that you need to know you remember,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s the point... and that if the children are not remembering<br/>
them, even with drill, it&#39;s because they do not yet need the facts.  It&#39;s<br/>
like asking a baby who is spending all their energy learning how to speak<br/>
our language to begin to learn how to sing.  They aren&#39;t ready to sing yet,<br/>
they have this talking thing to learn.  There are wonderful studies out<br/>
there that prove our anecdotal evidence that a child deep in the throes of<br/>
learning language is not working out mathematical issues, and that children<br/>
who are concentrating on math, are not spending much energy on<br/>
verbal/language skills.  Everything has it&#39;s season.<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as *progress*, much less steady progress, there is<br/>
only understanding.  The time we spend asking our children to think and work<br/>
on things we think are important *for the future* is time not spent on<br/>
material that has meaning for them now.  We do not know what we are short<br/>
circuiting my demanding drill time, drill that even the poster says leaves<br/>
the child in a heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
How much better off would that child be if he was allowed to move toward<br/>
math at his own rate, in his own time?<br/>
<br/>
To complicate matters, I&#39;m not advocating never mentioning math to our<br/>
children, or never showing them what *school math* looks like.  It&#39;s part of<br/>
my job to expose my children to the wider world and that includes math facts<br/>
and math books and *school math*.  I just don&#39;t place the save value that<br/>
society has placed on being able to whip out math facts.  I have made other<br/>
choices, choices that I think serve my children ,and society as a whole,<br/>
much better.  I have asked them to think critically about their needs and<br/>
then to take action in regard to those needs.<br/>
<br/>
My children are acting upon this choice, and I have learned to wait.  I&#39;m<br/>
not necessarily calm while I wait.... but I&#39;ve learning waiting is best.<br/>

<br/>
I do not think he would have never touched math, as I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>
possible, but there is a blending thing that must go on.  I surely wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have wanted him to spend years thinking he is stupid, that&#39;s worse than<br/>
forcing math to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a child that has spent 5 years eating, sleeping, breathing and<br/>
teaching karate.  She&#39;s never been late for work and she was never late for<br/>
class unless it was my fault. &lt;g&gt;  But there were two times that I *made*<br/>
her go to class. Once was very early on, she had missed some interpersonal<br/>
cues and embarrassed herself in class, she just didn&#39;t want to go in the<br/>
door the next day.  I did a fairly good job of being an authoritarian parent<br/>
that day.  The second time was after a car accident and hit hurt like all<br/>
get out to go to class.  This was not about KARATE, this was about HER.  She<br/>
did not have to go back in order to learn karate, there were tons of other<br/>
options available, this was about her own personal growth, her own strength<br/>
of character.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard thing we do sometimes, this unschooling/parenting thing. It&#39;s<br/>
good we&#39;re human, we don&#39;t have to do it perfectly.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Stephanie, how old is your son?  As a math nut, let me say that I despise<br/>
 Saxon math.  For math, I&#39;ve bought the kidlets games (board, card, video<br/>
 and computer) which they have &quot;fun&quot; with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    Ds is close to 10. He likes Saxon, but some things he doesn&#39;t catch right <br/>
off. We are Dice fanatics, and whenever we are waiting, we make a point of <br/>
playing with them. The doctor is probably thinking that I am bringing up <br/>
gamblers! The girls have to count their die, but the older one is also <br/>
learning how to add the numbers together. With ds, we can vary it a bit. <br/>
Using the die, I can have him multiply, add, etc. <br/>
    What kinds of games do you have? I am thinking of giving him a notebook <br/>
and 100.00 at the top, and having him tally the bill as we shop....<br/>

me. Both from my memory of school and the things I witnessed with my own kids.<br/>
    When my 11yro was in 2nd and 3rd grade he always wanted to be super <br/>
scholar. He worked so hard and it hit me so forcefully how unfair all of this <br/>
stars and stickers and awards stuff can be. Not that awards should never be <br/>
given, but here my son was trying his little heart out. There were things he <br/>
just could not grasp yet. He was trying far harder than those it came <br/>
naturally to yet he could not get the award. How agonizing, couldn&#39;t anyone <br/>
but me see what a set up for giving up this was. They had other little <br/>
gimmicky awards but all the kids knew which were the &quot;important&quot; rewards.  <br/>

Gosh, you really did have a horrible time in school.  I guess I was lucky, <br/>
nothing like that ever happened in any of my classes.  My drills came at <br/>
home, my dad was the one that demanded the times tables and did the flash <br/>
card thing.  To this day I hate flash cards.  We do the &quot;multiplication <br/>
chant&quot; in the van when we are going to and from.......where ever.  Then we <br/>
see how good we are with one of the math mouse games.  Same game, different <br/>
rules!  LOL.  Anyway, I am sorry about your bad experiences, and those of <br/>
your class mates, as with everything in life, our views come from our <br/>
experiences, and each person comes equipped with his or her own individual <br/>
set.  I am sure that you are making sure that your children never go through <br/>
that kind of situation, and I wouldn&#39;t put mine through it either.  I am sure <br/>
that I didn&#39;t make myself clear in the first post, about Saxon.  I love <br/>
Saxon, hated the repetition, but love the way it builds gradually, and refers <br/>
back on itself.  Also, my ds likes the program, but not the timed things, so <br/>
we don&#39;t do those either.  Really, I am not a horrible monster, just your <br/>
