<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896392308">Wow Lynda,  very powerful. &lt;&lt;chill bumps&gt;&gt;<br/>
I think I get in these phases when my sleep debt is racked up or I&#39;m beating<br/>
myself up for &quot;failing&quot; with the house,  in giving my children attention,<br/>
when I lose focus,  when I feel that I&#39;m spinning my wheels and the laundry<br/>
is mountaneous (there&#39;s a word for ya!)....when my gas tank is empty,  so to<br/>
speak.<br/>
Your stroy and perspective gives me the strength to keep going,  pull out<br/>
the ol&#39; &quot;This too shall pass&quot; mantra.....and just find some moments to enjoy<br/>
this wonderful life I have.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Here&#39;s what was written in a card we received on Christmas Day from one of<br/>
&gt; our &quot;adopted&quot; boys.  This kinda card makes it all worthwhile and makes the<br/>
&gt; self-doubts go away at least for a little while!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You two have given me<br/>
&gt;      what no one else can,<br/>
&gt; Respect and responsibility to<br/>
&gt;      be a young man.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You shone light on the darkness<br/>
&gt;      and opened my eyes,<br/>
&gt; To learn from my mistakes<br/>
&gt;      and go on with my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From drama with mama<br/>
&gt;      or trouble in court<br/>
&gt; You two would never stop<br/>
&gt;      givin me support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I can&#39;t pay you back<br/>
&gt;      for all the good that you&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; But I recognize the family<br/>
&gt;      that loves me like a son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now when I speak,<br/>
&gt;      it&#39;s HONESTY before fear!<br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas and<br/>
&gt;      have a Happy New Year.<br/>
