<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504818534">Was surfing on the TV tonight, didn&#39;t feel like doing anything like cleaning <br/>
this dirty house. Came across the show Extreme Makeover on Fox. Did anyone <br/>
else see this? I am shocked that people would watch this let alone actually <br/>
subject themselves to the pain and suffering that is involved in the cosmetic <br/>
surgery these people endured, in the name of &quot;beauty&quot;, and feeling better about <br/>
themselves. I know what it is to not be a magazine cover, but do they really <br/>
believe that happiness comes from making the outside look &quot;better&quot; than before? <br/>
And the loved ones of these people, the husband saying&quot;It is like my wedding <br/>
night all over again&quot; Is this my imagination or is this exceptionally <br/>
shallow?If he loves  her shouldn&#39;t he have the hots for her whether or not she has a <br/>
tummy tuck or breast augmentation or nose job? <br/>
Forgive my rant. I need to get out more or something, I am really bothered by <br/>
this. <br/>
I don&#39;t want either of my children to feel they are anything but great, <br/>
regardless of how they look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732572596">I have been watching this show almost from the beginning of the season,<br/>
and I have to say that most of the people have been so truly miserable<br/>
because of some physical &quot;defect&quot; (in their view), that the external<br/>
change was nothing compared to how radiant, confident and happy they<br/>
became inside. People have sat in the dentist&#39;s chair crying because now<br/>
they feel they can smile if they want to. Repeatedly people talk about<br/>
how they always felt judged, and now their true joyous personality is<br/>
free to come out. And one of the things that comes up again and again,<br/>
is how their self image problems all started with cruel comments at<br/>
school.<br/>

affect things somewhat. How is it that some people with severe physical challenges <br/>
are still very happy with themselves? Yet, if you can ease someone&#39;s suffering <br/>
with such a change I suppose it could be worth it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess from that point of view it is valid. I just feel sad that personal <br/>
worth is wrapped up in appearance. I wish their souls weren&#39;t wounded by that in <br/>
the first place.As a very overweight person with a skin condition, I would <br/>
love to be fixed up, but I know that no matter the look on the outside, I am <br/>
still the same on the inside, and that for me, has had to come first as far as <br/>
work and repairs. It just seemed so shallow to me, I think I shall have to watch <br/>
an entire episode to form my opinion. Thanks for the food for thought.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I was very skeptical when this show first came on, but after having<br/>
watched it just about every week I can say that<br/>
(IMO) it&#39;s not at all about the new boobs.  These people truly come out<br/>
of their shells and feel that they can finally show their<br/>
face to the world and not be ashamed or afraid of being made fun of for<br/>
messed up teeth, a crooked nose, a flabby belly, a saggy chest, or<br/>
whatever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw a few shows quite awhile ago, I guess when they first started. Those<br/>
shows just seemed to be about liposuction, boob and nose jobs. It all seemed<br/>
very cosmetic and superficial. I did see another show awhile ago and that<br/>
one seemed more intent on actually haleping people who had been made fun of.<br/>
People who had features quite different from what is generally noticed as<br/>
acceptable. That show I liked. Haven&#39;t seen another since though so not sure<br/>
about last night. I was busy with kids, CMA awards and routing for Clay.<br/>
