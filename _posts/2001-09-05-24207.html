 I disagree with this point. I had an english grandmother that could say<br/>
 things like &quot;that&#39;s lovely, dear&quot; in a tone that made you feel like it was<br/>
 the worst thing you could have ever done. She was also adept at intense<br/>
 guilt trips. She hardly ever raised her voice or shouted. I often felt like<br/>
 I was an immense failure to her and often would avoid her company.<br/>

ruining our evening. She didn&#39;t ruin our evening her behavior ruined the <br/>
evening and it should be discussed I agree but there are times a parent like <br/>
myself and my background lose their cool and yell or snap. I do not however <br/>
blame. shame or call names. I also do not use adult &quot;tones&quot; on children. I <br/>
treat them as another human being nothing less.I do not subscribe to the <br/>
&quot;old&quot; children should be seen and not heard and a lot of tone in adults comes <br/>
from this mind set. I also despise it when another adult ignores a child when <br/>
they speak. We have a friend who does this, drives me batty. He didn&#39;t use to <br/>
until his gf came along w/ her child controlling issues. Now he trwats kids <br/>
differently. Bummer.</div>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&quot;stop being a brat&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 Now in our family, no one would think twice about that and no one would<br/>
 consider it name calling.  Our phrase is &quot;don&#39;t be such a jerk&quot; which<br/>
 translates into &quot;I really don&#39;t like what you are doing.  Could you please<br/>
 do it somewhere else?&quot;  It is kind of like dh can flip me off and I laugh<br/>
 but if somebody else did it, I would get mad.<br/>
 <br/>
 I don&#39;t think it really comes down to the words or the tone but the intent<br/>
 behind it, trying to hurt someone vs. expressing yourself.<br/>

background? Now when dd isn&#39;t in the room dh and I do use phrases we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
use w/ her. I do flip dh off he doesn&#39;t do that to me. He is a word person I <br/>
am a face and gesture person.I am so easy to read. DD inherited my gift for <br/>
faces. :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; As he&#39;s grown I&#39;ve learned that he is just more emotionally extreme than <br/>
my <br/>
 other boys. He&#39;s either extatic or furious, and can change in an instant. <br/>
 There is no simmering or cooling down period in his nature. Even his normal <br/>
 speaking voice is LOUD. We&#39;ve had to remind him to speak quietly, and in a <br/>
 few minutes he&#39;s yelling again.<br/>
 <br/>
 At least in some cases, I believe it is just nature.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sometimes it gets annoying... when he gets involved in a computer game at <br/>
2 in <br/>
 the morning and all you can hear (when I want to sleep) is the sound of boom-<br/>
 boom... and Sean giggling!!!  But I guess those are the nights I&#39;m not <br/>
sleeping <br/>
 that heavily anyway... oh well, this too shall pass.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  agree that there are many qualities that are just nature-----they are born<br/>
 that way.    I do think that if his normal speaking voice is also loud that <br/>
it<br/>
 would be a good idea to have his hearing evaluated.    One can have below<br/>
 &quot;normal&quot; hearing without being deaf and speaking loudly is indeed a symptom.<br/>

<br/>
   I have often thought of getting Zoe&#39;s hearing checked. Then she pipes up <br/>
about a subject dh and I were wispering about. She is just like our <br/>
dog,selective hearing. Runs in the highstrung catagory of animals I think. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
