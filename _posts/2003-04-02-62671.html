OK?? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What do you LIKE to do?<br/>
<br/>
If you like historical stuff, SC is packed. Seeing the east coast beaches <br/>
might be fun---watching the sun come UP for a change. Charleston (two hours <br/>
away) is a beautiful, historical, and exciting city. Savannah, GA is just <br/>
down the road from Charleston. The Blue Ridge Mountains are just two hours <br/>
north and and are a cool place to be in the heat of August. Myrtle Beach is a <br/>
famous and popular option, although no respectable South Carolinian would be <br/>
caught dead there! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the conference, you&#39;ll probably have a bunch of offers for <br/>
places to stay! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell me more of what you like. and I&#39;ll get some ideas together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, Myrtle Beach. My mother wanted the grandkids to go to Myrtle Beach with <br/>
her, she offered to pay for the hotel for a week. She thought I got pregnant <br/>
with my now almost 2yo son to get out of going-- i wish! So we went went my <br/>
son was only a month old. I spent most of the time in the hotel room with <br/>
him, where we could privately nurse in comfort. My kids did have fun, but I <br/>
am not the big vacation type. I have a pop-up camper, and vacation to me is <br/>
in the woods somewhere.  I mentioned this conference to her, knowing she <br/>
would want to go back to the beach. She could keep my smaller kids, <br/>
yanno.....LOL <br/>
<br/>
Well she is taking 2 weeks off in early august for either Alaska or Seattle, <br/>
so that ain&#39;t happening. So are there any great campsites in Columbia? <br/>
Preferably a cheap state park close by? Don&#39;t know I if can talk hubby into <br/>
dragging a camper from Ohio, but I&#39;m thinking......<br/>

Selling hotel rooms are how we &quot;pay for&quot; the ballrooms. But I&#39;d rather have <br/>
you there than not! &lt;g&gt; Google &quot;Sesquicentennial Park&quot; for camping info.<br/>
