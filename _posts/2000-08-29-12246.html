a pod person (a la Invasion of the Body Snatchers).  This is the man who <br/>
<br/>
three years ago told me that there would be no gaps in the education of his <br/>
<br/>
children, that it would be my job to research all the available curriculum <br/>
<br/>
packages, to choose the one that was the most rigorous and comprehensive, and <br/>
<br/>
that cost was no object.  Zack was 4, going on 5, at the time. &gt;&gt;<br/>

wait and see attitude.  First my dh needed to discover on his own that his <br/>
kids weren&#39;t going to be social and educational misfits.  Only then could he <br/>
make the jump to hyperspace (aka unschooling).  <br/>
