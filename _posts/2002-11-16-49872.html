<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291788657">Hi, I&#39;m new to the group and in our 2nd yr. hsing. I am wanting to <br/>
start unschooling. What I want to know is, if my dc want to work in a <br/>
math book does this count as unschooling? Yes, I know I will have to <br/>
resist the &quot;why don&#39;t ya&#39;ll work in your .....books a bit&quot;, but if <br/>
they come to me wanting to do work, shouldn&#39;t I help them w/ it?? For <br/>
example,I completely cut out all &quot;spelling drills&quot;, etc. for this yr. <br/>
and my oldest, wants me to give her spelling tests. I say okay, but <br/>
we always get caught up in other things and it&#39;s forgotten by the end <br/>
of the day.(Not on purpose, just living our lives) Is this the wrong <br/>
approach? Should I take time out to do this &quot;schoolish&quot; stuff w/ <br/>
them?? <br/>
I guess what I am afraid of is once I really let go, (and when I&#39;m <br/>
done w/ something, I&#39;m really done) that if they want this type of <br/>
learning I&#39;ll fall of the wagon and slip back to the &quot;school&quot; type <br/>
hsing. <br/>
Help, is there a Dear Abby out there for this question????<br/>
thanks<br/>

<br/>
I look at workbooks just like I do any other kind of book. If my kids want <br/>
to read it or &quot;do it&quot; then that&#39;s fine. I would never make my children do <br/>
workbooks any more than I would pick out a book I liked and &quot;make&quot; them read <br/>
it. My one daughter happens to love worksheets. She asks for them so I go to <br/>
the puter and find them for her. My son will ask for some occasionally too, <br/>
but not as much as her. Of course now she&#39;s on a no worksheet kick and <br/>
that&#39;s all fine by us. It&#39;s all child led, and if my child wants to do it, <br/>
then they do.<br/>

give me a spelling word.&quot; Make a game out of it.  She can look <br/>
through the dictionary trying to find a word that she really thinks <br/>
will trip you up.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but maybe look at it as you would helping an adult who couldn&#39;t get out<br/>
of the house on his own. Wouldn&#39;t you answer his questions and do some<br/>
activities he&#39;d like help with? You&#39;d have to help him get to things he<br/>
wanted, get books for him. The difference is you wouldn&#39;t have that little<br/>
voice in your head that kept pressuring you &quot;I have to get him to *this*<br/>
point in his understanding.&quot; So when you hear that voice urging you to get<br/>
your kids to some point that *you&#39;re* comfortable with, let go. Let *them*<br/>
determine the point they need to get to for now. Your job is to make sure<br/>
there&#39;s a variety of things running through their lives that they could<br/>
choose new interests from if they needed to.<br/>

<br/>
If they came to you with a coloring book, wanting help, would you help them?<br/>
<br/>
If they came to you with a maze book, or a puzzle book, would you help them?<br/>
<br/>
Would you press them to do the coloring pages or the maze JUST LIKE the <br/>
directions said?  Would you ask them each day if they had worked in that <br/>
coloring book, and would you press them to FINISH that coloring book?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;does this count as unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very soon you need to stop counting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is this going to be on the test?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Is this going to count?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those questions are from and of school.   Let them go.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For example,I completely cut out all &quot;spelling drills&quot;, etc. for this yr. <br/>
and my oldest, wants me to give her spelling tests.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For this year?<br/>
You might start spelling drills again &quot;next year&quot;?  Does next year begin in <br/>
January?  July?  August?  <br/>
<br/>
If your children believe that this unschooling is for one single year, they <br/>
will not behave or settle into it the same way they would if you treated each <br/>
day as today, a good day, a peaceful learning day.  If they see it as another <br/>
count-down day in &quot;this year,&quot; you won&#39;t get the results you want.<br/>
<br/>
-=- wants me to give her spelling tests. I say okay, but <br/>
we always get caught up in other things and it&#39;s forgotten by the end <br/>
of the day.(Not on purpose, just living our lives) Is this the wrong <br/>
approach? Should I take time out to do this &quot;schoolish&quot; stuff w/ <br/>
them?? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Who is to make the test list?  How about a piece of paper on the wall <br/>
somewhere, the refrigerator, the bathroom mirror, where anyone can add words <br/>
to the spelling list?<br/>
How about the wall right across from the toilet.  Everyone, resident or <br/>
visitor, will know the spelling words probably without a test.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess what I am afraid of is once I really let go, (and when I&#39;m <br/>
done w/ something, I&#39;m really done) that if they want this type of <br/>
learning I&#39;ll fall of the wagon and slip back to the &quot;school&quot; type <br/>
hsing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Either you really let go or you&#39;re in danger of relapse.  <br/>
Your danger of relapse will be smaller IF you really let go.  <br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;I have let go now&quot; isn&#39;t credible if you have one hand on the rope <br/>
and the other on a workbook.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Help, is there a Dear Abby out there for this question????-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  www.unschooling.com has lots of them.<br/>
