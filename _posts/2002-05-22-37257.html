<div id="ygrps-yiv-451332337"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I do have a question though...my children are all into the computer and <br/>
&gt;&gt;electronic games. I don&#39;t drive (soon though) so how do I get them away <br/>
&gt;&gt;from the computer games and the electronic stuff? I know that there is <br/>
&gt;&gt;learning in everything, but can you help me find it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would start by playing the computer and electronic games *with* them. Find <br/>
out what they are getting out of it. Talk to them about the characters, <br/>
strategies and such. Get into their world and be truly interested. Then they <br/>
may be more willing to get into your world and see what&#39;s interesting there. <br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
There are so many opportunities for things to do and learn together. What do <br/>
you like to do? Invite the kids to join you while you garden or bake or <br/>
build something or shop or take a walk. Talk to them about what you&#39;re doing <br/>
and why it interests you. Take time to notice the changes of spring. Wonder <br/>
out loud about why things happen the way they do. Look things up when you <br/>
don&#39;t know. Share your experiences with them. Visits to new places, museums, <br/>
old buildings, new shopping malls...they can all spark a new discussion. A <br/>
different observation. A meaningful connection for their internal model of <br/>
the universe.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Are my children going to get what they need?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! If you are with them and engaged and learning and asking and wondering <br/>
right along with them, they&#39;ll get what they need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Will they score high, even at grade level on standardized tests?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Maybe not. I try not to pay attention to what everyone else&#39;s kid is <br/>
learning or doing at any one particular moment. I try to get my kids what <br/>
*they* need to know at any particluar moment. That&#39;s not going to match all <br/>
the other kids in the world. FWIW I know my kids are ahead in some areas of <br/>
those standardized tests and behind in others. Just like they&#39;d be if they <br/>
were in school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How will I explain this one to my sister who is always wondering what I am <br/>
&gt;&gt;doing next?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Give her some books to read on the subject. Or send her here. We&#39;ll explain <br/>
it to her. ;-) Truth be told, the longer you do this, the more comfortable <br/>
you&#39;ll be in explaining it to others. In the beginning, you may want to <br/>
point them to the same books, papers and websites that have led you in this <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Should I run out and purchase books or something?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessary. But my family LOVES to read books. We go to the library <br/>
a lot. I get books on every topic and just strew them around to see if it <br/>
piques anyone&#39;s interest. There are books on crafts and science experiments <br/>
and animals. There are also cool videos and books on tape.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t see where the learning is coming in when we are sitting around the <br/>
&gt;&gt;house all day long and there is basically nothing in our neighborhood but <br/>
&gt;&gt;the cars that pass our street.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about those cars? What kind are they? What year? What else happened in <br/>
that year, what was life like then? Where were they manufactured? Where in <br/>
the world is that? What else is in that city? How does a car move anyway? <br/>
What&#39;s a combustible engine? Who thought it up? How do people think up such <br/>
cool ideas? Who were some of the great inventors of our time? Of all time?<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m not saying you should actually try to create a unit study on cars or <br/>
the questions I just threw out here. I am trying to point out, though, that <br/>
a big part of unschooling is getting yourself to think about the world in a <br/>
different light. Think about what is, how it got there, what it&#39;s connected <br/>
to and share those thoughts with your children. When they ask those <br/>
connecting kinds of questions, help them to find as much of the answer as <br/>
they need at that moment. Let them jump around from topic to topic. Let them <br/>
observe and be a part of everyday life. There&#39;s really so much to learn out <br/>
there. Enjoy it all.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846568525">Great input honey! I really appreciate this board and all that it has to <br/>
offer. I will be telling my friend about this board as she to is interested <br/>
in homeschooling/unschooling her son.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 oldest boys were attending the community college, my 13 year old still <br/>
is. My 12 year old decided that it is just not what he wanted to do. So, of <br/>
course I am not going to force him to do anything that he doesn&#39;t want to do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I am asking about the standard, as far as testing is <br/>
concerned, is because my 13 year old has already decided that he wants to <br/>
have an associates degree in computers before he turns 16. At first I thought <br/>
this was going to be very hard for him. I started off by letting him take a <br/>
piano class, which he loved...and a math class, basic...and he did really <br/>
well. I saw him dive into the math books and practice the piano and do what <br/>
he needed to do to get the job done. His motivated by his aunt who is <br/>
graduating today from the community college with 5 AA degrees. she has <br/>
transferred to Sac State as a senior. This has motivated my oldest so much. <br/>
He wants to be a doctor just like her. The good thing is that he puts his <br/>
mind to doing something and there is no turning back. My problem is, I don&#39;t <br/>
want him to be overwhelmed in this college thing. So, I am letting him decide <br/>
if it is too much. Of course I am looking at the changes that he is going <br/>
through, just to monitor everything myself.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that this is too much for him? Of course the ultimate decision <br/>
is mine and his to make, I am just looking for some advice.<br/>
<br/>
