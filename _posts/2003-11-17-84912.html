Interesting website -- here is something from it:<br/>
Ways to Learn<br/>
	� 	Learn by being told -- through lessons, lectures, presentations.<br/>
	� 	Learn by being shown -- from examples, demonstrations, and models.<br/>
	� 	Learn from an on-line or distance education course.<br/>
	� 	Learn by observing intensely.<br/>
	� 	Learn by studying books or other print resources.<br/>
	� 	Learn by asking someone what you want to know.<br/>
	� 	Learn by searching the Internet.<br/>
	� 	Learn by imitating a skilled performance.<br/>
	� 	Learn by practicing repeatedly, especially coached practice.<br/>
	� 	Learn by mentally rehearsing.<br/>
	� 	Learn by seeking direct experiences.<br/>
	� 	Learn by conducting an experiment.<br/>
	� 	Learn by taking action in the field, by doing it.<br/>
	� 	Learn by working cooperatively with others as a team.<br/>
	� 	Learn by teaching someone else.<br/>
	� 	Learn by teaching yourself.<br/>
	� 	Learn by studying media: videos, CDs, tapes, and DVDs.<br/>
	� 	Learn by preparing a public presentation.<br/>
	� 	Learn by working or studying with a mentor.<br/>
	� 	Learn by trial and error.<br/>
	� 	Learn by dramatization, by acting it out.<br/>
	� 	Learn by grouping, categorizing, and clarifying.<br/>
	� 	Learn by forming concepts based on evidence and reason.<br/>
	� 	Learn by creating conceptual maps of relationships among items or <br/>
ideas.<br/>
	� 	Learn by picturing -- by seeing and recalling things that are.<br/>
	� 	Learn by visualizing -- by imagining things that might be.<br/>
	� 	Learn by thinking metaphorically: link the known to the unknown.<br/>
	� 	Learn about ideas by connecting them to what you already know.<br/>
	� 	Learn from failure how not to fail; from success, how to succeed.<br/>
	� 	Learn from simulations.<br/>
	� 	Learn by taking a job that requires the performance you seek.<br/>
	� 	Learn by thinking for yourself -- forming opinions, reaching <br/>
conclusions.<br/>
	� 	Learn intuitively: discover what you know instinctively.<br/>
	� 	Learn by competing with others.<br/>
	� 	Learn by playing spontaneously or in games.<br/>
	� 	Learn from observing yourself: your thoughts, emotions, and actions.<br/>
	� 	Learn by striving to achieve an ambitious goal.<br/>
	� 	Learn from reflection and contemplation in solitude.<br/>
	� 	Learn from travel -- new places, new people, new activities.<br/>
	� 	Learn by doing what has moral value (for example, helping others).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213685964">It is an interesting website, but still within the paradigm of getting an<br/>
education, rather than living life. I chuckled at the heading &quot;Teaching<br/>
Students to Think Independently&quot;. I guess the unstated subtitle is:<br/>
&quot;Unlearning the protocols of Schools&quot;. I think it might be hard work to<br/>
remove independent thinking from a child. Jayn is full of it. I started to<br/>
read the description of one of the schools and recalled our listmember&#39;s<br/>
recent visit to Sudbury. 27 &quot;expectations&quot; including &quot;basic skills&quot;. The<br/>
list of ways to learn is more fascinating to me than some of the other<br/>
stuff, but I will be doing more reading there.<br/>

You brought the best part. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As schools go, he&#39;s got a great model!   It was a little scary to see the <br/>
ratings chart, and understandable as he has a PhD and people are charging people <br/>
money to help their kids learn in that way.  And it&#39;s a good way.  But anytime <br/>
money is involved there seems to need to be accountability for the funds and <br/>
time and so kids&#39; successes are measured and rated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d way rather go to a school like that than the one down the street, though.<br/>
