<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767123953">***One of the easiest things for parents to do is to do what their parents did, <br/>
or what their neighbors are doing, without really thinking much.  There are <br/>
magazines to reinforce that.  They can just dress their kids like mannequins <br/>
at Mervyn&#39;s and send them to the nearest school and buy them the recommended <br/>
Christmas gifts and slide right on through to the graduations and weddings.***<br/>

Sandra, you summed that up so well.<br/>
I have a friend (a good friend, met at La Leche League) who, after nursing her babies a good long time somehow fell right back into step with the rest of mainstream America after they were weaned.  Her kids have perfect clothes, perfect toys in a perfect playroom, and spend their days in school and at the requisite after school activities.  One time she was telling me how much her son hated little league practice and I asked her why she signed him up if he didn&#39;t want to do it.  She actually looked confused and a little panicked before she admitted that it hadn&#39;t occured to her to ask him if he wanted to do it- she just signed him up when he became of age.  Little League is as much an automatic part of childhood as school is, apparently.<br/>

My middle son (age 7) is playing soccer for the first time this year.  When I mention to anyone that it&#39;s his first year they don&#39;t know what to make of it... the other kids have been playing since they were 4!  When I say &quot;well, he never wanted to play before now&quot; I actually get silence and blank looks.  It&#39;s threatening to many people to see other people (including children) think critically and make up their own minds rather than just doing the next thing layed out for them.<br/>
