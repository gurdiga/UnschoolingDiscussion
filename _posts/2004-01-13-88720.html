<div id="ygrps-yiv-991736719">Early Intervention came by today to set up Megan&#39;s program. They asked about our schedule, and I said we&#39;re very flexible. They were concerned about interrupting Sarah&#39;s homeschooling time, and I explained about unschooling and everything and they said &quot;Wow...that&#39;s ALOT of committment!&quot; I laughed and said &quot;I&#39;m actually doing MORE than when we were using a curriculum. Then it was easy to just follow the directions and assume things would be just fine, but it wasn&#39;t much better than sending her off to school. I&#39;d sit her down with a workbook and do something else. Now though, we&#39;re &quot;working&quot; together and playing together and life is much more like it should be.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
When I first said that we don&#39;t use a particular curriculum, set times for &quot;work&quot; or anything like that I noticed they glanced at each other like &quot;ok, she&#39;s a looney one&quot; or something. Well, they said &quot;So, how does that work?&quot; and I explained that we make lots of opportunities available (strewing), go to the library often, watch TV, etc. and just enjoy living. <br/>
 <br/>
They were impressed, and one of the ladies asked me to write down a couple of URLs for her to look into and she also wrote down a couple of book titles to read. <br/>

Why not?!<br/>

<br/>
I am glad it went well, and you were able to present a<br/>
great picture of unschooling to them in such a<br/>
positive way.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
