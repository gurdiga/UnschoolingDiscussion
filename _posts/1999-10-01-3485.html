 </span></blockquote>That is an interesting question.  It is the same as asking &quot;What is the<br/>
difference between being Buddhist and being Atheist, being Hindu and being<br/>
Athiest, being (Any religion) and being Atheist?&quot;  Atheism is the denial of<br/>
the existance of dieties or the existence of divine beings.  Coming from a<br/>
Christian perspective, one might take it to mean that if you are not<br/>
Christian or do not believe in the Christian version of God, then you are<br/>
nothing.  I will give you the benefit of the doubt however, and just assume<br/>
that you were confused as to the meaning of atheism.  <br/>
<br/>
Paganism is a religion, or I should say that the term refers to many<br/>
religions, with dieties, beliefs, traditions, holidays, symbols and<br/>
symbolism, a rich history and a thriving modern community.  Paganism can<br/>
refer to many things, including modern Druidism, revering the Norse Gods,<br/>
Voodooism, Shamanism, Native American traditions, Native African religions,<br/>
or any religious traditions that are stemming from ancient practices.<br/>
Christianity and it&#39;s offshoots are fairly new, when compared to so many<br/>
other of the world&#39;s religious traditions.  As I said, there are as many<br/>
ways to be Pagan as there are Pagans.  Pagans are often said to follow the<br/>
&quot;old religion&quot; or the &quot;old ways&quot; and many Pagans combine traditions and<br/>
practices based on where they live and who they are.<br/>
<br/>
Holidays would also vary based on what type of Paganism you were talking<br/>
about.  Many follow natural cycles of the moon, sun, stars, seasons, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
For us, Paganism means following the traditions of the old Celtic calendar<br/>
and a mix of European traditions, as well as elements which have meaning<br/>
for us here in this land.  We worship both the Goddess and God in equally<br/>
important roles.  Balance is a key factor, and reverence for the natural<br/>
world.  We respect the energy (life) in all things and in all beings.<br/>
Holidays for us are the eight Sabbats that mark the Wheel of the Year:  <br/>
<br/>
Imbolg (Candlemas) February 2nd: the Celebration of Lights in the Spring,<br/>
representing the strengthening spark of light beginning to pierce the gloom<br/>
of winter.  Also this holiday has a fertility aspect for the coming spring.<br/>
<br/>
The Spring Equinox March 21st: the celebration of the realization of<br/>
spring.  The Equinox, when night and day, light and darkness are equal is a<br/>
time to remember the place that both winter and summer, birth and death,<br/>
light and darkness, male and female aspects play in our life, (think<br/>
ying-yang from Asian tradition and you&#39;ll have the idea.)  It is a joyous<br/>
time full of new life as well as a reverent acknowlegment of the importance<br/>
of balance in our lives and in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Bealtaine (May Day, May Eve)April 30th: the beginning of summer, and<br/>
looking forward to the realization of the bounty of summer. Rekindling the<br/>
&quot;Bel-fire&quot; of summer (symbolized by lighting candles or a fire) honoring<br/>
house &quot;Lares&quot; or house icons/spirits/etc and in general celebrating the<br/>
newly fertile and renewing world.  Maypoles play into this celebration.   <br/>
<br/>
Midsummer (Summer Solstice) June 22nd: the time when the sun is at it&#39;s<br/>
greatest power, the longest day and shortest night of the year.  This is<br/>
the apex of light and warmth, and a celebration of abundance.  This is also<br/>
a time to remeber, in the warmth and abundance, that the days will be<br/>
successively shorter henceforth, so this is also the first herald of the<br/>
cold season (themes of balance are recurring in all the Sabbats.)<br/>
<br/>
Lughnasadh (Lammas) July 31st: a time of symbolic death and rebirth, the<br/>
first of the two Harvest celebrations.  This is the reverence and<br/>
acknowledgment of the harvest time, the bounty of spring and summer in<br/>
fuition.  Fertility and the fullness of life are celebrated.<br/>
<br/>
Autumn Equinox (Mabon) September 21st: like the Spring Equinox, this is the<br/>
time when Light and Dark are equal, so it is a time of balance.  The Spring<br/>
Equinox might be described in aspect as the athlete poised for action after<br/>
winter, while Autumn equinox might be described as rest after labor.  The<br/>
Harvest has been gathered in and is now complete.  It is a time of<br/>
thankfullness for the bounty of the warm months and rest and preperation<br/>
(mentally, spiritually, physically) for the leaner months ahead.  It is a<br/>
time for changing gears into cold season mode.<br/>
<br/>
Rounding out the calendar of the eight Sabbats are Samhain and Yule, which<br/>
I ppreviously described.<br/>

Thanks so much for all of your words and info.<br/>
I&#39;ve printed it out, and I&#39;m going to read it when I have some time to<br/>
concentrate.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting all the differences in us.<br/>
Last night my husband looked up Paganism in the dictionary.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
describe Paganism like this at all.  It essentially &quot;a person who has no<br/>
religion&quot;.  Maybe as a person who worships many gods?  Hmmmm.  I&#39;m going to<br/>
read your post, and then think some more.  An atheist being one who doesn&#39;t<br/>
believe in any god, I see a slight difference.<br/>
I do think most people just kind of &quot;move&quot; religion around to suit themselves.<br/>
Thanks for all your info.<br/>

difference between one who believes in no religion, and one who believes in<br/>
a non-Christian religion.  I would like to know what kind of a dictionary<br/>
you were using to look up Paganism.  Mine, American College Dictionary<br/>
printed in 1953, is by far not the newest edition on the block.  It<br/>
contains the following definitions:<br/>
<br/>
Paganism:  1) The pagan spirit or attitude in religious or moral questions.<br/>
 2) The beliefs or practices of pagans.  3) The state of being pagan.  end<br/>
<br/>
Pagan:  1) One of a people or community professing some other than the<br/>
Christian relligion (applied to Greeks, Romans, etc, and sometimes Jews.)<br/>
2) one who is not a Christian, Jew, or Mohammedan.  3) Pretaining to the<br/>
worship or worshipers of any religion which is neither Christian, Jewish,<br/>
nor Mohammedan.  4) Of pretaining to or characteristic of pagans.  end.<br/>

<br/>
This is not an uncommon misinterpretation.  The term &quot;Pagan&quot; is<br/>
*frequently* used by people who don&#39;t understand it, to mean &quot;heathen&quot;.  I<br/>
have to wonder if it is truly a misunderstanding, or something promoted by<br/>
someone with an agenda.<br/>

<br/>
(Not saying you have any agenda, but the makers of that dictionary might<br/>
well have)<br/>

I believe this is due to the term &quot;pagan&quot; meaning of the country and <br/>
&quot;heathen&quot; meaning of the hearth, both giving the impression of simple country <br/>
folk? I might be wrong, so I hope no one gets upset by my definition! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually Pagan refers to the original or &quot;old&quot; people of a land (or those<br/>
who hold beliefs in modern times which are thought of this way.)  So<br/>
essentially that part is correct.  However, the word &quot;heathen&quot; is derived<br/>
from &quot;of the heath&quot; not &quot;hearth&quot; and referred originally to the inhabitants<br/>
of the british isles who lived on the heaths, and was used by the Romans.<br/>
The word heathen evolved to mean savages, barbarians and uncivillised folk<br/>
and was spread by England in their many years as the greatest conquering<br/>
power in the world.  Your idea was sound however, as both refer to the<br/>
original occupants of a land, and have been used in a variety of ways with<br/>
meanings stemming from this.<br/>

I got out my dictionary, too, and one of their definitions for pagan included <br/>
the implication that it was more likely to be country folk.  I guess they <br/>
cling to the old ways when a new religion sweeps through the cities...<br/>
