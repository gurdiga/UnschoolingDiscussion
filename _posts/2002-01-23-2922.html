<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193124346">Ok.....long story short.  I found a lump in my breast the end of november, today I finally had a surgical consult and the surgeon( a lovely woman who pulls no punches) said she wants it out of there.  So, here I am waiting again(first it was to see the doctor, then to have the mammo/ultrasound, then to discuss results, then waiting 4 weeks to get in with the surgeon).  With each appointment, test or whatever, I psyched myself into thinking everything was fine, they would tell me it was nothing and I would be on my way.  Now, I have to wait for the call to tell me when surgery is, what the pathology result will be, yadda yadda.<br/>
<br/>
With the number of women on this list, I know I can&#39;t be the only one who has experienced something like this.  How do you keep yourself from thinking yourself into a:) a major depression or b:) convincing yourself you have cancer and worrying about the family.<br/>
<br/>
THEN, to top it all off.  Joe&#39;s mom called to see how my appointment went and she went for her annual gyn checkup yesterday and they found a lump in her and she has to have a surgical consult.  I feel so badly for my husband.  But, I also feel guilty for wondering why I can&#39;t have a dilemma without sharing it with someone(his mom is the type of person if you had diarrhea, she would have it 3 times as bad as you with purple polka dots).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for blabbing this all to the list, but I have spent my day holed up in my room and now I can&#39;t sleep.  I can&#39;t verbalize my feelings, but I can type them.  I just wondered if any of you had been in the same boat and how you kept yourselves sane.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800665527">Karen,<br/>
I have no experience with this kind of scare, but I wanted to say hello<br/>
tonight, and I&#39;m sorry for everything you&#39;re going through. <br/>
I was moved, but not surprised, that you&#39;re worried about your family. <br/>
That&#39;s kind of a safety device itself maybe, or at least a sign that<br/>
you&#39;re a good mom.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
That mom thing never stops, does it?<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;ve been through a lot lately.  Maybe you just need<br/>
time to recharge.   <br/>
I wish I could offer some advice about staying calm and centered.  I&#39;m<br/>
sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking of you.  Do you want me to stay up with you tonight?  We<br/>
could exchange mother in law stories.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Love&Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Karen, I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve been going through all of this. I wish I had a <br/>
magic wand to make this all go away. Waiting for the doctors to do their <br/>
thing is sooo hard.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talking to all of us will help a little with your sanity. You&#39;ve got <br/>
lots of support here. (as I&#39;m sure you do IRL) Please post and talk and vent <br/>
as much as you need to.<br/>
<br/>
With all good thoughts being sent your way,<br/>

&gt; yourself you have cancer and worrying about the family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so sorry to hear this. When I was 27 I found a lump and my doctor<br/>
sent me to seea  cancer specialist because all the women in my family<br/>
have died of it. I had just given birth to my third child and had three<br/>
littlies under three.<br/>
In England you have to wait a while to see a specialist (the down-side<br/>
of a free national health service) so in the 4 months I read everything<br/>
I could that was alternative treatments. I changed my diet to an organic<br/>
vegan one, stopped coffee, ate plenty of fresh vegetables (yuck). It was<br/>
taking these positive steps for my own health that got me through the<br/>
waiting time.<br/>
When I finally saw the consultant (who was a idiot I might add) he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t examine me. &#39;Women under 50 don&#39;t get breast cancer&#39; he<br/>
announced and swept off. If I hadn&#39;t been nekkid I&#39;d of run after him<br/>
and floored him. Fortunately his registrar was a nice man who examined<br/>
me, said it was probably a fibroadenoma and sent me for an ultrasound<br/>
exam. This was another 3 months later.<br/>
During that time I became a Reiki practitioner and started to study<br/>
homeopathy.<br/>
It was a FA but what kept me going through those months, apart from my<br/>
kids was the positive way I took control of my own health, removed<br/>
anything from my body that would poison it, and prevent it&#39;s own healing<br/>
machanisms from working.<br/>
I did get depressed at times, especially with the long waits, not<br/>
because I&#39;m afriad of dying, but because I didn&#39;;t want to leave my<br/>
kids.<br/>
Anyway, I hope that things go well for you. You may feel up and down but<br/>
take control of what you can. Any illness can be a catalyst for change<br/>
whatever the outcome.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

50.  Another was under 50 when she first got it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322651475">Thank you everyone for the kind words and thoughts.  Things are better<br/>
today(at least at this moment &lt;g&gt;, the time before falling asleep is the<br/>
worst).  The surgery is scheduled for 2/4.  Being 33, I found that reading<br/>
up on everything they have told me so far is not helping me feel better.<br/>
The answers are either it&#39;s nothing, or it is something, and that something<br/>
is big.  So.....I choose to no longer research the topic &lt;g&gt;.  Whatever the<br/>
outcome, I will be glad to have an answer.  Shryley was right, this is<br/>
definitely an opportunity to take note and make changes.<br/>
