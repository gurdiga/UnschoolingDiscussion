<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015573272">I read all these posts with interest.  I have educated my daughter <br/>
for the last 6 months - before that she was in school, and I am <br/>
thinking how lucky i am that my husband lets us get on with it.  I <br/>
have no oppositon from him ............................ but then I <br/>
realized that I have never actually *told him* that we dont do school <br/>
any more!!!  I am not sure how he would take it........<br/>
He sees this happy confident independant helpful daughter, a GREAT <br/>
change from the sad argumentative child that she used to be, and <br/>
comments how good h/s is for her.<br/>
I think I might just leave it like that !!!!!<br/>
