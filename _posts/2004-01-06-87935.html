<div id="ygrps-yiv-738814493">I came across an article that fits the discussion we were having about <br/>
place names. There&#39;s a writer who has been making special maps of Canada <br/>
for a Vancouver magazine. She picks a theme and then looks for place names <br/>
that fit. She&#39;s working on a beer map now (Brewer Creek, Maltman Lake, <br/>
Barley Island, etc.). Other themes have been Erotic (Naked Man, Lust Lake, <br/>
Nymph Point, etc.) True Patriot Bugs (Parasite Creek, Crawling Valley, Buzz <br/>
Lake, Beeswax, Gaie Bug-in-a-rug, Flea Head, etc.) Meat (Muttonville, <br/>
Bloodletter, Thigh Hills, Tenderloin Mountain, etc.) Plumbing the Depths <br/>
(Worthless Creek, Lac Du Regret, Melancholy Mountain, etc.) and the <br/>
Menstrual Map (Port Moody, Leakville, Cramp Creek, Red Secret Point, Lac <br/>
Tampon, and Gush Cove, etc.) The feature is named Caught Mapping, and each <br/>
map usually includes around 150 place names that fit the theme.<br/>

online. &lt;g&gt; I wanted to see what some of the other place names would be.<br/>
