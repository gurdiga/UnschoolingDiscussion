&lt;&lt; <br/>
 When I speak about my Mother being good at frustrating children I mean she<br/>
 is an artist.  She has the art of working with young children and being able<br/>
 to help them just enough when they need help but not do everything for them.<br/>
 She is wonderful at creating an environment where they naturally want to do<br/>
 things like making calendar chains or alphabet pictures.  She is perfect at<br/>
 standing back and waiting for them to work stuff out on their own.  She<br/>
 understands the fine line between the frustration that is moving the child<br/>
 to attempt new things and the frustration where they give up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you see as frustration, I view as fascination.<br/>
It is fascination with an object or concept that makes learning possible, not <br/>
frustration. When frustration enters in, learning slows or stops. I think <br/>
seeing it as frustration is a very strange concept.<br/>
When a person is saying &quot;Wow, HOW does that work?&quot; a learning opportunity has <br/>
come around. Or &quot;HOW are you doing that?&quot;<br/>
There is a determination that can come, there are frustrating moments that <br/>
can happen, it is my job to help my kids gain skills to deal with those <br/>
naturally frustrating moments, not introduce them.<br/>
Allowing children the space to figure things out for themselve is simply <br/>
respect. Being available to help if needed, but not jumping in and doing it <br/>
for them prevents frustration actually.<br/>
Here is the dictionary term to avoid further confusion:<br/>
<br/>
1. To prevent from accimplishing a purpose or fulfilling a desire: thwart.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm? Doesn&#39;t sound like what your Mom did at all.<br/>
<br/>
2. Feelings of dissatisfaction caused by an inability to achieve personal <br/>
fulfillment.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so we can feel this while trying to learn something difficult. It happens <br/>
naturally, no need for anyone to try and make it happen. And again, something <br/>
that adults should help a child prevent and show them ways to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Frustrate: 3. to prevent the accomplishment or development of: nullify.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see where your choice of words is causing problems?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see what your mother did as frustrating them at all. I see letting <br/>
people do what they can as respectful. If she stopped them from accomplishing <br/>
what they wanted to, THAT would be frustration.<br/>

 this was a list that was well-versed in these concepts &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you deliberately try to misunderstand? Or am I now misunderstanding <br/>
your meaning again?<br/>
Understanding a word in different contexts is hugely different from using it <br/>
in a way opposite from how the dictionary defines it.<br/>
A list well-versed in the misuse of words? No, it isn&#39;t that. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
what you mean. I have taken child development courses, read numerous books on <br/>
the topic and gentle parenting courses. No where have I read about the role <br/>
of frustration in helping people learn.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Do *you* enjoy being frustrated and angry?  If I needed to lift something <br/>
heavy and couldn&#39;t quite manage it, should my much stronger husband stand by <br/>
and watch me- mabye even calmly tell me that frustration isn&#39;t something to <br/>
avoid?  Should he only help me if I get really really upset instead of just a <br/>
little bit upset?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Patti&#39;s questions here reminded me of last night.<br/>
<br/>
I was shopping with dh for groceries for the upcoming road trip to the <br/>
conference. I was reaching up high to try and pull out  a large pack of juice <br/>
boxes from the top shelf, I was getting frustrated because my fingers kept <br/>
slipping off but I didn&#39;t ask for help or act angry.<br/>
Dh saw me struggling to get them down and says &quot;here, let me get that for <br/>
you&quot;. Not because he didn&#39;t think I would eventually get them, but he could <br/>
do it easier. It was a kind gesture.<br/>
Should he just have stood there and watched me struggle? Until I asked for <br/>
help? Or should he offer it kindly, and be willing to back off if I said &quot;No <br/>
thanks, I want to do it myself&quot;.<br/>
I think the kind thing when you see someone getting frustrated or struggling <br/>
is to offer help. Maybe they really want to do it themselves, then they&#39;ll <br/>
tell you.<br/>
But I felt a lot of happiness that dh offered to help and didn&#39;t wait for me <br/>
to keep struggling.<br/>
Gestures of kindness.<br/>
How are you going to discern when your child really needs help if you think <br/>
you can tell without asking? You are claiming to know a real cry from a not <br/>
needy one. How? You can&#39;t feel what that person is feeling. I assume that my <br/>
child needs something when they cry.<br/>
I assume they need some assistance when frustrated.<br/>
If I&#39;ve assumed wrong, there is no harm done because they will let me know <br/>
that I am not needed at that particular point.<br/>
But if I withhold my help, they will learn that I&#39;m not to be trusted.<br/>

I agree.  When I wrote my post I wasn&#39;t thinking of someone who doesn&#39;t *want* help... like if my toddler was saying &quot;I&#39;ll do it myself&quot; about putting his clothes on I certainly wouldn&#39;t insist on helping him.

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading these posts and have to agree with Ren&#39;s line of thinking. <br/>
(don&#39;t get a big head Ren!) I think we all at some time or another feel <br/>
frustration. I don&#39;t think it feels good or is absolutely necessary for us <br/>
to learn something. I think it is important when one sees it to offer any <br/>
help or suggestions and like Ren said, no when to back off is that person <br/>
wants to do it themselves. My daughter will take an offer of help readily, <br/>
my son wants to be left to his own devices. With him, I don&#39;t see it as <br/>
frustration as much as determination. I always offer, and once in awhile he <br/>
will let me suggest or help. That may ver well be when he IS getting <br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as a baby crying, I think all cries need to be attended to. A <br/>
little squirming or fussing when a baby is trying to settle down is one <br/>
thing, as someone else mentioned. Crying is another. We always had a saying <br/>
around here when the kids were little. &quot;No crying babies in this house.&quot; <br/>
That meant we did whatever we could to comfort to make the crying go away. <br/>
It worked and our kids are better because of it. I don&#39;t how many times I <br/>
had been reprimanded by &#39;well meaning&#39; people? who said to them let them cry <br/>
it out. How terrrible.<br/>

they can already do for themselves, I don&#39;t rush to get there, but perhaps I<br/>

did it on their own.<br/>
<br/>
As for the example of the husband watching the wife lift something heavy, or<br/>
whatever it was, unlike our children we tend to get weaker with the passage<br/>
of time, so what may be a kindness in one situation could be cruel in<br/>
another.  Like the story of the candle and the pot of soup.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that the kids feel manipulated or controlled.  I think that<br/>
they just think I am kinda slow.  I have been trying to think of examples of<br/>
how I frustrate and this makes it seem more pre-meditative than it is.  I<br/>
often notice that I do these kinds of things when I see other parents doing<br/>
things where I know I would have hung back.  My kids are probably used to me<br/>
hanging back and know that that is just how I am.  I guess they are used to<br/>
having such a frustrating Mother and don&#39;t even know they have one.<br/>
<br/>
As for the dictionary definition (not that a dictionary is the only arbiter<br/>
of meaning), I thougth number two was closest to how I am using the word.<br/>
What could be more motivating in a healthy person than feeling dissatisfied<br/>
with one&#39;s inability to achieve personal fulfillment?  If you are satisfied<br/>
that you have already achieved fulfillment then what is there left to learn?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do it from instinct.  We all have a certain level of control over our<br/>
children.  We have dis-proportionate impact on their environment, we are the<br/>
providers of resources.  Our skills are the beginning of what we can pass on<br/>
to our children.  We are always to a certain extent actively involved with<br/>
our kids.  We are never truly nuetral.  Even the parent who responds<br/>
immediately to a request for help has an agenda.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult needed my help they probably would wait until they saw that I<br/>
had finished the dishes to ask.  Children see the world differently and may<br/>
ask for help at any time.  So perhaps the immediate response is the<br/>
premeditated one.  Perhaps because a parent has been influenced by<br/>
discussion groups where people say things like, &#39;oh making children wait<br/>
when you could help immediately is cruel and dishonest&#39;.  So they consiously<br/>
try and respond immediately.  How natural is that?  Who knows what is<br/>
natural.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have certain advantages over others though.  My development since<br/>
birth has been for the most part self-regulated.  My parents did not force<br/>
me to learn things on schedule, we played most of the time and spent perhaps<br/>
an hour per month on what people would call &#39;academic&#39; persuits.  As<br/>
children our parents trusted that our instincts were good.  Now as an adult<br/>
I still think my instincts are pretty sound.  That is the whole point of<br/>
unschooling, the child&#39;s natural intelligence remains in place rather than<br/>
crushing it out of them with brainwashing techniques.  Of course this<br/>
doesn&#39;t make me a perfect mother.  I just approach things differently.<br/>

Anthropologists have a much better view of it than religion-based advisors <br/>

When a baby cries and a mother picks it up, she is acting on instinct.<br/>
When a baby cries and she looks at the clock, that&#39;s not as natural.<br/>

<br/>
No, I think the baby is interested in getting that ball into her mouth and<br/>
then she finds that her body is not getting over to it so she gets<br/>
frustrated and kicks her legs and then figures out how to crawl.  And when<br/>
crawling becomes frustrating because she can&#39;t go fast enough then, after<br/>
enough frustration, she learns how to walk.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that children learn to talk because they are interested in<br/>
talking.  I think that they find that not being able to talk can be a<br/>
frustrating experience so they figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
When people first begin to learn about homeschooling they do so not because<br/>
they are interested in homeschooling but because the alternatives to<br/>
homeschooling are so frustratingly poor.<br/>
<br/>
Even the idea that people learn because they are passionate about something<br/>
is putting the cart before the horse, they become passionate about what they<br/>
have already learnt, it isn&#39;t passion that leads them to seek further but<br/>
frustration that what they already know isn&#39;t enough.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I am being ridiculous.  Passion, interest and frustration all play<br/>
a role in learning.  I am just exagerating one side to make a point.<br/>

Even the parent who responds<br/>
immediately to a request for help has an agenda.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;agenda&quot; in responding as immediately as I reasonably can is that I enjoy<br/>
living in a family of people who want to help each other achieve happiness<br/>
and contentment.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;reward&quot; for this is two children who, if I ask for help, almost always<br/>
respond immediately to my request (and on those occasions when they do not,<br/>
it&#39;s for a good reason, such as being right in the middle of something<br/>
important to them to continue with).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
If an adult needed my help they probably would wait until they saw that I<br/>
had finished the dishes to ask.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
There are degrees to things. If my husband is spouting blood from a major<br/>
artery, I don&#39;t say, &quot;Yes, yes, I&#39;ll help you when I&#39;m done with the<br/>
dishes.&quot; If he wants me to come look at a web page, he&#39;ll say, &quot;When you<br/>
have a chance, will you come look at this?&quot; My language to my daughters when<br/>
they say &quot;Will you make me some chocolate milk?&quot; and I&#39;m right in the middle<br/>
of something, reflects this kind of asking, &quot;I&#39;m right in the middle of the<br/>
dishes, can you wait for a few minutes while I finish?&quot; (And if their answer<br/>
is no, they can&#39;t wait, then the dishes can.)<br/>
<br/>
This has resulted in two children, age 7 and 5-yesterday, who very often now<br/>
and will more and more as time goes on, ask for non-urgent things by saying,<br/>
&quot;When you&#39;re done with the dishes, will you make me some chocolate milk?&quot;<br/>
(And it has not hindered their ability or desire to learn and do things<br/>
themselves as they are ready to try them, including making their own<br/>
chocolate milk some of the time).<br/>
<br/>
My point remains that I don&#39;t believe intentionally frustrating children for<br/>
the purpose of pushing them to &quot;do things themselves&quot; is necessary or<br/>
beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
My agenda is to be helpful, polite, kind, and accomating to the people I<br/>
live with. This results in them being helpful, polite, kind and accomodating<br/>
toward me. If I were &quot;setting them up&quot; and intentionally withholding<br/>
something they were asking for because I wanted to intentionally frustrate<br/>
them into doing it themselves, it would not help my family live more happily<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
That is the whole point of<br/>
unschooling, the child&#39;s natural intelligence remains in place rather than<br/>
crushing it out of them with brainwashing techniques.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the whole point of unschooling for our family. It&#39;s not even a<br/>
main point for us.<br/>

<br/>
As for the idea that learning is interest driven.  I just can&#39;t picture a<br/>
baby sitting back and saying &#39;Hey, that thing they do with two legs looks<br/>
interesting.  Maybe I will try and learn it too because I am interested in<br/>
it.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
No, I think the baby is interested in getting that ball into her mouth and<br/>
then she finds that her body is not getting over to it so she gets<br/>
frustrated and kicks her legs and then figures out how to crawl.  And when<br/>
crawling becomes frustrating because she can&#39;t go fast enough then, after<br/>
enough frustration, she learns how to walk.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Point 1: Neither of my children showed any interest in learning to walk for<br/>
the purpose of getting &quot;to&quot; something. Both went through all steps of<br/>
walking with the obvious purpose of the walking itself. Once they could<br/>
walk, they&#39;d walk all over randomly for several days before they even<br/>
considered walking from point A to point B *for* something. (Exception, we<br/>
did the typical parent game of letting baby walk from one parent to the<br/>
other for applause and hugs, but that was our idea, not the baby&#39;s, though<br/>
they entered into it willingly once it was suggested).<br/>
<br/>
Point 2: Even if &quot;getting to something&quot; had been my child&#39;s motivation to<br/>
walk, that&#39;s a natural frustration. That&#39;s not me putting obstacles in their<br/>
way, moving the toy intentionally out of reach or refusing to hand the baby<br/>
the toy when she asks, all with the goal to &quot;push&quot; her to something on my<br/>
timetable instead of hers.<br/>

hungry, hurt, lonely or needing anything I could provide.<br/>
My agenda is to raise children as free from fear as is humanly possible, to <br/>
have their needs so fulfilled, to have them so content that they are <br/>
overflowing with love for their fellow humans and confidence in themselves.<br/>
Do I always attain this agenda? No. I&#39;m not nearly good enough at it. I&#39;m <br/>
still deprogramming a life time of learned behaviors that seem quite <br/>
natural...and harmful.<br/>
But that is my agenda.<br/>

That isn&#39;t even remotely true.<br/>
I was interested in homeschooling simply because it compelled me. I began my <br/>
research only on interest.<br/>
I eventually saw the damage in school as counter to homeschooling, but that <br/>
wasn&#39;t what propelled me to learn about it. I started learning about it, <br/>
based on interest alone, before my son was school age though. So alternative <br/>
were not an issue in the beginning.<br/>

home as opposed to unschooling. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember who the original <br/>
poster was - Liz?<br/>
<br/>
I said in my introduction that we were unschooling before we even knew what <br/>
it was called.  I believe that unschooling is the natural outcome when you <br/>
are an intuitive parent.  We didn&#39;t expect our babies to eat when the clock <br/>
said they should, or walk when the books said they would, so why should we, <br/>
all of a sudden, just because they have turned five, expect them to learn <br/>
things because the Department of Education says they should?<br/>
<br/>
My seven-year-old does not tie shoes either (velcro only).  I&#39;m good at <br/>
shrugging my shoulders.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But what about kids like my oldest who avoid frustration? Who wait until<br/>
they are good and ready to do something and then do it practically <br/>
overnight? For whom frustration can be often be overwhelming? In my<br/>
son&#39;s case, frustration seems to be more of a hindrance then a help.<br/>
So yes, I try to help him avoid frustration...he gets so mad at himself<br/>
when he tries to write and the letters do not look good enough (for him,<br/>
not for me). We have talked about how practice will help him improve and<br/>
how things do not have to be perfect. But he still gets so mad at himself.<br/>
So I do not push it and I am sure that he most likely will pick it up <br/>
overnight. The way that he learns is to *watch*, not necessarily do. We have<br/>
a Lemmings computer game...he likes me to play while he watches. He has gradually<br/>
increased the levels that he will try on his own. This does not mean that he<br/>
will not try something on his own, just that if the frustration level gets too<br/>
high for him, he shuts down. So I guess that I see frustration as more of a hindrance<br/>
then a motivating factor.<br/>
<br/>
I have also been looking at why I learn things and sometimes it is because I get<br/>
frustrated and want a better way, but most times it is more from a desire to learn<br/>
more about the subject. I started looking into hsing because I met some folks online<br/>
who talked about it and it seemed like a really neat way to learn. Before meeting<br/>
them I would have been perfectly fine sending Jason to school. I loved it myself.<br/>
After reading and thinking more about it, I realized that learning from life was just a <br/>
cool way to learn. There have been lots of things that I have learned in my life that<br/>
were easy to learn and did not involve frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is just the connotation of the word for me. I see frustration like the dictionary<br/>
definition as a negative. Learning for me is not a negative thing. It is born out of a <br/>
desire to learn more. If it is something challenging, there may be frustration involved,<br/>
but I do not see that frustration is required in order to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely love American History. I find it fascinating. I am not frustrated by my<br/>
lack of knowledge, but if there is a pbs show that sounds interesting, I will watch it.<br/>
If I find a good book that sounds interesting I read it. Because it interests me. As<br/>
an aside...I was watching the pbs show Founding Fathers and I learned something that <br/>
fascinated me...when there was debate about whether to start a national bank, Hamilton<br/>
and Jefferson argued about whether to do so was constitutional (Hamilton for and Jefferson<br/>
against). I just thought that it was so neat to think that even the people who wrote<br/>
the constitution had debates over what was constitutional or not. Call me weird I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rambling...just still mulling over whether frustration is necessary for <br/>
learning...<br/>
