Now that I think about<br/>
it, I have no idea how I will explain the tests to our son next year. It<br/>
could end up being quite traumatic.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be. Just be honest. Tell him that he needs to take the<br/>
tests for reasons that you don&#39;t agree with but have to comply with. Tell<br/>
him to think of it as a game (or just imply it as kind of a game in general)<br/>
and not to worry if he doesn&#39;t get everything right. ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
