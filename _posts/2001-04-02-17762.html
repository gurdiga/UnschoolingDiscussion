be for at least $25 an hour or it&#39;s just not worth it. You have to figure<br/>
out for yourself how much money makes it &quot;worth it&quot; for you and your family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just recently paid off the last of our debts.... We are following a budget that includes monthly savings and we have figured into it about how much we spend a year on educational games, trips, etc., so that those things aren&#39;t left out of the equation, too.  We are also fortunate that my husband can moonlight occasionally to help us save for/meet extra expenses.  Even if he didn&#39;t moonlight though, we are in the best financial shape we&#39;ve ever been in.  And once he gets out of the Air Force, it will be even better... his pay will more than double (he is a nurse anesthetist).<br/>

are health insurance programs available for the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581242221">I second what Angela said. We also pay quite a bit for health insurance and <br/>
are getting by on  one income. I stopped working outside the home 5 years ago <br/>
with the birth of our first child. I think at the time I was actually the one <br/>
with the insurance and the biggest paycheck! We just knew that me being home <br/>
was most important for us and we found a way. There was a time when my <br/>
husband worked 3 jobs and I know that is not for everyone but it is what <br/>
worked best for us. Finally, he is working just one job :) For a while I did <br/>
do some work selling on Ebay. It took a great deal of time for me and it just <br/>
was not worth it. We just look for ways to save $$ now(we don&#39;t have nintendo <br/>
or a microwave and we just got our first cd player  :)). If you need to get a <br/>
part-time job I would consider the restaurant field. Depending on where you <br/>
live, you can often make much more per hour than in a typical &quot;part-time&quot; job <br/>
at least that has been our experience and we have a family of five--good <br/>
luck! M.</div>

<div>A while back, someone (John A.??) posted an article about pursuing jobs

(at </div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51003987">I think that is the same book I picked up last night, if not, it was something<br/>
named really close to it. I will be reviewing our finances/income/expenses over<br/>
the next few days or so and try to work on the spreadsheets they discuss. That<br/>
way I should at least really understand what kind of $ I will be losing or who<br/>
knows, winning. I appreciate all of the business advise. I think most of those<br/>
&quot;niche&quot; businesses around here end up going to unions. I have in the past,<br/>
worked a little side line business of my own that was actually being a rep for<br/>
Tattoo-A-Pet. It was mainly because I had a strong need to have my dogs tattooed<br/>
and there was no one around to do so except the vets and then they did not<br/>
register them. It brought in a little bit of extra cash, but I was not doing it<br/>
then for the money at all. Now I will probably look into either the micro chip<br/>
or get into a business where I help out the seniors in my area (again, I think<br/>
our town offers a lot of this though for free). Getting health care is a<br/>
different story. Going to a service such as Blue Cross/Shield will cost my<br/>
family a ton, especially if I wanted to get prenatal care if we decide to add<br/>
more to our family (which we do want to). I will not go with HMO&#39;s. I am<br/>
strongly against them (that is a totally different conversation). We have<br/>
already discussed moving, but our house is very small and moving into a<br/>
&quot;cheaper&quot; area will really just mean moving into a more dangerous area.<br/>
Unschooling my girls has been the only thing on my mind lately so I am really<br/>
doing research. Thank you for all your help.<br/>
