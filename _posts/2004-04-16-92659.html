<div id="ygrps-yiv-446742536">I just read a great book called _Playful Parenting_ by Lawrence Cohen <br/>
and I really liked what he had to say on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
Cohen says that kids (like other animals) aren&#39;t just learning about <br/>
aggression when they play fight--they are learning how to control and <br/>
restrain themselves. &quot;When children in the U.S. play war, they are <br/>
usually doing the same thing that lion cubs are doing when they play <br/>
fight: testing their muscles and their &quot;claws,&quot; and exploring the <br/>
complex world of conflicts, alliances, and strategies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He also has a wonderful idea of something to try if a child starts <br/>
pointing a toy or pretend gun at you: call it the love gun and say it <br/>
makes you give him/her tons of hugs and kisses! My 3.5 yr old, who <br/>
doesn&#39;t even understand exactly what a &quot;shooter&quot; does, thinks this is <br/>
the funniest thing ever. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to quote a couple more chapters, but I&#39;ll restrain myself!<br/>

lion cubs. Children can talk and you can ask them what<br/>
are they doing. Lion cubs you can just make guesses<br/>
(and in this case antropromorphise).<br/>

to blow kisses with his hand!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184748540">No, he doesn&#39;t say that, I just didn&#39;t explain very well. Cohen most <br/>
definitely advocates exploring feelings of all sorts in play and <br/>
advises parents to play in order to understand what their kids are <br/>
feeling and to help them work through issues, if/when they have them. <br/>
So if another child was mean to your child at the playground, your <br/>
child might come home and start hitting dolls. Instead of, as Leo <br/>
suggested, saying that it wasn&#39;t a good thing to do, you&#39;d play <br/>
through various scenarios, maybe pretending to be the mean doll or <br/>
the doll that was sad--wherever the child led. Let them speak and you <br/>
may find that they are afraid of someone else&#39;s violence, or sad <br/>
about something that happened or who knows. <br/>
<br/>
But sometimes pointing a toy/pretend gun isn&#39;t aggressive or violent <br/>
play. My son learned to do it because the other kids were doing it <br/>
and thinks it&#39;s something fun. Instead of pushing him away telling <br/>
him he&#39;s doing something wrong, make a connection by starting a game. <br/>
Cohen also suggests that parents act out dramatic death scenes <br/>
if &quot;shot&quot;, so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s advocating suppressing, just giving <br/>
an alternative, esp. to parents who aren&#39;t comfortable with pretend <br/>
guns being pointed at them. Playing instead of lecturing, yippee!<br/>
<br/>
When my son starts to understand that &quot;shooters&quot; are supposed to hurt <br/>
people, I&#39;ll play along at times and I&#39;ll answer the questions he has <br/>
about people getting hurt. I also might try to play &#39;love gun&#39; <br/>
sometimes. Or he might want to. <br/>
<br/>
I was trying to be brief and kinda left out the point! Sorry.<br/>
