<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838178155">&quot;The show was banned for a short while. Now he can watch it and enjoy it<br/>
without it &#39;taking over&#39; his daily life.  It wasn&#39;t a good thing to watch if<br/>
he couldn&#39;t determine what was real and what was not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is why all parents should really study child development!! To understand these types of behaviors. A child that is very young can NOT possibly make a clear distinction between reality and imaginary. It&#39;s ok, really.<br/>
It&#39;s part of their development to slowly start seeing the difference and nothing you ban or do or say is going to speed that process up. In fact, it&#39;s very HEALTHY and should be encouraged, not prohibited.<br/>
