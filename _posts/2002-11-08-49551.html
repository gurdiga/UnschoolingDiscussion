<div id="ygrps-yiv-732019509">WOW! <br/>
That was really, really interesting. I always was taught that &quot;thee&quot; and <br/>
&quot;thou&quot; were respectful and that&#39;s why we used them.<br/>
Going through my religion/unschooling epiphany caused me to pray in a much <br/>
more down to earth style. Using &quot;you&quot; and more like dialoguing with God.<br/>
It just felt right to me. I was leaving behind everything I was taught was <br/>
right and good, and finding my own truth.<br/>
To learn the actual history of the words is really cool.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; And I&#39;m guessing God is &quot;Du&quot;?<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t read the German bible. Didn&#39;t go to any German church services. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brenda?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, by luck, I just unpacked the box containing my German New Testament<br/>
(RSV, I think).  So I checked.  Well, duh.  God is usually &quot;er&quot;, which is<br/>
HE!  <br/>
<br/>
However, in John 17:1, where Jesus is praying to God, he refers to God in<br/>
the informal (deinen, dich):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Vater, die Stunde is gekommen.  Veherrliche deinen Sohn, damit der sohn<br/>
dich verherrliche.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also checked how Jesus is addressed (in this translation, at least).<br/>
Jesus&#39; disciples, John&#39;s disciples, and the unclean leper all refer to Jesus<br/>
as &quot;du&quot;, the familiar.<br/>
<br/>
In the Lord&#39;s prayer, (Matthew 6:7), Jesus teaches the disciples to pray<br/>
using the familiar:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unser Vater, der in den Himmeln, geheiligt werde dein Name.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband says he&#39;ll check the Greek NT next time he&#39;s at his office, to<br/>
see how the original Greek renders it.  Hope this helps for now.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Does anyone (Sandra) have any books on the subject to recommend? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there these days for word origins.  When I was <br/>
little, there was a book in our school&#39;s library about the history of <br/>
language and writing, and I bought one from scholastic books for 35 cents or <br/>
so in 4th grade.  Had it for years.  Might still have it, come to think of <br/>
it.  They stapled them in the early 60&#39;s. so they stay together better than <br/>
&quot;perma bound&quot; (glued to paper) pages.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I have a dozen or twenty books about English trivia, development, <br/>
and such.  But none that would appeal to kids, and I can&#39;t list titles <br/>
because they&#39;re a flight and a half of stairs from me and my wheelchair.   IN <br/>
JANUARY I will see my library again. &lt;g&gt;  (Probably December.)<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching Jr. High, instead of a textbook we used paperbacks of the <br/>
American Heritage Dictionary which has lots of word origins, and we played a <br/>
game (A LOT) where someone would name a word and I (at first, and soon kids) <br/>
would guess what language it came from.  In no time, it&#39;s not &quot;guessing,&quot; <br/>
it&#39;s knowing.  That lead to the fun of tracking down the oddities.  <br/>
<br/>
In the backs of those dictionaries is the &quot;Indo European Roots appendix&quot; and <br/>
with that they show how some of the oldest words, like &quot;book&quot; and &quot;ship&quot; are <br/>
related to so many other languages, and what the sound seems to REALLY <br/>
originally have indicated.  Winter is a good one too, related to &quot;water,&quot; <br/>
although that&#39;s not apparent in English.  <br/>
<br/>
So just playing with dictionaries (or online etymological sites) is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Just like anything else, I think instead of making a unit study of something, <br/>
just becoming open to learning more about it for the rest of your life is <br/>
good enough. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t binge.  I BINGE!   A friend in England sent her <br/>
daughter here to spend time with grandparents and friends.  There was a <br/>
schedule.  She was with us for three days.  It was very efficient.  But <br/>
anyway, gifts were sent.  I got books from thrift stores.  A 1950s imprint of <br/>
Seven Years in Tibet.  I just finished it this morning.  While I was reading <br/>
it, I kept looking things up on the web, I watched the movie again, read <br/>
commentary about the movie, and talked to various friends about what I was <br/>
reading.   So although it was immersion, in a way, I&#39;ll keep adding to my <br/>
knowledge of those days for the rest of my life (or until Alzheimer&#39;s <br/>
distracts me).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an SCA-focussed article which might be of use to a few people here, <br/>
though.  Because the best source for what English sounded like 400 years ago <br/>
is still the King James Bible.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll put the text in my next e-mail, because sometimes pasting a text into an <br/>
e-mail here makes me lose what I&#39;ve written.  It would be clearer on the page <br/>
anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I seem to be in nostalgia mode today.  There was a time, a long time, in my <br/>
teens - maybe all my teenage years - where my family could not make it <br/>
through dinner without bringing the Oxford English Dictionary to the dinner <br/>
table.  We had some really great discussions, were perpetually losing the <br/>
magnifying glass and settled some major disputed.  In my twenties the OED was <br/>
revised and my parents gave me the two volume set at Christmas.  One of the <br/>
best presents I&#39;ve ever received...<br/>

The magnifying glass is sitting right here, on my scanner.  I mentioned to <br/>
Holly just the other day that I was proud that I had never lost it, in nearly <br/>
thirty years of owning it.  I will put it back in its little blue cardboard <br/>
drawer before I go to sleep tonight.  <br/>
