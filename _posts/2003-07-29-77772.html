<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249225724">Oh, Nancy!!!  I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you!  That&#39;s the problem with <br/>
E-mail lists.  You get this great community, and when stuff like this <br/>
happens, we can&#39;t run over and grab your kids or bring you food!  If I <br/>
wasn&#39;t all the way across the continent from you, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d <br/>
like to do.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had some sanity-preserving ideas for you, but beyond the obvious <br/>
stuff (videos, reading, etc.), I&#39;m at a loss.  Does your older kid like to <br/>
help out with the wee one?  Could your older kid be enlisted to help?<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could be more help, but I&#39;ll be others who&#39;ve been down that road <br/>
will be able to give you good stuff.  In the meantime, you&#39;re in my <br/>
thoughts and I hope you heal quickly!!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs (not too hard),<br/>

<br/>
 How about a tub of water on the kitchen floor with some bubbles and plastic<br/>
dishes to &#39;wash&#39;. My little one loves that!<br/>
<br/>
Or bubbles,you know blowing them. All my kids love blowing bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Or outside under the sprinkler on the grass especially good for naked kids!<br/>
<br/>
Would the 8yod be into cutting out pictures from magazines and helping the<br/>
2yod to glue them to make their own picture books?<br/>
<br/>
No-bake cooking: 2 cups of crushed cookies, 1 cup of coconut, 2-3<br/>
tablespoons cocoa, 400grams sweetened condensed milk. Mix all ingredients<br/>
together. Shape into balls and roll in extra coconut. Chill. Okay, it will<br/>
be messy but fun. Should keep the 2yod sucking on his fingers happily for<br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
HTH. Get better!<br/>

say perhaps this accident has a deeper purpose, meaning some cosmic <br/>
intervention of sorts, that at the moment seems a large hurdle, but in the long run will <br/>
be something that may have slowed you and yours down for a wonderous reason. <br/>
You have by no means &quot;ruined&quot; the summer for your family. Maybe you will end <br/>
up having the time of your lives and everyone will remember it as the summer <br/>
mom broke her arm, thereby marking the impression that much more. So as hard as <br/>
it is to see now, I will hope for you that this summer will still be great and <br/>
things you may have been in too fast of motion to see before will have <br/>
greater clarity now, because you have time to really see. (Not that you weren&#39;t <br/>
looking before!)<br/>

You can still HAVE footsteps.  I had a couple of months of wheeltracks.   <br/>
Just awful.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith has had a broken arm and though a broken leg is horrible, at least I <br/>
could eat and put my clothes on and ... you know, wipe my ASS. <br/>
<br/>
I had to do all kinds of things for Keith when he was in a cast.  His right <br/>
handed writing was no worse than his normal lefty, which was good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But to type one handed or use the mouse with the off hand would be sad, and <br/>
HOW can you make stuff for the kids to play with and how can you let them play <br/>
in water in the house if you can&#39;t mop up??  <br/>
<br/>
I recommend scooting towels around with your feet.  But I&#39;m really sorry you <br/>
broke your arm.   At least my kids were big enough that I could zonk out on <br/>
pain pills and sleep the day away.<br/>
<br/>
After a long day with food prep and house straightening and party-servicing, <br/>
both my feet hurt, and once the kid who needs a ride is safely home (I&#39;m the <br/>
back-up plan in case nobody else walks her home or gives her a ride, she only <br/>
lives about six or seven blocks away, but one female alone this late in the <br/>
dark isn&#39;t ideal), I&#39;m going to read and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I would be way willing to let your kids play in my back yard and watch my <br/>
videos and play our video games and chase my cats while you zonked out if I <br/>
weren&#39;t so far far away.<br/>

eating, left for wiping... well, in some cultures anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When Rain broke her arm she had just started knitting again, and she was<br/>
really excited about the scarf she was making and she couldn&#39;t knit with<br/>
the cast on, so that was hard. She figured out how to manuever on the<br/>
laptop with the cast , though. It has the little square thing rather than<br/>
a mouse, so it was easier. Holding a book was hard initially, but she got<br/>
the hang of it. I did button all of her pants that has buttons, but<br/>
generally she wore stuff she could do herself, like sweats and leggings<br/>
(it was winter).<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s leg was about the same time as Rain&#39;s arm, and the leg really<br/>
seemed more painful and like a bigger hassle, FWIW. But I&#39;m sorry you<br/>
broke your arm, too, because it definitely wasn&#39;t any fun.<br/>
<br/>
And Rain&#39;s arm is still crooked, but the ortho looked at it for 30<br/>
seconds, charged us $125, and said he&#39;d see her again in 6 months and<br/>
everything was fine...<br/>

least I still have my left hand for stuff. As a lefty that is a relief. If my <br/>
ass didn&#39;t hurt so much I would hsve water in the house but we are doing it <br/>
outside. It&#39;s keeping dd on the 2 acres, out of horse pen, off road, not <br/>
falling off climber and covered from sunburn that is challenge. She is in the nude <br/>
phase and hates sunscreen. She is  a wondrous creature and a pleasure to watch <br/>
exploring. If we lived next door I would pay Holly to hang with my kids. <br/>
Ds is home from aborted sleepover. I love Maureen for letting him try and <br/>
then driving sll the way home at 11pm. She inspires me as a parent. DS was <br/>
weeping one night about death and what ifs. he said if me and dh died he would like <br/>
maureen and Tim to live in our house with their 4 kidsand my 2. He felt that <br/>
would give their family more space and he could stay living here.He says <br/>
Maureen is the nicest mom he knows.<br/>
KIDS ARE SO COOL<br/>
Rambling now, must stop, no painkillers as nursing, so this just lonely me.<br/>

I would need the other hand. oops, won&#39;t start that again.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

    I wish I were close enough to actually *do* something. Take the kids for<br/>
the day. Play in the water with them. Let&#39;s see 2yo....a wading pool or<br/>
sprinkler, playdoh on the patio, water color painting there too. Cookie<br/>
sheet play, pudding, whipped cream, sand (shoe box works for this one too),<br/>
shaving cream if your 2yo doesn&#39;t put things in the mouth. Sandbox play. Oh<br/>
how about taking a large ziploc, put oil in there and add some food<br/>
coloring. You can draw on the bag with your finger and make the colors move.<br/>
They separate again once your done. I think I&#39;ve got that right. It&#39;s been a<br/>
while. Paper bag puppets, vests can be made from the big bags. Craft suppies<br/>
could be a life saver for your 8yo. How about a diorama of some kind with a<br/>
shoe box? <br/>
    That&#39;s all I can think of for now. Take care of you and try to not do to<br/>
much too soon. You could hurt yourself all over again. I&#39;ve done that. :-(<br/>
My thoughts are with you. Speedy recovery! :-)<br/>

  Help! got bucked off my horse on Sat. and landed hard. Broken humerus, sore <br/>
  back, bruised hip etc. Very busy almost 2 yr old and almost 8 yr old. Need fun <br/>
  summer ideas for preserving my sanity and theirs while staying at home as i <br/>
  can&#39;t drive, right now can hardly walk. Nursing is a real challenge, and toddler <br/>

  Most of all, I will need this list for some intellectual stimulation.<br/>
  Hard to type with one hand so will continue lurking, tho it is mouse hand <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not yet.  Not exactly.  They&#39;ve made it legal for medicinal use, but the<br/>
hoops to be jumped through aren&#39;t worth it for most people.  And you&#39;d still<br/>
have to buy it from the dealers.  They&#39;re *talking* about decriminalization<br/>
for small amounts, but what that means is fines and no record instead of<br/>
jail and a record.  That will certainly benefit the kids who are going to<br/>
grow up to be politicians.  I&#39;m not sure it will benefit anyone else.  In<br/>
some jurisdictions where they&#39;ve done that (New Zealand?) more people have<br/>
gone to jail than before because they couldn&#39;t pay the fines .<br/>
