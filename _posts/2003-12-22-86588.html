Maybe he knows himself. I frequently ask the kids to remind me about things <br/>
-- &quot;remind me to look that up later&quot; &quot;remind me to look for that when we get <br/>
home&quot; &quot;remind me to mail that&quot; Please! Some of us can use all the help we can <br/>
get and if it comes from a family member, that&#39;s OK too. :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140202684">&lt;&lt;I asked him.  He wants the reminders.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand this boy.  I think perhaps his twin was seperated at birth and<br/>
came to live at my house.  Zach is 10 and has lots of interests.  He is<br/>
never forced to do any activities.  However, whatever he is doing NOW is the<br/>
most important thing in the universe.  Sometimes that keeps him from doing<br/>
things that he wants to do, sometimes even things that he wants to do MORE.<br/>
I think is has to do with the ability to set priorities, to be able to<br/>
change gears easily, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Zach gets a reminder or two, but then I leave it alone.  Personal preference<br/>
of mine.<br/>
