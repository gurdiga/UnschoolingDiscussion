<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  That&#39;s right.  We hope our children become real suckers.  And we also<br/>
want them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>
<br/>
We derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David Thoreau<br/>
&#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>
live deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>
knowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>
the budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>
comfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.  A<br/>
sucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker is<br/>
all there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Sound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>
to help children learn to be suckers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be a sucker yourself<br/>
<br/>
Model a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>
time.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>
Travel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>
you meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>
people who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>
looking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>
your children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>
joining in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give children time and space<br/>
<br/>
Overscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>
eyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve got<br/>
to leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>
games, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them to<br/>
the very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>
tinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>
ability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So don<br/>
&#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seek inspiration from other suckers<br/>
<br/>
Mandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>
minute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>
away from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>
money, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives, and<br/>
distract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the ones<br/>
who are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>
learning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>
lifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who did<br/>
extraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the fullest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The lifelong quest<br/>
<br/>
Suck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>
its essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>
spontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with our<br/>
interior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>
in the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>
date.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so intent<br/>
on teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>
<br/>

that was great,,,a wonderful twist on &#39;sucker&#39;, and very true to what a &#39;true <br/>
sucker&#39; is--one who puts the emphasis on what can i get out of this <br/>
experience, but not in a superficial way,,or in a me thing,,,,but in a very <br/>
deep need to know for the sake of knowing and nothing else kind of way.  I <br/>
loved it.  Thanks for touching that part.<br/>
