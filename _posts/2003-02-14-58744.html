 </span></blockquote>I wonder if this is something that should be mentioned to new unschoolers as<br/>
a possible pitfall.  Kind of like, if a new mother *knows* that there are<br/>
certain periods when growth spurts can be expected, she won&#39;t be as likely<br/>
to thing that she &quot;just doesn&#39;t have enough milk&quot;.  Maybe we need to warn<br/>
people about that place where it&#39;s going to look like our kids aren&#39;t<br/>
learning anything and the school kids are.  I know I fell for that trap, and<br/>
it was what influenced me to start pushing reading at age 12.<br/>
