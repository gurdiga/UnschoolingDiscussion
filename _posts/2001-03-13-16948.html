<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376730501">Hello, all:<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list. I am a sahm/wahm from Michigan (Detroit area) <br/>
and I just took my girls out of public school in January. My daughters <br/>
are almost 12 years old (12 in April) and almost 9 years old (9 <br/>
in May). I also have an almost 7 week old son.  <br/>
<br/>
I noticed, after reading some of the postings, that some of you have <br/>
daughters who are my kid&#39;s ages. Would any of your girls want to <br/>
become e-mail pals with my girls? They have been asking me every day <br/>
about finding some pen pals who also home school.<br/>
<br/>
I fell into this unschooling thing --- I was pregnant, miserable and <br/>
tired, so they pretty much guided themselves to what they wanted to <br/>
learn when I first took them out of public school in January. Then, <br/>
when my son was born, well ... you all know what it&#39;s like having a <br/>
newborn --- so they kept pursuing their own interests because of the <br/>
demands of the baby. <br/>
<br/>
This unschooling thing seems very natural --- just like it felt when <br/>
they were very small and I taught them throughout the day --- or they <br/>
investigated the world around them on their own. However, on the other <br/>
hand, I feel like I should be giving them more structure and so do <br/>
they --- they want worksheets and assignments. I bought some worksheet <br/>
books and they use them occasionally. But mostly they love to play <br/>
Barbie&#39;s, make doll clothes, draw, write, read, do computer games or <br/>
play with Lego&#39;s. Hmmm. I&#39;m just new to this and trying to adjust ... <br/>
 <br/>
Any advice? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m doing okay and should just keep doing <br/>
what I&#39;m doing, but then the guilt sets in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Nancy from Michigan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763410168">Hello and welcome~! The only advice I can really offer<br/>
is to relax and never stop questioning. The more you<br/>
doubt, the more you&#39;ll prove to yourself that your<br/>
doing whats right. If you&#39;re doing whats right. Relax<br/>
and let the girls be kids and have a fun time. Making<br/>
doll cloths is an excellent skill builder. And its<br/>
fun, isnt that enough when your a kid?<br/>
