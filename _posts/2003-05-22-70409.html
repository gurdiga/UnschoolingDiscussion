&gt; &gt;clothes.  Very embarrassing.  What is it about teachers and the <br/>

&gt; &gt;Wouldn&#39;t a person know if they had to go or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In middle school my daughter asked to go the bathroom and the teacher said <br/>
no, should have went during lunch.  Great idea except they are not allowed to <br/>
leave the lunch room and there isn&#39;t one in there.<br/>
<br/>
She had started her period at an odd time but &quot;felt&quot; it becoming a mess.  She <br/>
asked repeatedly and even said, I&#39;m having a personal problem that I need to <br/>
take care of immediately.  Still not happening, this was a male teacher.  That <br/>
afternoon (thankfully this was last class of the day) she came home in tears <br/>
and immediately her dad went to the school and talked to the principal and <br/>
explained that when little girls (or boys for that matter) BEG to go to the <br/>
bathroom, even revealing personal information out loud at that age, it&#39;s highly <br/>
embarrassing, even more so when they teacher for no good reason simply refuses to <br/>
allow it, seemingly enjoying the power of the &quot;begging&quot; and &quot;refusing&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course the principal acted appalled and said it would never happen again <br/>
and would talk to the teacher about being more sensitive and he probably didn&#39;t <br/>
even realize about &quot;girly&quot; things like that.  My husband said if it happened <br/>
again he WOULD embarrass the teacher equally in front of his peers (how I <br/>
don&#39;t know, but he was plenty upset).  The principal even said that he doubts <br/>
there is ANY time in the day to use the bathroom unless you get excused from class <br/>
and would reiterate that with the staff.<br/>
<br/>
Next day, teacher calls my daughter aside, apologizes said next time she <br/>
needs to go, just ask and he will be understanding.  So, days or weeks or whatever <br/>
goes by and she needs to go, he immediately signs her pass and off she goes, <br/>
within minutes, she said there were three other girls from the class in there <br/>
as well.  Laughing, goofing off, fixing hair and such.  So she understood WHY <br/>
they are so reluctant to let someone go, sometimes they just want to hang out <br/>
in the bathroom (who wouldn&#39;t with some teachers?) and it makes it hard for <br/>
the ones who REALLY have to go.<br/>
<br/>
That is really how a lot of things end up being so controlled I guess.  <br/>
Because a few misuse and abuse things, they feel they have to be guarded or <br/>
controlled to prevent this, making the innocent suffer instead of punishing those who <br/>
choose to abuse whatever privilege or perceived privilege.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly isn&#39;t right but it happens all the time, in lots of ways.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very sad to think of all these things happening to little kids who are <br/>
forming opinions about everything by what they experience.<br/>
