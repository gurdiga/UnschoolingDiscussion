&lt;&lt; Mary mentioned &quot;Junior Scrabble&quot;. The girls have it but the directions for <br/>
the &quot;easy(junior) version are missing.The side of the board that has all of <br/>
the easy words printed on  it.Anyone care to e-mail them to me? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are directions for all games on earth, I think by now, on websites.  If <br/>
you go to google I bet you can find them in a second.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s SO COOL!<br/>
