least 4 or 5 volumes now, and my dad, my brother (AKA Uncle John, at<br/>
least to Cacie), and I find them at garage sales and swap them around. My<br/>
dad actually reads them in the bathroom, rule-bound guy that he is ;-)<br/>
They&#39;re collections of interesting factoids and tidbits and stories, if<br/>
you like that sort of thing....<br/>
