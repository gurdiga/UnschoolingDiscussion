New England to meet where ever the group chooses. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748590022">It&#39;s possible to set up a database at the groups homepage.  Then each<br/>
member can go in themselves and enter in any information that want to.<br/>
The only thing necessary to start in up would be subject<br/>
headers/questions, like name, location, kids names, spouses names, etc.<br/>
It&#39;s not that hard to do and only takes about 5 minutes.<br/>

thrilled to read all of your great insights and I am really finding <br/>
my way here with my three girls. I am inspired by the unschooling <br/>
group that meets down there in Florida ( I think Mary B talks of it <br/>
or is it Sandra) anyhow, I would love to go to a group like this to <br/>
get some support in New England and just to make some Unschooling <br/>
friends for me and my family. Does anyone know of a group and if not <br/>
is anyone interested in starting one with me. I am from Gloucester MA <br/>
and because I am new to Unschooling would obviously need someone more <br/>
experienced to guide and help. Thanks for listening, Kelli&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unlurking here to mention that we have a nice group growing <br/>
slowly in RI.  I think it&#39;s probably not near enough to be handy to <br/>
Gloucester MA  but maybe you could check out one or two events...?<br/>
You can find us online at www.soshomeskoolri.org.  The website is new <br/>
and unfinished  (I am novice-webmistress--if anyone has any <br/>
constructive criticism I&#39;d be glad to hear it...).    We are an <br/>
inclusive group, and none of us is very schooly although I think I&#39;m <br/>
the most radical unschoolish of all of us. Also look for LEAF support <br/>
group in middle and southeastern MA.  I&#39;m not familiar with many of <br/>
the members there but I believe they&#39;re pretty welcoming too.   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livinglearning.homestead.com/support.html">http://www.livinglearning.homestead.com/support.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
Also I know of LOTS of people who would jump at the chance to attend  <br/>
an unschooling conference in New England.     <br/>
<br/>
Namaste to you all,<br/>
cris  (who has very nearly stopped worrying about schoolish issues <br/>
because of the support I gain just from reading this list!!   THANK <br/>
YOU!!!!) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, LEAF is welcoming to everyone and has a mix of homeschooling <br/>
styles. Some of the more vocal members are on the unschooling end of <br/>
the spectrum. :-) (I am co-moderator of the LEAF list.) Our website <br/>
can be found at <br/>

Unfortunately, LEAF is quite far from Gloucester. For information <br/>
about groups in that area I would check the website <br/>

That is too funny!!  I was born and raised in SLC - dh was born there as well but moved around a bit and liked living in a small town better than the &quot;big city&quot;.  When ds got to be school age we decided to get out of there.  We lived in Sugarhouse...right on Highland Drive....we had a corner home with a rod iron fence which on two separate occasions cars crashed through and ended up almost at our front door!  It was definitely time to get out of there.    We had some property on the road that leads to Chesterfield!  A job for dh came up in Twin rather than Pocatello though, so here we are....sold the property in Lava and bought a second acre here adjoining our property.  I&#39;d love to bring the kids and come swimming once the pool is opened up....we could get together if you like.  Why did you leave Utah?<br/>

we get a season pass every summer for the pool. I can hardly wait for <br/>
it to open. You MUST come over this way. We have lots of room at our <br/>

We moved there after we got married.  I went to West High.  The house is on the corner of Highland Drive and Stratford Avenue....big corner lot (for Sugarhouse anyway!).  <br/>
<br/>
The Lava property......hmmmm.......it has been soooo long I will do my best to explain.  You turned right by where ligertown used to be....I think it may even be a highway.  The properties were on the left side of the road -- across the RR tracks and over the river.  When we bought it there were only a couple of houses up -- bet there are several now!  (If you followed this road around it would circle back up to Soda Springs I think....)<br/>
<br/>
The fire pit sounds GREAT!  We are hoping to put one in here this summer.  We definitely MUST get together!  My kids are 12 and 9 (soon to be 10).  Nice to meet you too!!  <br/>

on that highway to Whiskey Mike&#39;s, and past Whiskey Mike&#39;s one mile, <br/>
is our road, and we&#39;re three miles up that road. Just six miles from <br/>
the reservoir. <br/>

If you kept going past Kelly Toponce Rd, through Bancroft, you&#39;d get <br/>
to the Intersection. Turn left, and you&#39;re on your way to Soda. what <br/>
a hoot...<br/>
<br/>
How long have you been unschooling/homeschooling? I&#39;d love to have <br/>
some time with a family who are DOING this. I have a 10 and 8, almost <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508350874">Okay! this is neat.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve been cleaning up the pool the past couple of weeks. The last <br/>
two years, they&#39;ve been open on weekends for the two weeks before <br/>
Memorial Day. And Mem. Day itself is, of course, THE worst day for <br/>
crowds there. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just now making the committment for unschooling, and most <br/>
likely never will be radical, i.e. no bedtimes, etc... but we&#39;ve been <br/>
homeschooling in a quite relaxed manner, for eight years. That is, <br/>
our 15 year old girl has been home educated since we took her out of <br/>
gov&#39;t school in first grade. So, is your nine year old a boy or girl? <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if we need to go off-list at this point? LOL <br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi<br/>
