Ds asked  me how much it&#39;d cost to have the locksmith out  <br/>
and when I told him  $45 he offered to pay me back. That was sweet. I  <br/>
told him that I  appreciated his offer but that wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
necessary.  These  things happen. <br/>

==============<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s sweet.<br/>
 <br/>
When we&#39;re going out away from the house any distance, we take extra  keys.  <br/>
My husband and I learned that YEARS ago, locking the keys in our car  in <br/>
another state, so it&#39;s routine for trips.   <br/>
 <br/>
When my husband was living in Minneapolis and wasn&#39;t going to be available  <br/>
to bring us extra keys, we&#39;d take extras even if we were just going to the zoo  <br/>
or somewhere in town, or especially if we visited friends or relatives for  <br/>
overnighters.  That&#39;s when people are getting stuff in and out of cars the  <br/>
most.  <br/>
 <br/>
$45 is only half the price of one visit with a therapist (or a third of the  <br/>
price in some markets&lt;g&gt;), and yet parents forget that going off on a kid  can <br/>
be expensive all kinds of ways in the longrun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Good story!<br/>
