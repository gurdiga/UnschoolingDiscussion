&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the word I&#39;m thinking is &#39;then&#39; but I spell it &#39;than&#39;, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that&#39;s going to be confusing for the person reading what I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;written, even if they can get the basic idea from the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;context.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not necesarily.  I often miss typos in reading because I&#39;m reading for <br/>
&gt; content and meaning and not focusing on spelling.  Emails come through <br/>
&gt; lists like this all the time with poor spelling or grammar, yet it is <br/>
&gt; usually quite easy to figure out what the person is saying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t take this to mean that I don&#39;t think spelling matters.  I just don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; think it is the highly critical thing that some people would like us to <br/>
&gt; believe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how to find them on the internet, but I have received several <br/>
&gt; emails over the years with words purposely mispelled or repeated.  Most <br/>
&gt; people when they read these phrases are quite able to read what it means. <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any of these handy?  A friend sent me one recently in <br/>
&gt; which &quot;they&quot; have decided to simplify English spelling by deleting letters <br/>
&gt; with the same sound.  For instance, we don&#39;t need both &quot;c&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.  The <br/>
&gt; email is a joke, and by the end of it the words are not spelled <br/>
&gt; &quot;correctly&quot; but it is easy enough to read them anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This ability to gloss over mistakes is important to consider in editing. <br/>
&gt; A friend (in his 70s) said that in college they used to edit papers by <br/>
&gt; going from the end to the beginning one word at a time.  Otherwise, they <br/>
&gt; would read right over mispellings because their mind knew what it was <br/>
&gt; supposed to be and didn&#39;t always see what it was.  This was in the days <br/>
&gt; before word processors and spell check.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve discussed the role of editors with my kids.  We like to catch typos <br/>
&gt; in published materials.<br/>

I agree that it is fairly easy to read but my boss might not be very amused  <br/>
if I sent out a memo or letter with that type of spelling.<br/>
 <br/>
Spell check is certainly a good thing for that.<br/>
