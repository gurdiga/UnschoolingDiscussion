 Respectful parenting and interpersonal communication are my passions. I&#39;ve <br/>
been studying these since childhood and used to know a lot about them :-). <br/>
Almost daily i am discovering how little I truly know, how often i screw up <br/>
(and my teen confirms this :-)), how much parenting is really mostly about <br/>
*me* growing, how much i still want to learn about practising respect and <br/>
compassion. I&#39;m excited about that journey! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think you&#39;ll like it here.<br/>
It&#39;s changed my life for the better, and my childrens!! Welcome.<br/>
