<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113975950">Tomorrow my son Julian turns 16.  And in the past few weeks we&#39;ve  watched <br/>
some big changes in him, and most of them are a result of unschooling. I  <br/>
thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
 <br/>
Julian was just hired for his first real job. Not at McDonald&#39;s or at a  g<br/>
rocery store, but instead he was hired as the Coordinator of Religious  Education <br/>
in the Salem, MA Unitarian Universalist church where he grew  up -- a job <br/>
that I held several years ago. (I am the Director of Religious  Education in the <br/>
Wakefield UU church, so we are now colleagues.)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a complex job, requiring a lot of organization, working with both kids  <br/>
and adults, multiple meetings, public speaking, etc. Churches usually hire  <br/>
people who are not only adults, but also college graduates for this position.  <br/>
Julian, with some help, wrote a great resume and cover letter. We prepped him  <br/>
for the interview. <br/>
 <br/>
But it was really all him. Julian expresses himself in a way that is more  <br/>
calm and mature than most adults I know. I was concerned at first that parents  <br/>
with kids there might be concerned with having &quot;a kid&quot; leading the program, <br/>
but  when we attended a potluck last night, parent after parent approached him,  <br/>
telling him they were delighted he&#39;d accepted the position.<br/>
 <br/>
Before accepting the position he called a district leader for advice, then  <br/>
negotiated with the Board chair for time off (to go to the L&L conference,  <br/>
among other things!), more hours if he needs them, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
So this is a big change, but much bigger is, in recent weeks, the change  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen in Juls. He&#39;s just become remarkably more grown-up. Part of it is  <br/>
little things, being more focused and attentive to things around him. Part of  him <br/>
seems more serious, but as big a part is that he seems to have lightened up  <br/>
a little. To quote the wise Julian, he is awesome. It&#39;s becoming clear what <br/>
kind  of man he will be: smart, funny, kind, responsible, thoughtful, talented.<br/>
 <br/>
Loud, discordant music still plays and there are still piles of dirty  socks. <br/>
But I&#39;m kind of liking that, because the little boy doesn&#39;t really live  here <br/>
anymore. In his place is a really impressive, way cool young man. Big  <br/>
Changes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301455952">Very COOL.<br/>
I hope Julian has a great birthday and enjoys this job.   That will look <br/>
fantastic on a resume.   Very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Nice post.   I saved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412142702">Thanks for this story.  I have been in a debate with a friend who in theory <br/>
agrees with &quot;most&quot; of the unschooling idea, from a John Holt/education <br/>
perspective (we haven&#39;t even begun to discuss whole life unschooling) and <br/>
this is a wonderful real life example of what can happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804067125">Pat Farenga posted this to the NewEnglandUnschooling list. I didn&#39;t  <br/>
go to the conference (it was wicked expensive!) A couple of the  <br/>
people who did go said nice things about it.<br/>
<br/>
The speakers were all &quot;experts&quot; with nice credentials and good  <br/>
resumes ;-) but that doesn&#39;t mean what they had to say might not be  <br/>
interesting :-)<br/>
