<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003842944">Yes, Bridget YOU.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t resist. You asked for pet peeves about spelling. And since I <br/>
think that listservs are not a place to discuss spelling (heck, most of <br/>
us do it with one hand and half an eye on the screen) I still couldn&#39;t <br/>
let this one slide!<br/>
<br/>
MY pet peeve is the punctuation of using apostrophes when not necessary <br/>
in relation to dates, and acronyms.<br/>

<br/>
1900s<br/>
<br/>
Unless of course you are refering to something possisive of that period. <br/>
For example 1960&#39;s country singer Johnny Cash.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a banner across the side of a building. It was one block long. <br/>
Saying 1000&#39;s of CD&#39;s and Tapes.<br/>
<br/>
See the irony?<br/>
<br/>
Tapes didn&#39;t have the apostrophe. But the others did. It should read <br/>
1000s of CDs and Tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, thats all my input on pet peevish spelling/grammar. Most of the <br/>
time I realize that English isn&#39;t a first language to people on the net. <br/>
And most of the ones that English is, went to public school *smirk*<br/>
<br/>
Plus the fact that I&#39;ve really lost all my &#39;schoolish&#39; stuff such as <br/>
spelling and pennmanship!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662423937">It&#39;s funny you should pick that one to single out!  Our exchange <br/>
student is a senior and he used a quote in an english term paper that <br/>
included - - 1960&#39;s - - with the apostrophe.  His teacher flagged it <br/>
and said he should have use [sic].  Well, being the grammar nazi that <br/>
I am, I had to go look it up.  According to Little Brown 7th edition <br/>
either way is correct when referring to a year or range of years.<br/>
<br/>
BUT in the other case you cited, I&#39;d agree it should be 1000s of CDs <br/>
and tapes.<br/>
 <br/>
AND then you have to take into account age of the writer too.  Rules  <br/>
have changed in my lifetime.  It is really hard to change thirty year <br/>
old writing habits to meet the current MLA guidelines!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s &lt;g&gt; not that hard if you remember that you only need the apostrophe if <br/>
you could write [it is] in place of [it&#39;s].<br/>
It&#39;s raining = It is raining.<br/>
The word [its] is already possesive, so you don&#39;t need an apostrophe if <br/>
you&#39;re using it that way.<br/>
They couldn&#39;t ride the bike because one of [its] tires was flat. - You <br/>
don&#39;t need it there.<br/>
