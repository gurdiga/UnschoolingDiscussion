can actually read but don&#39;t know it?  Or they can read but *we* don&#39;t know <br/>
it?    &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Sorry, never heard of the game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978315322">We have it. My boys have not shown an interest in using it other than to turn it on one time. My oldest is 10. I feel that to utilize this program you need a very strong desire to want to read.<br/>
  It starts with very simple words. This sight has a demo you can download to look at it. I think it usually comes with a guarantee of a refund. I didn&#39;t utilize it because thought maybe I might need it in the future as my oldest has a problem with being able to sound out new words. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787870695">Don&#39;t know.  A homeschooling friend asked about it and I&#39;d never heard of<br/>
it, which I told her.  But, I&#39;ve never looked into anything for reading<br/>
because all the kids were early readers and self-taught.  So, I figured<br/>
maybe someone on the lists would have heard about it.<br/>
