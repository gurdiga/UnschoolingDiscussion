Dear Homeschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
If you are a new homeschooler and your life is running<br/>
on schedule you may have felt the first tendrils of flame<br/>
licking around your feet.  In February it could burst into<br/>
full blaze and you will recognize that you are in the midst<br/>
of a BURN-OUT!  I thought today might be a good day to hear<br/>
my sure-fire burn-out avoidance theory.  Just like the<br/>
seasons we have in nature, a homeschooler has seasons.<br/>
If you recognize the natural pitfalls, maybe you can prolong<br/>
the welcome seasons and minimize the uncomfortable ones.<br/>
<br/>
The first season of the year usually comes in the fall.<br/>
Since most of us are somewhat institutionalized, we believe<br/>
school should start September 5, or so.  Remember that<br/>
schools originally started in the fall to allow for students<br/>
to help with the farm work and harvest.  When summer was<br/>
over most students couldn&#39;t wait to get into the classroom<br/>
where the hard work was over.  It passed down to the rest of<br/>
us and even K-Mart is into the swing of it.  I love<br/>
back-to-school sales and take full advantage.  There is<br/>
something so promising about a full packet of clean paper<br/>
and 20 sharpened pencils.  The exciting new lunch boxes,<br/>
pencil boxes and notebook designs always inspire me.  My<br/>
kids and I pour over the left-overs in late September when<br/>
they are even cheaper.  The smell and feel of school<br/>
supplies are actually inspirational.  We have some of our<br/>
best work enshrined in my kids &quot;baby boxes&quot; on My Pretty<br/>
Little Pony and Strawberry Shortcake notebooks with only<br/>
5 or 6 pages used.  This fall season is when you should make<br/>
hay while the sun shines!  Go for it!  Those wonderful plans<br/>
to make a timeline, or study world geography by making your<br/>
own map and having penpals over the e-mail...YES!  Start<br/>
those unit studies, or do 10 pages a day in your workbooks.<br/>
Let yourselves go, because winter is around the bend and<br/>
winter sometimes brings burn-out.<br/>
<br/>
Here is where my Burn-Out Avoidance Theory (or BOAT) takes<br/>
shape.  Some people use plain old endurance to get through<br/>
burn-out, but I get in my BOAT and take a ride.  I love kids<br/>
and usually have a few extras around.  One thing I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
is how they love to catch a ride on my passions.  I garden,<br/>
draw a little, write, quilt, read, collect things, re-work<br/>
old junk, junk store shop, talk to old people, crochet, watch<br/>
baseball, arrange flowers, and  home decorate to name a few<br/>
interests.  Each is very educational.  Gardening alone covers<br/>
Latin, botany, writing, art, science, P.E., math, history,<br/>
and geology.  Whatever passion I am currently indulging in,<br/>
becomes our curriculum.  Not that I take it and turn it into<br/>
a unit study.  That would be great, but would only increase<br/>
the burn-out.  Do that in a building season, not a rest<br/>
season like winter.  Just take your passion and indulge<br/>
in it.<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH TV WHILE YOU ARE INDULGING.  And<br/>
if your passion is TV, (excuse me while I am a little blunt)<br/>
get a life.  From the time you were a little kid there were<br/>
things you liked more than other things.  What are they?  If<br/>
you are a type A parent you probably have forgotten them in<br/>
the passion of parenting.  Try giving that a rest for a few<br/>
minutes and think about something that you like to do.  If<br/>
you are really stuck, go to the library and walk up and down<br/>
the non-fiction aisles and pull out titles that interest you<br/>
just a little.  Take them home and put them in a convenient<br/>
location.  If you feel you must, assign your children their<br/>
work while you look at the pictures.  When you see something<br/>
that gives you that little thrill of passion, do something<br/>
about it.  Go to the craft store and buy a birdhouse kit, for<br/>
example, anything to start the motion.  You will see that the<br/>
energy of the project will carry you along.  And your kid&#39;s<br/>
interest will also excite you.  Double impetus.<br/>
<br/>
And what are your kids learning during this time?  That life<br/>
is an exciting place with vast possibilities.  That learning<br/>
is something that starts at birth and goes on for a lifetime<br/>
if you stay interested.  That gaining new knowledge is fun<br/>
and only takes place in a text book in a very small part of<br/>
life.  That information gained from life experiences can be<br/>
supplemented by study, which is the real basis for learning.<br/>
We institutionalized people think that we should give<br/>
children a whole bunch of information with no place to store<br/>
it and hope that if they ever need it they may be able to<br/>
find the place they put it.  Outside of school, learning<br/>
takes place with experience and we go to a resource to find<br/>
the information that we are lacking.  School can be a cart<br/>
before the horse sort of thing.  Your interests and passions<br/>
are God-given and keep you on the learning edge.  If you give<br/>
them up to homeschool your children, you may be doing them a<br/>
dis-service.  So, for Burn-Out avoidance, I recommend you<br/>
start thinking about what interests you.<br/>
<br/>
My classic example of passion leading to usefulness is the<br/>
wonderful story of George Washington Carver.  His adopted<br/>
parents, previously his owners, allowed him to follow his<br/>
interests outdoors with plant life when he was done with his<br/>
kitchen chores.  George went on to be a world famous botanist<br/>
and scientist.  He told everyone who came to him, black or<br/>
white, &quot;If I can do it, you can do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another fascinating illustration is Winston Churchill, the<br/>
great leader of England during the Second World War.  Winston<br/>
was raised to be a peer in pre-war England.  He was part of<br/>
the royal family.  He was taught at home and then sent to<br/>
prestigious schools.  He had a passion for military history,<br/>
in fact, his only good grades as a student came from<br/>
memorizing military poetry and fencing.  His father<br/>
completely washed his hands of Winston the last time he was<br/>
kicked out of school and the boy spent most of his time<br/>
playing soldier games with the servants&#39; children.  He would<br/>
organize the staff children against the village children<br/>
using his cousins for generals of the village.  In one<br/>
extravagant game he was surrounded by his &quot;enemies&quot; on a<br/>
20 foot high bridge.  He jumped to avoid capture and nearly<br/>
killed himself.  The next months he was completely bedridden<br/>
and &quot;found himself&quot; academically.  He was 17.  Not only is<br/>
Winston credited with coming from behind and saving<br/>
Great Britain from the German war machine, he was an officer,<br/>
journalist, artist, novelist, and devoted husband.<br/>
<br/>
I recently watched portraits being done of my husband and my<br/>
youngest son.  Watching the hands of the 17 year-old girl so<br/>
deftly capturing my loved-ones faces, I asked her, &quot;Where do<br/>
you go to school?&quot;  &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t take art lessons.  I never<br/>
have.  My father&#39;s an artist.  I&#39;ve just watched him all my<br/>
life.&quot;  &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;a homeschooler, huh?&quot;  She laughed and<br/>
said, &quot;I guess I am.  I never thought of it that way before.<br/>
But I graduate from real school this year.  I&#39;m a senior.<br/>
&quot;Real school?  I guess it&#39;s a perspective thing.<br/>
<br/>
