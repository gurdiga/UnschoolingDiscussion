I don&#39;t know if this book is in the library, but it sounded helpful in<br/>
making choices.<br/>

From one of the most prestigious nonprofit organizations devoted to<br/>
environmental issues comes a clear, practical, and rational overview of<br/>
the relationship between consumers and the environment. <br/>
<br/>
Paper or plastic? Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or<br/>
disposable? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others<br/>
are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality<br/>
of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important<br/>
issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform<br/>
consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the<br/>
environment. For example, a few major decisions -- such as the choice of<br/>
a house or vehicle -- have such a disproportionately large affect on the<br/>
environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison. <br/>
<br/>
This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related<br/>
Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11<br/>
Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption. Learn what you<br/>
can do to have a truly significant impact on our world from the people<br/>
who are at the forefront of scientific research.<br/>
<br/>
Excerpts:<br/>
<br/>
Consumers are often severely limited in their choices, and the economic<br/>
market is frequently structured in such a way that makes environmentally<br/>
sound options unattractive. In other cases, businesses and other<br/>
institutions, rather than individual consumers, are the key<br/>
decision-makers. Government can, and should, help expand the choices,<br/>
make responsible behavior appealing, and influence the behavior of<br/>
institutions. Good government policies are needed for action on the<br/>
personal lifestyle level to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Reviews:<br/>
<br/>
Too many people drive their Land Rovers to the grocery store and think<br/>
that &#39;paper or plastic&#39; is a meaningful choice. The Consumer&#39;s Guide To<br/>
Effective Environmental Choices will help you distinguish the crucial<br/>
from the trivial and make choices that are congruent with your values. <br/>
