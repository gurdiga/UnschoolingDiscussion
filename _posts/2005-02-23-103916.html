We&#39;ve  been on a Steve Martin kick.  Best of from Saturday Night Live (now <br/>
Lisa  wants to see the Coneheads movie), Parenthood, and just today, Father of <br/>
the  Bride.  We watched a DVD of the Sonny and Cher show and discovered Steve  <br/>
Martin there too!  Fun!<br/>

Especially if your kids have watched Chicago (there&#39;s an actress in  common) <br/>
or if they like Eddie Murphy in addition to Steve Martin.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen Nell, but Holly probably hasn&#39;t.  I should rent that.   Thanks.<br/>
