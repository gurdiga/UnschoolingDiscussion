<div id="ygrps-yiv-888230229">I am very excited about the probability of my life going in this<br/>
direction.  I am also a little nervous about making such a big change.<br/>
<br/>
I was born and raised in NY.  I went to public school (very<br/>
competitive), and to The Johns Hopkins University in MD for college.  I<br/>
spent six years there and got my MA in Chemistry.  I met my husband Tim<br/>
there (he is from CA).  We work at the same small community college in a<br/>
<br/>
small West Texas town called Levelland - I teach chemistry and he is the<br/>
<br/>
network administrator.  My oldest Zachary is in K this year, Zane will<br/>
be 4 in March and my new darling McKenna is 7 months.  Over the past few<br/>
<br/>
years, we have grown into raising our children with attachment parenting<br/>
<br/>
(didn&#39;t start out that way but are now) and non-punative discipline.<br/>
<br/>
I took last semester off after having McKenna - I wanted to be able to<br/>
give her an &quot;in-arms&quot; experience for her first 6 months.  It was<br/>
wonderful to be home.  I enjoyed it more than I thought possible.  I<br/>
began to wonder if we could manage on just one income until the kids<br/>
were school aged - now I&#39;m wondering how to go about getting my oldest<br/>
out of school and staying home to learn with them.  I began reading John<br/>
Holt&#39;s work and have become fascinated with it.  I am no longer a<br/>
believer in performance based learning, and long to allow my family to<br/>
grow without schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself rejecting more and more of our western culture and<br/>
becoming less mainstream.  Out here, in West Texas, the atmosphere is<br/>
very conservative and structured.  I am not a church goer.  I do not<br/>
believe in punishment of any kind.  I am becoming fairly isolated and<br/>
fear that my ideas will only take me more towards isolation.  The<br/>
internet is a wonderful &quot;place&quot; to contact like-minded people, but it is<br/>
<br/>
not the same as having a real community.  This is something that I am<br/>
struggling with at the moment.  I do not see our society producing<br/>
people that are truly happy with their lives.  I want different for my<br/>
family, but I wonder if it is possible to be truly happy in isolation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any questions right now, but I&#39;m sure I will.  I will be<br/>
resigning my position at the end of this semester and making decisions<br/>
about homeschooling during the summer.  For now, I will be reading and<br/>
longing for warmer weather.<br/>
<br/>
All my best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021124970">Mara, what an interesting voyage you have made.  It is always interesting to<br/>
me the number of teachers who homeschool.<br/>
Enjoy the relaxed way of doing things.  I love that part.  We do what we<br/>
want as it happens.  John Holt is one of my most favorites to read.  He<br/>
makes so much sense.<br/>
Don&#39;t get to worried, just have fun.  (though this is easier said than done)<br/>
<br/>
A<br/>
Oh, BTW, welcome to the list.  Wonderful, interesting people here.</div>

is that we are so spread out.  I did see some groups in Austin and Houston but<br/>
they are both over 7 hours from me by car.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717272212">hi,<br/>
<br/>
we live in austin and texas is an easy state to homeschool in as far as the<br/>
laws go.  i minored in education in college (majored in art - painting at<br/>
the university of cal at davis i had hopes of teaching - college level art)<br/>
and what they taught us in the required education classes was so offensive<br/>
i never had any doubts that when i had kids i would not subject them to<br/>
that kind of manipulation and constant judgment.<br/>
<br/>
austin has its religious conservative element (cheact has some 500 members)<br/>
but there are liberals and unschoolers here as well.  we are members of the<br/>
local inclusive homeschool group (aah with i believe 250 members there are<br/>
lots of goods links on their website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.austin360.com/community/groups/homeschoolers/index.html)">http://www.austin360.com/community/groups/homeschoolers/index.html)</a> and<br/>
there are many religious people as members of this group as well.  we<br/>
pretty much do our own thing and rely on the group for info on local events<br/>
and park days when we choose to go and will probably get more involved as<br/>
rene&#39; gets older (he&#39;s really into robots and is demanding to build a metal<br/>
one , which he&#39;s already designed- i know nothing about robotics).<br/>
<br/>
we all share a bed - we have one 4 yo son, rene&#39; (second on the way due in<br/>
aug/sept so i&#39;m in the throws of morning sickness - yuck)  and we&#39;ve spent<br/>
very little time apart.  a few years ago - when rene&#39; was 20 months i<br/>
acquired an autoimmune disease &#39;still&#39;s disease&#39; (akin to rheumatoid<br/>
arthritis and lupus) which destroyed virtually all the muscles in my<br/>
shoulders (i couldn&#39;t hold him or change a diaper for over 3 months).  this<br/>
was believed to be a side effected of a vaccine i had been given in &#39;89 and<br/>
appears to have finally gone after 2 1/2 years.   we have no family in the<br/>
area and were relatively new here and had virtually no friends (we left<br/>
them all in northern cal).   anyway the reason i&#39;m telling you this is to<br/>
say that any situation is conducive to homeschooling.  some situations may<br/>
appear harder than others but when you accept the situation as you<br/>
experience it, you can begin to find its own particular strengths.<br/>
<br/>
personally i would have loved something different and have gone through<br/>
long periods of doubt, self pity, guilt... you name it,  but recently i&#39;ve<br/>
realized the strengths and gifts that came along with our particular<br/>
reality.  we are still judged by some family members - mostly my husband&#39;s<br/>
because they have a lot invested in the ps system and because we are pretty<br/>
clear and well versed and can not only hold our ground but really offer up<br/>
some good solid arguments for homeschooling and this annoys them.   i see<br/>
these judgments as their short coming because they allow society to make<br/>
their decision for them rather than do the research and choose for<br/>
themselves ( i love options:) - a sad state of affairs in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
as far as isolation goes you may need to do that for a little while just to<br/>
make the complete change - you know, clean out all those sneaky unconscious<br/>
beliefs stuck in the far recesses of your mind:) and find out what you want<br/>
for your own family.  life is noisy and sometimes we need to take a break<br/>
so we can have our own thoughts without all the fears and doubts expressed<br/>
by those around us.  i think people can be truly happy in any situation<br/>
because happiness - to me - is about love and when you have that for<br/>
yourself then everything else is fine and very workable because then you<br/>
can be creative and that is at the heart of unschooling.   but take it one<br/>
step at a time and don&#39;t give yourself a &#39;report card&#39; just watch and enjoy<br/>
and indulge, and what you and your family needs and wants will show itself.<br/>
