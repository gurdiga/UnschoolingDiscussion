<div id="ygrps-yiv-641255289">We relocated back to Maryland from Texas just a little over a year ago.  We <br/>
left in June of 1999 and there were water restrictions at that time - like <br/>
not washing your car - but nothing like I have seen on the news lately.  Back <br/>
here in Maryland though, it seems we can;t get out from under the clouds.  I <br/>
know you need rain and if I could send it I would.  I feel water logged!<br/>
