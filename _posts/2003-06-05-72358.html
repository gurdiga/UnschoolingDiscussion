<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We went through this whole &quot;To fear factor or not to fear factor&quot; <br/>
&gt; thing here as well.  The major issue we had with the show was the <br/>
&gt; lack of sportsmanship and general talking &quot;crap&quot; that went on<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My major issue with this show is it makes me GAG frequently.  My children <br/>
(who are older though) would be free to choose to watch it (as they were at any <br/>
age) but they&#39;ve changed channels watching it too.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son was over the other night and switched to it and the younger boy <br/>
said &quot;turn it, this makes Mom sick&quot;, I offered to not be bothered by it if <br/>
they wanted to see it but they chose something else.<br/>
<br/>
I guess by letting children choose it comes back in good and thoughtful ways, <br/>
even when they are nearly grown children.<br/>
<br/>
I will also add about the food/candy my children have ALWAYS been free to <br/>
choose what to eat/not eat.  Candy was ALWAYS sitting around and bags in the <br/>
cupboards, but so was fruit, cheese (gotta love these new string cheese things!) <br/>
and fresh veggies.<br/>
<br/>
My kids rarely eat candy.  One son LOVES cake, pies and ice cream type <br/>
desserts, one loves the fruit bar popsicle type treats, the girls, they like a very <br/>
GOOD dessert every now and again.<br/>
<br/>
When other children would come over, I&#39;ve seen them eat themselves sick <br/>
eating a pile of chocolate candy that was set out.  At first I thought maybe I <br/>
should say something since there were eating so much, but I don&#39;t limit mine so I <br/>
didn&#39;t.  More than once I&#39;ve had mothers call me irate about &quot;allowing&quot; their <br/>
children to eat so much candy at my house.<br/>
<br/>
What to do?  Tell them they CAN&#39;T eat candy here or that they can only have <br/>
one or two pieces?  To my kids that sounded selfish and it always made the <br/>
other kids sneak and eat it anyway.  I could put it away when certain kids were <br/>
coming over I guess or remind them they got sick last time and their mother <br/>
wasn&#39;t happy?<br/>
<br/>
I never did find a good way to handle this, I didn&#39;t feel like it was my job <br/>
to police other peoples children regarding candy that was sitting out. <br/>
<br/>
I know others wondered why MY kids didn&#39;t get sick from it, I guess because <br/>
it WAS available they knew when they truly wanted it, they could have it.  My <br/>
15 (yes she&#39;s officially 15 now) year old gets cravings for chocolate during <br/>
the month, but only wants GOOD chocolate, Godiva and her dad indulges her (and <br/>
himself).  <br/>
<br/>
My kids LOVE veggies, raw, cooked, they don&#39;t care they eat them.  Only one <br/>
child is a picky eater.  The one that was two when I was in college and my <br/>
mother watched.  She had lots of rules regarding food.  He&#39;s going to be 22 and <br/>
STILL runs for the snack cupboard when he comes here, he knows he&#39;s free to take <br/>
whatever he chooses, eat it here or take it home, he usually does both!  My <br/>
oldest daughter finds it amusing that he&#39;s still so child like in that regard.  <br/>
Two weeks ago he put a Klondike bar in his jacket pocket to take home to eat <br/>
later.  He took off his jacket in the truck and forgot about the ice cream... <br/>
nice mess the next day at work.  Now he takes the whole box, in a bag, no more <br/>
forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think limiting them definitely makes some children want it so much more and <br/>
they WILL eat themselves sick, I guess because they don&#39;t know when they will <br/>
be allowed any more.<br/>
<br/>
I bet there is still trick or treat candy stashed in Cait&#39;s room somewhere <br/>
from last year uneaten, probably even Christmas Stocking candy, her room is due <br/>
a good spring cleaning, I&#39;m sure of it, maybe next week...<br/>

School kids around here are getting out for summer lately.  And, as in<br/>

are all totally scarfing what we have around her.  I have a family of<br/>
six already,  and cannot afford to have them all have this newfound<br/>

<br/>

go of many issues with regard to foods and eating.  I have a ways to go.<br/>
I still make judgement comments at times to my own children,  but am<br/>
more aware and trying to weed these poison attitudes out of my system.<br/>
The neighborhood kids scarfing all our food, esp. &quot;treats&quot; is<br/>
frustrating and expensive.  I am trying to have things available like<br/>
popcorn, homemade cookies, etc, which are less expensive.  Any other<br/>
ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For younger kids I&#39;m not sure other that what you are doing.  I did at one <br/>
point have to hide snacks, sodas, etc., when my boys were teenagers.  There <br/>
might be fifteen or twenty teenagers here and maybe three or four were <br/>
disrespectful enough that if there were four or five cases of soda downstairs, they <br/>
thought they HAD to drink it all because they COULD.<br/>
<br/>
The final straw was a couple hundred dollars worth of food disappearing in a <br/>
day... no one can afford that every day.  My kids starting seeing that if they <br/>
had disrespectful kids here (usually a friend of someone else who tagged <br/>
along with someone else that was here) and they drank up all the sodas, juices, <br/>
Gatorades and ate all the sandwich stuff, snack stuff and even the FOOD in the <br/>
freezer, then they were the ones that suffered because that amount might very <br/>
well have lasted them for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
They would tell their friends NOT to bring so and so over anymore, but often <br/>
times when they were driving, they show up because so and so was here and <br/>
proceed to indulge in everything they could get, without an invitation.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were sensitive to this and before this really bad summer was over all <br/>
non perishable snacks and stuff were in MY bedroom closet.  I hated that, the <br/>
kids hated that.  It seemed so selfish and was really because of a very small <br/>
amount of their friends.<br/>
<br/>
Finally one day my DH came home and caught some kid rummaging through my <br/>
bedroom because he had seen the kids go in and come out with sodas so he (in his <br/>
disrespectful manner) was helping himself.<br/>
<br/>
He made it CLEAR that this is NOT a free food bank, it&#39;s NOT a buffet and <br/>
it&#39;s NOT their home, so if they are not OFFERED anything, then don&#39;t take it or <br/>
look for it.<br/>
<br/>
It was kinda mortifying but he had enough, so had we.  Guess what they <br/>
&quot;offenders&quot; were not at all phased by it, they somehow feel it wasn&#39;t meant for <br/>
THEM, after all they are just friends of whoever, not my kid.<br/>
<br/>
It can get ugly, I&#39;m not sure of a good way to head it off.  Don&#39;t get me <br/>
wrong we have lots of kids here all the time and I feed them, I cook specifically <br/>
for them, but respectful kids, kind kids, kids who are FRIENDS to my kids.  <br/>
Kids who don&#39;t think they should load up their pockets with bottles of soda to <br/>
take with them, or just call other people to come hang out at my house.<br/>
<br/>
We let it go to far for too long when we moved here and the kids got older.  <br/>
It&#39;s hard to limit other kids when yours don&#39;t need/don&#39;t get limits on food.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will feed any child that&#39;s hungry but you have to be careful not to let <br/>
your house turn into the &quot;free food bank&quot; as my DH often refers to this one.  I <br/>
once found my next door neighbor child standing in my front door handing out 24 <br/>
ounce bottles of soda to every child within blocks that came and asked for <br/>
it, (he came in through the kitchen door while we were gone) he was nine at the <br/>
time.  He thought it was a good thing to do since his Mom wouldn&#39;t let him <br/>
give out his food and drinks to the neighborhood...<br/>
<br/>
My only advice it to either hide it (which always feels wrong and stingy when <br/>
I do it) or set ground rules early (which is hard when you don&#39;t have them <br/>
for your own and your kids might not understand) or limit the number of children <br/>
at your house to a couple at a time (which seems to punish your own children <br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to &quot;hearing&quot; creative ways others deal with this. Sometimes it <br/>
still is a bit of an issue here, especially with DH, I just mostly raise my <br/>
eyebrows at them and it stops anymore trips to the cupboard or fridge or <br/>
freezer.  Once they know you are watching them, suddenly they get a grip on <br/>
themselves, SOMETIMES.<br/>

it&#39;s no big deal, but these kids that aren&#39;t familiar with no restrictions come <br/>
along and just start honking down like mad.<br/>
I don&#39;t mind feeding them. I DO mind one or two kids wiping out two batches <br/>
of cookies, so I put stuff away sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I know one neighbor girl really loves yogurt and her Mom doesn&#39;t buy it, so <br/>
she always has a yogurt or two...no biggie. And she loves apples. But when it <br/>
comes to more expensive ingredients I will hide stuff. Haven&#39;t dealt with any <br/>
rude teens, so far all the older kids are really neat people and we enjoy <br/>
having them over.  Actually, all of their friends are likeable, it&#39;s just the two <br/>
neighbor kids that tend to go nuts over any kind of &quot;treat&quot;. But they don&#39;t get <br/>
a lot of parental interaction, I mostly feel bad for them and want our home <br/>
to be a haven.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48241308">On hot summer days, I sometimes make kool-aid slushies.  I buy the<br/>
unsweetened kool-aid when it&#39;s on sale (10 or 12 packs for $1).  I mix it<br/>
with 1/2 cup sugar, instead of the 1 cup called for.  I add only half the<br/>
water, then put it in the blender with ice for a slushy or &quot;slurpee&quot;<br/>
consistency.<br/>
<br/>
This treat is far cheaper than popsicles and has less carbohydrate than<br/>
apple juice.  Plus, it gets really hot here so it&#39;s a good way to get fluid<br/>
into the kids.<br/>

I just wish I could find a way to do this without the artificial color.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082078501">I don&#39;t know if this will help, but here&#39;s what I did this morning. This will, hopefully, get us through the weekend, with my little brother over today-sunday. And a group of very hungry adults over for gameing on sun.<br/>
 <br/>
We hit the produce store and bought a bunch of veggies and fruit, whatever was on sale and the kids requests. I spent a while cutting up the veggies, cubing up some cheese, also on sale, and putting the fruit in fridge to get cold. I made some popcorn and put it in a few different snack size bags. I did the same with some almost empty bags of chips and pretzles. I put all the snack bags in a basket where the kids, and adults, can get to them. The fruit, veggies, and cheese are also kept on a shelf in containers where the kids can get to them asd I can easily throw together a &#39;monkey platter&#39; - just one of Sandras great ideas, my kids and company love this.<br/>
 <br/>
I found a couple of boxes of jello, gelatin and pudding that I had forgotten about. I made up the pudding added a little whip cream and poured it into cups and poped it in the freeze, viola, the pudding pops that the kids wanted and we just didn&#39;t have the money for. I also made up the jello added a little flat soda that was in the back of the fridge and poured it into muffin tins and into the freezer they went. I also made them some juice pops with juice and the little bit of soda that was left, they went farther that way. <br/>
 <br/>
I also try to put together small containers of dips, peanut butter, salad dressing, yogurt, hummas-if I&#39;ve made any. things like that so they can dip their fruit, veggies, and chips in.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that amounts is important to kids, well, at least to mine. If a huge bag of chips is sitting there, they just keep snacking, if I&#39;ve taken the time to make smaller portions they know they can go get more if they are still hungry but don&#39;t feel the need to keep eating. (we stoped restricting food about 6-7 months ago). It is also really important to my kids to each have they&#39;re own bag, plate, bowl whatever, so breaking things up also helps with that.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helped at all, I seem to have rambled a bit. :)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help, but here&#39;s what I did this morning. This<br/>
will, hopefully, get us through the weekend, with my little brother over<br/>
today-sunday. And a group of very hungry adults over for gameing on sun.<br/>
 <br/>
We hit the produce store and bought a bunch of veggies and fruit,<br/>
whatever was on sale and the kids requests. I spent a while cutting up<br/>
the veggies, cubing up some cheese, also on sale, and putting the fruit<br/>
in fridge to get cold. I made some popcorn and put it in a few different<br/>
snack size bags. I did the same with some almost empty bags of chips and<br/>
pretzles. I put all the snack bags in a basket where the kids, and<br/>
adults, can get to them. The fruit, veggies, and cheese are also kept on<br/>
a shelf in containers where the kids can get to them asd I can easily<br/>
throw together a &#39;monkey platter&#39; - just one of Sandras great ideas, my<br/>
kids and company love this.<br/>
 <br/>
I found a couple of boxes of jello, gelatin and pudding that I had<br/>
forgotten about. I made up the pudding added a little whip cream and<br/>
poured it into cups and poped it in the freeze, viola, the pudding pops<br/>
that the kids wanted and we just didn&#39;t have the money for. I also made<br/>
up the jello added a little flat soda that was in the back of the fridge<br/>
and poured it into muffin tins and into the freezer they went. I also<br/>
made them some juice pops with juice and the little bit of soda that was<br/>
left, they went farther that way. <br/>
 <br/>
I also try to put together small containers of dips, peanut butter,<br/>
salad dressing, yogurt, hummas-if I&#39;ve made any. things like that so<br/>
they can dip their fruit, veggies, and chips in.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that amounts is important to kids, well, at least to mine.<br/>
If a huge bag of chips is sitting there, they just keep snacking, if<br/>
I&#39;ve taken the time to make smaller portions they know they can go get<br/>
more if they are still hungry but don&#39;t feel the need to keep eating.<br/>
(we stoped restricting food about 6-7 months ago). It is also really<br/>
important to my kids to each have they&#39;re own bag, plate, bowl whatever,<br/>
so breaking things up also helps with that.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helped at all, I seem to have rambled a bit. :)<br/>

Sliced apples.<br/>
On-sale and then watered-down juice?<br/>

What a bunch of great ideas!  Not just for compnay, but for daily <br/>
living.  I, like many here, are trying to undo food restrictions on <br/>
ourselves.  I am still trying to get off these 25 baby pounds are <br/>
here we are ready to try again.  How the hell did that happen??  <br/>
Anyway, I am going to try some of these ideas here as well.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>probably.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We found that they do bring food to share - a packet of chips from home, a bottle of lemonade, a bag of fruit. They did have food at home - they are at our house for the fun and companionship. Kids not having food at home was not our experience - it was more that they just ate our food all the time cos they are here all the time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I probably answered that too incompletely, there ARE some kids who would <br/>
gladly bring food, but not usually the ones who eat us out of house and home.  The <br/>
kids who are here all the time are very respectful and kind and I don&#39;t mind <br/>
feeding them at all.  It&#39;s the child who is usually a friend of a friend who <br/>
is just remotely &quot;related&quot; to my kids or their activities that behave that way, <br/>
probably because they know they don&#39;t come regularly and so they don&#39;t care <br/>
what if they are disrespectful or what others think.  <br/>
<br/>
I could be totally wrong and they do it for other reasons.  Most of the <br/>
&quot;older&quot; kids this happens at nights after most of us are in bed and the nearly <br/>
grown ones are playing video games and watching movies, listening to music and <br/>
such.  Someone will be here and someone else is looking for them so they show up <br/>
to play or watch and they wander upstairs and help themselves, sometimes to <br/>
EVERYTHING they can find.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so bad now, my 18 year old has begun to speak out about others being <br/>
disrespectful in HIS home and will tell his good friends NOT to bring <br/>
__________ back over again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we had five extra kids for dinner, all very respectful and good <br/>
friends of my kids.  I didn&#39;t know they were going to be here when I planned <br/>
dinner, but my son got a new car so they all had to come and oohh and ahhh over it.  <br/>
It was dinner time, so I had my oldest run by the store on the way over and <br/>
get me more potatoes and steaks and they all had a great time with dinner on <br/>
the deck.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I can just talk them into helping CLEAN, it will be a GREAT evening!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved hearing the suggestions that you all have for snacks and the <br/>
little baggies and such.  I&#39;m going to try that next week with the little neighbor <br/>
children that like to run in and grab treats, it&#39;s much better than them <br/>
sticking half washed hands into the chip bag too.  GREAT IDEAS!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814686836">I wanted to let anyone trying the frozen jello in the muffin tins, if they get really good and frozen, they won&#39;t come out of the tin. We had this happen, the kids we&#39;re all a little sad that they had to wait about 10-20min for them to soften enough to pull the paper out.<br/>
 <br/>
But, this was everyone favorite, the kids loved it! <br/>
 <br/>
Another side note.... if you replace the cold water when your making jello and add vodka, pour into small paper cups and freeze or refrigerate for a couple hours you have jello shooters, we make these for just about every party. YUMMY. <br/>
Watermelon and black cherry are my faves. My friend swears by lemon or lime with tequila. Anothre friend likes coconut cream jello and rum.<br/>
