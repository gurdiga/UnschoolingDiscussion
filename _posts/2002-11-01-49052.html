<div id="ygrps-yiv-670092252">I am sending this to request your help. My husband and<br/>
I have become involved with a group of parents who<br/>
have had children in the NICU at St. John&#39;s Mercy in<br/>
St. Louis, Missouri. Our Jakob was born at 24weeks<br/>
gestation (1lb. 10oz) and was at St. John&#39;s for a long<br/>
while. By the time we left, we had become very<br/>
attached to the hospital and the NICU. We decided to<br/>
get involved with this group to help other families<br/>
who are going through a crisis such as ours. <br/>
Below is a form for our annual fundraiser (of which I<br/>
am in charge!), &quot;Letters From Santa&quot;. Please check it<br/>
out and see if it is something you are interested in<br/>
sharing with your little ones. We are trying to boost<br/>
our efforts this year, so please forward this to<br/>
anyone who you think might be interested (co-workers,<br/>
friends, relatives, etc).<br/>
Thanks in advance for your support.<br/>

Letters from Santa!<br/>
<br/>
Imagine the delight in your children�s eyes when they<br/>
receive a letter from Santa Claus. What better way to<br/>
spread Christmas joy than to give your child a<br/>
friendly surprise or tell a friend or relative you are<br/>
thinking about them? With just a little information<br/>
from you, the St. John�s Mercy NICUPs will send your<br/>
loved ones a personalized letter from Santa. Get a<br/>
jump-start on Christmas by requesting your letters<br/>
early!<br/>
<br/>
Who are the NICUPs? We are a group of graduate parents<br/>
from the St. John�s Mercy Medical Center Neonatal<br/>
Intensive Care Unit who provide support for families<br/>
with babies in the NICU. Having a child in the NICU is<br/>
an overwhelming emotional crisis for families to<br/>
endure and we offer support during this difficult<br/>
time. In the past, we have used the proceeds from our<br/>
annual fundraiser to provide new furniture for the<br/>
parent waiting areas and toys to occupy siblings while<br/>
visiting the unit. This year, we hope to receive<br/>
enough donations to purchase new Medela breast pumps<br/>
for the NICU. Breastfeeding is imperative to the<br/>
health of these small infants because it provides the<br/>
necessary antibodies and nutrients that they are<br/>
missing by being born too early. We currently have a<br/>
shortage of pumps available for our mothers to use<br/>
while in the unit. Our goal is to make the pumps<br/>
readily available so that we may encourage more moms<br/>
to provide this source of nutrition for their babies<br/>
while establishing a stronger connection with their<br/>
child. <br/>
<br/>
Because we are expanding the services we hope to<br/>
perform this year, we are asking for extra help from<br/>
you this season. Please circulate our forms to any<br/>
friends, family, or co-workers who may want their own<br/>
letters from Santa. The joy you help to spread will be<br/>
felt resoundingly through the NICU all year long.<br/>
