Living is Learning Curriculum Guides by Nancy Plent<br/>
These guides are put together by Nancy Plent, founder of the Unschoolers<br/>
Network in New Jersey and a long-time homeschooler. She reviewed the scope<br/>
and sequence charts and curriculum guides of dozens of schools in various<br/>
states, then combined the highest standards of elements from each to create<br/>
these guides. Why purchase these curriculum guides? 1) They may help you to<br/>
fulfill your state&#39;s legal requirement to provide an educational plan 2)<br/>
They allow you to see some of the highest standards for schools at various<br/>
grade levels, just in case you are curious about what the schools expect or<br/>
anxious about what you are doing 3) They provide record-keeping space that<br/>
can help organize a portfolio.<br/>
Besides providing a checklist under each subject, Nancy offers suggestions<br/>
on how to translate real-life experience into curricula goals. She also<br/>
lists resources from a variety of companies. Each guide cover two or more<br/>
grade levels.<br/>

It&#39;s nice to be important, but it&#39;s more important to be nice.<br/>
