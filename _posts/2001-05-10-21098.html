<div id="ygrps-yiv-838063815">This is for all the mothers who have sat up all night with sick toddlers in<br/>
their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer wieners and cherry<br/>
Kool-Aid saying, &quot;It&#39;s OK honey, Mommy&#39;s here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Who walk around the house all night with their babies when they keep crying<br/>
and won&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who show up at work with spit-up in their  hair<br/>
and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in their purse.<br/>
<br/>
For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies and sew Halloween<br/>
costumes. And all the mothers who DON&#39;T.<br/>
<br/>
This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies they&#39;ll never see.  And the<br/>
mothers who took those babies and gave them homes.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who froze their buns off on metal  bleachers at<br/>
football or soccer games Friday night instead of watching from  cars,  so<br/>
that when their kids asked, &quot;Did you see me?&quot; they could say, &quot;Of  course, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have missed it for the world,&quot; and mean it.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in the grocery store  and<br/>
swat them in despair when they stomp their feet like a tired 2-year old  who<br/>
wants ice cream before dinner.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who sat down with their children and explained<br/>
all about making babies. And for all the mothers who wanted to but just<br/>
couldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
For all the mothers who read &quot;Goodnight, Moon&quot; twice  a night for a year.<br/>
And then read it again. &quot;Just one more time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who taught their children to tie  their<br/>
shoelaces before they started school.  And for all the mothers who opted for<br/>
Velcro instead.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to cook and their daughters<br/>
to sink a<br/>
ump shot.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all mothers whose heads turn automatically when a little voice<br/>
calls &quot;Mom?&quot; in a crowd, even though they know their own off-spring  are at<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to school with<br/>
stomachaches, assuring them they&#39;d be just FINE once they got there,  only<br/>
to get calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them to  please pick<br/>
them up. Right away.<br/>
<br/>
This is for mothers whose children have gone astray, who can&#39;t find the<br/>
words to reach them.<br/>
<br/>
For all the mothers who bite their lips sometimes until they bleed - when<br/>
their 14 year olds dye their hair green.<br/>
<br/>
What makes a good Mother anyway?  Is it patience? Compassion? Broad hips?<br/>
The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a button on a shirt, all<br/>
at the same time?  Or is it heart? Is it the ache you feel when you watch<br/>
your son or daughter disappear down the street, walking to school alone for<br/>
the very first time?  The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed<br/>
to crib at 2 A.M. to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby?  The need<br/>
to flee from wherever you are and hug your child when you hear news of a<br/>
fire, a car accident, a child dying?<br/>
<br/>
For all the mothers of the victims of all these school  shootings,and the<br/>
mothers of those who did the shooting. For the  mothers of the survivors,<br/>
and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs  in horror,hugging their child<br/>
who just came home from school, safely.<br/>
<br/>
This is for mothers who put pinwheels and teddy bears on their children&#39;s<br/>
graves.<br/>
<br/>
This is for young mothers stumbling through diaper changes and sleep<br/>
deprivation.  And mature mothers learning to let go.<br/>
<br/>
For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers.  Single mothers and married<br/>
mothers.  Mothers with money, mothers without.  This is for you all.<br/>
<br/>
So hang in there.  Please pass along to all the Mom&#39;s in your life.  &quot;Home<br/>
is what catches you when you fall - and we all fall.&quot;  Please pass this to a<br/>
wonderful mother you know.  (I just did)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958243329">Being a Mom is.....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s picking up your sleeping baby just to hold and smell.<br/>
It&#39;s hearing every breath in the middle of the night from the day they were born.<br/>
It&#39;s a million pictures.<br/>
It&#39;s aching inside with every bruised knee.<br/>
It&#39;s going to the bathroom with an audience.<br/>
It&#39;s relishing the quiet 3 a.m. feedings long after they&#39;re needed.<br/>
It&#39;s fearing the worst out of every scream.<br/>
It&#39;s wiping runny noses with your shirt.<br/>
It&#39;s playing the troll under the bridge.<br/>
It&#39;s burying crabs and snails instead of throwing them over the fence.<br/>
It&#39;s saving weeds in glasses of water.<br/>
It&#39;s kissing dirty toes.<br/>
It&#39;s constantly saying, &quot;Mommy will be right there&quot; because all your kids call from different points in the house at the same time.<br/>
It&#39;s rocking them in your arms, even when they&#39;re 10.<br/>
It&#39;s crying when you&#39;re happy.<br/>
It&#39;s finding joy in the smallest things.<br/>
It&#39;s finding laughter in faces and <br/>
finding warmth in little arms.<br/>
It&#39;s going to bed with a tired smile<br/>
and a satisfied heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668116585">That was good!  Here&#39;s another good one: <br/>
<br/>
A mother&#39;s love determines how <br/>
We love ourselves and others. <br/>
There is no sky we&#39;ll ever see <br/>
Not lit by that first love. <br/>
<br/>
Stripped of love, the universe <br/>
Would drive us mad with pain; <br/>
But we are born into a world <br/>
That greets our cries with joy. <br/>
<br/>
How much I owe you for the kiss <br/>
That told me who I was! <br/>
The greatest gift--a love of life-- <br/>
Lay laughing in your eyes. <br/>
<br/>
Because of you my world still has <br/>
The soft grace of your smile; <br/>
And every wind of fortune bears <br/>
The scent of your caress. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075056371">There was a sad period in Australia&#39;s history that is dramatized by that<br/>
film, when Aboriginal children were removed from their parents and<br/>
placed in boarding schools &quot;for their own good&quot;, and eventually taught<br/>
to be domestic servants. There are still adults searching for their<br/>
ancestry. Aborigines traditionally have very complicated family<br/>
relationships based not only on blood but also spirit relatives, with<br/>
certain taboos about intermarriage, that have been charted - some of the<br/>
ancient artworks that seem to be abstracts are &quot;family trees&quot;. The<br/>
disruption to these relationships has been very painful for the people,<br/>
a deliberate attempt to destroy the culture and spiritual life of the<br/>
tribes. Nor are they a homogenous group, but many tribes now see<br/>
themselves as one nation politically. The land rights movement has an<br/>
ironic twist. It turns out that many traditional lands, returned to the<br/>
traditional owners by the government, are the ones with highly valuable<br/>
minerals (esp. Uranium) buried in them. <br/>
