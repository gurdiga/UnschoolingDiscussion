<div id="ygrps-yiv-850030900">Hi, My name is Trisha and I&#39;ve been lurking around for a week or so. I used <br/>
to belong to this list ayear or so ago, but insubscribed because I became too <br/>
busy for all the email! I have a little more time for it now, and I don&#39;t <br/>
think I could have rejoined at a better time ,as you guys are talking about <br/>
so many issues that are relevant to me!<br/>
<br/>
1. My son Gary (7) is an only child.<br/>
<br/>
2. I have unschooled from the beginning, but this year I had been starting to <br/>
doubt I guess. Our state (KS) is one of the easiest to homeschool in, there <br/>
are NO reporting requirements, but I had been obsessing lately about <br/>
documentation. I asked myself , what would happen if he HAD to go to public <br/>
school, (for instance , if somehting happened to me) and I was looking into <br/>
things like Clonlara, where he would get &quot;transcripts&quot; Thankfully , I got <br/>
back on this list , before I blew alot of money! You guys reminded me of my <br/>
whole philosophy for doing this, and I had to question my motives. I KNOW my <br/>
son learns on his own, he has blown my mind on more than one occasion! Thanks <br/>
for restoring my faith,( and sanity!)<br/>
<br/>
3.I&#39;m another one of those &quot;alternatives&quot; being bi-poly and pagan.<br/>
<br/>
4. I think the &quot;bickering&quot;, or &quot;discussing &quot; or whatever you choose to call <br/>
it that goes on here, is actually pretty informative and often even <br/>
entertaining! It does make for a HUGE amount of email, but it&#39;s alot better <br/>
than some of the other dead lists I&#39;m on where 100+ members can&#39;t manage to <br/>
post more than once a month!<br/>
<br/>
5. I too have had bouts with illness and have worried about the amount of <br/>
energy I was able to give to my son. I would love to hear more about how <br/>
handle this.<br/>
<br/>
Well enough from me for now. It&#39;s good to be back!<br/>
<br/>
Trisha<br/>
&quot;Anything less than love is not knowledge. It is opinion or belief, and it is <br/>
always mistaken.&quot;<br/>
