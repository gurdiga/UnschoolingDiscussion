Valerie?&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
I have to ask. Have people called you &quot;Beverly&quot; most of your life? I <br/>
get called Beverly as much as I get called Valerie. They can never <br/>
tell me why they made the mistake.<br/>

**No, no. Thank YOU for being older, &lt;ahem&gt;, more mature than I am.**<br/>
<br/>
I have to ask. Have people called you &quot;Beverly&quot; most of your life? I<br/>
get called Beverly as much as I get called Valerie. They can never<br/>
tell me why they made the mistake.<br/>
<br/>
**Actually I&#39;ve always been called Cathy. And it&#39;s a Cathy that they know<br/>
personally. Once a waiter was offended that I would not admit I was his<br/>
cousin Cathy from Wisconsin. I told him I&#39;d admit it if he&#39;d pay for lunch<br/>
and how is my dear aunt? But he was a snit and wouldn&#39;t go for it. Well, you<br/>
can&#39;t pick your relatives.**<br/>

Now &quot;mature&quot; is something I&#39;ve never been accused of...not sure I can <br/>
live up to that one.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
I like that! I admit that one time I did pretend to be Beverly and <br/>
hugged the elderly couple and told them it was so good to see them. <br/>
They then backed off and looked at me and said, &quot;You&#39;re not Beverly. <br/>
She&#39;s not that nice.&quot; <br/>
