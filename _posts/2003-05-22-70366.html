<div id="ygrps-yiv-382936829">I was going to post this last night but I was too upset my DH and couldn&#39;t <br/>
think.<br/>
We have made some big changes in our home and I thought we had an <br/>
understanding. But after last night maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
The issue I have is not between he and I on the surface but more the 11 yr. <br/>
old.<br/>
He is hard on him I feel.  <br/>
Each night after dinner my DH reminds the 11yr old about clearing the table <br/>
and putting the dishes in the dishwasher.  Almost every night there is an <br/>
issue. Before DH complained it was not done right. I asked him to stop and he did <br/>
for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was going to go out to B & N to get my book. Dustin and I (the <br/>
11 yr. old) enjoy doing this together.  Dustin wanted no part of doing the <br/>
dishes and I actually have been doing it for him when he has had enough. It&#39;s <br/>
almost maddening for him, he sings, dances, wines, gets angry.  I think some of it <br/>
he inherited from me cuz I too mumble and sing made up songs when I do the <br/>
dishes also.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, (the shorter version) My DH walked into the kitchen when Dustin <br/>
announced he was done for the 3rd time and the floor was soaked.  So DH is <br/>
beginning to freak out about the floor being wet so I thought I would tone the <br/>
situation down. I squirted milk from the babies bottle at him and he began to tickle <br/>
me. Well, the 11 yr. old wanting to join in flipped the mop he was using in <br/>
the air not knowing it was going to cover DH with dirty water.  (Kinda funny but <br/>
he didn&#39;t think so. )<br/>
DH demanded he go straight to his room and ADDED oh and your NOT going to B & <br/>
N. <br/>
I was on the phone during all of this. <br/>
I got off the phone and said you know not only did you over react but you <br/>
took away the one thing he and I where looking forward too all day!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now to me having Dustin doing the dishes is just as much pulling teeth as <br/>
schoolwork is.  I am thinking I am going to go back to just doing it my self.  <br/>
I think a big part of this is my DH having control over something.<br/>
 I tell him all the time you are parenting and counting the 123 like it will <br/>
be followed by a spanking. You are trying to follow your fathers parenting and <br/>
you cant he spanked. One situation is going to take you there and I will NOT <br/>
have that in my home.<br/>
He knows and tones it done when I remind him.<br/>
<br/>
So after I pointed out what I felt was poor statements I asked him &quot;you dont <br/>
think you where wrong do you&quot;? Nope, he said.<br/>
We ended up not going. Dustin waited for me to put the baby to bed and then <br/>
said he wanted to watch the movie Speed and asked if we could go another night. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me how you all would have handled this, what and I doing wrong? <br/>

11 yr. old. The &quot;on the surface&quot; comment means that I know it is a <br/>
communication issue between DH and I and the 11 yr. old is somewhat stuck in the middle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953849271">One thing that is helping in my house is to remind dh (kindly, respectfully,<br/>
the way I would want someone to tell me) to treat the kids the way he would<br/>
treat an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he forgets.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, he said to one of the kids who was on the phone, &quot;I need to use<br/>
the phone now.&quot;, and he didn&#39;t say it in the nicest tone either.  I asked<br/>
him how he would feel if she said that to him.  It is obviously rude for a<br/>
kid to say that to an adult.  It is obviously rude for an adult to say that<br/>
to a kid!<br/>
<br/>
He understood, and rephrased it to her, and said to me that he should ask<br/>
nicely.<br/>

&lt;&lt;One thing that is helping in my house is to remind dh (kindly,<br/>
respectfully,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I am very fortunate to have my husband. He&#39;s supportive of everything I do,<br/>
never complains at all about me or the kids. He thinks I&#39;m incredible and<br/>
loves all the kids dearly. He boasts about us to anyone who will listen. He<br/>
totally got unschooling from day one. We really are on the exact same page<br/>
to many important issues, except one. You did know that was coming right?<br/>
It&#39;s the way the children are treated. Like you said, treat them the way you<br/>
would want someone to do to you. He&#39;s still old school and sometimes he<br/>
comes out witht he idea that &quot;there kids and should listen to me&quot; no matter<br/>
what he says. He&#39;s not real bad and he is getting better. But it&#39;s something<br/>
we work on every day. Usually when he handles something in not the best way,<br/>
I&#39;ll just look at him. He KNOWS I&#39;m looking at him. Probably boring holes in<br/>
his head! He&#39;ll turn to me and say, &quot;that wasn&#39;t the best way to handle that<br/>
was it?&quot; knowing what my answer is already. Most times he&#39;ll apologize to<br/>
the kids and try again, which is always better. I&#39;m trying to get him to<br/>
read some stuff and he does. I think a lot of it is just the way he was<br/>
raised. And he knows that wasn&#39;t the best, yet it&#39;s hard for him to get away<br/>
from. At least he&#39;s always open to suggestions. And sometimes when I see him<br/>
getting frustrated, I&#39;ll just tell him to go sit down and let me handle<br/>
things.<br/>

Getting dirty water on your husband wasn&#39;t as bad as what he did.  If he were <br/>
to look at your child as he would an adult guest or someone his age (a <br/>
brother or sister), he would NEVER have done what he did and expect that person to <br/>
ever visit his home again.<br/>
<br/>
Kids make mistakes, and if each mistake is treated as though it were a <br/>
malicious act, soon they won&#39;t care whether they make mistakes or not, and if <br/>
malicious acts are treated no worse than mistakes...     malice and frustration <br/>
sometimes are related.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is someone always doing the dishes WITH him, or doing them with <br/>
him helping, so he sees various ways to do things, what to do if water spills <br/>
(because even adults spill water), and you have that time to just chat.<br/>

I totally agree. My husband is getting some of this but it is defiantly a <br/>
slow progress.  He does at times follow my lead but looses it. I think the water <br/>
thing was a flashback from his being bullied days that he cant let go.  I keep <br/>
teetering back and forth on trying to respect his wishes but I know in my <br/>
heart he is being unfair.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For now until we sort through all of this I am taking the dishes back over <br/>
again. Dustin will usually stay in the kitchen with me and help anyway so I <br/>
guess before the change over that&#39;s what we where doing. It was a good time for me <br/>
to give the baby a bath or get him ready for bed. In the end looking back at <br/>
it all having him do the dishes was a break for me and not him.<br/>
