<div id="ygrps-yiv-495288354">Our kids are 10 and 7, and their favorite movies (besides the Disney ones) <br/>
are Anaconda, Demolition Man, Jaws, Jaws 2, Scary Movie, Independence Day, <br/>
MIB, and a few others.&lt;g&gt; We&#39;ve just always made sure that they *know* they <br/>
can leave the room if they&#39;re too scared or upset. Sometimes if a movie is <br/>
too scary they&#39;ll cover their own eyes and plug their own ears.&lt;g&gt; My son <br/>
(7) doesn&#39;t really like scary movies, just the action. My DD (10) on the <br/>
other hand LOVES scary movies and books (currently into the Goosebumps book <br/>
series). They *know* these books and movie aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;, so they don&#39;t <br/>
bother them in the least. Just depends on the kid, I guess :)<br/>

Sometimes it helps just to turn the soundtrack off on some movies, like Jaws. <br/>

<br/>
For me personally, I would rather my kids had seen casual sex scenes (not <br/>
porn, but hugging, the idea of undressing and getting in bed, not the <br/>
nastiness, but the happiness, in the course of a story) before they&#39;re <br/>
pubescent.  If they get the itches and urges and have no clue THEN when they <br/>
see the scenes I think they&#39;ll have an overly charged importance.  If they <br/>
see it as just a part of adult life when they&#39;re too little to care one way <br/>
or the other, it&#39;s not as powerfully alluring or exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Two of our favorite movies have scenes where the hero had an opportunity to <br/>
have sex but didn&#39;t.  Spartacus and El Cid.  In both the man already had a <br/>
platonic relationship with the woman (romantic in the latter, not in the <br/>
former) and so because she wasn&#39;t willing, he just didn&#39;t pursue it.  I think <br/>
those are more important &quot;sex scenes&quot; than some others they&#39;ve seen.<br/>

Oh yeah, our &quot;mute&quot; button gets used quite a bit, but mostly because of <br/>
commercials.&lt;g&gt; But I know what you mean. Usually though, it&#39;s *me* turning <br/>
the sounds down so my ears don&#39;t explode. LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414148902">Well, my son is 4 and so far some of his favorite movies are the Jurassic Park movies and star wars episode 1 (saw it for the 1st time yesterday and loved it). After a phase of intense interest in all episodes and movies of Pokemon nature, he seems to be showing interest in the scientific shows again :)  If your child is of a sensitive nature then work with him on what he can handle...otherwise just make sure there is a solid understanding of fact and fiction:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765723011">We just went to My Big Fat Greek Wedding,  my 8 year old loved it, I had to explain alot, but the feelings in the movie were great.  She could see how they loved each other but the woman wasn&#39;t ready to have sex for alot of the time. We had other good conversations too, like about different cultures.<br/>
