<div id="ygrps-yiv-124469718">I have a question that this message helped me remember to ask, lol.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 13.  We hav been homeschooling for a long time, but not<br/>
unschooling.  Since we are transitioning into unschooling, she has told me<br/>
that she would like to do math, but does not like the book she was using,<br/>
Singapore NEM1( Pre-Algebra and Algebra).  She said she would like to learn<br/>
some trigonometry and that she would really like to have some kind of<br/>
computer, interactive thing from which she could learn about triangles.  Any<br/>
idea?  I can&#39;t afford to spend a lot of money at this point, but want to<br/>
help her find what interests her.  (Coming from a schooling philosophy, I<br/>
have no idea how she can do trig without first doing Algebra, but I am<br/>
trying to ignore myself on that one, lol).  I did check out a trig video<br/>
from the library, can&#39;t think of what they are called at the moment.  She<br/>
watched some of it, but it didn&#39;t thrill her).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

She might just poke around with www.google.com and find things online.  That <br/>
costs nothing.  There are lots of fun math sites.<br/>

hours myself.<br/>
