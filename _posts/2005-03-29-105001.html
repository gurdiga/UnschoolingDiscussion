Thank you!!!  Years ago, when I was first married and only 19, I taught <br/>
kindrgarten at an unaccredited Christian school in CA.  I had absolutely no <br/>
guidance from the principal or other teachers, so I did everything my own <br/>
way, making it up as I went along.  One of the things I did was make up <br/>
songs to help the children (I had 13 in the group) learn things like days of <br/>
the week or months of the year.  I usually just used familiar tunes because <br/>
I&#39;m only semi-musical (love it but not talented).<br/>
<br/>
I never realized what tune I (almost )used for days of the week until now! <br/>
(A few notes are off, but very similar).  But I only sing it through two <br/>
times, like a verse.  I love it with the chorus included.<br/>
