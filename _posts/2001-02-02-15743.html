&lt;&lt; There is no<br/>
such thing as drinking too much water.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a story told to abnormal-psychology students of a woman whose father <br/>
died and she started drinking water.  She drank water non-stop until she <br/>
drowned because she went past her systems&#39; ability to process, and it got <br/>
into her lungs.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I&#39;m wanting to agree there&#39;s no such thing as drinking too <br/>
much water.<br/>

Technically, that isn&#39;t true. There is such thing as water intoxication, also <br/>
known as hyponatremia. In rare instances, usually with endurance athletes, <br/>
too much water is taken in throwing off the body&#39;s balance of salt and water. <br/>

<br/>
&quot;They call it WATER INTOXICATION or more technically HYPONATREMIA. It happens <br/>
when the body’s balance of salt and water become quickly diluted. It affects <br/>
the production of nerve impulses, and impairs mental processes. Cells take on <br/>
extra water and expand. As they swell, they put stress on the body’s organs, <br/>
particularly the brain, which has little room to expand within the skull. <br/>
Sometimes Hyponatremia is caused by an underlying medical condition. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not an issue most people need to worry about, but still a medical reality.<br/>

Sure there is.  Water intoxication and renal medullary washout are two<br/>
serious consequences.  But, then, in our society that is so dehydrated, it<br/>
would be difficult to do (no, 3 1/2 qts of water a day won&#39;t do it), but<br/>
like anything, too much of a good thing is bad.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in moderation :)<br/>
