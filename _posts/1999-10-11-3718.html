Maybe we can take turns?  Didn&#39;t someone say that once a person&#39;s basic<br/>
needs are met they are in a better position to do things for others?  <br/>

Do you mean husband and wife take turns nurturing each other?<br/>
<br/>
I tossed this question in here because SO many evenings I feel like I NEED<br/>
some nurturing.  And my dh feels this same need....and wants me to nurture<br/>
him!  I sometimes feel drained.....like if I give one more thing before I<br/>
receive some nurturing,  then I may just BURST :-)<br/>
    Anyway,  I suppose taking turns might work- thank you for the<br/>
suggestion, I hadn&#39;t though to try that<br/>
    I have also begun my own self-nurturing,  though it&#39;s difficult to find<br/>
the time.  I&#39;ve decided this has to be Priority!!  I have been getting up<br/>
earlier than everyone else 4-6 mornings a week.  On these mornings I take a<br/>
vigorous 45 min walk.  This is my fifth week.  Some days it&#39;s tough to get<br/>
up and make myself get going.....but my marks on the calendar show me how<br/>
much I&#39;ve accomplished (I track the mileage/days).  I&#39;m finally starting to<br/>
feel stronger.<br/>
    And this week I&#39;m adding focus on eating healthy.  I think these basic<br/>
things make SUCH a difference in energy/attitude.  Wonder why it&#39;s so hard<br/>
(for me) to keep these healthy habits???<br/>

    I found your post very inspiring, I keep trying to motivate myself to get <br/>
up early amd walk. It is so hard to find time in my already busy day. Good <br/>
for you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446066183">Well, there is the ideal & then there is reality.  Sometimes I give when<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I could.  Sometimes I say I&#39;m exhausted & can&#39;t do another<br/>
thing until after a good night&#39;s rest.<br/>
You are so right that we have to nurture ourselves too.  I&#39;m doing more<br/>
for myself now - a monthly book club, using the childcare co-op once in<br/>
awhile just to have a few hours alone, cooking dinners that I like best. <br/>
I&#39;ve learned (at age 41, boy some of us are slow) that people don&#39;t read<br/>
my mind, so I need to tell them what I need.<br/>
Keep up the walking and good eating, Suz.  You deserve it!<br/>
