<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">Hi Amy N. ...</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">the absolute easiest way to learn 
ASL is to take a class from a deaf person!!!&nbsp; second best is to spend time 
w/ deaf people but if this isn&#39;t possible then try to check out ASL video tapes 
from the library b/c most of the videos are too expensive to purchase unless you 
plan to use these&nbsp;long~term ... you&#39;re absolutely right, it&#39;s difficult 
learning ASL from a book b/c it&#39;s a 3-dimensional language ... </font></div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">there is a big diff b/t learning 
signs and actually signing; clear as mud???&nbsp; it cracks me up when I hear 
people saying, &quot;ohhhhh I got an ASL dictionary and Sally knows such and such 
signs (therefore) she&#39;s fluent&quot; ... this makes me laugh b/c there is a big world 
of diff b/t the two statements ... also, if you&#39;re going to learn ASL, as w/ any 
language, you must also learn/understand it&#39;s culture; the two go hand in hand 
...&nbsp; believe me, Deaf culture has a long very involved history but it&#39;s 
very interesting w/ many sad elements, too!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">back to the ASL sentence structure 
...&nbsp; *hearies* (term used by&nbsp;deaf people to describe US) 
rattle~</font><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">rattle~rattle until we&#39;ve 
FINALLY made our point ... not so in the Deaf world, the most impt info MUST be 
given first b/c it could be a matter of life/death; noun, verb, whatever else is 
going on ...&nbsp; for instance, if you&#39;re signing &quot;the baby is crying because 
she is teething&quot; ... prepositions (a, an, the) aren&#39;t used in ASL, so you&#39;d sign 
&quot;baby (pointing), crying, why???, teething, (pointing to baby) she, (nodding 
yes)&quot; ... ugh, I&#39;m not sure this&nbsp;was a very good example but you almost 
have to turn the sentence around in your head, so to speak ... grammatical 
markers are made on your face, for instance when trying to emphasize 
*WHY*???&nbsp; your eyebrows would be raised, your head tilted forward a bit and 
eyes opened wide while looking @ the person you&#39;re signing to ... anyway, ASL is 
a beautiful and very expressive language and it&#39;s not just a bunch of 
disconnected words; it&#39;s an official lang w/ sentence structure, syntax, etc ... 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">Cathy Rice, Ben Behan, Linda Dove 
(Sesame Street lady) are very impt in the Deaf culture, so anything written by 
these people would be a great help (there are a # of other impt people but I 
can&#39;t recall their names @ the moment; bad&nbsp;bad Pris) ... also, a # of great 
videos are available from&nbsp;Garlic Press and the Bravo Video Series: The 
Finger Alphabet, Signing at School, Can I Help?, Caring for Young Children, 
Animal Signs, Pets Animals and Creatures, Mother Goose in Sign, Number and 
Letter Games, Songs in Signs, Foods, Fruits and Vegetables and folk tales, 
Cinderella, several others I can&#39;t think of @ the moment ...&nbsp; all of these 
videos are&nbsp;really terrific but expensive, so borrow/rent if you 
can&nbsp;...</font></div>

<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">... as for teaching sign to your 
little one, *yes*, she&#39;s a perfect age ...&nbsp;&nbsp;deaf people b/g signing to 
their little ones @ birth, just like us hearies talk w/ our 
babies&nbsp;and&nbsp;most CODAs (Children of Deaf Adults) will begin signing @ 
6mths old which is&nbsp;about the same age most hearing babies begin to babble 
(ages are just estimates, of course) ...&nbsp;@ first CODA/deaf babies will use 
one word phrases, just like hearing children&nbsp;and more complicated sentence 
structure the older they get; it&#39;s very interesting and of course, a LOT of 
variable go into this equation!!! &nbsp; I started signing to my babies @ a very 
young age and we were AMAZED @ how much they understood by their 1st b-day; yes, 
mama was *proud*!!!&nbsp; :)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">btw, all of my sign teachers were 
deaf which proved to be an asset!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;*ACK* I was&nbsp;absolutely 
TERRIFIED&nbsp;when I walked into my first intro ASL class but this 
was&nbsp;*WONDERFUL* b/c I was&nbsp; forced to communicate w/ my profs and they 
graciously allowed you to enter their world (I say that w/ a LOT OF LOVE, I 
certainly *hope* this doesn&#39;t sound patronizing or cheesy b/c to this day, it 
always pulled my heartstrings when I think about those wonderful people!!!) ... 
so, if you have the chance to take classes, TRY TO FIND A DEAF TEACHER, I always 
say, learn from the master and you won&#39;t be sorry!!!</font></div>

<div><font color="#008080" face="Comic Sans MS">WELL, Amy N. this was a crash

too, oops, now I can&#39;t find Morgan&#39;s mama&#39;s post, 
ACK!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ohhhhhhhhh,&nbsp;if we were fact~2~face I&#39;d

  <div><br></div>Pris-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved reading your novel :). It&#39;s 
  so sad that you had to get to a point like you did with your childrens&#39; 
  schools to enter homeschooling, but I&#39;m so glad it worked out for you. I read 
  that you are proficient in ASL. I&#39;m really interested in teaching dd ASL and 
  baby signs so we&#39;re better able to communicate before she becomes verbal 
  (she&#39;s fully hearing, BTW). I have board books that give diagrams of the signs 
  (ex. First Book of Animal Signs), but I have such a hard time figuring a lot 
  of them out since I know next to nothing of ASL. Apart from taking a class, 
  are there any resources you could recommend that would help me 
out?<br>TIA<br></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>

Pris-<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much for taking the time to explain a little more about ASL and the deaf culture. It&#39;s absolutely fascinating and probably very misunderstood by most of the hearies. I do understand what you meant by there&#39;s a difference between learning signs and actually signing. It&#39;s even more complicated now after your explanation :).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if there are even any ASL classes in my community (town of 14,000), but I was planning a trip to our library tomorrow so I&#39;ll definitely check out if there are any videos there. &nbsp;I do have a close out of town friend that took classes. Maybe I can beg a little instruction of her.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interest in baby signs started after browsing the book &quot;Baby Signs&quot;, and then I heard from some people that they&#39;ve taught their hearing babies ASL, and I thought &quot;How neat!&quot; I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be much easier just to teach Accalia non-ASL signs, but I think it&#39;s a skill that would benefit all of us throughout life.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you didn&#39;t really confuse me (not too hard to do, though), but you definitely expanded my scope of ASL. It&#39;s a good thing you did that :).<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429194">Pris,<br/>
Thanks for all the great information.  I, too love ASL.   I had a deaf friend <br/>
I met at work, who taught to sign.  I am afraid I have not had a lot of <br/>
oppurtunity to use it in the last 8-9 years.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been teaching some signs to my dd (3) who loves it and wants to know <br/>
the signs for everything.   My ds (1) has signs for shower, bath, bird, up, <br/>
need/want.  He uses these pretty regularly, even though I have not be <br/>
consistant.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of the &quot;Baby Signs&quot; are pretty close to ASL, but my little one <br/>
changes the signs, so he is able to do them---which is okay for now--I get <br/>
what he is saying and he will be able to do them in correct form later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174811122">TOO FUNNY ... when I first read your post I thought you said &quot;My ds (1) has<br/>
SINGS in the shower!!!&quot;  haha, pretty good, just learning to walk and<br/>
SINGING in the shower, too ... *duh* on me ...<br/>
<br/>
my kidos always felt like we were talking in a secret code (I guess we were,<br/>
come to think of it!!!) b/c I made a game out of learning sign ...<br/>
