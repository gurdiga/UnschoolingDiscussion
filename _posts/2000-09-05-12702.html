<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929409370">Amy,<br/>
Thanks for the info. I&#39;ll have to check that out.  It&#39;s kind of funny because <br/>
most of my friends have &quot;bedtime issues&quot; with their kids.  My SIL says they <br/>
play musical beds every night and most nights she ends up on the floor.  My <br/>
best friend and her husband just bought a king size because one or both of <br/>
her kids end up in bed with them.  I just figure stick the kids in bed with <br/>
us from the get go and save the hassle.  It&#39;s where they want to be anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy to have found unschooling.  It seems to fit with my other <br/>
thoughts on parenting.  Something just never seemed right about sending my <br/>
kids off somewhere.  I told the story on the unschooling message board about <br/>
how I tried to put ds in a preschool program last September.  The school is a <br/>
cooperative and I thought it seemed like a really cool place.  I stayed in <br/>
his classroom for a month straight and the staff were fine with that.  Then <br/>
he and I agreed that he would be okay if I waited in the hall(thank goodness <br/>
I have plenty of people to keep dd and that she will stay with just about <br/>
anyone!).  Well, they had to tear him off of my body screaming.  I could hear <br/>
his screams through the door as I waited in the hallway alone.  And I cried <br/>
too. This did not seem right to me.  I do not have to work outside the home <br/>
and I felt there was no reason for me to do this to my child.  Later when the <br/>
kids went outside I watched from the classroom and he seemed okay.  Boy was I <br/>
wrong.  He developed a really bad case of the hives that the doc said was <br/>
nerves.  We took him out of school two weeks later and then he cleared up!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone kept telling me he needs to adjust, he needs to get out of it.  Get <br/>
out of what - being himself?!!  He seems to be thriving being out of school <br/>
and although I have not received &quot;official word&quot; from our school district yet <br/>
as to our start date, I realize  we have been unschooling all along.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this has been long.  It is nice to be around people of like mind.  None <br/>
of my friends or family homeschool.  I did however find a group in my county <br/>
and the first meeting is next week.  Looks like I have lots of support, which <br/>
I think I&#39;ll need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341478710">Amy & Sandy<br/>
<br/>
DH & I have had the kids in bed with us from birth.  As they were <br/>
ready they moved themselves to their own beds.  Every so often one of <br/>
them will come back in & ask to sleep on our floor.  We got out our <br/>
sleeping bags & leave them out for them to use.  DD 7 isn&#39;t in but <br/>
maybe 2 times a month, ds 4 comes in 4-5 times a week & ds 2 stays in <br/>
his crib with the side down. & a toy box (closed) for him to use to <br/>
get out.  He&#39;ll come in during the night to be changed or if he wants <br/>
a drink.  We&#39;ve seen no problems with this.</div>
