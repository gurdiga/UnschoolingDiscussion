<br/>
Yeah.  That&#39;s how we know about unschooling.  But the minute anyone starts <br/>
citing statistics, they&#39;re going to need to be asked to stop, because there is <br/>
no way to get clear and good statistics.  Too many unschoolers are not here on <br/>
this list, nor even (horrors!) online!  Most aren&#39;t registered to homeschool, <br/>
I don&#39;t think, and I&#39;m basing &quot;most&quot; on knowing lots of states don&#39;t have <br/>
registration requirements, and of those that do I bet few to none register as <br/>
&quot;unschoolers who aren&#39;t going to teach their kids those things the state wants <br/>
homeschoolers to teach&quot; (and knowing that large numbers just don&#39;t register <br/>
whether it&#39;s required by the state or not).<br/>
<br/>
So there aren&#39;t going to be scientific measures yet, for a long time, if <br/>
ever, about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Like, &quot;Gut-knowledge is crap.&quot;  I still have a gut-knowledge that NF&#39;s are <br/>
more likely to unschool.  It just fits.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then all you have to do is qualify your statement and say &quot;I think ... <br/>
because...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I believe in gut knowledge.  And I know lots of nonsense can be &quot;proven&quot; with <br/>
statistics.<br/>
<br/>
But still, it&#39;s important to qualify what people say to keep it all true.<br/>
