<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093518782">Random mutterings about current rumblings -<br/>
<br/>
**Cindy - that was a comment for Teri, not you.**<br/>
<br/>
Comment for the rest of the list, not this poster who is on her way out the <br/>
door anyway - if you really mean a comment to be for one person only, please <br/>
please please don&#39;t post it to the list, send it by private email. It&#39;s <br/>
incredibly rude to carry on a private conversation in a crowded room like <br/>
this and expect people not to join in. <br/>
<br/>
**Just keep moving in the unschooling direction!**<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes, but newcomers and especially those who don&#39;t intend to become <br/>
unschoolers but only to borrow ideas and energy ought not to be encouraged to <br/>
offer advice antithetical to unschooling on an unschooling list. If folks are <br/>
here for ideas they might want to listen awhile before telling the oldtimers <br/>
they&#39;re doing it all wrong. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling except for math or unschooling except requiring writing isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling. It&#39;s thinking about unschooling, admiring unschooling, playing <br/>
around with unschooling, wading, but it&#39;s not unschooling, and calling it <br/>
that just confuses people. <br/>
<br/>
If I eat vegetarian meals every day but Saturday, I&#39;m not a vegetarian, and <br/>
I&#39;m only being dishonest with myself to say I am.<br/>

And a statement that we had to sit down and work out some quantitative<br/>
guidelines together.   I have since been told that:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I am not unschooling <br/>
2.  I am being dishonest with my kids (even though they know what I do)<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t belong on this list<br/>
4.  That I am telling YOU that you are doing it wrong.  (Ihaven&#39;t said<br/>
word one about what I think of what YOU are doing.)  <br/>
5.  In a round about way, that I don&#39;t offer my kids enough options. <br/>
(even when I was bedridden, they had TONS of options.  My girls used<br/>
them, my son did not.)<br/>
6.  That I did not do what I said I would when I joined which was: &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
listen for a day or two before I jump all over you all!&quot;  I never said I<br/>
would not talk or throw out my thoughts in general.  I said I would not<br/>
jump all over you.  I haven&#39;t . . . yet.  Well, mostly, the quote from<br/>
unschooling.com may have been close.<br/>
