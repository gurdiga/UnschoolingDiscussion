<div id="ygrps-yiv-736915746">One of the mantras I repeat at home is:<br/>
<br/>
Coercion breeds subversion.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are repeatedly told what to do and when at the expense of their own internal <br/>
logic either become complacent rule followers to appease their imposing superiors or they <br/>
become adept &quot;beat the system&quot; subverts and rule breakers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m repeatedly amazed at how willing teens are to lie, cheat, avoid, and ignore the rules <br/>
handed down to them. I am not exaggerating. Even kids whose reputations are &quot;pure gold&quot; <br/>
in terms of grades and popularity all know how to beat &quot;the system&quot; (home or school) <br/>
when they need to.<br/>
<br/>
Each time we use our power or authority to compell someone against that person&#39;s will, we <br/>
are damaging the relationship. There may be times when we intervene or compell based <br/>
on physical danger (toddler runs into the street and we chase her down and literally <br/>
remove her from oncoming traffic), but in nine times out of ten cases, our need to compell <br/>
our kids to &quot;do&quot; something is motivated by our own needs (to think we are schooling <br/>
them, teaching the hygiene, are responsible parents - not losers like we fear others will <br/>
think we are, fear that our kids are not normal or will fail).<br/>
<br/>
My advice: find something to learn and od for yourswelf. Get busy and happy and have <br/>
things to do that make your life so exciting to live that you stop worrying about your <br/>
daughter&#39;s life. Your enthusaism for learning will be contagious if you are learning and not <br/>
teaching or compelling.<br/>
<br/>
Julie B<br/>
<br/>
P.S. And about those pesky times tables... I didn&#39;t finish learning mine until this year when <br/>
someone on this list wrote: 5, 6, 7, 8 and said it was a trick for learning 7x8. My life <br/>
changed, I tell you! I have never had certainty about 7x8 and have always used calculators <br/>
to compensate for multiplication.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I just celebrated my five year anniversary as a business owner and have served over <br/>
1000 families. Not hurting me so far. &lt;g&gt;</div>

I don&#39;t see it much in the unschooled teens I know.<br/>
One admitted in a blog to having made cheat notes for a college math  test.<br/>
Others?  Pretty straightforward as far as I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby has lot of friends who are honest but I don&#39;t see them in school or  <br/>
family-of-origin surroundings, just at my house or public places.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of their in-school teen friends, though, are neaky liars, but the  <br/>
sneaking seems to have to do with school and parents.   Then again,  for a lot of <br/>
teens all they have in their lives are school and parents, and the  desire to <br/>
get away from one or both of those.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I should have clarified that I meant kids who were in &quot;systems of coercion&quot; (whether it be <br/>
school or parents). That was my point really - that kids who live in those coercive contexts <br/>
are the ones I know who are more likely to &quot;bend the rules&quot; and really think little of it than <br/>
kids who are making choices for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My son recently sent me to his blog to read a recent entry entitled: Mom this is not your <br/>
fault.<br/>
<br/>
In it he shared at length a choice he made that he regretted. As I read, I kept thinking, <br/>
&quot;What teen in his right mind would want to share this with his mother?&quot; But that was what <br/>
struck me. He wanted me to know. He wanted me to know because he has not had any <br/>
reason to hide things from me (or from my husband).<br/>
<br/>
His choices are his and I am one of his support systems.<br/>

<br/>
One of my daughter&#39;s friend&#39;s life is a long plot to disobey her parents&#39; abusive rules. And <br/>
while I actually appalud her chutzpah for not letting their sickness ruin her life, I do worry <br/>
for her because she has to lead such a double life in order not to be completely dominated <br/>
by them that I wonder how much damage to her own consciense she is doing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an extreme example, but I see so many little deceptions in the public schooled kids <br/>
my kids know that it breaks my heart.<br/>

Those typos and grammatical mistakes stand corrected below:<br/>

applaud her chutzpah for not letting her parents&#39; sickness ruin her life. However, I do <br/>
worry for her anyway. I wonder what kind of damage to this girl&#39;s conscience results when <br/>

I&#39;d be tempted to tell her &quot;I know your parents have been wrong about <br/>

=========<br/>
 <br/>
But she shouldn&#39;t be looking to her parents about what is right, wrong,  <br/>
right or good. They&#39;ve broken the bond of trust.<br/>
 <br/>
If she finds other adult role models who might sometimes agree with her  <br/>
parents and sometimes not, she&#39;ll be working from more than one source and not  <br/>
just being resistent and reactive.<br/>

&gt; &quot;P.S. And about those pesky times tables... I didn&#39;t finish learning mine<br/>
&gt; until this year when<br/>
&gt; someone on this list wrote: 5, 6, 7, 8 and said it was a trick for<br/>
learning<br/>
&gt; 7x8.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I missed this trick, can you show me!?<br/>

In case  you haven&#39;t read it, a fairy puts a spell on Ella at birth.  She <br/>
