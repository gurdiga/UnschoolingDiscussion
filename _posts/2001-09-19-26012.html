see the first post.  Also, some of what I write isn&#39;t showing up (unless it&#39;s<br/>
going through a long delay).<br/>
<br/>
Are there glitches with the list?<br/>

<br/>
Linda, you feel someone is reading the messages first and allowing on<br/>
certain ones to go through?<br/>
<br/>
 I can assure you that for Helen dealing with her father&#39;s stroke and my own<br/>
husband on Reserve standby and my own father bedridden, neither of the two<br/>
listed moderators have the time or energy for such an undertaking. I&#39;ve been<br/>
updating our will and getting my dh to create a general power of attorney.<br/>
Frankly, I&#39;m appalled at how uncharacteristically juvenile this list has<br/>
become.<br/>
<br/>
Helen and I are listed as *moderators* at yahoogroups. We help folks sub and<br/>
unsub.  We maintain the admin duties at yahoo. If you take the time to visit<br/>
that webpage you will see that in the description of this list it states we<br/>
are an unmoderated list. I simply couldn&#39;t get yahoo to list that aspect as<br/>
different from what it really is. Yahoo doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>
<br/>
If you are having mail that isn&#39;t going through, then your right there with<br/>
the rest of us.  Yesterday some of my mail took 8 hours to make it to a<br/>
list.<br/>

I&#39;m on 2 different email list servers and they both have trouble sending out<br/>
all the mail all the time. Sometimes it&#39;s more noticable.<br/>
<br/>
There doesn&#39;t seem to be a specific pattern to whose gets delivered to who.<br/>
It would seem that since Yahoo is forwarding it would all be in the digest<br/>
but it isn&#39;t. AOL people tend to have the most missed mail but even that<br/>
isn&#39;t consistent.<br/>

of your posts, so I do know at least that one made it to me.  Email is not<br/>

<br/>
Dear Unschooling list group,<br/>
<br/>
I have been deleting alot of mail lately, as I am in no mood to take the<br/>
time<br/>
to sign onto my computer and find people bashing people. Please take<br/>
your cutting down of others privately and off this list.<br/>
If I wanted to read junk, I would send my son back to PS, and attend IEP<br/>
meetings<br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
GROW UP!<br/>
I use this list for information and direction, not to open a piece of mail<br/>
and<br/>
be a included on this yucky party line.<br/>
