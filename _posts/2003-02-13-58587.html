<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is scary stuff. My kids would be scared to leave home, not knowing <br/>
what would be gone next.  After reading more on their web site I would <br/>
guess the tv and computer.<br/>
<br/>
I like this line:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If you are looking for support and information on home and/or <br/>
&gt; un-schooling based on a Waldorf Inspired Curriculum, you have come to the <br/>
&gt; right place!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the official answers are given by a Ph.D. My father has a Ph.D. in <br/>
education and spent just about zip-all time interacting with his kids.<br/>
