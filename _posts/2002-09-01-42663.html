<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366348422">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where to begin here.  I want to introduce myself, and I<br/>
feel the need to tell you a little bit of my history.  Please forgive<br/>
me if I ramble and sound a bit melodramatic!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Robin and I have two little ones.  My dd is age 5 and my ds<br/>
is 2.5. We live in Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
I almost sent my dd to kindergarten this year, but couldn&#39;t follow<br/>
through. First of all, something just didn&#39;t feel right to me about<br/>
leaving her in the hands of people that I don&#39;t know.  I even went to<br/>
the main office and requested to interview my daughter&#39;s teacher to<br/>
be.  Of course, you can imagine the response!  I guess the irony of it<br/>
all is that I *am* a teacher( secondary English/psychology).  I knew<br/>
*better* than to even ask the question...but some voice inside me just<br/>
blurted it out anyway. <br/>
<br/>
You see, I went into &quot;the field&quot; because I wanted to make a<br/>
difference.  I thought that the *ways* of the system were flawed<br/>
(objectives, methodologies); and the college that I attended, I<br/>
thought, addressed these flaws.  My professors challenged the concept<br/>
of standardized testing.  Emplement creative alternatives to testing,<br/>
they said.  Access student personal experience...make what you teach<br/>
*relevant*. Give a purpose that is meaningful to the lives of your<br/>
students. Portfolio learning.  Cooperative learning.  Learning across<br/>
curriculum. Creativity. I was excited.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I became pregnant.  Other than a year in &quot;the system&quot; working as<br/>
a teacher&#39;s assistant while I was pregnant, I, well, kind of forgot<br/>
about it....my life went in another direction.  My short experience in<br/>
the school system was disappointing, and I hoped my experience was a<br/>
fluke....surely things weren&#39;t that bad everywhere?<br/>
<br/>
So, here I am walking under the &quot;golden arches&quot; called &quot;school of<br/>
excellence&quot; at my dds soon to be elementary school; and I think, &quot;This<br/>
will be okay.  This is a beautiful school.  Surely they are a<br/>
portfolio; purposeful, relevent minded; cooperative, creative kind of<br/>
place!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 I am invited to observe in my dd&#39;s future Kindergarten teacher&#39;s<br/>
class, and my hopeful bubble is politely, but quickly burst.  Words<br/>
like stressful and SOLs (Standards of Learning) are used. No time for<br/>
&quot;one-on-one;&quot; no time for a nurturing environment.  One fourth of the<br/>
class were &quot;held back&quot; before ever starting school to make sure they<br/>
were *ready*, I&#39;m told. Then, on my way out, I see a pile of papers in<br/>
the handwriting of these children in this classroom, who had copied<br/>
sentences from off the board.... and one with red marks all over it. <br/>
That image is stuck in my mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so we&#39;re not going back; and I&#39;m left wondering what happened in<br/>
the schools....I was so hopeful...I thought by now....the &quot;ways&quot; of<br/>
the system....  It wasn&#39;t until I joined a local homeschool chat group<br/>
that I even began to think that it wasn&#39;t the &quot;ways&#39; of the system,<br/>
but the *system itself*.... and, that I might just be &quot;bringing it all<br/>
home,&quot; so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I&#39;m here wanting to unschool (think I&#39;m the one that needs the<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; though...my dd pretty much knows how). I hope I haven&#39;t<br/>
annoyed you all to much with my ramblings....It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been<br/>
through such a shift in consciousness in just a few months, and I<br/>
guess I&#39;m trying to dump it all here and re-arrange.  HOpe you don&#39;t<br/>
mind helping *me* unschool!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
Robin</div>

Reading Gatto&#39;s &quot;UNderground History,&quot; as well.  Think I understand (live <br/>
life fully and learning  as they go...like offering a smorgesbord ?), but its <br/>
the fear of letting go and trusting.  I managed to do this regarding the <br/>
infant, toddler development stuff...couldn&#39;t follow &quot;the book, &quot; so threw it <br/>
out, if that makes sense. But, now I do feel pressure to perform and for dd <br/>
to perform ( mostly from dh, but a part of me, as well).<br/>

As a new unschooler, it has been very helpful for me to rad a lot about unschooling and to really observe my kids. I like Teach Your Own by John Holt, the whole unschooling.com message  boards :-), Childs Work by Nancy  Wallace, amongst others. Keeping an occasional journal/log was also helpful - I could look back and see where my kids had been, exoerience  and learning wise, that is...Leonie W. <br/>

there is quite a bit of info out there.  Kinda overwhelmed with it all, so <br/>
specific suggestions do help.    The journal/log sounds like a good idea.  <br/>
I&#39;ll just have to remember to keep it simple, or I will go overboard with it <br/>
and burn out...every little detail kind of person!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433206567">Welcome Robin!<br/>
<br/>
What a better opportunity to suggest this month&#39;s Home Education <br/>
Magazine --it is all about not going back to school. Sandra has an <br/>
article about deschooling and my contribution is &quot;Taking the School <br/>
out of Homeschool&quot;. So many people contributed their stories for this <br/>
article that the wisdom in it is really from the homeschooling <br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
And what is that wisdom, you may ask? That homeschooling, <br/>
unschooling, deschooling, is a process that the parents HAVE TO go <br/>
through as much as their children. So, yes, welcome to the newbie <br/>
section (I am a newbie as well). Just sit back an enjoy the <br/>
deschooling ride.<br/>
