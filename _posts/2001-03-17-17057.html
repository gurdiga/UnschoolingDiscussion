&gt;Girls Inc. in Sioux City, IA. Are holding classes during the month of<br/>
&gt;May.<br/>
&gt;The 8 week session of classes for 10-11 year old is focusing on Inner<br/>
&gt;vs.<br/>
&gt;Outer beauty. They will be taking a values survey and completing a<br/>
&gt;body<br/>
&gt;image checklist. Then the girls will examine advertisements from<br/>
&gt;magazines<br/>
&gt;and analyze the magazine&#39;s message about body image. The girls will<br/>
&gt;write<br/>
&gt;some letters to the editors, etc. They will use the Internet, several<br/>
&gt;websites have projects where they put ads online to analyze regarding<br/>
&gt;body<br/>
&gt;image and society&#39;s portrayal of beauty. The girls will also examine<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;own personal inner beauty and will be involved in several related<br/>
&gt;activities. They will talk about eating disorders and other ways women<br/>
&gt;hurt<br/>
&gt;themselves trying to achieve what they believe is the &quot;perfect body.&quot;<br/>
