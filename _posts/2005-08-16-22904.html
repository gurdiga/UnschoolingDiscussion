<br/>
My son is 6 and is going through vision therapy.  It is important for<br/>
him to do his &quot;homework,&quot; as they call it, 5 days a week. <br/>
Unfortunately, we were just settling into unschooling, and I was<br/>
finally feeling like we had some sense of family balance and harmony.<br/>
 Now, though, it feels like it is all going down the tubes because we<br/>
have to get certain things done everyday - and the activities are<br/>
challenging for him, and sometimes not all that fun.  We have to do<br/>
basically 4 activities for 8 minutes a peice.  What should take a<br/>
little over half an hour takes us what feels like forever!  He is<br/>
miserable and doesn&#39;t want to do anything now.  I was seeing so much<br/>
learning and excitement happening for him when we finally relaxed and<br/>
let him do his thing!  <br/>
<br/>
This is really frustrating because if we don&#39;t do the Vision Therapy,<br/>
he may never be able to see normally.  If we keep doing it the way<br/>
it&#39;s assigned, I am really worried about how my son will do in the<br/>
rest of his life!  Help!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Does he understand that?  (I don&#39;t know how old he  is.)<br/>
 <br/>
Can you modify the schedule to his tolerance level?  It  sounds like physical <br/>
exercises to me?  I&#39;ll tell you something I&#39;ve learned  for myself when it <br/>
comes to exercising...if I don&#39;t like it, I won&#39;t do  it.  If it&#39;s too hard for <br/>
my fitness level, I won&#39;t do it.  If it  feels wrong, I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>
 <br/>
So what I do is do just what I&#39;m going to do for as long as  I&#39;m going to do <br/>
it, and refuse to feel guilty if I don&#39;t follow someone else&#39;s  &quot;advice&quot; or <br/>
schedule or idea of what I should be doing.  Doing it my way is  better than not <br/>
doing it all.  Sure, it&#39;s not as effective as quickly as  staying on a <br/>
rigorous schedule.  But I don&#39;t have any goals to meet, except  the principles of <br/>
good health.  I&#39;m not training for a  marathon.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d bet the eye doctor who is prescribing the vision therapy  is thinking in <br/>
terms of being able to do school work.  He&#39;s probably  thinking if your son <br/>
doesn&#39;t improve now, he won&#39;t be able to see  the blackboard in 4th grade.  I&#39;m <br/>
not saying your son shouldn&#39;t be able to  see well, but does he need that kind <br/>
of pressure if he&#39;s unschooling?  He&#39;s  not training for the marathon of <br/>
school.  <br/>
 <br/>
After I talked to the doctor about what could happen if you  backed off (and <br/>
researched it on the internet so you&#39;d know if there were other  options), I&#39;d <br/>
just back off and let your son do it at his own pace, if he thinks  it&#39;s a <br/>
good idea and wants to see better.  Rarely is anything a &quot;do or die&quot;  situation <br/>
in the average childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364280402">I&#39;ve personally done vision therapy, although I don&#39;t know if the exercises<br/>
your son has to do are similar to what I had to do...<br/>
<br/>
The time I first did them I wasn&#39;t able to do one particular exercise at<br/>
all.  It was a 3D thing.  No matter how much I tried, my brain/eyes just<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it.  It was incredibly frustrating, and I was an adult.  Even<br/>
the doctor got frustrated.  Usually he had assistants do the exercises when<br/>
I had my visit, but after more than a month of no progress he started to do<br/>
them with me - it was almost as if he couldn&#39;t believe it and had to see<br/>
for himself.  I remember feeling totally inadequate because I just couldn&#39;t<br/>
tell which stupid sheep was closer to bo peep!!  Then one day all of a<br/>
sudden it jumped out at me and I was able to do the exercise.  It took a<br/>
lot of determination for me to stick with it.  I&#39;m glad I did, because it<br/>
helped me with my vision immensely.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a 6yo being able to do what I did to stick with it.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t fun, it was frustrating.  But, having the vision difficulties in my<br/>
life was more frustrating, so I was willing to do the work.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few years ago I did them again because I was noticing that I had<br/>
gone back to some older habits.  The 3D exercise was totally easy, but some<br/>
of the others were difficult again.  What this 2nd doctor said was that I<br/>
could do the exercises at my own pace, but that the improvements would come<br/>
sooner if I did the exercises every day.  In a way it was all about how<br/>
quickly I wanted to see the changes and how many visits I wanted to pay<br/>
for.  The more &quot;homework&quot; I did, the fewer visits I would have.  You might<br/>
want to see if this would also be true for your son&#39;s program.  If so, then<br/>
take a slower pace.<br/>
<br/>
And I suggest that you find out exactly what the parameters are for &quot;having<br/>
to&quot; do the Vision Therapy.  I did mine when I was in my early 20s.  Not to<br/>
say that his issues aren&#39;t urgent and need correcting, but exactly when<br/>
will it be too late and why??  Maybe it isn&#39;t as urgent as it might seem.<br/>
I&#39;m going to guess that the urgency isn&#39;t so much about the health of the<br/>
child or some technical medical reason -- but more about how he&#39;ll need to<br/>
have the vision corrected before he will be able to read... and well...<br/>
there&#39;s no need to rush that!!  Maybe I&#39;m wrong, maybe some visioning<br/>
pattern will be set in place that will hard to correct if his vision isn&#39;t<br/>
fixed early on...  I&#39;d find out.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son needed VT, still does, but he was and is unwilling to spend the <br/>
time it takes to do the exercises. It is something we&#39;ve discussed. He <br/>
does not want to do it and I&#39;m not willing to spend the $$$$$$$$ the <br/>
Drs. charge for something that will make all of us miserable. Even if it <br/>
will help him read and write better. This is something you can come back <br/>
to when he is older and ready. It is something he can choose to do as a <br/>
teen or adult. It really is not a &quot;do it all now or he&#39;ll never improve&quot; <br/>
kinda thing. You could get a book like &quot;Eyes on Track&quot; and see if there <br/>
is any exercises in there that your son wants to do each day and just do <br/>
that until he&#39;s ready to continue VT.<br/>
See this is where unschooling and an unschooling lifestyle gets tough <br/>
for me. Josh (13) really needs to wear glasses (or contacts) but he <br/>
refuses to do it. It is just for one eye. Contacts are too &quot;hard to put <br/>
in&quot; even with smaller ones. Glasses are &quot;uncomfortable&quot;...no kidding? <br/>
I&#39;ve worn them for about 35 years. So he does without and he really has <br/>
a hard time reading and writing, but he is not interested in doing <br/>
anything about it, I read things for him, but he does get frustrated <br/>
with the wait times, but he does not want to try anything to help and <br/>
well it is just a vicious cycle. Hmmmm, I sound grouchy this morning. <br/>
Need more tea.<br/>

week. Unfortunately, we were just settling into unschooling, and I <br/>
was finally feeling like we had some sense of family balance and <br/>
harmony.    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both my son and daughter were evaluated by a vision therapist. We <br/>
were just beginning our unschooling journey after homeschooling for <br/>
a few years. We were definitely not whole-life unschooling yet. I <br/>
mention this because if I were in the same situation today I <br/>
probably would not even have them evaluated at all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. . . . <br/>
<br/>
I had heard about vision therapy from my SIL. The reason I had my <br/>
son evaluated was because he hated reading at 10 - he had learned to <br/>
read in school - he went through 2nd grade. I just couldn&#39;t get<br/>
how someone could hate reading and I was worried. . . . <br/>
<br/>
I was lucky because our vision therapist was a homeschooler (she had <br/>
her practice 2.5 days a week and her husband did whatever he did for <br/>
2.5 days). I let her know that we didn&#39;t do formal lessons and<br/>
that I wasn&#39;t pushing academics. <br/>
<br/>
My son had focusing problems and double vision (neither of which was <br/>
caught in the regular eye exams he had had) and maybe a couple other <br/>
things - can&#39;t remember now. She recommended either exercises or <br/>
glasses for &quot;close work&quot;. He chose the glasses and wore them<br/>
for about a year - mostly while playing Legos. I&#39;m sure I was a<br/>
nag about wearing them since we hadn&#39;t reached whole-life <br/>
unschooling nirvana yet.  &lt;g&gt;  After that year he was evaluated and <br/>
all his vision issues were gone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had my daughter evaluated when she was 6 or maybe 7 because I <br/>
heard that the vision problems could be hereditary.  Since our <br/>
therapist knew I wasn&#39;t concerned about early reading she<br/>
suggested exercises to improve focus (and other things but I<br/>
can&#39;t remember what they were either  sorry) but not to push.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Now, though, it feels like it is all going down the tubes <br/>
because we have to get certain things done everyday - and the <br/>
activities are challenging for him, and sometimes not all that fun. <br/>
We have to do basically 4 activities for 8 minutes a peice. What <br/>
should take a little over half an hour takes us what feels like <br/>
forever! He is miserable and doesn&#39;t want to do anything now.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yup  that is exactly what happened here. The exercises lasted<br/>
about 3 days. We never did them again.<br/>
<br/>
Madelyn had two or three evaluations about a year apart and each <br/>
showed improvement. The last one, when she was maybe 11 or 12, <br/>
showed that she had no vision problems. The vision therapist had <br/>
suggested that she would probably outgrow the problems and she did.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  This is really frustrating because if we don&#39;t do the Vision <br/>
Therapy, he may never be able to see normally.   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could let it go for a year and have him evaluated again. <br/>
If you don&#39;t feel comfortable with that or if your son is<br/>
expressing distress about his vision, at least get a second opinion <br/>
from a therapist who understands that reading at 6 and doing <br/>
schoolwork aren&#39;t top priorities for you.<br/>
<br/>
Mercedes<br/>
who just read this response to Madelyn and she says it was alot <br/>
longer than three days  :-(</div>
