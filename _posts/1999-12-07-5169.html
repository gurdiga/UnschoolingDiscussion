<br/>
Who Knows<br/>
<br/>
I enter the Ring. My grip on my scepter is tight, ready to fight. I frown,<br/>
Thinking of everyone that has forgotten me, or hates me. I narrow my blue<br/>
eyes,<br/>
my blond hair in meatballs. I think maybe if I look evil I can win. But<br/>
Deep down I know it&#39;s not true. I start to remember the Loved ones that<br/>
want me to come back. Then I shake my head saying &quot;no&quot; over and over again.<br/>
I can&#39;t give in, not now, not ever.. I can do this. I take a deep breath in<br/>
and close my eyes, what will happen if I can&#39;t survive? Will my enemies be<br/>
happy, or will my friends?  Nor will the Loved ones be glom or dead. I<br/>
can&#39;t tell which way to go. I just feel the hot sting of tears and my<br/>
scepter in my hand. I open my eyes and look around the ring, to see no one<br/>
standing behind me. No one for backup. I&#39;m all alone, again. I think. Then<br/>
there it sits at far corner of the ring. I walk up to it. My heeled boots<br/>
clinking as I take steps. I pick it up to see it just disappears. I fall<br/>
to my knees crying. &quot;Love or Death&quot; I repeat over in my head. I can&#39;t take<br/>
this any more. There&#39;s no happiness in my life. What&#39;s going to happen if I<br/>
don&#39;t survive? I close my eyes again, letting my scepter fall to the ground.<br/>
Then I feel the darkness take the friendship of others away from me. I<br/>
breathe in deeply, and then open my eyes to see I cannot survive or breathe. I<br/>
scream. Nothing comes out. I look over at my scepter. Glowing bright just<br/>
like my heart deep down inside. I can survive, I can make it. I slowly start<br/>
to breathe again. I stand up and grab my scepter and look around to see<br/>
everyone that cares.. Loves. And hates me behind me ready to help. I<br/>
smile thinking I can survive. Just as long as you&#39;re on my side.<br/>
