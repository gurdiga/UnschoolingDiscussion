Jeez, the whole thing started as sort of a joke.  It was supposed to be lighthearted, but obviously I worded it a little heavier than I thought.  I think a lot of the main stream &quot;experts&quot; are quacks, but they sell a lot of books and get on TV so someone must be listening.  I&#39;m just not one of them.<br/>

Some people &quot;become experts&quot; by doing no more than going through school doing <br/>
half-ass work and not understanding it, really.   It think anyone who went to <br/>
school at ANY level, up to grad school, knows there are people like that.   <br/>
And knowing that, then just a piece of paper doesn&#39;t make &#39;an expert.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
When someone really does know and care about a subject, what I respect is the <br/>
cool ideas he or she has and the way in which they&#39;re expressed.  If a person <br/>
can make a subject really accessible and fascinating to others, then that&#39;s <br/>
something to care about.  Lots of times those people have college degrees or <br/>
years in the field, but sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes someone is new to something and comes up with an incredible <br/>
insight that changes the lives around them and changes the knowledge base of <br/>
experts, who go back to their drawing boards and research and change what they <br/>
thought they knew.<br/>
<br/>
But anyone, whether a college student or doctoral candidate or ten year old, <br/>
who trusts one source instead of waiting/thinking/trying/looking further, is <br/>
not doing much thinking, is doing NO research, and is not (in my opinion) <br/>
earning trust or faith.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that something to argue against?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any field which consists of all upright and competent <br/>
practitioners.  I don&#39;t believe there is any degree field in which someone <br/>
hasn&#39;t pretty much bluffed or lucked or finagled into a degreed position.<br/>
<br/>
-=-      Maybe this is one of those things you find has to be overstated to <br/>
be <br/>
heard through hser expert awe?-=-<br/>
<br/>
No more than any other truism that people will accept without reflection.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My experience has been more the opposite -- <br/>
hsers (and parents generally) tending to dismiss ideas and to trash experts <br/>
and <br/>

listening or thinking. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you have examples of times when parents have trashed experts because <br/>
they&#39;re experts, regardless of what their positions/advice included?<br/>
<br/>
There are &quot;reading experts&quot; who have never taught a child to read.  There are <br/>
reading experts who have never even TRIED to teach a child to read.  But <br/>
they&#39;ve read a lot of &quot;studies&quot; and can recite the names of lots of &quot;disorders&quot; <br/>
and can talk about what research was popular in which decade and what has been <br/>
found not to work.  They won&#39;t add the current cutting edge theories, though.  <br/>
People in ten or fifteen years will include today&#39;s theories in those that <br/>
didn&#39;t work.  So what&#39;s the value of reading experts in general, as a field?<br/>
<br/>
Some fields of expertise are somewhat bogus in and of themselves.  Some come <br/>
and go.  MAYBE there&#39;s value, but they&#39;re seen as dubious fields.  Phrenology, <br/>
for example.   UFO research.   Creation Science.   <br/>
<br/>
Helpful information can come from unexpected sources.  Bullshit can come from <br/>
PhDs.  Then how is a person to decide?<br/>
<br/>
Examination of the ideas, trying them out in real situations, seeing if they <br/>
seem workable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s an observation that many people tend to want to trust rather than<br/>
understand for themselves. They see that something is written by an expert<br/>
and trust what follows rather than trying to figure out if it&#39;s true or not.<br/>
<br/>
And some experts -- and all self-styled experts -- take advantage of the<br/>
fact of human nature that it&#39;s easier to impress people than to educate<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a poke at all experts. It&#39;s a two barbed joking observation on the<br/>
people who trust experts blindly and on &quot;experts&quot; that take advantage of<br/>
that.<br/>
