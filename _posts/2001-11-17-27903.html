<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986979117">You know, I just can&#39;t take any more of this juvenile, junior high stuff anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Has it occured to any of the people who have jumped on the Sandra bandwagon that she was not attacked in any way, has scared off several newcomers (myself included, this is my last post before I unsub, and I wonder how many lurkers who were just here to research unschooling have been turned off completely?) and has managed to turn at least 2 different threads into personal ego strokes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been holding my opinions in, and have felt like I have to re-write every post several times, clarify any possible points of confusion, make only &quot;I&quot; statements, never generalize in any way.  This is the most oppressive board I&#39;ve ever been on.   On the radical unschooling board, a mother mentioned recently in passing that she monitors her children&#39;s tv viewing, I was waiting for a firestorm, then realized that this is the difference between a functional community and a non-functional one, the ability to state opinions without fear of reprisal.  I&#39;m sorry to have to leave here, and there are a few voices that I will miss, but I&#39;ve only been here a few weeks, and I find myself disgusted with the behavior of some people here.  I find myself hurt or angry by almost every post (and it takes a LOT to rile me.)  I&#39;m on other boards with many different kinds of people, including fundamentalists christians, who have not displayed the judgemental, arrogant, narcissistic behavior I&#39;ve seen here.  I&#39;m going back to the &quot;rigid&quot; hs boards where I can actually speak my mind for once.<br/>

Goodbye.<br/>

  Great analogy, Sandra.<br/>
  I, for one, appreciate reading your thoughts and opinions on various <br/>
  topics, unschooling or not.<br/>
  (Is anything NOT related in some way to unschooling?)<br/>
  My 2 cents.<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I would hope that discussions about unschooling would be heavily <br/>
  involved <br/>
  &gt; with point making.  I really think discussions of people with <br/>
  opinions they <br/>
  &gt; can back up are more valuable than just idle chit chat with no <br/>
  intent to <br/>
  &gt; inform or influence others in the discussion.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think some people are more comfortable with &quot;discussions&quot; that go <br/>
  this way:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Have you seen the news of Aghanistan?<br/>
  &gt; A bird is in the yard!<br/>
  &gt; Yes, the sun just came out.<br/>
  &gt; My son hates to read.<br/>
  &gt; We love our new church.<br/>
  &gt; When I was little we lived near a church.<br/>
  &gt; The bird is splashing in the water.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; No disagreements.<br/>
  &gt; Also no information, and no learning.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; And I think there are people who would love for online discussions <br/>
  to all be <br/>
  &gt; this way:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &quot;I keep my child from wearing red because it disturbs me and I&#39;m <br/>
  sure it <br/>
  &gt; would eventually disturb him, and if I let him wear red, I know he <br/>
  would wear <br/>
  &gt; nothing but red every day for the rest of his life.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;You&#39;re such a good mom!&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Nobody knows your son like you do.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll stop letting my son wear red too.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;What about daughters?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;How old was he when you realized wearing red was the source of all <br/>
  his <br/>
  &gt; learning problems?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;What about pink?  Maroon?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Your son is so lucky to have you as a mom!&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;I wish I had kept my son from wearing red.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Red is the color of Satan, so you&#39;re intuitively a good mom and <br/>
  your child <br/>
  &gt; will live forever.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Red sets up a vibration of agitation, but there is an aromatherapy <br/>
  antidote.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;I&#39;m so glad I came here to discuss this!&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &quot;Yes, I love these deep, heartfelt discussions.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think when a person goes so far  as to take children out of <br/>
  school AND they <br/>
  &gt; reject the nicely packaged curriculum and traditional schedule and <br/>
  behaviors <br/>
  &gt; AND they have found unschooling.com (which I realize some on this <br/>
  list still <br/>
  &gt; have not, but it&#39;s there, nevertheless, and I hope it&#39;s listed on <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt; yahoogroups main page for this list), they are probably ready to <br/>
  REALLY <br/>
  &gt; honestly discuss things of importance to their children&#39;s futures.  <br/>
  And lots <br/>
  &gt; of people here and on the forum are unhappy and scared and on the <br/>
  verge of <br/>
  &gt; giving up unschooling so they can&#39;t get it.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; We can be la-la supportive of bad ideas along with the good.  We <br/>
  can send <br/>
  &gt; them elsewhere for real information.  Or we can discuss issues and <br/>
  compare <br/>
  &gt; results and offer alternatives and options and we can brainstorm.  <br/>
  Learning <br/>
  &gt; doesn&#39;t take place as well in a still, quiet, near-sleep state as <br/>
  it does in <br/>
  &gt; a more active, aroused, alert state.  <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If a person has NO new thoughts to think, no new phases for their <br/>
  children to <br/>
  &gt; pass through, no questions whatsoever about hobbies or resources or <br/>
  &gt; unschooling practicalities, then they don&#39;t need the opinions they <br/>
  can find <br/>
  &gt; here.  Maybe they just came to chat.  If by chat they mean &quot;be <br/>
  totally <br/>
  &gt; supported and never questioned,&quot; they just came to the wrong list.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
