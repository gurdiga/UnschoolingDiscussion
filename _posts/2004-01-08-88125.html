<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239181157">I asked my question about Pop Warner Cheerleading on my local homeschooling group. One family has experience, but they use a &quot;boxed curriculum&quot; program that happily sent them a report card when they asked for one for their child so that she could participate. <br/>
 <br/>
Having a certain level of grades is apparently mandatory in Pop Warner, and I&#39;m not sure how in the world to come up with something they&#39;d accept other than maybe Clonlara? Any suggestions?! <br/>

There are several blank report cards on the internet<br/>
you could just print on paper, maybe make up a<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  A letter explaining that you don&#39;t do grades, but that your child <br/>
fulfills all the requirements of his homeschooling and you consider him an honors <br/>
student.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m quite sure they&#39;d accept it!  Where we live most people are *impressed* <br/>
when they hear that somebody is homeschooling.  They just assume the kids must <br/>
be so smart and ahead.  (Of course this can lead to other problems when you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling, but that&#39;s another topic...)<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t lie.<br/>
Maybe ask them what they want in the case of a child without report cards.  <br/>
Will they discriminate against homeschoolers?   Can you just state that you as <br/>
the teacher think she&#39;s up to their high standards?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Thanks. I just finally found an email address of someone to contact, and I asked what their requirements for a homeschooled child would be. <br/>
