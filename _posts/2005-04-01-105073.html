<div id="ygrps-yiv-286774482">Looking for some details, found some other details. <br/>
That&#39;s how details always seem to go with me.<br/>
From &quot;the Kirby diary&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
January 25, 1991 I was recording Romeo and Juliet onto videotape and Kirby <br/>
was watching the end.  I was in the other room and he came in and said “That <br/>
lady has got that man’s sword in her herself!”  A couple of hours later he came <br/>
and asked me about it, and I told him as simply as I could the story, and I <br/>
expected any minute he’d lose interest and that it would be enough, but he asked <br/>
more questions.  I explained some of it by saying that when he’s 16 and old <br/>
enough to drive a car (that’s the big marker in his mind—16) that he might <br/>
love a girl so much his stomach hurt, and that Romeo and Juliet loved each other <br/>
so much their stomachs hurt all the time.  He went with that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tue, Apr 30, 1991  <br/>
Marty likes to take the five Lego horses, put them in a big basket, and say <br/>
they’re his babies.  Kirby didn’t want him to do it today.  I made Kirby leave <br/>
him alone, and so Marty put the horses in the basket and I gave him a flannel <br/>
baby blanket, and he was very happy.  After a while, in the other room, I <br/>
hear Kirby saying “You know what these are?  They’re not babies.  They’re just <br/>
toys.”  and I hear “tap tap tap”  like Kirby’s tapping on the plastic horse <br/>
to emphasize that they’re not babies.  I called Kirby in where I was and said <br/>
“don’t do that to Marty, that’s mean,” and Kirby said really pretty <br/>
innocently that Splinter was saying that, that Kirby wasn’t saying it, that he was just <br/>
making Splinter say it.  I told Kirby it would be mean of me to say “This <br/>
isn’t really Splinter, it’s just a toy,” and I tapped on his head with my <br/>
fingernail.  He looked thoughtful, and said, “Well I can play with Splinter however <br/>
I want to.”  “Okay, but you can’t play with Marty however you want to.  <br/>
How’s that?”    “Not very good.” he said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was nearly five,<br/>
Marty was a year and a half old.</div>
