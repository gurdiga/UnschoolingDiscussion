<div id="ygrps-yiv-753486154">&quot;Our experience with 4H has been awful.  The signups are basically a starting <br/>
line with &#39;ready set go&#39;, and the kids run to what they want to sign up for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here scratching my head and saying &quot;huh?&quot;<br/>
I have no idea what exactly you tried to sign up for, or if 4-H has some bizarre activity day where you live, but that isn&#39;t how you sign up for 4-H.<br/>
You sign up by contacting your County Extension office and asking for the 4-H coordinatoor, and she/he will give you forms so you can sign up as a family, or hook up with an existing club.<br/>
We just formed our own club...you can do that too and they will guide you through the process. We&#39;re &quot;The Autodidacts&quot; :) of course. Or more formerly &quot;The Autodidacts Science Club&quot;.<br/>
As a group, you focus on a group project for the year (or more than one) plus hang out and do fun things together. As a science club, we will focus on environmentalism and nature, but there are horse clubs, agriculture clubs, computer clubs, guide dog clubs, community service clubs etc... <br/>
Even though our club is a science focused club, as individuals, my children will pursue whatever they are interested in (that&#39;s why 4-H is so unschool friendly for a club) and fill out a project book based on what they want to do. Trevor is focusing on computers, since it&#39;s something he would be doing anyway! <br/>
In the past, we&#39;ve incubated eggs, hatched butterflies, made &quot;encouragement houses&quot; for children living with AIDS, etc...<br/>
The 4-H office provides us with project books to record their activities and curriculum based on their interests (from marine biology to horsemanship and beyond) and other avenues for the kids to explore topics. Teen Court is held here, and the teens actually act as lawyer, judge and jury..deciding the fate of a teen peer that has been incarcerated. It&#39;s the real thing, pretty cool experience for a teen thinking about a legal field. There&#39;s county events in which they can create a talk about any topic or be part of the talent show, fair time provides more opportunities to exhibit their work...<br/>
The other reason we formed a club, rather than just pursuing these same things on our own, is the grants you can get. There are some amazing places open to us as a club, that wouldn&#39;t be otherwise.<br/>
One of them is a Marine lab on Dauphin Island where we can participate and actually have a camp for the club...the general public wouldn&#39;t be allowed in.<br/>
Anyway, 4-H is a very broad club, with many opportunities, I just can&#39;t figure out how anything would be &quot;taken&quot; by a sign up day.<br/>
Maybe you could clarify.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453590813">Ha.  THats not how they do it here.<br/>
<br/>
You call the county extension office and they tell you when the &quot;meeting&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
You go to the meeting, and then all the &quot;clubs&quot; each have their own table with sign up sheets.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the meeting you race to whatever club you want and hope you get there in time.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the club you want, THEN you do the project, etc.  But you can&#39;t pick a club without attending the &quot;meeting&quot; and racing to the table for the first come first serve sign up.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 4 May 2004, at  9:28pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639432172">I&#39;ll tell you what else I had happen.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was 6, he did a 4H thing through an after school program.  He decided to put together a model car.<br/>
<br/>
At his age, &quot;snap together&quot; cars were permissible for the club, so that is what he did, and then he painted it.  His manual dexterity was not very good at the time (in fact he is dysgraphic and has a great deal of trouble with handwriting, even at age 15).<br/>
<br/>
When the judging was done, we got the paper, and the judge was absolutely AWFUL.  I was in tears.  He made all kinds of nasty remarks about how it wasn&#39;t a &quot;real&quot; model, and it wasn&#39;t even well painted, etc.  I think he even refused to give it a participating ribbon.  His remarks were FULL of contempt and disgust.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe anyone could be such an asshole.  I contacted the office and let them have it.  He did get a participation ribbon I think but I have never forgotten that.<br/>
<br/>
When we finally decided to try 4H again a few years ago, the sign ups were awful. We&#39;ve tried twice but its always like that.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll call the office tomorrow and tell them what I think of it.  I didn&#39;t say anything before because I just assumed they were all like that and I was &quot;missing something&quot;.  Apparently the only thing I&#39;m &quot;missing&quot; is a GOOD 4H program.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll contact one somewhere else instead (since we want to make friends).<br/>
<br/>
Ren, yours sounds so great.  I wish it was like that here.<br/>

sort of emphasis, true, but they offer whatever projects that they have <br/>
leaders willing to run. So my daughter&#39;s club is mostly horse project <br/>
kids - but they also have leathercraft, dehydrated foods, arts and <br/>
crafts, veal calves, leadership, rabbits, pigs, sewing, theater, <br/>
photography, and maybe some others I&#39;ve forgotten. My daughter does <br/>
photography, leadership, theater, and horse. She&#39;d like to do more, but <br/>
this is mostly school kids so meetings are in the evenings and there <br/>
are only so many evenings in the week. Community service isn&#39;t a <br/>
project, it is an all-club activity. Nearby clubs have other projects <br/>
like quilting and flower arranging and cake decorating and more. Kids <br/>
in one club can sign up for projects in other clubs, too, if there is <br/>
room for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003638655">I&#39;ve never heard of a bad 4-H group here in WI.<br/>
They are one of the best things going, as they more closely emulate real <br/>
life, unlike school.  Parents to the young children, and all working <br/>
together.<br/>
Try a different club, or start a new one and get a good Constitution and <br/>
you&#39;ll attract kids & parents who like a decent club.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120842301">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t 4-H awesome?<br/>
<br/>
I think the difference in your experience and the original poster&#39;s is the<br/>
difference between a project club (organized around science, horses, etc.)<br/>
and a community club (organized around a location with many interests and<br/>
projects involved in that one club).<br/>
<br/>
In our area, we have both kinds of clubs.  In the community clubs, someone,<br/>
usually a parent or older teen, volunteers to lead a project and others sign<br/>
up to participate.  Our club had over 15 projects going this year, ranging<br/>
from dairy goats to ballistics.<br/>

&gt; You call the county extension office and they tell you when the &quot;meeting&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>

many as you can handle.  Younger kids (10 and below) are limited in <br/>
choices.<br/>
Within each project the time commitment varies, as one can sew a simple <br/>
garment or a complex dress.  Simple electricity project or complex, <br/>
dependent on age and interest.  Showing animals often take training <br/>
them several times weekly, if not daily, thus horses, cows, or dogs can <br/>
take the most time commitment.<br/>

We are signing up for a community club in another county called the &quot;Friendship Club&quot;.  Daughin County has &quot;open enrollment&quot; where Lancaster County does not.<br/>

I contacted the state, but they said I should contact the county.  UGH.<br/>

  How very odd.  I think I would talk to my extention office and if that<br/>

  &gt; Ha.  THats not how they do it here.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; You call the county extension office and they tell you when the &quot;meeting&quot;<br/>
  is.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; You go to the meeting, and then all the &quot;clubs&quot; each have their own table<br/>
  with sign up sheets.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; At the end of the meeting you race to whatever club you want and hope you<br/>
  get there in time.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; If you get the club you want, THEN you do the project, etc.  But you can&#39;t<br/>
  pick a club without attending the &quot;meeting&quot; and racing to the table for the<br/>
  first come first serve sign up.<br/>

  &gt;   Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] 4-H question<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &quot;Our experience with 4H has been awful.  The signups are basically a<br/>
  starting<br/>
  &gt;   line with &#39;ready set go&#39;, and the kids run to what they want to sign up<br/>
  for.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   I&#39;m sitting here scratching my head and saying &quot;huh?&quot;<br/>
  &gt;   I have no idea what exactly you tried to sign up for, or if 4-H has some<br/>
  bizarre activity day where you live, but that isn&#39;t how you sign up for 4-H.<br/>
  &gt;   You sign up by contacting your County Extension office and asking for<br/>
  the 4-H coordinatoor, and she/he will give you forms so you can sign up as a<br/>
  family, or hook up with an existing club.<br/>
  &gt;   We just formed our own club...you can do that too and they will guide<br/>
  you through the process. We&#39;re &quot;The Autodidacts&quot; :) of course. Or more<br/>
  formerly &quot;The Autodidacts Science Club&quot;.<br/>
  &gt;   As a group, you focus on a group project for the year (or more than one)<br/>
  plus hang out and do fun things together. As a science club, we will focus<br/>
  on environmentalism and nature, but there are horse clubs, agriculture<br/>
  clubs, computer clubs, guide dog clubs, community service clubs etc...<br/>
  &gt;   Even though our club is a science focused club, as individuals, my<br/>
  children will pursue whatever they are interested in (that&#39;s why 4-H is so<br/>
  unschool friendly for a club) and fill out a project book based on what they<br/>
  want to do. Trevor is focusing on computers, since it&#39;s something he would<br/>
  be doing anyway!<br/>
  &gt;   In the past, we&#39;ve incubated eggs, hatched butterflies, made<br/>
  &quot;encouragement houses&quot; for children living with AIDS, etc...<br/>
  &gt;   The 4-H office provides us with project books to record their activities<br/>
  and curriculum based on their interests (from marine biology to horsemanship<br/>
  and beyond) and other avenues for the kids to explore topics. Teen Court is<br/>
  held here, and the teens actually act as lawyer, judge and jury..deciding<br/>
  the fate of a teen peer that has been incarcerated. It&#39;s the real thing,<br/>
  pretty cool experience for a teen thinking about a legal field. There&#39;s<br/>
  county events in which they can create a talk about any topic or be part of<br/>
  the talent show, fair time provides more opportunities to exhibit their<br/>
  work...<br/>
  &gt;   The other reason we formed a club, rather than just pursuing these same<br/>
  things on our own, is the grants you can get. There are some amazing places<br/>
  open to us as a club, that wouldn&#39;t be otherwise.<br/>
  &gt;   One of them is a Marine lab on Dauphin Island where we can participate<br/>
  and actually have a camp for the club...the general public wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
  allowed in.<br/>
  &gt;   Anyway, 4-H is a very broad club, with many opportunities, I just can&#39;t<br/>
  figure out how anything would be &quot;taken&quot; by a sign up day.<br/>
  &gt;   Maybe you could clarify.<br/>
  &gt;   ??<br/>

to worry about over-crowding, (or evening meetings), but we&#39;re in Ohio, and <br/>

What Julie said.<br/>
I failed to mention that you officially join an existing club, but you are NOT required to attend meetings and you can most certainly do any project you want! You have a lame agent up there. You join as a family under a club, but you can then do your own thing.<br/>
I just pulled my 4-H folder out, there is a project book called &quot;Do your own thing&quot;. Hmm...sounds like you can do whatever you want to me!! <br/>
There are SO many categories in 4-H that I imagine MOST of their interests will fall under something, if not, you just use the &quot;do your own thing&quot; one.<br/>
I have some really cool booklets on bread baking, marine science, International foods, etc... There is a technology/electronic category that small engine repair and computers fall under, there&#39;s TONS! So I don&#39;t know what the heck this person is talking about.<br/>
Yeah, the club chooses a club project, but each family chooses their own individual project(s).<br/>
Are you close to another county? Maybe you could look into a different county for joining a club. The whole reason they make it possible to join a club and not be at meetings and such, is for rural kids. <br/>
Are you talking to the actual extension agency?<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 6 May 2004, at  1:33am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757577895">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I talked to the actual extension agency.  I think part of the problem is that we might be misunderstanding each other (me and the coordinator).<br/>
<br/>
And yet, she is the same coordinator who has been there since I first tried to get involved.  I can&#39;t imagine why she can&#39;t explain 4H well enough for me to understand.  I don&#39;t have this much trouble understanding anything else LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I also think that she is running things differently than other areas.  For example, she allows the leaders to set space limits on project groups.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first asked about 4H, nobody ever mentioned to me that there was a difference between community clubs and project clubs, something I consider rather important (duh).  They just asked me if I wanted a community club.  I had no idea there were different kinds or what the differences were.<br/>
<br/>
She made it sound like a family can&#39;t just do their own project, then made it sound like I was talking about doing something outside of 4H, and she never even mentioned what our options were once we were part of a club.  This leads me to believe that they don&#39;t encourage that option because she would have mentioned it since I specifically asked about doing our own project.  (She wouldn&#39;t have assumed that I meant &quot;outside of 4H&quot;.)<br/>
 <br/>
The only options she gave me were to join the existing projects within the club, or start my own *club*.<br/>
<br/>
I specifically pointed out to her that the National website says you can enroll any time of year.  But she apparently decided that they would do a limited enrollment, and then only once a year!  There is time from the March meeting until May 1st to enroll, but like I said, many of the projects have limited space, so if you don&#39;t get what you want at the meeting, your poop out of luck.<br/>
<br/>
It really irked me that when I called I asked if we could still enroll and she said &quot;no, enrollment was closed May 1st&quot; and told me we would have to wait until NEXT MARCH! (Especially because its only May 5!).<br/>
<br/>
The state office wasn&#39;t much help either, but I think I am going to contact them again.  I want to get it from them how its &quot;supposed&quot; to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to look up the information on the web, but I can&#39;t find the information all in one place online.  She is sending me written info though.  We&#39;ll see what that says.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I&#39;m rather disgusted, and I&#39;m REALLY glad I asked about it here.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m rambling.  I just can&#39;t get over how ridiculous it all seems!  But I&#39;ll grant, I could be missing something here.  Maybe I&#39;m just not understanding!<br/>

For instance, a calf must be of a certain age and must be weighed at <br/>
certain dates.<br/>
Most county fairs have deadlines or a minimum number of meetings that <br/>
must be attended.<br/>
You can also enter a limited number of projects &quot;open class&quot; in the <br/>
fair, but for inexperience children, they are competing against older <br/>
adults, for instance in photography.  Now we all know a child can <br/>
really develop an interest in photography and excel in it, but for a <br/>
beginner, it can be discouraging to enter the fair open class.<br/>

must be done.<br/>
<br/>
But the autonomy comes in from not HAVING to do agriculture.  You can do<br/>
martial arts or quilting or ballistics or public speaking or citizenship or<br/>
whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
And the fact that your project doesn&#39;t have to look like everyone else&#39;s.<br/>
Two people might be doing quilting but one might make several kinds of<br/>
quilts and another might design blocks, visit an old fashioned quilting bee,<br/>
research different types of batting, etc..<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  And it seems that because our county is heavily agricultural, the entire program is run based on all these rules and deadlines, even for projects that AREN&#39;T agricultural in nature.<br/>
<br/>
I called the office again today and then I emailed the state coordinator.  I&#39;ll send a copy of what I wrote. <br/>
<br/>
The conversation I had with the county agent today was even more disheartening than yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, the woman who runs the neighboring county group is really excited to have us join them, and her email made it obvious she LOVES working with her club.<br/>

I know exactly what you mean.  Adriane was able to turn her interest into<br/>
money though which she really liked.  She just sold a couple of goats for<br/>
$100 a piece and her bunnies earned her $900 at auction.  (I know, bunnies,<br/>
go figure).  Anyway, she is seriously saving her money toward a pickup.<br/>
