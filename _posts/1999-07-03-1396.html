<div id="ygrps-yiv-385012896">I have an unschooling problem I&#39;d like some input on. First, a little intro:<br/>
we&#39;ve been homeschooling for 4 years; 3 kids, ages 10, 6, and 2. The first<br/>
book I read about homeschooling was John Holt&#39;s Teach Your Own, followed by<br/>
the Colfaxes&#39; Homeschooling for Excellence. I have since read most of the<br/>
standard recommended books for folks interested in unschooling, and agree<br/>
with most of what unschoolers say about how people learn.<br/>
<br/>
We never used a curriculum, per se, though I dabbled in unit studies. During<br/>
one of those dabbling times, I was reading to my daughter about the layers<br/>
of the earth, and I could see her eyes glaze over. I put the book down and<br/>
vowed right then never to waste her time or my time trying to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
something she wasn&#39;t interested in. Mostly I&#39;ve kept to that vow, though I<br/>
have on occasion begged her to do some written math.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in unschooling; I see no point in trying to force-feed an<br/>
education. So, what&#39;s my problem? Here it is: I confess to a love for<br/>
curriculum. I would love to order a literature based curriculum for us all<br/>
to do. I love the idea of all those books showing up on the doorstep,<br/>
complete with a schedule for when to read what. I love to seek out books on<br/>
my own as well, and plan &quot;units&quot; on periods of history, collecting resources<br/>
from a variety of catalogs. The kids enjoy these immersions in times--the<br/>
books I choose are good, and I quickly drop the duds. I am alert to fading<br/>
interest and don&#39;t push. But I harbor a secret envy of folks who order these<br/>
terrific curricula (not textbook curricula! it&#39;s Sonlight I lust after..)<br/>
and carry out the plans in their teacher&#39;s manuals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking in recent weeks about why this is,  and how to get it all<br/>
out of my system without screwing up our home learning. I know folks (my dh<br/>
is one) who say, So get a curriculum for yourself and do it! But I know<br/>
that&#39;s not the ticket for me. I think it has to do with harking back to my<br/>
childhood, where September brought the smell of new books and book covers,<br/>
crisp notebooks, and, later on, syllabi promising a semester of learning<br/>
bliss. I loved school, and I want to do it all over with my kids. I can see<br/>
the damage school did to me (I was the A student who desperately feared to<br/>
fail, who learned for the test and then forgot, who excelled in pleasing<br/>
diverse teachers to the detriment of my actual education). But still, I<br/>
loved school.<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only unschooler who secretly drools over the Sonlight catalog? And<br/>
how can I loose myself from this bizarre addiction to learning plans?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are not alone. I have never seen a Sonlight catalog, but I have plenty of<br/>
other education catalogs, and I was just like you in school. I have often said<br/>
that if I could get paid to go to college some more instead of having to pay for<br/>
it, school would be my life&#39;s work. I would have a dozen or more degrees in<br/>
everything.  To make matters worse for me, my degree is in Education, and I was<br/>
taught to teach a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a huge venture for me, and I&#39;m like you, wondering how to turn<br/>
off the natural instinct to do it the way I did it. In my case, my kids have<br/>
never loved school the way I did, so that is a huge motivator. And I have done<br/>
enough reading on unschooling to know it makes tremendous sense, especially with<br/>
kids like mine who are very into the experience of the learning, not the task.<br/>
All I can say is, do what I do. Sit down and write out wonderful, detailed<br/>
lesson plans for every day of the year, and then abandon them after the first<br/>
week when your kids can&#39;t stand it and you can see that! (Yes, last year I went<br/>
out and bought a teacher&#39;s lesson plan book, and had my sons&#39; lessons planned<br/>
out for like 6 months in the future. The first time we went to the muesum<br/>
instead, the whole thing fell apart!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and get yourself some workbooks to play in!<br/>

&gt;Date: Sun, Jul 4, 1999, 12:37 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Am I the only unschooler who secretly drools over the Sonlight catalog? And<br/>
&gt;how can I loose myself from this bizarre addiction to learning plans?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll introduce myself in the next post &lt;g&gt;, but yes, I have some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be two separate issues here: 1) Whether to lust over catalogs<br/>
full of books (by all means, lust! &lt;g&gt;) and buy them and 2) Whether to<br/>
bludgeon your children over the head with them in force-fed learning once<br/>
they arrive &lt;g&gt; (you already know the answer to that one).<br/>
<br/>
You can do this unschoolishly, but there&#39;s (in my opinion) a fine line to be<br/>
walked. You can put a line item in your family budget and sit down<br/>
cheerfully each August and order &quot;books and stuff&quot; with the kids, but if you<br/>
limit it to curriculum-style books, it&#39;s telling the kids something about<br/>
what books you think are &quot;more valuable&quot;, so I&#39;d haul out all the book<br/>
catalogs and pour over them together. Pick out what looks great (I&#39;d<br/>
actually suggest doing this more often than each September, quarterly or<br/>
even monthly, the amount of money of course decreasing if you do it more<br/>
often, unless you are a lotter winner &lt;g&gt;), buy it. Pay no attention to<br/>
whether it is curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
When it arrives, it becomes just so much unschooling fodder, to be used or<br/>
not, to be used &quot;properly&quot; (i.e, according to the underactive imagination of<br/>
the curriculum designer) or NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I have fantasies about being a steeplechase jockey. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m 33 years old,<br/>
200 lbs, 5&#39;9&quot; tall and don&#39;t have the money or land to keep a horse. The<br/>
fantasy doesn&#39;t hurt anybody, but my bankrupting the household and being<br/>
tossed from my steeplechaser at the first fence would hurt everybody,<br/>
including me.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t tell you to &quot;get over it&quot;. I mourn my never-to-have-been<br/>
steeplechasing career. I read Dick Francis books and plan to attend some<br/>
steeplechases as an observer. So I will say, find a way to get some part of<br/>
what you want while abiding by what I&#39;m thinking should really be the<br/>
unschooler&#39;s creed: &quot;first do no harm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, Laura -<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you are completely  strange.  There is something seductive <br/>
about a literature-based curriculum.  I, myself, have tried to collect all of <br/>
the story books that go with the Five in a Row curriculum for young kids, <br/>
even though I would never make my son do any of the lessons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also tempted by all of the packages of fun books about ancient <br/>
civilizations that one can order from FUNbooks.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are wise to consider that what you may need is a curriculum for <br/>
yourself, not for your kids.  Would you really like that?  A package that <br/>
sent you all the Pulitzer prize winning books, fiction and non-fiction, every <br/>
year, with additional background study guides, and a time limit for reading <br/>
them all?  I wouldn&#39;t like that, but I&#39;m strongly non-linear and hate to have <br/>
someone else make up my mind for me.  My kid is the same way.  Your kid <br/>
mileage may vary.<br/>

trying to get at the bottom of why this is, when I know perfectly well it<br/>
would be way less than ideal for my kids (and I&#39;m not following through on<br/>
this desire of mine). I like the planning out of lessons: OK, two weeks to<br/>
read Witch of Blackbird Pond, two weeks to read Tituba, a day or two reading<br/>
from A History of US on the Salem Witch Trials, then a visit to Salem for<br/>
the weekend... That sort of thing. If I want to learn about something, I<br/>
don&#39;t plan it out like that--why do that kind of planning for my kids? I&#39;m<br/>
not attracted to workbooks, assignments, that sort of thing--it&#39;s really the<br/>
plans, the outlines, being thorough and delving deep into the topic at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I do buy a lot of books; I read most of them, and the kids enjoy many of<br/>
them. They come in handy when questions come up, and we read a lot of<br/>
fiction aloud and all enjoy it. I don&#39;t feel like buying books is such a bad<br/>
habit (dh and the groaning bookshelves may disagree here &lt;g&gt;), it&#39;s the<br/>
wanting to make and follow a master plan for reading them all that I would<br/>
like to be free of.<br/>

<br/>
I think I understand the appeal of delving deep.  What we learned in school <br/>
was so shallow, and devoid of context, that it was nearly pointless.  There&#39;s <br/>
a quote that says &gt;&gt;American education is a mile wide and an inch deep.&lt;&lt;  I <br/>
definitely think that we understand and retain material better when we study <br/>
it deeply.  But, it just isn&#39;t possible to have enough time for a course of <br/>
study that is a mile wide and ten feet deep.  We can have depth in many <br/>
places, but I don&#39;t think its humanly possible to have depth everywhere.  <br/>
Human knowledge at this time is just amazingly vast.  So the crucial question <br/>
becomes, what areas are going to be your kids areas of deep learning?  Who <br/>
gets to decide where those are?<br/>
<br/>
One the other hand.... (yep, I am typing w. both hands this morning), I love <br/>
historical fiction as an approach to learning history.  And _Witch of <br/>
Blackbird Pond_ is one of my favorites.  Even though I live in Ca. and my son <br/>
isn&#39;t yet interested in early American History, I have been dreaming about <br/>
the tour of New England that I want to take someday.<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  (Don&#39;t forget Arthur Miller&#39;s play, _The Crucible_, about the witch <br/>
trials.  It was recently turned into a movie.)</div>

Ok, so you like to have a plan for learning but you don&#39;t force your kids to<br/>
be apart of it and you wonder why you like having the plan, is that it? You<br/>
may just be that kind of person. I do the same type of thing, I have ten<br/>
million to-do lists of varying types and schedules and planners. I never<br/>
keep to any of them. :) I just like having it written out. It also is part<br/>
of my learning/absorption style, what I see or hear has to come through my<br/>
hand before I &quot;get&quot; it. Why I&#39;m like this, who knows, it could be from being<br/>
raised in a chaotic family and this is my way of finding structure. I&#39;m also<br/>
deschooling myself which I&#39;m finding out to be quite a process. It&#39;s not<br/>
easy to undo 12 years of brainwashing. :) An idea that struck me when<br/>
reading another post on this thread was the fascination of new in our<br/>
society. New things are better than old things, chop down trees to build a<br/>
new house instead of buying an existing home, new clothes instead of going<br/>
thrift store shopping, you get the picture.  Is a fixation on new things or<br/>
even new to you part of the desire for curriculum? After reading &quot;Your Money<br/>
or Your Life&quot; I decided I don&#39;t need anything else, yes, I have wants but<br/>
realizing the time-life energy connection to things helped me to better make<br/>
decisions regarding purchases.<br/>

I had dreams when I was young of being a dancer or musician, I would have<br/>
loved just to learn an instrument or some jazz steps. :) It didn&#39;t happen<br/>
and I too mourned not being able to realize these dreams. I&#39;d watch a ballet<br/>
on TV or a music video on MTV and I would get this feeling so powerful ever<br/>
since I was young, it was complete joy, I felt lifted. At times it felt<br/>
depressing until I saw that I could be at peace knowing that I can have a<br/>
special appreciation for dance and music. My gift is in being able to<br/>
appreciate and enjoy down deep in my soul the beauty of these arts. And yes,<br/>
I also see that it is never too late and I&#39;m currently taking a line dancing<br/>
class and learning the recorder with my youngest son, but the change from<br/>
feeling like a failure in some way because I was not a dancer or musician to<br/>
seeing a gift in me was wonderful.<br/>

Hi Laura, if it&#39;s really the plans, the outlines, etc that are appealing to<br/>
you, try to do them after the fact.  You could use your talents & skills at<br/>
recording what has been done each day, maybe catagorizing each thing done<br/>
into a school-like box. Then one day when the kids are older you can pull<br/>
them out to show them what they did....or one day they will come in handy<br/>
for college transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought how you might channel your needs more creatively, don&#39;t<br/>
stiffle them...this could be your unschooling project!<br/>
