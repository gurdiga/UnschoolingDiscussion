<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744030627">A friend and I were IMing and she wrote <br/>
 (Why do I so frequently say &quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot; when I mean &quot;no&quot;?)<br/>
<br/>
For fun, I wrote: <br/>
I don&#39;t think I know.<br/>
<br/>
and I saw it as a good example of how punctuation can change meaning, and in <br/>
this case the proper punctuation would be a semi-colon:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think; I know.<br/>
<br/>
Quite different meanings:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I know.<br/>
I don&#39;t think; I know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the reason it would take a semi-colon is each half could stand alone as a <br/>
sentence, but they&#39;re being used as parts of a whole thought.<br/>
<br/>
If the question of when to use semi-colons comes up I hope I remember this, <br/>
and you&#39;re all welcome to use it widely and freely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893241797">A fun book that clearly discusses the use of semi-colons and other <br/>
nit-picky punctuation is Eats, Shoots and Leaves.  It&#39;s one of those <br/>
books that explains something you&#39;ve heard a million times but never <br/>
really understood in such a way that it gives you an &quot;aha&quot; moment and <br/>
it&#39;s all clear.<br/>
