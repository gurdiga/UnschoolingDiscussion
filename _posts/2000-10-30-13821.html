The Parent&#39;s Essential Active Role in Unschooling<br/>
John O. Andersen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe in unschooling; the &quot;curriculum&quot; of freely following<br/>
one&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, when it comes to unschooling children, parental  involvement is a must.<br/>
This is because children often won&#39;t know they have an interest in something<br/>
until after their parents give them a glimpse of the many fascinating ideas<br/>
and pursuits the world offers.<br/>
<br/>
Wise unschooling parents expose their children to the community, to complex<br/>
issues, to a broad spectrum of people, to the greatest minds, and so forth.<br/>
There is a variety of ways they might do this.  Here are few concrete<br/>
examples:<br/>
<br/>
Take your children to an art museum.  Interpret a painting for them.  Then<br/>
ask for their interpretations of that one or another painting.  Go home and<br/>
create your own oil paintings.  Attend public meetings.  Arrange for your<br/>
children to meet the mayor, or a senator, or congressman.  Take your<br/>
children to a street demonstration.  Discuss why people demonstrate.   Take<br/>
them to the zoo.  Sit on a bench for awhile and watch a particular animal.<br/>
Talk about what you see.  Let your children tell you what they see.<br/>
Volunteer at a library, or other community organization.  Show your children<br/>
how rewarding it can be to give service to others.  Take walks together<br/>
through nature preserves.  Intentionally slow down and truly notice the<br/>
plants, and wildlife.  Both of you record your impressions in your journals<br/>
when you get home.  Seek out interesting and creative people in your<br/>
community such as inventors, authors, scientists, and poets.  Arrange to<br/>
visit with these people in their homes, attend their lectures, write letters<br/>
to them, or perhaps persuade them to be your child&#39;s mentor.  Read books<br/>
together everyday.  Talk about ideas and philosophies while eating dinner.<br/>
Be a passionate scholar yourself.  Visit historical sites.  View films<br/>
together about historic events.  Write letters to grandparents and other<br/>
people who are much older.  Help your children establish strong connections<br/>
with the past.  Take your children camping.  Go on guided tours whenever you<br/>
can.  Write about what you learn.  Arrange for penpals for your children;<br/>
perhaps same-aged children from other countries and cultures.  Travel often<br/>
locally and, if possible, internationally.  When appropriate, make a point<br/>
to talk with people on the street and in the shops.  Ask them questions and<br/>
listen carefully.  Be endlessly curious.  Taste the joy of having many<br/>
diverse interests.  Be actors in a local play.  Join a gymnastics club.<br/>
Take fencing lessons as a family.  Learn to play a musical instrument.<br/>
<br/>
The list goes on and on and on.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean doing all of that<br/>
at once.  Rather, it has to do with being active learners, with creating<br/>
your own intellectual stimulation, with sincerely believing you can actually<br/>
learn something without tests, tuition payments, classroom time, or grades.<br/>
<br/>
And it is anything but passive and directionless.  On the contrary, it is<br/>
arguably one of the most demanding of all learning methods and potentially,<br/>
the most stimulating as well. For it to succeed, parents need to be their<br/>
children&#39;s facilitators, constantly seeking ways to harness the endless<br/>
learning resources of their local community, and ultimately the world around<br/>
them.  It&#39;s not a job for the fainthearted or those who are happier<br/>
following instructions from degreed and certified experts.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, it&#39;s about lighting a fire within yourself and letting it burn<br/>
brightly enough that your children naturally desire to become engulfed as<br/>
well.<br/>

<br/>
This was simply wonderful and so inspirational.  Thank you.  It seemed to be <br/>
just what I needed today.  We&#39;ve just had a really rough week with my 12 yo <br/>
son.  This is his first year homeschooling.  We&#39;ve been having a hard time <br/>
pinpointing his interests.  It is like pulling teeth.  He is bascially not <br/>
interested in anything.  He&#39;d rather sit around doing workbook pages and <br/>
playing his gameboy when he is done. (I&#39;d like to throw the gameboy out of <br/>
the window!!!)  I&#39;ve tried many of your ideas in the past, but it is so nice <br/>
to see someone recommending them in print again.  We do the library, the <br/>
musueams, parks, volunteer time at a local living history farm, surf the net <br/>
together for ideas, read, etc.  Sometimes I feel like I am banging my head <br/>
into a wall of his laziness.  I can&#39;t think of a better word.  Does anyone <br/>
else have any suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Laura, repeat after me:  &quot;I am the parent.  I am the parent.&quot; (ha)<br/>
Seriously, I am new to this list, and not sure of the tone yet.  But I will<br/>
answer your post as an &quot;older and wiser&quot; mother of 24 years and homeschooler<br/>
of 11 years, whose been there, done that, and made all the mistakes.<br/>
When we started to homeschool, I took a 6th grade girl out of a Christian<br/>
school.  The first year was spent teaching her to obey, and teaching her<br/>
diligence, something we had lost during those school years.  First I want to<br/>
suggest, if you don&#39;t have the courage to throw that gameboy out, at least<br/>
restrict his use of it to an hour or two a day, after he has done something<br/>
worthwhile with his time.  Now, you need to give him something<br/>
 to take it&#39;s place.  When we threw out the TV and video games, I found out<br/>
my children had all kinds of interests.   My oldest son (age 15) out to be<br/>
an<br/>
incredible artist.  Our church is going to use his work on their calender<br/>
this year.  My second son (age 13) has learned an interest in knife making.<br/>
Tell him you will buy him something, or take him somewhere to take up the<br/>
gameboy time.  It just has to be worthwhile.  Then don&#39;t allow anything else<br/>
like that in your home.  Please, don&#39;t be afraid to lead him.  You don&#39;t<br/>
have all those years of experience for nothing!!  God gave you to him and<br/>
him to you, for you to teach and train him in the way he should go.  Don&#39;t<br/>
lose these valueable years, because when they are gone, they are gone.  And<br/>
believe me, they pass a lot faster than you think.  My first two are grown<br/>
and have their own families now.<br/>

  I have to quibble a bit with your thoughts here...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is because children often won&#39;t know they have an interest in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>something<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; until after their parents give them a glimpse of the many fascinating<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ideas<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and pursuits the world offers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While this is true, that parents will affect what their children come in<br/>
contact with, it seems as if you&#39;ve bought the line that *only* parents will<br/>
be giving their children glimpses of the world.  That&#39;s just not so. My<br/>
children bring as many wonderful things and people into our lives as I do.<br/>
Age and personality certainly factor in here, but to say they won&#39;t know<br/>
unless parents give them &quot;glimpses&#39; is not the whole truth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wise unschooling parents expose their children to the community, to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>complex<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; issues, to a broad spectrum of people, to the greatest minds, and so<br/>
 </span></blockquote>forth.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is a variety of ways they might do this.  Here are few concrete<br/>
&gt; examples:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, again, this is true.....but it&#39;s a small part of our truth.  For us<br/>
what is even more true (if there can be such a thing) is that my  *reaction*<br/>
to the people, ideas and projects they come up with themselves is what&#39;s<br/>
important.  I once allowed my child to spend the night with a neighbor<br/>
child, where she was exposed to a drunken father/husband.  We spent many a<br/>
hour discussing that complex issue.<br/>
<br/>
Life itself brings all kinds of things right to our door, it&#39;s in not<br/>
turning away that we, as parents, have our opprotunity.<br/>

<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Well, hm.......... I&#39;ve been 
following this thread and although I&#39;ve been lurking only a short while, I&#39;ve 
been&nbsp; homeschooling two daughters a long time. My experience has been quite 
different from some of those mentioned and I feel compelled to expose a 
different perspective.</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">We spent six months de-schooling our 
oldest&nbsp;daughter, Katie who was only in public school for a few short 
months.&nbsp; We did *not* have to teach her to obey or eliminate television or 
Nintendo. The &#39;obeying&#39; part, imo,&nbsp; naturally occurred because she was 
always respected and an intregal part in the decision making process of our 
family. Even at the tender age of 5, she had a voice.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Television or game machines 
(including the computer) were never treated as a &quot;hands off&quot; item. Yes, both 
dd&#39;s have done their share of zoning out at the TV but they THEN decide enough 
is enough and they choose to turn it off and find many other activities to 
do.&nbsp; Yes, we are always exposing them  to new experiences as was mentioned 
in the Anderson post and that has been a big part in broadening their horizons. 
But TV has also been an important part. </font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">The most recent example occurred 
during this past year. Katie, now 14.5, likes to stay up late watching TV&nbsp; 
or studying and she sleeps late in the a.m.&nbsp; She&#39;s on her own body clock 
schedule and after attempts of trying to change it, I decided it was something 
not worth changing.&nbsp; Anyway, on channel 48 (here in the east), Katie 
watched a show called Trauma in the E.R.&nbsp; I caught a glimpse of it once and 
with all the blood and guts, I quickly exited the room for it was *not* my cup 
of tea. Frankly, I was surprised that Katie was even watching it because she had 
*never* before had the stomach to watch even a splinter being removed.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">As months passed,&nbsp;Katie came to 
me and wanted to know what she needed to study to become a doctor. I quickly 
researched all I could get my hands on about becoming a doctor and reported back 
that a well-rounded education was important and it wouldn&#39;t hurt to have some 
science courses covered ahead of time as well as Latin. (there were 
others&nbsp;subjects but I won&#39;t go into that here).&nbsp; She asked that I take 
her to Borders, which I did, and she picked out Anatomy &amp; Physiology (<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/marieb-essentials/index.html">http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/marieb-essentials/index.html</a>&gt;. 
She has been reading/teaching herself anatomy&nbsp;using a  book that a lot of 
curriculum coordinators would&#39;ve declared too hard for her age.&nbsp; Now, this 
wasn&#39;t an inexpensive book and I realized that&nbsp; if we were going down the 
&quot;doctor&quot; road, it would be prudent to make *sure* she enjoyed that field based 
on more than a TV show. Luckily, I have a&nbsp;acquaintance friend who is an 
anesthesiologist and she was willing to allow Katie to shadow her around on her 
daily routine. </font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">The day arrived and Katie was 
supposed to be in front of the O.R at 6:30 (yeah, sure... I&#39;m thinking to 
myself. This, in itself, is a true test!).&nbsp; I was surprised when Katie woke 
up at 4:45 (willingly ..... and *cheerfully*!) and was at the O.R. by 6:15. She 
was met by our friend, dressed in scrubs and with&nbsp;second set in hand 
for&nbsp;Katie to wear.&nbsp; This is it, I&#39;m thinking to myself.&nbsp; If the 
dress code doesn&#39;t get to her, we are making progress. (anyone with a teenage 
daughter will probably understand what I mean by that&lt;g&gt;).</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">I left the hospital making sure the 
cell phone was turned on because I was worried that someone would call and say, 
&quot;Katie fainted when she saw blood. Come get her&quot;.</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Time drug by that morning for me and 
I was eager to pick her up at the appointed noon time.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t know what 
to expect........</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">......and then I saw&nbsp;Katie come 
around the corner&nbsp;of the O.R. and her gait said it all. My eyes moved up to 
her face and&nbsp;Katie was all smiles and there was this glow that I can&#39;t 
begin to describe. We&nbsp; did our &quot;thank you&#39;s&quot; to everyone and then left. 
Before we were out of the hospital, Katie declared,&nbsp; &quot;now THAT&#39;s what I 
want to be... a DOCTOR. Actually, I want to be a neurosurgeon or an Emergency 
Room Doctor.&quot; </font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Katie&#39;s morning had consisted of 
watching (from four feet away) a tumor removal from a woman&#39;s side. After that 
procedure, they went to peek in on some brain surgery&nbsp;where Doctor invited 
Katie to pull up a step stool so she could get a better view. Then, the Doctor 
proceeded to tell her what the layers of body parts were, what that black hole 
in this person&#39;s brain was ( cancerous area removed from a previous surgery, 
which had returned).&nbsp; Katie said he used words the size of a suburban and 
she hadn&#39;t heard of most of them.&nbsp; But, since that time, she&#39;s come across 
them in her anatomy book and remembers them.&nbsp; Her dedication to her chosen 
goal is phenomenal and I can honestly say it comes from within her own soul. As 
her parents, her father and I had little to do with it, other than providing the 
transportation and the money for the books.&nbsp; Had our situation been 
different and I were directing her toward her future goals, I can assure you, I 
would not have chosen such a difficult path and the natural desire to learn 
could&#39;ve been crushed. </font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">So, in closing, I think it&#39;s of the 
utmost importance that we let our children find their own paths and yes, even 
tv, computer games and videos can lead to a successful ending.&nbsp; Trust that 
your children will stop when they&#39;ve had enough (of the &#39;bad&#39; stuff, such as tv) 
and will move on to bigger and better things. </font></div>

  and wiser&quot; mother of 24 years and homeschooler<br>of 11 years, whose been 
  there, done that, and made all the mistakes.<br>When we started to homeschool, 
  I took a 6th grade girl out of a Christian<br>school.&nbsp; The first year was 
  spent teaching her to obey, and teaching her<br>diligence, something we had 
  lost during those school years.&nbsp; First I want to<br>suggest, if you don&#39;t 
  have the courage to throw that gameboy out, at least<br>restrict his use of it 
  to an hour or two a day, after he has done something<br>worthwhile with his 
  time.&nbsp; Now, you need to give him something<br>to take it&#39;s place.&nbsp; 
  When we threw out the TV and video games, I found out<br>my children had all 
  kinds of interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; My oldest son (age 15) out to 
  be<br>an<br>incredible artist.&nbsp; Our church is going to use his work on 
  their calender<br>this year.&nbsp; My second son (age 13) has learned an 
  interest in knife making.<br>Tell him you will buy him something, or take him 
  somewhere to take up the<br>gameboy time.&nbsp; It just has to be 
  worthwhile.&nbsp; Then don&#39;t allow anything else<br>like that in your 
  home.&nbsp; Please, don&#39;t be afraid to lead him.&nbsp; You don&#39;t<br>have all 
  those years of experience for nothing!!&nbsp; God gave you to him and<br>him 
  to you, for you to teach and train him in the way he should go.&nbsp; 
  Don&#39;t<br>lose these valueable years, because when they are gone, they are

<br/>
I think you should FIRST give him something more interesting than the Gameboy <br/>
to do.  Restriction will only increase the value of the Gameboy and could <br/>
erode the joy of being home, and even erode the faith the child has in the <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
Children will &quot;obey&quot; when parents are making sense and being compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this writer:  <br/>
&lt;&lt;So, in closing, I think it&#39;s of the utmost importance that we let our<br/>
children find their own paths and yes, even tv, computer games and videos<br/>
can lead to a successful ending.  Trust that your children will stop when<br/>
they&#39;ve had enough (of the &#39;bad&#39; stuff, such as tv) and will move on to<br/>
bigger and better things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Belitting a child&#39;s interested (in Game Boy or anything else) amounts to <br/>
belittling the child.  Given a rich and stimulating environment, they *will* <br/>
gravitate toward things they&#39;re interested in.  Some families just have the <br/>
kids hanging out at the house day after day while the parents do whatever <br/>
they would do if the kids weren&#39;t even home.  We do that sometimes too, <br/>
certainly, but not EVERY day.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We&#39;ve been having a hard time <br/>
pinpointing his interests.  It is like pulling teeth. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t NEED to pinpoint interests.  Let him be interested in everything, <br/>
even if it&#39;s just very short bursts of interest.  Someday he might fall in <br/>
love with some field of interest, or he might never, but keep the swirl of <br/>
information rich instead of watery and monotonous.<br/>

This sounds a lot like my 10.5yo stepson. He doesn&#39;t homeschool with us. He <br/>
is a public school student and he is accustomed to having his entire day <br/>
planned for him. He is used to people telling him what to learn and how to <br/>
learn it. When he has free time he gravitates to the television and video <br/>
games. While I have seen a lot of good programming, I have seen that he does <br/>
*not* get tired of television and turn it off. He will watch day in and day <br/>
out, all day if no one tells him to turn it off. Sounds like your son still <br/>
has that institutional mentality and needs a chance to deschool some more.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped me discover some of Trenton&#39;s interests was to watch TV <br/>
with him. I found that he almost always watched certain kinds of shows. Wild <br/>
animals, extreme sports, the world&#39;s strangest people - shows about those <br/>
things appealed to him. I&#39;ve tried to get him books about those subjects and <br/>
send him websites that deal with those things. I also take him to lectures <br/>
about local wildlife and on hikes to try to spot some of the creatures he <br/>
sees on tv. I do restrict the tv and videos because he is really not an <br/>
independent enough thinker right now to make that decision for himself. <br/>
Besides, the constant babbling from the set really irritates me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest continuing to be patient and doing what you think is best in <br/>
terms of the electronics. You know your son best. Just don&#39;t expect him to <br/>
change from a school mentality to an unschooling mentality overnight. Isn&#39;t <br/>
the rule of thumb for deschooling something like a month for every year <br/>
they&#39;ve spent in school? (That doesn&#39;t include summer vacation.) Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961631501">&quot;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.  Honor your<br/>
father and mother- which is the first commandment WITH A PROMISE-that it may<br/>
go well with you and that you may ENJOY LONG LIFE ON THE EARTH&quot;.  Ephesians<br/>
6:1-3<br/>
<br/>
I sure want my children to enjoy long life on the earth!!  In my house,<br/>
obeying isn&#39;t an option, based on whether they are interested in what I&#39;m<br/>
telling them or not.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Create in me a pure heart, Oh God.&quot;  Psalm 51:10    &quot;I will set before my<br/>
eyes no vile thing.&quot; Psam 101:3      It isn&#39;t just my job to provide<br/>
interesting things for my children to do and learn from, but also to protect<br/>
them from evil influences.  I would never have allowed my child to spend the<br/>
night in the house with a drunkard.<br/>
<br/>
This list is probably not for me.  It is hard for me to relate in a way that<br/>
isn&#39;t based on scripture, although I am ready to listen to your views for a<br/>
while.<br/>
Does anyone out there see things from a scriptural point of view?  Explain<br/>
it to me.<br/>

    All my eldest daughter (11) is interested in at the moment is reading some 
    awful adolescent sci-fi books and &quot;doing&quot; Japanese animi (sp?) on the 
    computer. I practically had to physically drag her off so I could read my 
    email....this is after 2 hours straight, in her pj&#39;s, still hasn&#39;t had 
    breakfast and it&#39;s nearly lunchtime....This is her existence, and I can&#39;t 
    blame it on public school. She&#39;s never been to 
    school.&nbsp;</span></font></div>

Hi Carla,<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling Christian. I generally don&#39;t discuss my religious beliefs <br/>
on this list, except in the most generic way. There are many people of <br/>
different religious backgrounds on this list and I know religion can be such <br/>
a hot button issue for many.<br/>
<br/>
I am on another list of Christian unschoolers. Perhaps it may be more your <br/>
cup of tea. It&#39;s called UnschoolingJesusFreaks and you can subscribe at <br/>
egroups.com. Things are generally discussed from a biblical point of view. I <br/>
have found lots of value in both lists.<br/>

No joke. I don&#39;t want little clones of me &lt;shudder&gt; but this eldest child of<br/>
mine really puts me to the test, every day.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, if she did as Sarah&#39;s daughter and showed interest in surgery,<br/>
I&#39;d have a real problem with it. Only because I&#39;m the type of wimp who<br/>
faints at the sight of needles, much less seeing the insides of other<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
My little artist is upstairs right now, no doubt coloring or reading while<br/>
her sisters are eating lunch. (This will be her breakfast, if she ever comes<br/>
downstairs....)<br/>

I haven&#39;t noticed that this list was religious one way or the other or <br/>
anti-religious.  Just doesn&#39;t seem to be the focus, to me.  Maybe you&#39;ll pick <br/>
up something worthwhile.  But if it&#39;s a heavily religious discussion list <br/>
you&#39;re looking for, I guess this isn&#39;t it.  Hope we can be helpful tho.<br/>

quite a bit in her books about kids who come out of school needing to take<br/>
sort of a mental vacation (I can&#39;t remember the term she uses). Basically,<br/>
they just need to do nothing for awhile, find their momentum, their own<br/>
interests, &quot;de-school&quot; their own thought processes. At first coming out of a<br/>
school, they might have lost their initiative, their own drive to learn<br/>
something just because they find it fascinating. They need time and space to<br/>
find this. That&#39;s her theory anyways, and it is supported by many examples<br/>
of unschooled teenagers in her books who have left school at various<br/>
different stages. If you haven&#39;t read these books, you will probably find<br/>
them really exciting and inspirational in their own right, especially<br/>
because they are mostly geared towards kids who are teenagers or who (like<br/>
your son) are on the verge of that age range.<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of work with this age group - 12 year olds - as a youth<br/>
group leader and a coach. I&#39;ve had several homeschooled kids among my<br/>
groups, and they just have so much more initiative than their schooled<br/>
peers. I can see how it might take a child awhile out of school before they<br/>
pick up on that ability to create their own life lessons. At first they seem<br/>
to be waiting around for someone to tell them what to do.<br/>

expand our experiences even that much more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947725125">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I have been reading all the posts on active rolls on unschooling. Let me just <br/>
say that I took my daughter out of school last December, we started off with <br/>
school at home. That was a nightmare!! My daughter goes in two directions <br/>
either she catches on real fast and then gets bored  to death or she has a <br/>
hard time and gets really frustrated and starts with the poor me , Im so <br/>
dumb, or Im stupid. The latter part of it really bothers me. So began the <br/>
unschooling journey, I have read and reread all the books I can get my hands <br/>
on (lucky for me I love to read.) Any way it was very hard for me to see the <br/>
big picture and still is , we started officially unschooling in April of last <br/>
year and all seemed well in the beginning ..After reading the books again and <br/>
reading the posts on the list , I felt confident to go with it. I have spent <br/>
the last 6 months watching my daughter sit in front of the t.v. or play <br/>
gameboy(Im with the mother who said she would like to throw gameboy out the <br/>
window)some days she does nothing but eat all day. Let me just say I think at <br/>
this point I have very little tongue left as I have bitten right off trying <br/>
to keep my nagging mouth shut. Everyone says this is the de-schooling stage <br/>
and I should let her be. So I have. I have spent many sleepless nights <br/>
wondering if what I feel in my heart could truely be what is right in my <br/>
head. I love the idea of unschooling but the schoolish part of me needs to <br/>
see results. We are required by law in NH to test once a year. We did that in <br/>
July with the PASS Test from Hewitt Resources. I JUST recieved the results <br/>
Friday. She did really good. 90th% on the nationals  ( with no help from me <br/>
other than organizing the pages) <br/>
I am so sorry to go on but this week has been very difficult for me. Before <br/>
we started unschooling my daughter loved to read , draw, make concoctions in <br/>
the kitchen. (which I hated) Now when she says shes bored and I suggest she <br/>
read one of the million books I have bought for her, she replies with &quot;Mom , <br/>
I dont want to do school work.&quot;  when the &quot;school&quot; year started this sept. I <br/>
thought I would be prepared for ALL the great things that would happen so I <br/>
ordered all kinds of books  like Cartooning for beginners and Easy drawing <br/>
lessons  and How to draw animals. She has not touched them. I bought  The Big <br/>
Book of How. and other reference materials , nothing specific , just stuff <br/>
that she could use if she had a motivation. I DID NOT push them on her , just <br/>
let her know they were there if she wanted them. I have mentioned music <br/>
lessons and theater(shes a Drama Qween)  She takes Riding lessons  and loves <br/>
that but shows no interest in the two horses that we own. She is an only <br/>
child and is lonely sometimes but when I bring up a support group (we even <br/>
went to one) she shrugs it off. When I suggested 4-H  she had no interest. Or <br/>
she replies with &quot;Mom , that is so queer&quot; Truthfully at this point I am at a <br/>
complete loss .Now I am having a problem with family members. I had mentioned <br/>
to my sister that Kearstins test results came in and she did really good on <br/>
them. She said that was great. But while we are on the subject I wanted to <br/>
talk to you about this homeschooling thing. (None of my family members <br/>
supports me on this , except my wonderful husband.) So of course I was a <br/>
little on gaurd. She said that my family had a &quot; Family Discussion&quot; about me <br/>
and that they felt that homeschooling was not in &quot;The Best Interest of <br/>
Kearstin&quot; as there is no  structure and every kid needs stucture!!! I was <br/>
livid at first . My reaction was who the hell are you to discuss my family <br/>
and who do you think you are telling me that I might unknowingly hurt my <br/>
child . My poor sister was elected by the family to have this talk with me <br/>
because she is the most likely to be open and compassionate.??? She said that <br/>
is was discussed that maybe someone should make a phone call to child <br/>
services so that I would comply with my familys wishes and send my daughter <br/>
back to school where she will recieve stucture!!!  You will be happy to know <br/>
that I did not lose control.,...... or my temper I did not even raise my <br/>
voice. I talked it out with my sister I put myself in there shoes and thought <br/>
how I could explain my views and hopes. She felt aweful and asked me if I was <br/>
mad at her. I said no Im not mad. I am hurt and disappointed that nobody <br/>
called me to ask me in the first place . That if they were so concerned they <br/>
would have gone to the bookstore and read up on homeschooling and unschooling <br/>
and tryed to see where I was coming from. That really it was none of their <br/>
business how I bring up my daughter, but because they said they were <br/>
concerned I would try to help them understand.  I asked my sister that if I <br/>
brought her some books , would she read them and try to at least get an idea <br/>
of unschooling. Then at least even if she dosnt agree she will know why she <br/>
dosnt agree. I told her I wouldnt change my mind about unschooling because I <br/>
believe in my heart that its the right thing to do. But that I would keep the <br/>
family updated on her progress. (as soon as I figure that one out.) <br/>
So I left there feeling very unsure of myself and found myself questioning <br/>
yet again if I really knew what I was  doing. I talked with my husband ( who <br/>
just about went through the roof when I told him of the family discussion) <br/>
But he assured me that we were doing fine and we should keep waiting for <br/>
Kearstin to show signs of Motivation. If any kind soul would like to send out <br/>
some advice or reassurences. I would be most grateful as I turn to the lists <br/>

They had a family meeting without inviting you or even mailing you the agenda?<br/>
How Rude!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you did sounds good (if way too much work for you), and here&#39;s an idea <br/>
for Phase II:  If they&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s their place to decide what and how <br/>
and when to call Social Services, you might (bluffing) send them the &quot;bill&quot; <br/>
(brochures and figures) for structure-providing activities such as dance <br/>
schools and theatre groups and all kinds of stuff and tell them to split it <br/>
however they want to, but to send the money as soon as possible.  If they <br/>
seem surprised at your wanting to pay for Kearstin&#39;s tuition, it will be one <br/>
of those BINGO!! moments for them.  It&#39;s not their responsibility, nor their <br/>
right.  If they own her they can pay for her!!!  <br/>

&gt;to my sister that Kearstins test results came in and she did really good on <br/>
&gt;them. She said that was great. But while we are on the subject I wanted to <br/>
&gt;talk to you about this homeschooling thing. (None of my family members <br/>
&gt;supports me on this , except my wonderful husband.) So of course I was a <br/>
&gt;little on gaurd. She said that my family had a &quot; Family Discussion&quot; about me <br/>
&gt;and that they felt that homeschooling was not in &quot;The Best Interest of <br/>
&gt;Kearstin&quot; as there is no  structure and every kid needs stucture!!! I was <br/>
&gt;livid at first . My reaction was who the hell are you to discuss my family <br/>
&gt;and who do you think you are telling me that I might unknowingly hurt my <br/>
&gt;child . My poor sister was elected by the family to have this talk with me <br/>
&gt;because she is the most likely to be open and compassionate.??? She said that <br/>
&gt;is was discussed that maybe someone should make a phone call to child <br/>
&gt;services so that I would comply with my familys wishes and send my daughter <br/>
&gt;back to school where she will recieve stucture!!!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your family must not know just exactly what Child Services is.  I know there are many employees that love and protect children.  But you don&#39;t have to let them into your home and you shouldn&#39;t.  Some of the employees have taken children out the home for dirty laundry.  I know I have seen in court what they have done.  Your family is dangerous.  I would tell them if they did go ahead with call Child Services, they can forget about ever hearing from me or my family again.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with the post the sends your family the &quot;bill&quot; for schooling.  And when they tell you it is not their responsibility, CLEARLY tell them until they see your daughter in danger (so hurt and bruised from your abuse or neglect that it endangers her life) that their opinion should be kept to themselves.  Your style of schooling is safe.  Unlike many of today&#39;s public school where there are guns, knives, drugs, ect...<br/>
<br/>
My step-children go to public high school because they live with their mom.  They tell me that there are drug searches every week, with 10% of the student searched having drugs on them.  The have a weapons search every month and last month 1/2 the cars searched were towed off the property.  When I went to school in the early 80&#39;s, there were 5 rapes in 3 years, 1 teacher was beat and put in the hospital, and we had armed guards on campus.  So public school is really dangerous and uncaring choice in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If Child Service and the courts rule that you must place your children in school, that endangers all of us.  If they can tell us how to school our children, they can tell us how to raise them, what church to bring them too, what kind of medical care, ect...<br/>

<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Thanks, Kathy. I always hesitate to 
tell it, thinking that it may come across as bragging. Yes, I am very proud of 
her and how she&#39;s doing (and I *do* brag%-/ ).&nbsp; What spurs me on to risk 
the bragging&nbsp;label is that I do believe there&#39;s a place for tv. If a parent 
leaves it up to the kids to decide what to watch, as I did, THEN SITS WITH THE 
KIDS TO WATCH IT (very important), the kids seem to govern themselves over 
what&#39;s right and wrong. And, if they choose a &quot;wrong&quot; show to watch, it&#39;s a 
great time to nit-pick the show to death, pointing out all it&#39;s flaws.( &quot; gosh, 
did you all see how&nbsp;that actress was dressed and how that, alone, affected 
how those officials treated her?!&nbsp; Is that&nbsp;right/just? And whether or 
not it is, why&nbsp;would she choose to dress like that? What could she do to 
give a different impression?&quot;..&nbsp; that kind of stuff) After approaching the 
tv monster in this manner, I have had no problems with the girls choosing &#39;bad&#39; 
stuff to watch. They see through it and it&#39;s not something mystical and 
wonderful anymore.</font></div>
