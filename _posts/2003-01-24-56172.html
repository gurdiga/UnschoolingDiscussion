<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me asking.  I feel like they should notice too.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh.  Get over that.  It will only make you unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is probably true.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Not necessarily because it<br/>
&gt; is what I want, but because I don&#39;t want them to be children who grow up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; let their spouse or children do all the picking up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re not married.  They HAVE no children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true too, and hopefully will be for a while, : - ), but don&#39;t you<br/>
still think that things children &quot;learn&quot; as children affect what type of<br/>
adults they will be.  I know I have spent a lot of time trying to get over<br/>
the things that I learned, and it isn&#39;t easy, lol.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; This line of reasoning is like waking children up every morning at 7:00 so<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll be ready when they get to college or get a job.  How do you know<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; won&#39;t go to night school, work graveyard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand your reasoning here, and definitely don&#39;t get my children up<br/>
early to prepare them for adulthood, afterall I don&#39;t want to get up that<br/>
early, lol. Through all of our homeschooling years we have tried at<br/>
different times to make an early schedule, but really the only thing that<br/>
ever works is getting up early when we HAVE to be somewhere.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The best preparation for the future is a happy today.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree with that, so I would like my children to happily help without<br/>
being asked, : - )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I can see the value in  me not complaining/stressing over this, which I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>really don&#39;t (though they may know it bothers me)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The ideal is not to hide the bother, but to overcome it and NOT be<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bothered.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this is true,and I believe right, but . . .  I noticed when you gave<br/>
the story about asking Marty to get something for you and he didn&#39;t respond<br/>
kindly, you wanted to make sure he knew that.  So you talked to him about it<br/>
when he came after the commerical(not your words obviously, I don&#39;t remember<br/>
the exact quote) and then all were happy.  I think I am doing the same thing<br/>
by saying that they know it bothers me.  But, I am still working on not<br/>
letting it bother, because I know that is the right thing to do.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I would prefer kind considerate<br/>
&gt; kids who jump in and help when they see someone needs that help, without<br/>
 </span></blockquote>being asked.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to help you get to.<br/>
&gt; But if you expect it to look like your dream of them doing hours of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>housework a day, it won&#39;t.  Just as really great unschooling does not EVER<br/>
look like &gt; one hour of math problems, one hour of reading a history chapter<br/>
and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; answering the questions, one hour of writing a report...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t expect this.  I really don&#39;t.  I have done lots of reading before I<br/>
came to this list, and I have been living with my children for years.  We<br/>
have not totally unschooled before (I was one of those unschooling except<br/>
for math and writing folks, sorry), but they did learn to read on their own,<br/>
I have never pushed school type readers (though they have read a whole set<br/>
of them someone gave us, just because they enjoyed them, and they did three<br/>
&quot;years&quot; worth of these readers in about a month, and skipped what they<br/>
didn&#39;t like, etc.)  Not trying to brag here, just trying to let you know<br/>
that I do understand unschooling and I know they will never sit down and do<br/>
school like school is done in schools.  Fortunately, I would never be able<br/>
to handle that anyway.  We have used curriculum over the years, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think we have ever used it in the way it was fully intended to be used.  We<br/>
are not using any curriculum now though, and stopped because I realized I<br/>
was moving toward too much structure(kids who would be in high school if<br/>
they went to school jitters) and my children made it very apparent that it<br/>
would not work.<br/>
<br/>
So am I making any sense?<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help,<br/>

Yes, I can see that is a very good strategy.  I am still really just trying<br/>
to come up with a way to do things in my home, not saying that you didn&#39;t do<br/>
it right, but that I noticed that you did respond.  I also do not want to<br/>
hold on to resentment or anything, that is not good for the children or me.<br/>
But, I guess what I saw in your post is a way to let Marty know what you<br/>
were thinking/feeling but not punishing or judging.  The only difference in<br/>
my family is that I am not sure I know how to let them know without the<br/>
perception that I am judging what they did.<br/>
<br/>
I know now from other posts that the reason you are able to do this is<br/>
because of your relationship with Marty, and that is as it should be.  It is<br/>
just different coming to this in the middle of the teen years and I am<br/>
trying to figure out how to do it for us.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that my children and I have a good relationship, but it obviously<br/>
could use some work in these areas.   I am really trying over the last<br/>
couple of days to be more giving and not expecting in returning.  That is<br/>
probably what it will take in the long haul.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
