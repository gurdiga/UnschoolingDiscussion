&lt;&lt; I know several people who hs and work.  many, like me, work around our<br/>
 partner&#39;s schedule.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I , myself, have joined the ranks of the homeschooling/working moms.  I made <br/>
the decision this summer that I just couldn&#39;t contribute nothing to the <br/>
nonprofit I founded a few years ago.  So this summer I joined on again, but <br/>
as the program development coordinator (fancy word for <br/>
grantwriter/fundraiser).  Oddly enough, if all goes well, I will be making a <br/>
lot more money than when I was out there trying to do this fulltime.  And the <br/>
glory is that I work 95% from home.<br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting mix to try to swing hubby&#39;s 40 hour schedule and my 10 - <br/>
20 (soemitmes 30) hour weekly schedule.  I am trying to adjust to a night <br/>
working schedule now.  I begin work around 8:00 PM and tie it up somewhere <br/>
between 12:00 - 1:00 AM depending.  Hubby gets the boys to bed and does the <br/>
final evening stuff.  The boys and I have agreed that they get up on their <br/>
own in the morning so I can sleep till around 8:30 - 9:00.  So far, all three <br/>
of us have surpassed the 9:00 AM wake up time on several days :o)  So I guess <br/>
we are trying to set up some schedule that does allow for some flexibility.  <br/>
If we all sleep till 10:00 AM, I guess it is OK... but we will just have to <br/>
make sure we try to keep up with scheduled events. <br/>
<br/>
This schedule is very contrary to what I had been striving to implement for a <br/>
few years.  I wanted early to bed, ealry to rise for myself.  But when I do <br/>
that, I find that the boys don&#39;t get the attention they need until around <br/>
noon!!!!  I get going in my work and they just wing it for the morning.  <br/>
Guilt tore me away from that schedule so I am trying the evening thing.  So I <br/>
hope this transition to the evneing schedule works out.  I have my guys from <br/>
morning to evening and we can do whatever!  I do enjoy this part of it!  <br/>
Though I sense tension between hubby and I on the horizon.  So, I may just <br/>
have to be really motivated and try to get my work done by 10:00 or 11:00 PM, <br/>
hahaha.  If I stick a Saturday morning in there, that should work out great!  <br/>
UGH!  Always a balancing act!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, thanks for working through my scheduling problems with me!  I guess as <br/>
long as we all work together as a family and keep our communication lines <br/>
open, we , as a family, will make this work for all of us.  Or else I will <br/>
quit my job! hahaha<br/>
