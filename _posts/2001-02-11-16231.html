<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718631256">Kris, we too have always told our kids the straight up truth about the tooth<br/>
fairy, Santa etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;ve caught a lot of criticism for ruining the kid&#39;s childhood, for carrying<br/>
&gt; the honesty thing too far.  I caught even more flack for refusing to tell<br/>
&gt; them to NOT tell other kids.  I felt it was wrong to make them feel like they<br/>
&gt; had a dirty secret because we chose not to participate in the norm.  I DID<br/>
&gt; explain that most children are told that they are real and their parents<br/>
&gt; probably don&#39;t want her to tell them otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve caught flack too, but imagine how distressing it would have been to my<br/>
kids when the tooth fairy sometimes took 2 weeks to drop in at our house, but<br/>
called the same night as the tooth came out to other kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And why does Santa bring bikes and skateboards to some kids, and only a few<br/>
little things to others? I&#39;ve heard kids ask these questions. My kids have always<br/>
chosen to play the games, but eventually they have all reached the point of<br/>
saying &#39;couldn&#39;t you just pay me for the tooth as soon as it comes out, instead<br/>
of having to go through all this?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest came home for Christmas this year, with his newly wedded wife, and she<br/>
was so rapt that on Christmas morning there was a stocking with silly little<br/>
gifts in it for her! But when your kids have always known Santa / Easter Bunny /<br/>
Tooth Fairy don&#39;t exist, there&#39;s no need to stop the fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I *was* totally traumatised when I discovered the truth about Santa. I had<br/>
not had the least suspicion, but woke up and needed to go to the bathroom in the<br/>
middle of the night and caught Mum and Dad in the act! My sister (4 years older<br/>
than me) told me that if I let on that we knew, we&#39;d never get another present.<br/>
My parents must have thought they had the slowest kids in the country because we<br/>
were still firmly declaring our belief when I was about 12 and she was 16!<br/>
