Christian South). The *old* headmistress spoke to the crowd. Cameron said that she <br/>
said the &quot;S&quot; word no less than 7-8 times (he said it could have been much <br/>
more---he was so stunned!). She kept telling the parents that DISCPLINE was so <br/>
important. That they shouldn&#39;t be afraid to spank. That spanking was good. That <br/>
to spank was to show their children that they love them. That the world needs <br/>
more spanking. This went on and on. I was appalled that someone could get away <br/>
with this in public---in a public address! <br/>

His girlfriend (who went to this school last year) said that there were STILL <br/>
school paddlings when she was there last year. I haven&#39;t asked Devon whether <br/>
it&#39;s still going on, but judging by the speach yesterday, it must be!<br/>
<br/>
Just so&#39;s ya&#39; all know!<br/>

Articles/pages like yours, Sandra, are desperately needed. <br/>

I was pretty pleased to hear that the UK is finally implementing the full Rights of the Child Act it signed a few years back and outlawing spanking/smacking/hitting this year, like many european<br/>
countries have done.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to see that here too...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518321532">Speaking of spanking, I was at a LLL conference last weekend, and during <br/>
the lunchtime chat about &quot;alternative learning&quot; one of the women talked <br/>
about her province&#39;s homeschool conference. She said that there was a <br/>
presentation on spanking, a how-to and how-not-to-get-caught. The spanking <br/>
presenter was promoting a book but I didn&#39;t get to ask the title. Does <br/>
anyone have an idea what it might be?<br/>
