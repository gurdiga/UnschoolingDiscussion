<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882610232">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking more along the lines of specific things that happen to show <br/>
that children learn &#39;educational concepts&#39; without being *taught*.  Like the <br/>
balance example with the see-saw.  Personally, I went through very long <br/>
moments of doubt, before I joined this list...thanks everyone!!!  It was <br/>
difficult for me to *see* the lessons my children were actually learning.  I <br/>
know I&#39;ve seen several people on this list ask about documentation, etc., <br/>
and find it hard to explain exactly *what* their kids are learning in more <br/>
specific terms.  It&#39;s hard for a some people, myself included a lot of <br/>
times!, to make the connection and turn see-sawing into a balance lesson, <br/>
without actually *teaching*.<br/>
<br/>
I also hear a lot of skeptics and nervous moms state that they aren&#39;t <br/>
*creative enough* to turn everday situations into learning opportunities.  <br/>
It seems like if there were a place to read how others use those little <br/>
moments to spring off of, it might help them to realize that learning does, <br/>
in fact, happen all the time.  And for those that need documentation (we <br/>
don&#39;t in Texas) it would be a great asset when trying to translate natural, <br/>
daily activity into educationese.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  I&#39;m not exactly sure if this was what you were looking for or <br/>
not for your page.<br/>

<br/>
The only problem I foresee is that some people might lock onto that idea too <br/>
hard, and want to &quot;see a lesson&quot; in everything, and only see school-style <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; as legitimate goals.  <br/>
<br/>
Most people get over that naturally, but others might see it as the target to <br/>
hit and stick to.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that it seems like a great project and isn&#39;t the same <br/>
(unfortunately for my project &lt;g&gt;) as listing typical days.<br/>

<br/>
Remember, it&#39;s great to expand and enhance and enjoy what your kids <br/>
are doing. The way your day took off from the fork balancing thing <br/>
was a perfect example of a day just flowing and letting the learning <br/>
just *be* right there where it is. Turning anything into a &quot;lesson&quot; <br/>
is not the point. It&#39;s seeing the learning without the lesson that <br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t need to turn them into learning opportunities. The learning <br/>
is there from the start. Even if you had never noticed what your kids <br/>
were doing with the forks, they would still have gotten a little <br/>
piece of the balance puzzle to store in the heads for future <br/>
reference. Learning to play with ideas, and opportunities to expand <br/>
on them is maybe closer to what we&#39;re looking to do.<br/>

A Day With Peter Pan<br/>
by Mary Gold<br/>
<br/>
What could be more playful than Peter Pan? This well-loved musical <br/>
theater production was sure to be a big hit with my daughter and her <br/>
friend. Flying pixies, lost boys, pirates, silliness, songs and fun: <br/>
this was going to be a day for delight. We set off in great <br/>
anticipation, leaving thoughts of learning and homeschooling behind. <br/>
We started off with lunch, whisked off to the production, and stayed <br/>
after to meet the actors for some Q&A. We were after entertainment, <br/>
and that is what we got.<br/>
<br/>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the forum. (Another fine <br/>
musical, by the way.) We experienced something else in the bargain. <br/>
It is something that our children understand instinctively, but we <br/>
parents sometimes have a hard time seeing.  It is something that is <br/>
available in any fun day. We experienced a day of natural learning. <br/>
It was just as meaningful and productive as any day we may have <br/>
scheduled as `educational,&#39; even more so in fact because it was all <br/>
so natural.  We heard new music and rich dialogue. We asked questions <br/>
and found our answers. We were learning! In fact, there was so much <br/>
new information flowing into our day that the girls and I were <br/>
bubbling over with inspiration. Our discussions and enthusiasm  <br/>
lasted the long drive home and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Just for fun (and to inform a friend new to homeschooling) I decided <br/>
to come home and jot it all down. I thought it would be inspiring to <br/>
see in print all the learning that takes place in a child&#39;s fertile <br/>
mind. As an exercise in my own unschooling awareness, I tried to put <br/>
all we had experienced into the language of school. It is what we <br/>
homeschoolers like to call educationese. <br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s see, what exactly could a professional educator come up with <br/>
as a syllabus for a day at the theater? Putting on my best <br/>
bureaucratic curriculum-writin&#39; hat, here is some of what I came up <br/>
with.  <br/>
<br/>
English:  <br/>
-Classical Literature: Introduction to James Barrie&#39;s classic novel <br/>
Peter Pan. Discussed origins of story and compared and contrasted <br/>
visual interpretations of the same story. (We talked about the book, <br/>
the Disney version and the show.)<br/>
-Vocabulary: <br/>
-Introduced the phrase `non sequitur.&#39; Practiced pronunciation and <br/>
used examples in definition.      (This actually did come up, totally <br/>
by accidentÂ—almost as if it were a non sequitur. It was a funny <br/>
conversation.)<br/>
-Introduced the words overture, conductor, director, technician, and <br/>
intermission. (These have a more obvious origin.)<br/>
-Poetry: Created rhymes using classic folk songs.<br/>
 <br/>
Music:<br/>
-Choral participation: Sang traditional songs and composed and sang <br/>
original compositions to traditional tunes. (This happened during the <br/>
drive down to the show. You haven&#39;t lived until you&#39;ve heard that new <br/>
classic, &quot;Dashing through the snow, on a pair of broken skis...&quot; a <br/>
few dozen times.)<br/>
-Attended a musical performance with a full orchestral accompaniment. <br/>
Listened to and discussed different instruments in an orchestra. <br/>
 <br/>
Theater:<br/>
-Attended a professional theater performance. (I guess that one is <br/>
kind of a given.)<br/>
-Researched and presented ideas on technical theater applications. <br/>
(We talked beforehand about how we thought they would do the stunts <br/>
and stage the show.)<br/>
-Attended a presentation on staging, vocal prep, acting techniques, <br/>
scene design and overall production. (This was included as part of <br/>
the Q&A with the actors.)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Science:<br/>
-Intro to physics: Learned about momentum, force, and simple <br/>
machines. (We saw a demonstration of pulleys and counterweights and <br/>
learned exactly how much force it really does take to make Peter Pan <br/>
fly. Apparently the stagehand on the other end of the rope must jump <br/>
off a very high ladder to get the actor airborne.)<br/>
-Electronics: Saw demonstration of microphone and sound technology.  <br/>
(Did you know that microphones are now so small and sensitive that <br/>
they can hide them in the actor&#39;s hair?)<br/>
 <br/>
Math:<br/>
-Money skills, simple addition: Counted out change for tip using <br/>
bills, quarters, dimes and nickels.<br/>
-Intro to Economics: Discussed basic service industry economics. (As <br/>
in &quot;why do we leave a tip?&quot;)<br/>
-Simple multiplication: Figured out the lunch cost per child based on <br/>
the $.55 per year of age formula used at the restaurant.<br/>
 <br/>
Social Sciences:<br/>
-Interpersonal Relationships: Explored and experimented with various <br/>
interpersonal scenarios. Evaluated efficacy of basic skills and <br/>
adjusted according to explicit circumstances. (There always seems to <br/>
be opportunity to hone these skills.)<br/>
-Careers: Explored careers in the theater such as acting, set design, <br/>
sound technician, and lighting technician. <br/>
 <br/>
Wow, what a day! Keep in mind that my daughter is only eight years <br/>
old and her friend is just six. And yet there they were seeking out <br/>
all sorts of new information. They were soaking it up like little <br/>
sponges. Now if I had planned all this out beforehand, it would have <br/>
been a pretty impressive syllabus for one afternoon. Apparently we <br/>
covered an awful lot of `topics.&#39; In fact, if I had written it down <br/>
beforehand, I would have doubted my ability to fit it all in.  It is <br/>
quite a little curriculum the girls built into their day.  But I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to fit anything in. I simply let the day flow. I talked <br/>
with the girls and answered their questions. I kept our pace slow to <br/>
allow for observation. I acted silly and posed some thought provoking <br/>
questions. I did what any parent would do with two bright, <br/>
thoughtful, eager learners. <br/>
<br/>
If you have never attempted that convoluted language of the schools <br/>
you might like to try it sometime. You will undoubtedly impress <br/>
yourself with how much of what the schools work so hard to accomplish <br/>
can be handled by two little girls in just one afternoon of play.  <br/>
Your syllabus will of course be different than theirs. That is the <br/>
beauty of self-directed learning, it suits the learner not the <br/>
teacher. But the learning will be there.  It will be surrounded by <br/>
joy, excitement and laughter. Because in the words of author James <br/>
Barrie &quot;The most wasted day of all is that in which we have not <br/>
laughed.&quot;<br/>

Somehow, that is what I was trying to say but didn&#39;t chose the best words to <br/>
express it. &lt;g&gt;  My husband is so skeptical that he looks for me to explain <br/>
everything in educational *lesson-learned* mode.  Makes it difficult to lose <br/>
the terms, even if you don&#39;t always identify with them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t find your original post.  I would LOVE a site where everyone <br/>
shared their life like that.  Especially for us new to this <br/>
lifestyle.  Seeing how others do it, makes it clearer where it is <br/>
happening in your own life!  I don&#39;t know if I can be of any help but <br/>
let me know if you can find some use for me!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I looked up RV&#39;s for my family to go to the conference(we have a <br/>
wedding in CT the following weekend so we had to go up anyway)  <br/>
www.cruiseamerica.com had some specials.  From Florida or Louisana it <br/>
was get 7 days and get 7 more free (about $1000).  Now, you may need <br/>
to purchase additional miles and they charge you per hour for the <br/>
generator running so I am sure that will add up.  However, we are <br/>
weighing all that right now.  I personally think that is the ultimate <br/>
family unschooling vacation!!<br/>
<br/>
Another BTW, you mentioned the thinkpad for your daugther.  It <br/>
depends on her personality.  My son has a computer.  I debated for <br/>
over a year on the leap pad system.  He kept bugging me so finally I <br/>
gave in.  I figured even if he uses it in the car?? Right??  Wrong.  <br/>
Never touches the thing!!!  I think after the animations in the <br/>
computer or the personal interaction of reading to him it just <br/>
doesn&#39;t do it.  On the other hand my friends son, also 4 1/2 loves <br/>
his but he does not have his own computer.  Just a note, the books <br/>
are expensive and rarely on sale, $15 each.  Computer games can <br/>
always be gotten cheaply.  I liked the fact that the reading was so <br/>
close to real reading but the words can read wrong.  So all in all, <br/>
if you know someone who has one, see if you could borrow it!!  If you <br/>
lived here I would be happy to lend you mine!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you at the conference, I always enjoy your posts!<br/>
<br/>

She who laughs...lasts!! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251086730">Thank you Olga!  I think we&#39;ve decided against RV&#39;ing.  I did check into it <br/>
briefly and it seems *very* expensive considering the size we&#39;d need and the <br/>
length of travel.  There&#39;s also still the issue of seatbelts for car seats, <br/>
etc.  Maybe once the kids are a little older.<br/>
<br/>
We got ahold of a Think Pad and I think we may put one on the list.  The <br/>
kids really seemed to enjoy it and with 7, surely the money won&#39;t be wasted! <br/>
  If anything, my boys (almost 2 and 3) will enjoy the noise it makes! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still working out the details of how I&#39;m going to put together a <br/>
webpage/group for unschooling examples, but I will definitely let you know <br/>
once it is up!  Thanks for your interest!<br/>
