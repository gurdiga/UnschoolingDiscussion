<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658595632"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Unschooling isn&#39;t really just about education, is it?  It is really<br/>
&gt;about respecting a child&#39;s right and *need* to learn in a way that is<br/>
&gt;meaningful to him, and giving him an environment that provides<br/>
&gt;opportunities for learning; and it&#39;s about letting go of preconceived<br/>
&gt;ideas about how children learn; and it&#39;s about abandoning what<br/>
&gt;schools have brainwashed parents into thinking is &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>
&gt;What schools have really done is tell parents, &quot;We have decided this<br/>
&gt;type of information is valuable for your children to know, and by<br/>
&gt;golly, we&#39;ll make sure they learn it, whether they like it or not.&quot;<br/>
&gt;NOWHERE is this more prevalent than in the area of special education.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Sometime during the *discussion*, I remember yelling at them that he <br/>
&gt;&gt;wasn&#39;t a trained monkey, and did anybody wonder whether he wanted to touch <br/>
&gt;&gt;the damn switch or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
