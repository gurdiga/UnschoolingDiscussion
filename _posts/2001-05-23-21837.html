If you were to leave the meat out of the Pope&#39;s lasagne during lent, would <br/>
that be acting like you knew something that was no business of yours to know <br/>
(if you&#39;re not Catholic)?  I think it would be courtesy.  And I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s secret that going without meat sometimes was Catholic dogma until the <br/>
mid 1960&#39;s and is still practiced by many conservative Catholics.  I know we <br/>
had fishsticks or cheese pizza at my school ALWAYS, Vatican II or no Vatican <br/>
II, it being a Catholic town in the extreme.  It was lonely being a Baptist <br/>
sometimes. &lt;g&gt;  (But we had Glorieta just an hour away...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47678635">Are you planning to sell it as authentic Italian lasagne, or keep it as a <br/>
family recipe?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone was complaining about this woman doing her own thing, <br/>
but as marketing it as something it&#39;s not.<br/>
