<div id="ygrps-yiv-629805568">My little local school district is asking parents to donate $40 for each day of school their child misses - excused or unexcused. <br/>
<br/>
We live 10 minutes from Disneyland - and every year the principals of all the local schools give the parents the big &quot;talk&quot; about how it may be nice to go to Disneyland on a school day, when the crowds are thinner, but how it costs the school money when the kids aren&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
Guess they expect parents to add $40 to the price of Disneyland - and fork that over to the school &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I do not think parents are going to be standing in line to VOLUNTARILY give $40 to the school when their kid is out sick OR when they&#39;ve gone on a school-day vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry - this is about schools and not about unschooling, but I just think that the whole thing shows how totally out of touch the school adminitrators are and how they do NOT view the rest of life outside of school time as valuable learning time (because the school doesn&#39;t get financed for it).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379370430">I once read of a business that allowed workers to once a year call in <br/>
and say &quot;it&#39;s too nice to come to work today&quot;. I always thought that was <br/>
a great idea - must have been great for worker morale to know that at <br/>
least once a year, you could do that. Maybe these schools should allow a <br/>
&quot;disney day&quot;. (won&#39;t happen, but isn&#39;t it a good idea? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big fan of the olympics. When the olympics were in japan, a <br/>
married couple - journalists for the network - took their kids out of <br/>
school and took them to Japan. What a great experience that must have <br/>
been (but horror - they missed school to go to Japan!). The mom-reporter <br/>
talked about how great it had been for her kids. I had thought that was <br/>
great and wondered about the journalists whose kids were at home, going <br/>
to school, watching mom or dad have a great time in Japan, at the <br/>
olympics. Why do so many schools think that you can&#39;t learn stuff <br/>
outside of their buildings, their supervision?<br/>
<br/>
well, as the yellow buses roll on through, we&#39;re off to the beach for <br/>
our not back to school party. Have a great day, folks!<br/>

Many people wouldn&#39;t like it.  They LIKE rules.  They WANT to be able to <br/>
whine &quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot;   But the simple truth is that IF a company allows <br/>
employees to use their own judgment, they see which ones have good judgment.  AND <br/>
it&#39;s BIG and not so simple truth that what is too many sick days for one person <br/>
isn&#39;t going to be the same number as for another person.  A really valuable, <br/>
quick, responsible employee can miss more work with less irritation than one <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035261301">I went once during the Christmas breas--but not the last day of vacation. It was a little drizzly, but not cold; really beautiful weather--springtime anywhere else. There were<br/>
NO lines, and you know what? I FINISHED! Shortly after dusk I was done--there was nothing else left I wanted to ride, or ride again. I went home (MIL&#39;s house, where I&#39;d ditched<br/>
dh because they were both claiming they&#39;d only *drag* themselves along with me, so I left before they woke up). Unfortunately, MIL no longer lives there, so we won&#39;t be able to<br/>
make it this year.<br/>

But I suppose the school can&#39;t posibly see what kids could learn at<br/>
Disneyland.  You know, when my son didn&#39;t go to preschool, one of the things<br/>
everybody seemed to ask about was how he&#39;d learn &quot;social skills&quot; like<br/>
standing in line and taking turns.  We went to Disneyland that year.  He<br/>
certainly learned to stand in line, even if he learned nothing else there!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In California, all the tax money goes to the state level and then the state doles it out to the local school districts which dole it out to the individual schools.<br/>
<br/>
How much a school gets depends on daily attendance at that school. It used to be that an excused absence didn&#39;t keep the school from getting money from the state for that absent student, but they changed that a few years ago and now the state only gives money based on the number of students actually in attendance - excused or unexcused doesn&#39;t matter - if they aren&#39;t there, they cost there the school doesn&#39;t get money for them from the state.<br/>
<br/>
So - the principals used to tell the parents to lie if they went to Disneyland - give some acceptable excuse so the school would still get their attendance money. But now they don&#39;t get the money anyway - whether the absence is excused or not.<br/>
<br/>
By the way - excused absence means the teachers are required to allow the child to make up work - can&#39;t give them zero on a missed exam, for example. An unexcused absense means the teacher is not supposed to allow the child to make up missed work and the child receives a zero on anything they missed.<br/>

*******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
It is dumb and greedy, but schools DO loose money when kids miss school. They <br/>
depend on federal and state money and the money is allocated by census. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean enrollment by September 1st, in some (many?) areas, <br/>
it is doled out by day to day head-count. It is that way in our area, but <br/>
schools here aren&#39;t charging per diem. Yet.<br/>

&lt;California Adventure much more so than DL. So maybe we should give it a<br/>

Shannon, let me know when you are coming. We have annual passes which we<br/>

&gt; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean enrollment by September 1st, in some (many?) areas,<br/>
&gt; it is doled out by day to day head-count. It is that way in our area, but<br/>
&gt; schools here aren&#39;t charging per diem. Yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow.  Wierd.  Learn something every day.  I&#39;ve never heard of that.  Schools<br/>
here don&#39;t lose money for missed days, but then again, we&#39;re a wierd<br/>
situation, being military and all.  Totally new concept to me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the simple truth is that IF a company allows<br/>
&gt; employees to use their own judgment, they see which ones have good judgment.<br/>
&gt; AND <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s BIG and not so simple truth that what is too many sick days for one<br/>
&gt; person <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t going to be the same number as for another person.  A really valuable,<br/>
&gt; quick, responsible employee can miss more work with less irritation than one<br/>
&gt; who drags and shirks.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not only that, but some people have sick &quot;years&quot; where they catch a bunch of<br/>
colds and have the flu, and then they&#39;ll be healthy for the next several<br/>
years.  Some people just don&#39;t get sick.<br/>
<br/>
I know I always busted my buns to catch up on work after a sick day or two,<br/>
so I wasn&#39;t a burden to my co-workers.  And I was willing to help them out<br/>
when they needed it, because I knew they&#39;d covered for me.<br/>
<br/>
Funny idea, isn&#39;t it?  Treating people with respect, and they&#39;ll treat<br/>
others the same way.  Hmmmmm....  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

be Dec 4-7 while going to the parks only the 5 and 6th.  We figured we could<br/>
