<div id="ygrps-yiv-248824107">But he has no patience with them when they start getting off topic and<br/>
fooling around.  He will actually get up<br/>
and walk away if they won&#39;t settle! down.  He doesn&#39;t know how to be a<br/>
kid.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this subject was a few days ago (we&#39;ve been gone for a long<br/>
weekend and I am now sitting here catching up), but it did remind me of<br/>
my 7 yo ds&#39;s karate class.  Most of his class is made up of homeschooled<br/>
kids between the ages of 6 and 12.  The kids in the class who are<br/>
unschooled are in the class to learn, they sit and watch, they listen<br/>
with respect, and they are the ones who practice at home.  The kids who<br/>
are not unschooled, even though they technically don&#39;t go to school,<br/>
spend most of the time socializing with each other.  It drives my son<br/>
crazy!  I like the explanation given by someone that there schooling is<br/>
rigid and they are blowing off some steam. I&#39;m going to use it the next<br/>
time my son leaves the floor because his friends want to use this time<br/>
to visit.<br/>
