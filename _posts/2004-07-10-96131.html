<div id="ygrps-yiv-67044662">&lt;&lt; My son, the former sixth grader, still occasionally rants at her <br/>
about it, and about how she holds her silverware! Both kids may never <br/>
completely recover from &quot;school.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a school issue.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no sense letting a little boy rant at her, but couldn&#39;t you talk to <br/>
her about the silverware?    When kids don&#39;t know enough table etiquette to eat <br/>
at a nice restaurant, it&#39;s not a good thing.   Sometimes people are invited <br/>
to banquets, at least for weddings but sometimes for social or political <br/>
purposes, and it&#39;s nice if they know what to do with two forks, where to put the <br/>
knife, how to use a breadplate and so forth.  And I think it starts with knowing <br/>
how to use a spoon for cereal and soup.  <br/>
<br/>
Some families don&#39;t even ask their kids to eat with their mouths closed.   <br/>
Someone will ask them later, and it might be the potential housemate or love <br/>
interest, in listing the reasons for not wanting to be with the person.   <br/>
<br/>
Some things, like courtesy with bathroom sharing and eating and not leaving d<br/>
irty clothes where others have to walk (dangerous for the walker, bad for the <br/>
clothes, bad for the relationship) and not leaving the mik out to go bad, or <br/>
the bread bag open for the bread to dry out or get soggy (depending where the <br/>
bread is)...  Those aren&#39;t the kinds of choices that are good to encourage.   <br/>
<br/>
The days of people using pencils for money (bookkeeping by hand, clerical <br/>
work by hand) are pretty much gone, and so how a person holds a pencil is minor <br/>
in the day of keyboard/computer/data entry.   But spoons and forks are still <br/>
commonly used at every meal.<br/>
<br/>
If I moved to Japan, I&#39;d really have to practice using chopsticks before I <br/>
could eat in a formal situation.   But I&#39;d expect people who grew up there to <br/>
just know, and do it &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I moved to a place where they eat with pieces of flatbread, same thing.  <br/>
I&#39;d have to forget what I know about forks, and figure out how to eat politely <br/>
their-style.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty and I was coaching Holly about NOT mentioning to a man (her <br/>
dad, in this case) that his hair was getting thin up top.   What they can&#39;t see <br/>
doesn&#39;t hurt them, just don&#39;t talk about it.  She was skeptical, but we <br/>
pressed that if she didn&#39;t understand it, just trust us and never to ANYone say <br/>
anything like that.   Marty, who often has his head shaved, said he would <br/>
probably feel bad when he started balding, because when he goes bald now, it&#39;s out of <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
If someone never eats with the mayor or with the 2012 governor&#39;s council on <br/>
natural learning, it would be nice if it was because they just didn&#39;t want to, <br/>
not because they had never learned to hold a fork.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971509159">I have a funny related story.  For background you need to know that my dh<br/>
sometimes used phrases like...&quot;that guy was two cans short of a six pack&quot; or<br/>
&quot;missing a couple of limbs off his tree&quot; when someone does something stupid<br/>
esp. with regards to driving or politics.  A year or two ago when Lilly was<br/>
5 or 6 she took a close look at the to of dh&#39;s head and said with regards to<br/>
the top of his head, &quot;Daddy, I think your a few pupils short of a<br/>
schoolhouse.&quot;  I almost broke a gut laughing over that one. <br/>
 <br/>
A little more on-topic, I think that it&#39;s important at some point to show<br/>
your children how to eat using common etiquette but I think that many people<br/>
really over do table manners rules at home.  Home should be where you can<br/>
eat and relax and not worry about someone correcting you, as long as your<br/>
not being overtly offensive. i.e.. picking your nose or some other<br/>
disgusting habit.    We&#39;ve always taken our children out to eat and we eat<br/>
more formally in a restaurant than we do at home.  It seemed like the kids<br/>
picked up on this at a young age and we gently remind them if things get out<br/>
of hand that we are dining in a public place and we need to act<br/>
respectfully.  They learned how to hold a fork by watching us so that&#39;s<br/>
never been an issue.  <br/>

&gt;{{That&#39;s not a school issue.}}<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;school&quot; aspect I&#39;m referring to is the philosophy of the &quot;one and only <br/>
right way&quot; and the constant criticism she experienced doing it the &quot;wrong&quot; <br/>
way.  My son (now 16and 6&#39;..no &#39;little kid&#39; kid but a very physically <br/>
intimidating soul) in his endearing sibling way continues to remind her of <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; way to do things.  (Whole &#39;nother subject and issue...what&#39;s <br/>
going on between them...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s no sense letting a little boy rant at her, but couldn&#39;t you talk <br/>
to her about the silverware?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old daughter can hold a fork just fine.  It&#39;s wielding a knife <br/>
that she has problems with.  She holds it in her fist at a &quot;different&quot; <br/>
angle.  She abhors being corrected about ANYTHING!!!!! (Again, because of <br/>
the pencil and school thing.)  So I don&#39;t anymore.  I just occasionally <br/>
indicate the other way to hold a knife.  I figure she&#39;ll get where she <br/>
needs to be when she needs to.  Doesn&#39;t bother me.  It isn&#39;t messy or <br/>
anything unsightly.  But it isn&#39;t successful.  She&#39;ll work on it in her own <br/>
way as she has most things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;    When kids don&#39;t know enough table etiquette to eat at a nice <br/>

&gt;learned to hold a fork.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed, and thanks for the concern.  It&#39;s not about learning how to hold a <br/>
knife.  To her it&#39;s about learning to do it &quot;her own way.&quot;  She sees what <br/>
she sees.  She knows the difference.  We&#39;ve &quot;been there.&quot;  It&#39;s the <br/>
criticism, and the correction she simply cannot handle from outside <br/>
sources. Knowing that she is doing it differently, of course, just <br/>
compounds the sensitivity of the issue since it makes her very shy about <br/>
practicing and even more touchy.  Had she not been made aware of all these <br/>
&quot;differences,&quot; maybe there wouldn&#39;t have been, or not for as long?  or <br/>
whatever...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389451819">Sadly I must add that some of these issues do not come from school.<br/>
My daughter never went to school and I am not overly critical of her <br/>
but she is strong willed and opionated {grumbles something about sins <br/>
of the mother} LOL so sometimes I can&#39;t tell her anything or help her <br/>
with anything ie. how to use a knife for more than just sliding the <br/>
food around on her plate.....<br/>
<br/>
She just has this wall up that says she wants to be a Big Girl <br/>
without any help when clearly she needs some help or indeed has never <br/>
been given any instruction in an area and isn&#39;t mastering it on her <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
I find these struggles agonizing but I am learning to let go and try <br/>
to just talk to her about why I want to help and how she can receive <br/>
help in the way of instruction from me without giving up control or <br/>
the ability to try new things on her own succeed or fail.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these are just normal parenting issues some of us have to face <br/>
is how I look at it.<br/>

My 20 yr. old son&#39;s last THREE girlfriends had problems with silverware and  <br/>
not being able to cut their own meat at dinner.  All were from very well to  <br/>
do million dollar home type families, one is the daughter of a politician  even.<br/>
 <br/>
You would think they could use a knife at the table without  embarrassment.  <br/>
No one in my family embarrassed them about it, but you  could tell asking John <br/>
to cut their meat after a struggle with it on the plate  was embarrassing to <br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it was simply clearly a lack of practice or having a parent do it  <br/>
for them.  They all learned after some time of family dinners and were  using a <br/>
knife very well before they moved on to different young men.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We eat dinner together every night, knives are used almost every  meal.  Not <br/>
some stuffy requirement but just are there.  My kids have  had the practice.  <br/>
Other families that don&#39;t have big family meals all the  time don&#39;t get the <br/>
same experience.<br/>
 <br/>
Just like everything else in life, when the need presents itself, one will  <br/>
learn to use the knife and fork IF it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
