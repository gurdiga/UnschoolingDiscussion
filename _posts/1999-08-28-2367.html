Well said, very well said.� I could not of said it better.� One question to you and<br/>
everyone else, how do you cope with frustration when your child wants to do<br/>
everything opposite of what you are trying to accomplish for the day?� I have one 5<br/>
1/2 year old girl and I think she is going through &quot;school&quot; withdrawl.� Most of her<br/>
friends have started kindergarten this week, so we have just been going with the<br/>
flow.<br/>
Thanks for any imput.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Personally, I do NOT understand why people have kids and then leave them in<br/>
&gt; daycare for 10+ hours a day.� This makes no sense....get them up early, drop<br/>
&gt; them at daycare, pick them up after work, stuff some dinner into them and<br/>
&gt; put them in bed.� I do NOT understand why people have kids when they do not<br/>
&gt; intend to ever be with them!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe if you choose to have children you should realize this is a HUGE<br/>
&gt; committment....both in time and energy.� I would NEVER have had kids if I<br/>
&gt; KNEW I was going to place them into someone else&#39;s hands five days a week,<br/>
&gt; 10-12 hours a day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do realize that some families have children, intending for one parent to<br/>
&gt; be home with them....then something happens and the parents must work.� I am<br/>
&gt; not speaking of these families.� I have so many relatives that work to<br/>
&gt; supply the THINGS they WANT in their lives.� When all is said and done, it<br/>
&gt; does not matter how big your house is, how many fancy cars you have.� I<br/>
&gt; believe what matters is how you have raised your children.� If you child is<br/>
&gt; with someone for the majority of their waking hours, he/she will learn the<br/>
&gt; values of the person they are with , NOT their parents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it is pretty sad when a baby knows a caretaker better than her/his<br/>
&gt; own parents.� I have seen this over and over.....I watched a little girl for<br/>
&gt; 50+ hours a week.� One weekend, I was at THEIR home for a party...the little<br/>
&gt; girl fell....she would NOT go to her parents for comfort...she came to ME.<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t there something wrong with that picture?� I suppose I should have been<br/>
&gt; flattered that this little one trusted me so much...but shouldn&#39;t it be her<br/>
&gt; MOTHER or FATHER that she seeks out for comfort?� Incidentally...the mom<br/>
&gt; quit her job three weeks later to be with her daughter!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, not everyone is cut out to be a full time mom or dad.� But I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; everyone is cut out to be a parent either.� I am blessed to have been able<br/>
&gt; to be home with my children for the last ten and a half years.� I am given<br/>
&gt; the full support of my husband....this is where I belong.� Never, ever,<br/>
&gt; would I give my &#39;job&#39; to someone else!!� When people ask me &quot;When are you<br/>
&gt; going to get a job?&quot;� I remind them firmly that I HAVE a job...it is just<br/>
&gt; not paid in the traditional way!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Have a good day!!<br/>

Gee, Karen, have you forgotten where most children come from? Rather, WHY most children come? It is a mistake, an error, an accident. Most children are not planned, and something in me says we push each other around something awful. Darned if we do and darned if we dont. Lots of people do not want children. Abortion, though legal, is frowned upon. Responsibility is out of fashion. So ------- babies are born! We who love our children and we who LIKE our children, even we who VALUE our children are not necessarily the majority. But we ARE the lucky ones, the blessed ones. We can certainly celebrate THAT, cant we? <br/>
<br/>
. . . . Elizabeth: I&#39;m interested in the apprenticeship question too. I&#39;m curious to see the responses you get. . . .  Beth O in IL<br/>
OSHA happened to the apprenticeship, or at least to the allowing of the youngsters to work around hazardous machinery. The apprenticeship was gone long before that, however, when the society became affluent enough to allow children to stay in school years longer and longer. Society moved ages back to match the needs. Schools slowed down  to snails pace in some cases!<br/>
