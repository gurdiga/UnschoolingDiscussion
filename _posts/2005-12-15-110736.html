<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679134362">Hi Jaiden(7) just bought Jak3 last night and has been playing it almost <br/>
nonstop since last night, he is having a small problem.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t figure out how to turn Jak into Light Jak, the book says when <br/>
the meter has any amount of light eco press the L2 and function button <br/>
(o or x...) and that should bring out Light Jak, so far, it&#39;s not <br/>
working and he&#39;s getting upset. Are we doing something wrong? <br/>
<br/>
Anybody know?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx!<br/>

 I asked my son Sett, and he said Jak needs to have a full light eco meter first and that you <br/>
need to press the L2 and the o or x (he wasn&#39;t sure which one it was) at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps :)<br/>

We&#39;ve been trying that, do you know if you have to have all of the dark <br/>
eco powers before you can get the light ones?<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>
