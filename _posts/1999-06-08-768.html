<div id="ygrps-yiv-789197433">&quot;If an experience is delightful or pleasant, usually we want to grab it and <br/>
make it last.  We&#39;re afraid that it will end.  We&#39;re not inclined to share <br/>
it.  The lojong teachings encourage us, if we enjoy what we are experiencing, <br/>
to think of other people and wish for them to feel that.  Share the wealth.  <br/>
Be generous with your joy.  Give away what you most want.  Be generous with <br/>
your insights and delights.  Instead of fearing that they&#39;re going to slip <br/>
away and holding on to them, share them.&quot;    --Pema Chodron, from _Start <br/>
Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living_<br/>
<br/>
I quoted that to go with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Gramma said when you come on something good, <br/>
 first thing to do is share it with whoever you can find; that way, the good <br/>
 spreads out where no telling it will go. Which is right. &gt;&gt;  and I&#39;m sorry <br/>
my first two attempts were prematurely launched.<br/>
