Good for you! Serves him right. Just totally irritates me when people will<br/>
not be respectful of others and their needs. I would not have cleaned it up,<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve popped a squat many times when I had to, always discreetly, and only <br/>
when it was a necessity.  I have 2 sisters, no brothers.  We camped, played in <br/>
the woods, and also had a place on the lake with no indoor plumbing.  My <br/>
girls have occasionally popped a squat in urgent situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here follows more than most people need to know, but honestly it could help <br/>
someone someday a little perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always amazed when someone says they&#39;ve never gone outside, but then I&#39;ve <br/>
spent a lot of time in automobiles in western states, and sometimes in <br/>
southern New Mexico or Utah, if you&#39;re going to go, you&#39;re going to go behind a bush <br/>
(if you&#39;re lucky) at the side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
Guys are surprised that women have to calculate the angle of the hill, and <br/>
somewhat gauge the consistency of the dirt.<br/>
<br/>
And once when the snow was deep and we were having to go slow in the <br/>
mountains around Price in Utah, we learned that if you open both doors it makes a <br/>
little stall for a person sitting on the edge of the doorframe (don&#39;t know how to <br/>
say what used to be &quot;running board&quot;) and if another person also has to go, <br/>
move the car up a few car lengths and you have a whole new toilet.<br/>
<br/>
Others just look the other way.  (We just told that story to Holly last week, <br/>
for some reason.  It happened before we had kids, and there were three people <br/>
in the car, me being the only female.)<br/>
<br/>
It was way better than any alternatives we could think of.<br/>
<br/>
Once in Nevada in broad daylight with nothing in sight for as far as we could <br/>
see on the flat in any direction, I really had to pee.<br/>
<br/>
No car was visible.  I got on a big flat rock.  (No bush was visible, forgot <br/>
to mention.)<br/>
The pee didn&#39;t run off the rock.  It was soaking in and evaporating faster <br/>
than it could run off.   A truck driver was coming and I could&#39;ve hurried, but I <br/>
thought, &quot;This guy has peed on a rock many times, and he&#39;ll never see me <br/>
again anyway.&quot;<br/>

Unless you count when I was 3 and 4, going outside along the road with a<br/>
potty chair, I&#39;ve never gone outside. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever been a postion<br/>
where I had to. Don&#39;t think I want to be ther either!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826807384">I&#39;ll never forget the look on Paul&#39;s face when we were dating. His parents live in an area called &quot;Back Swamp&quot; outside of Richlands, NC. We had this spot off the road down dirt track where we&#39;d go parking...one night, having forgotten to go before leaving his parents&#39; house, I excused myself and got out of the truck...took my purse and walked off a ways, did my business and cleaned up with a wet-wipe. I came back in the truck and Paul was like &quot;Did you just go?&quot; I was &quot;Yeah, what&#39;d you think I did?!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He said I was the only women he&#39;d ever dated who felt at home in the woods enough to just go take care of their business, let alone who carried wet-wipes and a plastic baggie in their purse just specifically for that purpose! I said &quot;Well, I was a Girl Scout, I love camping, etc. and you never know when you might really have to go and there not be a bathroom around. Best to be prepared. Semper Paratus and all that! (LOL he got a kick out of me saying that, as it&#39;s the motto of the Coast Guard and we were both on active-duty at that point). <br/>
<br/>
However...as we got married, we stopped hanging out in the woods so much. 9 years, 3 children and a pregnancy later and I&#39;ve badgered the heck out of him last summer to start taking the kids for hikes at a local state park. We&#39;re walking along the bike path since we had the stroller for Megan as she as only about 18 months old at that time...I had to go, BAD, and there wasn&#39;t anything around so I just said hold on a sec, and headed off behind a tree and did my business. <br/>
<br/>
I came back and Paul, once again, was wide-eyed. I reminded him first of all of the Baby sitting on my bladder, then of when we were dating and he was like &quot;Oh yeah&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Both of us were a little perturbed to realize just how much we&#39;d lost ourselves over the years, especially me. <br/>

<h4>The Bucknum&#39;s</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645422059">No car was visible.  I got on a big flat rock.  (No bush was visible, forgot <br/>
to mention.)<br/>
The pee didn&#39;t run off the rock.  It was soaking in and evaporating faster <br/>
than it could run off.   A truck driver was coming and I could&#39;ve hurried, but I <br/>
thought, &quot;This guy has peed on a rock many times, and he&#39;ll never see me <br/>
again anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ha!  You crack me up.  This reminds me of the time I got caught so to speak.  It was downtown in a parking garage.  It was late and I was pregnant having no idea where we might find a bathroom I slipped behind a parked car.  That&#39;s when we heard a group of people walking up the ramp from a lower level.  My girlfriend pretended to be looking for her keys in her hand bag and noticed my little stream flowing down hill and started laughing.  The group of people suddenly went sighlent and continued on past and quickly got into there car and closed the doors.  We could still hear them giggling and squealing though.  Anyway it wasn&#39;t until telling my story to some friends years latter that I realized that the reason they stopped talking was because they entered the parking level at a lower height and could *see* me peeing from under the car.  AHHHHH!  I&#39;m just glad none of them would ever be able to recognise me.<br/>

I was extremely tipsy (alright I was plastered many years ago and I don&#39;t get like that now &lt;g&gt;) at a camping party.  Picture the camp fire.  Picture the &#39;20 somethings&#39; talking, drinking, toasting their eyeballs.  Picture me dropping my shorts, sitting on a rock and peeing down hill into my shorts, right next to the campfire in full view of everyone.  Now picture not very nurturing exhubby pitching me into the tent in disgust.  Exhubby and drinking to excess are a thing of the past but the memory lingers on..<br/>

And some laws aren&#39;t that sensible.  People are very capable of urinating in<br/>
private...in public....you know &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I have been working for several years to follow principles not rules (laws).<br/>
Sometimes I do break laws for the better good (2 mothers of &quot;failure to<br/>
thrive&quot; newborns get goat milk from us which is technically illegal, but<br/>
goat milk is more nutrient dense than even human breast milk).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I break laws because I believe that I should be the final<br/>
authority on my life ( I&#39;ve drank alcohol since I was 13)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I follow the law religiously because it is a good law (I report<br/>
situations that are dangerous to kids if talking to the adults involved has<br/>
been fruitless)<br/>

because she figured that truck driver had peed on a rock before <br/>
too. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
I can see this turning into a huge issue and I don&#39;t want it to be! <br/>
I&#39;m not criticizing, I&#39;m admiring.  lol  I have NO problem with <br/>
anyone peeing on a rock on the side of the road.  I have gone into <br/>
the woods to pee before and thought *that* was radical.   <br/>
<br/>
But for someone to not care that a truck driver might see me peeing <br/>
on a rock is REALLY cool.  More cool than I could be because I&#39;d be <br/>
scared he&#39;d call the cops. ;)  <br/>

I don&#39;t care if a truck driver sees you peeing on a rock.  ; )<br/>
<br/>
My friend Pat Hatmaker learned to pee in a pop can when she was out<br/>
flying with her boyfriend.  I thought that was impressive.   I flew with<br/>
a boyfriend once or twice but that was a drug induced flying and as far<br/>
as I can remember I didn&#39;t pee anywhere I wasn&#39;t supposed to.  <br/>

&gt; ***But for someone to not care that a truck driver might see me peeing<br/>
&gt; on a rock is REALLY cool***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care if a truck driver sees you peeing on a rock.  ; )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My friend Pat Hatmaker learned to pee in a pop can when she was out<br/>
&gt; flying with her boyfriend.  I thought that was impressive.   I flew with<br/>
&gt; a boyfriend once or twice but that was a drug induced flying and as far<br/>
&gt; as I can remember I didn&#39;t pee anywhere I wasn&#39;t supposed to.<br/>

Ok, forgive me for my hyper-cautiousness and conservative roots are <br/>

Guys get arrested for peeing alongside the road (exposing themselves) <br/>

<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
<br/>
Men don&#39;t expose themselves peeing alongside the roadside the way we&#39;re <br/>
talking about--highway 50 miles from a town with nothing but cactus (if even that).<br/>
<br/>
Peeing by the roadside downtown outside a hotel or office building, yeah I <br/>
guess that could get a guy arrested.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, where do you live that you&#39;re thinking a mom will get arrested for <br/>
peeing by the side of a highway in Nevada?<br/>
