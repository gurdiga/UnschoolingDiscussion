<div id="ygrps-yiv-748166854">Or perhaps it is better to call it at your own pace reading? I am really<br/>
starting to dislike, intensely, such terms as early and late.  Can you<br/>
imagine if we did this with music and trampoline jumping?  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, by most standards, my child is considered a late reader; she just<br/>
couldn&#39;t get it, got frustrated, mom pushed to much (admission), etc. etc. <br/>
Finally back off, and within the last few months her reading has taken off. <br/>
She found books she likes to read (Half-magic, and Getting to Know guides.)<br/>
and is reading at least on level with others her age.  I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised if she surpasses others her age in a few months.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a sleep deprived response to those whose children read late, but<br/>
still aren&#39;t into it.  Maybe they will be next year, maybe they won&#39;t be<br/>
next year... the same is true of early readers.  As long as they eventually<br/>
can read well enough to do what they want to do, there is nothing imho, to<br/>
worry about.<br/>
<br/>
My parents are now firm supporters of unschooling...I had trouble explaining<br/>
it but apparently what I gave them to read did a good enough job and now<br/>
they are full of enthusasim, bragging to my sister about how well it works..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
go figure!<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

never clear! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

frustration for both parent and child.  BUT__ it is harder that one thinks to <br/>

of difference how they perceive their intellect.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Can you<br/>

<br/>
I was a very early musician but am profoundly disabled at trampolining!! <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s reading The Boxcar Children.  Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When the <br/>
child is 16 it will make no difference when they read, BUT it will make a lot <br/>
of difference how they perceive their intellect.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My famous example of Liam McClure (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> and it&#39;s <br/>
also in the library at www.unschooling.com) is a good one of a family that <br/>
somehow managed to keep their kids confident even though their reading came <br/>
late.  Liam can do some physical things as well as grown men who work really <br/>
hard and spend a lot of money on coaches to do.  (Well, at 18 Liam&#39;s getting <br/>
to grown-man stage, but I mean he has for years.)   And I think that helped.  <br/>
And he knew his dad had read late and with much difficulty, but his dad reads <br/>
well now, and is a manly ex-marine, fireman and bicycle racer.  So both his pa<br/>
rents told him &quot;It will come,&quot; and &quot;At least you&#39;re not in school having <br/>
people bug you about it all the time.&quot;   And they gave him real <br/>
responsibilities and asked his opinion about things.  They treated him like a <br/>
valuable person, and he was and IS a valuable person.  And now he reads.<br/>

push their kids to read so their perception of their own intellect at <br/>
age 16 will somehow be better? Or did I miss something?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020632152">My intent was tao point out that if you push your child and he or she faills, <br/>
it might create a self concept of failure, however if you just let it happen <br/>
the child will feel right on target and never doubt his sucess<br/>

forgot this time.  At your own pace is a bit of a mouthful.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
