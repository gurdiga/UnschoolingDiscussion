<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 8 Feb 2003, at  9:53am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852817176">Thank you all for your suggestions and explanations of unschooling and all the different things we&#39;ve talked about.  Its been a fascinating conversation with lots of leads in lots of areas.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot, and found some areas where, for whatever reason,  I wasn&#39;t clear on what unschooling was.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you also for your support while I figured out what to do about the &quot;school&quot; / &quot;unschool&quot; issue as it applies to math  right now.<br/>
<br/>
I feel much better now letting go of it all.  Since I am a product of public school I&#39;m sure there are lots of things that will come up with regard to old ways of thinking.  I&#39;m guessing its a never ending process.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I feel as though I&#39;m spending a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to make myself clear.  And it seems that my questions make others feel the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that is overextending the purpose of this particular list, but it appears that it might be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to give it a rest now, and go think about other things.<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
