<div id="ygrps-yiv-978219225">For the Washingtonians on this list (or any visitors heading up my <br/>
way!)<br/>
<br/>
You are all invited to a book party to celebrate publication of my <br/>
new book &quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot;, and two <br/>
storytelling books &quot;The Healing Heart~Families&quot; and &quot;The Healing <br/>
Heart~Communities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It will take place Saturday evening, April 19th, at the Friends <br/>
Meeting House, 219 B Street, Tumwater. There will be some <br/>
storytelling (3 tellers, I think), a display of the cover art from <br/>
the book cover contest -- we received submissions from as far away as <br/>
Natal, South Africa, and Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, and of course books <br/>
for sale. (you can see the finalists on my website at <br/>
www.skylarksings.com)<br/>
<br/>
Dessert potluck -- bring your favorite. Kids invited of course <br/>
(someone&#39;s gotta eat!)<br/>
<br/>
If you need more info., call me at 360 352-0506, or send me an e-mail.<br/>
