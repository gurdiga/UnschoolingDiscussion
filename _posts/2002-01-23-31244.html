<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726740385">Here&#39;s an Amazon link to a book that I bought and really like.  If I have<br/>
any complaints, it is that it is a little conservative--which should suit<br/>
most people just fine.  I didn&#39;t find it to be dogmatic, though.  My oldest<br/>
has read most of it.  I think anyone with teens would appreciate it.  The<br/>
first sentence of the editorial review says, &quot;The Teenager&#39;s Guide to the<br/>
Real World starts from the central reality that teenagers get to design<br/>
their own lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Along these same lines, I bought &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective<br/>
Teens&quot; and both my older two have enjoyed that one.<br/>
<br/>
I also like Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books, but I prefer &quot;The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook&quot; over &quot;Real Lives&quot;.<br/>

The link didn&#39;t work. What is the title of the book you were linking <br/>
to?... the one you mentioned?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It was inevitable, huh, Sarah?  I think we can work around it.  ;-)<br/>

I was afraid of that--the link wrapped the way I sent it.  Book title is<br/>
&quot;The Teenager&#39;s Guide to Real Life&quot; by a guy last name &quot;Brain&quot;--Michael, I<br/>
think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079991006">I looked it up on Amazon.  It&#39;s The Teenager&#39;s Guide to the Real World by Marshall Brian.<br/>
<br/>
We are having a blast with the Career Ideas for Kids books.  We got the science and art books out and have ordered the others from the library.  We took a test to determine the areas of interest.  12 yo dd has strong interest in art, computer, science and math.  10 yo dd is into music/dance, science, math.  Tomorrow is going to be career day in our house.  As I type, the kids are going through the books writing down the careers they want to try.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699521447">Sarah, thanks for the tip on the Occupational Outlook Handbook.  I&#39;m sure they would like as much information on this stuff as they can get.  They each picked 8 occupations they want to try out and we haven&#39;t gotten all the books yet.  Come on over and bring some props!<br/>
