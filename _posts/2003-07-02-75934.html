I am interested in hearing a bit more about the choice you made to stay with<br/>
your children.  Specifically, I&#39;m wondering if your children are old enough<br/>
to be alone for the duration of the party but you prefer from a parenting<br/>
style to be with them?  Do your older children ever watch the youngest? Or<br/>
if you might normally have another person stay with your youngest, but did<br/>
not or did not want to do that this time?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.  I have a homeschooling teenager who has been watching my<br/>
children when I have lawyer or other private appointments.  For me, it&#39;s<br/>
easier for 3 dd&#39;s to stay at home because of dietary needs due to allergies<br/>
and less stress while they stay in their own home environment.  Otherwise I<br/>
might sometimes have them visit with another homeschooling family when I<br/>
cannot take dd&#39;s with me.   I find that we genuinely enjoy being together<br/>
and therefore minimize the times that we are apart.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I&#39;m just curious to know if others enjoy the family bond in a way<br/>
that they make choices similar to Sandra&#39;s?  (I realize I don&#39;t know<br/>
Sandra&#39;s reasons yet, just her choice).  How often do you find that you pass<br/>
on an opportunity because it excludes one/some (based on age) or all of your<br/>
children?  Who typically cares for your children at times when you<br/>
absolutely must fulfill an obligation without children with you?<br/>
<br/>
I usually volunteer for my children&#39;s activities such as Girl Scouts.  A<br/>
leader can normally bring the younger children along, otherwise there would<br/>
be no program.  But if I go just as a mom helping out, the younger children<br/>
aren&#39;t allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken children with me at times and noticed that others seem to find<br/>
it inappropriate.  I only have three children, but many people seem<br/>
unaccustomed to having children around and find three extra bodies<br/>
overwhelming.  A snooty lady in a toy store once referred to me and my<br/>
&quot;litter&quot;.  If I or one of my children have a doctor&#39;s appointment, all four<br/>
of us normally go.  People in waiting rooms and the doctor&#39;s staff seem a<br/>
bit unnerve by this at times.  Sometimes the waiting rooms are not large<br/>
enough to accomodate all.  My children are fairly young - almost 11, 8, and<br/>
6.  I suppose it would be a bit odd for a grown woman to have three teenage<br/>
boys tag along!  At any rate I&#39;d like to hear from others with young<br/>
children as to how you handle familylife and childcare challenges.  I&#39;d also<br/>
like to hear from those who have older children - do you just naturally<br/>
transition at some point to a place/time when the children have a<br/>
life/schedule of their own and they don&#39;t mind being at home alone?<br/>

<br/>
Kirby was at work, I didn&#39;t want to commit Marty to being here on a Saturday <br/>
afternoon/night (when we discussed it in advance), I don&#39;t swim, and I don&#39;t <br/>
play volleyball.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone with Keith to a fair number of engineer-staff get-togethers, and <br/>
they&#39;re stunningly dull.  &quot;Stun&quot; like brain-numbing.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also quite a turnover rate in engineering, and invariably when I&#39;ve <br/>
gone to a party and liked someone, he&#39;s gone within a year.  (Maybe it&#39;s ME!   <br/>
Maybe I pick the sparkliest and those are the ones who move on.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do your older children ever watch the youngest? Or<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
not or did not want to do that this time?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been more common with us to leave kids with another family if we go <br/>
somewhere.  That way they&#39;re having fun too.  Sometimes adult childless friends <br/>
have stayed, but we&#39;ve never asked them to do anything dramatic (like make <br/>
food)--they just watch videos or play games with the kids.  It&#39;s been rare, <br/>
overall, that that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they stay alone or two will stay here.   Now they&#39;re all old enough <br/>
to stay, but I&#39;d still prefer they have someone over, even another friend, or <br/>
that they go to a house with a mom and refrigerator and other kids and all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How often do you find that you pass<br/>
<br/>
on an opportunity because it excludes one/some (based on age) or all of your<br/>
<br/>
children?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s just on principle.  Sometimes that&#39;s a beacon indicating that <br/>
the people don&#39;t LIKE kid, and it&#39;s possible they don&#39;t like other adults who <br/>
like kids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The family had six kids.  Keith said there was still a playground in their <br/>
yard with a swingset and a big plastic climbing house, but their two youngest <br/>
are late teens/college, and there #4 was there with his wife.  No grandchildren <br/>
yet that Keith heard reported in the conversations.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;d also<br/>
<br/>
like to hear from those who have older children - do you just naturally<br/>
<br/>
transition at some point to a place/time when the children have a<br/>
<br/>
life/schedule of their own and they don&#39;t mind being at home alone?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it happened with us.<br/>
<br/>
When they were littler (and still, sometimes) my husband and I would not go <br/>
somewhere together (like the store or a movie) just so the kids had the option <br/>
of going with one parent or staying with the other.  Between the two of us, <br/>
the kids had a choice, and then they were real choices, not inconvenience vs. <br/>
&quot;cooperation&quot; as in some situations where what the parent is really asking is <br/>
&quot;Will you go with me peacably or will you be a pain in the ass and cause me to <br/>
have to make other arrangements?&quot;  That&#39;s not a very balanced situation. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
(Been there too!)   But &quot;You can go, or you can stay with dad/mom&quot; isn&#39;t so emot<br/>
ionally charged.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686588090">I normally take my kids with me. We have had to go to the Vet 4 times for a <br/>
new puppy and him being sick on arrival. Nicholas is learning to talk and <br/>
babbled very loudly. Dustin and Cassidy where back and forth into the room. In the <br/>
end it all worked out but it was stressful. I even said something really <br/>
stupid. Tucker (New Brittany) arrived off the plane from breeder with mange. Vat <br/>
asked if any of us where itchy. I said well my belly seems to be but I had a <br/>
baby a year ago so stretch marks you know? When I said this I looked at the <br/>
female assistant and she made a face like I had two heads. LOL I should not have <br/>
said that.<br/>
When I go to baby appointments all three go and it works out. If I have to go <br/>
to Walmart and it can wait I go after Nicholas is in bed and the older two <br/>
insist they go with me. I rarely go anywhere without some or all of my kids. <br/>
Cass 3 is and wanting to control her brother so some times it can be stressful to <br/>
appease her so she doesn&#39;t scream in public. I guess she has figured out that <br/>
when she yells, cries or wines we hop to her even if she is being impossible. <br/>
My thinking is its better to work with her than against her in many <br/>
situations. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense I began an email to the group yesterday and never <br/>
sent it about my 3 yr. old. Maybe I&#39;ll send it later.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I guess I&#39;m just curious to know if others enjoy the family bond in a<br/>
way<br/>
that they make choices similar to Sandra&#39;s?  (I realize I don&#39;t know<br/>
Sandra&#39;s reasons yet, just her choice).  How often do you find that you pass<br/>
on an opportunity because it excludes one/some (based on age) or all of your<br/>
children?  Who typically cares for your children at times when you<br/>
absolutely must fulfill an obligation without children with you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I very rarely go anywhere without at least one child with me. Once in awhile<br/>
I want to go out alone. Sometimes to just be alone but often because I want<br/>
to be quick. When the kids are with me, we always browse, even in the<br/>
grocery store!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa usually wants to go with me. Sierra usually wants to go. Joseph not<br/>
unless we go where there are toys. The grocery store doesn&#39;t count. Tara<br/>
usually does her own thing but if it&#39;s early enough or she doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
work, she&#39;ll join us all. It&#39;s nice because the girls usually want to go<br/>
with her in the store. I get two less kids to keep track of!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t ever think of an opportunity where we didn&#39;t go because of not being<br/>
*allowed* to take the kids. No weddings or picnics or get togethers where I<br/>
was told not to bring them. Then again Joe and I are very informal, making<br/>
our friends the same too. (because they naturally are not because we &quot;make&quot;<br/>
them!)<br/>
<br/>
When I have to go to the vets, the kids usually stay home. It&#39;s hard enough<br/>
with the 2 dogs let alone kids too. If it&#39;s the Dr. then only the sick one<br/>
goes. We are rarely there. If it&#39;s the dentist, then both Sierra and Joseph<br/>
have an appt. and I take Alyssa too. She&#39;ll be going soon enough, why not<br/>
see it&#39;s no big deal?<br/>
<br/>
I rarely have Tara watch the kids. Once in awhile if I have to run out quick<br/>
or Joe and I have to drop something off like a car, Tara is home and we&#39;re<br/>
only gone for minutes. Tara has never watched the kids at night while we<br/>
went out for any reason. She could and we would be very comfortable with<br/>
that, but we get my mom. I don&#39;t want Tara staying home to watch kids. Most<br/>
of the time when we go out, it&#39;s the weekend and Tara is going out too. No<br/>
one but my mom has ever watched the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My inlaws think that&#39;s a bad thing. We all know what I think of them. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Years ago before we moved into our house now, my mom lived in a retirement<br/>
condo community. They had pools and we had none at the time. We would take<br/>
the kids over to swim. Joseph and Sierra were 4 and 5. There was a group of<br/>
women sitting around the pool the first time we went. Older coffee clutch<br/>
looking women. The kids stated getting a bit noisy and I remember telling<br/>
them to not get so loud. One woman heard me and said not to quiet them down<br/>
a bit, she loved hearing the kids scream and laugh and have fun. She said<br/>
that place needed more of that. All the women agreed. It was so nice to<br/>
hear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Annette,<br/>
my son is 7.5, daughter is 21 mos. They go with me when possible, daughter <br/>
almost all the time, as she is still nursing. Son will go to a friend&#39;s house if <br/>
possible, and if they can&#39;t come or if I am riding the horse or just getting <br/>
away for a moment(Very rare, don&#39;t often feel the need)the two will stay with <br/>
my husband at home. Twice I have left dd with my mom, both times in dire <br/>
situations. <br/>
We just don&#39;t go to things that don&#39;t include our children if we can avoid <br/>
it. Lately I have been yearning to go for tea with Maureen, but it is hard to <br/>
do, and I really feel the pull towards my children when we are apart. I get to <br/>
ride my horse about once a week, but that seems to satisfy me and after an hour <br/>
I am ready to go back.<br/>
I truly like my children and like to be with them.<br/>

I have chosen to stay home when told that kids were not welcome but it<br/>

I had this an awful lot from my in laws and only after Joseph and Sierra<br/>
were born. (13 months apart) I guess they figured I didn&#39;t need &quot;time away&quot;<br/>
from Tara as she went with her dad at times too. But after Joseph and Sierra<br/>
came along, they were always asking me to Tupperwares/candle/home decor/dish<br/>
etc. parties it was sickening. Never invited me before and all of sudden I<br/>
&quot;needed to get out of the house, away from the kids, just with the girls.<br/>
Not unless I was crazy!!!!! And since all this stuff was usually at night,<br/>
it meant not only time away from my children but my husband too. I declined<br/>
every single one of them and told them why. I didn&#39;t want to be away from my<br/>
family and I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; time away from them.<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea how happy I was when they finally got it and stopped<br/>
asking.<br/>

True and I don&#39;t automatically assume it&#39;s a dislike of children.  It&#39;s<br/>
usually the personality of the person that gives them away first, then lo<br/>

be clingy and dependent on you forever if you don&#39;t force them away.&quot;  I hate <br/>
that.  I usually just explain that we really enjoy each other&#39;s company and <br/>
doing things together.  So I have parties etc and make sure to invite friends, <br/>
coworkers and all the children as well.  We have great parties.  I totally <br/>
understand if someone wants an all adult party though.  I just won&#39;t be there.  No <br/>
hard feelings or anything just not for me.<br/>

Just not being into kids and not liking them are different though.  Even my<br/>
own mother, 81, has a limited tolerance for them but she respects them and<br/>
treats them well.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who don&#39;t like kids; I had a conversation with a woman like this two<br/>
days ago.  She is my neighbor&#39;s daughter and is visiting, she is not nice to<br/>
her children and doesn&#39;t like them, it was a bummer.  I got away from her as<br/>
quick as I could without damaging my relationship as a neighbor, she wasn&#39;t<br/>
the type to listen to any encouragement to be nice.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora had gone for a short walk with her two boys during this time.  When<br/>
she came back she said that they had gone into an area that they had been<br/>
told not to go, they didn&#39;t tell her until afterwards.  They said, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
tell your mom.&quot;  She just laughed and said, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She thought it was so weird to be afraid like that and the idea of lying to<br/>
me, even if I might not like what she did, is foreign to her.  It&#39;s standard<br/>
operating procedure for these kids and who can blame them?  Of course, where<br/>
do they want to hang out while they&#39;re visiting grandma, my house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347608749">We usually go places as a family. My kids usually want to go with me <br/>
wherever I go, although Brian doesn&#39;t really *like* going to the grocery <br/>
store. He&#39;d rather go and complain than stay home without me. My dh is <br/>
the house spouse, but I&#39;m still the primary parent. I go to work all by <br/>
myself 2-3 days a week, usually before anyone else in the family is up.<br/>
<br/>
About once every week or two I&#39;ll take 2-4 hours off and run off all by <br/>
myself, leaving the kids with dh.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I got a stranger to care for my kids was when my dh was <br/>
sick and I had to work. The only time we&#39;ve had a babysitter for a <br/>
&quot;date&quot; was for the first Harry Potter movie when we took the kids to a <br/>
good friend&#39;s house to play with her kids and neices and nephews.<br/>
<br/>
For dh&#39;s medical appointments we all go. If it&#39;s for one of the kids, I <br/>
take the kid and Dad stays home with the other kid.<br/>
<br/>
In general we like to be together. I took only my 4-year-old to my work <br/>
birthday party. I don&#39;t attend work parties that don&#39;t allow kids. My <br/>
job had a great picnic last summer at a theme park and I took both kids. <br/>
There was also a lovely (I&#39;m told) Christmas party that was adults only. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t the only one who didn&#39;t go because they&#39;d rather be with their <br/>
kids.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just not being into kids and not liking them are different though.  Even<br/>
my<br/>
own mother, 81, has a limited tolerance for them but she respects them and<br/>
treats them well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Joseph was around 3 months old, I had in the stroller and was waiting<br/>
at my daughter&#39;s school to pick her up. I was talking to another mother<br/>
about Joseph and I mentioned that we wanted more soon. (little did I know<br/>
how soon!) Anyway, another mother I knew from Tara&#39;s class who has only one<br/>
son, turned around with the most shocked look on her face and said &quot;What are<br/>
you, crazy???&quot; I mean almost yelling it. She started to mumble about how one<br/>
is so much of a pain, and now that I had two, how could I possibly be in my<br/>
right mind to want more. I wasn&#39;t nearly as forceful as I would have been<br/>
now but I did let her know how I felt about what she said. The other mother<br/>
looked horrified that anyone would talk to a mom. The rude woman never spoke<br/>
to me after that. Of course in the next few months I was pregnant again so<br/>
she thought I must have really been nuts. She should see us now!!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; <br/>
Hmmmm....I&#39;ve met childless people that just aren&#39;t into kids, and we have a<br/>
good time together, just not with my son or any other kids.  That&#39;s ok, to<br/>
me.  But parents who don&#39;t like kids are just wierd to me, and there&#39;s a<br/>
fair number of them around where I live.  I don&#39;t get it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with me.<br/>
<br/>
Before Keith and I had kids, we&#39;d been together for six years, and had LOTS <br/>
of childless couples as regular hanging-out friends.   One had some babie, and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t very fun to still try to play the same games or have the same kinds <br/>
of conversations with their babies and toddlers around.   When Keith and I had <br/>
Kirby, we knew the same thing would happen.<br/>
<br/>
When I started going to La Leche League, I found new friends with kids.  I <br/>
felt disloyal to my old friends, and for a while I still tried to get together <br/>
with them.  But what I needed to do and wanted to do with little kids was NOT <br/>
sit and play a game for three or four hours, or watch a movie and drink, and <br/>
was not go to the mountains and get stoned.   <br/>
<br/>
None of that was right or good anymore, because I wasn&#39;t just Sandra, I was <br/>
Kirby&#39;s mom.<br/>
<br/>
But flashing forward to Kirby being almost grown, I no longer have the need <br/>
to socialize with just adult company.  Kirby does that now--hangs out with <br/>
people who are 30 and less, and they play games for hours and watch movies.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a phase, and that humans go through lots of natural phases.    <br/>
Humans also (in this culture for sure) tend to want to stay young, and to have <br/>
a party and say &quot;no kids&quot; seems to me to be a throwback to pretending to be <br/>
childless.    <br/>
<br/>
In the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, there was a plain term for &quot;no kids&#39;&quot; parties:  <br/>
Cocktail party.<br/>
<br/>
But the trend to dress up and have prescription chitchat for two hours died <br/>
out.  Now people wear casual clothes to parties, and and the clear difference <br/>
between the party and the everyday afternoon isn&#39;t so clear.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have an adult friend over and no kids are here.  Often it&#39;s <br/>
another mom, whose kids are elsewhere (maybe with mine! &lt;g&gt;).  It&#39;s nice, but we <br/>
invariably talk about our kids!<br/>
<br/>
Another phase of life, just as natural and good as the rest.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t get it either.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last year when I would tell family and friends that we are homeschooling invariably the mothers would comment that they just couldn&#39;t do it.  That they couldn&#39;t spend all that time with their kids.  And they would ask where did I get all the energy to do it?<br/>
<br/>
I would just shrug and tell them, you know what, I actually feel more energized at the end of the day.  I explain I&#39;m not expending energy trying to push the kids through a bunch of obligations under time constraints (getting ready for school, out the door, to afterschool activities, doing homework, off to bed etc.).  And that I really enjoy watching (or participating with) them doing things they enjoy.  That though I may be tired at the end of the day, I really feel very energized, not drained.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you can see a flicker of understanding, especially about the energy it takes to push their kids through the daily schedule.  If so, I may liken it to taking a vacation ... say something like, &quot;do you notice that everybody in your family gets along so much better when you&#39;re on vacation?&quot;  But usually they just shake their head and say &quot;wow&quot;, or some other expression of total bewilderment.

Me: My dh is convinced that homeschooling is what makes our <br/>
vacations so stress-free. The kids are used to getting along and <br/>
we just don&#39;t deal with the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a picnic for Jacob&#39;s (11) baseball team the other night. <br/>
Every parent I spoke with said something unkind about his or her <br/>
child in the presence of either that child or other children and <br/>
parents. I was dumbstruck. Here&#39;s a sample of some of their <br/>
comments (I started keeping track!)<br/>
<br/>
(about a 14 yr old dd) Daughter complains that she has been <br/>
forced to come to a brother&#39;s baseball game to the mom and <br/>
mom says, &quot;Why did I want you to come to the game again?&quot; <br/>
Then mom rolls her eyes about dd who is so unreasonable. <br/>
Goes on to explain her selfishness.<br/>
<br/>
(about 11 year old son) &quot;He&#39;s the kind that doesn&#39;t work up to his <br/>
potential in school. I had to organize a summer school program <br/>
for him to do with the baby sitter. She almost had to tie him down <br/>
to get him to do it. He&#39;s just one of those kids who doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
work and is easily distracted. But he learned. He got all As and <br/>
Bs this year. You just have to ride him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be nice to your brother and let him play. I&#39;m not getting in the <br/>
middle of your arguments again here at a picnic.&quot; (Eye roll to <br/>
sympathizing parents). &quot;These two always go at it.&quot; Little brother <br/>
runs down hill to join ball game. My son tells me later that the big <br/>
brother and three members of the team mercilessly teased little <br/>
brother calling him names and taunting him. Horrified my son.<br/>
<br/>
Then the usual assortment of comments about how I&#39;m so <br/>
heroic for staying home with our kids and how impossible it <br/>
would be in their cases, with *their* kids.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>

every function that we were invited to had a child that was nearly the same age <br/>
as our son.  For me, it made it very difficult not to be either very upset or <br/>
find myself staring in a trance like state wondering if Jackson would be doing <br/>
the same thing right now if he were here.<br/>
<br/>
We have one cousin on DH&#39;s side of the family that has a son that was born <br/>
the same day as Jack, sometimes it&#39;s a joy to hold him and play with him and <br/>
watch him, other times it&#39;s sheer torture.<br/>
<br/>
That being said it&#39;s MY problem to deal with not anyone else&#39;s who has <br/>
children that they want to bring to functions.  There were people around who were <br/>
sensitive and tried to make it easier for me at certain events but that seemed <br/>
to always just bring more inquisitiveness and attention than I could deal with.<br/>
<br/>
It is HARD for people who desperately want children or who even want a <br/>
specific child back to be around laughing playing children, SOMETIMES.  Sometimes <br/>
the kindest thing IS having someone quietly ask if you would like to hold THEIR <br/>
baby, offered out of love.<br/>
<br/>
Most times around here it&#39;s a space, money issues if children are not <br/>
included.  There might be many functions throughout the year where all family is <br/>
welcome, including extended families and all the children a place can hold.  <br/>
Certain functions they do ask no children unless they are nursing infants, but <br/>
often they provide a central location for all the kiddies to be supervised and <br/>
have a party of their own, on a much less grand scale.  My daughters often have <br/>
entertained the children at these events.<br/>
<br/>
The first time ever we were invited to a strictly no children event was only <br/>
last summer and I was somewhat surprised by it.  They said it was a fish <br/>
fry/barbque and they didn&#39;t want little children running around the grills and <br/>
kettles of oil.  I replied that my children are old enough that would not be a <br/>
concern, then they said it was a space issue.  I didn&#39;t know these people well, <br/>
they were business associates of DH but he really wanted me to go, so I did.  <br/>
My oldest daughter tagged along.  It was boring, LOTS of drinking, suspected <br/>
drug taking and we left.  So THAT&#39;S what goes on at adult only events????  I can <br/>
skip them, they are not for me!<br/>
<br/>
glena who is sure they are wonderful parties for adults that are great fun, <br/>
just not for me<br/>

possibly feel successful at the end of the day because their children are STILL <br/>
in school, they&#39;re STILL not to retirement age.  Those goals are so far away <br/>
and only little baby steps (and steps back) to show for them.<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;m with my kids in a live-in-the-moment way, my &quot;goals&quot; are met by <br/>
the hour or by the second.  I succeed over and over every day.  Some days I go <br/>
to sleep so peacefully satisfied that if the morning didn&#39;t come I would feel <br/>
successful.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I had an IM exchange with a friend from long ago, who was in LLL <br/>
and the babysitting co-op with me.   She divorced and is raising her only <br/>
child, a 13 year old boy now, alone, in a state around where Shyrley is, and so lay <br/>
THAT set of other social expectations over it.  She&#39;s not in New Mexico <br/>
anymore, but she was never from here.  She&#39;s was a city girl, and Jewish <br/>
intellectual girl, but who had neglectful and inexplicably mean parents.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s definitely not homeschooling, but she still looks to me, with my <br/>
slightly older boys whom she knew when they were little, and she asks advice.<br/>
<br/>
Last night it started about what I do when I have the urge to throttle my <br/>
boys.<br/>
<br/>
I said I talk to them, though the urge rarely comes.<br/>
<br/>
You can probably guess how the exchange went.  I asked whether the problem <br/>
involved his wanting to to do something she wouldn&#39;t let him do, and she said OF <br/>
COURSE.<br/>
<br/>
From there I knew it could only get sadder.<br/>
<br/>
The impasse involved as much of her neediness as his, but he&#39;s 13 and she&#39;s <br/>
40ish.<br/>
<br/>
Her day did not end well at all, and her Today might be going better, I hope, <br/>
but that scar will never totally disappear, from things that were done and <br/>
said between them yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
While I was exchanging instant message with her, my boys who have pretty much <br/>
the freedom of the city were:  Kirby in the library playing a game with Joey, <br/>
a homeschooler who kinda lives at our house much of the time; Marty sitting <br/>
next to me, playing a rented playstation game intently; Holly in and out of <br/>
Kirby&#39;s room (where I was on the computer) showing us things she was making and <br/>
doing and telling us stories about her long day away at three different <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
I went to sleep feeling successful.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s also another explaination.  I&#39;ve known childless couples that <br/>
CAN&#39;T <br/>
have children, have tried for years, and are so deep in the moors of <br/>
deppression that being around a happy, childfilled family is too painful for <br/>
them.  <br/>
Haven&#39;t run across people like this very often, but it does happen.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of our childless couples was that way.  They wanted children and would <br/>
have made fantastic parents, but the female partner (they&#39;re still not married, <br/>
but have been together for 30 years) got a pituitary tumor, and the meds they <br/>
gave her to keep it from growing would have messed up a fetus, and if she went <br/>
off it, in nine months it could take her out, so once when she was accidently <br/>
pregnant she had an abortion.  The choice was to have the baby and leave <br/>
Steve and the baby, if it lived, alone without her.<br/>
<br/>
So I avoid telling her any happy stories about my children.<br/>
<br/>
She was the maid of honor at my wedding.  When we started having kids was <br/>
about when she learned she couldn&#39;t.   <br/>

&lt;&lt; I was at a picnic for Jacob&#39;s (11) baseball team the other night. <br/>
<br/>
Every parent I spoke with said something unkind about his or her <br/>
<br/>
child in the presence of either that child or other children and <br/>
<br/>
parents. I was dumbstruck. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It pervades all conversation.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like the stuff Keith was reporting that the other engineers were <br/>
saying about their own teens, while Keith&#39;s stories were positive and so <br/>
either ignored or made light of (like someone saying, &quot;Yeah, we all had summer jobs <br/>
too&quot; when Keith mentioned Kirby&#39;s job, which is NOT &quot;a summer job&quot;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547726972">**And often what parents are saying to each other doesn&#39;t even involve<br/>
their individual children. It&#39;s just that &quot;MY aren&#39;t we put-upon,&quot;<br/>

Does anyone remember who is the author from Ancient Greece of a passage<br/>
complaining about teenagers that sounds very contemporary?<br/>
