<div id="ygrps-yiv-811825105">Someone wrote in saying that sometimes they are glad they aren&#39;t a<br/>
Christian because of this whole Ezzo thing and being associated with<br/>
them.  Please don&#39;t discredit Jesus or Christianity because of a couple<br/>
of humans and the faults they may or may not have.  We are all capable<br/>
of being wrong and we also all have our own opinions whether they line<br/>
up with God or not.  There are a lot of people in the world that say<br/>
they are doing things because that is what God told them to do, when in<br/>
reality they never heard from God.  They just thought they did.  I am<br/>
not saying the Ezzo&#39;s are right or wrong.  Just that they are not<br/>
Jesus.  Don&#39;t let any human represent Jesus as He truly is.  I am a<br/>
Christian and I try to represent Jesus in everything I do, BUT I cannot<br/>
ever fully represent Him because I am not perfect.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Faith, I hold my hand up here and say &#39;It was I.&#39;  But what I said was,<br/>
SOMETIMES I&#39;m glad... &#39; and nowhere did I say that I thought all Christians<br/>
were like this.  I am against the principles that Ezzo work from, as I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that we should have unquestioning obedience to any higher power, and<br/>
I am against anyone who advises methods of controlling children which do not<br/>
take their feelings and thoughts into consideration.  Now, I have to admit<br/>
that I talk the talk better than I walk the walk where loving guidance is<br/>
concerned, but I do my darndest to let my children know that they have<br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
Another point to this is that of the sort of people we are trying to raise<br/>
here.  Primitive tribes have been studied by antrhopologists and others, and<br/>
while there are many differences, some things are common to varios peoples,<br/>
with similar outcomes.  Basically the &#39;successful&#39; warrior tribes have less<br/>
physical contact with their babies than more peaceful tribes.  The children<br/>
who are raised by &#39;attachment parenting&#39; style methods tend to grow into<br/>
groups of people who are happy and comfortable around each other (allowing<br/>
for personality, of course), the children who are raised in separation mode,<br/>
babies only picked up for feeding and tied to a board for travelling, as<br/>
oppose to a sling, tend to share mistrust of others, among other personality<br/>
traits, even within their own clans.  This is not conclusive, of course, and<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely sure where I read it, even, but nevertheless, I think hard<br/>
about what kind of children I want to raise when I decide how to deal with<br/>
them.  And I don&#39;t want &#39;Stepford&#39; children, instantly obedient, bent to my<br/>
will, however easy it would make my life now, because I don&#39;t want them<br/>
dependent totally on others their whole life.<br/>

Oh, and PS...  A baby can give cues to whether he/she would appreciate<br/>
feeding round about now, LONG before they get around to crying!  Crying is a<br/>
device to tell you something is wrong.  If a baby is crying for food, then<br/>
he&#39;s had to wait too long for it!  The recommended feeding schedule has been<br/>
changed since the increase in &#39;failure-to-thrive&#39; babies from 4hrs to 2&1/2<br/>
to 3 hours.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re adaptive to your child, and have enough sense<br/>
to read when the &#39;schedule&#39; isn&#39;t working.</div>
