&gt; Blame home schooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Noah, age 7, is dead! Now the world will never know how great a man he<br/>
might have grown up to be. John, age 5, might have been in kindergarten.<br/>
He&#39;s also dead. Both boys were crowded aside as Paul, age 3 and Luke, age 2,<br/>
and infant Mary, age 6 months, arrived. All are death now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps this tragedy might serve to make us aware that all of us really<br/>
are &quot;the keepers of the children.&quot; Perhaps by doing the nosy, unpopular<br/>
thing, by raising our voices for overwrought mothers and inadequately loved<br/>
children, we can save a life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unlike the case of Andrea Yates&#39; children. Her children, of course, were<br/>
home schooled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over my span of years as a teacher, neither I nor any colleague to my<br/>
knowledge, however many degrees and state accreditation and credentials we<br/>
may have had, would have considered &quot;home schooling.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are good private schools to augment the public schools. But teach<br/>
our own? No way! We were not about to deprive our own children of the<br/>
benefits of an education &quot;in the real world.&quot;<br/>
