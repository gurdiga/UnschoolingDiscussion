 </span></blockquote>Hi Kris.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good use of this list, I think. It&#39;s where I had all my <br/>
notions challenged and I&#39;m still making gradual changes.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few principles I&#39;ve gleaned.<br/>
<br/>
1. We are the parents and we have the power. That means that <br/>
we have a bigger responsiblity to be aware of how powerless it <br/>
must feel to be a child in the home of a parent. If I&#39;m an alcoholic, <br/>
my kids partake. If my husband gets a new job, my kids have to <br/>
move and make new friends. If we buy a house with a huge yard, <br/>
there is a ton of grass to mow. Since the choices we make <br/>
directly affect the lives and well-being of our children, I&#39;ve come to <br/>
believe that it is our primary responsiblity to make sure that our <br/>
children have as many choices as possible within the already <br/>
givens they must live with until they are on their own.<br/>
<br/>
2. That means that if I talk my husband into a big house and <br/>
yard, he and I ought to be the ones who primarily take care of <br/>
it--paint it, mow the lawn, clean it up, maintain it. We now are <br/>
making decisions with that in mind. Do I want to buy this kind of <br/>
furniture if it means that I have to supervise and guard it, making <br/>
the kids miserable?<br/>
<br/>
3. Asking for help is fine. We are learning that it&#39;s wonderful to <br/>
help each other out. I used to think that I had a right to my <br/>
children&#39;s help and I spent far too much time resenting either <br/>
their half-done jobs, their procrastination or their bad attitudes <br/>
when doing the work. Once I flipped my perspective, I saw that it <br/>
was a gift from my kids to me that they would wash the dishes or <br/>
mow the lawn. Those things didn&#39;t mean as much to them. And <br/>
yet they were willing to do them.<br/>
<br/>
So I changed my phrasing and now say: &quot;Can anyone help me <br/>
get this kitchen cleaned up?&quot; If they say no, I do as much as I <br/>
can. But now, during the last six month, my kids are just helping <br/>
all the time and I can&#39;t believe it. <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, I had had a full day of schlepping kids to <br/>
sports and an evening homeschool program. I came home to a <br/>
huge amount of dishes. I heaved a sigh. I knew I had to do them. <br/>
Out of the blue while clicking away on the X box, my 15 year old <br/>
said, &quot;Hey Mom. Let me do those. Youget to bed. I can just do <br/>
them and listen to my music. I&#39;m not tired.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THAT is how it is now so often. What a difference.<br/>
<br/>
3. I offer to help often. When anyone is struggling with what they <br/>
need to do or get done, I pitch in right away.<br/>
<br/>
