<div id="ygrps-yiv-286767878">omg...how do y&#39;all do it?  i&#39;d love to be here more often, but what <br/>
looks like an average of 150 posts a day...wow!  threre&#39;s no way i <br/>
could keep up.<br/>
<br/>
maybe someday when the kids are older...??? :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210205377">www.unschooling.com, the parent site of this list, would probably be a better <br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
Go there, and then to message boards (upper left) and when you get there, go <br/>
to the box at the bottom and click &quot;new messages.&quot;  Just ask for a week&#39;s <br/>
worth of new stuff or so, of all topics, and after you know which threads you want <br/>
to keep reading, you can make a custom list of those and just check on the <br/>
days you have time!<br/>
<br/>
Any day you haven&#39;t read enough, you could go back to the beginning of new <br/>
messages and read something that&#39;s been there a while.<br/>
<br/>
Those will sit still for you, where this list tends not to.<br/>
<br/>
You could also go no-mail and read from the main yahoogroups page archives, <br/>
but that one bugs me  personally because my computer&#39;s slower.  If your <br/>
computer&#39;s fast, it shouldn&#39;t be too irritating.<br/>
<br/>
You might find a state list that&#39;s about unschooling and not so busy too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799079100">Yeah, I checked that out awhile ago. I found the message board <br/>
format was a little hard to follow. I didn&#39;t know about the custom <br/>
lists though..i&#39;ll have to check that out.<br/>
<br/>
I am nomail here...i joined a long time ago...never was on mail <br/>
because it was too busy.  yeah, i have cable internet, so it&#39;s <br/>
fast...when i had dial up, there were times i came very close to <br/>
throwing my computer out the window!! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions!!<br/>
