  I don&#39;t understand how you can post a lengthy letter describing how <br/>
offensive the word retard is to you, and how you never describe your children in an <br/>
offensive way, yet you go on to call the children in your classroom &quot;the little <br/>
retards.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had the same thoughts, but didn&#39;t say anything.   That statement was much <br/>
more offensive to me than someone saying that boys&#39; maturity is &quot;retarded&quot; in <br/>
comparison to girls&#39;.    It was like, you called the children &quot;little retards&quot; <br/>
in your own mind, but, hypotcrically, called them something else  less <br/>
deratory aloud.<br/>
