Very funny!  Maybe she should run for God, or something.  But, we&#39;d have<br/>

Who would be the AntiSandra? ( on any given day)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997870449">Well, I&#39;ve only been a member for about 2 weeks now, and didn&#39;t think that I&#39;d said anything that could be construed as attacking Sandra (don&#39;t know her, why would I?) but so far I&#39;ve had my competence as a parent questioned, and been told that my son&#39;s stressfull environment has caused all his health problems, and basically, that if I had simply parented my child in the exact same way she had parented hers, then he would be happy, healthy and wise (and by extension, that he isn&#39;t right now.) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering just what the heck is going on.  I joined this group, looking forward to people who accepted and embraced unschooling, only to find out that I don&#39;t unschool &quot;enough&quot;.  I don&#39;t know what the real point of this group is, but it sure wasn&#39;t what was described in the Yahoo group page, and I don&#39;t know if I belong here at all.<br/>
