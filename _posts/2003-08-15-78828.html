<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369281432">OK, I know I&#39;m really jumping the gun on this....but as a poor unfortunate <br/>
that is not able to attend the conference, could I get an inkling as to when <br/>

the cost of a full set (all the tapes made available) would be?  <br/>

comfortable with being videotaped, I&#39;d be definitely willing to pay some bucks for <br/>
videos of presentations. I&#39;d like to feel like I was there! (Really wish I <br/>
could be actually THERE but funds for travel, hotel, etc...aren&#39;t here.)<br/>

&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>
