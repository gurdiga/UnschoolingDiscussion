&gt; back, bruised hip etc. Very busy almost 2 yr old and almost 8 yr old. Need fun<br/>
&gt; summer ideas for preserving my sanity and theirs while staying at home as i<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t drive, right now can hardly walk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Owww, Nancy!  Sorry to hear that you are hurting.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading in one of your other posts about the problem with sunscreen<br/>
with your toddler.  Would she wear a big tee shirt?  My son never did a<br/>
nudity age, but a friend&#39;s daughter did, and she could be convinced to wear<br/>
a very large tee shirt that flapped around her knees in exchange for not<br/>
having to wear sunscreen.  No diaper or other nonsense, just shirt.  Maybe<br/>
something belonging to your older one would be appealing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Brenda. This little guffer is very anti-clothes right now. Have come <br/>
to conclusion that we will play in shade and our nice cool log house during <br/>
peak sun time, out before and after that.<br/>
thanks everyone for your kindness and humor, much uplifting and don&#39;t feel so <br/>
hopeless now. But boy is my ass black!!!!That is a lot of bruise!!!<br/>
Must decide what to do with horse later.<br/>
Nancy, waving thanks with good arm in BC<br/>
