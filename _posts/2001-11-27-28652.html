 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure this applies to your situation, but with us, we (the<br/>
parents) had to learn to remain very calm and quiet no matter what ds was<br/>
doing.  We had to hold him down physically on occassion to prevent injury<br/>
to him or others but the trick was to keep talking in a very quiet voice.<br/>
 Over time, we&#39;ve learned to recognize his symptoms sooner and we can<br/>
stop the problems before they start often.  When we can&#39;t the rule of<br/>
thumb is to stop the action - take him away from the situation if we can.<br/>
 Sometimes that means to another room or outside but then we sit him down<br/>
and let him talk it out and calm down.  But he is an extreme case with<br/>
unique circumstances.  But I think the answer is in consistency.  Always<br/>
react calmly but always react the same way.<br/>

would not worry in your place.<br/>
