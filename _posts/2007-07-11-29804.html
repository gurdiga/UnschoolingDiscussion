<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025987912">Hello lovely unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for a place for my daughter to live starting in October  <br/>
in New York City - Manhattan or Queens or Brooklyn. She will be going  <br/>
to school at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (31st and  <br/>
Madison). She&#39;d be willing to do some childcare.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, she&#39;d find a place with a family or a nice person or  <br/>
persons, who had a room or a couch or a closet. For not too too much.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist if you know if you know such a person or place.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Paula</div>
