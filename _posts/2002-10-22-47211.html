  ** Maybe I&#39;m over-simplifying things, but I think that accepting God into your heart, keeping his commandmants, and his later teachings (not the Old Testament teachings as most of those were &quot;outdated&quot; when Jesus died on the cross), and honestly repenting when you have gone against those things, is basically what it boils down to. None of the laws are really difficult to follow, most of them are simply about treating others right and taking care of yourself. Things people should be doing, no matter what their religious beliefs. I think most organized religions add way too much of their own twist to things and complicate it much more than necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903820602">Yes, most because there were some that were still to be followed, and it said so in the New Testament. Not many, but a few. <br/>
<br/>
My DH&#39;s step-father is a preacher, and compares the Bible to the internet - people can find things in both places to prove or disprove almost any view. You just have to get down to the bare-bones truth, no matter what the subject is. As for the Bible, you can&#39;t get away from the fact that it says you do have to believe in God and Jesus to be &quot;saved&quot; and go to heaven. It also commands that people should help each other, respect each other and basically treat each other right and good, not doing things like lying, stealing, and hurting others. I think all the rest is secondary to those main points. <br/>

A few days ago another poster said that she and you had discussed a <br/>
verse in the Bible that implied that good works is a prerequisite to <br/>
being saved.  Several other posters and myself are not aware of this <br/>
verse, and believe that trusting in Christ is the only prereq, as you <br/>
state above in your first sentence.<br/>

Can you send me the works verse offline?  Thanks much.<br/>

defendable...I don&#39;t go quoting verses unless I&#39;m sure, believe me.<br/>
But I don&#39;t recall a conversation in which I quoted a verse about <br/>
works.<br/>
Who did I speak with and in what context? I have no idea what you&#39;re <br/>
talking about.<br/>
And I wanted to clarify what you quoted of me....<br/>
I was saying that I saw most church doctrine as being in opposition <br/>
to Christs teachings, not my own beliefs (of course, lol)<br/>
But it sounded funny the way I wrote it.<br/>

No, I asked (to you, but to the group) to remind me which verse it was (I saw <br/>
it on one of the webpages you sent me) that said works were required.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it and thought maybe you just knew the verse, or enough to look <br/>
it up.<br/>
<br/>
The assertion made here was that ALL Protestants believed in grace, not <br/>
works.  I said no, not all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mike, I attended the Church of Christ for a while. It doesn&#39;t bring <br/>
up good memories whatsoever but I do remember that they did not <br/>
believe that trusting in Christ was the only prerequisite for <br/>
salvation. They thought that works were also important and that <br/>
someone could lose their salvation even if they still &quot;trusted in <br/>
Christ.&quot; Here&#39;s at one of the portions of the Bible that they <br/>
based that on, and there were others:<br/>
<br/>
James 2:20 - 24: You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith <br/>
without deeds is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered <br/>
righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the alter? <br/>
You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his <br/>
faith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was <br/>
fulfilled that says, &quot;Abraham believed God and it was credited to him <br/>
as righteousness,&quot; and he was called God&#39;s friend. You see that a <br/>
person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. <br/>
<br/>
Also James 2:26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith <br/>
without deeds is dead.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I&#39;m not a Christian and don&#39;t buy into this or into &quot;trusting in <br/>
Christ&quot; so you don&#39;t need to argue the point with me. I&#39;m just <br/>
pointing out verses that churches, protestant ones at that, who don&#39;t <br/>
believe in salvation through faith alone use to back up their belief.<br/>
