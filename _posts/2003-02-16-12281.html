<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202982332">Good morning,<br/>
<br/>
While I do my work ( I sew re-usable cloth pads for nursing moms) I often <br/>
listen to books on tape.  Last night I started &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.  I am <br/>
finding the principles he is talking about very interesting.  I plan to have <br/>
Trevor (14) listen too, as it tells how a couple young boys learned about <br/>
money from the one boy&#39;s Dad (who only went to school until 8th grade).  The <br/>
other Dad went to graduate school, and advised his son to go find out about <br/>
money from his friend&#39;s dad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And about being a &quot;drop out&quot; - my daughter Donika just told me while she was <br/>
with a group of students and teachers from her community college one of the <br/>
teachers said she found homeschooled students to be uncomfortable in the <br/>
social aspects of school (which I really don&#39;t think is accurate) - Donika <br/>
said that she was homeschooled, and someone in the group said &quot;oh, you are a <br/>
drop out&quot;.  Donika she felt really upset at that label.<br/>
<br/>
I explained to her there are children that are not vaccinated because of <br/>
neglect, and those that aren&#39;t because their parents made an informed choice. <br/>
 There is a big difference.  She got it, and hopefully it will give her an <br/>
example to help explain the difference to someone should she be questioned <br/>
again.<br/>

Firstly, they&#39;re badly written.  As someone who loves the written word, <br/>
it&#39;s really disturbing when a &#39;bestseller&#39; is written so poorly.<br/>
Okay, but that&#39;s really not all.<br/>
<br/>
Someone did some research on him and he&#39;s not all he&#39;s cracked up to <br/>
be.  It seems that he was talking about owning multiple properties in <br/>
Arizona (etc) and someone did a search and found him listed as owner of <br/>
only two properties, one of which he sold to buy the second <br/>
one.  Un-huh.  Yeah.<br/>
Here is some reading.<br/>

When you&#39;re done with that, read &#39;The Millionaire Next Door&#39; and &#39;The <br/>
Millionaire Mind&#39; by Thomas Stanley.  He&#39;s got the *real* goods on how it <br/>
works.<br/>

Let me know when you&#39;re rich.  You can buy me lunch!<br/>
