I&#39;m involved in another list that is all about linking unschoolers all over <br/>
the world. This comment came up when I posted a link to NHEN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The very reason I do not  support NHEN.  A parent that sends their child to <br/>
public school full time but does homework with their child in the evening <br/>
(which is mandatory in most states) is considered homeschooling by NHEN.  <br/>
That I can not agree with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this true? I never got the idea that they supported this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>
