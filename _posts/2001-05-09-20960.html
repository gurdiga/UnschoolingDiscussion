  I have had this problem, as well, and felt really torn<br/>
  between a rock and a hard place about it... on the one<br/>
  hand, even a diet moderate in complex carbs causes<br/>
  weight gain and glucose problems, but I am also having<br/>
  a lot of acidity-linked problems.  I was not aware<br/>
  that the green barley juice would alleviate the<br/>
  problem.  What brands do you use, and how much?<br/>
  We use either Just Barley or Alka Green.  For healing purposes, those without the fiber, just the juice are best.  AlkaGreen has more texture and is not as palatable.  Just Barley is a finer powder and is sweeter tasting, although it tastes like grass.  The Barley Green by AIM and other Dr. Hagiwara formulations contain maltodextrin, often derived from corn.  We have severe hypoglycemic reactions to those ones, and the paying the barley price for the percent of maltodextrin and rice powder in it did not make sense either.  Initially people tend to feel sick to their stomachs when taking it.  We started out with 1/4 teaspon and worked up to 1-1/2 teaspoon at a time.  We take it first thing in the a. m. and we get along much better now, mood-wise.  We take it 2-3 times throughout the day, depending on our foods, but the juice along is not enough as the stomach seems to need solid food too.  We try not to dilute our foods with liquids, to aid the digestive process and facilitate healing.  The impaired digestion played into our fatigue and allergies and lowered immunity as well.<br/>
<br/>
  We have great success using Food for Life&#39;s Ezekiel Bread and a bagel by another company.  They are made from the sprouted grain only, no ground flour.  This makes them high in amino acids, and the benefit to the blood sugar is noticeable - we go much longer without eating or taking the barley juice.<br/>
<br/>
  I have improved so much that I can make a blender juice out of oranges, ice, water, and flax oil. (I add barley powder for safe measure).  Keeping the fiber of the whole fruit and using flax oil help the sugars release slowly over time. I do not suffer from acidic reactions at all any more with this drink!<br/>
<br/>
  We also have seen measurable improvement by eliminating dairy and gluten for several months.  We also benefit from a diet high in raw foods.  The nutrients are intact as well as then enzymes.  Taking protein in as amino acids (as in plant foods) in better than taking in protein which then needs to be broken down into aminos and then built into protein again for the body&#39;s use.  Protein foods are rough on the kidneys over time as well.<br/>
<br/>
  I have a very close friend whose autistic daughter will enter school this year after a miraculous recovery on a similar diet and chelation and enzyme and vitamin supplementation.  I suppose you are well aware of these approaches.  <br/>
<br/>
  We have come a long way in our healing, and have a long way to go. I do not have your exact circumstances, but I relate to you in so many ways.  The life of the caregiver and the family with special dietary needs is so different than the norm.  It takes so much time and energy to research, shop, and prepare these foods.  We do not go anywhere without a supply of food just in case something happens to delay us and we need to eat.  All three girls take a full lunch box to Sunday School - some for snack, some just in case anything happens to them or me and they need the food.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, time to go eat!  Annette<br/>

  Demetria - I am definitely interested in this barley juice!<br/>
<br/>
  I have found Alka Green for $40. and Just Barley for $20. and $16.  Because the size of the container and the texture are different, they do not directly compare.  By ordering the Just Barley by the case (12 jars) I get is for $12 a bottle and just $6 shipping for the entire case.  That&#39;s almost $100 savings by the case, and with the 4 of us, it adds up!  Alka Green is also sold under another name through what may be a multilevel marketing label.  I also have a line on a distributor/manufacturer of AlkaGreen that will sell it wholesale in any quantity desired - the man said, &quot;well, if you want it in a 55 gallon drum, we can do it, or if you want it in the same size jar as the store, you can have that.&quot;  I never delved further into the pricing this way as the children balk at the taste/texture after having had the Just Barley.<br/>
<br/>
  It is even cheaper to grow at home either in dirt or hydroponically, but I&#39;m not organized enough and have enough monkeys on my back that I cannot take on the extra labor at this point, not to mention the juicing of it!<br/>
