&gt; Subject: Re: What is UNschooling ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;When was the last time anyone posted something here that was actually about<br/>
&gt; UNschooling? &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Goodness - I&#39;m relatively new but I&#39;ve posted about movies, computer games and<br/>
&gt; ensuing discussions in our family, dinosaurs crazes, playing cards with my<br/>
&gt; kids, reading pirate related books - all part of our life and unschooling. I<br/>
&gt; thought I was ON topic...Leonie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.   My point is this: How does talking about movies or computer<br/>
games, etc., pertain to unschooling, instead of simply parenting? People<br/>
whose children attend schools talk about those things, too.  So how do those<br/>
topics relate specifically to unschooling?  How are the people on this list<br/>
different from people who send their kids to school?<br/>
<br/>
A month ago, for example, when I was new here, I listened to perhaps twenty<br/>
days of back and forth from several women about one&#39;s relationship (years<br/>
before) with a rock musician named Winger. During those (slow) times, I<br/>
often wondered how that conversation related to the list even as it took so<br/>
much space. I concluded that since no one could really address unschooling<br/>
itself, that anything goes, even old boyfriends and if they were good<br/>
kissers. No one even complained that those posts interrupted any of the<br/>
other threads, and no one seemed to care that the subject was far OT.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, there have been many similar irrelevant conversations, so I<br/>
believe our list needs either to decide what kinds of things are relevant,<br/>
since there is so much dissonance, rudeness, even contempt. I have asked<br/>
that the managers try to make our purpose clear by giving examples of<br/>
....Talk about Unschooling. Is that so difficult?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah. This explains a lot of Ned&#39;s problems here, methinks.<br/>
<br/>
People on this list are different because they don&#39;t send their kids to<br/>
school. The kids on this list are different because they don&#39;t go to<br/>
school. That&#39;s all. I think that&#39;s enough - the whole dynamics of<br/>
parenting and learning change when school isn&#39;t involved. I&#39;m sure there<br/>
are parents who send their kids to school and still do some of the same<br/>
things we do (although they do them after 3:30 and on weekends) but I<br/>
think the *people* doing them become different without school in the<br/>
background.<br/>

There&#39;s just no school involved, at home or somewhere else.<br/>

<br/>
In the quantity and,perhaps, quality of our interactions...In how we see them as education and learning in addition to entertainment..In that kids don&#39;t watch movies or play games with their parents after schoolwork but in place of schoolwork, and use life as learning...Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If feel you haven&#39;t gotten this question answered, then perhaps it&#39;s because<br/>
you haven&#39;t heard the answer you&#39;re looking for. It&#39;s been answered many<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about therapy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about helping children learn.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about moving on from school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s newbies asking questions and getting answers or help in figuring out<br/>
their own answers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about letting go of schoolish ways and what we can do instead.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about talking about our days.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about talking about the personal problems we&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about talking about the legal problems we&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about pointing people to better resources where they can get help with<br/>
their too-specific-for-this-list questions.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more too. You can check the archives and add to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Like natural learning, it can&#39;t be broken down into subjects. It may cover<br/>
the full gamut of the world.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you&#39;re looking for rules so you can tell us how your rantings<br/>
about the government and schools fits in. But it suggests right there in the<br/>
intro to this list that people might find it helpful to spend a couple of<br/>
weeks getting the feel of the list. Apparently you didn&#39;t like the feel of<br/>
it, don&#39;t understand it and feel it isn&#39;t serving whatever purpose you think<br/>
it should serve.<br/>
<br/>
It was doing fabulously before you came along to try to fix what wasn&#39;t<br/>
broken.<br/>

&gt;Exactly.   My point is this: How does talking about movies or computer<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is difficult to listen when you are talking. You may want to remain <br/>
quiet for a period of time and meditate on this question. Read what <br/>
really does happen on this list until you can discern the pattern.<br/>
