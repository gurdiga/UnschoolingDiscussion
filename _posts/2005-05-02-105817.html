<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Huh.<br/>
And does implying that flamers must not be Christians lean in the  direction <br/>
of flaming non-Christians?<br/>
 <br/>
With my life&#39;s experience all in its current perspective, &quot;acting like  a <br/>
Christian&quot; isn&#39;t a very lofty goal.  <br/>
 <br/>
Within homeschooling there are still lots of people who assume all  <br/>
homeschoolers are Christian.  Usually it&#39;s been Christians who made the  wrong <br/>
assumption.  I remember a few times in earlier days (*Prodigy and  AOL communications) <br/>
someone would post a reprimand to the whole homeschooling  discussion about <br/>
how something or other wasn&#39;t what Christians should  do.  I think once someone <br/>
had used a horrible word like &quot;crap&quot; or  something (4 letter anglo saxon <br/>
word, but not the big ones, just some little  kid word), and the other time it was <br/>
about letting kids watch some particular  R rated movie.   Someone (me or <br/>
someone else) would say, &quot;Not all  homeschoolers are Christian and not all <br/>
Christians agree with you,&quot; and one  time the comeback was wonderful.   It was even <br/>
GREATER shock, and  something like &quot;Why would God call a non-Christian to <br/>
homeschool?&quot; or  something really twisted and convoluted and revealing.<br/>
 <br/>
But the belief is still out there, that homeschooling is something God  has <br/>
called Christians to do.  There are still lots of moms who wish God  had NOT <br/>
called Christians to homeschool, because they would prefer not  to.  Poor kids.<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s worth being aware that the assumption is operational  among probably <br/>
millions of people in and out of &quot;the homeschooling  community&quot; (NOT a phrase <br/>
I like or that makes much sense).<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and before anyone says this whole list is anti-Christian (which is  NOT <br/>
true) just because I tell true stories when the issue comes up, I think  I&#39;ve <br/>
clarified why I get cranky when Christians want to help (by providing  links to <br/>
lessons or whatever) or to explain Christianity to us once again  (we know; <br/>
really).  After all these years, it&#39;s coming into focus on  this:  The kinds of <br/>
Christians cited above (in the quote about flames)  discourage and disallow <br/>
analsis and questions (considering it &quot;flaming&quot; to  even ask why).  For the <br/>
sake of discipline and unquestioning &quot;faith,&quot;  they not only disallow questions <br/>
from children, but discourage real discussion  amongst themselves.  I was a <br/>
very thinking child in a very &quot;don&#39;t  question&quot; religion, and I remember the pain <br/>
and frustration that stance  causes.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s antithecal to unschooling to create a still place where  <br/>
questions aren&#39;t asked and attitudes can&#39;t be criticized because it would be  the <br/>
sins of disobedience and of lack of faith.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems people will choose to be &quot;obedient&quot; to what makes sense, if  they&#39;re <br/>
living by principles that make sense to them.  And I know people  can gain <br/>
faith in natural learning and in their children&#39;s intelligence and  goodness.  <br/>
And I also know that this paragraph thusfar would be called a  really bad word <br/>
by critical fundamentalist Christian readers and separatist  Christian <br/>
homeschoolers.  It&#39;s not a bad word outside their circles, but  inside the rhetorical <br/>
wall of &quot;Christian homeschooling&quot; it&#39;s equal to Satanic,  and it&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Humanist.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t define myself that way, but that way of thinking is condemned  by <br/>
Christians.  It&#39;s probably the main reason given to why public schools  are evil <br/>
and why God has called them all (those who feel called or who are  told they <br/>
have been called and believe it out of faith and obedience) to  hunker down <br/>
where their kids are safe from evils.<br/>
 <br/>
For people who have the tape of another talk Richard Prywtowsky and I  did at <br/>
HSC a while back, To Question or Not to Question:  That is the  Question... I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as Peaceful Parenting, but is it good  enough for me <br/>
to get some more copies of before Live and Learn in  October?   Maybe I <br/>
should just transcribe that one and put it online  somewhere.<br/>

70%?  Where in the world do they get this figure??<br/>
<br/>
However, I do believe it is possible that 70% of those buying<br/>
boxed/canned curricula are Evangelical Christians.  Ahem...<br/>

Maybe 70% of HSLDA members self-identify as EC, and they extrapolate that to apply to all homeschoolers.  Or maybe it&#39;s because they know that all &#39;real&#39; homeschoolers belong to HSLDA, so the 70% figure must be valid.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432767232">If you don&#39;t count going to the unschooling conference &lt;g&gt;, way more than 70% of the homeschoolers I&#39;ve met irl are evangelical Christians.  If you count Catholic Christians (which evangelicals usually don&#39;t count), then the number is even higher than that.  I&#39;m not talking people who homeschool and also happen to be Christian...I&#39;m talking people who homeschool BECAUSE they&#39;re Christian.  I would have guessed that 70% is low until I remember that there are more progressive parts of the country than where I live.  <br/>
<br/>
I can think of 3 Pennsylvania homeschooling families who I&#39;ve met irl who aren&#39;t Christian.  And all of those I met online before I met them in person.  (one at an unschooling board, 2 at mothering.com)<br/>
