<div id="ygrps-yiv-969684853">Hi,<br/>
  This whole concept of Sandra having victims on this list doesn&#39;t make<br/>
sense to me. If one feels victimized or attacked they have put themselves in<br/>
that role.<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t Sandra or anyone be allowed to question motives and writings,<br/>
it seems to me that she is only trying to learn. My motives for questioning<br/>
Communism are to maybe see an angle that I didn&#39;t see before, or an attempt<br/>
to understand what someone else may be thinking.<br/>
Would you rather opinions be sugar coated and sweet, so everyone is happy,<br/>
but no one learns anything?<br/>
I have noticed that some people&#39;s debate styles turn personal, defensive,<br/>
and seek pity when they no longer have a valid point of debate. All very<br/>
interesting-and I am not saying that I am above the same resorts-it is just<br/>
more obvious to me when others do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902009605">Also, a lot of times all of a sudden it turns to &quot;they say&quot; or &quot;other <br/>
people feel like I do but don&#39;t want to say anything&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
tell you who but.....&quot;.  I&#39;ve seen it time and again.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74090247">I&#39;m glad we have thoroughly discussed the Sandra issue.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else anyone wants to discuss?<br/>
<br/>
One humorous moment today was getting the Mapquest printout for our Dad -- <br/>
who now has to drive home to Florida from Colorado -- instead of flying.  The <br/>
directions were a hoot -- 10 miles this way, 20 miles this way, get on I-70 <br/>
East and drive 600++ miles.  Etc.  We figure it will take him 3 days!<br/>
