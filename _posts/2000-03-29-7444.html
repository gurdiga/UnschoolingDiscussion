<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436710682">Hello,<br/>
      I&#39;m new to the list but I thought I&#39;d share what I know. I live in New <br/>
Jersey a very homeschool friendly state. I home/unschool my 3 children and <br/>
my mother-in-law(she had my husband at 17- two of our kids are the same age- <br/>
odd...) homeschools her last three(of seven).<br/>
She is also homeschooling a 6 year old boy whose mom is a friend of hers. <br/>
She would probably say &quot;Don&#39;t do it!&quot;. She has run into all kinds of <br/>
problems from him monopolizing all her time to his mother giving her wacky <br/>
curriculum that her son is no where near ready for. Not to mention the fact <br/>
that he puts a serious crimp in her families homeschool style and flow when <br/>
he is there (three days a week).<br/>
It&#39;s a big chore and should REALLY be thought about before undertaking.<br/>
        We also have a great co-op down here. It meets only one day a week <br/>
in five week sessions. We have 25 families and need a large facility to meet <br/>
in. The kids are divided into groups from nursery on up to 7th-12th grade. <br/>
The moms volunteer class ideas and then teach them. We go from 9:30 to 11:45 <br/>
then we all have lunch. Some of the 7th-12th classes have been frog <br/>
dissection,crime science and inventions. The kids have a great time, and the <br/>
parents have fun too.We just started this in September and it&#39;s went really <br/>
well.<br/>
   Oh well just my two cents!<br/>
                  Kimberly<br/>

her own.&nbsp; Someone asked her to hs his older children, at one point they had 
a problem with the expectations of both children and parent and daycarer, but I 
think it&#39;s resolved.&nbsp; I would do it, as long as the parents were aware that 
their child would be unschooling too :-)</font></div>
