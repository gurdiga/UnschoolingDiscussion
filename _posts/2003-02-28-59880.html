<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Today is my <br/>
&gt; un-birthday. I am a leapyear baby, and even though I have been alive 31<br/>
&gt; calendar years, I get denied having a birthday today.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Happy Birthday, Ang.  Have a great party from 11p.m. to 1 a.m. or something<br/>
like that.  <br/>

My piano professor, also a leap year baby, had his 16th actual birthday when<br/>
I was in school.  We all gave him a hard time about being &quot;sweet sixteen and<br/>
never been kissed&quot;.  All the funnier because he was such an obnoxious flirt!<br/>
<br/>
So you have more more year of being 7, huh?  :)<br/>
