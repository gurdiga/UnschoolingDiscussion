&gt; June 9, 2003<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **************************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Reader,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was torn. I didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or scream. (I<br/>
&gt; guess I did both because a couple of people stopped by my<br/>
&gt; office to see if I was okay.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That was my reaction last week when I read this &quot;good news&quot;<br/>
&gt; for menopausal women who suffer from hot flashes: A new study<br/>
&gt; concludes that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor<br/>
&gt; called paroxetine (better known as Paxil) can reduce the<br/>
&gt; frequency and severity of hot flashes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is WONDERFUL news...if you happen to be on the board of<br/>
&gt; directors of GlaxoSmithKline, the makers of Paxil.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But if you&#39;re among the many women who will hear about this<br/>
&gt; and ask their doctors for a Paxil prescription, you might<br/>
&gt; eventually find yourself wishing you could trade the Paxil<br/>
&gt; for the hot flashes. The problem is, by then you might not be<br/>
&gt; able to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; 3 out of 4 doctors recommend...<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no need to spend a lot of time with the details of<br/>
&gt; this study, so here are the bare bones: Researchers randomly<br/>
&gt; selected a group of 165 menopausal women who experienced hot<br/>
&gt; flashes and who were not taking a hormone replacement<br/>
&gt; therapy. Roughly one-third of the group received 25 mg of<br/>
&gt; Paxil daily, one-third received 12.5 mg daily, and one-third<br/>
&gt; received a placebo. The frequency and severity of hot flashes<br/>
&gt; were approximately reduced (on average) 65 percent in the<br/>
&gt; first group, 62 percent in the second group, and 38 percent<br/>
&gt; in the placebo group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The researchers concluded that Paxil may be &quot;an effective and<br/>
&gt; acceptable&quot; therapy for treating hot flashes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Going just by the numbers of this study, it appears that<br/>
&gt; Paxil does relieve hot flashes. So I&#39;ll let them<br/>
&gt; have &quot;effective.&quot; But the word I have trouble with<br/>
&gt; is &quot;acceptable.&quot; Because given the wide variety of problems<br/>
&gt; that Paxil users have reported over the past decade, it would<br/>
&gt; be stretching the point to call this drug acceptable. And the<br/>
&gt; researchers are certainly well aware of the whole Paxil<br/>
&gt; package because three of the four members of the research<br/>
&gt; team are employees of GlaxoSmithKline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nice. I think it was right there I might have screamed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; A good trade off?<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because this study was conducted at Johns Hopkins Medical<br/>
&gt; School, and because it was published in the Journal of the<br/>
&gt; American Medical Association (JAMA), there&#39;s no doubt that<br/>
&gt; doctors all over the country will be intoning these<br/>
&gt; prestigious names when assuring their menopausal patients<br/>
&gt; that Paxil is an &quot;effective and acceptable&quot; treatment for<br/>
&gt; their hot flashes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Acceptable? Here are some of Paxil&#39;s side effects described<br/>
&gt; as &quot;frequent&quot;: hypertension, impaired concentration, nausea,<br/>
&gt; vomiting, emotional instability, vertigo, inflammation of the<br/>
&gt; mucus membrane, rapid heart beat, weight gain, and temporary<br/>
&gt; suspension of consciousness. And here&#39;s my favorite frequent<br/>
&gt; side effect: depression. That&#39;s right - the very thing that<br/>
&gt; Paxil is designed to relieve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s worse is that some patients report even worse side<br/>
&gt; effects when they try to discontinue their Paxil use. For<br/>
&gt; many years GlaxoSmithKline assured consumers that Paxil was<br/>
&gt; non-habit forming and easy to discontinue. Meanwhile, case<br/>
&gt; after case reported that patients coming off the drug<br/>
&gt; experienced nightmares, dizziness, burning and itching of the<br/>
&gt; skin, agitation, sweating and nausea. And for many of those<br/>
&gt; patients, the only way to treat the side effects was to begin<br/>
&gt; taking Paxil again! And then, just to make it official, last<br/>
&gt; year the FDA issued a warning that withdrawal symptoms from<br/>
&gt; Paxil may be severe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All of these things are well known about Paxil. So who (other<br/>
&gt; than GlaxoSmithKline employees) could possibly characterize<br/>
&gt; Paxil as an acceptable trade off for hot flashes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; A little spin on the side<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ABC television coverage about the JAMA study reported that<br/>
&gt; the researchers &quot;believe&quot; that Paxil is &quot;more promising&quot; than<br/>
&gt; alternative therapies such as vitamin E and black cohosh.<br/>
&gt; Their study had nothing whatsoever to do with any alternative<br/>
&gt; therapies, but ABC kindly helped them create the impression<br/>
&gt; that Paxil trumps natural methods of coping with hot flashes.<br/>
&gt; Of course, ABC didn&#39;t mention the GSK connection to the<br/>
&gt; study. They wouldn&#39;t want to offend a drug manufacturer that<br/>
&gt; buys plenty of TV advertising for its other products,<br/>
&gt; including Gaviscon, Contac, Tums, Tagament, Flonase, Zantac,<br/>
&gt; Nicorette, and Aquafresh toothpaste.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In an e-Alert I sent you last month (&quot;Spin This&quot; 5/29/03), I<br/>
&gt; told you about a number of alternative therapies that have<br/>
&gt; relieved menopause symptoms for HSI members. Contrary to what<br/>
&gt; the Johns Hopkins researchers would have ABC believe, many<br/>
&gt; women find black cohosh to be very effective in controlling<br/>
&gt; hot flashes. And if black cohosh doesn&#39;t work, there are<br/>
&gt; other safe and natural methods to try, including red clover,<br/>
&gt; wild yam progesterone cream, indium sulfate, and vitamin E.<br/>
&gt; (One member wrote to tell us that daily doses of 2000 mg of<br/>
&gt; vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E reduced her frequency of<br/>
&gt; hot flashes from 10 each day, to only one. Side effects:<br/>
&gt; none.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt; The larger picture<br/>
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that one of the primary reasons why women ultimately<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be happy using Paxil is that there&#39;s much more to<br/>
&gt; menopause symptoms than just hot flashes. In other words,<br/>
&gt; Paxil can&#39;t address menopause as a whole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some time ago I told you about a special report titled &quot;Look<br/>
&gt; and Feel Your Best,&quot; written by HSI Panelist Linda Page,<br/>
&gt; N.D., Ph.D. - a noted author and a doctor of holistic<br/>
&gt; medicine. In &quot;Look and Feel Your Best&quot; Dr. Page shows women<br/>
&gt; how to make their way through menopause naturally, without<br/>
&gt; using hormone replacement therapy. She emphasizes that<br/>
&gt; menopause is actually nature&#39;s way of protecting women from<br/>
&gt; breast and uterine cancer by rebalancing hormone production -<br/>
&gt; a process that no one should try to defeat with<br/>
&gt; pharmaceuticals. Read more at<br/>
&gt; http://www.agora-inc.com/reports/610SHORM/W610D611/home.cfm<br/>
&gt; to find out about how Dr. Page&#39;s techniques can make the<br/>
&gt; difference between just surviving menopause, and emerging<br/>
&gt; from it happier and healthier.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best of all, this report is guaranteed NOT to cause<br/>
&gt; hypertension, impaired concentration, nausea, vomiting,<br/>
&gt; emotional instability, vertigo, inflammation of the mucus<br/>
&gt; membrane, rapid heart beat, weight gain, and temporary<br/>
&gt; suspension of consciousness. But if you&#39;re feeling blue due<br/>
&gt; to menopause symptoms, it just might help lift you out of<br/>
&gt; depression.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; ..and another thing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may have heard how the Atkins diet succeeded in<br/>
&gt; two &quot;controlled&quot; trials, as reported last month in the New<br/>
&gt; England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). An HSI member named Adam<br/>
&gt; heard, and sent these comments:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;It is a shame that the results of the study shows no weight<br/>
&gt; change after a year. There are too many drop outs for the<br/>
&gt; statistics to be non biased. Would like to see your<br/>
&gt; comments.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While the results of these studies had their drawbacks, the<br/>
&gt; details are not as negative as Adam seems to think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both studies (from the University of Pennsylvania) compared<br/>
&gt; the Atkins high-protein diet to a high-carbohydrate/low-fat<br/>
&gt; diet in obese subjects. In both trials (one lasted 6 months,<br/>
&gt; and the other a year) the Atkins groups lost more weight than<br/>
&gt; the high-carb groups. In the year-long study, participants of<br/>
&gt; both groups gained back some of their initial weight loss.<br/>
&gt; The authors of the study called the differences between the<br/>
&gt; final net weight losses of the two groups &quot;statistically<br/>
&gt; insignificant.&quot; And that&#39;s true. But in the end, the Atkins<br/>
&gt; group lost more than the high-carb group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This may not sound like a resounding success, but it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; success just the same. Because until just recently very few<br/>
&gt; mainstream nutrition or dietary experts would have ever<br/>
&gt; imagined that in a one-year controlled trial a high-protein<br/>
&gt; diet could succeed over a low-fat diet. &quot;Low fat equals good<br/>
&gt; health&quot; has been the mainstream mantra for more than 20<br/>
&gt; years, but with these studies and others, that mantra is<br/>
&gt; being challenged like never before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And while it&#39;s true that there were dropouts in each of the<br/>
&gt; groups in both studies (as there are in virtually all long-<br/>
&gt; term dietary trials - especially with obese subjects), the<br/>
&gt; dropouts were not so many that the test results were<br/>
&gt; invalidated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Beyond the fact that the Atkins diet clearly bested the high-<br/>
&gt; carb diet, these equally important results stand out as well:<br/>
&gt; In the one-year trial, the Atkins group had a significantly<br/>
&gt; greater increase in HDL cholesterol, and their triglyceride<br/>
&gt; levels decreased more than in the high-carb group. Similar<br/>
&gt; results occurred in the 6-month trial, with the Atkins group<br/>
&gt; showing greater triglyceride reduction and increased insulin<br/>
&gt; sensitivity compared to the other group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we&#39;re so used to seeing wild claims on TV ads (&quot;I<br/>
&gt; lost 50 pound in two days!&quot;) that the results of a<br/>
&gt; controlled, year-long trial like this may not seem<br/>
&gt; impressive. In fact, these are very important mainstream<br/>
&gt; successes for a diet that was almost universally dismissed by<br/>
&gt; the nutritional establishment for 30 years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somewhere Dr. Atkins is smiling.<br/>
