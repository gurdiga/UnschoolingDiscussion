&lt;&lt; Try asking your pediatrician &gt;&gt;<br/>
I second this idea.  My six yo is really into anatomy and my Dr. had a book <br/>
about the ear-shaped like an ear with really good pictures, but words aimed <br/>
at a child in his office and when we asked about it, he got the drug rep to <br/>
leave him a whole box of goodies for my son. Never hurts to ask!<br/>
