<div id="ygrps-yiv-436581409">Thanks to everyone for support about school NOT being what my folks keep<br/>
telling me it is.  I just got discouraged with them, and the HSLDA<br/>
discussion was not exactly uplifting and encouraging for a stressed,<br/>
depressed parent!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I know in my heart that unschooling is so right for us, but constant<br/>
negative feedback does get to me after awhile.  I can&#39;t get them to even<br/>
read about or consider the possibilities of unschooling, so I&#39;m not getting<br/>
very far on that end.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody else regularly deal with unsupportive family members?  Any<br/>
suggestions?  (My solutions this week included deafness -- it&#39;s amazing the<br/>
things I just didn&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; &lt;g&gt; and saying &quot;mmmm&quot; a lot -- the ultimate<br/>
non-commital answer.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks!<br/>
brenda<br/>
who&#39;s very happy to be back with hubby and not with parents!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think it might be VERY useful for you to modify Carol Narigon&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; write-up and print it on some lovely paper, making <br/>
it look very official (if not officious &lt;g&gt;) and give that to your family <br/>
members.<br/>
