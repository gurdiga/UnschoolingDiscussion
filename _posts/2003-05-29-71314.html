<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392687082">Thank you for all of the answers to my question on &quot;handedness&quot;.  I told Lindsay that I thought the teacher was trying to pigeon hole Kai but that I would ask you all.<br/>
<br/>
She had hoped to begin home schooling him this summer (yes, she gets constant encouragement from me to abandon &quot;schooling&quot; altogether) but her husband opens a new business this month and she will be needed to get it off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m going to have to help her tell the &quot;teach&quot; to back off, I don&#39;t have much hope of her respecting this request.   Grrrr, that infuriating, &quot;I AM the professional educator.&quot; smugness.  This is only PRE-school for cripes sake!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy for Jonathan that he is free of even the tiniest message about &quot;handedness&quot; right now, free to develop both hands to his desired proficiency.<br/>
