Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>

<h4>Andrea</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158387393">Both of my older boys read by age five, simply by being read to and having <br/>
access to computer games and things like magnetic letters on the fridge. My <br/>
3.5-y.o. now recognizes most letters and likes to play Boggle junior. Our <br/>
oldest, William,age 10, likes to read fiction and non-fiction both but our <br/>
7-y.o. (Eric) does not much like to read on his own. He likes for me to <br/>
read to him. He can read anything, though, and likes word games.<br/>
<br/>
A funny story about when Eric learned to read: When he learned, it was like <br/>
something clicked, and he could suddenly read everything (the same as it <br/>
was for me). There is a coffee and donut chain in Canada called Tim <br/>
Horton&#39;s with outlets everywhere, and we go there once in a while. As soon <br/>
as Eric learned to read he was indignant about the name of the store. &quot;That <br/>
sign is wrong! It&#39;s not Tim Horton&#39;s, it&#39;s supposed to be Tim Porton&#39;s!&quot; If <br/>
you say it out loud you can hear the almost-p sound you make going from the <br/>
m to the H.<br/>

to read, I just remember a simple book that I read over and over. It was like <br/>
I had it memorized, but I could identify the words. It went &quot;oh no, not that, <br/>
you crazy cat&quot;. When I first started unschooling, I had underlying anxiety <br/>
about how to teach my younger children to read, because my 10yo was taught at <br/>
school and I didn&#39;t have to worry about it. I know differently now. I can now <br/>
look back at when she was decoding books at home, and it had nothing to do <br/>
with what she was doing at school. I am not so worried with my younger <br/>
children learning to read now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718779882">That is exactly how my oldest learned to read. I keep saying it was like<br/>
magic because it seemed that way to me.  I answered her questions, she read<br/>
a little bit aloud to me, and then it pretty much clicked and she could read<br/>
just about anything.  It was so cool!  <br/>
 <br/>
That was one of the factors in me deciding to homeschool her.  How can you<br/>
send a kid who can read just about anything into a K class where they don&#39;t<br/>
introduce the letters until January.  I didn&#39;t read until I went to school,<br/>
but I think I learned the same way.  My only memories of Kindergarten are of<br/>
sitting in a circle for reading time, waiting for it to be my turn to read<br/>
aloud.  I would read the three words on the page and then it would take an<br/>
eternity to be my turn again, because many of the kids weren&#39;t ready to<br/>
learn to read and they struggled terribly with it.  They don&#39;t have kids<br/>
read in Kindergarten anymore because they figured that out.  But what about<br/>
the kids who learned to read early and were ready for it?  What do they do<br/>
while the other kids learn their letter sounds?  They sit there and listen<br/>
or interrupt the class by finding something more interesting to do.  That<br/>
was me, always horsing around because school came easy for me and I had to<br/>
entertain myself.  :0)<br/>
 <br/>
Course, now I am homeschooling for entirely different reasons...love of<br/>
learning, being self-directed, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131627119">I was reading at the age of three, and my grandparents &quot;taught&quot; me.<br/>
Neither of them had higher than 2nd grade schooling and they didn&#39;t own<br/>
any books, but they&#39;d sit with me in the kitchen and tell stories.  My<br/>
grandfather had paper and pencil and he&#39;d write down the key words to<br/>
the stories, like if he was talking about himself and his sister when<br/>
they were kids, he&#39;d write &quot;Grandpa (Benjamin) and Aunt Mary&quot;.  My first<br/>
day of kindergarten they told us to write everything we could, if we<br/>
knew the alphabet or any words.  I wrote the alphabet and &quot;I love you&quot;<br/>
and my name and address and I was still writing because I hadn&#39;t written<br/>
all I knew, but the teacher grabbed it from me and said, &quot;We don&#39;t need<br/>
all that.&quot;  I remember to this day how insulted I felt.  Another vivid<br/>
kindergarten memory I have is when I was turning in a paper and I laid<br/>
it on the teacher&#39;s desk on top of a paper where a boy named Sean had<br/>
written his name with the letter &quot;S&quot; written backwards.  I asked the<br/>
teacher why his letter &quot;S&quot; was facing that way and she told me it was<br/>
because he was &quot;an idiot&quot;.  Even at the age of 5, I was shocked by her<br/>
harshness and I didn&#39;t see how it made him an idiot.<br/>

 <br/>
I know.  If *I* remember her calling him an idiot, I *know* he remembers<br/>
what she thought of him.  And she probably told his first grade teacher,<br/>
who probably told his second grade teacher . <br/>
 <br/>
I think the masters degree in education should include classes in<br/>
Compassion 101 and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies.  <br/>
 <br/>
A different boy I went to school with killed himself when we were 15.<br/>
He was ostracized from kindergarten *by the teachers* because he was too<br/>
smart.  They&#39;d be trying to teach 1+1=2 and he&#39;d be talking about<br/>
something he&#39;d just read in a plane geometry book, so they&#39;d make fun of<br/>
him.  In front of the class.  Every teacher we had all the through<br/>
school made fun of him in front of the class and made him sit by<br/>
himself.  He was a prime target for bullies, and no teacher ever stood<br/>
up for him.  When he killed himself, there wasn&#39;t anyone, teacher or<br/>
student, who asked &quot;why?&quot;  We all knew.  We all saw what was being done<br/>
to him all those years, yet the adults never imagined where it would<br/>
lead.  *What* they thought they were accomplishing, I don&#39;t know, but I<br/>
know they didn&#39;t think he&#39;d kill himself.  He was a prime candidate for<br/>
unschooling . his life and death have affected me deeply and he&#39;s the<br/>
reason I started looking into homeschooling before I even had kids.  But<br/>
I can&#39;t even thank him for the things he taught me, and he can never do<br/>
all the great things he was going to do in this world.  He was the only<br/>
person I&#39;ve ever known who was truly &quot;talented and gifted&quot;.  School<br/>
should have loved him and he should have flourished there.<br/>

about burst when she picked up a book last week and (after discussing the <br/>
