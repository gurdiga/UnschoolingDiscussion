 </span></blockquote>Lynda, you and I must not be reading the same list.  :)  The math response<br/>
that follows your question sure doesn&#39;t sound like a school-at-home answer.<br/>
<br/>
I do think we get an awful lot of questions, maybe even mostly newbie<br/>
questions that begin with a schoolish premise. Some people take years to<br/>
move through all their unstated assumptions about learning and school.  We<br/>
are all at very different places in our own journey, so therefore you&#39;re not<br/>
going to hear a party line answer, not<br/>
even an unschooling party line answer to most questions.<br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact that trying to define unschooling will bring out a whole<br/>
host of folks though. &lt;VBG&gt;  We&#39;re the most vocal  of the *don&#39;t define me<br/>
for me * groups that I have ever run across.<br/>
<br/>
There is one thing that we are not doing on this list, we are not hearing<br/>
from our long-long term unschoolers.  And we aren&#39;t doing much talking about<br/>
what affect our unschooling kids are having out there in the world.. that is<br/>
if we can tell what might be going on. I suspect that might be because life<br/>
is so very busy and hectic, at least it is for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have some friends here who want to start a group called LLL -The Next<br/>
Generation. Our kids are way past the nursing/toddler age, but we find we<br/>
still need support as our parenting is oh so very different. And not just<br/>
different in the educational arena either.<br/>
<br/>
So Lynda, what do you have on your mind? Unschooling wise that is?<br/>

Lynda,<br/>
   I believe that unschooling is learning about what your child is interested <br/>
in, when your child is interested in it.  But.... unschooling means different <br/>
things to everyone, that is the beauty of it, so how can one definition <br/>
really cover it?  I have been chastised at a local support group because they <br/>
felt that *unschooling* meant that we could not ever use any books or <br/>
anything even remotely *schoolish*!  Seriously!  The point of <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling to me is that as a parent I believe there is a <br/>
better more individualized way to teach my own children ,(there are also many <br/>
other reasons why I chose to keep my children home).  My point is, how can <br/>
one definition fit so many different ways of life??  <br/>

     I haven&#39;t been around much lately but I had a little while tonight and <br/>
saw your post.  When I was reading from the list a lot more in Nov and Dec, I <br/>
thought this list had a predominantly unschooling approach.  I think of <br/>
unschooling as the child led learning that is written about in The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook and John Holt&#39;s books, etc.  I think many people come to <br/>
this approach over time as their homeschooling evolves.  We started off years <br/>
ago as a school at home approach and gradually lightened up more and more.  <br/>
Now I strongly believe in the unschooling approach.  I have seen that other <br/>
approaches lead to threats, blackmail, and various forms of unhealthy <br/>
coersion to &quot;make&quot; the child do or learn what we have decided he must at a <br/>
given time.  I wish I had realized all of this a lot sooner but I am glad <br/>
that I did at least figure it out while all my kids are still kids.<br/>
     While we were in Minnesota, I listened to a friend of mine trying to <br/>
make her 7 year old son do a stack of worksheets he&#39;d brought home over <br/>
Christmas vacation.  He had spent 7 hours rewriting some sentences to correct <br/>
the mistakes and she was really frustrated with him.  She told him if he <br/>
didn&#39;t get it done soon, he would be missing the Christmas party at his <br/>
grandparents&#39; that his siblings and cousins would be at (a special one for <br/>
just the kids).  I felt so sorry for him and yet I realized that those kinds <br/>
of threats are common methods used to make kids do school work.  Worst of <br/>
all, I remembered using similar tactics when my oldest was little and in <br/>
public school.  I thought I HAD to make him do the work and I didn&#39;t know <br/>
what else to do when he wouldn&#39;t.  <br/>
     I believe those kinds of threats are inherrent in forced learning.  That <br/>
is why I have become such a strong believer in unschooling.  Anyway, just <br/>
some thoughts brought on by your question...<br/>
<br/>
