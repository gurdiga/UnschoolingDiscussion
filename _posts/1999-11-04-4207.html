<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have this image of myself too.  I would ask to be in girl scouts and found <br/>
out shortly after joining that this was not me at all (I was a tomboy) and <br/>
wanted out.  Well, the made me go for awhile and I was finally able to quit.  <br/>
I wanted a horse so they got me a horse and had me do 4-H.    I stuck with <br/>
4-h because that was the only way I knew to do my favorite part, pole bending <br/>
and barrels.  It amazes me sometimes that they didn&#39;t put me where I most <br/>
belonged like rodeo.  Of course I eventually quit because I grew bored and <br/>
the horse was basically a runaway and gave me fits.  Again I was the quiter, <br/>
capricious, never finished anything.  Then I decided on the swim team.  No <br/>
way, uh-uh, I would only quit again so they were going to waste their time <br/>
taking me.  So I gave up on it until I got my drivers license and then <br/>
joined.  I stuck with it until I was too old at 18 yrs.  They never knew I&#39;d <br/>
like it so much... blah blah blah.  I always said that I would pay attention <br/>
to the wants of my kids.<br/>
  So here I am with 3 kids of my own (only one of them is homeschooling right <br/>
now).  My kids dabble in this and that.  Recently it was flag football for <br/>
the one I am homeschooling.  It turns out he hates it.  He was in tears half <br/>
the practices and every game.  His dad, my ex, made light of it and saying <br/>
basically he should tough it out.  Other people were telling me he should at <br/>
least finish out the season.  I was torn for a bit but I stopped worrying <br/>
about making the practices on time or taking him home early.  Then I just <br/>
asked him one day, do you want to quit?  He said yes so we haven&#39;t gone back. <br/>
 It was torture for him and I hated to see him hurt (emotionally, there were <br/>
some mean kids on that team and an oblivious coach).  My youngest at 6 tried <br/>
flag football two practices and got out.  He knew it was not for him.  My <br/>
older son only wanted to stick it out I think because it was his dad&#39;s <br/>
favorite playing sport.  <br/>
  Kids have feelings too.  I guess because as an adult I&#39;ve followed my heart <br/>
and I want that for my kids as they grow up.  I still try a little of <br/>
everything.  I get into things enough to learn the basics and I move on.  I&#39;m <br/>
happy this way.  Maybe my kids will be happy that way too.  <br/>
