<div id="ygrps-yiv-111968596">Attention, teenage explorers, pioneers, and globetrotters!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After a six-week journey through Argentina this fall, Unschool Adventures is pleased to <br/>
announce our next adventure on the Hawaiian island of Maui for the entire month of April, <br/>
2009!<br/>
<br/>
Argentina was a thrilling adventure for our nine unschooled teen students (ages 15-19), <br/>
and we are excited to continue the Unschool Adventures approach to unbridled learning <br/>
and exploration.  Grab your swimsuit and a pair of flip flops and join Not Back To School <br/>
Camp advisors, Blake Boles and Abbi Miller, for a healthful and challenging experience of a <br/>
lifetime. The theme of this trip is &quot;Health is Wealth&quot;: learning how to care for your body. <br/>
Students will learn to plan and prepare nutritious meals, keep their bodies active and <br/>
healthy, and experience a full month of overall mind-body wellness. Other activities <br/>
include biking, hiking, daily yoga on the beach, and possibly surfing & windsurfing <br/>
lessons. You&#39;ll also get the chance to experience authentic Hawaiian culture, complete the <br/>
world&#39;s longest down-hill bike ride (down a volcano!), devour fresh coconuts and papayas, <br/>
and discover lush tropical beaches!  The trip will consist of 10-12 students, ages 15-19 <br/>
(flexible), and two trip leaders. The group will stay in a rented house near the town of Paia <br/>
for the duration of the course.<br/>
<br/>
The total program fee is $3,999, which includes lodging, activities, transportation in Maui, <br/>
and all-you-can-eat delicious & healthful food.  Students are responsible for covering <br/>
personal incidentals, traveler&#39;s insurance, and roundtrip airfare to Maui.<br/>
<br/>

to send your application!<br/>

Thanks, and we hope to see you on sunny Maui!<br/>
