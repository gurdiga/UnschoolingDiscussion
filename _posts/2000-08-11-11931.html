<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073513227"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, we told the kidlets NO hamsters.  They don&#39;t live very long and most<br/>
&gt; kids get tired of them real quick as there isn&#39;t much you can do &quot;with&quot;<br/>
&gt; them.  My little sister had about a dozen &quot;Rosie&#39;s&quot; when she was little and<br/>
&gt; each time one died my mother would sneak in a new one.  I&#39;m not sure who<br/>
&gt; was fooling who &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of the man who sees his dog bring in the neighbour bunny into<br/>
his yard, dead. He knows he has a few hours before the neighbour lady gets home<br/>
so he washes the fur, dries it with a hair dryer, goes to the neighbour yard,<br/>
puts the bunny back in the cage and props it up to look alive.The lady&#39;s<br/>
arrival at home is soon followed by a loud scream.<br/>
Going out in the yard, he asks what was the matter?<br/>
&quot;Well, the bunny died yesterday and I buried it, and now I find it back in its<br/>
cage again!&quot;<br/>
