 </span></blockquote>He said he is, but he&#39;s scaref of the normal academy.  Once they over heard <br/>
through the all some stuff involving large numbers of difficult push-up combos.<br/>
<br/>
Two of the officers told me in a real way (not just the offhanded reminder <br/>
tone) that when he&#39;s fifteen I should get him into their next program up which <br/>
is twice a week with ride-alongs and helping with traffic accident scenes <br/>
sometimes.  He&#39;s interested.  It&#39;s six months away.  <br/>
<br/>
He really liked the crime scene stuff a lot.  They set up a scenario like a <br/>
test for groups of kids to see what they could discover.  Sounded really cool.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have really enjoyed reading this stuff about Marty and the police cadet week. <br/>
How exciting for him. Sandra, did they meet any of the dogs on the force? A <br/>
friend of mine trained a Belgian Malinois in Schutzhund, her name was Hella. <br/>
She was a cool dog, and Janet did a great job with her, but she was sooo much <br/>
dog, she ended up selling her to the Albequerque(sp?) police. Just wondered if <br/>
she was still around.Very off topic.<br/>

that was it.  He said &quot;no,&quot; about every breed I guessed.  He said there were <br/>
three attack dogs that day, and they talked a lot about points on ratings of <br/>
tests of some sort, and the special quirks of individual dogs.   Another day there <br/>
were drug sniffing dogs (and I don&#39;t know how many that day).  <br/>
