<div id="ygrps-yiv-506464438">While I have been following the food discussion I wanted to mention <br/>
some things.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure programmes such as &quot;You are what you eat&quot; (do you have <br/>
in US?) has helped. It is about educating people to ditch the <br/>
unhealthy junk food (according to Gillian McKeith) and eat lots of <br/>
fruit, veggies, raw and wholegrains. I know there are some kids who <br/>
have become obsessed with only eating the right kind of food <br/>
regardless of whether that is they wanted. For instance eating a <br/>
whole bunch of grapes when they&#39;d rather have some chips.<br/>
I have struggled with food issues myself. I was vegan for 10 years <br/>
and was bringing my kids up as strict vegans. Yes I went to parties, <br/>
told them the cake wasn&#39;t vegan and gave them a vegan one. If I could <br/>
go back I would so change that. We are more relaxed now and all are <br/>
vegetarian. I still find it hard as my kids gravitate towards, pizza, <br/>
string cheese, oven fries etc. I eat home-cooked stuff but they never <br/>
want to try it. Maybe it will improve when they get older? It is hard <br/>
for me to let go. I keep thinking of the eat 5 fruit and veg a day to <br/>
avoid cancer campaign and worry for my kids adult health. I try and <br/>
not show it to them though and serve them the food they ask for. <br/>
Food, can be a tricky issue for many people.<br/>
