Dear Friends, <br/>
<br/>
Yahoo is now using something called &quot;Web Beacons&quot; to track Yahoo <br/>
Group users around the net and see what you&#39;re doing and where you <br/>
are going - similar to cookies. Take a look at their updated privacy <br/>
statement: <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html">http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About half-way down the page, in the section &quot;Outside the Yahoo! <br/>
Network&quot;, you&#39;ll see a little &quot;click here&quot; link that will let <br/>
you &quot;opt-out&quot; of their new method of snooping. I strongly recommend <br/>
that you do this. <br/>
<br/>
Click below to opt out<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pclick.yahoo.com/p?optout">http://pclick.yahoo.com/p?optout</a><br/>
<br/>
Once you have clicked that link, you are opted out. Notice <br/>
the &quot;Success&quot; message the top the next page. <br/>
<br/>
Do it with each one of your web browsers.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful because on that page there is a &quot;Cancel Opt-out&quot; button <br/>
that, if clicked, will *undo* the opt-out. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to forward this to other groups.<br/>

about this because it is not in the interest of Yahoo not to be able to <br/>
harvest/mine information from users that they could use in their <br/>
business.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, the pressure and responsibility! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d go check it out. And opt out of anything that looked suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Places of business have to earn my trust first. Yahoo has earned negative<br/>
trust by placing ads everywhere they can, regardless of their annoyance<br/>
factor. Their first priority making money, not making people happy.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all getting the lists for free anyway and not (apparently) giving<br/>
Yahoo anything in return. But what we are actually giving them in return for<br/>
what they give us is our presence (and information) for them to make money<br/>
off of.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. We&#39;re always paying for what we get<br/>
somehow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not true. Have you heard of data mining and marketing <br/>
demographics?<br/>
<br/>
It is not a secret Yahoo! is a force to reckon with when it comes to <br/>
personalized marketing, right up there with Amazon. At least Amazon <br/>
let&#39;s you know they&#39;re harvesting information with your every move <br/>
through their site. It&#39;s part of their customer service. Yahoo! has <br/>
been very silent about the same thing for years. Technically they&#39;re <br/>
supposed to strip your personalized information from your identity. <br/>
Technically. It does not mean they&#39;re not keeping the information out <br/>
of databases. They&#39;re just parsing it out so that they don&#39;t get in <br/>
trouble with the current laws. Are they lobbying to change the laws? <br/>
You betcha. To companies like Yahoo! privacy laws are an obstacle to <br/>
making not millions but billions in advertising.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why Google is investing heavily in creating groups, BBSs and <br/>
blogs.<br/>

Nobody pays to be on a list, directly.  That&#39;s why &quot;apparently&quot; was there.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be on these lists.<br/>
<br/>
If people have to run their own servers instead of just using space on other <br/>
people&#39;s, they&#39;ll end up paying money for the privilege one way or another.  <br/>
Or they&#39;ll use university space, which still ends up costing money in state <br/>
taxes or however.<br/>
<br/>
I pay money so that people don&#39;t have to see ads on my webpages.  For free, I <br/>
could have pages and yahoo would put banners on them.<br/>
<br/>
We get broadcast TV, which just means putting the TV in and any $20 antenna <br/>
and getting eight or nine channels free where I live.    The commercials <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be too complained about by people who are getting free broadcast.   The <br/>
promise of cable TV was to have been, originally, that people would subscribe <br/>
and shows would be shown without commercial breaks.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem to have been the eventual outcome.<br/>
<br/>
But as sponsored media is a reality (magazines, newspapers, radio, TV), let&#39;s <br/>
not spend a bunch of time discussing or complaining about it, please.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t help people unschool.<br/>
