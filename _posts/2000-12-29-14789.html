<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139261891">well i have been lurking here for awhile..lol. i am starting to feel <br/>
like some sort of criminal..:-) i dont have alot to offer the world <br/>
right at this point in my life. i am 13 weeks pregnant with baby #4 <br/>
and simply want to sleep until i give birth..lol!!<br/>
i do however homeschool my kids for the reason of i love them very <br/>
much and i want them to grow into responsible adults who care about <br/>
the people and things around them. and i dont believe they get any of <br/>
that at any public school. i homeschool them because the schools are <br/>
to into labeling kids now days and i dont want my kids hurt by the <br/>
labels put onto them by someone who gets paid 40,000$ a year to <br/>
*teach* them. no amount of money is worth my childs self esteem!!!<br/>
 besides recycling our hosuehold garbage, i dont garden even though <br/>
i&#39;d love to, i find myself just so busy trying to keep up with daily <br/>
activities inside we dont manage to get out alot. we do go for nature <br/>
walks on the hiking trails located on the back side of the base here <br/>
and we enjoy looking for bird nests and wondering what they lil baby <br/>
birds eat, look like, think. etc.....<br/>
i love conviences...esp..right now, so we spend way to much money on <br/>
eating out since i hate cooking right now. but i mean i lvoe my <br/>
microwave, i love being able to buy things premade/prepackaged.<br/>
i gues you could say i am one of the folks you guys dread:-)<br/>
but the balance between us is what makes the world turn.<br/>
just thought i&#39;d add my opinion here.<br/>
blessings to all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I&#39;m concerned, that&#39;s the most important thing anyone can do for<br/>
the planet -- love their kids wholeheartedly and raise them to care about<br/>
other people and about the world around them. It&#39;s sad, but true, that huge<br/>
numbers of parents out there just do not have this as their highest<br/>
priority. For many parents, it&#39;s not even on their list of priorities. So<br/>
you have nothing to apologise for!<br/>
