<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783413699">Nation of Survivors<br/>
<br/>
In the bright September morning without warning to us all <br/>
A few thousand lives were shattered and we watched two buildings fall <br/>
And a billion souls felt empty, and the flags at half-mast fly <br/>
In the memory of the innocent which didn&#39;t have to die <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve lost brothers, sisters, cousins. We&#39;ve lost family and friends <br/>
But we&#39;ve made the choice not to forget their lives and tragic ends <br/>
Though we&#39;ve had our share of troubles we have put them all aside <br/>
As a nation grieves we find ourselves defending them with pride <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a nation of survivors, with one heart we share a tear <br/>
But we live to serve the memory, not giving in to fear. <br/>
Though they try to take security with the things they&#39;ve done and said <br/>
All their acts of inhumanity bring unity instead. <br/>
So we stand here as a family. One heart, one soul, one voice. <br/>
We are challenged by this moment, and united here by choice.<br/>

The above poem was written by one of the teens on the teen list I<br/>
moderate.  I think it is good enough to pass on so here it is.  (BTW -<br/>
She said sign it anonymous.)<br/>
