====Do you try and plan a few activities for the week or month?===<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not much of a planner, honestly. If others are involved, we <br/>
plan--4-H, park days, LLL, stuff like that. Those are on the schedule. <br/>
But most of our life tends to be much more organic than that. I don&#39;t <br/>
like to feel over-scheduled; I don&#39;t want to feel obligated to do <br/>
something if our day just doesn&#39;t match up. <br/>
**********<br/>
OMG&lt; We&#39;ll never get to meet!! I&#39;m like that.<br/>
***********<br/>
By the same token, if we all <br/>
wake up and feel like going somewhere, I want to be able to go with that <br/>
spontaneous energy. I don&#39;t plan to grocery shop or clean or anything on <br/>
any particular day. That kind of scheduling just brings out the rebel in <br/>
me. *g*<br/>
*******<br/>
Maybe there is hope. let&#39;s just hook up spontaneously one day!! email me in <br/>
the am and if we aren&#39;t going to a &#39;planned by someone else event&#39; we&#39;ll meet <br/>
you!!<br/>

<br/>
*lol*  See, that&#39;s what I miss most about my friend in Albuquerque. We <br/>
could call each other up and say, &quot;Hey, are you guys up for the park/ <br/>
museum/ whatever?&quot; And we&#39;d meet. It was great. *sigh* No one like that <br/>
here. Folks are way too scheduled for that kind of spontaneous outing. <br/>
They either have something to do, or they&#39;ve had so many somethings to <br/>
do that they just want to stay home.<br/>
