<br>something wonderful is about to happen. Your brain is preparing to do

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405955404">A few years ago a teenager in our support group, who had not long been<br/>
taken out of school, complained of boredom. After thinking about it, and<br/>
about the times I, or my children, were bored, I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
Boredom<br/>
is the moment between the striking of the match<br/>
and the flare as the spark catches.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boredom<br/>
is the pause between two breaths;<br/>
the darkness just before the flick of the switch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boredom<br/>
Is the stillness just before the dawn chorus<br/>
And the grey dusk before the moon rises.<br/>
<br/>
Boredom<br/>
Is the dark, dank, musty tunnel<br/>
Urging the spirit on towards the light.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do not berate or despise the hours of<br/>
boredom:<br/>
Embrace them as welcome rest<br/>
Before the next dance of life.<br/>

understand why I get so bored with everything maybe I&#39;ll never know. But it <br/>
is painful, it&#39;s not a minor irritation for everyone, for me and maybe some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364205865">Wotcha all, finally back on the internet after two weeks of computer <br/>
repairs, DSL problems etc etc. I&#39;m now using dial up and hve no <br/>
personal email though :-(<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about boredom. My kids, usually the youngest, often <br/>
say they are bored. This is despite books, play station, PC etc etc. <br/>
It is true that we don&#39;t see many people - actually we only know 1 <br/>
unschooler in this area - so I know my kids are lonely and miss their <br/>
English friends but when I was there age we lived on a farm with no-<br/>
one for miles so we made our own amusement. They don&#39;t want to play <br/>
outside cos its too hot and humid and there are ticks.<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to feel a bit depressed at the thought of the long <br/>
summer stretching ahead, stcuk inside with three unmotivated kids :-(<br/>
I&#39;ve asked them if they want to sign up for any of those *camp* <br/>
things but unless I go with them they don&#39;t want too. (and to be <br/>
honest I find them very schooly and artificial and full of kids <br/>
dumped there by their parents who don&#39;t want them around everyday)<br/>
<br/>
The eldest is bored cos she only has 1 friend. 11 year old <br/>
homeschooling girls who aren&#39;t Christian are a bit thin on the <br/>
ground. The youngest doesn&#39;t have any friends his age now in this <br/>
area. He had one but the mother disapproved of his long hair and <br/>
unschooling - I think her son started to ask why he had to do <br/>
workbooks and have his hair short ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Do other people go through this too? What do you do? Take Xanax and <br/>
drink?<br/>
<br/>
Roll on Autumn!!<br/>

I&#39;d recommend an unschooling conference, but I see only one child signed up! &lt;<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve tried all this.<br/>
<br/>
A trampoline in the back yard with the water sprinkler under it.  Even if<br/>
your kids don&#39;t like it after you have that drink and a Xanax YOU will<br/>
have a great time out there. &lt;g&gt;  Just remember to pee first and wear a<br/>
bra.   ( Wal-mart has trampolines for $129.00) (bra&#39;s for less)<br/>
<br/>
One of those twelve foot back yard pools.  Their thirty inches deep or<br/>
so, and big enough to frolic in or float on with a floatie mat. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you live near one, some or all of these things and can get out a<br/>
couple times a week. <br/>
<br/>
A climbing wall at a sporting goods shop. (air conditioning)<br/>
Bumper cars. <br/>
A pool or water park. <br/>
A big mall with a skating rink. (air conditioning AND a food court)<br/>
Video Arcade.<br/>
Paint Ball!<br/>
<br/>
Make Ice cream the old fashioned way with ice and rock salt.<br/>
Get in the car and see how many ice cream places you can find and how<br/>
many different flavors you can try.<br/>
Go to a lake and rent a boat. <br/>
Go to the beach.<br/>
Tour a cave.  (nice and cool)<br/>
Buy a tent and some tick spray, check the weather map for the coolest<br/>
place in your state, go camp there. <br/>
Go see a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Other things we do, but it might be too hot where you live:<br/>
Go hiking<br/>
Visit a ghost town.<br/>
Gold panning.<br/>
Rock climbing.<br/>
Go on a picnic.<br/>
Fishing. (I don&#39;t fish but my husband does)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Shyrley.  Nobody should have a boring summer.<br/>
Come to Montana for a visit.   It&#39;s usually cool and you can try out our<br/>
trampoline before getting your own.<br/>
(bring your own Xanax)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The following is a list of things we do when we get bored. It is not <br/>
exhaustive nor is it full proof. However, so many of these work that I <br/>
thought I&#39;d throw them out here. (We began years ago by making a list <br/>
that we posted to the refrigerator that could be referenced when <br/>
someone got bored. Just having this list posted saved a lot of <br/>
cloudy-eyed wandering through the house...) This list applies to all <br/>
the ages of our kids ranging between 7-17. We have five children.<br/>
<br/>
1. Find a sibling and play a board game (list of games we own)<br/>
2. Jump on the trampoline<br/>
3. Kick the soccer ball<br/>
4. Make a tent out of sheets in the living room and eat snacks under it<br/>
5. Call a friend on the phone to chat or to come play<br/>
6. Dress up and pretend<br/>
7. Play drama games (we have a book of these and we are theater hounds)<br/>
8. Make tea and muffins, invite others to join you. Set table and light <br/>
candles.<br/>
9. Cut flowers, make a bouquet<br/>
10. Bake clay creations using sculpey clay (I try to buy a fresh set of <br/>
colors every few months)<br/>
11. Use mom&#39;s binoculars to watch birds.<br/>
12. Cut paper and glue it.<br/>
13. Use the Prismacolors to draw (refer to &quot;how to draw&quot; books on book <br/>
shelves)<br/>
14. Draw with sidewalk chalk<br/>
15. Play in the creek<br/>
16. Play the piano or saxophone or guitar<br/>
17. Go online and play a game on the Internet, or X Box Live<br/>
18. Pop popcorn; watch a movie<br/>
19. Start a fire (winter, in the fireplace. Summer; in the outdoor <br/>
fireplace) roast hotdogs or marshmellows.<br/>
20. Make popsicles.<br/>
21. Read a book<br/>
22. Memorize a poem<br/>
23. Write a poem<br/>
24. Choreograph a dance in the living room<br/>
25. Write on your bedroom walls things you want to remember - song <br/>
lyrics, friend&#39;s names, funny jokes<br/>
26. Keep a scrapbook<br/>
27. Take some pictures<br/>
28. Make origami<br/>
29. Make and hang Chinese lanterns from a string across the kitchen<br/>
30. Play croquet or badminton<br/>
31. Bake cookies<br/>
32. Write a letter or email<br/>
33. Have a water fight<br/>
34. Rearrange your bedroom furniture<br/>
35. Plant seeds or flowers<br/>
36. Write your own myth or legend after reading the Greek myths<br/>
37. Clean out your wardrobe to make space for new clothes<br/>
38. Sit in a tree and whistle<br/>
39. Take a walk with a bottle of water<br/>
40. Create a cozy hiding place (blankets, pillow) and bring your <br/>
headphones/CD player to it. Sit quietly reading or listening or <br/>
snoozing.<br/>
<br/>
That should be enough to get anyone started. :)<br/>

I suggest you spend time reading some of the books that were recommended <br/>
earlier.  Some of them have lots of suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778260817">Road trip?  <br/>
<br/>
Surely, there are interesting shops, businesses, &quot;things&quot; to see?  <br/>
This reminds me of my sister - years ago she lived in an apartment <br/>
and had no yard, but did have a small patio area.  She bought pots, <br/>
dirt, seedlings, etc. and basically had a miniature farm on her <br/>
patio.  I called it the back 40 (more like the back 4).  She sure <br/>
managed to produce some great vegetables and beautiful flowers.  We <br/>
now have an even smaller portion of dirt we call our own.  It&#39;s in <br/>
the corner of our concrete patio... It&#39;s about 3 by 2 feet.  So far <br/>
it&#39;s been used for digging and driving hot wheels cars in.  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking about actually trying to plant something in there... I have <br/>
a black thumb though.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was a kid in Chicago... quite urban that, I found <br/>
it pretty magical when I saw those plants coming up in the cracks in <br/>
the sidewalk.  And our thing was walking a couple of blocks to the <br/>
ice cream shop.  Playing on the stoop of the apartment building... <br/>
Going to the big department stores.  I found the city pretty <br/>
entertaining when I was a kid.  Riding the buses and trains.  Oh! <br/>
and going for walks... every block or two you were in a <br/>
different &quot;country&quot; with the way the communities were set up.  <br/>
<br/>
Great museums there too. I found myself more bored (as a child) when <br/>
we left the city... I rather miss it now that you bring it up.  <br/>
<br/>
What city are you in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086982001">Tina, You live in MI right?<br/>
<br/>
We just moved to MI a few months ago and these are a few of the things that we do when we need to get out of the house...<br/>
<br/>
Go to Cranbrook and explore, look at all the cool stuff <br/>
<br/>
Go to Papa Joes and taste all the samples, talk to the fish monger, the butcher, the chefs, ask questions...almost everyone there is happy to talk to you. (Your son may really enjoy this)<br/>
<br/>
Spend hours in Borders looking at all the books and magazines. Listen to the music, stike up a conversation with someone looking at the same books/section as you. <br/>
<br/>
Go to Eastern Market, we did this this weekend and had sooooo much fun! If the sight of a butcher shop doesn&#39;t bother you, and if they aren&#39;t to busy, many of the butchers are more than happy to talk to your kids<br/>
<br/>
Summerset Mall and Great Lakes Crossing are both favorites for my kids, during the day, when they aren&#39;t busy, they can run around and check out stuff without all the crowds getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Downtown Royal Oak and Downtown Bhirmingham are fun to wonder around in and window shop. <br/>
<br/>
We love to go to Whole Foods and chat with the bakers.<br/>
<br/>
A trip to Ann Arbor is in the works, now that it&#39;s starting to warm up.<br/>
<br/>
There are a ton of museams downtown. And the zoo if always fun.<br/>
<br/>
I hope these ideas help, I understand being board...it&#39;s been strange for us living in a new state with seasons(we moved here form San Diego.) We&#39;ve always been used to being outside and knowing our area and having to find stuff to do and deal with the weather has been a challange, but a fun one.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420803258">You know, I never thought of visiting local businesses.  I guess it&#39;s <br/>
just out of my comfort zone, not visiting businesses but the busy-<br/>
ness of the city.  What wonderful opportunities we must be missing.  <br/>
I never would have thought of it just because I truly detest walking <br/>
in my neighborhood.  There are SO many cars!<br/>
<br/>
We live in Roseville, MI right where I-94 and I-696 meet.  We are <br/>
surrounded by two expressways, one two lane busy road and one six <br/>
lane divided highway.  Our lives are so fast paced that I spend my <br/>
time trying to get away from the traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time for Mom to step out of her comfort zone and venture <br/>
into the neighborhood.  Who knows?  Maybe we&#39;ll find something that <br/>
we didn&#39;t know was there.  I&#39;m not too confident as there is no down <br/>
town persay.  It&#39;s just a through way, but you never know unless you <br/>
try, right?<br/>
<br/>
Tina, who won&#39;t miss the city when she leaves :):)<br/>
