I&#39;ve used borax a few times as a laundry booster or as a deodorizer. I<br/>
hesitate to use it more, though, because I&#39;ve heard it can be harmful. In<br/>
fact, I thought someone had told me it was banned as a cleaning tool in some<br/>
European countries because of its harmful effects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979037288">This is all I could find,(short search, not much patince this a.m. with the <br/>
puter), others stated it is toxic if ingested. Does anyone have any more <br/>
info?<br/>

<br/>
borax or sodium tetraborate decahydrate (s�dm t��trb�r�t dk��h�drt) (KEY), <br/>
chemical compound, Na2B4O7�10H2O; sp. gr. 1.73; slightly soluble in cold <br/>
water; very soluble in hot water; insoluble in acids. Borax is a colorless, <br/>
monoclinic crystalline salt; it also occurs as a white powder. It readily <br/>
effloresces, especially on heating. It loses all water of hydration when <br/>
heated above 320�C and fuses when heated above 740�C; a �borax bead� so <br/>
formed is used in chemical analysis (see bead test). Borax is widely and <br/>
diversely used, e.g., as a mild antiseptic, a cleansing agent, a water <br/>
softener, a corrosion inhibitor for antifreeze, a flux for silver soldering, <br/>
and in the manufacture of enamels, shellacs, heat-resistant glass (e.g., <br/>
Pyrex), fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other chemicals. It is sometimes <br/>
used as a preservative but is toxic if consumed in large doses. Naturally <br/>
occurring borax (sometimes called tincal) is found in large deposits in the <br/>
W United States (Borax Lake in Death Valley, Calif.; Nevada; and Oregon) and <br/>
in the Tibet region of China. Borax can also be obtained from borate <br/>
minerals such as kernite, colemanite, or ulexite. California is the chief <br/>
source of borate minerals in the United States.<br/>
