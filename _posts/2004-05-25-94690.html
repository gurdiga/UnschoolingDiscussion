the time it&#39;s been my big sewing scissors when we couldn&#39;t find her little<br/>

something you dangle over a kids head for good behaviour, too much like<br/>
rewards. I can&#39;t fit privledges into the context of my life right now. My<br/>
daughter has scissors privlidges I guess but simply because she went and<br/>
used them, not because I deemed she was ready. My two year old has outlet<br/>
privledges but simply because he went and learned how to plug stuff in not<br/>
because I deemed him mature enough. I suppose the difference may be that I<br/>
watch my kids take on new responsibilities and &#39;priviledges&#39; as they<br/>
themselves decide they&#39;re ready and able and you prefer to issue them as you<br/>
see them conform to your idea of maturity?<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to riff on privileges a bit, since I used that word in my post as<br/>
well and would like to hear what folks here have to say about it.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the sentiment Dawn&#39;s expressing above, but I think that there<br/>
are different ways of using the word &quot;privilege.&quot; Sometimes privileges are<br/>
used as rewards for conforming to expected behaviors, which is what Dawn&#39;s<br/>
balking at, I think--and I do, too when those expectations are knee-jerk and<br/>
unexamined. But, I do believe that there are such things as &quot;privilege&quot; and<br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; that can be used in the absence of this kind of behavior<br/>
training. Maybe they can&#39;t be; maybe we need different words altogether, I<br/>
don&#39;t know. I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m wanting to explore here. I think there<br/>
is a balance to be struck between a knee-jerk revoking of privileges and a<br/>
careful explanation and exploration of what &quot;privilege&quot; means. Does that<br/>
make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Some practical examples:<br/>
 I think that the privilege of using scissors or a knife comes with the<br/>
responsibility of using them appropriately, though I definitely believe in<br/>
redirecting or figuring out alternative ways of exploring an undesirable<br/>
use. Don&#39;t cut new clothes with scissors, but do cut old clothes, fabric<br/>
scraps, etc. Don&#39;t use the knife to carve the table or other furniture; do<br/>
use the knife to carve soap, balsam wood, etc.  The privilege of having toy<br/>
swords comes with the responsibility of not hitting one&#39;s sisters or the dog<br/>
with them. (Gosh, I hate it when all my examples are about my little guy!)<br/>
Basically, I&#39;ve tried to redirect, offer alternatives, and as a last resort<br/>
remove the privilege until &quot;you&#39;re ready to try again.&quot; This isn&#39;t done<br/>
punitively, and the decision is always theirs as to when they are ready to<br/>
try again--sometime in 5 min, 5 hours or the next day. That&#39;s pretty much<br/>
what happened with the crayons in my example in the other post. They would<br/>
try again, and the mad crayoner would strike again. *g* Eventually, though,<br/>
these things get worked through without too much ado.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

I agree that there is the &quot;I awarded you a privilege&quot; (like a furlough for <br/>
doing best in basic training or some such) and the leeway/freedom parents allow <br/>
a child to have because they just trust him.<br/>
<br/>
All our kids have the privilege of getting into our cash and getting what <br/>
they need.  They ask first if we&#39;re there to ask.  None of them has ever abused <br/>
it.  They bring us change when they use our money.  They tell us what they <br/>
spent.  If Holly says &quot;Can I have my allowance?&quot; I might say &quot;get it out of Ke<br/>
ith&#39;s wallet,&quot; or &quot;here&#39;s $5 and get the rest out of my change cup.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty came and said &quot;I&#39;m going with Ryan to play games at <br/>
[somebody&#39;s house I don&#39;t know].&quot;   I didn&#39;t quibble about the fact that he hadn&#39;t <br/>
asked me, he was just telling me.  We both knew his evening was free.  He must <br/>
REALLY have wanted to go, since he was turning off a new and exciting online <br/>
video game to go, and Ryan&#39;s just lately back from college for summer so they&#39;re <br/>
excited to hang out with him.  And Kirby wasn&#39;t going, just Marty!  (Kirby was <br/>
still at karate and needed to work the next morning.)<br/>
<br/>
I asked who the guy was whose house they were going to, and whether Ryan had <br/>
the same cellphone number I have on file.  Satisfied with the answers, I said <br/>
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Gave him $5 for a burger.  Was happy to see him go so merrily away.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s privelege or trust or ebb and flow or long leash or what.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>although sandra&#39;s use of &quot;ebb and flow&quot; in this post is in a particular context, i&#39;d like to comment that it&#39;s a good way to describe many (if not all) aspects of parenting.  it&#39;s an important concept to keep in mind when they&#39;re babies -- for example, when concerned about if their nutrition is well-rounded, the truth with my kids has been that it ebbs and flows on a daily, even weekly basis -- but &quot;in the end&quot; (!), yes it&#39;s well-rounded.  in terms of unschooling for me, as i made the transition a few months ago, i was plagued by the workbook-monster whispering doubts in my ears about whether my kids are &quot;doing enough.&quot;  i&#39;ll admit i&#39;m no veteran, but i&#39;ve grown by leaps and bounds since then (compared to light-years that i have to go to have lived the wisdom some of you have!).  in any case, the workbook-monster is quite dead now, and i&#39;m left with days we&#39;ll make popcorn and watch movies together and days we garden together and days i hardly see them even though we&#39;re in the same<br/>
 house!  so, even what we do ebbs and flows, but i strive to remember that it will &quot;ebb and flow&quot; and that &quot;in the end&quot; (!) we&#39;re doing great!  and we get to relax and enjoy each other.<br/>
