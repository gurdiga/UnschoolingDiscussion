Yes.  I had told him when I first saw him that I was a homeopath and <br/>
had been taking homeopathic remedies from the moment I had fallen and <br/>
injured my ankle.  His comment implied that he thought homeopathic <br/>
remedies were some kind of hocus pocus.  I did not bother trying to <br/>
explain hundreds of years of medical history to him.  <br/>
<br/>
Most MDs have been thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that anything <br/>
outside of allopathic pill and surgery pushing medicine is hocus <br/>
pocus.  Doesn&#39;t matter that the better part of the rest of the world <br/>
uses homeopathy extensively.  It doesn&#39;t fit the American consumer <br/>
and profit-driven medical model so our medical schools and their <br/>
graduates are taught that it is worthless.  Worthless to whom?  To <br/>
the person with a chronic condition being told that there is no cure <br/>
and that they will have to use this suppressive cream or pop these <br/>
palliative pills for the rest of their lives and just live with it?  <br/>
Or worthless to the big medical monopoly machine that keeps pumping <br/>
out profit to everyone who totally buys into it, except, of course, <br/>
the consumer?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that the British and French and Germans and most of the <br/>
rest of the world, are stupid.  And they use homeopathy for about 40-<br/>
60% of their socialized medical care, for everyone.  It is a well-<br/>
known fact that the Royal Family of England has long relied on <br/>
homeopathic care, almost exclusively.  But here in our capitalistic <br/>
profit-driven reality the MDs, who sleep with the hospital <br/>
corporations, who sleep with the insurance companies, who sleep with <br/>
the pharmaceutical companies, we cannot have easy access to this type <br/>
of simple, safe, effective healing. <br/>
<br/>
Every year our FDA bans more homeopathic remedies, the same remedies, <br/>
by the way, that they declare are nothing more than placebos, or <br/>
sugar pills.  Duh?  How come they have to ban sugar pills?  If there <br/>
is nothing in them and they are just fake, why ban specific ones?  Go <br/>
figure. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough of my rant.  At least I still have a certain amount of <br/>
freedom of speech in this country, if not much else these days.<br/>
