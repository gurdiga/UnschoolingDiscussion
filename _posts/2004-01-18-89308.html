<div id="ygrps-yiv-847331008">This morning started out innocently enough.  We all slept late.  <br/>
Morning is always time for cuddling, especially Ben (our &quot;special&quot; <br/>
kid...pdd-nos). He loves &quot;snuggling&quot;.  I snuggle him to bed, I <br/>
snuggle him in the morning when he comes in to our room.  The kids <br/>
went down and played with a new playdoh toy, after having breakfast.  <br/>
All was well. NOw, I know there are some Feingolders here (we used to <br/>
be) I have to say out front, the behavior I am about to mention is <br/>
something that never changed on all the diets we tried.  It is the <br/>
most difficult of all his issues and springs out of nowhere.  One <br/>
never knows when an &quot;incident&quot; will occur.<br/>
<br/>
So, Robert (my dh their dad) comes into the living room and starts <br/>
play fighting. Everything is fine, Ben is laughing, having a blast <br/>
being launched onto the couch, Autumn, our almost 4 year old joins in <br/>
the fun. Ben has SID issues (obvious) and loves proprioceptive input <br/>
(a crash bang kid).  So he&#39;s throwing punches and stuff.  Then I <br/>
join in because Robert is &quot;under attack&quot; and then Ben&#39;s play gets <br/>
rough, he is out to get &quot;me&quot;.  He loves me more than anyone in the <br/>
world. But his anger toward me at the same time is immense. Once he <br/>
seems to cross a line he really wants to hurt the hell out of me.  I <br/>
ran upstairs and enlisted the help of my 14 year old, Andrew, who is <br/>
always happy to kick some butt (g).  Actually, he is a very peaceful <br/>
kid, but he&#39;s huge 6ft and 180 pounds.  SO he&#39;s a great shield.  Then <br/>
I ran downstairs and hid in my husband&#39;s office  til Robert and <br/>
Andrew could grab Ben and protect me from him.  When I thought I was <br/>
in  the clear, Ben found me and started punching the crap out of me. <br/>
Robert has him now, and is trying to calm him down. We sometimes call <br/>
this &quot;Hulk&quot; behavior, because Ben enjoys rough housing, but sometimes <br/>
he can cross the threshold and he is suddenly green with rage and is <br/>
my 7 year old Hulk. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious how many of you deal with this <br/>
stuff, and what you do about it? Ben just came up and told me that he <br/>
talked with Dad and what happens is he thinks the fight is real and <br/>
he has to really get me. It&#39;s like this is that difficulty with <br/>
pretend play stuff. Robert came up and told me that Ben (at 7) is so <br/>
worried about stuff WAY in the future. How is going to get a job, <br/>
what if he gets lost on the way there.  How is he going to know what <br/>
toys to buy his kids, which toys to give to charity when his kids out <br/>
grow them.  Then he told Robert that he (Robert) needs to teach Ben <br/>
these things so he can be a grown up.  Robert answered that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t teach these things to Andrew (14) and that Ben should just <br/>
enjoy being a kid, but if Ben really wants him to he will. Ugh? You <br/>
think you have an idea of what&#39;s floating <br/>
around in your kid&#39;s head, and you have really have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Then, worst of all, Robert says to me that he thinks we really should <br/>
consider special ed school for Ben, even if it is only a few days a <br/>
week.  I asked what he thought that could possibly accomplish for <br/>
Ben, other than teach him that when you are full of rage you get sent <br/>
away from your loving family.  He understood, but he said that his <br/>
conversation with Ben suggested to him that Ben feels out of control <br/>
of things because he doesn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; about them. Granted, I have <br/>
posted here before that Ben says he wants to know how to read, but he <br/>
isn&#39;t interested in learning how to go about that. What do <br/>
unschoolers say about a kid that is asking to be able to master a <br/>
skill and wants your help, but then has no patience for when you try <br/>
and give the asked for help. Is &quot;teaching&quot; always EVIL, or is it <br/>
necessary sometimes?  I really don&#39;t have a clue.  Here I am letting <br/>
this kid enjoy his life. I think it&#39;s going great, then he yells at <br/>
as that we are preparing him for his future. What the hell??? FYI, I <br/>
have read the various essays on Sandra&#39;s site regarding special needs <br/>
kids, and spend some time on the unschooling.com msg boards of the <br/>
same topic. For those that don&#39;t have a kid like this, it may be <br/>
difficult to understand, that in the back of my mind, I get scared of <br/>
the idea that when Ben is 14 and huge, if he gets that mad at me, he <br/>
could really hurt me. It scares me for both of us, because he if <br/>
really hurt me in a fit of blind rage, his remorse when it was over <br/>
would verge on suicide. He has already shown this side of himself at <br/>
7 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
This is a child who was nursed til he was 5. Slept with us til he was <br/>
almost 6. Has been unschooled, except for a brief 3 days per week for <br/>
5 weeks stint in special ed class 2 years ago, at 5 (which was a <br/>
nightmare I don&#39;t wish to repeat, though every one is bearing down on <br/>
me to reapeat it.) He has been on meds for a year (for anxiety) and <br/>
prior to that we did every natural diet, remedy, supplements in order <br/>
to prevent meds. I am a concerned, educated, very in love with my <br/>
children mother, who only wants the best for me kids. My husband, who <br/>
may not be on board, totally, with unschooling, has come a long way. <br/>
Most of all, he loves his kids desperately too. He is so concerned <br/>
and worried about his Ben. These kind of &quot;incidents&quot; scare the living <br/>
sh*t out of us. Okay, I&#39;m ready, everyone with <br/>
an opinion...FIRE AWAY.<br/>

wrote) that this activity is just too much for him to handle.  Too much <br/>
stimulation and he doesn&#39;t have the ablility to know the difference <br/>
between fighting and playing.  Just don&#39;t do it anymore and you likely <br/>
won&#39;t cause him to have that sort of reaction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rachel - this kind of anxiety about the future unknown is not unusual <br/>
among really super imaginative bright kids - sometimes to the point of <br/>
really affecting them, like it seems to be for Ben.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have real &quot;answers&quot; - sometimes it helps to give them real true <br/>
and very specific information, but sometimes that makes things <br/>
worse,too, because they aren&#39;t able to evaluate probabilities very well <br/>
so things that are highly unlikely seem just as likely to happen as <br/>
anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I once was sitting around a campfire with some families and the topic <br/>
turned to brush fires we were experiencing - about a hundred miles away <br/>
from where we were. Later I found out that one little girl there was <br/>
completely immobilized with fear, the whole night, thinking that fires <br/>
might come and burn us all up. She was about 7 or 8 years old and her <br/>
mom apparently tried to explain to her that the fires were far away, <br/>
etc., but she had &quot;gotten it&quot; that they were in our state and that just <br/>
felt too scary to her. The problem was that she could really visualize <br/>
it - and those visions were terrifying to her.<br/>
<br/>
I think you just have to use your own judgment on a situation by <br/>
situation basis - talk to him a LOT and work really really hard to be <br/>
sure he has a chance to express his worries about the future and <br/>
reassure him with real information and facts, when you can.<br/>
<br/>
School would be awful, don&#39;t you think? They&#39;ll make him think he&#39;ll <br/>
never by okay.<br/>

<br/>
Rachel<br/>
*******************************<br/>
Rachel, I absolutely think you SHOULD be scared, for you and for Ben. If at 7 <br/>
he gets so violent that you are in danger of being hurt and need help, you <br/>
need to work this out now.<br/>
<br/>
When Julian was little his dad would play active games with him that would <br/>
excite and thrill Julian. At first he&#39;d be having a great time and laughing, but <br/>
suddenly he would fall apart and start to cry. Lots of guys do that with <br/>
children, and it&#39;s hard to know when it&#39;s too much and when to stop. <br/>
<br/>
My first suggestion is that no adult (or bigger kid) should initiate this <br/>
kind of play in your house. Ben can&#39;t control the feelings that come up, and it&#39;s <br/>
not fair to him. This is one place where you CAN control the environment so <br/>
he isn&#39;t in this position. <br/>
<br/>
If Ben initiates a very active game, the adults involved should find a way to <br/>
deflect the game so it&#39;s not a fighting game. It can still be active, but not <br/>
have implications that it could be anything real or serious where he could <br/>
feel out of control.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that might help is to have a &quot;safe word.&quot; When Julian was <br/>
little he liked to be tickled, but it was vital that he (or anyone else in the <br/>
family) could feel in control of it. So if someone said &quot;Tipper Gore&quot; it stopped <br/>
immediately.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t going to eliminate his issues of rage and violent reactions, <br/>
because they may still come up in other contexts. But this is not a kid who needs <br/>
the pressure of play fighting. He must feel horrible when it happens, and when <br/>
he gets bigger it COULD be a real problem.<br/>
<br/>
Sending Ben to school will NOT make it better. It will be more stress. But <br/>
you could ask him what he wants to know for when he&#39;s grown up, and tell him <br/>
you&#39;ll make sure he knows those things. Ask him if he&#39;d like to learn to cook, or <br/>
do laundry, or help you do something for his little sister, so he can learn <br/>
to be a good dad if he wants someday.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s feeling bad about reading (which sucks, given that he&#39;s only 7!), <br/>
tell him that different people learn to read in different ways, and that you&#39;ll <br/>
work together to find HIS way, so it can be fun. Remind him that learning is <br/>
supposed to be fun. We can help brainstorm ideas for learning to read for him.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is not bad or good, or even contradictory to unschooling. Julian has <br/>
a teacher for a course he&#39;s taking, and he has a guitar teacher. The <br/>
difference is that he chooses what he wants to learn, and chooses to have teachers for <br/>
those things. If Ben WANTS you to teach a particular skill, just make sure <br/>
you teach him in the way he wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
But, more than anything else, I&#39;d stop the play fighting in the house. <br/>
Adult-initiated fighting games like that can be scary and feel out-of-control for <br/>
kids with much calmer natures than Ben, and for Ben it seems really important, <br/>
however much fun it seems at first.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with those who&#39;ve said play-fighting isn&#39;t good for this child at <br/>
this time.<br/>
Would he have any interest in karate or something like that, where they could <br/>
help him use his strength but at the same time teach him when and how NOT to <br/>
use it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570413114">I never play-fought when I was a kid. My family just wasn&#39;t like <br/>
that. So I don&#39;t have childhood experience with it... but I do have <br/>
adult experience with it. And some of the feelings that came up as <br/>
an adult were so intense and angry that I wondered if it would have <br/>
been even more so for me as a child (because I do remember feeling <br/>
things very intensely, in general, as a child.)<br/>
<br/>
This is what I felt: my boyfriend at the time would start out by <br/>
initiating some playful wrestling, even affectionate. It would <br/>
almost always turn into something, though, that wasn&#39;t just about us <br/>
being physical with each other in a positive way. It was subtly <br/>
aggressive and competitive, and well, he was stronger than me. I <br/>
cannot begin to tell you how filled with rage that our &quot;fighting&quot; <br/>
was not equal, that he had the upper hand and I felt weaker. I would <br/>
really want to hurt him I would be so angry. But I had the ability <br/>
to control that impulse -- I can imagine it being harder for some <br/>
people to do so, perhaps especially a special needs child for whom <br/>
it is too much to handle on top of all the other every day <br/>
frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
I agree totally with Kathryn, who wrote: &quot;My first suggestion is <br/>
that no adult (or bigger kid) should initiate this kind of play in <br/>
your house.[...] If Ben initiates a very active game, the adults <br/>
involved should find a way to deflect the game so it&#39;s not a <br/>
fighting game. It can still be active, but not have implications <br/>
that it could be anything real or serious where he could feel out of <br/>
control.&quot; ... or, I would add, where imbalance of power could be an <br/>
issue.<br/>
