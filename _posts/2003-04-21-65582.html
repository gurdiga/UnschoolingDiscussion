24th, and in Greensboro on the 26th -- write me if need more details.<br/>
<br/>
I write for both Home Ed. Magazine and for Life Learning and I like <br/>
them both. Of course, the way I look at it is that if there is one <br/>
good article that sticks in my brain and that I find I can really use <br/>
with my kids, the magazine has done its job! I don&#39;t think my <br/>
expectations are too low -- and I always prefer to be challenged <br/>
rather than coddled (even if I disagree with an author&#39;s perspective.)<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I really enjoy about Life Learning is that it does <br/>
not confine itself to the education of children, but usually has at <br/>
least one article on education in another part of the lifecycle. If <br/>
continue to think of ourselves as learning beings throughout our <br/>
lives, it cannot fail but rub off on our kids. (But even if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t, we have gained immensely in the process.)<br/>

You were here last year? No way!! I missed it. Bummer. :-( <br/>

I tend to stay away from any of the UHEA sponsored things as they <br/>
usually just depress me with all the curriculum and schedules and way-<br/>
too-conservative-for-me talk. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, after I gave my keynote, with 2,400 people present (they<br/>
piped into another room), and after they gave me a standing ovation in<br/>
the middle of line that barely gets a yawn in more liberal circles, I<br/>
had lunch with the movers and shakers and asked how it was that an<br/>
unreconstructed advocate of child-led/family-centered learning (and<br/>
radical Quaker to boot) was so popular out there. (And let me be<br/>
clear: I pulled no punches about my allegiances.) And the head of the<br/>
LDS Homes Education Association explained it to me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You see,&quot; he said, when we look down the dinner table, there are 8,<br/>
9, or 10, or 11 of us. Once we&#39;ve done the curriculum thing with the<br/>
oldest, we KNOW we couldn&#39;t possibly stand doing it with next passel!<br/>
So we have to seek out alternatives.&quot;<br/>
