take pretty much anything that&#39;s of an electronic nature and they will fix<br/>
it up and find a new home for it (usually the school system.)  There are<br/>
some things you have to pay a fee for, like monitors, but it&#39;s a lot better<br/>
than the dump.  All donations are tax deductible.  We originally found out<br/>
about it from our local school district.  Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just a CA<br/>
thing, or a Silicon Valley thing, but maybe it&#39;s becoming more common.<br/>

can offer anything but meds. Even pets on some free cycle boards. It&#39;s to<br/>
help keep the dumps from filling up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394693953">thanks for posting this.  Dh and I were just <br/>
today trying to figure out how to get rid of<br/>
our elliptical machine.  As for old electronics,<br/>
sometimes we let the kids take them apart to <br/>
explore the inside.  I think that&#39;s gotten old<br/>
though because we found our old camera and offered<br/>
them to do that today (we had a going-through-old-stuff-day)<br/>
and nobody wanted to :(  krista<br/>
