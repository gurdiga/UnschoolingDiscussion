<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503724150">This is a way cool website for weather buffs!  Just click on your  <br/>
region and have fun dragging your mouse across the data table to see  <br/>
the graphics change.  The whole NOAA website is awesome.  I spent a  <br/>
LOT of time on it during hurricanes last year.<br/>
