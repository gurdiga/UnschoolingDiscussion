<div id="ygrps-yiv-228142895">In response to &quot;Desparately Needs Help&quot;, it seems clear to me from your<br/>
email that the onus is not on your son to make dad and grandma happy with<br/>
his ability to socialize, but on you as the custodial parent and his father<br/>
as the supportive long distance parent, to have a straightforward, honest<br/>
discussion with the matriarch on who is raising this child.  You are the<br/>
parent, you have all the legal and practical responsibilities and you will<br/>
make the decisions on what approach to education makes sense for your son.<br/>
Take the pressure off your son - and hurry!  Let him be the kid he is and<br/>
reassure him that, no matter what grandma says about whether he should be in<br/>
school or not, she will not be making the decision.  You, as his nurturing,<br/>
caring mother, will.  You will help him to achieve whatever he wants,<br/>
period.  That is what a mother does.<br/>
