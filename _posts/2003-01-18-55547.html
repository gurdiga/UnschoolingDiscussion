<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Patti, what have you done when your kids get the interrogation? <br/>
&gt; My poor 13 yodd went to dinner at a friend&#39;s house last night. <br/>
&gt; These are the support group leaders for our homeschool group. <br/>
&gt; My dd had shared a bit with her friend about our decision to put <br/>
&gt; the reins in the hands of the kids for their education. I made <br/>
&gt; certain that when she shared with her friends that she be careful <br/>
&gt; not to say, &quot;We don&#39;t have to do school any more.&quot; However, no <br/>
&gt; matter how it gets explained, I&#39;m finding out that kids hear &quot;They <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t do school any more.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> My children are not of school age or a teenager so I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d <br/>
handle it or how they&#39;d handle it.  I remember recently when My children and <br/>
I were at a neighbor&#39;s house and they had family over.  I was talking with a <br/>
few ladies at the table and they asked me if my daughter was in pre-school.  <br/>
I said no, she&#39;s learning at home.  During our discussion my daughter and a <br/>
little boy, who was almost 5, were laughing and playing at the table.  The <br/>
father of the little boy came over and started drilling my daughter.  He <br/>
started asking her questions.  My daughter just stared at him and never <br/>
answered any of his questions.  His son answered all of the questions.  At <br/>
first I didn&#39;t understand why he was asking so many questions and then I <br/>
realized he must have been listening to the conversation about my daughter <br/>
not going to preschool and his son going to preschool.  He left the table <br/>
with a proud smile on his face.  He was proud that his son could regurgitate <br/>
facts on command, but my daughter couldn&#39;t answer any of his questions.  My <br/>
daughter didn&#39;t seem to care and nor did I.  I knew my daughter knew the <br/>
answers, but didn&#39;t want to answer them.  It did give me an insight as to <br/>
what might happen to her as she gets older.  Adults will be questioning her <br/>
and finding out what she&#39;s learning.  At this point, it doesn&#39;t bother me, <br/>
but it might when she gets older, and if she feels hurt or belittled from the <br/>
questions.  I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do then.  Knowing me, I&#39;ll inform them and <br/>
give them more information than what they&#39;ll need.<br/>
<br/>
This impressed them, but the skepticism didn&#39;t go away that <br/>
easily. They all decided that my daughter is an exceptionally <br/>
motivated, unique &quot;good&quot; girl. (This is what I&#39;ve always <br/>
heard--&quot;Your kids are really neat. My kids aren&#39;t like yours. They <br/>
don&#39;t have interests. They would veg out all day in front of the TV <br/>
so I have to require things of them...&quot;) We&#39;ve always appeared to <br/>
be very unstructured compared to everyone we know. And my <br/>
kids have always had a lot of diverse interests that they pursue <br/>
on their own.<br/>
<br/>
What parents don&#39;t realize is how quickly kids can become interested and <br/>
motivated on their own if they only had the opportunity.  I believe TV and <br/>
other things are a way for kids (and adults) to get a way from the real <br/>
world, which isn&#39;t very fun, and to veg out in fantasy land.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think kids should have to defend their way of schooling, but if they <br/>
want certain people to understand and want to take the time to explain what <br/>
they do and have done in the past week, they can do that.  If there are <br/>
people in their lives who keep asking questions, seem ignorant about what <br/>
unschooling, relaxed schooling or homeschooling, she can supply them with <br/>
some materials to read, a list of what she&#39;s learning, a portfolio or <br/>
scrapbook of some of the things she&#39;s done and any other information that <br/>
might satisfy their curiosities and answer some of their questions.  If your <br/>
daughter seems to be upset about all of the questions and feels they are only <br/>
asked in a sarcastic, mean, and hurtful way, maybe you can talk to whomever <br/>
is interrogating her.<br/>
<br/>
I think the term &quot;Unschooling&quot; is a word that adults interpret as kids not <br/>
having to learn.  They just do what they want, which would never include <br/>
reading, learning measurements by building a birdhouse, learn the parts of a <br/>
flower by planting flowers and observing their parts, learn geography by <br/>
studying the migration of different birds, etc.  The idea that kids can learn <br/>
without someone dictating to them what they have to learn is too hard for <br/>
most people to digest.  They can&#39;t seem to get past the idea that if someone <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them, how will they learn?  They don&#39;t seem to realize that <br/>
their children can be just like your daughter, ie. full of curiosities, lots <br/>
of motivation to learn, and be independent about their learning.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to ask someone who is more experienced with unschooling older <br/>
children.<br/>
