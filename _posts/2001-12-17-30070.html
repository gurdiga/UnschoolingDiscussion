<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707846809"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;we are havung a very difficult time finding one who will. . . so far, <br/>
&gt;probablu 25 or so have said no, and we will not vacinnate, well, its Lelias <br/>

&gt;homeopathic people doctors.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recently spoke with a person regarding this very subject. Apparently, <br/>
they have tested many, but not all, brands of vacs for animals, for some <br/>
reason they are more &#39;pure&#39;, with less additives than the human ones. <br/>
(sans thirmasol and other ingredients that slip my mind right now)<br/>
<br/>
So I asked what they thought about them. The answer was to get the rabies <br/>
shot. That was important. But don&#39;t bother with the others, such as the <br/>
leukemias etc. They don&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Just relaying info.. take what you want from it.<br/>
