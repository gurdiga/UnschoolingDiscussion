<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079434315">I&#39;m not much help, but I think if he asks you questions that are beyond<br/>
yourself, and you suggest other sources, that is the best you can do.  If<br/>
he is uninterested in books, why not contact an engineering teacher or an<br/>
engineer?  Why not take or send him on field-trips where they build<br/>
bridges?  When my kids use &quot;never&quot; and &quot;ever&quot; words negatively about<br/>
their future, I respond with an emphatic &quot;No Way!&quot;(Wrong Answer Buzzer<br/>
Noise)  It&#39;s not your job to change your child&#39;s mind, just to say what<br/>
you believe passionately and leave it at that.  He will appreciate your<br/>
faith in him later.  It sounds like he is just bored and wants the<br/>
challenge of a debate.  The fact that your child thinks the way he does<br/>
is just awesome.  As I always say when my kids run out of things to do. <br/>
&quot;Boredom is the soil in which imagination grows.&quot;  I would like to say<br/>
that my best friend&#39;s dad never got beyond 8th grade, but joined the army<br/>
corp of engineers at seventeen.  He performed the job of a civil<br/>
engineer, but he never graduated from high school or college.  He<br/>
travelled around the world and made a very good living doing what he<br/>
loved as a foreman building roads and bridges.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639664575">My 10 year old son who has been unschooling is now suddenly talking <br/>
about how since he hates to study, he will probably end up living in <br/>
a ditch.  He says that he would like to go to college, but he knows <br/>
that he never can because he likes laying around too much.  This <br/>
child is a natural born lawyer and nothing I say will budge his <br/>

He also asks impossible questions.  He recently asked me if I would <br/>
help him create a real black hole.  He was very disappointed when I <br/>
told him that I couldn&#39;t.  He never wants to do anything easy.  He <br/>
saw a great TV show on bridge building and asked if he could build a <br/>
bridge.  I hauled out science catalogs and asked him what kind he <br/>
was interested in.  He wasn&#39;t interested in a book or a kit.  He <br/>
wanted to head down to the nearest main road and build a bridge <br/>
across it.  While I must admit that it would be handy for avoiding <br/>
the traffic, I don&#39;t believe that local ordinances would allow a 10 <br/>
year old to build a bridge across their highway.  Each of his <br/>
questions leads to many more why nots?  <br/>
<br/>
He asked if he could build a wall in our yard.  I was thrilled to be <br/>
able to say yes, but my excitement vanished with his questions about <br/>
materials.  He couldn&#39;t understand why I didn&#39;t know the relative <br/>

check for himself - from our library (Books on Architecture, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289233164">Alaura, you mentioned three words, failed, frustrated and stupid.  I just<br/>
want to say, you sound very intelligent and wise.  You sound like you are<br/>
doing things the best you can.  Your son&#39;s imagination is outstanding.  I<br/>
would rejoice in his mind, give him hands on opportunities like field<br/>
trips and expose him to engineers and scientists.  Does he have<br/>

almost like my kids imagining with their legos and clay, only on a<br/>

It is not your job to do it all.  Just thinking these things is enough<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520753269">&lt;He<br/>
wanted to head down to the nearest main road and build a bridge<br/>
across it. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Dad is an engineer and while growing up, we would have to go to these<br/>
sites under construction and see all this road work stuff. If you could take<br/>
him to a brand new road being created and let him get up close to the<br/>
stuff the equipment, the huge concrete pilings and so on, maybe it would<br/>
put things more in perspective for him.  You dont want to stifle his big<br/>
ideas but perhaps show him just how BIG they are for a 10 yr old to<br/>
accomplish!<br/>
Im a big believer in mentors and wont hesitate to ask *anybody* if my kid<br/>
can shadow them around if my kid shows a desire to do so. Maybe you could<br/>
meet the foreman and ask if ds could hang out while you sit in the car some<br/>
day for an hour or so. OR maybe you could saddle up to an architect and ask<br/>
if your ds could watch what goes on in that office for a few hours one day.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;He asked if he could build a wall in our yard.  I was thrilled to be<br/>
able to say yes,&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again if you cant manage it yourself due to finances or simply abilities,<br/>
ask someone in that particular field. He could hang around a landscaper.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;This<br/>
child is a natural born lawyer and nothing I say will budge his<br/>
opinion. &gt;<br/>
Rent some videos that have great law scenes (dont ask me which movies I<br/>
really dont know!.. isnt there some old one with Jimmy Stewart???) Im<br/>
drawing a blank on other movie suggestions but will write you offlist if I<br/>
remember any titles!<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s ten.  I&#39;d humor him totally.  Either don&#39;t discuss the future at all <br/>
(why, at this point?) or just matter-of-factly ask him which ditch he thinks <br/>
he&#39;ll live in.  But I wouldn&#39;t press him to change his mind and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
shame him about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He also asks impossible questions.  He recently asked me if I would <br/>
help him create a real black hole.  He was very disappointed when I <br/>
told him that I couldn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another opportunity for humoring him.  Ask him what he knows about black <br/>
holes and what it would take to make one.  Let him explore it and let him <br/>
figure out it can&#39;t be done instead of telling him you can&#39;t.  (That way <br/>
you&#39;re not the bad guy, he decides on his own it can&#39;t be done.)  Or I&#39;d say <br/>
&quot;Sure, when you get all the stuff in one place, I&#39;ll help you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We had a shopping list on the wall for a long time.  It had a holodeck (a la <br/>
Star Trek), an exploding stroller and a robotic swordfish.  I had told the <br/>
kids when we found them for sale, sure, we&#39;d see about buying them (after <br/>
they jokingly asked for those things, various times that I had asked what <br/>
they wanted from the store).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He couldn&#39;t understand why I didn&#39;t know the relative <br/>
strengths of cement, stone, brick, etc.  When I encouraged him to <br/>
check for himself - from our library (Books on Architecture, <br/>
Building, Science Enyclopedias etc.) or online, he lost interest.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would have looked it up for him, or discussed what I did know about <br/>
relative costs, ease of construction, requirements, building code (some walls <br/>
aren&#39;t legal in some neighborhoods; cinderblock use might require rebar <br/>
reinforcement at corners and every so often).<br/>
<br/>
Those are good unschooling opportunities.  Try not to say no; try to say yes, <br/>
or pursue it WITH him, instead of sending him off on his own.<br/>

I agree with Lynda on this, Alaura. And your son is just at that age where<br/>
it starts. My 11 yr old says some of the same things you mentioned, makes<br/>
some of those impossible requests. I dont ignore her or make fun of her,<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Another opportunity for humoring him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**He sees through any attempts to humor him.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then someone&#39;s not being honest.<br/>
<br/>
IF he asks for information about a black hole and you sincerely pursue it but <br/>
he &quot;sees through,&quot; then he wasn&#39;t sincere in his request.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;humor him&quot; I don&#39;t mean be sarcastic and condescending.  I mean go with <br/>
his premise a while even if your first response would be &quot;it won&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Much learning is in the inquiry and the attempt to figure it out.  That&#39;s why <br/>
it&#39;s better for a child to figure out the times tables on his own than for <br/>
someone to give them a pre-printed copy.  That&#39;s why if the parents TELL kids <br/>
all kinds of things instead of giving them chances (guided or assisted or <br/>
not) to figure them out the learning doesn&#39;t stick as well.  Because it was <br/>
learning as much as it was exposure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I spent an hour reading about black holes with him. He really <br/>
believes that it is possible to create one.  I told him that I would <br/>
be glad to help him, but that he would have to lead because I can&#39;t <br/>
see how to do it.  He gets this look that says &quot;GEE I wish I had a <br/>
smart mother.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I save stuff like this in writing in &quot;diaries&quot; I keep on them, and show it to <br/>
them in a couple of years.  He&#39;ll think you were smart to have offered to <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Ask him what it would take to go and look at a black hole in situ.  How much <br/>
are the Russians charging for a ride?  And how long would it take them to get <br/>
near a black hole?  And how close could their spaceship get?   He&#39;ll see the <br/>
absurdity if he hasn&#39;t already and is just baiting you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-By 3pm he was determined to create his own planet and wanted to know <br/>
why we couldn&#39;t create a fire as hot as the sun.  (this was not an <br/>
academic question - it was more like wanting to know why people are <br/>
so limited.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Marty, when he was little, asked me &quot;Mom, if someone counts to infinity, is <br/>
that illegal?&quot;  (Turns out I had told him &quot;you can&#39;t count to infinity,&quot; and <br/>
he took it as there being a rule against it.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-He just seems to have a need to know <br/>
everything. -=-<br/>
<br/>
By the time he&#39;s through living, he&#39;ll know as much as he could possibly <br/>
stuff in then!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could ask him questions that involve him experimenting to find the <br/>
answer.  If he starts just telling you &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;you tell me,&quot; you <br/>
can say &quot;Why is it you want me to know answers but you don&#39;t know any?  Don&#39;t <br/>
you think kids can figure things out?&quot; or some such pointer toward <br/>
experimentation and inquiry.<br/>

I really like her. We bought a movie with her (name?)in it called &quot;Bring it<br/>
On&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s a cheerleading movie, yet it has some really great comedy scenes. It<br/>
pokes fun at alot of &quot;Teenhood&quot;<br/>
and the narrowness of school life.<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>

My 10 yr old is in a very &quot;angst&quot; stage, too.  And I think she struggles<br/>
between enjoying things for young nad very young children,  and a new<br/>
awareness of her expanding horizons,  power,  and knowledge as an older<br/>
child.<br/>
    She *wants* to be responsible and delve into more complex<br/>
territores.....and she *wants* to stay little and be cared for completely.<br/>
I tell her I&#39;ll continue to read with her, even after she can read well on<br/>
her own,  I hug her,  and play with her and do the best I can to spend time<br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been challenging.  She&#39;s the oldest.....and so I&#39;m still learning so<br/>
much about how to relate to her at various stages.  And the 3 yr old and<br/>
toddler take up SO much time and attention.  Especially since we&#39;re trying<br/>
to sell the house and the 3 yr old seems to add to the wall murals .....as<br/>
soon as I get one scrubbed off,  another appears.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were some other unschooling families around here to &#39;trade off&#39;<br/>
some time with!!  Or maybe Sandra and Holly could join us for<br/>
awhile......you can maintain the patience that sometimes slips away from me<br/>
lately!<br/>

Bridget, that is a *great* idea. My 11 yr old isnt into engineering but she<br/>
does love music, as Ive said before. Shes taught herself how to do a lot<br/>
of music related computer stuff and is now into designing skins for the<br/>
winamp player thing (I dont have a clue what shes doing or how!)<br/>
