&gt;Have you tried Tintin books?  They&#39;re by Herge, and they&#39;re oversized<br/>
&gt;comic book adventures of a writer and his dog during WWI and WWII.<br/>
&gt;They were initially published as serials in magazines, and are now<br/>
&gt;separate books.  My 8 year old isn&#39;t reading yet, but he loves to<br/>
&gt;have me read these (about the only thing he chooses for bedtime story<br/>
&gt;other than non-fiction).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are some &quot;collections&quot; where they have put three of the books<br/>
&gt;into a large hardcover edition, but generally there&#39;s one long story<br/>
&gt;in an oversize comic book.  There&#39;s even a collection of 6 of them on<br/>
&gt;tape.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s the link to amazon.com&#39;s list of Tintin books, so you can see<br/>
&gt;all the titles available:<br/>

All the above are done in a very cartoonish way, including the <br/>
violence.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I read them with my son, it&#39;s a great opportunity to discuss <br/>
these things, rather than pretend they don&#39;t exist.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the racism, it does exist on some level, but not with Tintin <br/>
himself.  He generally makes friends with everyone.  In one, a <br/>
Chinese friend had been lost in an airplane crash, and he risked his <br/>
life to go and find out if the friend survived the crash.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a great opportunity to discuss the changes in this world <br/>
since WWII.  &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was quite comical, considering <br/>
it was done in the late 40s/early 50s, before man ever set foot on <br/>
the moon.  Their &quot;predictions&quot; of what would happen were funny <br/>
compared with the facts we now have.<br/>
<br/>
The animated violence is like any other cartoon, and less than you <br/>
see on most TV shows these days.<br/>
<br/>
MY only objection to it is his friend, the Captain, who is also a <br/>
drunk with a temper.  He is a comical character most of the time, but <br/>
when his temper lets loose, he lets go a bunch of &quot;curses&quot; - they&#39;re <br/>
not true swearing, but &quot;blistering barnacles&quot; and the like. I usually <br/>
don&#39;t read them all aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Tintin is a good character model, as I said, often risking his life <br/>
for his friends.  He fights for the underdog, is very polite, and as <br/>
a character is probably in his early 20s.  Through him we get to see <br/>
the world.<br/>
