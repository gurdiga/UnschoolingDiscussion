&gt; As I&#39;ve shared before, my daughter and I are really into this project<br/>
&gt; of getting petitions signed so that scooters and skateboards aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; banned.  Well, we figured that in order to get finished in time, we<br/>
&gt; need to work some during the day, even when dh isn&#39;t home to watch<br/>
&gt; the boys (ages 5 and 3).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re just too young and it&#39;s just too boring, and the &quot;do this<br/>
for me and I&#39;ll do that for you&quot; is too long. At 5 and 3 it might work if<br/>
you&#39;re asking them to pick up their socks :) but not to ride quietly for<br/>
long stretches of time in a wagon.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any homeschooling families you know who might take them (and might<br/>
even have older kids who would be interested in going along to help with the<br/>
petition?) Are there maybe much-older kids (or adults) in town, of families<br/>
you know who also don&#39;t want the scooter law to pass, who would be<br/>
interested in going with your daughter while you stay home with the boys?<br/>
<br/>
Could your husband take your daughter to someplace central and busy like the<br/>
mall or outside the grocery store when he gets home from work (or you take<br/>
her while he stays with the boys) so instead of you going to the people they<br/>
basically come to you?<br/>
