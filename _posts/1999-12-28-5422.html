<br/>

&gt;You think? I&#39;m not so sure, but I do think that kids in disposable diapers<br/>
&gt;should be potty trained earlier than those in cloth, for the sake of the<br/>
&gt;landfills. Ha!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly with this statement.  Also, my children were in<br/>
cloth diapers and it was much easier to potty train them.  They knew what<br/>
it felt like when they were wet.  With disposables, IMHO, they can&#39;t feel<br/>
the wetness when they go.  It takes longer to make the connection.  Pull<br/>
Ups are horrible to use when potty training for just this reason.  I got a<br/>
book, recommended by my wonderful pediatrician, called _Potty Training In<br/>
Less than a Day_ or something like that.  He said don&#39;t expect to do it in<br/>
a day but use the tips in the book.  All of my children were potty trained<br/>
at 20 months(I have 5).  It was realitively easy and non stressful for<br/>
them.  I must admit the hardest part with the younger ones was having the<br/>
time at home to practice.  We carried the potty chair in the back of the<br/>
van for my 4th child.  Hey, it worked!!!!!<br/>

&quot;Finish every day and be done with it.   <br/>
You have done what you could;<br/>
some blunders and absurdities crept in;   <br/>
forget them as soon as you can.<br/>
Tomorrow is a new day;   <br/>
You shall begin it serenely and<br/>
with too high a spirit to be encumbered   <br/>
with your old nonsense.&quot;<br/>
