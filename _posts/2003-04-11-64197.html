<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382684039">About misbehaving:<br/>
  Like beauty, it&#39;s in the eye of the beholder.<br/>
  I had my son and grandson at the park the other day.  A few other families <br/>
were there, too.  The slides are long tubes, and the boys enjoy climbing up <br/>
them.  The other moms scolded their kids; they could only go DOWN the slides. <br/>
 To them, my boys were misbehaving.<br/>
  I was at a height/position advantage to see the top; if some other kid had <br/>
climbed the steps, and was approaching the slide, I&#39;d scoop my kid out of the <br/>
way and let the other kid go first, so there wasn&#39;t a safety issue.  There <br/>
was plenty of equipment for the kids to share, as well, so they weren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;holding up the show&quot; by taking the time to go up.<br/>
  I started to &quot;allow&quot; my son up the slide when the physical therapist <br/>
recommended it when he was little and had difficulty flexing his foot.  I <br/>
continue to let him do it because it&#39;s fun.<br/>

<br/>
I found this quote yesterday.  &quot;Intellectual misbehavior&quot; was a new concept <br/>
to me, so I saved it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The first half of this verse tells us that a child must be disciplined with <br/>
the rod and reproved for his misbehavior. Misbehavior may be manifested in a <br/>
multitude of ways, including intellectual misbehavior.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;You will by now have noticed that linguists&#39; views of grammar differ <br/>
from that of, say, your typical language teacher. We can describe <br/>
this difference concisely by saying that linguists try to describe <br/>
how people actually use language, while language teachers typically <br/>
try to prescribe how people should use language according to <br/>
arbitrarily determined &quot;standards&quot;. To be a savvy language user, a <br/>
person must understand both kinds of rules.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Dictionaries didn&#39;t always exist.  The first few that came along were what <br/>
they call (in language-study terms) &quot;prescriptive.&quot;  The dictionaries existed to <br/>
tell how things SHOULD be, so if something was wrong, or &quot;not a word&quot; in the <br/>
view of the creators of the dictionary, they  left it out.   They told you <br/>
what you SHOULD be saying/spelling/believing about what words did.<br/>
<br/>
In the 20th century there started to be &quot;descriptive&quot; dictionaries, which <br/>
listed words as they WERE being used, not primarily as a way to maintain language <br/>
in a static form (a conservative view of the purpose of language study and <br/>
teaching) but to acknowledge that it changes and to document the changes as they <br/>
are happening.<br/>
<br/>
Before that (The American Heritage Dictionary is an example of a descriptive <br/>
dictonary), dictionaries pretty much reflected the language that had been <br/>
current a few decades before, because by the time someone got to the <br/>
dictionary-writing stage, he was likely to be an elderly-getting old coot who had been <br/>
haranguing people all his life about how horrible their speech and writing were, <br/>
because it wasn&#39;t like his grandfathers, or like the old coots who taught him <br/>
when he was young.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s conservatism, in language.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the &quot;Whatever, if someone used it yesterday, let&#39;s ALL use it&quot; <br/>
group, and that&#39;s no better.<br/>
<br/>
The way things grow and change the most smoothly, I think, is if there are <br/>
conservative saying &quot;don&#39;t change it&quot; and progressives saying &quot;change it!&quot; and <br/>
the changes that happen are half way between their positions.  Then the tension <br/>
(in a physical sense of tension holding things together) keeps it from just <br/>
falling apart and keeps it from stagnating.   Halfway between dying of no <br/>
growth and fallng apart from no roots is where language (or government or culture <br/>
or businesses or families or...) move along in a stable fashion.<br/>

 <br/>
What has anyone rejected?<br/>
 <br/>
I am not Presbyterian, but I haven&#39;t rejected it. I never was  Presbyterian.<br/>
I&#39;m not vegan.  I don&#39;t want to study it to decide whether to reject  it.  <br/>
I&#39;m happy eating what I&#39;m eating.<br/>
 <br/>
If the way someone lives seems like Buddhism to you and all you think  <br/>
they&#39;re lacking is the label, how many times would you suggest to them that what  <br/>
they were calling mindfulness was the same as Zen Buddhism, and why were they  <br/>
rejecting Buddhism?<br/>
 <br/>
-=- To me when you take it <br/>
beyond your approach to your children&#39;s  education...it becomes a <br/>
parenting thing not a schooling  thing. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If it was never a schooling thing to begin with, then it was always a whole  <br/>
life thing, and there is no life-sized thing involving parents and children <br/>
that  doesn&#39;t also involve parenting.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- The part I don&#39;t get is how the <br/>
term non-coercive parenting could  have negative connotations to <br/>
someone who is wholly unschooling  (batman!).-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Does the term American Libertarian Party have any connotations to you  <br/>
whatsoever? <br/>
Whether it does or not, can you call your desire to grow whatever you want  <br/>
to in your yard and water it whenever and however you want to  libertarianism?  <br/>
SHOULD you?  That name exists and belongs to the  people who actually have a <br/>
political entity called the American Libertarian  Party.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone&#39;s doing something kind of like boy scouts, it does NOT make them  <br/>
boyscouts.<br/>
 <br/>
If there is (and there is) something specifically called  <br/>
NonCoerciveParenting NCP that was named that and has had those initials used as  thought it were <br/>
a political party or a formal organization, then only those who  <br/>
subscribe/join/follow that group should use their term/initials.  It seems  to be an all or <br/>
nothing kind of thing, focused on the coercion question. Focused  HARD on <br/>
that, like a magnifying glass focuses sunlight on an ant.  <br/>
 <br/>
That is not the focus of unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-tcs parents have to let kids do whatever they want without <br/>
regard to  their own or others feelings-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Some of us have been told (in AOL forum days) clearly that others&#39; feelings  <br/>
were their own damned problem, and that coercing a child for ANY reason was <br/>
just  the evillest thing ever.  And if a person&#39;s life decisions will all hinge  <br/>
on non-coercion, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just for the record,  I&#39;m not lobbying for the people here to  call <br/>
this kind of unschooling NCP. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Just for the record&quot; should only be used when there is no evidence to the  <br/>
contrary.  <br/>
Going on about something and suggesting that people WOULD stop avoiding the  <br/>
use of a term if they only understood it correctly IS lobbying.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The only reason I <br/>
brought this up was that it felt to me like  everyone in the room was <br/>
looking at an elephant and saying...what should we  call it??....-=-<br/>
 <br/>
We have unschooling in the room, and have been calling it that for  years.<br/>
There&#39;s no problem IN the room, the problem is outside the room, where  <br/>
people are calling elephants unschooling, and prairie dogs elephants, and ABeka  <br/>
unschooling on Fridays, and politics not-politics and lobbying not  lobbying.<br/>
 <br/>
If you prefer TCS/NCP approaches, go for it!  <br/>
 <br/>
Pressing things to meld and blend won&#39;t work when one group says &quot;no  <br/>
personal examples&quot; while the other is saying &quot;avoid theoretical and hypothetical  <br/>
questions and stories.&quot;<br/>

my mind (granted I may be doing a take what you want and leave the <br/>

more as terminology than as an organized movement.  That may be <br/>
because I haven&#39;t been around it all from the beginning, maybe I&#39;m <br/>
wrong on that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not a problem at all.  But, there was a discussion going on in <br/>
the room about whether another term would help distinguish those <br/>
that have let unschooling permiate into their whole lives from those <br/>
that took an unschooling approach to education, but still had <br/>
parental controls in areas like food, chores, etc.  All I was doing <br/>
was saying (as part of that conversation...not out of the blue) was <br/>
that in my view that&#39;s called non-coercive parenting.  And, when you <br/>
said...nah, don&#39;t like that term...too much baggage from old <br/>
lists/posting/etc. too closely tied to TCS and all those <br/>
Liberatarian lunatics.  I guess I should have said okay, I see and <br/>
dropped it.  So, why didn&#39;t I? (asking myself this) Actually I think <br/>
I know why (just writing as I think here) if you had said that...I <br/>
think I would have gotten it.  But, what you said was....ncp is <br/>
this....and described something that isn&#39;t ncp *to me*.  So, I felt <br/>
some need to defend my view of ncp....I guess so that people <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think I was advocating what you were describing.  Oh, <br/>
man...am I doing it again??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the problem is outside the room, where  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people are calling lobbying not  lobbying.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&quot;m actually trying to come in the room Sandra.  And, I hope <br/>
you won&#39;t kick me out for sending one too many posts on this topic! <br/>
(oh shoot, this one might make two too many!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; If you prefer TCS/NCP approaches, go for it!  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I came at this a little backwards from a lot of the others <br/>
here.  I started reading/thinking/experimenting with TCS, read for <br/>
over a year thinking...this is really cool and interesting...but I <br/>
have no desire to actually try it...way too scary!  Then, suddenly I <br/>
did feel like I wanted to try it.  One of the reasons I felt less <br/>
overwhelmed with the thought of trying it then, was that it was <br/>
summer....so I didn&#39;t have to figure out the school coercion part!  <br/>
So, it started with the biggies being sleep, food and media.  Then, <br/>
I found unschooling.com and realized....oh, boy...I really want to <br/>
take plunge!  So, for a year now, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how <br/>
to do that and each and every day I read on the unschooling.com <br/>
boards my resolve got stronger.  The problem for me was that I <br/>
really, really, really wanted to be the one at home with the kids.  <br/>
And no matter how many ways I tried to turn things upsidedown and <br/>
backwards to see my way clear to do that, I was stuck.  My husband <br/>
was a high school teacher before he left that to stay home with our <br/>
kids...and if he were to go back to that it would pay less than half <br/>
of what I make.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  He&#39;s been doing some <br/>
handyman business now that the kids are all in school, but that <br/>
isn&#39;t panning out to have the potential to support the family <br/>
either.  Anyway, we have finally decided to go fot it anyway and are <br/>
taking the kids out of school, with my husband at home.  Obviously, <br/>
I&#39;ll be part of it too...since we all know unschooling doesn&#39;t just <br/>
happen during school hours, but it is really hard for me to let go <br/>
of the fantasy of being the one with them all day, every day.  <br/>
<br/>
TCS opened my eyes to possibilies that intrigued me.  But, it is the <br/>
unschooling.com crew that showed me that it could really work...with <br/>
real people, real kids, real families.  So I hope you won&#39;t mind if <br/>
I stay!<br/>

What it is to you is fine for you.<br/>
What it is for the owners of this list is pertinent to its acceptance by  the <br/>
owners of the list, and will affect whether we honor the requests to change  <br/>
the subject.<br/>

I&#39;ll be part of it too...since we all know unschooling  doesn&#39;t just <br/>
happen during school hours, but it is really hard for me to let  go <br/>

don&#39;t both have to work!<br/>
