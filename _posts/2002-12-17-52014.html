<div id="ygrps-yiv-640958805">For those that don&#39;t have land or even the desire to work from sun up to<br/>
sundown to eat &lt;g&gt;, there is a way to Unjob after a set period of time,<br/>
using economic principles instead of back to nature principles to achieve<br/>
it.  My husband and I followed this book and were able to Unjob and get a<br/>
REAL life back in less than a year...great stuff.  It&#39;s also reviewed on<br/>
the whywork site that was mentioned in an earlier post...<br/>
