<div id="ygrps-yiv-866959184">HOWDY!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I appreciate what unschooling is - for the most part!  I&#39;m still <br/>
afflicted, though, with occasional bouts of CONSTIPATED THINKING (a favorite <br/>
phrase of mine, which is a term borrowed from the movie, &quot;Finding <br/>
Forrester.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I am still fighting my own way out of the box, which is within yet <br/>
another box, and yet another...you get the picture, I still sometimes grasp <br/>
for &quot;evidence&quot;  that my son is learning and will not be mentally deficient <br/>
due to lack of stimulating and educational opportunities...so I do my best <br/>
to make &quot;subject matter&quot;  available in interesting, interactive formats.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason for this is that I am a self-employed massage/manual <br/>
therapist, with my office attached to my home.  It really works out very <br/>
well, as I can allow Dylan to be home to follow his interests and make up <br/>
his own activities, while I&#39;m earning an income, utilizing the education and <br/>
experience that I&#39;ve spent many thousands of dollars and gobs of hours <br/>
acquiring, fulfilling my own life goals, all with Dylan just on the other <br/>
side of a closed door.<br/>
<br/>
In between appointments, over long lunch hours, and especially if a client <br/>
cancels, Dylan and I have time together peppered throughout the day.  <br/>
Evenings, with Dad home, brings another dimension to our family experience.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just makes me, a still-in-my-first-six-months unschooler, feel <br/>
more secure to have Dylan getting fun, interactive, learning experiences <br/>
through software and even some Nintendo games with educational content, <br/>
while Dave and I are working...then we have our family time interspersed <br/>
throughout the day, evening and on weekends.<br/>
<br/>
NATURAL MATH, in particular, seems to be a method by which to reduce the <br/>
amount of agony a child must endure to learn multiplication and geometry, <br/>
etc., by learning a few concepts and principles and then having that <br/>
information available for the rest of their lives so that they can always <br/>
quickly &quot;figure it out&quot;  for themselves, if and when they need to.  <br/>
Primarily, I&#39;m looking for the materials SO I CAN TEACH MYSELF the <br/>
principles, then mentor my son as the opportunities present themselves in a <br/>
more natural way. I&#39;m anxious about math, as that&#39;s an area in which I&#39;ve <br/>
always felt deficient.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan is slowly starting to develop some interests, again, and that is <br/>
certainly helping me focus some of my energies for his benefit. Having <br/>
brought home a Calvin & Hobbes comic book for my husband the other day, <br/>
Dylan snapped it up (not having any interest in reading ANYTHING since his <br/>
Public School experience), and he ready 24 pages the first night.  He looked <br/>
ahead to see how many pages there were, estimated how many days of reading <br/>
he had available to him, based on 24 pages a night, and read for only three <br/>
more nights before he refused to read anymore.  Apparently, he never wanted <br/>
the adventure to end, so he wouldn&#39;t read one more comic strip, let alone <br/>
one more page, until he had at least one more Calvin & Hobbes book in the <br/>
house...Naturally, I see the beauty in this and have ordered a dozen more <br/>
books, some of which we now have piled up on the living room floor, waiting <br/>
their turn to be devoured by a happy young boy!<br/>
<br/>
THANKS for your &quot;Favorites&quot;  list regarding math, and the heads up regarding <br/>
The Complete Homelearning Source Book, by Rebecca Rupp.  That is not one <br/>
I&#39;ve come across, and it sounds wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
No time to preview this before I send it, so I hope I have expressed myself <br/>
in the way I&#39;ve intended...<br/>
<br/>
I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR FEEDBACK AND HELPFUL HINTS, JOYCE!  THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Peaceful Pauses,<br/>

&gt; &gt; So, we started unschooling in October of 2001, very loosely, I might<br/>
&gt; &gt; add<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;People often mistake the word unschooling for homeschooling. Unschooling is<br/>
&gt;actually a philosophy of homeschooling, which by it&#39;s very definition is<br/>
&gt;loose! You can&#39;t get much looser than unschooling ;-) It gets defined<br/>
&gt;(rather inadequately) as child-led learning, natural learning, interest<br/>
&gt;driven learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As a general rule unschoolers don&#39;t divide the world into subjects. There&#39;s<br/>
&gt;just life :-) Though sometimes we share resources it may not be as much as<br/>
&gt;you&#39;d like. We tend more towards discussing learning from life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; *** I AM INTERESTED IN ANY INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING<br/>
&gt; &gt; INTEREACTIVE SOFTWARE, BOOKS, WORKBOOKS, TUTOR/MENTOR GUIDES,<br/>
&gt; &gt; MANIPULATIVES, OR ANYTHING ELSE REGARDING NATURAL MATH. Any info<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024257277">Hi, Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
An earlier attempt to respond did not bear fruit - don&#39;t know what happened, <br/>
other than I lost internet connection.<br/>
<br/>
So glad you are also seeing positive emotional and behavioral changes in <br/>
your son.  Dylan becomes more and more glee-filled as time goes on, and if <br/>
I&#39;m not careful, I might actually let go of my concerns and be able to ride <br/>
the wave of unschooling unfettered by &quot;old school&quot;  training which I&#39;m still <br/>
shackled with.  I suppose, in a very real sense, I AM DECOMPRESSING MYSELF, <br/>
to a larger degree than is my son.<br/>
<br/>
Insofar as your son wishing to learn the Japanese language and computer <br/>
programming language, TERRIFIC!  Have you found any supportive resources for <br/>
these endeavors?  I have gathered a couple of resources regarding foreign <br/>
language, just in case my son shows an interest at some future date.  I&#39;ll <br/>
pass them along, if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what an unschool school is, but would be interested to hear about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
By the by, I burned the midnight oil the other night and landed a goldmine <br/>
(for us, at least)  in regards to the NATURAL MATH issue.  In case anyone <br/>
else is interested in checking it out, see <br/>
www.themathlab.com/natural/natural_.htm, and the previous one I&#39;d found is <br/>
www.naturalmath.com.  Can&#39;t tell you how many hours I spent searching, all <br/>
told, but it has been well worth the effort and energy expended.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

&gt;NATURAL MATH???<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, 17 Feb 2002 01:33:15 EST<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        You&#39;re story sounds like mine. My son (who&#39;s 10) started attending <br/>
&gt;an<br/>
&gt;unschool school in september and is still decompressing from public school.<br/>
&gt;He still has a hatred of anything academic, but he very much wants to learn<br/>
&gt;Japanese and any and all computer programming languages. He hates math too,<br/>
&gt;so the most I can get him to do is play games, but he is also responsible <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;budgeting his own lunch money for the month(His school is in a city<br/>
&gt;neighborhood so he goes out to eat or goes to a 7-11 almost every day)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        However, the fact that he has changed from being an angry, uptight,<br/>
&gt;worried little boy to a happy, thoughtful, curious , repsonsible and<br/>
&gt;self-confident 10 year old is amazing. Right now I don&#39;t care if he does <br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt;academics this year, I&#39;m glad that he has become this wonderful person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
