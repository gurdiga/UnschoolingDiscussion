&gt;Project Gutenberg is happy to be a finalist in the Stockholm<br/>
&gt;Challenge (http://www.challenge.stockholm.se).  On October 7-10, in<br/>
&gt;the city of Stockholm, Sweden, there will be events and festivities<br/>
&gt;culminating in an awards ceremony on October 10.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are seeking someone to attend these events to represent Project<br/>
&gt;Gutenberg, preferably someone who lives in Europe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are interested in this opportunity to represent Project<br/>
&gt;Gutenberg, please email hart@...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Requests For Assistance:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone here find a pre-1923 English edition of the Gilgamesh Epic?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are seeking a physical copy of the book RUR in Czech by Karel<br/>
&gt;Capek, published in 1920-1922.  These copies are hard to find, but<br/>
&gt;available at the U. Nebraska Lincoln, Texas A&M, U. Texas Austin, NY<br/>
&gt;Public Library & Waseda University.  If you are near these and can<br/>
&gt;compare the eBook we have against the physical book, please contact<br/>
&gt;Greg Newby &lt;gbnewby@...&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Aaron Cannon is looking for any pre-1923 English/foreign Language<br/>
&gt;dictionaries that can be added to the archive.  He is especially interested<br/>
&gt;in English/Spanish Spanish/English dictionaries, but any language is<br/>
&gt;acceptable.  If you have any of these lying about, or if you know where<br/>
&gt;they can be had for less than $20, please contact Aaron at<br/>
&gt;cannona@...<br/>

&gt;The Distributed Proofreading Team is proud to annouce that they have<br/>
&gt;now completed over 400 e-texts! Stop on by and give us a hand with<br/>
&gt;the next 400! http://charlz.dns2go.com/gutenberg<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We currently also have eBooks needing proofing in German and Spanish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Project Gutenberg has a new way to prepare digital editions of books<br/>
&gt;which can not be read on a conventional flat bed scanner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brewster Kahle has generously donated time on The Internet Archive&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(http://www.archive.org)  Minolta 7100 orbital scanner<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;http://bpg.minoltausa.com 02<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While its physical location in San Francisco at the Presidio effectively<br/>
&gt;limits access to people local to the area, we can offer a limited<br/>
&gt;scanning service. Ideal candidate projects would be large format (up to<br/>
&gt;17&quot; by 23&quot;),  fragile or rare books which cannot be unbound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Specifically, when scanned, the book is opened to lay flat on its spine,<br/>
&gt;and is well supported on 2 variable height platens, producing a level<br/>
&gt;surface upon which the overhead scanhead focuses. Pages can be scanned<br/>
&gt;singly or in tandem, with resolution ranging from 300-600 dpi, depending<br/>
&gt;upon the size of the scan area. (400 is the max resolution at max size).<br/>
&gt;The correction software for eliminating center lines and curved pages is<br/>
&gt;outstanding. While not as fast as a sheet feeder, it is physically less<br/>
&gt;demanding to use than a flat bed scanner, and of course is much kinder to<br/>
&gt;delicate pages and bindings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Contact me if this sounds like something you can use!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;I have some copyright research for McNees, but no email address.<br/>

&gt;A new mailing list &quot;gut-tv@...&quot; has been added.<br/>
&gt;This mailing list is intended for those interested in helping or<br/>
&gt;monitoring the progress of a public access cable TV show &quot;Free<br/>
&gt;eBooks This Week&quot; which highlights the free eBooks posted in the<br/>
&gt;past week.  Those interested in helping could offer to help<br/>
&gt;write, help find interviews, be interviewed, and those local to<br/>
&gt;Maryland can help in the filming, staging, etc.  Please subscribe<br/>
&gt;to this mailing list if you are interested in being up to date on<br/>
&gt;all the TV goings on!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gutenberg Music expands offerings to include MusicXML<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In response to user requests for a non-proprietary - and preferably<br/>
&gt;text-based - music format and equally significant developments<br/>
&gt;in the music software industry, Project Gutenberg is pleased to<br/>
&gt;announce that all music titles are now available in MusicXML format.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While still a relatively new standard, MusicXML has gained broad<br/>
&gt;based support, and clearly responds to a well understood need for<br/>
&gt;music software to interoperate. The evolving standard economically<br/>
&gt;and unambiguously encodes all notes, rhythms, articulations, and<br/>
&gt;expression commonly used in classic period music. It also enables<br/>
&gt;the extraction of a basic MIDI performance automatically. Extensive<br/>
&gt;details about MusicXML and its adoption are available from<br/>
&gt;http://www.recordare.com/xml.html.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As with the main project, any Public Domain works are fair game for Music,<br/>
&gt;but we are specifically trying to complete the Beethoven String Quartets as<br/>
&gt;a first major series too. If you&#39;d be interested in a unique outlet for your<br/>
&gt;love of music (and perhaps dormant expertise ?), please contact Geof Pawlicki<br/>
&gt;(gpawlicki@...) or check out the volunteer pages at<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/music for further information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your interest !<br/>

&gt;http://www.promo.net/pg/list.html can get you to the nearest one.<br/>

&gt;world for the next week or three. . .so this is more important than usual.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;Use your Web browser or FTP program to visit our master download<br/>
&gt;site (or a mirror) if you know the filename you want.  Try:<br/>

&gt;PGofOz was started in August 2001 by Colin Choat, so it has taken<br/>
&gt;just over a year to create their first 100 eBooks.  [It took the<br/>
&gt;first Project Gutenberg about 23 years to reach 100.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don Lainson has contributed 30 ebooks to PGofOz as well as many to PG.<br/>
&gt;He lives in Canada. Sue Asscher of Australia has also been quite involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Our HUGE congratulations and thanks to each and every PGofOz volunteer!!!<br/>

&gt;Henry Handel Richardson (Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson) was born in<br/>
&gt;1870 in Melbourne, Victoria. She was born in a prosperous family which<br/>
&gt;later fell on hard times. Her family lived in various towns in Victoria<br/>
&gt;during her childhood and youth and she attended Presbyterian Ladies<br/>
&gt;College between the ages of 13 and 17. (This experience was the basis<br/>
&gt;for her novel The Getting of Wisdom.) She excelled at music during her<br/>
&gt;time at PLC and her mother took the family (her father having died in<br/>
&gt;1879) to Europe to enable Ethel to continue her musical studies at Leipzig.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ethel married J.G. Robertson in 1894 and later moved to London in 1903<br/>
&gt;where her husband has been appointed to a chair of German at the<br/>
&gt;University of London. She visited Australia again in 1912 for several<br/>
&gt;months before returning to England where she lived for the rest of her life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ethel Richardson died in 1946.<br/>

&gt;Statistical Review<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the 38 weeks of this year, we have produced 1,718 new eBooks.<br/>
&gt;Note: it took us from 1971 to 1998 to produce our *FIRST* 1,718 eBooks!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              That&#39;s 38 WEEKS as Compared to 28 YEARS!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The production statistics are calculated based on full weeks of<br/>
&gt;production, each production-week starting/ending Wednesday noon,<br/>
&gt;starting with the first Wednesday in January.  January 2nd was<br/>
&gt;was the first Wednesday of 2002, and thus ended the production<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With 6,015 eTexts online as of September 25, 2002 it now takes an average<br/>
&gt;of 100,000,000 readers gaining a nominal value of $1.66 from each book,<br/>
&gt;for Project Gutenberg to have currently given away $1,000,000,000,000<br/>
&gt;[One Trillion Dollars] in books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;100,000,000 readers is only about 1.59 percent of the world&#39;s population!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This &quot;cost&quot; is down from $2.55 when we had 3896 Etexts A Year Ago<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing $.89 less a year later???<br/>
&gt;Or. . .would this say it better?<br/>
&gt;Can you imagine 6,000 books each costing 1/3 less a year later???<br/>

&gt;CONGRESS PUSHES TO SWITCH ON DIGITAL TV<br/>
&gt;Draft legislation proposed by Reps. W.J. &quot;Billy&quot; Tauzin (R-La.) and John<br/>
&gt;Dingell (D-Mich.) would force broadcasters to stop sending analog TV<br/>
&gt;signals by the end of 2006, rendering most TVs obsolete by 2007. The<br/>
&gt;Tauzin-Dingall draft, which Congressional staffers hastened to call a<br/>
&gt;&quot;starting point,&quot; sparked a firestorm of protest from broadcasters and<br/>
&gt;consumer groups. The move is aimed at stepping up the pace of the<br/>
&gt;switchover from analog to digital TV that was legislated back in 1996.<br/>
&gt;Under current law, TV stations may continue using airwaves earmarked for<br/>
&gt;analog signals until 85% of U.S. households in their markets own digital TV<br/>
&gt;sets, but sales have been extremely slow, hampered by high prices and<br/>
&gt;limited digital programming. The proposed legislation also requires the FCC<br/>
&gt;to settle a dispute between the entertainment industry and technology firms<br/>
&gt;over how best to implement copy-protection technology, known as a broadcast<br/>
&gt;flag, designed to prevent digital over-the-air TV shows from being copied<br/>
&gt;and redistributed via the Internet. A hearing is set for next week. (Los<br/>
&gt;Angeles Times 20 Sep 2002)<br/>

&gt;WEBCASTERS LOBBY AGAINST ROYALTY ASSESSMENTS<br/>
&gt;Internet-radio proponents swarmed Capitol Hill Thursday to urge Congress to<br/>
&gt;delay or lower the royalties they will have to begin paying record labels<br/>
&gt;beginning Oct. 20. The webcasters have argued that the rates are too high<br/>
&gt;for a new medium and are planning to appeal the rate of 0.07 cent per song<br/>
&gt;per listener, which was set last June by the Librarian of Congress. The<br/>
&gt;music companies are also appealing the rates, which they say are too low.<br/>
&gt;The two groups are engaged in discussions in an effort to head off dueling<br/>
&gt;lawsuits, but so far the talks have not produced a settlement. Some<br/>
&gt;Internet radio firms and broadcasters have already shut down their<br/>
&gt;webcasting operations, at least in part because of the upcoming royalty<br/>
&gt;payment. &quot;It was purely an economic decision,&quot; says the CEO of<br/>
&gt;Jefferson-Pilot Corp.&#39;s radio operations, which has stopped streaming 15 of<br/>
&gt;its 17 stations online because of the fees. (Wall Street Journal 20 Sep 2002)<br/>

&gt;DOES REAL ESTATE INFO WANT TO BE FREE?<br/>
&gt;In its convention this fall, the National Association of Realtors (the<br/>
&gt;country&#39;s No. 1 real estate trade association) will be considering a new<br/>
&gt;rule that will let brokers withhold property information from Internet<br/>
&gt;sites that give access to multiple listing services. Proponents of the rule<br/>
&gt;say that such data is valuable information and that it belongs to the<br/>
&gt;brokers who assemble and manage, while opponents say that brokers should<br/>
&gt;see themselves as deal managers rather than as information gate-keepers.<br/>
&gt;NAR general counsel Laurie Janik says that a multiple listing service &quot;is a<br/>
&gt;broker-to-broker tool. It&#39;s never been open to the consumer.&quot;<br/>

&gt;BAN ON CALIFORNIA SPAMMIN&#39;<br/>
&gt;A new California law that will take effect in January bans the unsolicited<br/>
&gt;sending of text messages to cell phones. The bill&#39;s author, Assemblyman Tim<br/>
&gt;Leslie (R, Tahoe City), says the bill is intended to stop spam text<br/>
&gt;messages from getting as out of control as spam e-mail messages. The bill<br/>
&gt;is part of a package (called &quot;leave-us-alone-legislation), which also bans<br/>
&gt;unsolicited fax ads and which makes changes to California&#39;s &quot;do-not-call&quot;<br/>
&gt;list for telemarketers. (AP/USA Today 23 Sep 2002)<br/>

&gt;CALIFORNIA TRIES TO PREEMPT CELL PHONE MARKETERS<br/>
&gt;California&#39;s Governor Gray Davis this week signed into law a measure<br/>
&gt;that will prevent marketing companies from sending unwanted<br/>
&gt;advertisements and solicitations to mobile phones and pagers. The bill<br/>
&gt;was proposed by Assemblyman Tim Leslie. Davis said he supported the<br/>
&gt;measure because he wanted to prevent an explosion of spam to mobile<br/>
&gt;devices similar to what has happened with personal computers. The<br/>
&gt;mobile phone spam bill will go into effect in January. Davis also<br/>
&gt;signed into law two other privacy bills, one that places stricter<br/>
&gt;limits on junk faxes and another to facilitate the creation of a<br/>
&gt;statewide &quot;do not call&quot; list.<br/>

&gt;TAUZIN PROPOSES DEADLINE FOR DIGITAL TV<br/>
&gt;Billy Tauzin (R-La.) has proposed requiring television broadcasters to<br/>
&gt;switch completely to digital signal transmissions by early 2006 and end<br/>
&gt;analog transmissions by the end of that year. Members of the television<br/>
&gt;industry, including broadcasters and makers of electronic equipment,<br/>
&gt;have been slow to agree on a plan to make the transition to digital<br/>
&gt;signals, and Tauzin thinks it&#39;s time for regulators to step in. He<br/>
&gt;said, &quot;While we prefer marketplace solutions, clearly it&#39;s time for us<br/>
&gt;to provide leadership in this area.&quot; Under Tauzin&#39;s proposal, the<br/>
&gt;Federal Communications Commission would establish technical standards<br/>
&gt;with which broadcasters and equipment makers would have to comply. At<br/>
&gt;least one consumer group criticized the proposal as too heavy-handed,<br/>
&gt;stifling innovation and fair use. A spokesman for Tauzin said it was<br/>
&gt;not clear yet if or when the proposal would be offered as a bill.<br/>

&gt;NO COMPROMISE ON DVD STANDARD<br/>
&gt;Two industry groups supporting conflicting standards for rewritable<br/>
&gt;DVDs have apparently given up on resolving their differences and<br/>
&gt;settling on a single standard. The DVD+RW Alliance and the DVD Forum<br/>
&gt;support different formats, and there are at least four types of discs,<br/>
&gt;causing headaches for consumers and device manufacturers. The result is<br/>
&gt;an alphabet soup of formats and media that consumers must keep<br/>
&gt;straight: DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, DVD+R. Observers note that<br/>
&gt;the market for rewritable DVDs depends largely on resolving the<br/>
&gt;conflicting standards, making the discs and the formats fully<br/>
&gt;compatible on PCs as well as home and portable DVD devices. Sony<br/>
&gt;reportedly will release new drives that work with different formats,<br/>
&gt;but pressure from companies including Intel may eventually push the two<br/>
&gt;DVD organizations to find a compromise.<br/>

&gt;BREAKING THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ON A BUDGET<br/>
&gt;Researchers at Middle Tennessee State University have created a device<br/>
&gt;that can send electric signals at four times the speed of light, and<br/>
&gt;they did so with commonly available components costing $500. This is<br/>
&gt;not the first time electric signals have exceeded the speed of light,<br/>
&gt;but it is the first time it&#39;s been done without extremely expensive<br/>
&gt;equipment. The device, which one researcher was able to assemble from<br/>
&gt;parts in just 40 minutes, can create a pulse of energy that, measured<br/>
&gt;by an oscilloscope, moves at 4 billion kilometers per hour. Bill<br/>
&gt;Robertson, one of the researchers, hopes that students and other<br/>
&gt;researchers can use the device to cheaply test some of the basic<br/>
&gt;theories of modern science.<br/>
