<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear group, Last night I had a moment with my son, 
that was very touching.&nbsp; As I was working on the computer, my son who was 
not yet asleep, walks in , crawls into my lap, with little tears in his eyes and 
says&quot; Mommy, will you die before me?&quot;&nbsp; I said &quot;yes honey, but my spirit 
will always be with you&quot;&nbsp; , I could see this was not as comfoting as I 
would have liked..&quot;but I wanna die before you do&quot;..Oh No don&#39;t say that 
honey...I&#39;m older than you ..it is likely that I will pass on before you will, 
caus ei was born befor you&quot;&nbsp; SO Pop will die before you?&nbsp; Well I don&#39;t 
know...I hope not...When will you die?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t know, honey,we don&#39;t 
really know before, but if I do die befor you...I will stay with you..my 
spirit....&quot;will you look like this body?&nbsp; if you like...I think you will 
imagine me as you want to, but this won&#39;t be for a long time...&quot;Can&#39;t we just go 
together??&quot; &quot;and pop, too&quot;????&nbsp; I don&#39;t know....but our Love will always 
keep us together in SPirit.....I know we&#39;ve discussed this thread onlist before, 
and I am not the type of person to encourage the &quot;fear&quot; of death...I want him to 
understand our belief is that our spirit lives forever, and that death is just a 
movement from this life to another level of consciousness.&nbsp; But I noticed 
when I was typing up there...that when I became....well when I said...&quot;Oh no 
don&#39;t say that&quot;.....I was also very fearful, because the thought of him dieing 
fbefor me, and as well my husband..is very scary....For some weird reason&nbsp; 
I find it easier to accept my own death, and be comfortable, that the time will 
come, and I will just go, and not to fear that, because after all it is a part 
of this life ..but to think of living here, after knowing such a love...and not 
having them here to experience this life with....would make for....I don&#39;t 
know...a pretty dull sad, and awful experience.....I would never want to be 
without them, and this is not the first time I have pondered this.....sometimes 
when my husband comes home late I begin to worry that something may have 
happened....now not all the time mind you....but it is a fearDoes anyone else 
have any feelings on this?&nbsp; Many Blessings, Michelle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P. 
S. I would feel somewhat violated if people could access totally personal 
feelingsa such as these , on a search engine...after all this is somewhat of a 
support group, and in these type sof groups it is in the spirit of the groups to 
assume soem degree of confidentiality.&nbsp; wouldn&#39;t you think?&nbsp; Not that 
it matters what someone might think that reads this, but it is rather 
personal..I should be able to choose to whom, I &#39;d like to share it 
with.</font></div></html></div>
