<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Brenda,<br/>
&gt; I have a question.  Do you think that is because of the environment?  The<br/>
&gt; military atmosphere?  You are probably the only unschooler and probably one of<br/>
&gt; the only homeschoolers there.  I remember when we were in Germany, my boys<br/>
&gt; were both toddlers then, but I knew no homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably the environment.  Probably it&#39;s also living in a country where<br/>
homeschooling isn&#39;t allowed, so I answer a lot of very basic questions about<br/>
it ALL the time.  And I just left visiting both sets of grandparents,<br/>
neither of whom entirely &quot;get it&quot;.  So I&#39;m feeling vastly out of step these<br/>
days.  <br/>

before the conference.  I can not wait!<br/>
