CBS Needs Education on Homeschooling, Say Advocates<br/>
By Marc Morano<br/>
CNSNews.com Senior Staff Writer<br/>
October 16, 2003<br/>
<br/>
(CNSNews.com) - Homeschooling advocates are accusing CBS<br/>
News of trying to damage their reputation with a two-part report<br/>
focusing on the &quot;dark side&quot; of the &quot;largely unregulated&quot;<br/>
homeschool movement. The reports aired Monday and Tuesday<br/>
nights.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Those who may be opposed to home education are digging<br/>
around the bottom of the barrel, looking for marginal cases,<br/>
families who have troubles that far exceed any educational<br/>
question,&quot; said Hal Young, president of North Carolinians for<br/>
Home Education.<br/>
<br/>
Young was the only person in the Eye on America segments<br/>
who defended the practice of homeschooling.<br/>
According to the CBS reports, the practice of educating children<br/>
at home carries with it the risk that children will be abused or<br/>
even &quot;killed while homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While previewing the Eye on America investigation during CBS&#39;s<br/>
The Early Show Monday morning, Rather said the following:<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling has produced some brilliant young minds, but<br/>
there is a dark side to the movement that can put some<br/>
children&#39;s lives at risk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An estimated 850,000 children are being homeschooled in the<br/>
U.S., about 2 percent of the nation&#39;s total number of school-aged<br/>
children, according to CBS.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, CBS News correspondent Vince Gonzales<br/>
previewed the following day&#39;s segment by saying: &quot;Tomorrow,<br/>
how children nationwide have been put in danger, even killed<br/>
while homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The two-part report included several examples of parents who<br/>
had &quot;taught their children at home&quot; but who had ended up<br/>
abusing and killing the children. Texas mother Andrea Yates,<br/>
who drowned her five children in a bathtub, was listed as one of<br/>
the examples. The series concluded by noting that no states<br/>
require &quot;criminal background checks&quot; of the parents who<br/>
homeschool their children.<br/>
But homeschooling advocates like Young are crying foul.<br/>
&quot;It was plain from the tone of [CBS News&#39;] interview with me that<br/>
they had already made up their mind how the story was going to<br/>
spin out, and they were simply fishing for sound bites in the<br/>
questions that they were asking,&quot; Young told CNSNews.com.<br/>
In Monday&#39;s first part, correspondent Gonzales reported on the<br/>
double murder, suicide involving two teenage children killed by<br/>
their brother, who subsequently took his own life in Johnston<br/>
County, N.C. The CBS News report noted that the three children<br/>
had all been homeschooled and were outside the observation of<br/>
the county and state educational systems.<br/>
<br/>
But J. Michael Smith, president of the Virginia-based Home<br/>
School Legal Defense Association, said CBS News left out key<br/>
aspects of the family tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
The CBS report did include one reference to how the parents of<br/>
the North Carolina children had tried to prevent social workers<br/>
from visiting their youngsters, but Smith said, &quot;missing from the<br/>
CBS story was that [North Carolina State] Social Services had<br/>
contacted the family 11 times, were well aware of the condition of<br/>
the home and had been working with the family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
According to Smith, &quot;any fair-minded&quot; viewer of the broadcast<br/>
would have been left with the impression &quot;that homeschooling<br/>
equals child abuse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first of the CBS reports, Smith said, was a &quot;shameless<br/>
attempt to smear an entire community of committed, dedicated<br/>
parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are outraged that CBS would ignore the obvious facts and<br/>
draw the erroneous conclusion that homeschoolers need to be<br/>
strictly regulated,&quot; he added.<br/>
<br/>
The second segment on homeschooling concluded with CBS<br/>
News hinting that parents needed to be investigated for their<br/>
children to be adequately protected.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unlike teachers, in 38 states and the District of Columbia,<br/>
parents need virtually no qualifications to homeschool. Not one<br/>
state requires criminal background checks to see if parents have<br/>
abuse convictions,&quot; Gonzales said during the broadcast.<br/>
Young was surprised CBS would imply that parents needed to<br/>
get &quot;criminal background checks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That says that CBS feels all parents are suspect, and a criminal<br/>
background check would probably be in order,&quot; Young said. &quot;Not<br/>
just home educators, but all parents of preschoolers, parents of<br/>
children who are home for summer vacation,&quot; he added.<br/>
Young also questioned CBS&#39;s motives for criticizing the lack of<br/>
state mandated criminal background checks for parents.<br/>
&quot;Do they have an agenda that families should be presumed<br/>
dysfunctional and in need of government intervention in the<br/>
raising of their own children?&quot; Young asked.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Out of the public eye&#39;<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of Tuesday&#39;s second segment, Rather<br/>
conceded that the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of parents who<br/>
homeschool &quot;have only the best interests of their children at<br/>
heart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then, Rather introduced Gonzales&#39;s report by telling his<br/>
audience: &quot;A CBS News investigation found dozens of cases of<br/>
parents convicted or accused of murder or child abuse who were<br/>
teaching their children at home, out of the public eye.&quot;<br/>
Gonzales then profiled several cases nationwide in which<br/>
homeschooled children had been allegedly killed by their<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Andrea Yates gained national attention when she drowned her<br/>
five children in a bathtub. Deanna Laney told investigators she<br/>
beat her three sons with rocks, killing two of them. Both mothers<br/>
taught their children at home,&quot; Gonzales said in the report<br/>
broadcast Tuesday evening.<br/>
<br/>
Gonzales also found the &quot;private dark side&quot; in the education of a<br/>
National Spelling Bee participant.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Marjorie Lavery says her father beat her before the National<br/>
Spelling Bee, then threatened to kill her after she came in<br/>
second. He pleaded guilty to child endangerment after she<br/>
testified about years of cruelty,&quot; Gonzales explained on the air.<br/>
Ian M. Slatter, the director of media relations at the Home School<br/>
Legal Defense Association, said the CBS News reports were<br/>
completely off base.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They profiled some very troubling cases, [that] while tragic, did<br/>
not have anything to do with homeschooling. Homeschooling<br/>
was not the cause of the tragedies,&quot; Slatter told CNSNews.com.<br/>
&quot;We definitely believe for CBS to broadcast this story, [the<br/>
network] displays a bias against homeschooling,&quot; Slatter added.<br/>
CBS News Publicist Andie Silvers released a network statement<br/>
on the criticism from homeschooling advocates.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These reports examined a group of people who are using<br/>
homeschooling as an excuse to hide the physical abuse they<br/>
inflict on their children, a disturbing reality in this country,&quot; the<br/>
CBS statement read. &quot;CBS News clearly reported that the<br/>
majority of parents who homeschool their kids are doing a fine<br/>
job of teaching and raising their children.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Smearing homeschoolers&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the Media Research<br/>
Center, the parent organization of CNSNews.com, said CBS<br/>
News was attempting to discredit the whole homeschool<br/>
movement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;CBS is doing two things wrong here. First, it&#39;s smearing<br/>
homeschoolers by association with child-killers like Andrea<br/>
Yates and perpetuating a stereotype that homeschoolers are<br/>
dangerous parents,&quot; Graham said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Second, it&#39;s producing a heavy-handed advertisement for more<br/>
regulation, insisting that only more government bureaucrats can<br/>
prevent child homicides and suggesting that public schools are<br/>
a much safer option,&quot; Graham added.<br/>
<br/>
Despite CBS&#39;s negative portrayal of homeschooling, the practice<br/>
has defenders in high places.<br/>
<br/>
Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, and a senior<br/>
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told<br/>
CNSNews.com last April that homeschooling was a viable<br/>
solution to poor public schools.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think homeschooling is one of the greatly to be admired<br/>
phenomena of our times. Families who have undertaken it have<br/>
produced some kids who know a remarkable amount and<br/>
perform remarkably well,&quot; Cheney said.</div>

<br/>
Is the government considering preventing criminals from having children?<br/>
<br/>
That would be different.<br/>
