<div id="ygrps-yiv-392023558">At our local HS/school store, they have these posters that are blck and white <br/>
printed with questions about a topic (I think they have All about Me, States, <br/>
similar titles) places to draw pictures, timelines, It&#39;s really pretty <br/>
interesting!<br/>
Check and see if there is something like that that she would enjoy.<br/>
