OLYMPIC SHOWTIME: Despite scattered protests, Sydney Olympics organizers<br/>
   have refused to back down from their plan to use drag queens in the<br/>
   Games&#39; closing ceremony. The cross-dressers, perhaps accompanied by<br/>
   &quot;Muscle Marys&quot;, will appear on a float commemorating Australian cinema,<br/>
   in this case the 1995 movie &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the<br/>
   Desert&quot;, which features a band of transvestites trekking through the<br/>
   Australian Outback. Local newspapers are supporting the plan, noting<br/>
   that cross-dressing is &quot;a part of the nation&#39;s art culture.&quot; Closing<br/>
   ceremony director Ric Birch dismissed the anti-gay protests, noting<br/>
   &quot;This element of the show is only a tiny part of a huge celebration.<br/>
   [As] for the right wing reactionaries, ...they&#39;re always going to be<br/>
   outraged.&quot; Other floats in the closing ceremony parade will commemorate<br/>
   other Australian movies, such as Crocodile Dundee and Mad Max.<br/>
   (Reuters) ...Which will surely trigger protests by animal rights and<br/>
   anti-violence advocates.<br/>
<br/>
OLYMPIC MEMORIES: The medal design for Sydney&#39;s winning athletes does not<br/>
   depict a classic Greek stadium, but rather the Coliseum in Rome. While<br/>
   Olympic officials deny that the stadium shown is the Coliseum, Wojciech<br/>
   Pietranik, who designed the medals, admits the design is indeed based<br/>
   on the Coliseum. He said he really wanted to depict &quot;Nike, the Goddess<br/>
   of Victory, visiting Sydney,&quot; as represented by the city&#39;s famous Opera<br/>
   House, but the International Olympic Committee vetoed that idea and<br/>
   ordered the design reflect the 1928 medal by Italian sculptor Guiseppe<br/>
   Cassioli, which was also based on the Coliseum. (Reuters) ...Of course<br/>
   the IOC rejected Nike -- she was depicted as a Swoosh.<br/>

OLYMPIC FEARS: Sydney Olympic officials scoff over worries that triathlon<br/>
   competitors might be bitten by sharks during their swim in Sydney<br/>
   harbor. &quot;There&#39;s more chance of a triathlete being hit by lightning or<br/>
   stung by a bee than bitten by a shark,&quot; argues competition manager<br/>
   David Hansen. But to keep athletes from being &quot;concerned&quot; over recent<br/>
   sightings of sharks in the harbor, divers armed with electric shark<br/>
   repellant systems have been hired to drive motorized scooters under the<br/>
   swimmers to shoo away any pesky man-eaters. Experts say the divers will<br/>
   feel an electrical &quot;tingle&quot;, but the athletes above them won&#39;t feel a<br/>
   thing. (Reuters) ...Though if they do, they&#39;re likely to record their<br/>
   best times ever.<br/>
<br/>
OLYMPIC EXPECTATIONS: Every athlete competing in the Sydney Olympics will<br/>
   get an allotment of 51 condoms in their welcome package. Assuming they<br/>
   stay all 17 days, that gives each three condoms per day. (Reuters)<br/>
   ...&quot;Hope springs eternal in the human breast / Man never is, but always<br/>
   to be blest / The soul, uneasy, and confin&#39;d from home / Rests and<br/>
   expatiates in a life to come.&quot; --Alexander Pope (Essay on Man, 1733).<br/>

   Jimmy in Indiana writes, &quot;Love your publication and I hope that you<br/>
   never grow tired of producing it. If your other subscribers are like me<br/>
   they&#39;ll never grow tired of it, and as long as there is an ample supply<br/>
   of fools & madmen you&#39;ll never run out of material.&quot; I&#39;m indeed not<br/>
   worried about running out of material. I&#39;ve never had a shortage of<br/>
   things to write about, and I&#39;m enjoying doing it as much as ever. Yung<br/>
   in Texas: &quot;I found your site by accident awhile back and have been<br/>
   subscribed to your free feed for some time now. I just wanted to say<br/>
   how much I enjoy reading what you have to say at the end of each<br/>
   article. They&#39;re just priceless!! A lot of the time, I just have to<br/>
   forward them on to my friends because your comments are just too good<br/>
   to keep to myself.&quot; I&#39;m glad you like them, and indeed the way TRUE<br/>
   grows is when you forward issues to your friends with a note telling<br/>
   them they can get their own subscriptions, for free of course! See the<br/>
   copyright notice at the end for details on that. I really appreciate it<br/>
   when you recommend TRUE to your friends.<br/>

ALAS, BRYANT IN KANSAS, responding to a couple of recent stories that<br/>
   touched on religion, says: &quot;I&#39;ve grown weary of your newsletter, and<br/>
   your anti-Christian bent. I always wonder why anything &#39;Christian&#39; gets<br/>
   blasted and not any other religion? Don&#39;t tell me that it&#39;s because<br/>
   Christians are so narrow minded. I won&#39;t buy into that one.&quot; Bryant,<br/>
   Christians, as a whole, aren&#39;t narrow-minded, so it must just be you.<br/>
   It does blow me away when I write about one religion&#39;s dumb doings<br/>
   (such as a recent article about Muslim men being counseled to beat<br/>
   their women &quot;gently&quot;) and THAT&#39;s &quot;funny&quot; to fundamental Christians, but<br/>
   when I write another article about Christians doing something stupid,<br/>
   suddenly you forget about those earlier stories and accuse me of being<br/>
   &quot;anti-Christian&quot;. Of course I&#39;m not &quot;anti-Christian&quot;, Bryant, I&#39;m anti-<br/>
   idiot and anti-hypocrite. If that bothers you, it only makes me wonder<br/>
   which one of those YOU are. And if others wonder what kind of story set<br/>
   Bryant off, please spend a few minutes reading my passionate arguments<br/>
   at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thisistrue.com/rfree.html">http://www.thisistrue.com/rfree.html</a> for TRUE religious freedom --<br/>
   and tell me if you think that makes me &quot;anti&quot; any religion.<br/>
<br/>
REGARDING THE &quot;STORIES YOU MISSED&quot; in the Premium issue (below), and<br/>
   speaking of some fundamentalists feeling threatened, I am very well<br/>
   aware that there is an urban legend running wild online about J.K.<br/>
   Rowling, author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, so do NOT send it to me.<br/>
   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa080900a.htm">http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/weekly/aa080900a.htm</a> will, I<br/>
   hope, put your mind at rest if you&#39;ve been worried about it. (I&#39;ve<br/>
   indeed been getting copies of the laughable charges; the ironic part is<br/>
   their &quot;proof&quot; is a newspaper article -- in The Onion! If you aren&#39;t<br/>
   familiar with The Onion, it&#39;s a parody newspaper which runs both online<br/>
   and in print, so it&#39;s a bit ironic that people are taking it seriously.<br/>
   Of course, the people getting hysterical about it aren&#39;t spending any<br/>
   time *thinking* about the issue, or *reviewing* the source &quot;evidence&quot;.<br/>
   Just like most hoaxes online, eh?)<br/>

THIS WEEK&#39;S HONORARY UNSUBSCRIBE goes to John H. Renner. A clinical<br/>
   professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Medical School, Dr.<br/>
   Renner was also the president of the National Council for Reliable<br/>
   Health Information, where he spent countless hours surfing health sites<br/>
   on the Internet and rating them for accuracy. &quot;The Internet is a useful<br/>
   tool for consumers to find health information,&quot; he told the New York<br/>
   Academy of Medicine this summer. &quot;However, we must constantly arm<br/>
   ourselves with discretion in determining whether the information is<br/>
   trustworthy. You have to know how to navigate around the quackery and<br/>
   questionable claims of cures.&quot; On September 2, he called 911 because of<br/>
   chest pain, and died later that day after emergency heart surgery. He<br/>
   was 67.<br/>
