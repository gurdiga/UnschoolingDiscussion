 </span></blockquote>hi,<br/>
<br/>
i guess i feel that that will happen when they are grown and are sick of me &lt;g&gt;<br/>
i get moments here and there but because of my illness i had to be away for<br/>
stretches (10 day hospital stay, 10 days & 21 days at treatment centers) and i<br/>
hated it,  so i&#39;m happy not spending time away.  i love being left alone, i<br/>
like the peace and quiet while most people i&#39;ve met fill their days with<br/>
activity i lean toward a slow paced life.  my whole life i preferred staying<br/>
home (even as a teenager:) and i don&#39;t join in on many excursion.  i really<br/>
love hanging with my kid but i have just one so it&#39;s not as full as carol&#39;s day<br/>
is with 7.   part of the problem i see is that our society pushes us to define<br/>
ourselves as something - the question: what do you do?  is never felt to be<br/>
truly answered if you say i&#39;m a mom.   immediately you&#39;re judged as a follower,<br/>
less intelligent, as someone who has nothing of interested to contribute.  it&#39;s<br/>
sad really but the choice remains and the judgments are theirs not yours, as<br/>
loud and distracting as those judgments are.<br/>
<br/>
i heard someone say:  &#39;you can have it all just not all at the same time&#39;.  you<br/>
will get your time alone after the kids have moved onto a different phase of<br/>
life.  i guess in short its a lifestyle of togetherness - a state of mind that<br/>
this is just right,  this state of interdependence (my personal definition of<br/>
family).  so why push them to be independent now when we know they will get<br/>
there one day especially if we respect and honor where they&#39;re at right now.<br/>
personally i relish this lifestyle and wish more people would deeply enjoy<br/>
their time with their kids.   i wouldn&#39;t want to be separated from my kid<br/>
unless that&#39;s what he would want but i&#39;m sure we will always be very close.<br/>
<br/>
i know i&#39;ve gone off on a tangent and this was not exactly what you were asking<br/>
but at the same time a shift in perspective does give you the ability to not be<br/>
drained so quickly because it removes a lot of the doubts and desires which are<br/>
in conflict this those of the family & kids.  imo when your lifestyle naturally<br/>
makes you happy then you are naturally recharged.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169040424">Annette, you raise some good questions... I suspect you and everyone else has <br/>
found or will find the answers in the continual quest for balance.  This will <br/>
come with time and experience, I am sure.  But as others have expressed, this <br/>
will be a &quot;dance&quot; that will continue to change as time goes by.  Some days I <br/>
find more time for me, or things like taking care of household chores, <br/>
sometimes there seems to be very little time; and then, again, there do seem <br/>
to be &quot;windows&quot; of time during the average day where things slow down, and <br/>
then I choose to do something that I want or need to do.  Also, I think it&#39;s <br/>
important to include the kids in household tasks, when possible, so that the <br/>
parents don&#39;t shoulder the entire burden.  I like to talk with my kids and <br/>
get  their ideas of what they want to do during the day, then we  try  to <br/>
plan a schedule --not rigidly-- but enough of  a plan so that they can see <br/>
that my needs ( which may include sewing, painting, or cleaning, etc...)  are <br/>
also going to be included in the mix.  Of course, like anything, there are <br/>
days where it runs smoothly, and other days  where I wonder what day of the <br/>
week it is , and it is already 11:00am and I am not dressed...  But I need <br/>
time too, we all do; not only for ourselves and our sense of peace, but also <br/>
because we are better parents to our kids when we get some peace and quiet <br/>
all to ourselves.  I find that I am more patient with my kids if I can have a <br/>
little time for me, &lt;like spending some time on the computer :) &gt;.  Have a <br/>
great day!                                                                      <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437791269">Hi Annette and all-<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But <br/>
 looking through the schedule, I see that early in the morning you have half <br/>
 an hour to exercise (with kids nearby) and then you don&#39;t get any time alone <br/>
 again til 10 pm, when you can take a bath and read. That is a long day!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are an astute woman!  This is very much a continuing problem here-how <br/>
does Mom recharge?  Plus, my dh commutes 2 hours per day, six days a week, on <br/>
top of working 12 hour days and 8 on Saturdays. <br/>
We are in the process of re-evaluating jobs, home location, etc.  But, for <br/>
right now, his job is a grand one that supports all of us and to move closer <br/>
to the job would increase our expenditures for housing (it&#39;s near Chicago).<br/>
<br/>
I guess all I can say to this query is that my life is a work in progress.  <br/>
We&#39;re trying to work together to meet all of our needs.  The day I wrote <br/>
about online, to tell the truth, did wear me out.  Not all my days are quite <br/>
that hectic.<br/>
<br/>
The best way I&#39;ve found to recharge is simply to steal little moments to <br/>
myself.  Like now, for instance, my 3 older kids are gone, my 3 youngers are <br/>
playing in the basement and the baby is asleep.  So, I&#39;m foregoing the <br/>
housework and playing here instead.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I usually put the kids in bed early except the 3 older ones and <br/>
talk a walk for about 1/2 hour each evening.  That helps.<br/>
 <br/>
Often, in the evenings, my dh will supervise the kids while I go into the <br/>
bedroom and talk on the phone to my sister or a friend, or just read.<br/>
<br/>
I also have found it vital to keep some interests going outside the home, in <br/>
order to keep my perspective.  So, I write a newsletter for a drama group in <br/>
town and sometimes (though very rarely) I do freelance writing work.  This is <br/>
a mixed blessing, because sometimes I do not need one more responsibility.  <br/>
But, sometimes the diversion keeps me sane.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to get to the library once a week by myself and I read as much as <br/>
I can.  I also think it&#39;s important to keep up on what&#39;s going on in the <br/>
world, so I read a daily newspaper for entertainment.  My hubby and I also go <br/>
out with another couple for dinner at least once a month and usually manage a <br/>
dinner or lunch ourselves.  We often go for a drive on Sunday afternoons <br/>
after we&#39;ve hired a babysitter.  (during the little one&#39;s nap time)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a church going person, so I take time to pray, go visit the beautiful <br/>
quiet chapel in our community and talk to other mothers I see there.  I also <br/>
try to visit a couple of elderly people I know because they give me wonderful <br/>
insights!<br/>
<br/>
I used to belong to outside groups, but have cut back on those because they <br/>
really cut into time with my hubby.<br/>
  <br/>
I think about taking a class for intellectual stimulation, but haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
that far yet.<br/>
<br/>
But, yes, I must admit, most things take a back seat to the kids.  I know <br/>
this time is relatively short (although with 7 it doesn&#39;t seem that way!), <br/>
and situations are always changing.  My life is easier now than when I had <br/>
four children under 7 and no older kids.<br/>
<br/>
As far as cooking, housework, etc., I&#39;ve learned to take a really relaxed <br/>
approach here.  My house is not a big mess...but it wouldn&#39;t win contests for <br/>
Good Housekeeping either.  The truth is, I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time <br/>
cooking and cleaning.  They are not my priorities.  So, we stick with <br/>
simplicity.  We all do basic pick-up and feeding pets, etc. a couple of times <br/>
a day.  Then on Sat. a.m. the kids and I usually do some deeper cleaning.  <br/>
One of the kids helps with laundry each week and we try to do 2 loads a day.  <br/>
We stick with simple suppers and my dh is really good about helping when he <br/>
comes home from work.<br/>
It&#39;s not perfect, but it works for us mostly.  When it doesn&#39;t, we change it. <br/>
I know you&#39;ve heard it before-but it really is always a balancing act!<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to go on so.  Thanks for your questions and concern!<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a little spoiled. I only have a 9yodd and an 18modd. I sometimes <br/>
have my 5 and 10yo stepsons as well. I get time to myself every single day. <br/>
I&#39;m up about half an hour before the kids, so I try to get any major <br/>
housework done then, any other chores the girls can do with me. When dh gets <br/>
home from work, I get an hour to go workout. If I&#39;m really worn out, I go to <br/>
the bookstore for an hour or so after that. When the youngest is napping, dd <br/>
and I do some really quiet activity like drawing or reading, so I get to <br/>
recharge some then, too. I usually take the last 20 minutes of that nap time <br/>
and sit quietly and have a cup of coffee and something decadent. Can you <br/>
believe that with all that quiet time, I still get cranky sometimes?: :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338326854">Carol-  I had to laugh when you mentioned taking a class for<br/>
intellectual stimulation.<br/>
It occurred to me that all of the local colleges could offer<br/>
a class called &quot;Intellectual Stimulation for Mothers&quot; and<br/>
they would probably fill them to capacity!  I have weeks<br/>
where I am content to be at home and focus on my girls (3, 6<br/>
and 9) but every now and then I begin to come unglued.  My<br/>
husband can spot it immediately and calls by best friends to<br/>
come and rescue me from insanity!  Usually it means a trip<br/>
to the bookstore for a Raspberry Mocha and great<br/>
conversation.  Still the kids are on my mind and I end up<br/>
buying some books for them. With my husband traveling most<br/>
week nights and only seeing him on weekends, I usually spend<br/>
more time with the kids and require a bedtime of 9pm.  That<br/>
is to allow myself time to reflect on the day or get some<br/>
great projects completed.  no matter who you are or what you<br/>
do it is a  balancing act.<br/>

What a great hubby!  I&#39;ll have to try that the next time I come unglued.  The <br/>
last time I lost it I had just gone to one of those cheap hair places to get <br/>
my hair cut and I came home and cried because the stylist hadn&#39;t done it <br/>
right!  I haven&#39;t done that since 8th grade!  My dh knew right away that I <br/>
had gone over my limit and he went to the store, bought me a good novel, <br/>
tucked me in bed, brought me a cup of hot cocoa and I read myself to sleep.  <br/>
What a difference some sleep can make.<br/>

&gt;Carol from WI <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a great hubby and would never dream of complaining, he is such a jewel.  But sometimes I have to beat him over the head with a club to get him to see when I am falling apart.  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what happens when we do not raise young men to be intuitive, emotional, feeling and compassionate creatures.  I am raising my boys to be whole people, I hope.  My hubby&#39;s biggest complaint about his upbringing is how out of touch with his feelings and those of others he is and his inability and struggles to express himself and communicate.  This is I think in part due to his natural shyness, but also due to having his own father as an example, and his mom too for that matter.  I think they are two of the most uncommunicative people I have ever met, except for my folks, who have them beat hands down.  But his father was often absent and does not express tenderness well, or any of the &quot;weaker&quot; or more &quot;female associated&quot; emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I think his second biggest complaint/wound from his childhood is his father&#39;s absence.  He was always too busy with work or his own hobbies to be there for his only son.  No face at the swim meets, little league, or other events, no presence in the home like his mother.  How sad, and yet how typical.  How horrible what we do to our boys, and every bit as horrifying as what we do to girls.  Thank the Goddess for Unschooling, free thinking, and respect for children.<br/>

I cannot talk...so I am typing.  But maybe without much success.  We shall see when I re-read this later. Ha!)<br/>

&nbsp;I second that, Nanci!&nbsp; I think having a boy (my son is 2-1/2)
is one of the most challenging and exciting things that could have happened
in my life!&nbsp; And the second most exciting thing is watching my husband
grow as he makes conscious parenting decisions and as he gently nurtures
our son.&nbsp; My husb. did have a great dad, though, and very respectful
and involved parents.&nbsp; But, my point (and I do have one) is that so
much is at stake in raising young men and women -- for them and for us!&nbsp;
We are so lucky...
