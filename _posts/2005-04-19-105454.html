<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662222459">Sorry for the generic post to everyone who responded to my question.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have time to reply individually.<br/>
I do appreciate all the replys and I am more comfortable with where we <br/>
are at.<br/>
I did talk to my ds and asked him what he thought.  He said he is not <br/>
sure that he is ready to go alone.<br/>
I know we have had registered sex offenders living within a few blocks <br/>
of us, but I don&#39;t know currently (I need to look this up).<br/>
I am really learning a lot from this group.  Thank you so much!<br/>
I am also trying to save up some money for the Live and Learn <br/>
conference.  I think it would be great for us to attend.  We will see.<br/>
Thanks, again.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t apologize!  That&#39;s a MUCH better use of a big list like this.  And as <br/>
we&#39;re trying to discuss the issues and not the individuals, it&#39;s best to batch <br/>
the ideas, synthesize them into one response and reply to the group as a <br/>
whole. <br/>
