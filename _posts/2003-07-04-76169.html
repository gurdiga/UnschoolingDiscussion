 </span></blockquote>Yes. I&#39;m the person who brought the idea into the conversation. I&#39;m the <br/>
breadwinner in our family and recently when my dh was in the hospital I <br/>
ended up taking the kids to a childcare provider who was not already a <br/>
friend of ours.<br/>
<br/>
I did check licensing and met her and found her nice and pleasant, and <br/>
the kids still hated going.<br/>
<br/>
It cost a fortune and they hated every time they went--6 or 7 times. I <br/>
just couldn&#39;t think of a better solution.<br/>
<br/>
My dh will probably need to be hospitalized again some day, and I&#39;m <br/>
working on finding a better solution for then, but haven&#39;t yet. I can <br/>
take *some* time off, but not necessarily as much time as I would need to.<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome email offlist of how others support their families <br/>
without having to leave them. I don&#39;t need to make a fortune, but <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to live again right at the edge of poverty.<br/>

I let Jonathan stay at the Fred Meyer&#39;s Playland but only because he BEGGED<br/>
me.  LOL  It was such a foreign idea to me that when he asked I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
what to do.  The Playland is completely visible from the check stands and we<br/>
wander past every few minutes to check on him.  Plus, he&#39;s 5 and VERY good<br/>
at telling adults what he thinks.  He&#39;s always dissapointed to leave so it<br/>
must be a good experience<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, Lanora and I have to find enough stuff to look at for an hour so<br/>
he can be in there.  It gives us a bit of time to chat and hang out together<br/>
though.<br/>
