<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777987978">I&#39;m not actually disapponted at all.  I hope none of you are.  This is <br/>
commentary on that same list of coke-uses and abuses:<br/>
<br/>

Origins: Â  Many of the entries above are just simple household tips involving <br/>
Coca-Cola. That you can cook and clean with Coke is relatively meaningless <br/>
from a safety standpoint -- you can use a wide array of common household <br/>
substances (including water) for the same purposes; that doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
make them dangerous. The fact is that all carbonated soft drinks contain <br/>
carbonic acid, which is moderately useful for tasks such as removing stains <br/>
and dissolving rust deposits (although plain soda water is much better for <br/>
such purposes than Coca-Cola or other soft drinks, as it doesn&#39;t leave a <br/>
sticky sugar residue behind). Carbonic acid is relatively weak, however, and <br/>
people have been drinking carbonated water for many years with no detrimental <br/>
effects. <br/>
<br/>
The rest of the claims offered here are, in a word, stupid. Coca-Cola does <br/>
contain small amounts of citric acid (from the orange, lemon, and lime oils <br/>
in its formula) and phosphoric acid. However, all the insinuations about the <br/>
dangers these acids might pose to people who drink Coca-Cola ignore a simple <br/>
concept familiar to any first-year chemistry student: concentration. <br/>
Coca-Cola contains less citric acid than orange juice does, and the <br/>
concentration of phosphoric acid in Coke is far too small (a mere 11 to 13 <br/>
grams per gallon of syrup, or about 0.20 to 0.30 per cent of the total <br/>
formula) to harm anyone, no matter how much Coke he guzzles. The only people <br/>
who proffer the ridiculous statements that Coca-Cola will dissolve a steak, a <br/>
tooth, or a nail in a matter of days are people who have never actually tried <br/>
any of these things, because they just don&#39;t happen. (Anyone who conducts <br/>
these experiments will find himself at the end of two days with a whole <br/>
tooth, a whole nail, and one very soggy t-bone.) <br/>
<br/>
The next time you&#39;re stopped by a highway patrolman, try asking him if he&#39;s <br/>
ever cleaned blood stains off a highway with Coca-Cola. If you&#39;re lucky, by <br/>
the time he stops laughing he&#39;ll have forgotten about the citation he was <br/>
going to give you.</div>

corelation (not necessarily causation) between Cola consumption and bone<br/>
fractures in teenage girls.  The suggested mechanism is the phosphoric acid<br/>
having some effect on calcium in bones.<br/>
