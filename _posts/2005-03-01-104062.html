<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753497841">Just my $.02....we have mutual funds for the boys so the money can be <br/>
used for something other than college if they so choose.  Then if they <br/>
get scholarships they can use the money for housing, car, books...or to <br/>
start their own business like someone else said...<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about!<br/>
<br/>
She could just as easily (and typically) have said she&#39;d pay for twice that on college. Parents do that every day. <br/>
<br/>
But major cool to have parents who will support whatever endeavor the child chooses to pursue!<br/>
