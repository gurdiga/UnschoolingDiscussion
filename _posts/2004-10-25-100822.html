&lt;&lt; &gt; One of the factors that drew me to homeschooling rather than public<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; schooling was that I thought learning should be fun. But only the<br/>
&gt; unschoolers were focusing on fun and having positive relationships with<br/>
&gt; their kids. Much of the other forums were devoted to how to make kids <br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; their work, what products were best, what to do with younger kids while<br/>
&gt; older ones did their work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;This got me thinking, Joyce. Because I found unschooling the same way, <br/>
just looking for homeschooling information and discovered that the <br/>
message boards where the unschoolers were talking were the ones that <br/>
got my heart racing because they were so alive and sparkly with ideas <br/>
and energy and fun and love of their children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite memories from those times were when someone who was <br/>
careful to identify with the structured side of town, as it were, would come over <br/>
to the unschooling board with a really off-the-wall and interesting question of <br/>
obscure nature.   And each time, the person said something like, &quot;I figured <br/>
if anyone knew this it would be one of you.&quot;   And the questions would be about <br/>
history, usually, or a request for how something might be connected to <br/>
something else, or how a child might be hooked up with an interesting mentor.<br/>
<br/>
It was as blatant an acknowledgement as could have been, for me, that the <br/>
other homeschoolers respected us as more knowledgeable and creative and aware of <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
So why wouldn&#39;t they then also want to unschool?<br/>
Some did.  <br/>
Some people who started on that end crossed the tracks and loosened up.<br/>
<br/>
But some people don&#39;t consider themselves to be knowledgeable or creative, <br/>
and (perhaps) have decided that they don&#39;t need to start now.  They&#39;re out of <br/>
school and don&#39;t have to learn anything else.  Their kids can have school fed <br/>
into and through them and then *they* won&#39;t need to learn anything else.<br/>
<br/>
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, as is <br/>
mathematically stated.    Sometimes a straight line isn&#39;t possible (thinking of airline <br/>
flight paths, for one thing &lt;g&gt;), and my children didn&#39;t HAVE two points to <br/>
pass one to another.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
The complications come from the combination of philosophical elements (as <br/>
Julie mentioned) and of the defensiveness of parents who say &quot;I don&#39;t have to do <br/>
all that&quot; (whatever &quot;that&quot; is for them). <br/>
<br/>
True. <br/>
<br/>
No parent has to do anything.  They choose to do things.<br/>
<br/>
So being in that world of choices, where do they decide to stop and why?<br/>
<br/>
There comes the philosophy back.<br/>
<br/>
Through all the innumerable factors, how DO people decide?<br/>
<br/>
By deciding what principles they are following.  Each principle one clings to <br/>
eliminates about half the choices in the world easily, and in a good way.   <br/>
Each additional principle eliminates some more options, until the world becomes <br/>
manageable.<br/>
<br/>
One of my guiding principles is that I want my children&#39;s worlds to be <br/>
sparkly.<br/>
<br/>
There goes the dull and the darkness.  Easily not chosen, not an option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037284184">That was a great post!  <br/>
<br/>
But your statement about parental choice really made me think about attitudes toward choosing.   As I learned during a noted train-wreck of a discussion on another list,  there seem to be some number people in the world who do not believe that they have choices -- instead feeling that there are some number of things that they *have* to do.  (And that their children will *have* to do).  (The same people seem to me to tend not to think of &quot;joy&quot; as a sufficient goal, either -- maybe the two attitudes are related?).  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe until people realize that they CAN choose, they are already constrained and stopped - without even the benefit of having made the conscious choice to stop. I am coming to think that realizing that *one has a choice* a necessary prerequisite to ever &quot;getting it&quot; about radical unschooling.  <br/>
