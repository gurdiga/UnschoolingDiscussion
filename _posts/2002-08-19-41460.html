This is part of a thread from two weeks ago that I didn&#39;t answer:<br/>
<br/>
I had written:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Unschoolers are in the same war as all other homeschoolers. I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;&gt; that is Off Topic at all.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;war&quot; is the one in which homeschoolers are trying to keep our rights,<br/>
while school system employees and certain politicians are working to<br/>
eliminate those rights.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Tia wrote (from Canada):<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not in a war.  One of many reasons why I left the U.S. is the tendency<br/>
&gt; there to turn everything into a war.  (war on poverty, war on drugs,<br/>
&gt; etc.)  I&#39;m really a pretty peaceable person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned responds: <br/>
We are all &quot;pretty peacable persons,&quot; but when our rights are threatened,<br/>
there is sometimes no option but to act in our own defense. Otherwise, we<br/>
can kiss our rights good-bye.<br/>

school system employees and politicians.<br/>
