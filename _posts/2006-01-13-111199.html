<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115399850">I think that is a great name. It much more positve an d I think it <br/>
will lead to a more open minded discussion. I remeber when I was first <br/>
introduced to radical unschooling I was turned off by the name. The <br/>
friend who introduced it me impressed me with her character so I did <br/>
become interested after some time despite the name.<br/>
