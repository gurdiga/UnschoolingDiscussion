<div id="ygrps-yiv-670146327">Someone sent me a link to a long but really good anti-spanking article from  <br/>
Theology Today.  The &quot;today&quot; was early 1981, so the article is twenty five  <br/>
years old.  Please, if you have any doubts about whether spanking is bad,  or if <br/>
you have relatives or friends who spank, or if you&#39;re just interested in  the <br/>
state of the world and other nations&#39; opinions of the U.S. (for American  <br/>
readers especially) it&#39;s worth a read and probably a link worth saving in a safe  <br/>
place.  _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm_">http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm_</a> <br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ll link it from my spanking page too, _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking_">http://sandradodd.com/spanking_</a> <br/>

I thought this quote was about much more than spanking and so even those of  <br/>
us who are already resolved not to spank might consider these ideas:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Spanking is primarily an adult or parental problem. When the spanking  <br/>
situation is analyzed, in nearly every incident there is a personal problem of  <br/>
parents who resorted to the use of the &quot;rod.&quot; It was really the adult ego that  <br/>
had been defied, an adult order disobeyed, an adult request denied, adult  <br/>
authority challenged, adult pride or adult respect offended.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes people&#39;s unschooling or parenting blocks are of that order  too.  <br/>
It&#39;s because they&#39;re putting their parental pride or identity above  the real <br/>
needs of their real child.  Some parents put their personal desire  for a child <br/>
to &quot;do a workbook&quot; or to recite times tables far above what the  child wants <br/>
or needs or would benefit by.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not a fun or easy thing to think about, but it&#39;s important.<br/>
