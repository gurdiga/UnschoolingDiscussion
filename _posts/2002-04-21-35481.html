<div id="ygrps-yiv-191509668">Hi all, I am new here, have been lurking for a few days and reading the <br/>
recent discussions.   <br/>
    My question is How do you deal with others as you move towards an <br/>

telling you they are not learning anything when you know they are? My kids <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543918980">Whoa, it&#39;s like looking in a mirror...<br/>
   We&#39;ve been hsing 3 years, I have a 6yo dd and nearly-11 yo ds, and all<br/>
the same questions you do.<br/>
   I feel like I&#39;m coming along fine on the new paradigm, dd is fine because<br/>
she doesn&#39;t know any better than to live and learn, but ds still has<br/>
schoolish thinking. (He was in ps K-2). He recently picked up and read a<br/>
biography of Babe Ruth, so when I noticed a TV movie about his life I<br/>
pointed it out and we sat down to watch it. A friend came by to play and<br/>
Sean said not now, he was doing school(!) I nearly choked. I let it go at<br/>
the time, but I continue to quietly stress that there&#39;s no such thing as<br/>
school, it&#39;s all just life.<br/>
   I did ask him if he thought he was learning more now and he said yes.<br/>
Have you talked with them about it? What are they measuring themselves<br/>
against? I also point out unschoolers&#39; websites or Grace Llewyllen&#39;s books<br/>
too, but it&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t think that applies to him. When I notice he<br/>
knows something I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him, I&#39;ll point it out in an offhand way,<br/>
showing him he&#39;s picked it up himself. I think a lot of it is that school<br/>
tells them they *can&#39;t* learn by themselves and are fools to think so, and<br/>
then TV and church and other kids all reinforce that. You&#39;re the lone voice<br/>
empowering them, and that&#39;s an uphill battle. Are there any projects or<br/>
money-making ideas they could get going to see what autonomy feels like?<br/>
(And not wait till after college, like most people?)<br/>
   Then there&#39;s dh. Since we&#39;ve always been relaxed, he hasn&#39;t noticed the<br/>
unschooling since he works out of town during the week. I&#39;m gradually<br/>
exposing him to the concepts, but I could see it going both ways: acceptance<br/>
or rejection. I just keep my fingers crossed.<br/>
   I&#39;m going to sit down here beside you now and see what others have to<br/>
say...<br/>

<br/>
I am sure that much of it has to do with having been in school as I get much <br/>
more of it from my 14yro than the 11yro. On a funny note my 11yro was mad at <br/>
me the other day and told me that if I had a job like other moms and he was <br/>
in school he would be able to read better. I thought that line of reasoning <br/>
was hilarious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I think *I&#39;ve* finally gotten unschooling, but my 14 yo ds <br/>
hasn&#39;t.  There aren&#39;t any homeschoolers around here that he can relate to, <br/>
so all of his friends go to school or are finished with it.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
say, but I&#39;m pretty sure he gets a lot of questions about what he studies <br/>
and stuff.  And I&#39;m sure he gets a lot of brainwashing about school being <br/>
the way into a career and all that.<br/>
<br/>
The other night he asked me if we could get him into a &quot;program&quot; to get <br/>
&quot;caught up&quot;.  I asked what his purpose was for getting &quot;caught up&quot;, and all <br/>
he had was a vague, &quot;I might want to go to university.&quot;  I know this isn&#39;t <br/>
him *wanting* to go to university.  It&#39;s him thinking he *should* go.<br/>
<br/>
Most of this problem has been caused by me.  Having panicked when he wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading at 12, I pushed.  That taught him that I didn&#39;t believe he could <br/>
learn to read on his own.  Several months after that, and after I&#39;d come to <br/>
my senses and stopped the forced reading practice, he said he might want to <br/>
go to school the next year.  I was *really* reluctant to send a kid who was <br/>
barely reading and writing to grade 8.  Aside from the problems I figured <br/>
he would have coping with the work load, I could just see the teacher&#39;s <br/>
union using his lack of skills in language arts to lobby for more control <br/>
over homeschoolers.  So I told him he needed to be caught up to grade level <br/>
in the basics before he could go.  Of course now I wonder if maybe I should <br/>
have just let him go.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m the one who convinced him that he was &quot;behind&quot; and needing to be <br/>
&quot;caught up&quot;. . . sigh.  Since he&#39;s a kid who doesn&#39;t like to give much <br/>
feedback during a conversation, I&#39;ve written him a letter.  I gave it to <br/>
him last night, and so far he hasn&#39;t said anything about it.  That&#39;s pretty <br/>
normal for him.  He tends to like to think about things for a while.  This <br/>
is what I wrote to him.  Maybe it will give you some ideas.  Maybe someone <br/>
will have more ideas for me.  Who knows.<br/>
****************************************************************<br/>
I want to explore this desire you have to get &quot;caught up&quot;. I wonder if you <br/>
believe what the school system believes, that kids are empty vessels who <br/>
need certain kinds of knowledge poured into them.  They have to be made to <br/>
learn things because learning isn&#39;t any fun.  Well Dad and I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve watched you absorb knowledge like a sponge since you were <br/>
little.  You probably didn&#39;t realize you were learning things because it <br/>
was so easy to do.  When you were in preschool, I realized that the other <br/>
kids knew the colours, and you didn&#39;t.  I made a mental note to play some <br/>
colour games or something with you but didn&#39;t get around to it.  A couple <br/>
of months later, I noticed that you knew the colours.  It&#39;s been like that <br/>
with all kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
You still amaze me with your ability to do mental math.  You&#39;re way better <br/>
than I am at that. I know that you have more trouble with written-down <br/>
math, but most kids do at first.  It&#39;s just a different skill that you can <br/>
learn when you need it.  In fact, I&#39;ll bet you could just start right now <br/>
with, say, algebra, and work your way through any gaps in your math <br/>
knowledge as you learned it.  (You couldn&#39;t do that in school because the <br/>
class would be moving too fast.)<br/>
<br/>
That brings me to purpose for learning.  You seem to have little trouble <br/>
finding out what you want to know about bikes and riding.  You watch.  You <br/>
ask.  You read your magazines.  You read web pages.  You have a purpose, so <br/>
you learn.<br/>
<br/>
The kids in school have a purpose for learning the stuff they learn.  It&#39;s <br/>
called grades, and it&#39;s totally artificial.  Grades don&#39;t even show what <br/>
you&#39;ve actually learned.  They&#39;re just an average of all the scores you get <br/>
on homework and tests in a class.  You can sort of learn everything that&#39;s <br/>
offered in a course and get a C.  You can also be really good at part of it <br/>
while not understanding the rest at all, and you&#39;ll still probably get a <br/>
C.  You can ask your brother or sisters how much of it you&#39;d remember next <br/>
year, or even next week.<br/>
<br/>
We follow a different philosophy of learning.  It&#39;s called <br/>
unschooling.  Some people call it real learning.  Real learning is wanting <br/>
to know something, finding the answers, and enjoying the process.  You <br/>
actually do that all the time, though you haven&#39;t done it much so far in <br/>
the academic areas.<br/>
<br/>
If the reason you want to get caught up is that you are concerned about <br/>
your future, we can work with that. The first thing to do is think about <br/>
your strengths. What are you good at? I&#39;ve started a separate list for <br/>
that, which we can add to. Then you think about what you like doing. Once <br/>
you&#39;ve thought about what you&#39;re good at and like doing, then we can help <br/>
you start thinking about your goals. You take what you like and are good <br/>
at, and explore careers that use those strengths and interests.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to figure out what you need to do in order get started in <br/>
that career. If there&#39;s an academic requirement, we can help you meet it. <br/>
It&#39;s only at that point that you need to be concerned with &quot;catching up&quot; <br/>
and then only in the areas that you&#39;re going to need.<br/>
<br/>
What about university or technical school? Don&#39;t assume that graduating <br/>
from high school and going on to university is a good way into a career. It <br/>
rarely is. If you want to be a doctor or lawyer or veterinarian or <br/>
something like that, you&#39;d need university (and a lot more). But there are <br/>
lots of university grads who still don&#39;t know what they want to be when <br/>
they grow up. A lot of them are flipping burgers to pay off their student <br/>
loans. University is expensive. And for a person who doesn&#39;t use reading <br/>
and writing as their preferred way of learning, it can be painful.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure you could do it if it was your only path into your chosen career, but <br/>
there are probably ways that would work better for you.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of jobs that pay well that don&#39;t involve university. <br/>
Electricians, plumbers, welders, sound technicians, for instance. Those <br/>
usually involve a short college course and then maybe an apprenticeship. <br/>
You get paid during an apprenticeship, and you learn by doing. The book <br/>
learning is minimal for those kinds of jobs. They are also physical jobs, <br/>
which you seem to lean toward. I know you don&#39;t want to plant trees for a <br/>
living, but there are physical jobs that aren&#39;t so hard on your body and <br/>
pay better.<br/>
<br/>
You also have a very good business sense that could be developed if you <br/>
chose to start your own business. I could see you opening a bike store one <br/>
day or running eco tours. (Taking groups of people mountain bike camping, <br/>
for instance.) I could see you building furniture or houses or . . .  Once <br/>
you really start exploring your strengths and interests, you&#39;ll be able to <br/>
think of lots of ideas. We can help you figure out how to make your dreams <br/>
come true, but you have to find the dreams.<br/>

respectful - if you took what he said at face value. What I mean is, you may <br/>
feel like he doesn&#39;t really want to go to a university - but so what? Most <br/>
kids will change their minds a b&#39;zillion times about what they want to do in <br/>
the future. Sometimes it is hard to take them seriously when today they plan <br/>
to become an underwater photographer and yesterday they planned to be a <br/>
doctor &lt;G&gt;. But - still - I&#39;d take it reasonably seriously - to the point, <br/>
for example, of going and looking at a number of college catalogs and seeing <br/>
what the entrance requirements look like. He may just have concerns that his <br/>
future is not being &quot;looked after.&quot; He might be able to enjoy unschooling <br/>
more if he had more reassurance that future options weren&#39;t being closed to <br/>
him because of &quot;lack of preparation&quot; now. &quot;University&quot; - might be a sort of <br/>
euphemism for that idea of &quot;future options.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
So - your letter to him is exactly what I meant. We adults put so much <br/>
thought into the unschooling decision and we sometimes expect that the kids <br/>
will just &quot;get it.&quot;  To write out an explanation of your thinking is SO COOL. <br/>
Even if he comes back with arguments or &#39;yeah, but&#39; and still worrying - it <br/>
is the road to being a &quot;team.&quot; And that is SO important to establish now - <br/>
because even AS a team, those teen years can be hard on parent-child <br/>
relationships.<br/>

watch out for some examples you can give people.<br/>
<br/>
And, you know that you don&#39;t have to explain unschooling to just anybody, <br/>
right? <br/>
<br/>
For those you DO want to explain it to - the kids themselves and your dh, for <br/>
example, you might have a look at Carol Narigon&#39;s &quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; on <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>

You could spend a little time rewriting it for your own kids -- and then ask <br/>
your husband to help you go over it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088981779">Hi Laura, I have two sons aged 14&11 too.  I also have a 9 y.o. son and a<br/>
7y.o. daughter.  I&#39;m not sure how long it has been since your kids were<br/>
in school, but I think the de-schooling process takes longer the longer<br/>
they were in school.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much, since it is a<br/>
process.  Really listening to them talk about their interests is so<br/>
important.  To overhear their conversations with one another, and to<br/>
watch what they do in their spare time, then write it down and be aware<br/>
of it seems to help me.  Then we attract it like magnets, I think because<br/>
when we see it we recognize it as an interest.  At the beginning of our<br/>
unschooling odysssey, I said, okay, so how do you want to do it?  The<br/>
kids said they wanted required reading, writing and math.  So I wrote it<br/>
down on the wall for them to remind themselves with.  After a while, they<br/>
were only requiring themselves to do math.  Then, as they were spending<br/>
all their time doing the things they were interested in, they forgot<br/>
about the math.  They seem to always have a theme that they are doing. <br/>
It usually lasts a week or two, then they are into something new.  It<br/>
keeps them busy, and me too.  I&#39;ve taken to writing down what they are<br/>
doing and making a weekly unschooling newspaper chronicling it so that I<br/>
can show it to my husband or relatives who are clueless about<br/>
unschooling.  I also print out posts and articles that explain and show<br/>
how unschooling works.  I have a little folder I keep these in for<br/>
reference and show them to my husband as they come up.  <br/>

  &lt;   My question is How do you deal with others as you move towards an<br/>
  unschooling lifestyle? &gt;<br/>
  [Joan Wilson]<br/>
<br/>
  For those that are not as accepting to the idea of unschooling I keep it<br/>
brief.  I may let them know what we are &quot;studying&quot; or doing, i.e. hiking --<br/>
&quot;We have recently been exploring natural sciences using the different state<br/>
parks in our area.  We have been exploring how the different eco systems<br/>
work both on their own and with each other.  What is your family learning<br/>
about?&quot;  or &quot;What is your child studying?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  Or maybe &quot;My one son has been reading the original version of Journey To<br/>
The Center Of The Earth.  I know this is not suggested reading until Middle<br/>
or High School but he has found it interesting on his own accord and is<br/>
capable of reading and understanding it.  What are your children reading?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  And she wrote:<br/>
  &lt;How about when it&#39;s the kids themselves that keep<br/>
  telling you they are not learning anything when you know they are? My kids<br/>
  had previously been in school and play with kids who go to school so I<br/>
know<br/>
  where some of the flack comes from but it is still so hard to deal with.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  My reply is:<br/>
<br/>
  My son went through this also.  Peer pressure from his friends that go to<br/>
school.  He went to K - part of 3rd.<br/>
<br/>
  I asked him what did he want that he thought he was missing out on?<br/>
Homework?  We can do that but we don&#39;t want to or need to.  Drama?  We can<br/>
do that at different places to.  Learning how to read?  He knows how.<br/>
Having to read what someone tells him to read? He didn&#39;t like that idea.<br/>
They are into wresteling - he is not. Baseball?  Did that outside of school.<br/>
Diploma?  Not a problem - I explained that there are people that have been<br/>
and are helpful in that area should he need one.  College?  Not there yet -<br/>
but he will go if he wishes to.  A good job?  Not there yet either.  But<br/>
unless he goes to college, the only thing that may matter is being old<br/>
enough or having a diploma or an idea and the determination to learn what he<br/>
needs and to carry out his dream. Age is a matter of time and having a<br/>
diploma is not going to be a problem, the rest is up to him when he is<br/>
ready. He finally decided he was not missing anything.<br/>
<br/>
  Then I had a talk with the friends and explained that this works for us<br/>
and that this or that may be important to them or thier parents it was not<br/>
something that is required in order to have a normal fulfilling life for<br/>
some people.  Come to find out -- they both want to do what we are doing<br/>
instead of going to school.<br/>
<br/>
  As for my son thinking he is not learning anything ... a little &quot;review&quot;<br/>
of his life and what we have been doing helped.  I reminded him that he can<br/>
and is able to do mathamatical equations in his head that I require a<br/>
calculator to perform.  I have also asked him things like &quot;Did you know such<br/>
and such before we read/heard/found out about it?&quot; or I will ask his friends<br/>
what they have been learning in school and relate back to them in front of<br/>
my son or later to just him what we have done recently in real life that<br/>
would be equivilant.<br/>
<br/>

  &lt; It makes me feel phony when I try to explain to them how them doing this<br/>
or that is math or history, etc.&gt;<br/>
  My response is:<br/>
<br/>
  Then don&#39;t.  If you do and you feel phony it probably comes off as<br/>
phony -- What if you let them know that putting it this way doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
right to you -- it feels phony -- but what is school? - a phony way of<br/>
presenting real life.  What if you let them know that if this was a lesson<br/>
in school it would fall under the subject of Math or History or Social<br/>
Studies or Home Economics or Physical Education - but school needs to divide<br/>
things or life into subjects in order to study that one entity and it is up<br/>
to the student to find away to incorporate the information into thier own<br/>
real life.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps at 14 he knows what he wants but just needs help on how to get<br/>
there.  And depending on how long you&#39;ve been Homeschooling or Unschooling<br/>
maybe he just needs a break.  Then again if he really feels a need to<br/>
&quot;study&quot; for something - How does he feel about studying for his GED or the<br/>
CHSPE (I don&#39;t know what state you are in or what is in your state -- in CA<br/>
these are tests for high school completion or equivalency).<br/>

  My thoughts are:<br/>
<br/>
  This is a problem with my hubby also.  I think pamS has a very good<br/>
suggestion in her reply with the suggestion of using Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; on Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>
<br/>
  Course, I just never even gave him a choice in the matter and continue to<br/>
explain to him that school is not at all what it was when he was in school<br/>
(he&#39;s<br/>
  now in his 50&#39;s) and perhaps he would like to spend some time going to one<br/>
to see first hand the things that I myself have witnessed.  And I also<br/>
remind him of the homework that our son would bring home and how he (hubby)<br/>
would say &quot;They had him there for 6 hours - if they can&#39;t teach him in that<br/>
amount of time then what are they doing with that time -- there is no reason<br/>
he should need to bring home this work -- this is the time he has to play&quot;<br/>
etc. And then I remind him of my response of &quot;they don&#39;t have time to teach<br/>
children in school ... that is why they send the work home for us to teach<br/>
them&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt; BTW, my kids are 11<br/>
  and 14, both boys.<br/>
  Laura &gt;<br/>
  Ours are 32, 11 and 5 - all boys.<br/>
<br/>
  I wish you the best in your journeys through life and learning,<br/>
