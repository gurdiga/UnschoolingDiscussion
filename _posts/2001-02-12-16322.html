this with the kids.&nbsp; :o) <br>~~~~~~~~~ <br>January 2001&nbsp;<br><br>Dear 
Home Educators and Supporters of Home Education,&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Too often 
the home school community is caught off&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; guard by legislation 
aimed at limiting or prohibiting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; home schooling. We&#39;re busy with 
our families and don&#39;t&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; always use the opportunities that arise 
to ensure the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; future of teaching our children. Don&#39;t be 
deceived!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Groups that are AGAINST home education are 
frequently&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; lobbying local, state, and federal officials for 
more&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; control over our children. We need to 
continually&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; work to keep the laws we currently have as well as 
to&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; improve them.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Right now we have an 
opportunity to be proactive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; President George W. Bush is 
committed to education&nbsp;</font></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; 
reform and open to ideas that work. Home education&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; has proven 
itself over and over to be effective. Now&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; is the time to plant 
seeds for future legislation from&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Washington, D.C. that will 
safeguard home schooling.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Join us in a simple project to 
make the home schooling&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; community visible to President Bush and 
Secretary Rod&nbsp;</font></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; 
Paige (Dept. of Education) in an encouraging,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; non-threatening 
manner. Participate in our &quot;Postcards&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; for Choice in Education.&quot; 
Here is the plan:&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Postcards 
for Choice in 
Education&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Between 
now and the end of February each home&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; schooling family OR each 
family that supports home&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; schooling (grandparents, aunts and 
uncles, friends,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; neighbors) sends postcards to Washington,D.C. 
Send one&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; to President George W. Bush and one to the 
Secretary&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; of Education. (Addresses are below.) Write a 
simple&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; note to each gentleman asking for his support 
in&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; defending home education. If your family is 
praying&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; for him, tell him so.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 
 </span></blockquote>Postcards&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
Any tactful postcard would be fine. A postcard 
with&nbsp;</font></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;your state or region&#39;s name on the front would 
be a&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;quick and effective visual to show how diverse 
the&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; home education movement 
is.&nbsp;<br></font></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><font
 face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 
 </span></blockquote>Message&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
Any polite, simple message in support of home&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; schooling is 
acceptable. Some suggestions follow--&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; A. Home Education 
Works-2001&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; B. Support a parent&#39;s right to educate 
their&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; children.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; C. Support our 
right to choose the appropriate&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; education for our 
children.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; D. Parents make great 
teachers!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; E. The heart of education is the 
HOME.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; F. Support parents who teach their children at 
home.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; G. Be a defender of home 
education.&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp; 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mailing&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br> </span></blockquote>&nbsp; 
The new postal rate increase did not change the cost&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; for sending 
a standard size postcard. It is still 20&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; cents. An old 33 cent 
stamp would work too if getting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; to the post office is 
inconvenient. For the signature,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; be sure to name yourself as a 
home educator or&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; supporter of home education. For 
example--&nbsp;<br></font></font></font></div>

The Honorable George W. Bush&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; President, United States of 
America&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Washington, D.C. 20500&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Honorable Rod 
Paige&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary, Department of 
Education&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 Maryland Ave. S.W.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Washington, D.C. 20202&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Involve Your 
 </span></blockquote>Children&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Your children can use this opportunity to write&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; postcards 
themselves in support of home schooling.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be in 
addition to your own cards or in place&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; of them. The key 
here is to have as many families&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; represented as possible, 
and multiple cards from a&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; family are acceptable. If your 
children write, please&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; help them to write clearly and 
neatly. Children could&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; say how many years they&#39;ve been 
taught at home, who&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; teaches them, or what they like best 
about their&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; lessons. Again, if your children pray for 
our&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; officials, mention that on the 
card.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &gt;&gt;Thank 
You&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thank you for participating in Postcards for Choice in&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Education. May God bless our efforts to defend our&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
families.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of this project depends 
upon each of you&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; forwarding this message to other home 
school family or&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; supporter you know. PLEASE! SEND THIS 
E-MAIL ONLY TO&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; PEOPLE WHO TRULY SUPPORT HOME EDUCATION. 
Now, go send that 
postcard!</font>&nbsp;<br><br></font><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
