<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468724629">Elissa, I can feel it, too!  Wow, what a relief that would have been, and<br/>
how much happier and more fulfilling my life could have been.  It makes<br/>
me want to laugh and cry at the same time.  I think if I had known about<br/>
unschooling, I would have learned all sorts of languages, traveled around<br/>
the world, become involved in performing arts, and become a journalist. <br/>
The fact is, I did what I was told and never did do anything I wanted,<br/>
even after I was on my own, because I doubted myself.  <br/>

learning shouldn&#39;t stop for us either. It&#39;s hard as a school trained adult <br/>
to get over those doubts, but it is possible. I&#39;m living proof. :o)<br/>
