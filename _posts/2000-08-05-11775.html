<div id="ygrps-yiv-869302821">This is really OT but I am having a problem with my email service and <br/>
they don&#39;t seem to be able to fix it, hence I an in search of another <br/>
email service. The problem I am facing is that I can only send email <br/>
from the net and I receive my email through an email program on my <br/>
comp. So when I reply to a post it doesn&#39;t get sent. It just sits <br/>
there on my comp using up space. I have been looking for a service in <br/>
which I can send email through my email program but can&#39;t seem to be <br/>
able to find one that gives the stmp info. so that I can do this. <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to turn for this type of <br/>
free email service?   Corallyn  P.S. This is why I have been so quiet <br/>
lately.</div>
