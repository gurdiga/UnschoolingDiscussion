<div id="ygrps-yiv-869663390">Hi Again, <br/>
I am so full of energy since I found you guys.I have been posting quite <br/>
oftener than I usually do because your responses are very  thoughtful( <br/>
not in the polite sense, but in the &quot;lots of thought put into your <br/>
responses&quot; sense, which actually is very polite)<br/>
So here goes...<br/>
Although I am not into labeling,I have observed my daughter display <br/>
ways of aquiring and processing information that are currently <br/>
described as dyslexic. <br/>
One wonderful example: We aquired a used set of encyclopedias( this is <br/>
such a cool story...When we first began to homeschool, I casually <br/>
requested God to supply us with a set of free encyclopedias. There&#39;s <br/>
just something about curling up with an encyclopedia that is so <br/>
satisfying. Anyway, one morning while taking a detour through a very <br/>
affluent neighborhood, guess what was set out on the curb side trash <br/>
pile? A whole set of encyclopedias!Well, we took them home, scrubbed <br/>
them up , and set them out in the hot Florida sun to dry.)Later that <br/>
day, my daughter proudly showed me that she had set them up in our book <br/>
case. From Z to A -smile)<br/>
I think of this as an interesting part of who she is. <br/>
I do not think of it as a &quot;dys&quot; anything.<br/>
I am very interested in how this is viewed by the Unschoolers.<br/>
I&#39;d enjoy your thoughts on this.<br/>

All young kids work from the middle out, in either direction.  At  <br/>
some point each kid figures out some personal way to decide which is  <br/>
(in our writing system) &quot;the right way.&quot;  Some spend longer than  <br/>
others doing things like writing their names backwards (like mirror  <br/>
writing) or not.  Some have some personal trick early on and they go  <br/>
left to right.  That&#39;s not dyslexia, it&#39;s a natural part of language  <br/>
learning.  There&#39;s a term for it, but I don&#39;t remember.  I think  <br/>
&quot;lateral&quot; is in it somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter what labels could be put on how a kid figures out  <br/>
directions or writing numerals or writing words or knowing &quot;b&quot; from  <br/>
&quot;d&quot; each and every one, in school or out, learns it his or her own way.<br/>

Up untill this summer , when she got glasses to correct a tracking <br/>
disorder and nearsightedness, she hated to read.Duh! The glasses made <br/>
reading much easier. She has learned ways to compensate for  other <br/>
characteristics of dyslexia.<br/>

 I agree.<br/>
Home schooling allowed me to see her dyslexic -like characteristics.<br/>
Unschooling allowed me to see her unique ways of compensating (that <br/>
is the eduspeak word for finding another way)  with specific ways to <br/>
how she learns about the world around her. These compensations are <br/>
unique to me, but are typical for those descibed as Dyslexic.For <br/>
example, when she can&#39;t recall a certain word, she will describe or <br/>
act out what that word does. &quot;You know, that thing that you push <br/>
around the floor that goes vroom and sucks up the dirt&quot; and she will <br/>
do the pushing action and  the sound effects. This is just one <br/>
example, and yes we all do this at times,but with my child, this is a <br/>
pattern. I do not consider it a problem. If communication is the <br/>
goal, then <br/>
this is an interesting , entertaining, and effective way to <br/>
communicate.                     <br/>
She obviously has been doing this her whole life, but the Unschooling <br/>
approach of learning all the time puts the focus on learning in lots <br/>
of ways, rather than on &quot;not learning&quot; in specific ways. <br/>
So this brings me to my question,<br/>
What is the value of a diagnosis for an Unschooled child?<br/>
This is a personal decision, of course, but I am interested in the<br/>
Unschooling community&#39;s thoughts. <br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Lynn<br/>

-=- Do you mean Lateralization, specific tasks done by one hemisphere of<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s some kind of midline thing, where the kid knows it starts in  <br/>
the middle and goes to the side, but the difference between left and  <br/>
right isn&#39;t established, so if the first letter is written backwards,  <br/>
the whole rest of the word goes backwards, just as it would look in a  <br/>
mirror, so that each letter is correctly in relationship to the  <br/>
letter before it.  Not individual letters backwards, but the whole  <br/>
word properly done, mirror-like.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;disability,&quot; it&#39;s natural and sensible.  Or a kid might  <br/>
write the numbers out the same way, to the left.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What makes that dyslexia!?  I have no symptoms of dyslexia and never  <br/>
have, but it&#39;s not freakishly unusual for me to say something like  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s on the refrigerator&quot; and someone will say (kindly) &quot;the  <br/>
refrigerator we wash the clothes in?&quot;  And after a pause to visualize  <br/>
where the thing is I&#39;ll say...  &quot;Yes.  That one.&quot;   It happens when  <br/>
I&#39;m hungry, tired, or very distracted.  The first time it happened, I  <br/>
was twelve or thirteen and couldn&#39;t think of any word for that flat  <br/>
asphalt thing in front of our house that the cars drive on except  <br/>
&quot;trail.&quot;   I fished for a better word, and got &quot;trail.&quot;  Then the  <br/>
entire thesaurus of my mind came back to me and I had road, street,  <br/>
pavement... but for a moment there, I didn&#39;t have them.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a word for forgetting nouns too, isn&#39;t there?  dis-something- <br/>
ia.  Dysphasia?  Mild dysphasia can be momentary.  And it can be  <br/>
amusing.  It can also be a big deal and progressively worse and have  <br/>
to do with irreparable brain damage, but I don&#39;t think being so zippy- <br/>
minded that a noun is temporarily unavailable is a disability.  Or  <br/>
maybe in children sometimes it&#39;s just that they haven&#39;t connected  <br/>
enough things inside to be able to access the noun when they&#39;re  <br/>
thinking about other things that are, at that point, still  <br/>
&quot;unrelated.&quot;  Every mental connection we make might make the rest of  <br/>
our brain more accessible.  One more cross-reference.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What is the value of a diagnosis for an Unschooled child?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Will you get cash and valuable prizes, or will you just make her feel  <br/>
there&#39;s something wrong with her?<br/>
(Those aren&#39;t the only two choices, but to which end will it lean?   <br/>
Why risk it, in the absence of cash? And how much cash is enough to  <br/>
make the damage to self-esteem worthwhile?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suppose it depends - a diagnosis of a vision problem led to it being <br/>
corrected and now reading is fun. That&#39;s a good diagnosis - it helped. <br/>
A diagnosis of a hearing problem that could be corrected - that&#39;d <br/>
probably be a good diagnosis. A diagnosis related to a &#39;learning <br/>
disability&#39;, well, that&#39;s a whole other kettle of fish since those <br/>
diagnoses are typically defined by school parameters. I very much <br/>
doubt that a diagnosis of &#39;dyslexia&#39; at this point will really do very <br/>
much to help, would it? It sounds like she&#39;s doing just fine <br/>
developing mechanisms within herself to deal with her world. <br/>

<br/>
My forgotten-noun moments seem to last a long time, as if my brain gets <br/>
&quot;stuck&quot;.  But giving up on the word, backing up and trying to give a <br/>
description seems to be the way to get the right word to float up into <br/>
my awareness.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like it&#39;s always nouns, but maybe I&#39;m not remembering <br/>
accurately.  I&#39;ll pay attention for the next month and see what kind of <br/>
variety I get.<br/>
<br/>
I do both things, (1) the being stumped looking for the right word, and <br/>
(2) the careless substituting of other words that have some kind of <br/>
similarity of meaning.  I say &quot;thousands&quot; for &quot;hundreds&quot; and vice versa <br/>

thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, *maybe* for a child in a classroom there is benefit if the teacher <br/>
has a label that awards the child special consideration.  Someone noted that <br/>
test scores went up when dyslexic children are given special help on tests. <br/>
I am willing to bet that ALL children&#39;s test scores would go up if given <br/>
special help.  In a classroom there is always focus on whether a child is <br/>
ahead or behind.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is not about school and classrooms.  Before I discovered <br/>
unschooling, when I made the decision to homeschool, one of my primary <br/>
reasons was to allow my children to learn at their own pace.  It does NOT <br/>
matter if they learn faster, slower, or differently (whether their <br/>
difference is cool or uncool).  They simply learn how they learn.  I help <br/>
them learn by responding to them and providing resources.  You just don&#39;t <br/>
need a label for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599700521">My niece got lots of consideration - but so did EVERY kid in that  <br/>
little school. Each kid was an individual - when you only have five  <br/>
kids in the 4th grade, it isn&#39;t so much important for kids to have a  <br/>
diagnosis, a label, as it is that the parent and teacher communicate  <br/>
well about that particular kid and how he/she is learning, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t supposed to be about school - I left my main point unsaid  <br/>
- the ONLY reason that anybody needed to use the word &quot;dyslexic&quot;  <br/>
about my niece EVEN though she was in school, was for my sister to  <br/>
communicate well with her teachers and to look for ideas/information  <br/>
that would help her learn in her own way. An unschooler, with NO time  <br/>
pressure, no standards pressures, etc., really doesn&#39;t have need to  <br/>
label their child. I NEVER labeled any of mine, and I was able to  <br/>
feel free to look up dyslexia, when my youngest had a lot of  <br/>
frustration because she wanted to read and couldn&#39;t, yet. She may or  <br/>
may not be &quot;diagnosable&quot; - I have no idea, now that she&#39;s 15 and  <br/>
figured out her own ways (compensations). She would have been  <br/>
diagnosed, I think, back then.<br/>
<br/>
Using the terms to look up ideas - I can understand that. But not to  <br/>
label the child - that seems unnecessarily risky.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who learn &quot;differently&quot; need to be helped to understand that  <br/>
EVERYBODY learns in their own way. But unschoolers know that - it is  <br/>
the &quot;norm&quot; for unschoolers. They don&#39;t need a name for it - they need  <br/>
to know that they are unique and that&#39;s great.<br/>

   what I was trying to say (not very well, sorry) was that my partner <br/>
never knew he was dyslexic until adulthood and really didn&#39;t get any <br/>
extra help, even after diagnosis, but he still got a degree. He had a <br/>
hangup from school who had told him he was stupid. If he had been <br/>
unschooled this never would have happened. So I guess that there&#39;s no <br/>
real benefit to getting a diagnosis for an unschooled child.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re unschooling then you&#39;ll know your child. What works for them <br/>
when they want to know how to do something. They don&#39;t have to moulded <br/>
to fit in with someone elses schedule, rules and ideas of what they <br/>
