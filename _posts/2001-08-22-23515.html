<div id="ygrps-yiv-182151791">Janet, you must be in New England. We used to live in Massachusetts and Sturbridge Village was one of my children&#39;s favorite places to learn about history. My boys met Norm Abram of New Yankee workshop there once and it was the highlight of their day. My daughter was amazed with the kitchens and how they prepared the food. We spent days and days there.<br/>
