&gt;&gt; pieces of paper and puts checkmarks by their names (I think for<br/>
&gt;&gt; answering her questions? lol) They each take a turn answering a<br/>
&gt;&gt; question for her and if they don&#39;t understand something, she explains<br/>
&gt;&gt; it to them!  She&#39;s really cute when she does that.<br/>

tiger cubs (cats), wolf den (dogs) and bear dens were easy, but deciding<br/>
things like whether the giraffe should be a webelo or boyscout seemed to<br/>
require extensive study.  Then every den needed a neat little sign and all<br/>
that.  He&#39;s been at this for days.  I really need to sweep his floor, but I<br/>
don&#39;t have the heart to move the &quot;scouts&quot;.  :)<br/>

p.s. the giraffe was deemed a webelo, but the dragon gets to be a boyscout<br/>
