&gt;&lt;&lt; Have you come across any books regarding the Celts and their beliefs?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only things that come right to mind are the YA Dark Is Rising series by <br/>
&gt;Susan Cooper.  (Which, just to be confusing, is the title of the 2nd book.  <br/>
&gt;The first is Over Sea, Under Stone.)  It takes place in modern day Wales but <br/>
&gt;the kids deal with ancient Welsh gods or spirits.  (Though I read it over 20 <br/>
&gt;years ago and my memory could be a bit off.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And one book I ran across a few years ago is a Barnes and Noble special <br/>
&gt;reprint: Irish Folk and Fairytale Omnibus by Michael Scott.  I really like <br/>
&gt;the tone of the stories which is much more like a fantasy novel than other <br/>
&gt;fairy tale compilations, which tend to be shy on character development and <br/>
&gt;sense of place.  (But I&#39;d also say they&#39;re more of an adult/teen level.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s the first couple of paragraphs of the first story:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Sons of Tureen<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brian loosed his sword in its sheath and called over his shoulder to his <br/>
&gt;brothers.  &quot;Rider coming!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They edged their horses up beside their elder broher and stared across the <br/>
&gt;flat expanse of the Plain of Muirthemne.  A lone rider was racing towards <br/>
&gt;them, his armour and weapons flashing in the early morning sunlight and his <br/>
&gt;crimson cloak streaming behind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;A Fomor?&quot; wondered Urchar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Too tall,&quot; replied his twin Iuchar, drawing his sword.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brian reined his horse to a halt.  &quot;We wait; let him come to us.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(See what I mean?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You might try typing in &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;homeschool&quot; into a search engine.  That <br/>
&gt;might turn up a pagan homeschooler who might have a webpage of recommended <br/>
&gt;books.<br/>
