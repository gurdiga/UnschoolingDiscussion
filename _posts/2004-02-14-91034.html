<div id="ygrps-yiv-700546774">Sorry to hear that you&#39;ve been sick! I&#39;ve lost my voice right now which has made for an interesting weekend so far. But a good one...<br/>
 <br/>
Hope you feel better soon!<br/>

I was really hoping I would wake up this morning all better.  Unfortunately, this bug is hanging on for dear life.  It started Monday with a very upset tummy, Tuesday was weak and dizzy, Wednesday started the stuffy/painful sinuses and that continued into Thursday, Friday was runny nose, but I really thought it had to be drawing to a close.  Nope, still here.<br/>
<br/>
Just when I was feeling that I really hadn&#39;t &quot;given&quot; the kids anything at all this week, they showed me just how much they had learned.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents sent cards with stickers and a 10 dollar bill to each of the kids.  When Max (5) opened his he said &quot;WOW!  TEN dollars!  I have to call Nana and thank her SO MUCH!!!  This has the White House on it!!!!&quot;....I didn&#39;t even know he knew what the White House was!!!!  He started to ask what kinds of things ten dollars would by.  I think they&#39;ve settled on going to a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, I was out of Ibuprofen and needed to run out to the store.  I took Madison with me.  He picked out some Valentine&#39;s Day Cupcakes for the family and we headed on to the medicine aisle.  I told him my symptoms and he picked out the Triaminic that would suit me best.  (Adult cold medicine is often a little too much for me).  I gave him 15 dollars and we went through the line.  The total came up to $15.79 and he said &quot;Mom, I need another dollar&quot;.  His change was 21 cents that he informed me was &quot;Two dimes and a penny&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home, we all sat down and read &quot;My Many Colored Days&quot; by Dr. Suess.  The kids decided I was probably having a &quot;Grey Day&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really like to be better now, but I&#39;m just really so proud of them.  <br/>
