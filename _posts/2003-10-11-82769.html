<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036384764">I need some help in getting my house more organized.  I&#39;m de-choring and working on accepting the fact that it will never be house beautiful.  However, I am frustrated with it always looking sooo messy.  I am hoping that some reorganization will help the house look wonderfully lived in, rather than as if a tornado just hit.  We don&#39;t have a family room.<br/>
<br/>
Each girl has her own room, tho they both sleep together in the one with the double bed.  The rooms are good size 12x12.  Closets are pretty standard.  Each closet has two low shelves and a hanging shoe rack.<br/>
<br/>
Clothing is more or less under control, but I could use some ideas for how to store/display dolls, craft supplies/kits, and stuffed animals.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small bathroom in between the rooms, which is also the guest bathroom, due to it&#39;s location.  The counter is tiny.  I hung an organizer on the back of the door, which helps a lot for assorted &quot;beauty supplies&quot;.  Towels fit under the sink, but not much more.  There is a laundry basket and a basket of reading material in there.  We have a stool in there, but it occurs to me that they don&#39;t really need that anymore.<br/>
<br/>
We have a small office with 3 desks and a piano.  Each girl has a box and a file box, but still stuff ends up piled all over the floor.  A small bookshelf hosts the printer, art supplies, and office supplies.<br/>
<br/>
I think we may have too much furniture, or perhaps just the wrong types.  To me, the house looks like it is wall to wall furniture.  A lot of it is antique mix and match stuff that was acquired through my in-laws auction or hand me downs from his folks or mine.  When I think about rearranging, I end up going in circles because anyplace I think to move something, already has something there.  Dh is very attached to most of the furniture.  I&#39;ve suggested selling some of the pieces that we don&#39;t really use, but haven&#39;t gotten very far with that idea.<br/>
<br/>
My budget is limited, so I can&#39;t go out and buy too much to help with this project.  The garage is already stuffed.  I&#39;m thinking about storing some things under the house.  It stays dry, but is really dusty.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Anybody want to share things you&#39;ve done to increase storage or better organize yours and your kid&#39;s stuff?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550483370">I have a fairly large house so not sure if any of this will help. But when<br/>
the 5 of us were in a much smaller house, I still made it all work and<br/>
things were rather organized.<br/>
<br/>
I make a point to go through clothes at least twice a year and get rid of<br/>
things too small and those that are never worn, no matter if they fit or<br/>
not. I do the same thing with other closets, drawers and storage spaces. I<br/>
get rid of anything not used within 6 months. (holiday decorations aside)<br/>
I&#39;ll consign, sell or give things away that aren&#39;t used. It&#39;s just not worth<br/>
them taking up space. And I find most homes have tons of stuff in them that<br/>
are hardly ever used. I don&#39;t believe in keeping something just in case it&#39;s<br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I love is storage crates and bins for the childrens things.<br/>
Both Joseph and Sierra have wooden shelving with plastic bins that go into<br/>
the shelving. Joseph keeps his in his room and Sierra&#39;s is in the playroom.<br/>
There are 4 rows with 3 open bins on each one. It&#39;s easy to throw toys in<br/>
and yet keep certain ones separate.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a stack of 3 plastic crates that are on wheels. Open also. Bins<br/>
with lids makes it harder to get things in and out. I have also bought<br/>
individual plastic crates that can stack and keep various things in them for<br/>
the kids. Not really big on shelves although we have one large set in the<br/>
playroom. I love the plastic storage bins for under the bed also. Each child<br/>
has two under their beds.<br/>
<br/>
They take up small amounts of space and you can get tons of things in them<br/>
without making them so cluttered the kids don&#39;t want to play with what&#39;s<br/>
inside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58913191">A couple of things occur to me from what you posted.  First<br/>
would the girls be able to share the one bed room as a bedroom,<br/>
while converting the other to play/workspace of their own?  4<br/>
desks and a piano in one room is an invitation to feeling<br/>
clutter.  If you can consolidate the bedrooms, take the non<br/>
sleeping one and add lots of shelves, with plastic see through<br/>
bins for storage.  It is easy to take a bin of all the clay<br/>
supplies or all the doll clothes down and use it where ever the<br/>
mood strikes.  And it is easy to put them all back in the bin<br/>
from which they came.  Zip lock Freezer bags are a great adjunct<br/>
to those, for further sub dividing.  Also look at where<br/>
&quot;clutter&quot; accumulates and what the clutter is.  A box and a file<br/>
drawer may not be useful ways to organize what they are doing at<br/>
their desks - evaluating what doesn&#39;t make it back to the box<br/>
might help.  A bulletin board might work better for them - or a<br/>
vertical file holder - or an empty shelf for more acceptable<br/>
temporary storage than the floor provides.<br/>
<br/>
We have a bin of &quot;display items&quot; for dd&#39;s room (actually for a<br/>
number of rooms, but we are talking about kids, LOL).  There is<br/>
limited space for &quot;knick-knacks&quot; so the bin lets her rotate the<br/>
display and also holds holiday specific objects so she can<br/>
re-decorate for the season at will.  A duffle bag hanging in the<br/>
closet holds a wonderful number of stuffed animals too beloved<br/>
to part with but too numerous to display.<br/>
<br/>
Would a vanity in the bedroom reduce the need for beauty<br/>
supplies in the bathroom - and the storage problem?  All that is<br/>
really necessary for a vanity is a small console table and a<br/>
mirror - light strips are nice, but if you cover the table with<br/>
a froth of pretty girl fabric and put a similarly draped stool<br/>
in from of it, it will meet the needs until serious make up<br/>
application is underway.  Get a piece of glass cut to match the<br/>
size of the top, then let them arrange some brushes, hand<br/>
mirrors and perfumes on top - the rest goes in a caddy under the<br/>
table - one for each.  I call mine, rescued from a far too small<br/>
to be useful linen closet, my altar to estrogen, LOL.  Quite<br/>
importantly for my messiness, there is something sorta  charming<br/>
about spilled powder on a vanity that is entirely missing when<br/>
powder is spilled on the sink counter and left.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340761577">Forgot one other thing that I love for the stuffed animals. The nets that<br/>
hang from above in the corner of a room. If there are a lot of animals, you<br/>
can hang a few, still have them displayed and easily accessible and yet<br/>
still out of the way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949453847">Mary Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
Our old house was really small and we had lots of big furniture <br/>
(everyone&#39;s hand-me-downs).  Minimizing furniture and clutter madea <br/>
huge difference.  Are you a pack rat?  Because that breeds clutter.  <br/>
I would start with a major &quot;spring cleaning&quot; to at least reduce your <br/>
piles.  It is painful, but it changes your enviornment more than <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
My sons&#39; old room had them and all their stuff.  We bought the cheap <br/>
white armoire/cabinet from home depot for about $100 (the really big <br/>
one).  I bought bins and put the majority of toys in there and a <br/>
shelf in the closet and under the bed.  This way the clutter was not <br/>
noticable.  Just having doors on things makes the mess go away!  For <br/>
arts and crafts supplies hang a plastic shoe rack/holder over the <br/>
door and you can put all the things in the pockets.  Same for the <br/>
bathroom which can hold lots of little things the girls need <br/>
(barettes, toothpaste, lotions, etc.)  Also, you can build a shelf <br/>
in their rooms that goes across the perimeter of the room way up <br/>
high for all the stuffed animals and toys they don&#39;t play with <br/>
much.  That way it acts more as decor and less as mess.  For the <br/>
bathroom, buy a magazine rack to hang on the wall and use some of <br/>
that vertical space instead of a basket taking up floor space.  <br/>
People forget the vertical space, but even for there dolls it may <br/>
help to hang a few shelves (maybe 3) where they can place them when <br/>
they are not playing with them and that way they are not cluttering <br/>
up the floor.<br/>
<br/>
The big lesson I learned was to  buy very practical furniture.  No <br/>
glass tables, everything with some storage.  This way the majority <br/>
of furniture is dual functioning.  It looks nice and hides things!  <br/>
You can put large baskets under the coffee or end tables for storage <br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a bit!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708034001">When our kids were young and sharing a room, we couldn&#39;t afford cool plastic <br/>
bins, but what we did was my  husband made a shelf designed to hold Xerox <br/>
boxes, which we could get free.  We would put a picture of the kind of toy that <br/>
went in there on the box, and use them kind of like drawers.  The shelf was low <br/>
enough to go under the window, strong enough for toddler boys to climb up on, <br/>
and so they had the top to put stuff on, and there was the base (enclosed so <br/>
toys wouldn&#39;t go under) and two shelves, and a middle divider.  It could hold <br/>
twelve Xerox boxes, end in.  Usually it was some xerox boxes and some toys with <br/>
their own boxes, or things stuffed in.   When a box wore out, we could <br/>
replace it with a better box.  A box could be pulled and and taken into the living <br/>
room or into the yard, left there a  while, used for storage in there, and then <br/>
pickup, and eventually taken back to the shelf.<br/>
<br/>
That shelf is now in my sewing room, as we&#39;re in a bigger house and the kids <br/>
have their own rooms with other shelves and systems.<br/>
<br/>
We still have some of those boxes, or their successors, with the same stuff <br/>
in:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;the costume box&quot; (not lives on a really high shelf, but still comes down a <br/>
few times a year==Kirby mined it for pirate parts before the anime convention <br/>
last month)<br/>
<br/>
the dinosaur box (we pulled a two-headed dragon out of there as part of a <br/>
gift for a party Holly went to in August==it never was a dinosaur anyway, but it <br/>
was closer to that than other box-contents)<br/>
<br/>
The puppet box survives, still, full of hand puppets. It&#39;s in a shared <br/>
storage room, near the costumes.<br/>
<br/>
the doll box<br/>
<br/>
We have three boxes of &quot;McDonald toys&quot; now lidded and stacked.  We never used <br/>
to use lids on the shelf--I have another shelf in my office which was <br/>
designed to hold box lids, and I could sort projects so that I could clean and mess <br/>
up my desk with different sets of stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486483756">We have made a (very) little bit of progress.  I decided to tackle my office this weekend.  I moved a bunch of stuff out, then put things back where I wanted them, threw some stuff away, and have stuff to give away.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have the office be &quot;my&quot; room, but the girls want to have their desks in here too.  The room also has the hamsters, a piano and &quot;my&quot; computer.  (Gosh, I sound so greedy!)  Since there was so much room in here today, they both spent a bunch of time in here, but already it is messy again.  They did pick up some of it when I asked.  I did not say it, but I so felt like saying &quot;if you&#39;re going to have your stuff in my office then it has to always be kept clean!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Besides the girl&#39;s rooms, all the other rooms have furniture that my husband really loves and isn&#39;t willing to part with.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t pick it and due to sizes of furniture and shape of the house, I don&#39;t feel like I have too many options on how those rooms are furnished and arranged.  I did say something to Lisa about my wanting to feel like one room in the house is mine and she replied that I had my bedroom.  But it is one of the rooms that was arranged by dh for the most part.  It doesn&#39;t feel like &#39;my&#39; room.<br/>
<br/>
I had a conversation with dh about lightening up on the condition of the girl&#39;s rooms.  He doesn&#39;t go overboard with needing them super tidy, but hasn&#39;t bought into the idea of unchoring.  He thinks we need to &#39;teach&#39; them how to have their rooms a certain way.  He doesn&#39;t make time to help them though.  He thinks that is my job.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa and I have began to work on her room.  I gave her a box to store things that she doesn&#39;t use anymore but doesn&#39;t want to give away either.  She does want me to help and is usually willing to try different things.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie says she wants me to help, but poo poos just about every thing I suggest.  I had a couple extra storage cubes that I moved into her room, thinking that would be great for her stuffed animals.  She immediately saw how it could be a toy McDonalds!  I gotta love her imagination, but it ended up making her room more crowded rather than solving a storage problem.  Sigh....<br/>
