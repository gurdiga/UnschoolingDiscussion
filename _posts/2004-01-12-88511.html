When YOU feel that you are ready to have better handwriting, YOU will work to <br/>
make it better.  Maybe this will be the reason! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943390165">Spit, sputter, tu wee. You got me Kelly. LOL! I&#39;ve tryed calligraphy but<br/>
can&#39;t get the feel for the pen. I have a grip of death. ;-) I remember<br/>
writting in school and developing the callous I have on my finger. It was<br/>
torture. I should have gotten someones help at the conference when I had a<br/>
chance. Well I guess I could ask someone local but it just seems silly.<br/>
Everyone is *so* busy plus I don&#39;t know anyone that does Calligraphy.<br/>
Excuses. ;-)<br/>

Did someone already recommend a projector?<br/>
If you could rent one and copy your  quotes into nice fonts you could<br/>
project them on the walls and trace them. <br/>

I think I saw that on one of those decorating porn shows Kathryn likes so<br/>
well.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Block print them.<br/>
Get your kids to write them.<br/>
Ask guests who come to your house to write one.  <br/>

That way you&#39;ll have a variety of scripts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136006360">You could print out the quotes in different fonts and colors or on<br/>
different colored paper and decopage (sp?) them to the wall. It&#39;s easy and<br/>
cheap to do.<br/>
  :) Have fun! Jane<br/>
