<div id="ygrps-yiv-503544653">Can someone give me some good ideas on things to purchase for my 4 1/2<br/>
year old. He LOVES numbers, and is starting to put them together to see<br/>
what they make. It is so neat watching him figure these things out! He<br/>
is really into music, and he remembers the number of the song he likes<br/>
on almost every CD, even if he hasn&#39;t heard it for a month or so. That<br/>
amazes me!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709192168">How about lots of dice. Different kinds too the kind<br/>
gamers use that have more sides than your everyday 6<br/>
sided dice. Maybe dominoes...from my experience I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t play a game of dominoes with a 4 1/2 yo but I<br/>
would use them like a puzzle or seeing patterns. My dd<br/>
is 6 and we only just started Yahzee. <br/>
<br/>
She started exploring numbers at about the same age as<br/>
your son. Yesterday she was &#39;playing school&#39; with lego<br/>
children who each had their own cars. They must have<br/>
been having a math lesson because she kept asking me<br/>
what something plus something plus something was and I<br/>
would tell her. Then she would in a singsong like<br/>
teacher voice ask the student what something plus<br/>
something....was then the student would give the<br/>
correct answer :) <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I ever did anything special when she<br/>
started showing interest in numbers except answer her<br/>
question or give her hints that might work for her to<br/>
figure things out on her own. And her math concepts<br/>
have gotten more complex. <br/>
<br/>
Numbers and math is lots about finding and seeing<br/>
patterns. A game I really like for patterns is Rivers,<br/>
Rails and Roads. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977093036">Oh, we love Rivers, Roads & Rails!  I bought a brand-new game at a <br/>
garage sale for something like 50 cents years ago, and my sons and I <br/>
play it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend we discovered a game called Triaminoes, which is something <br/>
like Dominoes, except the pieces are triangles instead of being <br/>
rectangles.  It was challenging for the boys, but something they could <br/>
easily pick up if we play it just a few more times.  They really seemed <br/>
to enjoy it.  My husband and I loved it.  We plan to buy this game as a <br/>
Christmas present for the family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Money is great for kids learning about numbers.  Give him a small allowance <br/>
and help him figure out how long he&#39;d need to save for some small thing he <br/>
wants.  Play store with him using play or real money.  One good thing about <br/>
money is that it makes understanding borrowing and carrying easier.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to buy something, we used to have a plastic balance-type <br/>
scale.  The numbers were each a different size (and weight) so that a 3 and <br/>
a 5 will be the same weight as an 8 and balance out.<br/>
<br/>
Games like snakes and ladders are good for counting and figuring out what <br/>
you need to roll to land where you want to.  Talking about numbers you <br/>
encounter in daily life is great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916582262">In How Children Fail, John Holts first book, which began as a journal he<br/>
kept while working as a fifth-grade teacher and trying to analyze why the<br/>
kids seemed to have so much trouble understanding or retaining what he was<br/>
trying to teach them, there are pages and pages of his observations on kids<br/>
trying to figure out how a balance beam scale like that worked. (Well, the<br/>
scale he describes might have been more complicated  the thing he wanted<br/>
the kids to figure out was that things weigh more farther out  the<br/>
principle of the lever. The weights could be placed at varying distances<br/>
from the fulcrum.)<br/>
<br/>
In the original text, he describes how he and a colleague were trying to<br/>
help children develop their thinking skills, or some such rot. Then, in<br/>
the revised edition (in which he wisely changed nothing of his original<br/>
journal entries, but only added his new thoughts on them twenty or so years<br/>
later), he remarks that, after all the feverish effort he and his colleague<br/>
had put into these thinking games (with pretty dismal results), one day he<br/>
forgot and left the scale by accident on a table in the back of another<br/>
classroom, and guess what?<br/>
<br/>
Those kids figured it out on their own in no time, with no prodding,<br/>
hinting, encouragement, bribes or other manipulation. So I say, go ahead and<br/>
buy some stuff (I like Cuisenaire rods, too), but for goodness sake let<br/>
your kids play with it ON THEIR OWN.<br/>
<br/>
When kids (or adults) are too closely observed in their learning, they<br/>
become self-conscious. They feel judged, so they start focusing more of<br/>
their attention on not looking stupid than on actually solving the problem<br/>
in front of them. This destroys their intelligence.<br/>
