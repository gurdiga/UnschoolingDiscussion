&gt; I think I am finally understanding the group so much better.  It&#39;s like if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were a group about knitting, and someone who had not a clue wanted to join<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and kept interrupting with questions about how to buy yarn or what they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; even knit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s more like it&#39;s a group about knitting, and people are always<br/>
talking about what yarns are great and how they liked this or that pattern<br/>
and here&#39;s what works whether you&#39;re new or have been doing it forever, but<br/>
someone joins the list and says &quot;I&#39;m using bowling balls to knit with. I&#39;m<br/>
not ready to use knitting needles yet. The bowling balls are working fine.&quot;<br/>
And the knitters might say &quot;You know, knitting is never going to work really<br/>
well until you get rid of those bowling balls.&quot; And the newbie gets mad<br/>
because darn it, they really, really like those bowling balls, and they&#39;re<br/>
afraid to try knitting without them.<br/>
<br/>
Do whatever it takes to get rid of the bowling balls.<br/>
<br/>
In case my analogy wasn&#39;t clear, in the life of an unschooler, the bowling<br/>
balls are all those assumptions that most of us were taught in our schooled<br/>
upbringing -- kids have to be taught to learn, children aren&#39;t enthusiastic<br/>
about learning, externally imposed structure is necessary,<br/>
bribes/rewards/punishments work, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot knit until you ditch the bowling balls. Once you trade them for<br/>
some knitting needles (faith in your kids ability to learn from whatever<br/>
experiences they choose), the patterns look so much easier, the yarn starts<br/>
to flow through your fingers, and little by little you will knit!<br/>
