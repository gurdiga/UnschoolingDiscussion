<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981571865">I typed:<br/>
<br/>
How do you see it? Do you hear the tension being felt here? Is it <br/>
&quot;imposing on a child&quot; to say, &quot;We take care of each other&#39;s <br/>
posessions or you won&#39;t get to use them&quot;? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
I meant to type:<br/>
<br/>
I DON&#39;T think so. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s fine to set routines that help kids to fit in with a <br/>
household of people as long as we are being in dialog with <br/>
them and are aware of their feelings and contributions.<br/>
