<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376589080">So I enrolled my dd (6.5) in 4 classes this fall (she was interested <br/>
in all of them at the time). And we dropped all 4 because she didn&#39;t <br/>
want to go back.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I told people about the classes--a few of these people <br/>
aren&#39;t too keen on homeschooling. I thought, foolishly, I would tell <br/>
them about it to show that we are (dd is) &quot;doing&quot; something with our <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we are home once again most of the time because dd doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to get out too much (though we try to a few times a week, and go home <br/>
when she&#39;s ready for the most part).  And she&#39;s not fond of having <br/>
new friends over and figuring out those dynamics (she has a schooled <br/>
neighbor friend she is comfortable playing with).  She really does <br/>
enjoy having most of her time spent with our family, and <br/>
independently.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying a family Spanish class today taught by the adult son of <br/>
my unschooling friend.  Family classes sound like something I&#39;m going <br/>
to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
She is also considered shy around people she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
around (she is not at all shy with us, her family or her good buddy <br/>
or some of our extended family).  There&#39;s a part of me that is <br/>
nervous that other people, especially extended family, will think <br/>
that I need to get her out more in order for her to &quot;get over&quot; this <br/>
shyness (or socialization)--a belief that I have heard but don&#39;t <br/>
agree with.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 3 year old dd.  It seems like our day goes by really <br/>
quickly by the time I get food for the kids (several times a day), <br/>
clean up the kitchen, do laundry, email a bit, answer kids&#39; <br/>
questions, wipe butts, and so on.  I feel guilty that I&#39;m not giving <br/>
dd1 much for project and/or reading time which she really loves.  <br/>
Although for the most part she keeps really busy during the day with <br/>
her own inventions and playing with dd2.  And both really seem to be <br/>
thriving.<br/>
<br/>
I have a large homeschooling group in my area, we are still meeting <br/>
at a great park (until November 1st, then indoors).  Dd1 doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to go.  If we go, I mostly hear whining about wanting to go home <br/>
(mostly from dd1).  So now I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s best to not go right <br/>
now.  But I sure do love the adult contact.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to make peace with this so if/when people ask about the <br/>
classes or ask questions about what we do, I can be okay with their <br/>
questions. And also I wonder why I can&#39;t seem to get myself focused <br/>
enough to do the one-on-one reading time, etc. my kids really love <br/>
during the day (we do read at night if we get in bed early enough).  <br/>
I do think it&#39;s really important for me to be okay with <br/>
myself/accepting because then I feel much better, and am much <br/>
happier.  But I do wonder if there is something I&#39;m just not <br/>
understanding about all this.<br/>
<br/>
My mantra lately is &quot;We&#39;re always learning!&quot;  and that is helping me <br/>
so much. I&#39;m also reading &quot;Deschooling Our Lives&quot; which makes me feel <br/>
like our unschooling choice is pretty much a no-brainer.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has any comments about this.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

I&#39;ve seen Marty get better over time, and can remember a few times in  <br/>
the past when Marty was trapped in a social situation too close, too  <br/>
long and reacted badly.  He still needs more time alone than my other  <br/>

before that he hung back quite a bit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My almost 6yo d. surprised us this week.  She has always been <br/>
considered shy by most people save the few she &quot;let in&quot; to her circle <br/>
of comfort.  She is VERY small for her age...she is about 3 feet 5&quot; <br/>
and only weighs 34 pounds.  She is very flexible and is always <br/>
flipping and flopping, spending great deals of time upside down or <br/>
sprawled like road kill.  My next two older children have been very <br/>
active in theatre, my 15 yo d. is planning on a career in theatre <br/>
actually, so my almost 6 yo decided she was going to audtion for the <br/>
part of Tiny Tim at our university theatre dept here for their <br/>
production of Christmas Carol.  We were all concenered that she would <br/>
just freeze up.  The day of the auditions she asked quite worried if <br/>
a certain boy from our town who had an arm amputated a few years back <br/>
would be at the auditions.  She is TERRIFIED by his lack of a <br/>
forarm.  I have tried to talk with her about it but she just begins <br/>
to cry and shake and demand to leave where ever we are.  This has <br/>
meant leaaving the public pool, the library, a friends party etc.  I <br/>
told here he wouldn&#39;t likely be there because he was older and would <br/>
be in the next audition time...all was going well when, in he <br/>
walked.  She grabbed me and started shaking and ssaying I can&#39;t do <br/>
this this take me home etc.   The theatre people thought she was just <br/>
suddenly scared about the audition. I calmed her down enough that she <br/>
would let a friend hold her off where she couldn&#39;t see the boy and <br/>
quickly explained the situation to the director&#39;s assistant.  I then <br/>
went to my daughter and asked if she really wanted to leave, because <br/>
I was not going to be able arrange for any other options for the <br/>
audition.  She was still very upset but said she HAD to audition and <br/>
what should she do?  I suggested she could let two of her homeschool <br/>
older friends hold her hands in and then sit where she couldn&#39;t see <br/>
the boy...she carried on back and forth for wveral minutes that she <br/>
couldn&#39;t do this but she HAd to She really wanted to be Tiny Tim she <br/>
finnally went in and a short while later the assistant came ot to <br/>
tell me she was doing fine (No parents allowed in auditions)  She <br/>
came out a while later, being carried by one of her friends.  She <br/>
said she had done ok but had been TOO SHY to sing the song she had <br/>
rehearsed...We ifgure that was the end of that when she said on of <br/>
the other little girls had song a nice song...next day we get the <br/>
call that she was cast!!  She da been the only child that would allow <br/>
Scrooge to pick her up and flip her on to his shoulders.   She <br/>
had&#39;n&#39;t told us that!  She said well that wasn&#39;t scary that was just <br/>
fun, I got to ride up on his shoulders and flip up and down.   I <br/>
realize this has been long bo my point is what has been viewed as <br/>
weak points by many was the strong points that got her the role...Her <br/>
size that of a small three yo was a plus for the charecter, her <br/>
fondness for cavorting through space landed her fearless on Scrooge&#39;s <br/>
shoulders and her over coming the problem with the bot impresses the <br/>
director and they thought she could over come stage freight...even if <br/>
she couldn&#39;t sing at the audition...She did cause she really wnted <br/>
it.  Beverly</div>

While it&#39;s great that she was cast, what if this boy is cast too?   <br/>
But even if he&#39;s not, it seems your daughter could use some serious  <br/>
eye-to-eye about her reaction.  Have you talked to her about how she  <br/>
would feel if something happened to you, or her, or (I don&#39;t know who  <br/>
you could name) and you were missing part of a hand or a leg (I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t make a direct parallel) and people wanted to run away  <br/>
instead of being nice?<br/>
<br/>
Would it help to find photos of amputees?  There&#39;s a dog born with no  <br/>
forelegs that walks on hind legs.  There&#39;s a youTube video.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t overwhelm her with such photos, but some desensitization  <br/>
seems to be a good plan under the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you know someone (or could call the humane society or a vet  <br/>
or something) with a three-legged dog, she could meet the dog and pet  <br/>
it and touch the place and hear the story, and realize that of course  <br/>
the dog would be better off with four legs, but has learned to  <br/>
compensate, and is alive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve tried all that.  But all other things being equal, if  <br/>
the boy is cast in the play, will your daughter drop out?  Will he  <br/>
discover the reason?<br/>
<br/>
(You don&#39;t need to tell us, I&#39;m just putting those things out for you  <br/>
to think about, which you might already have done.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-682519832">In addition to the shy part (which I think of as withdrawing into  <br/>
myself) I can also get reactive. I lose my center and start making  <br/>
demands of her (to calm down, breathe, leave, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
So, I need some help for me and for her in these situations.<br/>
<br/>
As my dd&#39;s gotten older, she has found a great deal of joy at home  <br/>
playing World of Warcraft, posting on deviantArt, reading, sculpting  <br/>
in clay, playing her DS or Wii. I&#39;m perfectly happy for her to be  <br/>
here. She rides horses, too, and interacts well with other people there.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, she has sought social experiences or said yes to some  <br/>
suggestions of mine. But, at 13, things can still go off the rails for  <br/>
her quickly in a social circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
She says she wants to be in the situation, looks forward to it, has  <br/>
plans of how to handle things if it&#39;s difficult, but has expectations  <br/>
of how things will go, even if I try to prepare her for possibilities.  <br/>
When her expectations are not realized, or she&#39;s not prepared for some  <br/>
kind of interaction, she can get pretty agitated. And it can happen in  <br/>
a flash.<br/>
<br/>
If I can catch the moment just before the tipping point, I can make a  <br/>
difference. But if I don&#39;t and she&#39;s gone from irritated to melt-down  <br/>
*now,* I have found it hard to help her. She&#39;s likely to tune me out  <br/>
completely and push me away, especially if I try to guide her  <br/>
physically to a &quot;safe place&quot; (somewhere out of the situation for her  <br/>
to regain her composure). I try not to talk to her too much, because  <br/>
she can&#39;t process what I&#39;m saying when she&#39;s feeling that overwhelmed.  <br/>
But, sometimes, I get agitated, too.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried, as suggested by an unschooling friend, to devise with  <br/>
her a signal that will help her to know when to take a break, go for a  <br/>
walk, remove herself from the situation. She doesn&#39;t seem particularly  <br/>
open to my managing this - in other words, I feel as if she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want me to identify when *I* think it&#39;s time to take a break.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t as hard when she was little to scoop her up and find  <br/>
something more fun to do. But, now, she&#39;s bigger, strong and  <br/>
defensive. She also doesn&#39;t want me hanging around all the time. She  <br/>
seems to *want* to negotiate these deep waters for herself, even if  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t yet have the skills to swim in them.<br/>
<br/>
I want to give her space, yet I want to protect her (and others, if  <br/>
necessary). And I want to increase the trust between us that I&#39;m there  <br/>
to help, not hinder her.<br/>
<br/>
Advice and insight appreciated.<br/>

Coach during practices and allow the players to play the game  <br/>

<br/>
That is my husband&#39;s soccer coaching strategy - he says coaches should  <br/>
not be coaching DURING a game, that&#39;s what practices are for. He is an  <br/>
extraordinarily successful coach - the teams are always divided up so  <br/>
that they are level in terms of player abilities. In our region they  <br/>
go to great lengths to even out the teams. But his teams win and win  <br/>
and win - season after season for the past 13 or so years this has  <br/>
been true. And they win at tournaments, too. During games he organizes  <br/>
the line-up, talks to the players beforehand and during half time and  <br/>
afterward, but he doesn&#39;t shout out at the players telling them what  <br/>
to do during the game, like all other coaches do. I think this has far- <br/>
reaching effects on the players - they don&#39;t rely on the coach, they  <br/>
aren&#39;t always thinking about what the coach wants, they&#39;re more &quot;in&quot;  <br/>
the game, less distracted, more able to try out things that they think  <br/>
of themselves. He doesn&#39;t criticize their decisions during the game,  <br/>
later. THEY talk about what went well and what didn&#39;t - but the &quot;what  <br/>
didn&#39;t&quot; comes from them, not him.<br/>

talking about what she can do, prior to social situations. I *do*  <br/>
write her letters, though, because she can read them at her leisure  <br/>
and mull them over. She does want to get better. She just doesn&#39;t want  <br/>

accurately...I have 3 kids, 7,5 and 3 and we own a farm so add in farm<br/>
work to the equation....I don&#39;t have much time to facilitate learning,<br/>
and when I do they&#39;re building lego or busy with something or other,<br/>
which is the point, I know, but I feel like I&#39;m failing....I&#39;m still<br/>
in that mindset that I need to do &quot;something&quot;  I try and read to them<br/>
for at least an hour a day, that is a successful day for me, but some<br/>
days it doesn&#39;t happen (today it did yay!)    I wonder how other<br/>
mothers who work in the home do it or do anything, it feels like I<br/>
never stop moving.......and my house is still a disaster ;)<br/>

&gt; I also have a 3 year old dd. It seems like our day goes by really<br/>
&gt; quickly by the time I get food for the kids (several times a day),<br/>
&gt; clean up the kitchen, do laundry, email a bit, answer kids&#39;<br/>
&gt; questions, wipe butts, and so on. I feel guilty that I&#39;m not giving<br/>
&gt; dd1 much for project and/or reading time which she really loves.<br/>
&gt; Although for the most part she keeps really busy during the day with<br/>
&gt; her own inventions and playing with dd2. And both really seem to be<br/>
&gt; thriving.<br/>

her a pep talk before hand: Hey, what a fun time you&#39;re going to have!  <br/>
You feel so good about yourself, who you are--strong, capable.  Have a <br/>
great time!  And that&#39;s it.  Stay out of the way.  Don&#39;t talk about it <br/>
afterwards, unless she comes to you. And then just listen. If she asks <br/>
questions, keep your answers short and positive.<br/>
<br/>
Give her the opportunity / the freedom to be a different person than <br/>
she was when she was younger, than she was last week, yesterday, an <br/>
hour ago. And you can do this by thinking and feeling different <br/>
thoughts about her (thoughts about her inner strength, etc.)<br/>

The Joy of NOT Being Known<br/>
by Scott Noelle, posted on 2006-06-15<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we connected with the joy of being known. However, not being <br/>
known can be a good thing, too  it gives you space to re-create <br/>
yourself every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
A parent&#39;s &quot;knowing&quot; can have the unintended effect of suppressing <br/>
growth and learning: &quot;Don&#39;t give my son any broccoli  he hates it!&quot; <br/>
Who&#39;s to say he won&#39;t develop a taste for broccoli today?<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself using labels (e.g., &quot;fussy eater&quot;) you <br/>
definitely &quot;know&quot; too much about your child!<br/>
<br/>
Today, continue connecting with what you know about your child, but <br/>
also be willing to let go of everything you know and allow a new truth <br/>
to be born.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I try not to go into specific possibilities. I don&#39;t how things  <br/>
will go!  I have given her some ways to handle her feelings, but I  <br/>
think she&#39;s been hearing it as a lecture.  On occasion, I&#39;ve mentioned  <br/>
that someone with whom she&#39;s had difficulty before will be there,  <br/>
which may have set her up for anxiety for no good reason.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sometimes a fine line between saying nothing that might upset her  <br/>
ahead of time and saying the wrong thing. Pep talks have fallen into  <br/>
that &quot;wrong thing&quot; category for her. It&#39;s another way for me to  <br/>
dismiss *her* thoughts about it.<br/>

absorb in her own time. She&#39;s maturing, so I think it&#39;s making more  <br/>
sense to her now that being flexible can be a better strategy.<br/>

Tears come, but anger and &quot;stuck-ness&quot; are more likely at first. She  <br/>
does withdraw and keep her innermost feelings to herself. I wonder if  <br/>
the anger is a protection of sorts?<br/>

something that embarrasses her, her anxiety increases. But she seems  <br/>

times or so. And I get a lot out of his writings, and have a lot of <br/>
respect for his advice, gentleness, and openness.  So I was surprised <br/>
to read on this list that he was badmouthing anyone.  I asked him <br/>
about it. I think the comments made here could have had an impact on <br/>
his home business which supports his family so they can stay home <br/>
together, so I&#39;m posting his response:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was apparently referring to comments I made during one of my <br/>
presentations at the California homeschooling conference in <br/>
Sacramento, last August. I didn&#39;t see Sandra at the conference, so I&#39;m<br/>
guessing she heard about my comments from _[I&#39;m removing her name <br/>
here]__, who was there, and with whom I had a long, constructive <br/>
conversation about it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an audio excerpt from that presentation, called &quot;Transcending <br/>
the &#39;Un&#39; in Unschooling,&quot; which includes my brief comment about <br/>
unschooling lists *in general*. You can judge for yourself if I was<br/>
&quot;badmouthing&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
www.scottnoelle.com/files/unschooling-correctness.mp3<br/>
<br/>
A major theme of the talk was how rule-based, right/wrong thinking <br/>
permeates our society (including the school system), and one way that<br/>
orientation shows up in the unschooling movement is in the form <br/>
of &quot;unschooling correctness.&quot; Pam helped me see that it goes both <br/>
ways on unschooling lists -- that often the &quot;victim&quot; has perceived a<br/>
constructive criticism as shaming. Either way, it&#39;s the mode of <br/>
thinking I was criticizing, not the people who engage in it (which is <br/>
*all* of us, to varying degrees and in a variety of ways). I wasn&#39;t<br/>
making anyone out to be bad; nothing is more natural than to pick up <br/>
the patterns of one&#39;s own culture.<br/>
<br/>
But for me unschooling is an act of cultural creativity, and in my <br/>
experience political correctness hinders that creative process.<br/>

I haven&#39;t listened to the clip yet, but I hope when you wrote to  <br/>
Scott you sent my whole post, where I had already made clear that I  <br/>
didn&#39;t know if it was this list, and that I wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to discuss people who are selling unschooling and  <br/>
mindful parenting information here.  There&#39;s no need.  The list isn&#39;t  <br/>
for that.  It&#39;s for discussing unschooling directly.  Citing someone  <br/>
is fine, but disputing points with quotes from people who aren&#39;t here  <br/>
and who don&#39;t help other people freely isn&#39;t what the list is about.<br/>

transcribing it and discussing it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.   I was put<br/>
off by the comments, but it is good to have heard them first hand.<br/>
<br/>
Are these, in fact, the comments that were considered badmouthing this<br/>
list or was there more that isn&#39;t included in that clip?<br/>

&gt;&gt; The author of the quote is a pep-talkin&#39; guy, but he badmouthed<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt;&gt; list (some thought; could&#39;ve been another list, but it&#39;s as<br/>
&gt;&gt; irritating even if it was another one) in a public speech.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know Scott a little bit as we have talked on the phone around 10<br/>
&gt; times or so. And I get a lot out of his writings, and have a lot of<br/>
&gt; respect for his advice, gentleness, and openness. So I was surprised<br/>
&gt; to read on this list that he was badmouthing anyone. I asked him<br/>
&gt; about it. I think the comments made here could have had an impact on<br/>
&gt; his home business which supports his family so they can stay home<br/>
&gt; together, so I&#39;m posting his response:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra was apparently referring to comments I made during one of my<br/>
&gt; presentations at the California homeschooling conference in<br/>
&gt; Sacramento, last August. I didn&#39;t see Sandra at the conference, so I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; guessing she heard about my comments from _[I&#39;m removing her name<br/>
&gt; here]__, who was there, and with whom I had a long, constructive<br/>
&gt; conversation about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an audio excerpt from that presentation, called &quot;Transcending<br/>
&gt; the &#39;Un&#39; in Unschooling,&quot; which includes my brief comment about<br/>
&gt; unschooling lists *in general*. You can judge for yourself if I was<br/>
&gt; &quot;badmouthing&quot;...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; www.scottnoelle.com/files/unschooling-correctness.mp3<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A major theme of the talk was how rule-based, right/wrong thinking<br/>
&gt; permeates our society (including the school system), and one way that<br/>
&gt; orientation shows up in the unschooling movement is in the form<br/>
&gt; of &quot;unschooling correctness.&quot; Pam helped me see that it goes both<br/>
&gt; ways on unschooling lists -- that often the &quot;victim&quot; has perceived a<br/>
&gt; constructive criticism as shaming. Either way, it&#39;s the mode of<br/>
&gt; thinking I was criticizing, not the people who engage in it (which is<br/>
&gt; *all* of us, to varying degrees and in a variety of ways). I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; making anyone out to be bad; nothing is more natural than to pick up<br/>
&gt; the patterns of one&#39;s own culture.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But for me unschooling is an act of cultural creativity, and in my<br/>
&gt; experience political correctness hinders that creative process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22877476">I was only there for part of that talk, because it felt like being at a talk given by any of the countless people who come to this list and talk about how they unschool everything except ........  I found the talk, in general, to be more &quot;un&quot; than anything, and not helpful, in my mind, in moving toward actual unschooling.  The part I heard was fairly negative and critical in the broadest sense--not promoting anything positive, just dissing the &quot;dogma&quot; of unschooling, which is why his comments about lists and yahoo groups packed a little more punch when taken in the whole context.  There was no understanding or acknowledgement expressed that, like trying to learn any new system, you have to adopt a certain amount of dogma to &quot;try it on&quot; and find what fits, and figure out what people are talking about.  Most people move past that stage and become more creative with it as they internalize it, but it is a valid stage of learning.<br/>
<br/>
What I found lacking were what I have considered to be some key components that this list has helped me to develop, like TRUST.  There was, yet again, lots of talk of trusting ourselves as parents, and, yet again, very little talk about trusting our children.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time in my unschooling journey, when I was not able to trust, that I was also very concerned with other people judging me.  It doesn&#39;t mean that they were, but I was concerned with it.  Now that I have found how to have a true connection with my children that is not based on a power differential, I am much more concerned with that relationship.  The questions about &quot;how to do it right&quot; have melted away.  But it took time and searching to find that place, and if someone hasn&#39;t truly found that place, yet is attempting to speak to audiences and advise people for money, then they may feel like they have a lot to be defensive about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - removed my name from that paragraph but used it later. That&#39;s  <br/>
okay. I did talk to Sandra about it and also as much as I could  <br/>
remember about the lengthy and constructive talk Scott and I had,  <br/>
later, too.<br/>
<br/>
What I understood from Scott was that he&#39;d read archives of an  <br/>
unspecified unschooling list(s) and felt that people were being  <br/>
pressured to unschool correctly and follow certain rules of  <br/>
unschooling. He felt that people were being told things like &quot;you&#39;re  <br/>
doing it wrong&quot; and &quot;here is how to do it right&quot; and &quot;it is only right  <br/>
if you do it my way.&quot; He was warning them off of that kind of right  <br/>
and wrong thinking and warning them not to jump from the &quot;box&quot; of  <br/>
school thinking to another &quot;box&quot; of unschooling correctness.<br/>
<br/>
There is an aspect of this point that I completely agree with. People  <br/>
often come to the unschooling lists and want our approval; they want  <br/>
to know if they are &quot;doing it right.&quot; I am with Scott 100 percent in  <br/>
encouraging those people to STOP seeking approval, stop trying to fit  <br/>
in, don&#39;t make their own journey about following someone else&#39;s rules  <br/>
or principles. Instead, make it all about gaining deeper understanding  <br/>
of what is best for your own children.<br/>
<br/>
So far so good, I think.<br/>
<br/>
What I was unhappy about was not the above message.<br/>
<br/>
What I objected to was people being warned away from the unschooling  <br/>
lists where I believe they have the best chance of truly doing that  <br/>
sometimes very hard work of letting go of their own &quot;shoulds&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;musts&quot; and &quot;have to&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The example Scott gave in his talk was that if you go to these lists  <br/>
and mention limiting screen time that you&#39;ll get flamed.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is what I referred to as badmouthing the lists. Flaming is NOT a  <br/>
nice thing to be accused of at all. People who are &quot;flaming&quot; are being  <br/>
hostile and insulting, not constructive or clarifying, and an  <br/>
accusation of &quot;flaming&quot; is badmouthing.<br/>
<br/>
What happens on the unschooling lists is nothing like flaming.<br/>
<br/>
What happens on these lists is that people&#39;s ideas and beliefs are  <br/>
most definitely challenged. That is the very purpose OF the lists. To  <br/>
characterize that as &quot;flaming&quot; is a very strong and very negative  <br/>
judgment and I was quite upset by it (I was in the audience).<br/>
<br/>
Later that evening I expressed my objections to Scott (and I want to  <br/>
say clearly that Scott listened carefully and I felt like we  <br/>
communicated well). We talked for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I felt that Scott, like others, did not understand the nature and  <br/>
purpose of the lists. While I believe he is correct that there are  <br/>
people who DO want to jump out of the schooling box and into another  <br/>
one, I don&#39;t think it is the lists that are to blame for that or that  <br/>
the lists pressure people into that. It is the people coming to the  <br/>
lists already WANTING and seeking membership in the &quot;unschooling club&quot;  <br/>
who end up hurt and upset because what happens on these lists is that,  <br/>
instead of feeling welcomed into that new unschooling box, their ideas  <br/>
are challenged and critiqued.<br/>
<br/>
Do people experience discomfort at having their ideas held up to a  <br/>
bright light and carefully and critically scrutinized? Some people  <br/>
find it painful and others find it exhilarating. It definitely isn&#39;t  <br/>
everyone&#39;s cup of tea.<br/>
<br/>
Scott had said in his talk that they limit &quot;screen time.&quot; I told Scott  <br/>
that I think it is insulting to the kids to use the term &#39;screen time&#39;  <br/>
and lump together all the different things they might do that involve  <br/>
tv, video games, or computers. He disagreed and said he thought screen  <br/>
time was something those activities all had in common. I didn&#39;t argue.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t argue. I didn&#39;t get the feeling he thought he&#39;d just been  <br/>
&quot;flamed&quot; - I got the feeling that he absolutely knew that I&#39;d just  <br/>
offered him something, based on my own understanding and experience,  <br/>
that I thought might be useful for him to consider.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t make any difference in my family if Scott&#39;s family limits  <br/>
what he calls screen time. We will continue to sit in our living room,  <br/>
all together, with our laptops, while we watch Project Runway or the  <br/>
Vice Presidential debates or a British soccer game or all KINDS of  <br/>
other shows, and we&#39;ll pause the DVR so we can talk and look things up  <br/>
on google and laugh and learn together. I have NOTHING to gain by  <br/>
convincing Scott to think my way about tv, video games, or computer  <br/>
use. His kids are still young and I know he&#39;s still interested and  <br/>
open-minded and willing to listen to alternative ideas, so I offered  <br/>
him that one. A freebie &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
That is very typical of the kind of interaction that gets taken by  <br/>
some people as us trying to impose &quot;unschooling correctness,&quot; as Scott  <br/>
called it. I don&#39;t think Scott took it that way, and I think/hope that  <br/>
he came to understand that this was a problem that people were  <br/>
bringing with them to the lists, not having it imposed on them there.  <br/>
Because HE wasn&#39;t worried, himself, about fitting into someone else&#39;s  <br/>
definition of unschoolling, I think he took my comments exactly as  <br/>
intended. I hope that made it more clear to him what is actually going  <br/>
on when people do take such comments the wrong way.<br/>

<br/>
There are a few male humans to whom I believe that applies.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s family is really truly unschooling full on and  <br/>
gloriously, then I don&#39;t care if the mom or dad or both is charging  <br/>
to counsel families (especially not if one is &quot;a real counsellor&quot; of  <br/>
one sort or another anyway).  I think it&#39;s a little more questionable  <br/>
when one charges serious money to speak and to do phone counselling  <br/>
but  his own unschooling is spotty or compromised.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can talk about the principle without naming names.  Do your  <br/>
own exploring and deciding.<br/>
If you&#39;re running a conference, PLEASE check in advance to see  <br/>
whether the people can actually do the thing they&#39;re promoting.  If  <br/>
you&#39;re running a conference, please lean more toward personal  <br/>
experience that will be freely shared than the stringing together of  <br/>
truisms lifted from the larger body of the parenting knowledge that  <br/>
has been building up over the past few decades, especially when it  <br/>
involves someone who isn&#39;t willing to share freely about his own  <br/>
personal successes with parenting and unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065912861">This is all so interesting... pulling things out into the open.  Shedding<br/>
more light on my own thinking about these things.<br/>
<br/>
I must be some sort of philosophical omnivore.  I love to incorporate<br/>
anything that feeds my unschooling journey, that I find useful.  I have<br/>
gleaned from Scott&#39;s excellent wording of the parenting situation many<br/>
times.  And more times than I can count, I&#39;ve done the same on unschooling<br/>
lists for about 4 years now, maybe longer.  Yet I&#39;m not loyal to either<br/>
one.  This is my life and I can choose to ditch one or both or to keep<br/>
both.  We all decide what we think about correctness as we go along.  No one<br/>
has to say anything about it.  It happens on its own.<br/>
<br/>
My point in this post is that I appreciate the philosophical diversity.<br/>
It&#39;s like the chicken and egg .... which came first?  You can trace a good<br/>
bit back to any number of other philosophies and philosophers.  Many<br/>
unschooling lists refer to John Holt.  And John Holt is not a sudden<br/>
development that came sprang nowhere himself.  The roots go far back and<br/>
long ago, getting more and more lost to antiquity every year.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that the ecology of it is important.  Philosophies come and go,<br/>
and find their uses where they are relevant to the surrounding culture.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure John Holt is one of the major culmination points in the ecology of<br/>
educational philosophies.  Instead of seeing ourselves in a mirror and<br/>
walking away forgetful of what we&#39;ve seen (like schoolthink does, which<br/>
can&#39;t draw much from unschooling), parents can directly experience what Holt<br/>
alluded to by unschooling their children.  A fantastic privilege and<br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Holt&#39;s work *supports* a variety of similar thoughts as well as diverging<br/>
ones.  Other&#39;s ideation sometimes is *supported* and other times pulled from<br/>
the roots to plant something else as a result of coming into contact with<br/>
the varied thoughts and ideas from Holt&#39;s &quot;pollenation,&quot; philosophical<br/>
speaking.  This construction and destruction is a natural process of the<br/>
thought life in various &quot;ecologies&quot; to form the philosophical structure.<br/>
<br/>
Many converging and diverging philosophies build and pull down parts in my<br/>
own thinking.  When I agree, great.. it builds something for me.  When I<br/>
disagree, great .... at some point, the disagreement comes back around full<br/>
circle to eventual agreement (partially or in full) or it creates more (or<br/>
duplicates) clarity on the thinking I already had.  Either way, I am<br/>
deciding what&#39;s relevant to me, and passing some on for consideration by<br/>
others in my family and among my friends.  We are choosing our support<br/>
systems as we go, and in the same process, we are our own greatest supporter<br/>
of our own personal growth.  Even when we don&#39;t know it, and even when it<br/>
doesn&#39;t benefit us the way we&#39;d like it to.<br/>
<br/>
I have found in unschooling lists possibly the greatest benefactor of the<br/>
happiness I&#39;m building in the life of my family.  On the lists, I can potter<br/>
through scads of ideas the way I can&#39;t in real life.  It&#39;s like a lab in a<br/>
course for personal growth tailor-made for me, in which I get to form up the<br/>
hypotheses and test on my own and I don&#39;t have to report anything to<br/>
anybody.  It&#39;s just for me.  (Pottering, like Harry.)<br/>
