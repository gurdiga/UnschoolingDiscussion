<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020522717">Hi, Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
Hope allis well with you and yours.  Do you remember that essay we talked<br/>
about a couple of months ago for the book I&#39;m working on?  Well, it&#39;s time<br/>
to get down to business.  Thanks to my finding another potential<br/>
contributor, I&#39;ve actually now put together some guidelines and will send<br/>
them out to 3 other people (I&#39;m thinking about saving one of the essays for<br/>
me &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
So, this is what we&#39;re looking at:<br/>
<br/>
500 - 750 words (briefer, of course, is better)<br/>
This will be in the last chapter of the book (besides resources)<br/>
<br/>
Chapter Title:  AFTER YOUR FIRST YEAR<br/>
First Chapter Subtitle:  Homeschooling Benefits You May Notice<br/>
Second Chapter Subtitle:  Benefits You May *Not* Notice Right Away (aka A<br/>
Few Things the Education Establishment Would Rather You Didn&#39;t Know About<br/>
Homeschooling)<br/>
<br/>
This is where you come in, because this subtitle will be composed of an<br/>
intro and 5 essays.  Think about what you feel is an important benefit<br/>
that, well, the ed establishment would rather folks didn&#39;t know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please send me an email with what will be the theme of your particular<br/>
piece, only so I can avoid the slight possibility of duplication.<br/>
<br/>
Prima is willing to pay $100 to each essayist.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think!<br/>

<br/>
Is this an invitation to write an essay for Lisa alone, or are all members<br/>
of the unschooling list invited to contribute?<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in writing something for this, but would like to make<br/>
certain my essay is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Also, may a contributor write an essay for each chapter subtitle, or only<br/>
one?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not...I sure will let you know when another need pops up -<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a matter of time!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for expressing your interest (and to all others who did<br/>
the same).<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
