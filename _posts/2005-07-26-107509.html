 </span></blockquote>I must say, though, not of 13 year olds but of younger kids, there were a <br/>
couple of Holly-friends who would call and attempt to plan a get-together, but <br/>
they had NO real information and no answers to any of our questions so it just <br/>
didn&#39;t work, and I would just about every time get on the phone and ask to talk <br/>
to her mom.  If the mom had said &quot;Ask if Holly can come over tomorrow to swim <br/>
in the afternoon and we can pick her up,&quot; that would&#39;ve been fine.    But it <br/>
was &quot;Holly, do you want to come over tomorrow?&quot;   And that inviter had not a <br/>
single answer to what time or how or how long or what are we going to do.   Two <br/>
different families.   The mom might&#39;ve thought she was &quot;teaching&quot; the child <br/>
to use the phone or to make her own arrangements, but the result was that we <br/>
were frustrated and that child was not experiencing confidence or <br/>
accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in such a family the child will go no further in planning than to say <br/>
&quot;Do you want to go to the mall?&quot;    And then the rest of the trip to the mall <br/>
might unfold roughly (like they don&#39;t get there in time for a movie, or have to <br/>
be back before it would end, or whatever).   And maybe those parents know <br/>
their child is incapable of planning something smoothly, but it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
because of age, it would more likely be because the child wasn&#39;t used to having <br/>
someone more experienced ask the right questions for years before they were 13.<br/>
<br/>
Any of my kids have been able to for years plan an outing, with times and <br/>
travel times and how much money they&#39;ll need, but maybe it&#39;s partly modelling and <br/>
maybe it&#39;s partly coaching and SURELY it&#39;s partly genetics.   Keith and I <br/>
were first drawn to each other because of singing and organizational ability, and <br/>
we have singing, organizing kids.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s first serious interest in me came from my having organized a bus trip <br/>
for 25 people to Houston.   Not a charter trip; that&#39;s easy.   A schoolbus, <br/>
bought, repainted, equipped, and the route planned (there&#39;s not an easy route <br/>
from Albuquerque to Houston) food on the way (some meals from coolers and one <br/>
stop a day at an all-you-can eat place)...   He rode back with us, but had <br/>
flown out. I was 24 years old.    <br/>
<br/>
I was 24, so does that mean 24 year olds can organize group outings?   <br/>
Holly is 13 and can organize outings, but does that mean 13 year olds CAN <br/>
organize outings?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about age.   Rules about ages will always miss.   I was not allowed <br/>
to date until I was 15.   Some 15 year olds have already sneaked off and done <br/>
their worst under unsanitary conditions.   Some are not ready to date at 15.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Rules over principles are bad because they don&#39;t allow people to develop at <br/>
their own rate and for things to be done for reasons of desire and readiness <br/>
and maturity.<br/>
<br/>
Principles over rules, though, when the people in the situations don&#39;t have <br/>
or understand principles, results in a mess of nothing useful.   And so while <br/>
it&#39;s ideal for people to live by principles, maybe in some families the <br/>
principle is that all that works for them are rules and ages because they don&#39;t <br/>
understand any   other way.<br/>
<br/>
This rolls back onto the question of whether anyone can unschool.   <br/>
I don&#39;t suppose they can, if they don&#39;t have the ability to stop and wonder <br/>
what it would be, and see several ways in which they might contribute <br/>
positively to it right then, and to also see what the roadblocks are in their own lives <br/>
and to have some idea how to disassemble those or avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about being a certain age, it&#39;s something else.<br/>
