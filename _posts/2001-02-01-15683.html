<br>
<br>That&#39;s nice to read, since last night I got long, private e-mail from somone 
<br>on this list telling me I needed professional counseling and drugs to get 
<br>over my problems with religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>If anyone here doesn&#39;t believe that the Catholics and the Baptist 
<br>convention(s) have official doctrines, just go to the internet. &nbsp;If my 
<br>stating real, plain (simple, not even fancy or obscure) fact makes me mean or 
<br>crazy in the eyes of some people, it says more about those people who are 
<br>disturbed than about me. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>One of the things most central to learning / education is critical thinking, 
<br>and without some serious consideration of what truth means, what &quot;real&quot; is, 
<br>what&#39;s important or powerful and what isn&#39;t, there can&#39;t be honest inquiry. &nbsp;
<br>I don&#39;t mean wallow in the basest, most depressing of all reality. &nbsp;I don&#39;t 
<br>mean living with the homeless and shooting smack (although that&#39;s reality for 
<br>some people). &nbsp;But the opposite of that is a la-la pretension that all 
<br>people&#39;s beliefs are equally good and right; that big, organized religions 
<br>aren&#39;t oppressive or controlling; that &quot;pro-life&quot; isn&#39;t a gigantic movement 
<br>designed to make abortion illegal for any and all, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;Saying things that 
<br>aren&#39;t true just in hopes that it will make them true isn&#39;t a good basis for 
<br>unschooling, thought, or life.
<br>
<br>Looking and thinking are good and right things. &nbsp;
<br>Covering your ears and saying &quot;You&#39;re MEAN&quot; when someone points out another 
<br>point of view shows an immaturity of thought and awareness. &nbsp;(Is it mean for 
<br>me to write that? &nbsp;Can we nice one another into a happy mush of la-la 
<br>ignorance? &nbsp;Is happiness better than awareness? &nbsp;To some extent, maybe so.)
