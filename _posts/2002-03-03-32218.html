<div id="ygrps-yiv-200112998">My stepmom grew up here in the Willamette Valley and swears that when she<br/>
was little, it snowed every winter and was so cold through winter that<br/>
every year they ice skated on the ponds.  Now it is rare to see much snow<br/>
or extended cold here in the winters.  Just little ol&#39; me with not much<br/>
understanding of science can look and observe the cars with their exhaust<br/>
and the factories with their stinking smoke( I live by Weyerhauser) and<br/>
the skies filled with &quot;stuff&quot; from airplanes.  True, they are making cars<br/>
burn cleaner and filters so the factories don&#39;t stink as often or as bad,<br/>
but surely it affects the air we breathe on which we depend for survival.<br/>
 And I&#39;ve heard some people defend atomic energy saying it doesn&#39;t<br/>
pollute the earth, but you have to put the waste somewhere and it takes<br/>
virtually forever to become harmless.  How can anyone say that makes<br/>
sense?  Why do we all have to live with so much modern conveniences,<br/>
anyway?  It just seems to make the world we live in so much more<br/>
complicated and ugly.  It&#39;s like saying diet doesn&#39;t have any influence<br/>
on our health, which I totally disagree with.  That&#39;s just the opinion of<br/>
little ol&#39; me.  <br/>
