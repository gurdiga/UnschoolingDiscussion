&lt;&lt; All right: The racist and sexist white European male part of the country <br/>
which was expropriated from the natives and built on the backs of slaves was <br/>
already Christian. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How&#39;s that?  : ) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still not true, but you&#39;re getting warmer!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite stupid parts of the current (add your own adjectives here) <br/>
Christian history of the U.S. for their own purposes is that before Europeans <br/>
came to north America the natives all hated each other and warred all the <br/>
time, scalping  and being cannibals and sodomizing buffalos (OR whatever ugly <br/>
picture they can paint as they explain patiently to children that only <br/>
liberal humanists can claim that Indians were anything but ignorant savages). <br/>
 THEN, lucky for them, Christianity came and some of them, the lucky ones, <br/>
accepted Jesus.  And THOSE few and only those few will be in heaven, and the <br/>
rest, well....<br/>

This isn&#39;t history, it is moronic imagination; ideas by people who don&#39;t give <br/>
a damn for truth or Christ. That they proclaim such things in the name of <br/>
Christ is beside the point. Stop hanging out with them if they piss you off <br/>
so much; they piss me off too. I mean, if you go to them to study modern <br/>
methods of sociopathy, go ahead. But don&#39;t go to them for Christianity or <br/>
history.<br/>

<br/>
How can you say those two things in consecutive sentences?<br/>
<br/>
CHRISTIANS are teaching homeschooled Christian children that view of U.S. <br/>
history.  It&#39;s part and parcel of the stuff you&#39;re saying here this week. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Stop hanging out with them if they piss you off <br/>
so much; they piss me off too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HANGING OUT with them?  <br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;hang out&quot; with them, I&#39;m just associated with them by people who <br/>
hear &quot;homeschooling&quot; and think &quot;ignorant, separatist, gun-toting Christian.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA will defend them, but not me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I mean, if you go to them to study modern <br/>
methods of sociopathy, go ahead. But don&#39;t go to them for Christianity or <br/>
history.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where else will their children go for Christianity or history without risking <br/>
eternity in hell?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556924708">Yeah, and I&#39;ve read that when Pocohontas asked the white women about <br/>
how to follow their God, the first thing they told her was that she <br/>
had to stop wearing her heathen clothes and dress like them.  That is <br/>
sick and SO unchristian.  <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Pocohontas found Christ in spite of them. <br/>

Christ so they can know the truth and be armed against the evil humanists<br/>
who would try to fill their heads full of lies.<br/>
<br/>
(Anyone&#39;s kids ever gotten a tract about the evils of Halloween instead of<br/>
candy while out trick or treating?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ideas by people who don&#39;t give<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In your opinion. They love Christ as much as you do. They&#39;ve begun with the<br/>
same book and reached different conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
They do see the pathway that God wants them to walk as very narrow. It&#39;s<br/>
probably an outgrowth of the belief that the Bible is infallible. If the<br/>
Bible is literally true then there can&#39;t be more than one legitimate<br/>
interpretation. And the one who speaks with the most authority is the one<br/>
who obviously has managed to hit the nail on the head. (Just my guess.)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t see their viewpoint as legitimate :::shrug::: It doesn&#39;t change<br/>
the fact that they do see it as legitimate.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would help to read what&#39;s being written about the Christian<br/>
fundamentalist homeschoolers as *not* being presumed to represent any other<br/>
Christians way of viewing Christ or Christianity. It&#39;s just the far end of<br/>
the spectrum and from their viewpoint just as legitimate (or more actually!)<br/>
than any other view.<br/>
