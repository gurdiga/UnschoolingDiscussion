<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648690574">Hi Wendy,<br/>
                We&#39;re actually doing the opposite of you. We&#39;ve been<br/>
unschooling for the past few months and it stresses me out too much not<br/>
having something concrete everyday. We are going to try Oak Meadow this<br/>
fall. I&#39;m glad to hear you like it. I doubt we&#39;ll follow it to a tee, but<br/>
it&#39;s nice to have something to fall back on.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Wendy and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; live in Little Rock, Arkansas. We&#39;re homeschooling leaning toward more of<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; unschooling approach. My son Dylan is six and Tristan is four. The past<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; years, I&#39;ve purchased Oak Meadow which I really like. However, we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; picked it up for a couple months now so I would say we are on our way to<br/>
&gt; unschooling. My son Dylan LOVES numbers and money. He really is doing well<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; math. On the other hand, he hates reading. I totally believe in<br/>
unschooling<br/>
&gt; but honestly, it has been hard for me to not worry. I&#39;m not asking for any<br/>
&gt; advice or anything. It&#39;s just nice to know there are others out there like<br/>
&gt; me.  I guess I&#39;m still dealing with a husband who doesn&#39;t really &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m glad to be here and look forward to participating in this<br/>
group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wendy<br/>
