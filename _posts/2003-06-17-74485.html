  Nancy, if you liked How It Works, I bet you&#39;d like www.howitworks.com  and you can get their daily email in which they link to four how it works explanations.  And if you are in need of finding out how something does work, go the the website and do a search.  They have an incredible amount of information on that site.  It&#39;s great.<br/>

    Last night the kids and I were flipping through the channels, and we ran <br/>
    across a 1/2 hour show called &#39;How it works&quot; (can&#39;t remember what channel).  It <br/>
    takes different &quot;things&quot; and just explains how they work.  Really cool.<br/>
<br/>
    But then we ran across a REALLY good documentary on the Discovery Channel <br/>
    about cavemen, narrated by Alec Baldwin.  It was so cool because he started at <br/>
    the species furthest from us and proceeded up the line, showing each skull, the <br/>
    differences from ours and from the species before it and after it (in the <br/>
    scheme of evolution) then there&#39;d be a reinactment of what scientists believe each <br/>
    group looked like, acted, what they ate, relationships, etc.  Only bad thing <br/>
    about the whole show was the commercials!  LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
    Long story short, it got me to thinking I&#39;d like to know of any favorite, <br/>
    quality, &quot;educational&quot; (or not) channels and especially shows your families enjoy <br/>
    and really get something out of.  I believed for a long time that a TV was <br/>
    almost an enemy of homeschoolers, but for the last year have realized how many <br/>
    possibilities it has!!  <br/>
