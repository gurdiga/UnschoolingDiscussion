<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492897070">Hi folks,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while (and learning so much from you all!), so I<br/>
thought I&#39;d combine a short introduction with a call to any homeschooling or<br/>
unschooling families who would like to join the Menomonie Area Homeschoolers<br/>
in West Central WI.  I&#39;ll be posting this to a few groups, so please forgive<br/>
any crossposts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Sandy Horner, 45 and am fairly new to the homeschool adventure.  My<br/>
daughter, Alexa, 8, would be going to 3rd grade, had I not decided to pull<br/>
her out of school last spring.  I&#39;m currently working part-time as a massage<br/>
therapist (2 days a week in my office), and am going to try to bring my<br/>
business home to our hobby farm in the country (horses, maple syrup<br/>
operation, orchard....we keep pretty busy ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Alexa and I belong to a co-op of homeschoolers that is rather small at the<br/>
moment (5 families with a few more interested), and would like to grow a<br/>
bit.....the more the merrier, so they say! Some of us are unschoolers,<br/>
others more structured, but we welcome all.<br/>
<br/>
About us (from our flyer):  The Menomonie Area Homeschoolers is a group of<br/>
active homeschooling families who cooperate to create an enriching<br/>
environment for homeschooled children ages 4-18 and their families.<br/>
Families with younger siblings can be involved too.<br/>
<br/>
The lively and eclectic group is organized as a cooperative - there is no<br/>
director or teaching staff.  Each family helps develop ideas for classes,<br/>
organize sessions, teaches mini-classes, and maintains the building.  We&#39;d<br/>
love to have you join us.<br/>
<br/>
We meet on Thursdays from 10am to 2 pm at the Family Learning Center, 1703<br/>
Wilson Street in North Menomonie (about 2 minutes from the Menomonie exit<br/>
off I-94).  We welcome new and experienced homeschool families.  Come in and<br/>
observe for a day, or call for more information.<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca Kilde: 715-265-7421 or Luisa Gerasimo: 715-235-5289 (or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bsf2@...">bsf2@...</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Our building is also available for rent, so if you need a spot for your own<br/>
homeschool group that has outgrown its space, or any group that needs a<br/>
kid-friendly space, we&#39;re happy to rent ours!<br/>
<br/>
Smiles,<br/>
Sandy & Alexa</div>
