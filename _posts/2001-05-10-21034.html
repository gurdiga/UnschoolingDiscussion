<div id="ygrps-yiv-198772209">Hi,<br/>
 Welcome to the list. I&#39;ve only been on it a few weeks. I&#39;ve had my 3 boys<br/>
at home now for a year and a half. They are ages 3,7 & 9. We live in Texas<br/>
so we really have no regulation problems. Texas considers home a private<br/>
school. You didn&#39;t say what state you live in. I&#39;m sure some of the other<br/>
list members might be able to offer insight on your state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326113093">Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Whether you will have any problems really depends on the state you reside<br/>
in. But homeschooling is now legal in all states.  So finding a way to meet<br/>
the law shouldn&#39;t be too burdensome, depending on your personal philosophy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi! Sharon<br/>
<br/>
Seems we have a couple of things in common.  I too am an older mum <br/>
50+ and my youngest daughter is an only one, even though she has 3 <br/>
brothers and a sister, they have all flown the coope.<br/>
I removed my dd (almost 13yrs old) from school 12 months ago now.  We <br/>
tried school at home, but that was a disaster - so we turned to <br/>
unschooling.  I was adviced to deschoool first.  So I did, and we <br/>
still are, and life is great!!!<br/>
<br/>
So my advice to you, is the same as what was given to me.  Give your <br/>
child (and you) time to deschool - have fun, there is a whole life <br/>
time for learning..<br/>

First, welcome to our group. What state are you talking about? Have you checked the law to make sure the school district is not requiring more than you legally have to comply with? <br/>

<br/>
Where do you live?  Each state does it a little differently and you almost <br/>
never get the straight info the first time it seems and everyone has their <br/>
own take on things.  There are a lot of good sites around to check info on <br/>
and compare.  One is www.nhen.org.<br/>
<br/>
People here are very friendly, so if you have any questions just holler!  I <br/>
do all the time!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. <br/>

I have a question for you... I also have a 13 yo that we decided not to send <br/>
back to 8th grade last fall and have had home this past year.  We also tried <br/>
homeschooling but it just wasn&#39;t working and sort of fell into the <br/>
unschooling method.  He has two older sibs - girl 21 and boy 18 each <br/>
graduating from their respective schools in June, college and High school.<br/>
<br/>
This is where my question comes in... how do your older kids accept your <br/>
choice to unschool?  Do they make comments about how you&#39;re ruining a future <br/>
or anything like that???  Just curious because I&#39;m having a hard time with <br/>
my kids.  Usually they just grumble between themselves but my dd is <br/>
wondering when I&#39;m sending him back to school or what he&#39;s going to do if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have any &quot;education&quot;.  And if they do comment how do you respond??<br/>
<br/>
Can everyone tell I&#39;m getting a little bit of pressure right now?  Even my <br/>
dh doesn&#39;t seem very supportive at this time... or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m <br/>
just going through a rough time of my own.  I don&#39;t know.  Just asking for <br/>
suggestions here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Thanks.  I just got &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; from the library and was going to start <br/>
on it soon.  I think I&#39;ll just read and recommend that my dd read it.  After <br/>
all, if she&#39;s planning on a field in Psychology she should be open to many <br/>
new ideas, right??  &lt;here&#39;s mom dreaming that she&#39;ll eventually have an open <br/>
mind&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this will help a lot.  I know that she just thinks he&#39;s wasting his <br/>
time.<br/>

<br/>
First my older children are all around 30yrs except my other daughter <br/>
who is 22yrs.  I have no negative comments at all.  They just accept <br/>
it. My second 2 sons hated school, and really didnt learn anything <br/>
anyway. What they both did learn was learned once they left school.<br/>
Now we never pushed any of our kids academically.  Their happiness <br/>
was always more important than grades. So in a sence I suppose I have <br/>
always been an unschooler at heart!!<br/>
If any one ever does question what we are doing I always ask them how <br/>
much of what they learned at school do they remember now - and what, <br/>
if anything, they use in the job they are doing.<br/>

&gt;We also live in an isolated rural area.  Our state<br/>
&gt;requires ongoing testing and monitored documentation.<br/>
&gt;Thus far, I have met no one in our county who is<br/>
&gt;actually going this independent route!  I have heard<br/>
&gt;rumors of such pioneers......but they seem to be as<br/>
&gt;isolated as I am!! Perhaps on purpose! Should I<br/>
&gt;anticipate particular problems related to an of the<br/>
&gt;mentioned issues?  Well, here we are.......it is good<br/>
&gt;to know that you all exist......in all of your diversity!!<br/>
