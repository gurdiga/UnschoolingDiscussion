<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839963466">I heard this the other day on NPR and thought Mr. Freundlich hit the<br/>
nail on the head.  For those of you who might not have heard it, I<br/>
wanted to share.  What follows is the transcript from NPR.  <br/>

Commentary: Illogical reasoning of a war against Iraq <br/>

Article Text: <br/>

MICHELE NORRIS, host: <br/>
<br/>
The deliberations at the UN over possible military action in Iraq have<br/>
featured thousands of pages of documents and hours and hours of debate,<br/>
not to mention all the press conferences, Op-Ed articles and pure<br/>
speculation that have filled the airwaves in the last few months. But<br/>
even after all of that evidence and discussion, commentator Peter<br/>
Freundlich still wants to express the trouble he&#39;s having trying to make<br/>
sense of the argument to go to war. <br/>
<br/>
PETER FREUNDLICH: <br/>
<br/>
All right, let me see if I understand the logic of this correctly. We<br/>
are going to ignore the United Nations in order to make clear to Saddam<br/>
Hussein that the United Nations cannot be ignored. We&#39;re going to wage<br/>
war to preserve the UN&#39;s ability to avert war. The paramount principle<br/>
is that the UN&#39;s word must be taken seriously, and if we have to subvert<br/>
its word to guarantee that it is, then by gum, we will. Peace is too<br/>
important not to take up arms to defend. Am I getting this right? <br/>
<br/>
Further, if the only way to bring democracy to Iraq is to vitiate the<br/>
democracy of the Security Council, then we are honor-bound to do that<br/>
too, because democracy, as we define it, is too important to be stopped<br/>
by a little thing like democracy as they define it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, in dealing with a man who brooks no dissension at home, we cannot<br/>
afford dissension among ourselves. We must speak with one voice against<br/>
Saddam Hussein&#39;s failure to allow opposing voices to be heard. We are<br/>
sending our gathered might to the Persian Gulf to make the point that<br/>
might does not make right, as Saddam Hussein seems to think it does. And<br/>
we are twisting the arms of the opposition until it agrees to let us<br/>
oust a regime that twists the arms of the opposition. We cannot leave in<br/>
power a dictator who ignores his own people. And if our people, and<br/>
people elsewhere in the world, fail to understand that, then we have no<br/>
choice but to ignore them. <br/>
<br/>
Listen. Don&#39;t misunderstand. I think it is a good thing that the members<br/>
of the Bush administration seem to have been reading Lewis Carroll. I<br/>
only wish someone had pointed out that &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; are meditations on paradox and puzzle and<br/>
illogic and on the strangeness of things, not templates for foreign<br/>
policy. It is amusing for the Mad Hatter to say something like, `We must<br/>
make war on him because he is a threat to peace,&#39; but not amusing for<br/>
someone who actually commands an army to say that. <br/>
<br/>
As a collector of laughable arguments, I&#39;d be enjoying all this were it<br/>
not for the fact that I know--we all know--that lives are going to be<br/>
lost in what amounts to a freak, circular reasoning accident. <br/>
