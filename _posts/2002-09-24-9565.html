That&#39;s the one I got for my sons.<br/>
I feel better about it now!  It&#39;s worth banning!<br/>

Why did this make the list??<br/>
<br/>
-=-Summer of My German Soldier by Bette Greene-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is a sweet book.  My sister and I read it aloud to each other when we <br/>
were teens, while driving my dad to west Texas to see his relatives.  He had <br/>
arthritis bad, and was in the back seat mostly sleeping while she and I drove <br/>
his cadillac down THE longest straightest roads, but that story was in the <br/>
air and it made the hours and miles go by.<br/>

it&#39;s fun and does not overtly encourage reading, but might encourage<br/>
socialization and giggling.<br/>

Why do children become such specialists?<br/>
