<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233606739">hi,<br/>
<br/>
here is a web site which has links to other sites.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.momsonline.com/jobwise/directions/article.asp?key=CD990017">http://www.momsonline.com/jobwise/directions/article.asp?key=CD990017</a><br/>
it&#39;s via oprah/oxygen so i would have faith that these are legitimate<br/>
sites and probable well worth checking out.  one link<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.Workaholics4Hire.com/)">http://www.Workaholics4Hire.com/)</a> states that it is a &#39;no-fee&#39; site and<br/>
offers legitimate work-at-home jobs.<br/>
