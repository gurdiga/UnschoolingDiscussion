<div id="ygrps-yiv-335403972">I checked my e-mail at 8 last night and woke up at 4 with 50 new e-mails.  Am I the only one that slept around here??  <br/>
<br/>
Hello to all the new folks on the list.  I&#39;ve been going rather fast through a kabillion (that&#39;s a new number we came up with along with forty hundred thousand) e-mails.  I&#39;ve read every one but they have blurred.  So, hello and welcome aboard...<br/>
<br/>
Valerie - Book cover:  &quot;NOT Another Brick in the Wall&quot;  That was Floyd, wasn&#39;t it?  The picture is a red brick wall with a double photo of a mass of faces, one brick is vertical with a picture of your daughter.  It would appeal to everyone&#39;s desire for individuality.  Something that so many are lacking, especially children in school.<br/>

Alberta, Canada - Hi Dee Ho.<br/>
<br/>
Jeanmarie - We met a phsyc a few weeks ago that said homeschoolers are deprived a wider variety and quantity of life experiences that schooled children have, to help them in real life.  Of course, my husband and I really wanted to ask how &quot;kiddie prison&quot;  can provide &quot;life experiences&quot;  to anyone but the lab rats!!!!!!  We were nice and, like with most, left her to her fenced-in world. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only been here a few weeks and LOVE IT!!  I know unschooling is the way for us but it helps to have others to talk to or just listen to sometimes.  I&#39;ve read a lot of books about home/unschooling and get Growing Without Schooling magazine, but this better than any book (not that I won&#39;t love to read your book Valerie).<br/>

Interesting that you mention this.  When my son was in 6th grade they (the <br/>
teachers and school &quot;counselor&quot;)ambushed us at a parent-teacher meeting and <br/>
after showing us some of Sean&#39;s artwork tried to tell us all these things <br/>
that were wrong with him... and how he was heading for trouble.  He was <br/>
&quot;aggressive&quot; and had poor self-esteem, etc, etc.... well, what they were <br/>
getting at was that he would turn into one of those children we hear about <br/>
that hurts animals/pets or even, heaven forbid, a boy like the boys who did <br/>
the Columbine thing.  No matter how much I told them that I, as his mother <br/>
and one who had done attachement parenting for his first 4 years, knew him a <br/>
whole lot better than that they wouldn&#39;t believe me.  All that Psych stuff <br/>
and they thought they knew my son better.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if they could only see him now... of course, he&#39;s afraid to draw <br/>
anything, or at least show us any of his work for fear of criticism, but <br/>
he&#39;s doing so much better self-esteem wise... and he cries, and always has, <br/>
if he sees an animal in pain or being hurt.  It was the teachers and the <br/>
school that turned him the way they did.  I&#39;m now trying to take all that <br/>
out of him.  It may take us a few years, but I&#39;m willing to give it that <br/>
time... now if only others would stop asking him when he&#39;s going back to <br/>
&quot;school&quot; we might have more success here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about the long post.  Sometimes I just tend to get carried away... <br/>
especially when I start thinking about the way my &quot;baby&quot; was treated.<br/>

Which is one reason why I&#39;ve taken myself off of the ywca program because their goals were clashing with what Naomi and I wanted to do...hence the move.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979462977">Hi!  I am new to unschooling groups.  I can relate to JeanMarie&#39;s story of<br/>
the unnecessary low self-esteem they(public school) place on children.  I<br/>
had a son that we had homeschooled and decided to place him in public school<br/>
for his 2nd grade - BIG MISTAKE!  He was in ps for 6 weeks and the school<br/>
decided he was doing well in all subjects except reading .  They were<br/>
unwilling to provide him with the necessary help and were wanting to place<br/>
him in first grade.  Needless to say- we yanked him.  My now 3rd grader, who<br/>
probably reads at a late3rd, early 4th grade level, feels that he doesn&#39;t do<br/>
well at ps.  <br/>
The reason I joined unschooling was to see if there are some Minnesota<br/>
members that might be able to give me some insight and instruction about<br/>
legalities and records and such.  We are currently residing in Missouri but<br/>
will be moving in approximately 2 months to the Minneapolis area.  If there<br/>
is someone out there with advice - please send it my way.  Thanks.   Kate<br/>
