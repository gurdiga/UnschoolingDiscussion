I  emailed the owner and never heard from her... so I guess I&#39;ll forego  that<br/>
particular discussion board.  :-(&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Hard to unschool when you&#39;re so easily dissuaded. It takes desire and  <br/>
tenacity to unschool.<br/>
 <br/>
All message boards have quirks and glitches. There&#39;s human error as  well.<br/>

I was a  <br/>
member of the Unschooling.com message board for the past two years  <br/>
(what happened there?) and have been missing the disscussion so much,  <br/>
I tracked ya&#39;ll here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===================<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s being revamped, they say.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Pam created another message board here:<br/>
_http://unschooling.info_ (http://unschooling.info) <br/>
and I hope you&#39;ll post there!<br/>
<br/>
Direct link is this, but if you go to  the one above you can see the <br/>
beginnings of the collection of articles and links  too, and it&#39;s easy to remember. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520556621">I haven&#39;t been able to open unschooling.info since last night.<br/>
Could someone who has the keys (as it were) see if there&#39;s a  <br/>
problem?  If it&#39;s open and fully functional, I need to see what&#39;s  <br/>
with my browser or something.  If it&#39;s not open, open it up!! Thanks.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s down (&quot;I repeat, the piper is doon&quot;) but very smart people are<br/>
working on the problem.  <br/>
