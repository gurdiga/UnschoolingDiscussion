uncircumcised penis I saw was at the nude baths/saunas in Weisbaden, Germany.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here, here, Shyrley!  It&#39;s a bummer that there&#39;s so much hype and almost <br/>
hysteria around our bodies.  When I was 13 back in 1971 I went on a camping <br/>
trip with my older sister.  Truth be told, it was a bunch of hippies.  If <br/>
my parents had been wise to what was going on there, I&#39;m sure I would not <br/>
have been permitted to go.  It was a 4-1/2-mile hike straight uphill from <br/>
the road where our dad dropped us off, and we camped there for two <br/>
weeks.  When I was 13, I was fairly innocent; I was not all that aware of <br/>
drugs, I did not smoke cigarettes, I didn&#39;t even know that many curse words.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, there were a lot of people camping at this particular spot <br/>
also.  It wasn&#39;t like the campgrounds you see today.  It was this wonderful <br/>
huge pond along the Appalachian Trail and people would just find a fairly <br/>
level spot, set up their tarps (to protect our guitars from the elements) <br/>
and sleeping bags, and build a fire pit.  Every now and again you&#39;d see a <br/>
tent, but that was really rare.  It was mighty funky.<br/>
<br/>
What was very interesting (understatement) to me was that there was a <br/>
tremendous amount of nudity.  Sometimes, people were just walking around <br/>
naked. Sometimes folks would just get naked to swim.  The first night I was <br/>
there, I was pretty uncomfortable and I didn&#39;t know what to rest my eyes <br/>
on, but it was *the culture* there. You just couldn&#39;t stay uncomfortable <br/>
with it for long.  So...I got comfortable.  I got very comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I never used my bathing suit the whole time I was there.  You were only <br/>
allowed to camp there for three nights, so whenever a park ranger would <br/>
come along, we&#39;d strip and jump into the pond and swim all the way across <br/>
the pond to someone else&#39;s campsite (about a half mile or so) until the <br/>
coast was clear.<br/>
<br/>
But something weird happened.  One day I was out in the pond swimming, and <br/>
a bunch of Boy Scouts were hiking along the trail.  When they saw me out <br/>
there swimming naked, they all started yelling at me and cat-calling and <br/>
all sorts of embarrassing stuff.  I felt that I could not come out of the <br/>
water.  A friend saw what was going on and tossed me out a shirt, and I was <br/>
able to get out.  The whole thing made me sad and it made me think.<br/>
<br/>
We have continued the tradition in our family of being comfortable with our <br/>
bodies.  Liam is naked easily as much as he is dressed and in the <br/>
summertime our house is a clothing-optional house.  When people come over <br/>
to go swimming its okay not to wear bathing suits, and the kids never <br/>
do.  It is weird, though, how people who are uncomfortable with their <br/>
bodies can change the atmosphere for everyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree here.. I think she may be sorely  disappointed LOL.. .. In <br/>
our home we have very little modesty.  We&#39;re practically nudists.  Seeing a <br/>
naked person of the opposite gender has never been a big deal(Im NOT talking <br/>
about pornography)  Its just skin, ya know.  <br/>

<br/>
But the point is here in the United States, we do have taboos about nudity <br/>
and people don&#39;t expect to see naked people on the streets or even for the <br/>
most part at the beaches. We do have designated areas where it is okay, but <br/>
I do believe it needs to be stated so those who will be offended. If one <br/>
wants to walk around naked all day in your own house or back yard and invite <br/>
others, fine. I don&#39;t expect to see it in public though. And I&#39;m far from a <br/>
prude.<br/>
<br/>
When I walk my dogs or take a walk with my kids and the people down the <br/>
street on the corner have their son naked all the time, I have a problem <br/>
with that. He&#39;s maybe 5 and most nights in the summer, totally naked. They <br/>
have no fence and he&#39;s out in the street anyway. It bothers me. I&#39;m sure if <br/>
we all did that, I would be use to it. But we don&#39;t here, and for most of <br/>
the country, we don&#39;t.<br/>

Are you saying you were perfectly comfortable right off the bat, no confusion <br/>
about sex or male parts?<br/>
My kids are going to get &quot;The joy of Sex&quot; or some similar book as a wedding <br/>
gift. And they have anatomy books here, and have seen us running around <br/>
either naked or in undies. Jared saw me in thong underwear the other day and <br/>
went &quot;EEEEeeew&quot; and then &quot;why doesn&#39;t it have a butt on it?&quot; :)<br/>
My mil hadn&#39;t been told anything about sex or male parts and had never seen a <br/>
male body before she got married. I had some conversations with her about how <br/>
very frightening the first night was and how she wished someone would have <br/>
been more open with her.<br/>

together.  I think they would make a great wedding present for your <br/>

were like two little kids who got to explore a new castle. There were <br/>
lots of doors to look behind and lots of unknowns--but that was half <br/>
the fun.  And as long as we were together, we weren&#39;t scared.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t about him having his way with me or me trying to hide fear in <br/>

What a nice way to put it. I&#39;m glad it all worked out for you both! I would <br/>
certainly want my children to have the same feelings and experience. The <br/>
only thing is I wouldn&#39;t expect it to necessarily be in marriage or to last <br/>

child molestors.   Just like a lady wearing a short skirt and low cut blouse <br/>
is NOT asking to be raped. Although , if she were raped, the arguement would <br/>
be made that she &quot;asked for it&quot;     Once, way back when I was a new, young <br/>
mother,  I was probably about 20., a co-worker who had children MY age said <br/>
that her husband would not let them wear backless sundressese or two piece <br/>
bathing suits as babies ( or heck, as children, period)  He  felt it was <br/>
improper, it may serve to &quot;tease&quot; child molestors.  I thought OMG.. HE is the <br/>
one that is perverted.. ANYONE who would look at a baby and say they had the <br/>
potential to &quot;tease&quot; someone has got to be seriously whacked.     I would say <br/>
that if someone feels uncomfortable seeing a child nude, then they are the <br/>
ones viewing the child in a sexual manner.  Like I said before, the bottom <br/>
line is, its just skin. <br/>

I often envied my brothers during hot summers when they could run around in shorts and I had to put on a T-shirt too.<br/>
It didn&#39;t bother me that she got so hot and sweaty (and VA summers are huuuuuuuuumid) that she tok her shirt off.<br/>
