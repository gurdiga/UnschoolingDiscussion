have had incredible conversations in the car about this. (I still remember <br/>
when he announced why kissing always looked so weird in movies. &quot;Mama...they <br/>
use their TONGUES!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The big advantage, of course, is that when the parent is driving, eye contact <br/>
is impossible. You can have all kinds of potentially embarassing <br/>
conversations without having to look at one another. <br/>
