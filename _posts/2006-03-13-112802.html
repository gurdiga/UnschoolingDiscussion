  Hopefully this link will work well. While it looks a little choppy in the editing, not quite clear in a couple areas, I think the reporter did an excellent job in sharing our unschooling with the local community. :-) I was a little nervous about doing this interview, but I think it went well. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ll check out the paper itself tomorrow, and see if I can get it scanned so I can share any pictures. <br/>
   <br/>
  There is one typo in that we are planning a trip to the NC Gourd musuem, not gourt (which we&#39;d seen on Food Network&#39;s &quot;Unwrapped&quot; tv show).  And later on the bit about the worms is chopped up into another paragraph so it doesn&#39;t sound quite right. Oh..and towards the bottom it should be that &quot;It may seem to be chaotic around here&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  She did quote Sarah exactly on the &quot;It&#39;s fun and stretches my brain to new heights&quot; quote about reading. <br/>
   <br/>
  I had alot more to say about unschooling with Megan and how I see it benefitting her as well. <br/>
   <br/>
  Other than that...really, I think it came out pretty well. :-)<br/>
