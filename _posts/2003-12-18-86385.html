<div id="ygrps-yiv-683841425">I am feeling like such a horrible mother right now. Megan was just evaluated this morning by the Early Intervention Team. We were worried about her speech, she had basically no words until the end of August (turned 2 on August 3), but her speech is blossoming since then, but it still isn&#39;t that clear...understandable, but not clear. She has a habit of sticking her tongue out all the time...but it turns out that she is delayed in many other ways that I hadn&#39;t realized...like she still uses her whole hand in order to pick things up rather than a pincer grip (which left her unable to stack the blocks into a tower)...things like that...<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m floored..they said she has delays in every area, not just her speech as we&#39;d expected! My friend called, and she pointed out to me how much we&#39;re on the go going places, or worrying about the housework and things like that and to a degree how very little Megan really PLAYS. <br/>
 <br/>
Then I got a lecture from &quot;friend&quot; as well about homeschooling Sarah, how it&#39;s been weeks since we&#39;ve sat down and done any &quot;school work&quot; and how socially immature Sarah is, how she isn&#39;t really reading well, etc. Then she claimed that Paul also thinks Sarah should be in school, which is not something Paul has said to me. <br/>
 <br/>
From there she went into the kids being social outcasts because they&#39;re different because they&#39;re always at home, and do I want my kids to always be on the outside of life and on and on...basically alot of pressure to put Sarah into school, Logan into Head Start, and Megan into daycare at least a couple days a week. <br/>
 <br/>
Other friend also called, we spoke, she says she has some of the same concerns about Sarah but that Paul has never told her that he thinks Sarah should be back in school or anything, but that we really should consider it or at least going back to more academic work more often with her. <br/>
 <br/>
Someone PLEASE help me to deal with the tremendous guilt and sadness that I&#39;m carrying right now!!! <br/>

I&#39;d say examine where you can do more with them, but keep them home.<br/>

Play more games with physical items, maybe.  One game we used to play was <br/>
with some solid-colored, various-shaped blocks we have.  Kirby and I would get <br/>

it as Kirby was.  So we started going around each of the three of us making <br/>
something and the others copying it.  And Marty was making more creative things, <br/>
too, with blocks leaning, or one just set off from the rest, at an <br/>
interesting angle, or touching a little, but flat on the table.   The whole game was <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528209898">Oh Elizabeth,<br/>
<br/>
Make yourself a warm cup of tea and spend today playing with your wonderful<br/>
children and take note of all the things they CAN do, all the things that<br/>
they know that you didn&#39;t TEACH them.<br/>
<br/>
I used to do developmental testing and one thing I always told parents is to<br/>
remember that even with a diagnosis, your child is still the same child they<br/>
were the day before they came for the evaluation.  Nothing has changed other<br/>
than hopefully, the parents have a little more information.<br/>
<br/>
Now, about those test scores.  For each skill on the test, a bunch of kids<br/>
of various ages were asked to perform the skill.  The age where half of the<br/>
kids could perform the skill gets translated in the testing into the age<br/>
when a child &quot;should&quot; be able to do it.  Remember, for each skill that your<br/>
daughter &quot;should&quot; be doing that she isn&#39;t, half of all American kids her age<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it either.<br/>
<br/>
Back when my daughter was my foster daughter, still an infant, she was<br/>
involved in Early Childhood Intervention.  My daughter&#39;s family background<br/>
and siblings indicated that she would likely have trouble learning, have<br/>
serious mental disorders, etc..  She was 5 months old and not even trying to<br/>
roll over yet.<br/>
<br/>
The therapist gave me some ideas to try to encourage Marsie to try to roll<br/>
over but then she gave me the most wonderful, extraordinary advice.<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;With this one, don&#39;t worry about germs or dirt or clutter or<br/>
whatever.  Just let her explore the world on her terms, as she needs to.&quot;<br/>
In other words, unschool her.<br/>
<br/>
So Marsie spent lots of time in mud puddles, feeling her food with her<br/>
entire body, being allowed to mouth anything that wasn&#39;t poisonous or a<br/>
danger of being swallowed.  We drove most people around us nuts.  No<br/>
pre-school would have allowed what Marsie was into.<br/>
<br/>
Now at 7, she has just been invited to join the competitive gymnastics team<br/>
at her gym.  She is extremely verbal and precocious, well above average in<br/>
intelligence.  Speaking as a mom and as a therapist, as long as your child<br/>
has kids and adults who interact with her in a fun and supportive manner,<br/>
has an environment where she is free to explore different and interesting<br/>
things, being home with family is the best thing going for her.<br/>

You can also blindfold one person. One builds a sculpture, the <br/>
blindfolded one tries to copy it with directions given by the first <br/>
person. Do this with duplos - the big legos. Then try it with legos. <br/>
Develops all kinds of skills - clear speech, clear thinking, focus on <br/>
details of what has to be done/described, listening carefully, <br/>
following oral directions carefully and step-by-step, etc. Really fun <br/>
and beneficial activity. It is also cooperative, rather than <br/>
competitive, which is good for siblings, especially, since both &quot;win&quot; <br/>
when the sculpture is accurately duplicated. Make up variations of <br/>
this. The blindfolded person should have the same pile of blocks or <br/>
legos that the builder used or you can make it more difficult by adding <br/>
a couple of &quot;red herrings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beth -- nobody can do in school for your kids what you can do at home. <br/>
NOT a chance. But you may have to jazz up what you do at home - if you <br/>
are feeling like that is what you need to do, then this is a good place <br/>
to get lots of ideas about how to do that. I&#39;d be cautious about <br/>
falling for the &quot;she&#39;s special and needs school&quot; advice for Megan --- <br/>
that&#39;s just the beginning of well-meaning labeling that will follow her <br/>
forever if you take that route. She might need some professional stuff <br/>
- some speech therapy or physical therapy or whatever -- that is very <br/>
very different than being put into school. I&#39;d be hesitant to even go <br/>
for those things - I&#39;d be more inclined, myself, to educate myself <br/>
about what they&#39;d be doing for her and to do it at home. Pretty much <br/>
anything they can do, you can do better if you make that your priority.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about Megan&#39;s speech.  She&#39;s only 2!  My currently <br/>
11 yr. old ds had no discernable speech until well after his third birthday.  <br/>
I have no doubt that if he had been evaluated he would have been found to have <br/>
a host of other problems as well.  His speech is now normal, and he reads, <br/>
writes, and plays as well as the other kids we know his age.  Back when he was <br/>
3, everyone in my family was so worried about him and thought I should have him <br/>
evaluated and enroll him in preschool.  I&#39;m not really sure why I resisted so <br/>
strongly, but now I&#39;m sure I did the right thing.  He developed in his own <br/>
time and own way.  <br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old dd also had speech/language problems very similar to my son.  <br/>
No language before her 3rd birthday and then lots of articulation trouble.  She <br/>
still has trouble making many sounds and some language difficulties as well.  <br/>
No one is pressuring me to have her evaluated because my son&#39;s speech and <br/>
other areas of development have turned out just fine.  Note that my other 3 <br/>
children&#39;s (15, 9, and 5) speech developed on a typical time schedule.  Just as <br/>
children learn to read at different ages, in different ways, children learn to <br/>
speak at different ages, in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; and do I want my kids to always be on the outside of life &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that school is the &quot;outside&quot; of life.  Home is where life happens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;we really should consider it or at least going back to more academic work <br/>
more often with her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how old Sarah is, but I do know that there is usually plenty of <br/>
time for our children to learn the things they need and want to know.  Are <br/>
there things that Sarah wants to know about or how to do?  If so help her with <br/>
those areas.  Otherwise there&#39;s no need to feel guilt or sadness about her.  <br/>
Think about if she&#39;s happy, and how you feel.  Those are the things that matter.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you are doing a great job.  Be strong in standing up for <br/>
what is best for your children!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942565461">&quot;Do you really like that sigline?&quot; Yes, I do. I thought it was a cute take on the &quot;Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten&quot; essay that was popularly known..let&#39;s see...was it the late 80s or early 90s? ...And I consider it pretty accurate. What I truly needed to know in my life are things I taught myself. I&#39;d rather not debate the semantics behind &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; right now though if you don&#39;t mind..I have other more important things on my mind. <br/>
 <br/>
No, I&#39;m not leaving my children alone all day to learn things on their own. If I was going to do that, then yes, my children would be better off at school. We talk often, I involve them in housework and cooking and I spend time playing with them on their levels. I read to them on a daily basis. My house is always full of children from my neighborhood coming over to play with my children, and one child in particular prefers to be with me and says it&#39;s because I give her attention that she doesn&#39;t get from her mother. <br/>
 <br/>
It is very rare for me to go anywhere without at least one of the children with me. This past summer, I babysat my friend&#39;s four children until the end of July when we were expecting Gracie&#39;s arrival. I spent the month of August in the hospital because I nearly died from complications. <br/>
 <br/>
I can see where, to a degree, Megan&#39;s delays are our fault. In some ways she has not had as much direct attention as I would normally give since about last March until late July, because of various things; and when I came home from the hospital, I made a special effort to be sure to give her more attention from me instead of thinking that she was doing just fine chasing after her siblings and playing with them. That&#39;s when her speech began to improve...I just hadn&#39;t picked up on the other areas. I wasn&#39;t looking for them. There is a speech and hearing problem that runs in our family, so I picked up on that.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not perfect, far from it, but I&#39;m not unwilling to admit when things haven&#39;t been going as they could be. Could I be doing more with them and less other things? Yes, and I will be. Have been in some ways for the past few months but I can see that I haven&#39;t quite &#39;slowed down&#39; as much as we may really need. And that&#39;s probably some of Paul&#39;s pushing lately to return to &quot;school&quot; work with Sarah is that he knows that if I was doing that, I&#39;d have to stay home to do it! <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I do worry about the housework alot. We have a very small house, and with three active children it becomes a safety hazard to have things out of place, and it can be difficult to do much of anything if the house isn&#39;t clean. Personally, I could do with a little less of the constant cleaning, and I tend to let the children&#39;s rooms go..but my husband can&#39;t. <br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate your suggestions of the pages to read. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241032534">&lt;&lt;Then I got a lecture from &quot;friend&quot; as well about homeschooling Sarah, how<br/>
it&#39;s been weeks since we&#39;ve sat down and done any &quot;school work&quot; and how<br/>
socially immature Sarah is, how she isn&#39;t really reading well, etc. Then she<br/>
claimed that Paul also thinks Sarah should be in school, which is not<br/>
something Paul has said to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Betsy&#39;s point about the inappropriateness of expressing that<br/>
idea that your husband is confiding in the friend, but saying something<br/>
different to you. My first thought is that you need a different friend,<br/>
rather than a different educational approach! <br/>
<br/>
I started thinking about what you wrote in a different post about the<br/>
quantity of other kids in your home. Since it seems that Sarah does have<br/>
lots of opportunities to interact with other kids, it seems unlikely that<br/>
she is socially deprived. However, speaking from my own meager experience<br/>
with Jayn (4), I had to limit the time that she was spending with a neighbor<br/>
girl (6) who is schooled and also parented &quot;traditionally&quot; with punishments,<br/>
time-outs, food etc limitations - all the usual stuff. Even a small amount<br/>
of time with this kid seemed to have a bad effect on Jayn&#39;s personality, and<br/>
stress level. I try to find kids for Jayn to play with from our local<br/>
homeschooling support group, with the parents who are gentle, attachment<br/>
oriented etc. <br/>
<br/>
These (mostly) women are also where I find most of my friends now - none of<br/>
whom are going to react to any problem I share, with &quot;send them to school&quot;.<br/>
My group is not particularly unschooling friendly - made up of mostly<br/>
eclectic and unit study oriented families - a few school at homers, but I<br/>
don&#39;t get into those curriculum conversations. But they are universally more<br/>
simpatico in almost every area, than the schooling parents who make up the<br/>
rest of my acquaintance. Jayn mostly wants me to play with her, her daddy to<br/>
play with her, or one other kid to play with her, rather than a group. I<br/>
would say find a local park day with hs&#39;ers, or start one. Your older kids<br/>
may find friends with parents whose style you would trust to be around them,<br/>
for playdates, so you can concentrate some extra time on your 2yo, playing<br/>
some of the fine motor skills support games that others have mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
There was a thread here recently about someone who was feeling sad because<br/>
she was growing apart from some old friends who were not homeschool<br/>
supportive (let alone unschooling supportive). I have had the same feeling<br/>
recently from someone I have known a while - a single mom who has her 2yo in<br/>
full time daycare in order to work. She started going on about the<br/>
homeschooled children she has known who have &quot;social problems&quot; in an &quot;I know<br/>
better than you&quot; tone of voice. The conversation was initiated because she<br/>
was concerned about the policy of her daycare place to initiate/push early<br/>
academics on her son. (He&#39;s 2!!!!) I was responding that she should follow<br/>
her heart and gut about not allowing them to be the &quot;experts&quot; about her<br/>
little boy. I guess I am not really sad about letting this friend fade out<br/>
of my life!<br/>

<br/>
If it wasn&#39;t for the &quot;friend&quot;&#39;s daughter, I probably wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with her...I don&#39;t really know how to end things at this point since we&#39;re neighbors and everything.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084304791">I had a conversation tonight with the mother of a little girl who was on <br/>
Janene&#39;s soccer team.  (soccer is over.)<br/>
<br/>
Mom  I can&#39;t MAKE Brianna learn her letters.  I sit down with her to <br/>
teach them and she gets frustrated and then we both start fighting.<br/>
Me  So why does she need to learn her letters.<br/>
Mom (looking at me with this &quot;have you lost your marbles&quot; look, which <br/>
was actually pretty funny) What do you mean?<br/>
Me  Well, why does she need to know her letters?<br/>
Mom  Cause she needs to learn to read?<br/>
Me  Now?<br/>
Mom  Yes, now.  She&#39;s really behind.<br/>
Me  Behind, how can she be behind, she&#39;s five.<br/>
Mom  Well she is.<br/>
Me  Who says she&#39;s behind?<br/>
Mom  Uh, the school says.<br/>
Me  And they know this how?<br/>
Mom  Cause they&#39;re the school (another great look, I&#39;m so crazy.)<br/>
Me   Doesn&#39;t she have the rest of her life to learn to read, is there a <br/>
reason she must know this information right now when she&#39;s so little?  <br/>
Maybe she&#39;s not ready to learn to read, developmentally.  Maybe she <br/>
doesn&#39;t WANT to learn to read.  Maybe she has other things she&#39;s <br/>
interested in doing now, rather than learn silly ol&#39; letters or learn to <br/>
read. <br/>
<br/>
I think I got mom thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to the mom about how years of being told &quot;you can&#39;t read&quot; by <br/>
teachers and other school folks can make that really happen. <br/>

First of all, don&#39;t invest too much into the opinion of your friends.  Your <br/>
opinion is what counts, especially with regard to your children and how they <br/>
are doing.  It seems to me that the first friend really crossed a line and <br/>
sounded like a busybody to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, children develop at different rates, and what is slow for one <br/>
happens swiftly for another.  Even those who are &quot;delayed&quot; have spurts of rapid <br/>
development and then appear to be learning nothing, changing little, and even <br/>
regressing.  It&#39;s normal and is well documented.  My father told me years ago <br/>
that if Jake (then less than 1) is not learning how to walk, he&#39;s learning <br/>
something else.  So true.  <br/>
<br/>
Look into your baby&#39;s eyes and see her for who she is.  Accept her there, <br/>
right where she is.  No one should try to hurry her to get grown.  Trust her to <br/>
blossom before your eyes, and trust yourself, too.<br/>

Maybe don&#39;t have &quot;professionals&quot; evaluate your kids anymore?  Maybe <br/>
pretend that you never did and forget all the stuff they&#39;re telling <br/>
you?  <br/>
<br/>
If you feel like your 2 year old isn&#39;t getting enough play time, then <br/>
make sure she gets enough playtime.  You don&#39;t need to feel guilty <br/>
because you recognize an area that your kids need something more from <br/>
you. Don&#39;t feel guilty, just start doing it!   I think we should <br/>
constantly re-evaluate ourselves as parents so we can find ways to <br/>
improve.  You said you&#39;ve been doing a lot of running out of the <br/>
house--but what kind of running?  If you&#39;re taking your kids to <br/>
museums and playgrounds and cool places where she can see new, <br/>
interesting things, and if they all seem to be enjoying it, then I <br/>
certainly don&#39;t think you need to worry. <br/>

there seemed to be a lot of questions, concerns and negativity rather than <br/>

places where we can be negative--not about our commitment to unschooling, <br/>
but about anything that may be happening or we may be concerned about how <br/>
to handle. Sometimes people are looking for reassurance when their kids are <br/>
not writing operas or living up to all the fabulous feats of some <br/>
unschoolers.  There are so many times when unschoolers are on the defensive <br/>
and out to show how wonderful it is that we don&#39;t have very many places to <br/>
vent our concerns and questions, know what I mean? Life is not perfect <br/>
whether we unschool or not, and it sure is nice to have people who will <br/>
understand and offer sound advice without the knee-jerk reaction of &quot;send <br/>
them to school&quot; or &quot;do more workbooks.&quot; That&#39;s what makes support groups <br/>

I can&#39;t help wondering how much your husband helps out with any of this. If <br/>
he can&#39;t let the rooms go or has his own set of standards, is he working to <br/>
meet those standards or simply enforcing them through you?<br/>
<br/>
I understand what a difficult situation you are facing, and it sounds to me <br/>
like you and Paul may need to really sit down and do some serious talking. <br/>
You&#39;ve said in the past that he&#39;s not completely on board with the <br/>
unschooling. I think you guys need to be presenting a united front--always <br/>
important but doubly so with dss on your backs! Maybe you guys need to work <br/>
out a little bit more clearly how things are going to get done and to what <br/>
extent--a plan that works to meet the family&#39;s needs not just one person&#39;s <br/>
demands.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m reading something into this situation that&#39;s not there, but it <br/>
sounds like an awful lot is being put on you without much positive input or <br/>
help from dh. Dunno.<br/>

Paul does help, but he can really make it seem more like he&#39;s doing it because he thinks I won&#39;t...or if I&#39;m asking him for help right that minute with something, he&#39;ll say he&#39;ll do it later, and not get around to it. <br/>
 <br/>
Everything lately has pretty seemed to grind our lives to a halt. At times it seems we have so many little fires going there&#39;s no way to put any of them out. <br/>
 <br/>
We decided to see a counselor together for a few sessions, but have been working as well to iron things out so that we&#39;re on the same page again about EVERYTHING. <br/>
Not that it excuses anything, but I&#39;ve been suffering from some serious PPD and only went back on Paxil a couple weeks ago, and I&#39;ve decided to find a counselor again for me for some Adderall because I know it&#39;ll help me to be able to be calm enough to work things out well again...<br/>
 <br/>
SO that should help...geez...I&#39;m sorry to anyone who could care less, but yeah..we&#39;ve had more going on than just &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;academics&quot;...It has been one incredibly long and difficult year for our family...It&#39;s like juggling in a way...we had certain balls (ourselves, marriage, his job) going well...then we added four little clubs in slowly, the last three a little quicker than we liked but that was ok, we kept them going and it wasn&#39;t really any trouble......and then other things started coming at us from nowhere (sticks, and plates, and ribbons) and it has been too much...you lose your focus and things will drop.<br/>
 <br/>
So things dropped a couple weeks ago...we&#39;re still trying to get the balls and the clubs going again and to heck with sticks and plates and ribbons...if that makes any sense! <br/>
 <br/>
Paul and I are talking more than we have in months, and we&#39;ll make it through all of this, I&#39;m sure. <br/>
 <br/>
One thing positive in the last week has been specifcally in regards to the kids being at home. Paul said he&#39;ll back off and watch longer before saying he thinks unschooling is a failure and we need to go back to more traditional academics. He&#39;s just really worried about the kids ending up behind. I said I recognized that concern, and explained that we&#39;re still deschooling right now. I also asked Sarah to read some of her Brownie book that she&#39;s been working on aloud to Daddy so he could hear her, he was surprised because he hadn&#39;t realized how much she&#39;s improved. I asked him to play store with her or something if he was worried about her math skills, and to email with her from work (and home) if he&#39;s worried about her writing. He said he would...<br/>
