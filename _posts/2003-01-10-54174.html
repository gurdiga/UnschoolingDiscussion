<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695608183"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;In the land where a &quot;good wife&quot; gets up and keeps<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hubby&#39;s tea filled and makes his plate, I&#39;m already fighting an uphill<br/>
battle.  I&#39;m not doing it.  For the sakes of my future daughter-in-laws, I&#39;m<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, I have a husband who does housework without a second<br/>
thought.<br/>
(He&#39;s NOT from the South. &lt;g&gt;)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tuck, you could be talking about Japan here! Even when co-workers go out<br/>
after work  for drinks, the women are often expected to pour the beer and<br/>
otherwise serve the men.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s funny is, my Dh &#39;s mother worked outside the home so she needed him<br/>
to help around the house. But now when we go there to visit she waits on us<br/>
hand and foot....and he reverts to age 12! no, actually at age 12 he would<br/>
not have expected to be waited on.<br/>
<br/>
My son wants to help wash the dishes and I try to let him help.....gritting<br/>
my teeth the whole time as water splashes all over the floor......<br/>
