<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We have had some of the same problems even though 
we live in the country.&nbsp; We have one house that is within walking distance 
to ours, and it has been inhabited off and on during the four years we have 
lived here.&nbsp; All three of the families that have lived there have had kids 
and they have not been the types of kids I wanted my kids to be good friends 
with.&nbsp; The worst was the last family, three kids, three different dads, 
boyfriend (dad of #3) living in, mom spent the day watching the worst of the 
talk shows, with no regard to whether or not the kids we watching.&nbsp; It was 
not good!!!&nbsp; The oldest wandered up to our house constantly, probably 
because he was bored out of his skull at home.&nbsp; I tried to be friendly, 
hopefully be a positive influence, but my main focus had to be my own 
kids.&nbsp; There came a time (summer) when I <em>had</em> to put my foot down 
and say &quot;It is time for you to go home now.&quot;&nbsp; No explanations given.&nbsp; 
It didn&#39;t matter if I wasn&#39;t going anywhere, it was just time for the kid to go 
home!&nbsp; The mom never said anything, maybe never even knew, I don&#39;t 
know.</font></div>
