about the Gun issue.  I&#39;m particularly impressed with Lynda and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
writing skills and quite envious they can write in such an eloquent fashion <br/>
for long periods of time.  My only hope is they both write books or maybe <br/>
even one together (LOL) on topics that are heated, from completely different <br/>
perspectives.  I find it fascinating.....  Now that I&#39;ve come up with an idea <br/>
for a book for 2 people to write, maybe I ought to think about becomming an <br/>
agent (LOL)..<br/>

more money than their clients &lt;g&gt;<br/>
