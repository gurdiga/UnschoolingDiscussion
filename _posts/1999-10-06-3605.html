&lt;&lt; A lot of this, if not all, will mean nothing to the non-Christian.  It&#39;s <br/>
based<br/>
 on scripture and God.  To those of you who are going to read this, please<br/>
 don&#39;t take offense and think I am saying you have to follow this.  Erin asked<br/>
 me a question of what I have learned and the reasons to the way I believe.  I<br/>
 am simply answering her question.<br/>
 <br/>
 God intended our priorities to be:<br/>
 1. God<br/>
 2. husband/wife<br/>
 3. children<br/>
 <br/>
 When we get away from that and put children before our husband/wife<br/>
 relationship and sometimes even before God we are getting into child-centered<br/>
 parenting.  Putting the child&#39;s feelings before anything, including their<br/>
 behavior.  Always making the child &#39;feel&#39; happy instead of making him<br/>
 responsible for his actions.  When the child leads what the family does<br/>
 instead of mom and dad.  Basically making the child the center of our<br/>
 existence.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Faith,<br/>
      I have purposely kept out of this conversation until now.  I really <br/>
hate confrontational topics, as in other loops, I have watched things <br/>
escalate until there were hurt feelings, wrong interpretations, and out and <br/>
out war.  However, I really feel as though I must step in on this one.  Also, <br/>
like you have said, I don&#39;t mean this<br/>
as being against you.  I really hope you don&#39;t take offense either.  I just <br/>
feel very strongly, and even led by my faith in God, and the path we have <br/>
taken, to clarify some things.<br/>
     Before I begin, I must tell you that you have the wrong understanding of <br/>
what Attachment Parenting is.  It is &quot;not&quot; the child &quot;leading&quot; the family!  <br/>
It is not soooo<br/>
child-centered that the child is leading the family, controlling the family, <br/>
or even the center of the family.  Quite opposite!!!!!  By allowing the child <br/>
freedom from being &quot;controlled&quot;, the parents are also free!!  The parents (if <br/>
they feel led to) can still put God First, Spouse Second, and Children Last.  <br/>
The difference is that we don&#39;t feel like there is a need to say &quot;Hey kids, <br/>
you must sit over there on the couch while your dad and I have alone time, <br/>
because Dad must come first!&quot;  Instead by loving, respecting, and listening <br/>
to each other (even the kids---especially making the kids a part of <br/>
that--they deserve respect and listening to just as much as an adult), it <br/>
just comes natural.  It is like letting your kids know that there is enough <br/>
love to go around to each of them (whether you have two kids or fifteen).  <br/>
They feel so loved, accepted, and respected that they don&#39;t fear or resent <br/>
that you have love first for God and then your husband.<br/>
We show them by our actions every day, and by the things we talk about, that <br/>
God comes first because he is the Almighty, the Creator, the Savior of the <br/>
World.  Then they know that our spouse comes next because we fell in love and <br/>
married each other before we ever had the kids.  They know that, understand <br/>
that and respect it because they feel confident and secure in the love they <br/>
get from us, and that is because they are being raised by &quot;Attachment <br/>
Parenting&quot; and &quot;Positive Discipline&quot;.<br/>
     First of all, I am a Christian.  I am a very strong, devoted to Jesus <br/>
Christ, even considered Fundamental Christian.  I was born in a Christian <br/>
home, so I have been a Christian all of my life.<br/>
     Second of all, I was raised exactly the way this Ezzo guy is teaching in <br/>
his classes.  My parents are very much into this way of raising children <br/>
(although they have never heard of this guys name).  I was born into that <br/>
time period where parents were told not to hold their children very much (it <br/>
would spoil them), to let them cry it out (it was good for them), to make <br/>
them sleep through the night in their own bedroom (we were fed cereal at 2 <br/>
weeks of age, and then if we woke during the night, they would stick a <br/>
pacifier in our mouths to make us go back to sleep), we were spanked even as <br/>
babies (to stress &quot;no&quot; to us and teach us what not to do), we were fed every <br/>
4 hours (not ever in between to matter how hungry we got--we were to be <br/>
trained to eat at the proper time), we were potty trained early (my mother <br/>
loves to tell the story of starting potty training me at 9 months of age.  If <br/>
I had an &quot;accident&quot;, I was paddled for it), we were never allowed to give our <br/>
opinions about anything (that was &quot;mouthing off&quot; and we were smacked across <br/>
the mouth for that), we spent our days in playpens and bouncers.  Our parents <br/>
both worked and we went to babysitters (they didn&#39;t have all the daycares <br/>
like they do now).  I was lucky, because our babysitters were our <br/>
grandparents or an aunt.<br/>
     Anyway, my parents and me and my brother all had alot of stuggles once <br/>
we became older.  My brother and I resented the fact that we were not allowed <br/>
opinions of our own.  We hated being smacked or spanked for every little <br/>
thing (half of the time we didn&#39;t even know what we had done wrong.  We were <br/>
always &quot;flinching&quot; and afraid of being hit, because we didn&#39;t know what we <br/>
were doing to cause it.  We lived in a type of fear, because we couldn&#39;t ever <br/>
tell for sure if we were doing something right or wrong.  Yet, my parents <br/>
loved us!!  They weren&#39;t doing these things to abuse us or hurt us.  They <br/>
actually thought that this was the way kids should be raised!<br/>
     Now I am 39 years old.  I have four children of my own, and the oldest <br/>
is 17 (almost 18).  My parents have insisted on trying to control my life <br/>
even now.  They still think that &quot;respect&quot; for ones parents (like the bible <br/>
says) means that I should automatically obey and follow their opinions on <br/>
everything.  Instead of spanking me, now they say I am stupid, or I am not <br/>
using my head.  They call me stubborn and say that I have never listened!  <br/>
This all came about because they didn&#39;t like my homeschool methods!  (They <br/>
were both public school teachers).  They also don&#39;t like the way I keep <br/>
house, or the way I raise my kids, or my ideas on what is right or wrong, we <br/>
even disagree about some of the things in the bible.  I tend to take the <br/>
bible very literally (but by literal, it means I study and try to find out <br/>
what the Greek or Hebrew words really meant, because alot of times their <br/>
meaning is very different than ours).  Finally, I had to lovingly (but <br/>
firmly) tell my parents that I am an adult, I am 39 and I have to live my own <br/>
life!!  They were livid!!!  They shouted and screamed at me in front of my <br/>
children and some friends that were over (I had just got out of the hospital <br/>
after having a hysterectomy, so there were people over trying to help me).<br/>
My friends sat me down and finally opened my eyes that my parents were <br/>
actually abusing me---even if they thought they were doing it out of love.  I <br/>
have noticed that alot of parents who raised their kids in the way this Ezzo <br/>
guy teaches, do not want to give up control of their kids when they are <br/>
grown.  And that is what it is all about CONTROL.<br/>
     Now to try to get on to my story.  When my first son was born in 1982, I <br/>
started off raising him in much the way I was raised.  After all, that is the <br/>
way I was raised, my friends were raised, and it was the way our church <br/>
taught.  The difference was that I did try to breastfeed him (I had <br/>
difficulties with him latching on however--he has a tongue thrust problem-and <br/>
I had cracked and bleeding nipples.  Unfortunately the only La Leche League I <br/>
could get hold of was long distance, we had no groups by us at that time, so <br/>
I finally gave up) and I did hold him all the time---against all the advice <br/>
that I was spoiling him.  But I did spank my son for disobeying and I did <br/>
make sure that he always obeyed me.  My mother was always pointing out to me <br/>
that I should always be the one in control (there is that word <br/>
again!!!!---see it is about control!) and not my child.<br/>
     When my 2nd child was born 4 years later, I was still raising them the <br/>
same way.  Since I had trouble nursing the first time, I didn&#39;t even try with <br/>
the 2nd child.<br/>
However, as I watched him become a toddler, I began to be troubled with the <br/>
way I was raising my children.  I was struggling with my parents having so <br/>
much control over us (I was 25 and I had never told my parents to let us make <br/>
our own decisions.  They told us which house we should buy.  They told my <br/>
husband to go back to school---and he did, although he told me that he really <br/>
resented their interference, and he thought I should &quot;cut the apron strings&quot;, <br/>
and they told us how to raise our kids.)  I was very much under the influence <br/>
of my parents, and I was really starting to resent it.  I felt much like a <br/>
puppet on a string!<br/>
     When my 3rd child was born, I had decided to make some changes.  I had <br/>
no support group or even friends that believed in the way I was deciding to <br/>
go.  I had never even read about it, but my new pediatrician was very much <br/>
into breastfeeding and letting your baby sleep with you.  I was excited by <br/>
the concept and I decided to do that with my son.  Well I had alot of <br/>
opposition!!  My parents and everyone else around me pushed me to not nurse <br/>
long, please don&#39;t nurse out in public, please don&#39;t continue to sleep with <br/>
your baby--you will suffocate him!!, please quit nursing on demand--you will <br/>
spoil him and he won&#39;t be trained right.  Well thank goodness, for once I was <br/>
stubborn enough to ignore everyone and follow my own instincts!!!<br/>
I wish that I had even followed them longer than I did, because unfortunately <br/>
I gave in under pressure and quit nursing him at nine months (it looked so <br/>
awful to nurse him when he was so old!!!!---everyone kept telling me!)  <br/>
However, I continued to pray and study my bible and question God about the <br/>
way I was raising my children.  I was still spanking them and &quot;controlling&quot; <br/>
them and things just didn&#39;t feel right!  My children would get angry and <br/>
rebel against the control, and I would get angry and try even harder to <br/>
control them!  I knew that my Christian friends and family all said that that <br/>
was the way Christians should raise their kids, but it sure didn&#39;t feel <br/>
Christian to me.  I could not imagine Jesus Christ ever treating a child this <br/>
way!<br/>
      Anyway, after much praying and thinking, I decided to take this even <br/>
farther with my fourth child.  I nursed her until she was 18 months old (I <br/>
would have gone farther, but I was pregnant again, and the OB told me to quit <br/>
because I was having problems.  I really regret quitting, since it hurt both <br/>
me and my daughter to quit before we were ready, and then I still lost the <br/>
baby anyway a few weeks later), I allowed her to sleep with me all the time, <br/>
I kept her on me buy wearing her in a cloth front baby carrier, and I fed her <br/>
on demand and she never took a pacifier---she used me as one instead, so <br/>
there were times it seemed like she never quit nursing :-).<br/>
It was wonderful and I loved it!<br/>
     Anyway, my parents hated it!  Especially when we began to quit spanking <br/>
our kids and allowing them more decision making.  My mother said that we <br/>
would lose control!!  You know what though?  We haven&#39;t lost any &quot;control&quot;.  <br/>
We are still the parents, so when it comes to big monumental decisions, we <br/>
still make them.  Our kids can&#39;t go out and get drunk, or have sex, or walk <br/>
out in front of a car--just because we dont try to &quot;control&quot; their lives and <br/>
make them obey.  They know that there are some things that we know would hurt <br/>
them and they take our word for it,<br/>
However, I have noticed that the younger two children are much more at peace <br/>
with themselves, they are happier and closer knit to me, they care alot about <br/>
the feelings of the people around them, and they have been TONS more <br/>
healthier than the older two.  I really feel like this was because of <br/>
Attachment parenting.  (Unfortunately, even though we had began to practice <br/>
this, I wasn&#39;t aware there was a term for it until a year ago.  By then my <br/>
youngest was 7 years old!!  A little late for a support group during the <br/>
fact!).  As a matter of fact, when we started this, my older two were too old <br/>
to really benefit.  Besides our infant daughter, we had a 3 yr. old, a 6 yr <br/>
old and a 10 yr. old.  Now I have really regretted not starting with the <br/>
Attachment parenting when our first child was born.  It was too late to have <br/>
the 6yr old and the 10 yr old come back to bed with us.  They were happy <br/>
sharing a bunk bed with each other.  However, we did start the &quot;positive <br/>
discipline&quot; and more listening and allowing them to tell us how they felt.  <br/>
There has been such a change in my kids!!!  There is not so much tension and <br/>
rebelling at authority.  They don&#39;t have to worry about being hit or spanked <br/>
when they do something we don&#39;t like.  However, I am constantly being told by <br/>
my parents (although they wouldn&#39;t admit that they were being raised right), <br/>
by my friends, and by strangers and people at church that my kids are so well <br/>
behaved!!!  They are also amazed at how well they treat each other!!<br/>
     I really wish that I could have had more children!  Unfortunately, I had <br/>
two miscarriages after our 4th child was born.  I also had alot of &quot;problems&quot; <br/>
until finally I had a hysterectomy.  Now that is another big regret!!!!!  I <br/>
wish that I had looked into alternative treatments and medicine and maybe now <br/>
I would have more kids!!  If I could have had more (even by adoption), I <br/>
would practice attachment parenting.  I am a very firm believer in it, as I <br/>
have seen the consequences from both sides!  I would constantly recommend <br/>
Attachment Parenting, breastfeeding, and no hysterectomies (unless absolutely <br/>
necessary-like cancer) to everyone.Believe me, the children raised with <br/>
Attachment Parenting are much better behaved than those raised in such a <br/>
strict manner.  And kids raised by Attachment Parenting are NOT controlling <br/>
their parents!  Believe me, I know!  God still comes first in our lives, and <br/>
I teach that to my kids by my actions not just words!!!  Then my husband <br/>
still comes 2nd.  This my kids also see by actions.  They see us walk off <br/>
onto our acreage and take walks into our woods holding hands, or having our <br/>
arms wrapped around each other, while we have our heads close together <br/>
talking.  They see us smiling, laughing, teasing, and kissing each other.  <br/>
They see us go out on a &quot;date&quot; every once in awhile--just because we want to <br/>
be together.  My kids have no reason to resent this, because we don&#39;t make <br/>
them sit down and let mom and dad have their time together!!--instead we <br/>
spend so much time laughing and loving as a &quot;family&quot; that it is natural that <br/>
their parents would love each other and spend time alone.  After all, their <br/>
parents were together before the children were ever in the picture!!  Last <br/>
comes the children.  But we include them in almost everything we do <br/>
(homeschooling, church, going out to eat, going on trips, etc) because we <br/>
ENJOY spending time with our children.  We enjoy playing with them, learning <br/>
with them, talking with them and listening to them.  It is wonderful not to <br/>
feel like I have to &quot;control&quot; them.  Now that I am away from that, and I have <br/>
seen the wonderful consequences of this new way of life, I realize how <br/>
&quot;silly&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; it is to feel like we have to control our kids!  <br/>
Where in the bible does it say to &quot;control&quot; anybody?  The only time I <br/>
remember reading about &quot;control&quot; it dealt with ourselves. LIke controlling <br/>
our tongue or our actions!<br/>
     As far as finding in the bible about Attachment Parenting, I am sure <br/>
that there are some references to it if someone looks for them.  Off hand, I <br/>
can&#39;t come up with Chapter and Verse.  I do know that there were instances <br/>
were things are suggested, like Solomon (I believe it was) whose mother <br/>
weaned him before giving him to Gods work.  If you study Greek and Hebrew <br/>
translations, you will learn that it was &quot;typical&quot; to wean children from the <br/>
breast quite late (like age 4-6 yrs old).  You will also learn that children <br/>
went every where with their parents and worked along side of them.  They were <br/>
not shipped off to school.  As a matter of fact, only boys were sent to <br/>
school, and usually they were about 12 or 13 yrs old by then.<br/>
      Because of my interest in historic facts about families, I have read <br/>
about families back then.  It seems as though, by the things I have read, the <br/>
poor families of those times lived in one or two rooms.  Alot of the time, <br/>
the whole family shared one bed, even the teenagers!!   (Voila, the family <br/>
bed was born 1,000&#39;s of years ago!).  Women alot of times wore their children <br/>
on makeshift slings worn on their hip or back while they worked.  Children <br/>
were very involved in family life.  As a matter of fact, it seems like it was <br/>
the last couple of centuries that have become so &quot;anti-family&quot;.  So it seems <br/>
to me that &quot;attachment parenting&quot; is natural, Christian, and a custom from <br/>
way back--even from the time of Christ!<br/>
    Well, as you can tell from the long, long post that this topic is very <br/>
near and dear to my heart.  Honey, I have been where you are.  I know the <br/>
pressures from some of the Christians about the &quot;correct Christian way&quot; of <br/>
child rearing.  Unfortunately, I have also walked down both paths, and I know <br/>
which path is working the right way and feels right.  I feel so much that <br/>
this is the Christian way of raising kids.  I go to a very Fundamentalist, <br/>
Bible preaching church.  My church is very large (over 600 people), but I now <br/>
know many, many Christians who also believe this way.  Before you jump into <br/>
this, please, please pray alot more about it.  Check it out more fully.<br/>
I have heard from my Christian circles about how awful this new teaching from <br/>
this Ezzo guy really is.  Most Christians I know now, would never take that <br/>
path.  But most of all, I know first hand how damaging that can be to raise <br/>
your children like that.  First of all, I know how much it has hurt me.  <br/>
Second, and worse of all to me, I know how much it hurt my own children to be <br/>
raised like that.  It is a regret that will always bother me and I am so <br/>
sorry for it.  I really would hate for you to also look back and regret what <br/>
you have done to your kids.  All of us are only telling you these things <br/>
because we care!!!  It is not to hurt you or offend you.  We really are <br/>
afraid that you may make a mistake that you will regret for the rest of your <br/>
life!!!  Please, check into this further!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228739825">Tami,<br/>
Thank you for your concern and sharing with me how you feel.  I would like to say<br/>
that I agree with you wholeheartedly about breastfeeding.  I only breastfed my son<br/>
for 2 months, and I wish I had done it longer but I was only 19 and didn&#39;t want to<br/>
be &quot;tied down&quot;(I really didn&#39;t know what I was doing).  My 5 yr old is my<br/>
step-daughter, and my 2 yr old daughter I nursed for a year and I plan to do the<br/>
same with my 2month old.  I feel that breastfeeding is essential and the way God<br/>
created infants to be fed.  I have friends of mine from church that nursed their<br/>
kids for 2+ yrs.  I don&#39;t argue, at all, that it is the best thing for children to<br/>
be nursed.  I personally wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with nursing for more than 2<br/>
yrs.  But that doesn&#39;t make it wrong to go longer!  Also, I have been known to<br/>
take my kids to bed with me.  I do not do it on a regular basis, but sometimes I<br/>
am just too tired to sit up a breastfeed so I do it in bed and fall asleep with my<br/>
daughter attached.  I have no problem with it and neither does my husband.  Like I<br/>
said I do not make a practice of it though.  I prefer to have my half of a bed to<br/>
myself. :-)<br/>
My 2 year old has been known to climb into bed with us if she continues to be<br/>
fussy and not want to sleep, which is rare, but when she was young I would nurse<br/>
her in bed and fall asleep with her, too.<br/>
<br/>
I also would like to say that I&#39;m sorry for the way your parents act with you.<br/>
They were wrong and I wish things could be different for you.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a very hard time with the fact that so many people are judging the<br/>
Ezzo&#39;s on what they have heard other people say, instead of reading the material<br/>
and then judging for themselves.  All of the posts I have read about what people<br/>
think of the Ezzo&#39;s methods have been based on what they have heard.  The way you<br/>
described your parents is NOT what the Ezzo&#39;s teach.  I have gone over my book<br/>
again since this whole thing started and I don&#39;t find anything in it that is even<br/>
remotely along the same lines as people have said.  They DO NOT teach<br/>
authoritarian parenting at all.  They DO NOT teach parents to totally control<br/>
their children and not let them think for themselves.  Quite the opposite.  All<br/>
the Ezzo&#39;s teach is how to train your children to think for themselves and make<br/>
correct moral decisions.  I don&#39;t find that bad at all.  I want to have children<br/>
who, when I am not there, know the difference between right and wrong and make a<br/>
decision accordingly.  Morality is what they teach.  Not brainwashing.<br/>
<br/>
About the baby thing and the Ezzo&#39;s.  I wrote to Erin on another post about what<br/>
they teach.  Parent-Controlled Feeding is so different than what everyone thinks<br/>
and has made it out to be.  Please find and read that post and it will explain how<br/>
they are not teaching what your parents did.<br/>
<br/>
I myself give my daughter a pacifier in the middle of the night if she wakes up.<br/>
If she goes back to sleep, YEAH.  If she won&#39;t, then she&#39;s really hungry and I<br/>
feed her.  I need my sleep to be able to make it through the day but I do not<br/>
neglect my child.  If she really does need to be fed, I don&#39;t care what time it<br/>
is, I will do it.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to correct something that you misunderstood.  When the parents have<br/>
&quot;couch time&quot; they do not make their children sit down to watch.  The children are<br/>
free to do as they please but just not interrupt mommy and daddy while they talk<br/>
for 10-15 min..  That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for your thoughts and God bless!<br/>
Living for Him, also :-)<br/>

 I am having a very hard time with the fact that so many people are judging <br/>

 and then judging for themselves.  All of the posts I have read about what <br/>
people<br/>
 think of the Ezzo&#39;s methods have been based on what they have heard &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of us HAVE read the materials and taken the classes.  We STILL disagree. <br/>
 I personally have several problems with their methods.  First, since when is <br/>
ONE method right for every child?  Second, How can individual children and <br/>
families possibly have only ONE right way to raise a child?  (The implication <br/>
of the title of the classes is that if you don&#39;t do it THIS way it isn&#39;t <br/>
God&#39;s Way).<br/>
<br/>
Have you been to their web-site? Checked out their discussion boards?  It is <br/>
full of mothers who are in turmoil asking questions about how to raise their <br/>
kids.  They no longer rely on their instinct, they stuff that - because GARY <br/>
says do it this way....  I have sat many hours in tears reading how mother&#39;s <br/>
were worried that the child seemed listless, never smiled, was fussy a lot, <br/>
and they were tempted to give up nursing all together because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
enjoyable - the baby needed to eat to early.  There is NO education in these <br/>
books about breast milk.  (at least the version I have - they have come under <br/>
such fire, that they have SEVERAL revisions because of inaccurate medical <br/>
info) - A child who is exclusively nursed generally CAN&#39;T go 3 to 4 hours <br/>
without eating again.  Often, the baby needs to nurse every hour and a half.  <br/>
Ezzos have not (in the past) made provision for this.  Even my sister&#39;s book, <br/>
which is the latest revision, discourages nursing past 6 months.  How awful!  <br/>
Especially since the medical community has come out and said 1 year is the <br/>
MINIMUM they reccomend.  As far as the GKGW for older kids, it really is a <br/>
&quot;formula&quot;.  I don&#39;t believe God intended us to use a &quot;formula&quot; in raising our <br/>
kids when he said &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is <br/>
old he will not depart from it.&quot;  My studying on this verse leads me to <br/>
believe that we should train our children according to their personalities, <br/>
their own natural &quot;bent&quot;.  Teach them according to their interests, develop <br/>
their God given talents and educate them toward those talents, as God created <br/>
this person and HE knows the path he is to take.<br/>

     On this topic, we both agree!  I do understand what you are saying, <br/>
although I do not agree with you.  However, throughout your other posts, <br/>
there seemed to be a strong vocal point coming from you that Christians would <br/>
not use Attachment Parenting.  You seemed to feel as if a Christian truly <br/>
believed in what the Bible says about raising Godly children, that we could <br/>
not in good faith use another type of discipline except spanking our <br/>
children.  I just felt the need to let you know that there are many very <br/>
devoted Christians out there who do not spank their children.  We all believe <br/>
very strongly in the bible and study it diligently, but I do not think it <br/>
ever tells us that we must spank our children,  As a matter of fact, after <br/>
studying the life of Christ, I feel led to do just the opposite!!  <br/>
     I believe you have the right to make your own decision on the matter.  I <br/>
also feel very deeply that you really love and have concern for your children <br/>
and want only the best.  I am sure that you are truly trying to follow Gods <br/>
leading in this matter, and I will not presume to tell you what God is saying <br/>
to you.  We each have our own personal walk with Jesus Christ.<br/>
      What I am saying is that there are Christians who believe in spanking, <br/>
and there are Christians who believe in Attachment Parenting.  Both groups <br/>
are equally Christians in their faith and we should never presume that if <br/>
someone is raising their children in a different way, then that makes them <br/>
weaker Christians than we are.<br/>
As Christians that practice Attachment Parenting, we still strongly believe <br/>
in teaching our children right from wrong and morality.  We are also teaching <br/>
our children to be able to think for themselves during our absence and choose <br/>
right over wrong.  So it sounds to me like our goals are very similar, it is <br/>
just our methods that are different!   :-)<br/>

I did not mean to sound like all Christians do not chose attachment parenting.<br/>
In fact in the majority, if not all, of my posts I have been very quick to say<br/>
that this is how I do things and that I know that everyone (Christians and<br/>
non-Christianss alike) have their own way of doing things.  Please understand<br/>
that I do not think of myself as the authority to Christian living.  I certainly<br/>
am not nor do I expect every Christian to live like I do!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Faith<br/>
