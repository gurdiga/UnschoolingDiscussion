<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One thing that has stood out to me since I began reading here is<br/>
&gt; the way other people talk about their kids! I was watching<br/>
&gt; Antwone Fisher today (at the theater) and found myself aghast at<br/>
&gt; how often adults are telling kids what they can and can&#39;t do,<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s good for them, what they ought to be thankful for and so<br/>
&gt; on. Even in some of the other homeschool places I post and<br/>
&gt; read, there is such a huge emphasis on how to push, contain,<br/>
&gt; influence, shape, cajole and ultimately control our kids--not just<br/>
&gt; behaviors, but also their thoughts and values too!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This point, Julie, was when it all really hit me.  This is where I suddenly<br/>
started feeling completely out of step with the entire world.  As a society,<br/>
we&#39;re so used to hearing kids demeaned.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m amazed I hadn&#39;t noticed it quite so much before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once you get used to thinking differently, it jumps out at you like a<br/>
scream.    <br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling.  I love my life, and all the things I&#39;ve changed in the<br/>
last year have done fabulous things for my relationship with my son.  But<br/>
sometimes I think it would be nice to fit in.  I can&#39;t do it.  But it would<br/>
be nice.<br/>
