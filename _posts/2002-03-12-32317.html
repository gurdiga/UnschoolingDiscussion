&gt;I don&#39;t agree with this statement. An original definition does not always<br/>
&gt;apply as time goes on.  I believe that an unschooler DOES NOT, require<br/>
&gt;school work, use a math curriculum in order to learn what is &quot;needed&quot;, have<br/>
&gt;an idea of grade x means one learns about turtles in science, breaks down<br/>
&gt;life into subject matter when not required to for reporting purposes, or<br/>
&gt;believes that all children should learn how to read by x age. I believe that<br/>
&gt;those examples are clear cut. I think it is possible to define it to an<br/>
&gt;extent, and beyond that, debate is healthy and productive to learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Elissa, Nobody wrote that unschooling requires any of what you mention <br/>
above. The website I quoted from said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Over time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the <br/>
approach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling <br/>
without following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows the <br/>
child&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life activities <br/>
rather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t make rigid <br/>
distinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And since these are your beliefs, and the term is loosely defined, why <br/>
would you jump on someone by saying this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Elissa wrote:<br/>
&gt;&gt;If you are requiring them to write in their journals and have quiet time<br/>
&gt;&gt;then you are not unschooling. That&#39;s okay to do, it&#39;s just not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are putting your term of unschooling and judging it against others&#39; <br/>
interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
This list has been going through this cycle of someone opening their <br/>
mouth, pouring a piece of themselves out, and then getting told they <br/>
aren&#39;t following a certain guideline that doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I should stop questioning? I should stop learning?<br/>
&gt;I should stop stating my beliefs? I can&#39;t stop picking on others becasue I<br/>
&gt;am not picking on them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nobody told you to stop learning and questioning.. or even clarifying by <br/>
saying.. my idea of unschooling is *more narrowly defined terms stated <br/>
here*<br/>
<br/>
But you have flat out told this woman that she isn&#39;t an unschooler by <br/>
your defintion. Not by asking her to clarify... by no other terms but <br/>
your own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Life is learning and it does cross the parenting line many times. Its not <br/>
up to any of us to decide who is unschooling and who is not by our own <br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A new term. Hmmm.There are many terms that are used for this. Child led<br/>
&gt;learning, Natural learning, Interest led, Delight driven etc. etc.etc.<br/>
&gt;Unschooling seems to be the word in common usage so that is what I use.<br/>
&gt;After all, I can&#39;t just decide to call a banana a gliglybop and have people<br/>
&gt;get an idea of what I&#39;m referring to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you take the DNA of a banana and alter it radically and then go and <br/>
sell the little red spherelike things as *this is a banana and everything <br/>
else is not*, then people are going to question you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, then why are we here? Aren&#39;t we here to talk about what unschooling<br/>
&gt;means to us? What we do all day, what our children do? Because my perception<br/>
&gt;of unschooling is narrower than another&#39;s idea of unschooling, I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;discuss or point out a way that is different because I may hurt someones<br/>
&gt;feelings? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You flat out told that woman she is not an unschooler. That is a far cry <br/>
from talking about... from saying what it means to us.. from pointing out <br/>
our perceptions.<br/>
<br/>
Has nothing to do with hurting feelings. You stated something as fact, <br/>
that is an opinion YOU hold.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t believe everyone should think like I do, that would be a<br/>
&gt;very boring world with no differing opinions. Just consider what I have to<br/>
&gt;say, and treat me as if maybe, just maybe I could be talking with my heart<br/>
&gt;and offering a different viewpoint. Like I said before, give others the<br/>
&gt;benefit of the doubt.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You most certainly did not give that woman the benefit of the doubt by <br/>
telling her right off the bat that she isn&#39;t an &#39;unschooler&#39;. And <br/>
proceeded to give her advice that she apparently didn&#39;t ask for, nor <br/>
apparently need.<br/>
<br/>
A clarification on what you read would of been much more helpful than a <br/>
soapbox on a certain defintion of unschooling.<br/>

more narrowly.  I hate to see unschooling watered down to the point where <br/>
people see nothing wrong with saying that they unschool this or that <br/>
subject but not this and this.  It&#39;s great that they are giving their kids <br/>
choices in at least some subjects.  But if we&#39;re talking about unschooling, <br/>
I also like to see the basic concept of trust in there somewhere, trusting <br/>
kids to learn what *they* need to know rather than what someone else <br/>
(parent, teacher, etc) decides is important.  Trusting them to balance <br/>
their life in the way they need to in order to be whole.  We may know our <br/>
kids better than anyone else, but we don&#39;t know them as well as they know <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I also like to see something about knowledge not being divided up into the <br/>
little pieces you see in the school curriculum.  A person&#39;s knowledge is a <br/>
whole *thing*, always unfinished, and never exactly the same as anyone <br/>
else&#39;s.  Subjects are something imposed from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m undecided yet whether I include unparenting as part of my definition of <br/>
unschooling, but I&#39;m sure finding that my family life gets better as I let <br/>
go more and more of the reins (sp?)  And I never held them that tightly to <br/>
begin with.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would help this list a lot if nobody ever said that someone else <br/>
wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  If we say what we do differently and why, we&#39;ll <br/>
probably convince more people to examine what they&#39;re doing than if we tell <br/>
them they are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
So how *do* the rest of you define unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like all of this, Tia. I&#39;ve been thinking about why we need the <br/>
Definitions. For me, it&#39;s about communication. When another parent at <br/>
a homeschool gathering says, &quot;We unschool&quot;, their use of the word <br/>
implies (to me) certain things we might have in common. As the <br/>
conversation continues, and my new friend begins to talk about rules <br/>
and structure and subjects, my enthusiastic smile slips, and I see <br/>
that her definition of unschooling means something different than my <br/>
definition means. So we lose that &quot;short cut&quot; in communication that <br/>
The (Unschooling)Word gives us. But we don&#39;t have to stop <br/>
communicating. We may have to take our conversation *back* a few <br/>
steps, clear up some confusion that arose from my assumptions and <br/>
hers/his, but the doors are still open, neh? :) <br/>
<br/>
In my life, in this kind of situation, it would be convenient if the <br/>
term were more black and white for this reason. If there were some <br/>
kind of Secret Unschoolers Handshake. (&quot;No, you &#39;do math&#39;. I can&#39;t <br/>
teach you The Handshake.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
My own unschooling ship is guided by that definition that <br/>
says, &quot;Trust children&quot;, and, for me, that includes much more in our <br/>
lives than traditional &quot;schooling&quot;. (This, for our family, includes <br/>
unregulated TV, Nintendo, computer, no &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;requirements&quot; <br/>
imposed from the Parental Authority on High, respect for and trust in <br/>
others, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah.:) I find it helpful, <br/>
exhilarating, to talk with others who see unschooling as I see it. <br/>
But I am really &quot;learning to learn&quot; from those who define *their* <br/>
unschooling differently, to ask *why* they do things a different way. <br/>
To listen to their answers. Sometimes this leads to new and <br/>
stimulating ways to think about things we do in our family. Sometimes <br/>
it reaffirms my own beliefs in what we&#39;re doing, sometimes it gets me <br/>
to think about a &quot;better way&quot; ... or a &quot;different&quot; way ... to run it <br/>
past the ol&#39; internal compass ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919069702">I really like the, unschooling or not, discussion.  Especially how it <br/>
spills into all aspects of life.<br/>
While I agree that it&#39;s ideal that children should be trusted and <br/>
life should be loving and harmonious.  It&#39;s not always an easy thing <br/>
to achieve.  I trust my children in their intelligence.  I trust in <br/>
the fact that they learn what they need to know in life and they <br/>
don&#39;t need coersion to learn things and my ideas of what are good to <br/>
know are not necessarily going to be theirs(and visa versa).  I&#39;m <br/>
fine with all of that.  I don&#39;t limit tv, because it is not a problem <br/>
for us, and we have a lot of fun with it, and learn quite a bit.  I <br/>
played a game called Geography Quest that I got at a thrift store, <br/>
with my dd the other day and all of the stuff she knew in the trivia <br/>
part mostly came from, Animal Planet, Hey Arnold, History <br/>
Channel....I was pretty impressed with her knowledge.<br/>
I don&#39;t however trust that my children will pick up all the bits of <br/>
paper they leave after creating some paper project, or  throw the <br/>
rest of the banana they don&#39;t want into the trash can, instead of <br/>
tossing it onto the floor and having it get ground in(2 yo), or <br/>
flushing the toilet every time, or wiping up the crumbs from the <br/>
sandwich they just made, or shutting the van door when they get out, <br/>
or putting away their toys when done and not completely trashing <br/>
their room before the end of the day, or getting frustrated with a <br/>
younger sibling and pushing or saying mean things, or brushing their <br/>
teeth without being asked and reminded and few times, or not getting <br/>
too rough when playing the &quot;karate game&quot;, or not dumping water out of <br/>
the bath tub, or tracking mud into the house,.......<br/>
They&#39;re kids!  They&#39;re lively and full of ideas with little regard <br/>
for what it all entails.  My two boys(8 and 5) thought it was a good <br/>
idea to have a sword fight with scissors the other day.  I noticed <br/>
this when they came running out of their room, one being chased by <br/>
the other who was yelling in that &#39;going into battle&#39; sort of yell.  <br/>
They are learning, but I can&#39;t keep up with 4 of them and not require <br/>
help.  Require responsibility.<br/>
I have little doubt that if I gave up chores and expectations, that <br/>
they would pitch in here and there.  I&#39;m sure they would.  They&#39;re <br/>
nice kids.  But it wouldn&#39;t be daily, and with the way we live, I <br/>
need daily help.<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m not a neat freak.  There is a pleasant layer of dust and <br/>
grime here. (you know...to build up a good resistance to germs! ;-)  )<br/>

&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since MY idea of unschooling spills over into something like unparenting, <br/>
our household is run with the idea of respect at the core. And coupled <br/>
with respect, is trust.<br/>
<br/>
I trust that the kid will know if he&#39;s cold or hungry. I respect his <br/>
choice to cut his own hair and not want it &#39;fixed&#39; from the barber.<br/>
<br/>
He is allowed to learn what he wants and knows that I will be there to <br/>
help him research more information or to purchase what he needs to pursue <br/>
that interest.<br/>
<br/>
We only require that health and safety issues are followed. Health falls <br/>
under the category of whatever our homotoxicologist defines for any given <br/>
week, organic foods, and eating some greens and some protein each day <br/>
(outside of that eat what you want).<br/>
<br/>
Safety falls into the scope age appropriateness. At the age of 6, he <br/>
isn&#39;t allowed to stay home by himself while I tend to errands that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do. He is allowed to play however he feels he can handle <br/>
it. I trust his judgement on how high he can jump off of things, how deep <br/>
of water he can into, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have defined our paradigms early in life.. and as life goes <br/>
on, it just gets expounded upon. With unschooling being as natural as it <br/>
always was. Never needing to &#39;learn&#39; it, or &#39;accept&#39; it, or let go of <br/>
anything else to achieve it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people come upon it in other ways.. through experience.. through <br/>
awakenings.. through hitting rock bottom and having to rebuild into <br/>
something else, and our definitions might vary.<br/>

You&#39;re not alone. My older sons (15) have decided that they wanted to use<br/>
some textbooks, especially for math and science. I didn&#39;t controlled that<br/>
decision. But I did help them find the textbook they were comfortable with.<br/>
Yet textbooks is a tool, a fragmented tool, like a book of short stories. So<br/>
they constantly go outside the textbook to explore what interest them. And<br/>
there is no question of grading (degrading) or testing. I don&#39;t train them,<br/>
school them...so Perhaps We unschooled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981828168">I understand the feeling.  When I began unschooling<br/>
last year I felt very alone and sort of outcast from<br/>
other homeschoolers.  I was lucky to meet a friend (<br/>
who is like a sister now) to feel alone and outcast<br/>
with.  We have decided to print a flyer one day for<br/>
unschoolers play group.  Believe it or not there were<br/>
a few homeschoolers out there.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.<br/>
 We are not as big as the other homeschooling group,<br/>
but it is a start.  We hope grow.  I know your by<br/>
yourself and it is intimidating to start a group, but<br/>
you have think of it a new friend coming over.  If you<br/>
get one call thats a start too!  Maybe you&#39;ll find a<br/>
fabulous friend like I did. <br/>

Isn&#39;t ashame what society has driven us too.  I<br/>
understand why, which is the sad part.  Sometimes we<br/>
have to refuse other people to push there critisim on<br/>
our way of homeschooling. John holt made that clear in<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480806175">This part of a message I sent last night didn&#39;t come through (my fault). <br/>
Posting it again ...<br/>
<br/>
   Alaura said: I am one of those homeschoolers that unschools with lots of <br/>
books.  <br/>
   Even if you won&#39;t teach me the secret handshake LOL, I am glad when <br/>
   you talk to me, because I am looking for a place to belong.  I am <br/>
   also hoping to learn from you.  We would love to become more active <br/>
   and less bookish.  We love to hear what you do, because it inspires <br/>
   and encourages us.<br/>
<br/>
***A place to belong sounds nice. Our local groups do have a few unschoolers, <br/>
but (there being no identifying mark or secret handshake) I spend just as <br/>
much time conversing with the more structured homeschoolers. And they&#39;re <br/>
really nice people. We see things differently, but I&#39;ve gotten more secure <br/>
about our family&#39;s choices, and don&#39;t feel that I have to counter everything <br/>
these structured homeschoolers do with how WE do it in OUR family. I mean, <br/>
for a while I was insecure, doubting our unschooling path, and needed to let <br/>
everyone know how much better my choices were than theirs. (I was obnoxious <br/>
*cringe*.) I hope I&#39;ve gotten better at letting my life speak for itself.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that 12 step program bit about membership growing by &quot;attraction not <br/>
promotion&quot;?  <br/>
 <br/>
       Alaura : My children and I do not fit in with the local homeschoolers <br/>
becasue <br/>
       we are not as tied to curriculum as they are.  I think they see our <br/>
       wider thinking and tolerance as a threat to their way of life.  I <br/>
       think that their children give them a hard time when they find out <br/>
       how my children make their own plans.  I lean heavily towards <br/>
       unschooling, but we really don&#39;t fit your definition either. <br/>
<br/>
*** Alaura, where are you (location, I mean)? You&#39;re on my VaEclectic list, <br/>
too, I see. Maybe we know each other! (Only at group meetings, you think that <br/>
I&#39;m a structured school-at-homer, and I think you&#39;re a long-time homeschool <br/>
group member who has better things to do than talk to new unschooling people <br/>
... We really do need that handshake!) No, seriously, we&#39;re probably in <br/>
different parts of the state. I&#39;m in Richmond -- or close to it.<br/>
 <br/>
   Alaura: I totally agree with your attitude of respecting children and <br/>
giving <br/>
   them choices.  My children choose to do some textbooks.  We don&#39;t <br/>
   know any unschoolers in real life so that probably has something to <br/>
   do with my children&#39;s choice, but maybe not.  They are both very <br/>
   independent thinkers and they have definite plans for their future.  <br/>
   If they choose to use textbooks to prepare themselves then I feel <br/>
   that I should respect and honor those choices. <br/>
<br/>
*** Well, sure!! I mean wouldn&#39;t ANY definition of &quot;unschooler&quot; include those <br/>
whose kids choose to use textbooks? REQUIRING kids to use textbooks (or <br/>
bookbooks) would be something not included in my personal definition of <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
      Alaura: Is there really any other place for us?<br/>
 <br/>
    <br/>
***There are lots of places to find eclectic homeschoolers, unschoolers, <br/>
self-directed learners. Finding a place you feel comfortable is the trick, in <br/>
my experience. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311161763">Yes,  Lilly,  I&#39;ve been pondering on this.  Most of these HSers I&#39;ve met<br/>
want to have academic groups.  And the moms often fret about a)how great<br/>
they are doing because their children are in x-y-z activities,  or how<br/>
anxious they are tyhat the kidlets aren&#39;t cooperating or accomplishing<br/>
enough,  or what amazing curriculum materials they have.  (&quot;It tells you<br/>
exactly what to say to your child,  so you don&#39;t have to figure anything<br/>
out&quot;  {how sad!})<br/>
When we move,  I want to invite HSers over to play - nothing structured.<br/>
And yes,  I hope to find a fabulous friend or two who has similar thoughts<br/>
on how amazing children are and how much they learn by living life in a<br/>
loving environment.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I understand the feeling.  When I began unschooling<br/>
&gt; last year I felt very alone and sort of outcast from<br/>
&gt; other homeschoolers.  I was lucky to meet a friend (<br/>
&gt; who is like a sister now) to feel alone and outcast<br/>
&gt; with.  We have decided to print a flyer one day for<br/>
&gt; unschoolers play group.  Believe it or not there were<br/>
&gt; a few homeschoolers out there.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.<br/>
&gt;  We are not as big as the other homeschooling group,<br/>
&gt; but it is a start.  We hope grow.  I know your by<br/>
&gt; yourself and it is intimidating to start a group, but<br/>
&gt; you have think of it a new friend coming over.  If you<br/>
&gt; get one call thats a start too!  Maybe you&#39;ll find a<br/>
&gt; fabulous friend like I did.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My children and I do not fit in with the local<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschoolers becasue<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we are not as tied to curriculum as they are.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they see our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wider thinking and tolerance as a threat to their<br/>
&gt; &gt; way of life<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I decide to take my older girls to a weekly &quot;gym<br/>
&gt; &gt; class&quot; - though I hate that<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s called that,  but it was a way for them to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; some activity with<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups of other youngsters during the hours the<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighor kids are in school.<br/>
&gt; &gt; the moms and 5 and under ones hang out during this<br/>
&gt; &gt; time.   I hoped my<br/>
&gt; &gt; children could make friends of some other children<br/>
&gt; &gt; eductated form home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; (We&#39;ll see if that happens.....)  At first,  for me<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was such a relief and<br/>
&gt; &gt; affirmation to just be around ither &quot;homeschooling&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; moms....I expected none<br/>
&gt; &gt; of them unschooled.  I&#39;m sure about all but one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyhow,  I think you are right about it being<br/>
&gt; &gt; threatening to them.  I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; they have a belief that children are empty-headed<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the parent&#39;s job is to<br/>
&gt; &gt; fill up that head with information and (usually)  a<br/>
&gt; &gt; right way of<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking/acting.  I guess this stems from the idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; (empty<br/>
&gt; &gt; slate),  though I&#39;m trying to remember/figure out<br/>
&gt; &gt; the origin of this idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As these weekly meetings go on....I get more<br/>
&gt; &gt; irritated by this schoolish<br/>
&gt; &gt; approach.  I keep pretty quiet on it,  but decide to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be forthcoming and<br/>
&gt; &gt; honest when asked questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     I&#39;m tired and rambling....sorry everyone.....but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just feeling like I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t fit in around here (geographically).   I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; grateful for e-mail......I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have found some people who challenge me to grow and<br/>
&gt; &gt; with whom I seem to &#39;fit<br/>
&gt; &gt; in&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Susan....wishing I knew more unschoolers &quot;with<br/>
&gt; &gt; skin on&quot; the ones in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; area....if there are any...seem to be &#39;in the<br/>

&gt;You&#39;re not alone. My older sons (15) have decided that they wanted to use<br/>
&gt;some textbooks, especially for math and science. I didn&#39;t controlled that<br/>
&gt;decision. But I did help them find the textbook they were comfortable with.<br/>
&gt;Yet textbooks is a tool, a fragmented tool, like a book of short stories. So<br/>
&gt;they constantly go outside the textbook to explore what interest them. And<br/>
&gt;there is no question of grading (degrading) or testing. I don&#39;t train them,<br/>
&gt;school them...so Perhaps We unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  Fits my definition.  Textbooks (and schedules and any other <br/>
kinds of structure) are a tool, like many other tools.  The problem with <br/>
textbooks is in requiring them, or using them to the exclusion of any other <br/>
resources.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely that makes sense, but it still suggests that helping a child who <br/>
feels better with a predictible routine and ritual precludes unschooling. <br/>
Unschooling does NOT necessarily mean &quot;living for the moment&quot; for everybody. <br/>
It means learning (and maybe doing, in most cases) what one wishes for one&#39;s <br/>
own reasons.  <br/>
