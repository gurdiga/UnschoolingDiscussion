<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936554110">Hi! I have been reading thru Sandra Dodd&#39;s website for the last<br/>
couple <br/>
of days and her words have really struck a chord with me.  I feel<br/>
like <br/>
unschooling is right for my family but I have a few questions.  How<br/>
do <br/>
you get over your own feelings and insecurites about unschooling?  I <br/>
am afraid that I will get caught up in the fact that my son isn&#39;t <br/>
reading or doing math yet.  If I can&#39;t &quot;measure&quot; his learning with <br/>
grades will my head explode:)?  How do you let go of that kind of <br/>
mindset?  How do unschooling parents explain to well-meaning friends <br/>
or relatives why their kids aren&#39;t in school (or learning a specific <br/>
curriculum at home)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me ask all these questions!<br/>

It might explode, but it&#39;ll be really educational for the kids to put it  <br/>
back together.<br/>
 <br/>
One of the best parts of having a partner on board with you on unschooling  <br/>
is you can make an agreement that only one person gets to be crazy at a time.  <br/>
Then when one panics, the other can calmly point out all the learning the kids <br/>
 are doing. It&#39;s nice.<br/>
 <br/>
My biggest piece of advice is to get out of the mindset that you are  <br/>
&quot;unschooling the children.&quot; Instead, become a lifelong learning, unschooling  family. <br/>
Is there something you always wanted to do or learn? Do you wish you&#39;d  <br/>
learned to play piano or scuba dive? Do you wish you could make jewelry or write  a <br/>
novel? Do it!  Learning and exploring is compelling, and if the kids see  you <br/>
do it, they&#39;ll do it too.<br/>
 <br/>
It might not look the same, and they may need time to get into it. And the  <br/>
things they do might be different from the things you do. But if the whole  <br/>
family is doing really cool exciting things and talking about the amazing world  <br/>
they live in, family members will get into it too. When you or your child <br/>
talks  about the love of butterflies or playing violin, they might say &quot;I wish I <br/>
could  do that!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s when you say, &quot;Do it! I&#39;ll help!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This is how we change the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you measure and grade during summer vacation, winter vacation, <br/>
assorted holidays? Yet learning is happening there too (maybe even <br/>
especially there). Do you measure how quickly and well your <br/>
spouse/SO/best friend pick up knitting or cooking souffles or <br/>
gardening or whatever? Does your head explode from not measuring them? <br/>
Not likely - mostly you encourage them, maybe notice when the local <br/>
garden club/knitting circle/cooking school is having a special event <br/>
and mention it to them (supporting their interest); you buy them <br/>
materials and books and videos and whatever for gift occasions <br/>
and &#39;just because&#39;. Treat your child(ren) like that.<br/>
<br/>
As was mentioned, what do *you* want to do and be and explore? What <br/>
does he want to do and be and explore? If you are active and <br/>
interested and exploring, you won&#39;t have time for the worries about <br/>
what someone else is NOT doing - you&#39;ll be having too much fun doing <br/>
what you all are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is not willing to do their own considering and truly think <br/>
about things, doesn&#39;t need a big explanation - this is what we&#39;re <br/>
doing,it works for us, end of discussion. Answer questions politely <br/>
but firmly - it is not open to debate (you and your partner might have <br/>
long discussions - and probably should - over this *out of earshot* of <br/>
the kids but anyone outside your immediate household can accept it or <br/>
shut up). We didn&#39;t even use the word &#39;unschooling&#39; for several years -<br/>
 we just answered all questions on our &#39;homeschooling&#39; from that <br/>
perspective. Once they saw that it was a thought out decision, not <br/>
gonna change, we got fewer and fewer questions of that sort and more <br/>
real discussion of the subject. Then we started using unschooling in <br/>
reference to what we do as differentiated from the generic <br/>
term &#39;homeschooling&#39;. But by then the proof of the pudding was our <br/>
loving, happy, curious, growing, interested, interesting, exploring, <br/>
discovering boy. Terminology was immaterial at that point as far as <br/>
extended family was concerned.<br/>
