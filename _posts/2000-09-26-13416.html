<div id="ygrps-yiv-14616845">Thanks to everyone for the great advice and support. I think keeping a <br/>
journal daily to help me realize how much learning is really going on is a <br/>
great idea. I am really looking forward to being part of this wonderful <br/>
communication web. Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I began questioning vaccinations when they began giving newborn babies <br/>
the Hepatitis B vaccine. When I questioned the nurse on this her reply was, <br/>
&quot;We need to start protecting our children now so that when they become <br/>
teenagers and begin to act irresponsibly they will be protected.&quot; I found <br/>
this insane since it is only transferred by blood or sexual contact. <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it seem to make more sense to have faith in our children and our <br/>
guidance as parents to teach them about risks and moral responsibility? <br/>
There is also no long term safety tests on this vaccine. I felt it made no <br/>
sense to put this into my beautiful newborn babies body whose only defense <br/>
was the antibodies from my milk. None of my children are vaccinated.<br/>
<br/>
      Check out this sit if you get a chance: <br/>
www.nextcity.com/contents/summer99/16shots.html It is a great article on the <br/>
history of vaccinations.<br/>

          If anyone has a son or daughter looking for a penpal, my sons <br/>
would greatly appreciate it. My 10 year old can be reached at <br/>
