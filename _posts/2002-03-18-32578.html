<div id="ygrps-yiv-916747470">I grew up Baptist.  As an adult I&#39;ve spent many years<br/>
studying religions, philosophies, and natural<br/>
healing/health-maintenance practices from all over the<br/>
world.  At this time I&#39;m half-way through the journals<br/>
of Thomas Merton.  I&#39;ve enjoyed his books.  His<br/>
journals, for me, are like sitting with an old friend<br/>
and talking about the day&#39;s events.  He was a Catholic<br/>
monk and a mystic who wrote prolifically about his<br/>
spiritual visions and his passion for improving<br/>
himself and the world.  The Catholic church has<br/>
traditions such as saints and exorcism, which implies<br/>
acceptance of psychic phenomena.  I think that&#39;s<br/>
interesting to know about an organization so<br/>
widespread in today&#39;s world. <br/>
