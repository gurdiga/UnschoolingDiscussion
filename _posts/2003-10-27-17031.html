<div id="ygrps-yiv-536244727">still...they need self-defense. I don&#39;t know that the vast majority will be by family members that live in the home. That may have something to do w/ location. In South Eastern NE - it was the parish priest.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying. Is your point that self defense is unrealistic because if it&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s going to happen and the kid is too small, or too young or living w/ the molester?<br/>
<br/>
I see it this way - if self defense, which also teaches logical thinking, self discipline, self awareness and so much more - well, if that self defense saves Brianna in one situation - then it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that when kids are molested in the home....nothing is done?  Are you assuming that everyone in the home is complicit?<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t even understand what the discussion is about. You feel I&#39;m over protective. Okay. I&#39;m over protective.<br/>
Brianna is very confident, self-assured, intelligent....heck, she can (and does) run a business (Mudpuppies Pet Products) she works with me...and does better than many adults. She&#39;s a very good writer. a very good dancer; she&#39;s adventures, curious, thoughtful...and she can defend herself.<br/>
Last winter, a large, hulking bully was teasing her. She handled it great. She went about her business. He teased her every time he saw her. Finally - he shoved her. She laid him out. and left the area. She came home very upset.<br/>
There was the time 93 years ago) she was hit in the face - by a neighborhood kid and her adult tooth was/is very badly chipped. If she had been able to defend herself - she wouldn&#39;t have gotten whacked. Now, if someone is trying to hit her - she knows the moves to avoid injury.<br/>
Is that over-protective? I call that smart. <br/>
If you&#39;re comfortable w/ your 8-10 y.o daughter being alone in a mid-sized city - good for you. I&#39;m not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027691165">Agreed!!<br/>
As I said, my stats could be old - obviously, they are.<br/>
There are some people that we know that scream &quot;victim&quot;. There&#39;s an air about them. It says &quot;helpless&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night, Brianna & I were talking of this - one of the things she brought up was that she & I talk over so many things. She pointed out kids she knows that simply tell their folks little - if anything at all.<br/>
We talk to our kids.<br/>
We believe our kids.<br/>
We know our kids - we pay attention to them.<br/>
That&#39;s missing in so many of the homes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats a very broad definition. There can&#39;t be a female alive you wasn&#39;t <br/>
groped by a teenage boy when in school. I&#39;ve extracted a few hands from <br/>
places where they weren&#39;t invited. One guy when I was 15 needed a sharp <br/>
knee to the groin to get the message. I&#39;ve not thought of this as being <br/>
&#39;molested as a child&#39; however. I&#39;ve always thought of molestation as <br/>
when someonemuch older and more powerful than you takes advantage and <br/>
you can&#39;t do anything to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
Now I would agree that most children have been physically abused if you <br/>
define that abuse as spanking, grabbing, making a child do something etc <br/>
etc. And certainly emotionally abused by adults.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in seeing your figures however. The current BBC report <br/>
says 1 child in7 will be sexually abused. That is a UK figure but <br/>
America has never struck me as a hotbed of paedophiles.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely not.  I was responding to the original poster who posted about<br/>
not allowing her 7yo child play in the front yard without her being present.<br/>
Another poster claimed that the world is simply too dangerous to allow kids<br/>
to play outside without a parent right there.<br/>
<br/>
I am  posting that the vast majority of danger to children is in their own<br/>
home and with people who are supposed to care for them.  &quot;Stranger danger&quot;<br/>
while real is a very small proportion.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe in self-defense, being a 2nd dan, and having studying the<br/>
martial arts for 12 years.<br/>
