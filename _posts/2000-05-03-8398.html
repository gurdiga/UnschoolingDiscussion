<div id="ygrps-yiv-399652456">Thanks Tanya,<br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like your having fun. Thats great. Have you been unschooling since <br/>
last Feb. or this  Feb.? I have been all over the message boards and  I know <br/>
everyone says just be patient and I think for the most part I am, but I feel <br/>
like she should be doing something other than t.v. the only thing is I feel <br/>
bad because she only watches the &quot; GOOD&quot; stations.  Like  the Kratt brother, <br/>
Animal Planet, National G. ,  or she watches videos , dont get me wrong she <br/>
watches other stuff besides animals but its mostly Disney or Nickalodean. <br/>
Every once in a while she will surprise me and do something else. And I <br/>
always encourage this.  She always seem to Know when to turn herself off. <br/>
(when mom is being to enthusiastic, she automatically think its schooly and <br/>
wont even give it a chance.) I try to be mildly interested but she sees right <br/>
through that. I dont think Im coming off as  pushy , the most I say is &quot;That <br/>
looks like fun, or that&#39;s interesting.&quot; These are activities that she picks <br/>
on her own. One word from me and she immediately loses interest. So I try not <br/>
to say anything , then she feels like I&#39;m ignoring her? Kids....who gets <br/>
them? I thought I did but , well I guess not. I&#39;m sorry to rant but at this <br/>
point I think I just need to blow off the steam. She has done a little <br/>
cooking, today we are going to the back yard to try our hand at gardening. <br/>
This ought to be fun, I hope. She hasnt quite caught the idea that flowers <br/>
take a while to grow......hope she dosnt turn it off.<br/>

Thanks for listening<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002244350">Hi Tamie,<br/>
we have been unschooling since last Feb and we love it, there are some days<br/>
I wonder mostly because my children  like to take 4 hours or more to<br/>
complete simple chores they have for the day thus wasting the entire day!!!<br/>
this gets on my nerves allot! I have cut out the t.v almost all together,<br/>
and this helps with the attitude allot, it seems whenever they watch allot<br/>
of t.v. they become lethargic and cranky! I do not require them to do any<br/>
work, but I do phrase it like this, you need to be doing something to<br/>
enhance your brain, educational videos and t.v. fit into that along with<br/>
reading writing , legos, crafts,<br/>
computer programs, cooking stuff like that, rather than video games and t.v.<br/>
they seem to like this well.   I  sit and listen to what they say, look at<br/>
books they have chosen, and try to answer questions  they have, and it seems<br/>
they have lots of interests,  my youngest builds all the time, the middle<br/>
one  is interested in  Shakespeare, and the oldest just spends all of her<br/>
free time reading!!!!!<br/>
hang in there and listen to her you will find she is learning more than you<br/>
think!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I havent been around much lately. Things are just soooo busy. Anyhow,<br/>
&gt;I have been homeschooling since Dec. and only unschooling since Feb.<br/>
&gt;I was just wondering how long do I just sit back and let her<br/>
&gt;(Kearstin-81/2Yog) &quot;Deschool&quot;? She just wants to watch T.V., shes up<br/>
&gt;till all hours of the night. And I noticed a great increase in<br/>
&gt;appetite and gaining weight!! (getting nervous) We go to the library<br/>
&gt;once a week and she gets alot of videos on animals and stuff like that<br/>
&gt;mostly national geographic. And I thought she wasnt learning anything<br/>
&gt;but Im getting nervous about all the hanging around so I started a<br/>
&gt;game of 20 questions in the car and she picked animals as her cat.<br/>
&gt;she did really good on exotic animals but couldnt figure out what cat<br/>
&gt;was? (maybe too obvious?) We have not covered any other subjects and<br/>
&gt;when I bring anything up she gets aggravated with me. We havent even<br/>
&gt;thought about testing yet, and even though my state (NH) is pretty<br/>
&gt;easy to please, it is getting late in the season and now Im afraid to<br/>
&gt;test her. Has anyone heard of the PASS Test and do you know anything<br/>
&gt;about it? I have noticed a big difference in her attitude which to me<br/>
&gt;aught to be good enough I thought that was a great feat. She lapses<br/>
&gt;into that &quot;Cocky&quot; attitude every once in a while but just a look gets<br/>
&gt;rid of it. and we are a little more like partners now , I think we<br/>
&gt;need a little more practice but were getting there. Well Id like to<br/>
&gt;hear from anyone one who has a hard time to be patient. And the<br/>
&gt;waiting game is giving me a.....(I dont know, something though)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Everyone<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Regarding recent postings about the early &quot;panic 
stage&quot; of unschooling, I thought it might be helpful if I shared an excerpt from 
an article I wrote more than a year ago.&nbsp; It is about my own experience 
with free schooling, rather than unschooling, but the principle involved in this 
particle excerpt is exactly the same.</font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>&quot;&nbsp;. . . every person <i>already</i> has an extremely 
effective natural ability to learn and gain skills, which should be encouraged 
and fostered rather than controlled and interfered with. </p>
<p>&quot;The person who understood this best in this century was an 
educational genius from Scotland, A.S. Neill, who founded a famous school called 
<i>Summerhill</i> in England in the 1920s. (It is still going today.) When I was 
fourteen years old, I was lucky enough to go to Barker Free School, a boarding 
school in Canada, which was run just like Summerhill.</p>
<p>&quot;Neill was adamant that you must never force a child to learn. 
Which meant I didn&#8217;t have to attend any classes if I didn&#8217;t want to. So I 
didn&#8217;t. Occasionally I would rouse myself to play soccer if I felt like it. And 
when the school bought an old Plymouth and stuck it in a field where we couldn&#8217;t 
do too much harm with it, every once in a while I&#8217;d have a bash at learning how 
to drive. But most of the time all I did was lie around.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first six months I never even opened a textbook, but I 
did get through more than two hundred Marvel comics. <i>&#8216;The Mighty Thor&#8217;</i> 
was my favourite. I tell you, for a 14-year-old boy that place was paradise.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds like not much was happening, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, in 
fact, a great deal of untangling was going on in my head, out of sight to 
everyone including myself. My natural ability and desire to learn had been so 
bruised and battered from ten years of force-fed schooling, that it was taking 
it a while to wake up to the fact that it could do whatever it wanted to 
now.</p>
<p>&quot;After two years of &quot;free schooling&quot;, I went back into the 
normal school system. I passed exams for all of Year 10 and half of Year 11. In 
other words, I was about four months behind where I would have been if I had 
stayed in high school. But I knew catching up would be no problem, because I 
hardly touched a textbook before sitting those exams. In fact<i>, only on five 
separate days had I done any formal textbook study in the whole two years.</i> 
So my <i>knowledge</i> hadn&#8217;t really changed at all.</p>
<p>&quot;What <i>had</i> changed is that my natural ability to learn 
had been wonderfully rehabilitated, just by everybody leaving it alone. So it 
was much easier for me to <i>use</i> the knowledge I had already learned, and to 
gain more whenever I felt like it. Which has helped me enormously throughout the 
rest of my life.</p>
<p>&quot;This experience also gave me a special awareness of this instinctive 
learning faculty we all possess, which I&#8217;ve been fascinated with, and tinkering 
with, for over thirty years now. Thanks to A.S. Neill, and the wise teachers who 
applied his principles to that &quot;lazy&quot; 14-year-old . . . &quot;</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748658780">Last Feb for the oldest  who is ADD and 13 now she was in the sixth grade<br/>
she would pick  what she wanted to do Mostly late at night , in the<br/>
beginning, I panicked and decided I should lay out a little bit of work from<br/>
several subjects (nothing to difficult  just stuff to work on)  as soon as I<br/>
did that, she completely shut down and did nothing!  she didn&#39;t verbalize<br/>
that she wasn&#39;t going to do it she just plain used every avoidance technique<br/>
known to children and didn&#39;t do it! so I went back to leaving her alone,<br/>
infact, I put all school books up (still accessible)  and got rid of her<br/>
desk  , at the point of pulling her out of school, she was  in the sixth<br/>
grade and reading comprehension was at less than 3rd grade I told her to<br/>
drop down to whatever level she enjoyed,<br/>
she dropped herself down to the 1st grade level and read there for a very<br/>
long time, now one year later she is   reading everything she can get her<br/>
hands on adult books, harry potter books ect.  (this is a child who could<br/>
not comprehend little house in the sixth grade!) she is doing wonderful now<br/>
and averages at least one book a night !!!!!<br/>
the youngest has no interest in reading anything but his lego mag and one<br/>
book he has been reading for most of the year!  the middle child likes<br/>
Shakespeare , and things to do  with acting, she also reads a variety of<br/>
books but not as feverishly  as the first child! those two have only been<br/>
home since Sept.<br/>
well, megga long run on sentence, but I hope it helped you relax a bit!<br/>

I have one of these kids too.  When he&#39;s in &quot;that&quot; mood, showing any sort of <br/>
positive attention is seen as just toooooo much Mom attention.  So he turns <br/>
off.  Luckily, this comes in spurts.  So there are some (really many) times <br/>
when I am happy because he is being &quot;productive.&quot;  One of these days I&#39;ll <br/>
grow up!<br/>
<br/>
How old is your daughter anyway?  I missed that part of the post.  <br/>
<br/>
Gardening project we are doing:  it satisfies the Mom requirement of being <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; and is fun so the kids like it.  We got the free seed packets <br/>
from NASA -- they have tomato seeds that have been up on the Space Shuttle <br/>
and ones that haven&#39;t and you are supposed to grow them and compare.  Mostly, <br/>
we have just been &quot;observing&quot; these plants get way to big for the plot we put <br/>
them in!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  It sounds like it will all work out with time.  And gardening may <br/>
be just the soothing activity needed -- for you!!  :):)<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Karen,</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The term &quot;unschooling&quot; is fairly new to me.&nbsp; 
Apparently it was coined by John Holt, an acclaimed American education 
reformer.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; Free-schooling was founded by AS 
Neill, a British educator, back in 1921 when he set up the Summerhill 
school.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Being new to unschooling, I&#39;m not really qualified 
to make a comparison between the two.&nbsp; But as far as I can tell they both 
advocate giving the child enough space to come to learning on their own 
terms.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The term free-schooling refers to a special type of 
school that kids go to or board at, not home study.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps 
unschooling is simply the home-schooling version of free-schooling.&nbsp; I&#39;m 
not sure if this is correct or not.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as the rest of your questions about your boy 
is concerned, I&#39;d better let more experienced &quot;unschoolers&quot; respond to 
that.&nbsp; The free-schooling situation is different inasmuch as there are more 
other children around for a child to model off than there is in your boy&#39;s 
situation.&nbsp; So the dynamics of the situation would be somewhat 
different.</font></div>

He sounds very 5 yr old boyish : )  I have one who has certainly been a <br/>
challenge to me in the past (and present!).  I looked at the behaviors that <br/>
drove me crazy and realised that they were the very behaviors  I would<br/>
admire or appreciate in a grown man (or not as the case may be LOL).  I<br/>
also noticed that these same behaviors, strong willed, stubborn, determined,<br/>

his father is, things I admire.  Its just difficult when your the mother, and<br/>
that little man is still a young person and your trying to live together <br/>

of outdoor time.  Its what they seem to need : )<br/>

&lt;&lt; He sounds very 5 yr old boyish : )  I have one who has certainly been a <br/>
 challenge to me in the past (and present!).  I looked at the behaviors that <br/>
 drove me crazy and realised that they were the very behaviors  I would<br/>
 admire or appreciate in a grown man (or not as the case may be LOL).  I<br/>
 also noticed that these same behaviors, strong willed, stubborn, determined,<br/>
 single minded, goes to the beat of a different drummer were all the things<br/>
 his father is, things I admire.  Its just difficult when your the mother, and<br/>

            Thanks, Kathy,  it&#39;s always reassuring to hear from someone else <br/>
who has &quot;walked in these shoes&quot; !!                                              <br/>

That is a good idea. She can be so inpatient. That might hold her over. We <br/>
went out there yes. and dug a 5x5 hole to start , guess who got to dig? We <br/>
were eaten by may flies and I got a sunburn on my neck! She had fun though <br/>
lots of &quot;Bugs&quot; to look at, she wants to go to the library today to get a book <br/>
that we checked out last week but we never got a chance to read it. It tells <br/>
about everything for kids to garden and what kinds of soil and what kinds of <br/>
bugs are good for the garden and such, I read through it and it seemed like a <br/>
really good book. So far so good.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Hope dh will do it before I have too LOL.  We are planting some veggies<br/>
in pots, tomatoe, cucumber and in the ground squash and chili&#39;s.  These<br/>
are for my dd &quot;business&quot;.  Then today I couldn&#39;t pass up this beautiful <br/>
