    I&#39;ve had that same call about the magazines and it made me mad because I <br/>
could see how someone could fall for it.  I&#39;ve also had the one where they <br/>
tell you the magazines are free and try to get you to say yes, then say <br/>
something about just a shipping charge.  The shipping charges are much more <br/>
than it would cost to subscribe to them normally.<br/>
