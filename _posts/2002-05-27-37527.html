 </span></blockquote>I can totally relate. I have had a debate with my brother regarding <br/>
homeschooling. He has the same old arguments about socialization, learning to <br/>
deal with the real world, etc. He is obviously very uneducated about <br/>
homeschooling and natural learning, and my attempts to enlighten him, only <br/>
after he asked the questions, failed. The only thing he was right about, is <br/>
despite what he feels about homeschooling, my daughter will learn anyway <br/>
somehow. So, saturday his daughter was here. She didn&#39;t realize that Megan <br/>
was homeschooling. Even though this PITA brother of mine makes comments in <br/>
front of her to me like &quot;we can&#39;t stay, we don&#39;t HOMESCHOOL and have to get <br/>
up in the morning&quot;. I have a feeling he knows what he is missing, and feels <br/>
guilty. But i can&#39;t believe she was asking Megan that she doesn&#39;t go to <br/>
school. I would have loved to chime in, but I didn&#39;t feel it was my place to <br/>
push our beliefs on her. Chances are, she would want to stop going to school, <br/>
and her parents wouldn&#39;t accomodate that. I can only imagine what her daddy <br/>
would say to her questions. I actually feel like i am in a divorce situation, <br/>
with the ex&#39;s bad-mouthing the other parents/choices to the kids. Whereas I <br/>
would avoid criticizing her parent, I am willing to bet my brother would love <br/>
to put our decision down to anyone that will listen!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572729198">Aren&#39;t familys fun sometimes?  My sister is certain my kids will grow <br/>
up to be idiots and that I am secretly degrading her in my thoughts <br/>
because she chose public school for her child.   (Sheesh, I figure <br/>
you do what you&#39;ve got to do, everyone is different, this is MY <br/>
choice, no reflection on anyone else.)  My mother at first was <br/>
totally against it, and now is resigned to it but delights in giving <br/>
me little underhand digs whenever possible ... for example, her <br/>
latest letter contained a sentence stating &quot; So, I suppose now that <br/>
summer is coming, you&#39;ll teach them Something(underlined) during this <br/>
time...&quot;  This was tucked in between &quot;Say Hi to everyone&quot; and &quot;The <br/>
weather has been cold lately&quot;.  I try to tell them as little as <br/>
possible now... it only adds fuel to the fire so to speak.<br/>
