<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107550675">&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t rely on the DaVinci Code for historical data&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nor would I.  I stated that it was fiction and a good starting point if one<br/>
is interested in researching this kind of thing.  I was raised Christian and<br/>
had never even considered some of the things the book brought up, so I<br/>
researched them on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the Christian<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, not just the DaVinci author.  In<br/>
fact, I watched a documentary on Christianity on the Discovery chanel not<br/>
too long ago, within the last year, that went into it in depth.  I believe<br/>
that it is fairly widely believed that Constantine usurped the Pagan<br/>
holidays with the Christian overlay when he decided everyone needed to be<br/>
Christian.  Of course, I believe that he was Pagan until his deathbed, but<br/>
he used Christianity as a ruse to cement his power.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of those things with competing theories.<br/>

It is my understanding from my Bible school days that Jesus wasn&#39;t<br/>

correct?<br/>

Lets remember its not just candy. Candy is only part of it.<br/>
I know when I was little my step father would freak over the use of A-1<br/>
sauce<br/>
on his expensive steak or the amount of ketchup used.<br/>
<br/>
In our home my sons big thing was soda. Why? Cuz my husband used to nag him<br/>
about how fast he drank it and tell him that when it was gone that was it.<br/>
It<br/>
wasn&#39;t the last time I bought it but my son drank it like it was.<br/>
Over several months I pointed out to my husband that he uses a lot creamer,<br/>
Pepsi and requires special peanut butter and only Jam plus others. I told<br/>
him<br/>
that it was fine with me but that it wasn&#39;t right if the rest of us use<br/>
generic<br/>
or are not allowed to purchase special stuff at all. I told him that our son<br/>
is home and not limited on the soda amounts. That when he (my husband) was<br/>
home on the weekends he often drank a 2 liter a day and that when he is at<br/>
work<br/>
his breaks are limited so that was the difference.<br/>
<br/>
We now buy 2-2 liters a week for Dustin rather than 1 and as I sit here they<br/>
are both unopened and purchased last Thursday.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have a feeling that if people try the &quot;full candy bowl&quot;  as an<br/>
&quot;experiment &quot; and the kids pick up on the idea that this is just a temporary<br/>
thing- the<br/>
-&quot;eat it now or it will be gone again&quot; process might kick in and no one will<br/>
have any idea if  it is possible for their family -not the parents and<br/>
certainly not the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true of unschooling and of video game playing and such too.<br/>
If the attitude of the parent is bristly suspicious hostility and an honest<br/>
HOPE that their &quot;experiment&quot; fails so that they can be proven &quot;right,&quot; it<br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are told &quot;We&#39;ll try unschooling for a month or two to see how it<br/>
works&quot; will have parents who say &quot;We used to unschool, and my kids never<br/>
showed<br/>
any burning interest, never started any big projects, and didn&#39;t do any<br/>
academic work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A temporary offer of freedom in a life of limits won&#39;t be handled calmly and<br/>
maturely.  It&#39;s smarter to treat it with the wild abandon it requires, if<br/>
that<br/>
door is closing soon.<br/>

I also thought about something else.  What if you get say, M&M&#39;s and<br/>
everyone<br/>
goes nuts for them, then some hard candy, and it sits for a long time, but<br/>
you<br/>
get something else good again and everyone devours it again?  Would it be<br/>
best to get lots of different kinds?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I went to WAlmart to get leftover Halloween candy and it was ALL<br/>
GONE!!!<br/>
I&#39;ll pick some up at the bulk grocery store instead.<br/>

Lets think of this in an economical way. IF you only get candy that no one<br/>
likes and it sits there, then what a waste of money, but the experiment<br/>
worked.<br/>
Right? IF you get candy that everyone likes and they eat it all up, which<br/>
they<br/>
will, at least for a few days or weeks, then the experiment failed. Right?<br/>
Oh<br/>
wait! That is only two doors! I choose the third, get candy everyone likes,<br/>
they eat it all right off, you keep the bowl filled, they start to realize<br/>
their favorite(s) will always be available, gradually the bowl stays full<br/>
most of<br/>
the time and the experiment works. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subject: Halloween<br/>
<br/>
 If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, then Christians shouldn&#39;t have anything to do<br/>
with it at all. No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>
candy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>
big &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>
system, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>
different<br/>
things, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>
babies<br/>
being baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>
hot<br/>
topic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>
intent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>
statements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>
taking<br/>
them out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>
Halloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>
trick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>
whether it is<br/>
a witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>
fall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>
stipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
decide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>
standard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>
all loving<br/>
and all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire<br/>
world.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen this with things like yogurt. I buy it once in awhile,<br/>

&gt; &gt; when I do, it&#39;s one or two per person in the family, adn the<br/>

Subject: Re: Digest Number 4161<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t rely on The DaVinci Code for historical data. He cites The<br/>
Gnostic Gospels with as much veracity as valid historical documents,<br/>
when the earliest copies of the Gnostic Gospels are dated in the 4th<br/>
century or later. The author claims that early Christians didn&#39;t<br/>
consider the Lord to be God, when early Christians most certainly DID<br/>
consider Him to be just that. I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code, but<br/>
it isn&#39;t an historical treatise by anyone&#39;s measure, and it really<br/>
isn&#39;t all that well written.<br/>
<br/>
As for all these Christian holidays coming out of Paganism...<br/>
actually, I have read a book that refutes this notion. (and can&#39;t<br/>
remember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD<br/>
thesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to<br/>
make a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized<br/>
various Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism.<br/>
According to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of<br/>
these traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity<br/>
got into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>
one of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>
remember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>
my main point.<br/>
<br/>
IF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>
more weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>
Christians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>
trick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>
is All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>
Christmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>
we should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>
followers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>
book &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>
makes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>
off days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>
day, nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
The Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>
named after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>
THAT.<br/>
<br/>
If Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>
through on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>
today&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>
Hallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>
treating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>
or treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>
And they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>
of any other tradition.<br/>

Christmas is<br/>
&gt; Yule, when the Pagans celebrate the coming of the Sun God, born out<br/>
of the<br/>

festival<br/>

Day or Day<br/>
&gt; of the Dead (depending on your particular flavor of Christianity)<br/>
is the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A fictional book that talks about some of this kind of stuff, using<br/>
lots of<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; You see, Hallowe&#39;en is an EVIL holiday. Pagan in origin, and<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only that&#39;s not true.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s Christian in origin, only it&#39;s Catholic in origin, and so it<br/>
isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &quot;CHRISTIAN&quot; in origin, but then very little is, by the narrowest<br/>
definition, except<br/>
&gt; for the strident fictional history they live by.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right! Most of the Christian traditions are CHRISTIAN in origin.<br/>
That&#39;s what the treatise that I mention elsewhere was about. Fact is,<br/>
Catholicism was outright rejected, therefore all the feast days had<br/>
to be rejected, too...Christmas, Easter, Halloween, All Saint&#39;s Day,<br/>
all of them...are celebrations of the Lord&#39;s life or the Church&#39;s<br/>
life and not pagan at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear about the banning of the word Medieval! and<br/>
laughing my head off...sad and funny at the same time. What idiots.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that there are such idiots representing Christianity out in<br/>

actually, who was it said using a word like experiment might throw it<br/>
all off...maybe just put out the candy bowl and let it sit there,<br/>
every day, always replenished, and always give permission if they<br/>

Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
Unfaithful was originally a French movie and I&#39;ve been told that the ending<br/>
was much more conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of the American version is that we can pretty much decide what we<br/>
think they did and debate over it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s why the American film makers did that but who knows.<br/>
;o)<br/>

<br/>
ps. I didn&#39;t put the French version ending here because maybe some people<br/>
don&#39;t want to not know.<br/>
It&#39;ll be much easier to find info. on the movie imo knowing that it&#39;s<br/>
supposedly a classic French movie originally.<br/>

did you ever see Christian Mother Goose? oh, gross. I mean, nauseous.<br/>

<br/>
Especially considering that Mother Goose came about in a Christian<br/>

Subject: homeschooled kids--call for writings<br/>
<br/>
If this announcement is appropriate for your unschooling site, do you have<br/>
an<br/>
email loop and/or message board that this announcement could be sent to?  I’<br/>
d<br/>
like to give as many homeschoolers as possible a chance to submit their<br/>
writing/artwork for publication.  I homeschooled our two boys and now live<br/>
on the<br/>
coast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I have had an idea for<br/>
a<br/>
book for years and am finally pulling it all together!  The book will be a<br/>
beautiful one; I have found nothing similar in my search of books already<br/>
published.  It will show everyone just how incredibly creative and talented<br/>
our<br/>
homeschoolers are.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks<br/>
very<br/>
much.  Kate Jennings<br/>
<br/>
Announcement –<br/>
My name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight years,<br/>
not  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I am compiling<br/>
writings<br/>
by homeschoolers that will show the world just how talented we are!  I am<br/>
accepting (very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive),<br/>
diary<br/>
entries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   Photos and<br/>
drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really<br/>
great. The<br/>
book will be a showcase of the talents that homeschooled students possess.<br/>
Anything written by students would be appropriate, whether it is<br/>
descriptive,<br/>
instructive or creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying<br/>
artwork<br/>
-- photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The<br/>
presentation<br/>
of the writing in the book is very, very important to me, and accompanying<br/>
artwork is very important to the presentation!   One of my favorite<br/>
submissions<br/>
is from a boy whose family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were<br/>
included in the submission.  This entry will be most effective!  Please<br/>
email me<br/>

&lt;snip&gt; Its really easy to find<br/>
&gt; fun, interesting things to do without a lot of money or planning.<br/>
You can<br/>
&gt; throw together great learning activities for young children. When<br/>
they get a<br/>
&gt; little older, the co-op can do so much more that is difficult to<br/>
do without<br/>
&gt; more structure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have had some wonderful classes that involve speakers and field<br/>
experts<br/>
&gt; that would be difficult to schedule. We have access to materials<br/>
that are<br/>
&gt; available to schools, but not always to homeschoolers just because<br/>
they will<br/>
&gt; reach more children. We have gotten grants to pay for some classes<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; materials. We have a permanant meeting place so long term<br/>
commitments can be<br/>
&gt; made. One of my latest thoughts is to try to get appoval to start<br/>
drivers ed<br/>
&gt; classes at the center-in Ohio the kids have to attend a course<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; school or a private driving school, so why not have a school<br/>
program at the<br/>
&gt; center so we don&#39;t all have to pay $300 to the local driving<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
We paid over $200 for an insurance-sponsored, profit-driven &quot;driving<br/>
school&quot; in Louisiana -- typical, conventional week&#39;s worth of wasted<br/>
time.  They insisted that our son should be able to drive on the<br/>
road after six hours of instruction to some arbitrary standard (with<br/>
no other &quot;official&quot; road hours under his belt) -before- issuing a<br/>
learner&#39;s permit (you know, the one you get so you can learn how to<br/>
drive on the road?) and when he &quot;failed&quot; to meet their so-called<br/>
standard, they had the legal right (as a for-profit company offering<br/>
a state-mandated service) to require us to fork over ex-tra bucks<br/>
for ex-tra hours from their ex-pert driving instructor.  What a scam!<br/>
<br/>
Next time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC --<br/>
autodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the<br/>
drug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit --<br/>
then, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed<br/>
driver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents<br/>
sat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>
- white knuckles notwithstanding.)  Common sense and a lot of love<br/>
kept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our<br/>
ability to steer clear of trouble.  Those were the days, my friend...<br/>
<br/>
Here we are in FL -- mandated Traffic Law & Substance Abuse course,<br/>
reasonable priced (under $50) and even available in a convenient<br/>
online version.  Major problem -- the course content on substance<br/>
abuse is highly objectionable (nightmarish to those who have gone<br/>
through the trauma of losing loved ones to DUI) and in conflict with<br/>
our sincerely-held religious beliefs and educational philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Have contacted the HSMV and State Representatives for information on<br/>
a waiver (for the objectionable part of the course, if not all), but<br/>
no go.  Our Senator&#39;s legislative assistant is still looking into<br/>
the matter... maybe.  Once we exhausted the obvious legal<br/>
alternatives, we decided to check out CompuHigh&#39;s offerings and drop<br/>
a line to Pat Montgomery at Clonlara.  Haven&#39;t received a response<br/>
in the past few weeks since our first inquiry, so plan to follow-up<br/>
in a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Will have to see if any of the umbrella schools/co-ops here in FL<br/>
have tackled this one already -- perhaps it&#39;s our turn to take the<br/>
wheel and formalize our relationship to the un/homeschooling<br/>
community by gearing driver&#39;s ed to individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, driving should never be tied into grades, attendance, or<br/>
anything else as a matter of privilege -- it should be recognized as<br/>
a marketable skill, and in some cases, an absolute necessity.  We<br/>
want all who are able to take the initiative to gain this skill<br/>
without compromising their values or welfare in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Advice & suggestions welcome & encouraged!  Hasta luego, Amigos...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it is alot easier for new homeschoolers to find the<br/>
support they<br/>
&gt; need when you have a co-op like this too. They can jump right in<br/>
to a<br/>
&gt; thriving community of homeschoolers instead of winging it on their<br/>
own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Center that we use is quite far from us, so we often do not<br/>
get to<br/>
&gt; participate in many of the activities that interest us. I wish we<br/>
could have<br/>
&gt; them in every community so that more of the wonderful<br/>
opportunities were<br/>
&gt; available to every one who want to learn for life. Not just the<br/>
hsers or<br/>
&gt; even just the kids.<br/>

Good point, Laura.<br/>
It&#39;s not about candy itself, it&#39;s about nagging and judgmentalism about<br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to keep my cousin from having more than one glass of milk with a<br/>
meal.  It was hateful.  She really wanted more milk, that was all.  If she<br/>
ate<br/>
all her other food she MIGHT be allowed to have more milk.  But not without<br/>
her feeling nine kinds of unworthy.<br/>

You&#39;re doing the right thing, even if the transition may be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure of your situation but it might be worthwhile, during the last<br/>
couple of days at the school, for your son to collect phone numbers and<br/>
contact info for his favorite friends there. Unless distance is an issue<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to cut your son off completely from his school friends.<br/>
They can still socialize on weekends, in late afternoons, etc. as the<br/>
situation permits.<br/>

dealing just with England/English/American stuff.   The Catholic church has<br/>
been<br/>
really good about adapting local custom and giving it a religous overlay.<br/>
So<br/>
local observances were maintained but given Christian meanings. It happened<br/>
in<br/>
Rome and Greece, all over Europe.  It&#39;s still done now.  At the Pueblos on<br/>
the<br/>
northern Rio Grande they have traditional dances which have come to be<br/>
associated with Christmas and danced on Christmas eve, with the dancers<br/>
starting in<br/>
the church (or ending there).  Other dances which haven&#39;t been attached to<br/>
Christian holidays start and end in the kiva.<br/>

Right! Most of the Christian traditions are CHRISTIAN in origin.<br/>

Easter (the word itself) is worth looking up.  Any dictionary with<br/>
etymologies or a google search for the etymology of &quot;Easter&quot;:  NOT Christian<br/>
origin.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, about celebrating the resurrection.<br/>
No on &quot;Easter&quot; being of Christian origin.  When they stuck it on that<br/>
weekend, they kept the old name (in England--I don&#39;t know what they call it<br/>
in other<br/>
languages).<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually, there are quite a few historians who do believe that the <br/>
Christian<br/>
<br/>
festivals are based on the Pagan festivals, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When there was a chance to commandeer an existing tradition they did so.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean things like All Saint&#39;s Day and All Hallow&#39;s Eve aren&#39;t <br/>
Christian holidays.  They are.  But if there was an existing tradition, they got kind <br/>
of blended together. <br/>
<br/>
The eggs and bunnies stuff is sometimes used to represent Christian symbols, <br/>
when really they&#39;re from a whole separate thing originally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what we heard -- I grew up in the Methodist church with the <br/>
doctrine of the Trinity, but came across a more logical explanation <br/>
in the teachings of Christian Science (CS) about ten years ago while <br/>
doing an investigation on vaccines.  Found a reference to CS in a <br/>
Mothering Magazine article.  An online CS buddy always points out <br/>
that Jesus stated himself that he was -not- God (&quot;Why callest thou <br/>
me good?  There is none good, but one, that is God.&quot;)  Yet, Jesus <br/>
had no qualms about acknowledging that he was the Son of God, <br/>
according to the Bible (KJV).  <br/>
<br/>
Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer and founder of CS, pointed out that <br/>
Jesus was/is the highest example of the Christ, which is God. That <br/>
may be where some of the confusion came about with the Nicaean <br/>
Council&#39;s conclusion a few hundred years after Jesus&#39; departure.   <br/>
Mrs. Eddy explained that Christ was originally used as an honorary <br/>
title for Jesus, as in Jesus _the_ Christ or Christ Jesus, rather <br/>
than a synonym or &quot;surname.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Fascinating stuff for a conventionally-raised Christian.  MBE&#39;s <br/>
book, _Science & Health with Key to the Scriptures_ (S&H) is now my <br/>
all-time favorite companion to the Bible (and yes, I prefer the KJV <br/>
over the other interpretations, although they&#39;ve all got their <br/>
flaws.)  Not to come across as a thumper or anything, but I&#39;m one of <br/>
those who can claim to have been healed while reading this book.  A <br/>
decade&#39;s worth of suffering the heartbreak of progressively <br/>
crippling psoriasis simply began to fade away before I even noticed <br/>
it -- that was nine years ago this fall to be exact and I&#39;m still <br/>
trying to find the answer to that (divinely natural) miracle.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never believe it was a mere coincidence, although I&#39;ve heard <br/>
every excuse to refute that CS is legit or this particular disease <br/>
was incurable as the doctors all said.  It was certainly a miserable <br/>
burden before I found CS, so I gotta give credit where credit&#39;s <br/>
due.  The last chapter of S&H is filled with testimonies from others <br/>
who were healed in the same way, and according to the record (over <br/>
125 years since S&H was first published,) CS has been known to cure <br/>
every known disease on the planet.  <br/>
<br/>
The fact that I can type on this keyboard (when I could barely hold <br/>
a pencil or dress myself) is living proof to me that there is always <br/>
hope, with a whole lotta faith (understanding, not blind) and love <br/>
in the mix.  There&#39;s a lot of mind over matter lit out there, but <br/>
S&H is the only one that I&#39;ve found which wholly gives the power to <br/>
heal to the one Mind, God.  Mrs. Eddy is also the only one whom <br/>
we&#39;ve found to uphold John&#39;s statement that &quot;God is Love&quot; (not <br/>
subject to human whims, weaknesses, or temper tantrums, but only <br/>
found to be practicing parental perfection, i.e. Love.)  If that&#39;s <br/>
not Taking Children Seriously, nothing is!<br/>
<br/>
After nearly ten years, I&#39;m still hooked on CS if you can&#39;t tell!  I <br/>
love to hear other&#39;s &quot;reason for the hope within,&quot; especially with <br/>
all the frightening mess going on in the world.  This is where CS <br/>
has its finest hour -- allaying fears of all magnitudes -- and <br/>
that&#39;s what heals not only individual physical challenges, but <br/>
spiritual and moral dis-ease on a universal basis.  <br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t matter whether Halloween is classified as pagan or <br/>
Christian, hacker or terrorist fodder -- it&#39;s basically a fright <br/>
night.  Some think that&#39;s a good/holy/fun thing, depending on their <br/>
basic beliefs.  Personally blood and gore, etc., grosses me out, <br/>
faked or otherwise, and the kids feel the same way -- so we try to <br/>
avoid it as much as possible.  The non-stop graphic advertisements <br/>
convinced us to turn off the tube years ago.  At least we have a <br/>
little more control over this medium, but it&#39;s becoming a real toss-<br/>
up with all the invasive pop-ups.<br/>
<br/>
Think of this lengthy three-in-one post as my way of saying we&#39;ve <br/>
missed the unschooling crowd and Sandra Dodd&#39;s words of wisdom -- so <br/>
glad to have caught up with everybuddy on the forum.  Thanks for <br/>
posting my message as a &quot;newbie&quot; unschooling veteran (is that an <br/>
oxymoron? :o) We&#39;re still looking through the responses to the <br/>
driver&#39;s dilemma.  If only Yahoo! hadn&#39;t removed the &quot;Reply to <br/>
Message#&quot; reference link at the bottom of the posts -- makes it <br/>
tough to review the history of a topic.  <br/>
<br/>
I finally figured out that the Digests were the source of many <br/>
replies, so decided the search engine was my best bet (thank <br/>
goodness Yahoo! finally added this feature!)  Guess our son will <br/>
feel better about moving back to FL once he hears about the new law <br/>
in SC (or not!) He has been lamenting that we left just a few months <br/>
before he turned fifteen since his birthday in September.  Still it <br/>
would&#39;ve taken another year to get a full-fledged license (albeit <br/>
restricted) that would transfer over.  <br/>
<br/>
Heard from the Senator&#39;s assistant after posting -- typical &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
the law, conform or get over it&quot; response, but she said she&#39;d pass <br/>
our concerns along to the ever-so-busy legislators.  Is Pat <br/>
Montgomery out of the country?  I expected to hear from someone at <br/>
Clonlara by now.  Back to the drawing/message board and the search <br/>
for umbrellas, coops, etc., to sponsor an independent study driver&#39;s <br/>
course tailored to meet both our needs and the state&#39;s <br/>
requirements.  Until later, Amigos...<br/>

&gt; Joyce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PDA] Whoops! Didn&#39;t mean for it to come across that way -- but <br/>
using a religious quote in any context frightens people more often <br/>
than a ghost story around the campfire.  Although my own &quot;hope&quot; is <br/>
based in Christian Science (CS), I was thinking more along the lines <br/>
of the description of the list on Unschooling.com, which is all-<br/>
inclusive of the worldwide range of conversation we shared way back <br/>
on HEM&#39;s first e-mail list.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it was Earl Gary Stevens who first started mapping out the <br/>
participants -- we had between 50 and 200 max on the listserv back <br/>
then, if I recall correctly, from all points of the States and <br/>
around the globe.  We were awestruck by the magnitude of the <br/>
Internet and its capabilities for networking back then -- little did <br/>
we know! <br/>
<br/>
***Unschooling.com&#39;s e-mail list, a hotbed of conversation. No set <br/>
topics, pretty much anything related to unschooling goes- and we all <br/>
know that means just about everything! Another good way to get to <br/>
know other people, and share opinions and information about all <br/>
sorts of things.*** <br/>
<br/>
And well do we understand that the &quot;reason for the hope within&quot; <br/>
varies just as widely as the locales of the unschooling crowd -- in <br/>
fact, that&#39;s how we first found out about Taking Children Seriously <br/>
and other wonderful ways of trusting each other.  One of the best <br/>
things we learned about CS is that so-called age and status are <br/>
basically irrelevant -- it&#39;s more about stages of growth, not <br/>
physical but spiritual (which again is individual according to <br/>
belief,) and in all fairness -- autodidacts of all ages/stages can <br/>
and should be trusted to direct their own education in the world and <br/>
reason with confidence on relevant topics without fear of judgment <br/>
or censorship.  <br/>
<br/>
Simply stated, thanks for trusting us enough to pass the post along <br/>
to the group despite &quot;off-topic&quot; appearances and offering us a <br/>
chance to clarify.  I searched the forum from top to bottom looking <br/>
for info on driver&#39;s ed courses and the conversation sounded so <br/>
openly familiar that I jumped in as if I&#39;d never left the old <br/>
un/homeschooling list (which has branched off into a million <br/>
directions now.)  <br/>
<br/>
We hope to continue to learn from each other in the same spirit, <br/>
which includes fearlessness in speaking on subjects that aren&#39;t <br/>
always understood for what they&#39;re worth to unschooling -- and no <br/>
matter how it&#39;s defined, &quot;that means just about everything!&quot; has <br/>
value and potential in this world of ours :o)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to be here amongst open-minded buddies ~<br/>

 </span></blockquote>[PDA] I was a theatre and dance major, so I can appreciate the <br/>
benefits of dressing up and costumes, but not necessarily Halloween <br/>
scares.  Our kids create impromptu and elaborate costumes non-stop <br/>
around here, but the stuff they run into one the tele-tube, in the <br/>
night, the mall or even the grocery store (the management and clerks <br/>
have both been known to go overboard with the gorey masks and <br/>
makeup) on Halloween and long beforehand gives &#39;em the heebie-<br/>
jeebies.  A few years back two of our neighbors decorated their <br/>
yards -- one with a guillotine complete with the trimmings and one <br/>
with a monster mask.  <br/>
<br/>
Every time we went out to the van to run errands, the displays <br/>
caught the eye -- you had to make a real effort to avoid this scene <br/>
for an entire month.  Forget playing out in the front yard and the <br/>
window/shelf displays everywhere accost them, too.  Both of these <br/>
families had young daughters (under six) whose elementary school bus <br/>
rode by those yard decorations every day, and one of them actually <br/>
told us her mother had refused to take her trick or treating that <br/>
year because she&#39;d been disturbed all night dealing with nightmares <br/>
after the last fright fest. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that sounds a little sensitive and paranoid, but I never <br/>
liked that kind of thing when I was a kid growing up in the sixties, <br/>
either, and still don&#39;t.  Scariest thing I remember was the older <br/>
teenagers who refused to grow up and cut in on our scene with a bad <br/>
hippy costume and a smiley face button :o) One of the aliens on a <br/>
really lame episode of Star Trek still runs through my mind, too.  <br/>
We dressed up as &quot;cute&quot; witches and ghosts, not gorey goblins from <br/>
another galaxy and it was considered tacky to go to somebody else&#39;s <br/>
neighborhood to trick or treat unless you lived out in the boonies.  <br/>
In that case, you hooked up with a school friend _and_ their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s always Mardi Gras (which has more goodies but can <br/>
get off the wall) and Highland Games/Caleidh, Civil War (Re-<br/>
enactment-toddlers don&#39;t like seeing people get shot and <br/>
maimed)/Antebellum Balls and the Society for Creative Anachronism, <br/>
to name a few other &quot;costume parties&quot; out there which can substitute <br/>
for Halloween if need be.  The possibilities are endless... not to <br/>
mention that we live in the land of make-believe here in central <br/>
Florida, so there&#39;s never a lack of opportunity in that department.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed the thread ... gotta go help my son finish his new kilt (we <br/>
got some genuine Clan Davidson tartan for his birthday) before the <br/>
Games and holiday parties.  Our daughter picked up a pattern for <br/>
Scarlett O&#39;Hara&#39;s barbeque dress when she and her sister <br/>
participated in the Junior Belle program -- strolling the grounds in <br/>
antebellum gowns for a couple of hours at Cypress Gardens -- before <br/>
they closed the park down for lack of funds.  Hopefully, the Gardens <br/>
will reopen soon!<br/>
