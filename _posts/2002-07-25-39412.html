<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093474576"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; By experience with boys has been different, the unschooled boys we know<br/>
&gt; have generally started reading fluently around 10, but there&#39;s been a lot<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest son (11) started reading pretty well at age 7-8. I started with<br/>
the book Teach Your Child to Read in 100 easy lessons when he was about 5.<br/>
He caught on to the whole phonics thing, and seemed to have little trouble<br/>
reading, started with easy readers and worked up to chapter books. He&#39;s not<br/>
a voracious reader, though, but has tackled a thick book if he has a real<br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
My younger son (9) started reading instruction in much the same way and at<br/>
the same age (around 5). But things were so different with him. We also used<br/>
the same 100 easy lessons book, but only made it about 10-20 lessons in and<br/>
were having incredible difficulties and frustrations. He really wanted to<br/>
learn, especially because his older brother could read and learned from the<br/>
same book. But the book didn&#39;t &quot;click&quot; with him like it had with his<br/>
brother. He wasn&#39;t getting phonics AT ALL. Being the good homeschooling mom<br/>
I was ;-), I bought a good, age appropriate phonics workbook to help him<br/>
learn the concepts of sounding out words. Oh, how he struggled to do each<br/>
and every page of that book, and I just didn&#39;t understand why he wasn&#39;t<br/>
getting it. I devised other phonics word games, used index cards to label<br/>
things around the house, and had him read aloud to me. He and I both were so<br/>
frustrated, and I even thought he was purposely being<br/>
stubborn and willfull by NOT &quot;getting&quot; phonics and reading. W even got the<br/>
Phonics game (a gift from my mom) and as you can guess, it did NO good at<br/>
all, in fact it was a big joke IMO, especially after seeing those<br/>
commercials again.<br/>
<br/>
Last year in Sept. I started unschooling and stopped doing all reading<br/>
instruction, workbooks and the like. I left him completely alone and since<br/>
then, in this past year, he has made such progress in learning to read on<br/>
his own. Reading is coming to him, slowly but surely, and I think the thing<br/>
that helped most was me taking the pressure off of him and accepting him<br/>
just as he is, and knowing that he is at the level that *he* is supposed to<br/>
be at right now.<br/>
All thanks to unschooling. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband says that he remembers being exactly the same way in school<br/>
(having difficulty reading) when he was little. In fact, that difficulty<br/>
carried right on through all his school years, and even to this day. My dh<br/>
says he can&#39;t read a book for pleasure, like a fiction book. He says that if<br/>
he reads a chapter and puts the book down, the next time he picks it up he<br/>
forgot the story so far and has to reread the chapter he already read. He<br/>
only reads computer technical manuals to help himself learn specific things,<br/>
but never reads for enjoyment. He attributes this reading handicap to being<br/>
left-handed, and says it&#39;s the same way with my younger son, who is also<br/>
left-handed. We know other kids who have reading/learning difficulties and<br/>
most if not all just happen to be left-handed and it goes along with his<br/>
theory - that left-handed people have a harder time learning things in<br/>
general, at least in &quot;normal&quot; ways. Well, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not<br/>
and I tell him it&#39;s not fair to generalize and stereotype people that way.<br/>
But that&#39;s his opinion.<br/>

have more trouble reading, just like in general girls read earlier and easier <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231610569">Regarding handedness:<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest uses both hands equally.  He eats meals with a fork in one hand<br/>
and a spoon in one hand, which does not bother me, but it drives my mother<br/>
nuts, because I am not teaching him how to eat, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I used to think, cool, he is ambidextrous (sp??).  But no, we had<br/>
him evaluated by a Occupational therapist when he was 3, when we found out<br/>
he had delays in his fine motor skills.  The part about using both of his<br/>
hands was fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
It seems he was &quot;not crossing midline&quot;.  Meaning, anything on his left hand<br/>
side he would use his  left hand for, and anything on his right side he<br/>
would just use his right hand for.  This is not ambidextrous.  Ambidextrous<br/>
(and I am sure I am completely screwing up the spelling, sorry), is when you<br/>
lets say eat with your left (always), and throw a ball with your right<br/>
(always), etc...<br/>
<br/>
In my son&#39;s case, it has a large part to do with his brain, he has extremely<br/>
poor vision, and a crossed eye, which is also a brain condition, and not an<br/>
eye condition.<br/>
<br/>
Just interesting.<br/>

Cameron performed magic for several years and had to learn many tricks with <br/>
both hands. It took a little longer with the left hand, but he said that it <br/>
was just a matter of concentrating really hard---that the KNOWLEDGE of how to <br/>
do the trick was in his head, but that he had to really THINK hard to send <br/>
the message down to this left fingers. After he was &quot;sure&quot; that the fingers <br/>
could get the message, he knew that he could do the trick with either <br/>

I put mascara on the right eye with the right hand and the left eye with the <br/>
left hand. It used to get a laugh in college. My friends would turn their <br/>
right arms kind of upside down and backwards to get the left eyes. I also <br/>
paint and draw equally well with the left hand, although I&#39;m a righty. I&#39;ll <br/>
have to look up &quot;crossing over&quot;. In baseball, I have to catch with my right <br/>

was never picked for base/softball teams! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

my Mom sent which was his first book, or any of those easy books.  I think<br/>

literature and other possible non-phonetic methods (like games...but the <br/>
games do seem to be phonetically oriented since reading is not presented in <br/>

phonetic oriented exposure complicate or enhance or can go either <br/>

My first learned to read at school. My two next children who are now very <br/>

tapes and look at the books. That&#39;s how they learned phonics. They also were <br/>
into workbooks like a year or two ago. I found a site on the internet where <br/>
I printed out worksheets for them where they would have to insert the <br/>
correct letter for a picture. It started out with beginning letters, then <br/>
the end and eventually middle and also blends. My kids must have went <br/>
through at least 50 worksheets each. Then they just put them all away and <br/>
literally walked away from the &quot;reading.&quot; About 4 months ago, they both just <br/>
started to read small words and now read quite well. My husband who is a <br/>
strong supporter of unschooling is amazed everytime he hears them reading. <br/>
Mostly because he never has seen me sit and teach them. The one that really <br/>
is astonished is my almost 17 year old. She thinks all we do all day is <br/>
play! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

the pressure to perform.  My daughter is no way interested in worksheets, so <br/>
I&#39;ve dropped them....for now?  I&#39;ve noticed that she really prefers to make <br/>
her own discoveries....figure things out herself.  She is my teacher in that <br/>
respect...she will not allow me to take over her path and her way.   I&#39;m <br/>
gathering from the beginnings of my reading of John Holt that he believes <br/>
that phonics actually interfers with learning to read...maybe I am wrong in <br/>
that assumption. (Not that I am much of a follower of anyone...just I can see <br/>
where that could happen, but maybe not always.)  Maybe I am wondering just <br/>
what to have available for her and how?  <br/>

for adults and I noticed that most were stumbling and struggling their way <br/>
through each word...hung up on each individual sound.  Each little sound was <br/>
an entity unto itself....Seems like in your situation that you were giving a <br/>
boost and explanation for the words that your child needed/wanted an <br/>
explanation for....now that I can see making sense (to me) within the <br/>
unschooling philosophy.The words come first, then tools as and if needed and <br/>
wanted to &quot;clear the path?&quot;  <br/>

If the parent is conversational, casual, and can handle a total lack of <br/>

&lt;&lt;Does acknowledgement of and focus on the little separate parts of <br/>

<br/>
Not if the kid has an interest in it and the parent doesn&#39;t seem desperate, <br/>
in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
My kids liked &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; which is a cassette tape with a folder <br/>
(cardboard illustration) for a song that goes <br/>
Apple, apple, a, a, a<br/>
Apple, apple, a, a, a<br/>
Baby, baby, buh, buh, buh<br/>
Baby, baby, buh, buh, buh<br/>
<br/>
We still sing it sometimes just because it comes up for some reason, or to <br/>
try to get through and remember all the 26 examples they had.<br/>
<br/>
And one of Holly&#39;s first Adobe Photoshop projects was to scan that really <br/>
worn out and taped cardboard visual aid and repair it.  We have an extra tape <br/>
but didn&#39;t have an extra of the &#39;song,&#39; so someday we&#39;ll pass that on.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just wondering if, regardless of tone and intent, pointing out a fact <br/>
(sound, <br/>
in this case) robs a child of the possibility of self-discovery and pure <br/>
&quot;ownership&quot; of a know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would that go for everything?  Patterns in nature?  Geography?  Bird <br/>
watching?  <br/>
Do you intend to never point out ANYTHING that&#39;s interesting?  A new tomato <br/>
on the vine?  The big gross tomato worm?  (We finally got one this year, and <br/>
Holly had never seen one, but we opted out of keeping it for transformation.  <br/>
We thought we&#39;d leave it on the vine and watch it.  ONE DAY later a whole <br/>
plant was eaten up, so we relocated him into a vacant lot, but didn&#39;t stay to <br/>
see the birds find him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting figuring out where our threshholds are on different things.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always played rhyming games in the car just for fun, and number games, <br/>
and had tapes in to sing along and some of those had &quot;educational content&quot; <br/>
and we always managed to enjoy and glean coolness from the most base or vile <br/>
or goofy stuff as well.<br/>
<br/>
If a word looks like or sounds like another word, and if the kid is right <br/>
there anyway (looking for other words that are a lot like &quot;Holly&quot; and I point <br/>
out &quot;jolly&quot;) that&#39;s not different from &quot;Eeyew!  A tomato worm!&quot; or &quot;Look at <br/>
the frost patterns on the windshield!&quot;   *if* the family is accustomed to <br/>
finding happy joy in little discoveries anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411318886">I think phonics is simply ONE way SOME people learn to read.  Other people<br/>
use other ways, most people probably use a combination of ways.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics drives my 9yo ds insane.  He is very much the kind of kid who gets<br/>
an idea in his head and then has trouble if he has to shift gears.  Plan A<br/>
is Plan A is Plan A, even if it is obvious to even him that it isn&#39;t<br/>
working.  Shifting to Plan B is a long and tedious task.  So when &quot;come&quot; is<br/>
pronounced &quot;cum&quot; and &quot;home is pronounced &quot;hoam&quot; it drive him nuts and he<br/>
completely quit working on reading.<br/>
<br/>
He does much better simply recognizing the shapes of words.  He is now<br/>
reading lots of signs, candy wrappers, television listings....nothing that<br/>
even remotely resembles a book I think because me pushing phonics on him<br/>
years ago really freaked him out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449199166">I think that English is way harder to learn ---if you are going to <br/>
rely on phonics alone. I taught Spanish to college students for 7 <br/>
years and what I found most interesting of the process was that, the <br/>
American students who were never exposed to a second language would <br/>
end the semester or the year having to re-learn English. They lacked <br/>
the tools for making those leaps from their language to a new one. <br/>
The leaps that would help them in making connections with the new <br/>
language and, hopefully, ground them in the new vocabulary and new <br/>
way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
It was during my stint at NYU and Rutgers that came as a shock to me <br/>
that schools spend little if not no time dealing with English from an <br/>
orthographical, syntactical or etymological point of view. It&#39;s like <br/>
there are these words you have to learn how to use, for better or <br/>
worse, in a way that remains magical and mysterious. There is no <br/>
sense that words are these plastic things that you can actually build <br/>
and use as raw material for building worlds. There is no sense that <br/>
words have their own biographies; their own histories. That you can <br/>
learn about a country or a culture by the way that they use a word.<br/>
<br/>
Words can be an exciting and fascinating world unto themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  Shifting gears is hard for a lot of people (like me!).  May be &quot;stuff&quot; <br/>
has to fall in place (in its own time)in the brain before a shift can take <br/>
place(readiness?)....and then the shift may not be to Plan B.  I think this <br/>
is where the trust and letting go comes in and that&#39;s hard to do when one is <br/>
concerned for their child and not feeling secure about it all.  I&#39;m reading <br/>
John Holt&#39;s &quot;Learning All the TIme,&quot; and he talks abouit how nutty phonics <br/>
can be...now I have develped phonic phobia!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still shifting, unlearning, relearning...whatever....!  <br/>
