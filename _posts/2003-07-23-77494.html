<div id="ygrps-yiv-962128680">________________________________________&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Message: 18&lt;br&gt;   Date: Wed, 23 Jul 2003 14:38:19 EDT&lt;br&gt;   From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>&lt;br&gt;Subject: Jeva and accusations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does anyone here know who Jeva is?  She described herself on another list as &lt;br&gt;&quot;a former victim of Sandra Dodd&quot; and now she&#39;s telling people she doubts I &lt;br&gt;write my own essays.  That&#39;s probably actionable stuff, and I&#39;d like to know who &lt;br&gt;she is.  Since she won&#39;t even tell this list whether she&#39;s an unschooler, I&#39;m &lt;br&gt;assuming she&#39;s someone who&#39;s been here before and came back under another name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you think anyone will believe the doubt she is trying to cast on my &lt;br&gt;integrity?  It&#39;s a shame, character assassination just for personal amusement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the quotes about the writings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Yes, you have the right to say what you feel, and so do we. I stated  &lt;br&gt;&gt; what I felt about the possibility of Sandra not being the true author  &lt;br&gt;&gt; and I meant it. My comments are not a personal attack, but an honest  &lt;br&gt;&gt; take on my experience with the assumed author&#39;s personality and the  &lt;br&gt;&gt; contents of the articles. It&#39;s an opinion, not an insult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; My comments, are no different that anyone who would review an article  &lt;br&gt;&gt; or it&#39;s author. I was actually neutral on the contents and all I  &lt;br&gt;&gt; stated was that I don&#39;t feel Sandra is the actual author. I may be  &lt;br&gt;&gt; wrong or right, but I  do have the right to question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeva&lt;br&gt;pink lantern &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pinklantern@...">pinklantern@...</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone knows her real name, could you e-mail me on the side?  Accusations &lt;br&gt;that I have passed someone else&#39;s words off as my own (plagiarism) or taken &lt;br&gt;money on false pretenses (fraud) are pretty serious accusations.  Baseless, and &lt;br&gt;reckless, and they serve NO useful purpose for the accuser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY real name is Sandra Dodd.  I&#39;ve never hidden.  &lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never avoided direct questions about my children or my unschooling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s pretty sad that I&#39;m being attacked by a troublemaker in a disguise.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I don&#39;t know who Jeva&#39;s is but I just wanted to say it sounds like somebody is jealous. I don&#39;t post often, I&#39;m lucky to find the time to read and post on a couple of boards, but I enjoy reading the posts when I can. I must say tho I have decided you must be a pretty interesting person becuz of all the emotions you stir in people. <br/>
<br/>
I write poetry sometimes and use to feel bad becuz some people would say they found my writing to be very disturbing or too loaded, then someone told me that&#39;s a good thing becuz I was able to actually have an effect on the reader. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s far better to live making a few ripples than never to have been noticed:-)<br/>

I like this.  I bet you write beautiful poetry, Darlene.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;ve been reading what you&#39;ve written for almost two years, now.  I&#39;ve often wondered how you got so much wisdom.  Never once did I think you stole your words from someone else.  If someone reads your essays and then what you write on the daily boards and lists they would have no doubt that you live what you say and that your words are your own.  <br/>

Thanks!  That&#39;s a good way to look at it.<br/>
I wish there were a way to stir the emotions of the sane without disturbing <br/>
the surface of the crazed.<br/>

Thanks.  <br/>
I figured this stuff out gradually, sometimes crying in my room as a kid, <br/>
sometimes reading the Bible during the sermon and figuring out what the preacher <br/>
was saying was way out of context, sometimes feeling all the angst of a young <br/>
teacher who knows the world can&#39;t be changed.  There were a few other things <br/>
as well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
