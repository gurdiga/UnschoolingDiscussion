&lt;&lt;   But, I saw my husband laugh <br/>
 with the kids tonight and tell them silly riddles.  And I took my nine year <br/>
 old and his brother to Wal-Mart tonight to buy Star Wars toys which they <br/>
 don&#39;t need, but love to play with.  I played ball outside with my kids <br/>
 yesterday.  I saw the full moon with them tonight.  I&#39;ve gone for a walk <br/>
with <br/>
 my dh four nights in a row.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaah....sounds like you&#39;re on your way.<br/>
Keep connecting to that joy within, to those wonderful moments and things <br/>
will just keep getting better.<br/>
Glad to have you here.<br/>
