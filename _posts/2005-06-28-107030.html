<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823551071">DH and DS are home all week together while I&#39;m at work (I WOH <br/>
fulltime, DH is home fulltime). Both are Spirited personalities so <br/>
they can &#39;lock in&#39; and battle ensues. What we&#39;ve done is program <br/>
DH&#39;s cell phone to have my work phone number on speed dial (push 2 <br/>
and the green Dial button and voila - there&#39;s Mommy!). Before things <br/>
escalate too far, one or the other will call (DS can handle the <br/>
speed dial easily, he&#39;s 7). I can talk to DS, check out the <br/>
situation from his perspective, talk to DH and check his <br/>
perspective, then provide a suggestion or two as &#39;discussion fodder&#39; <br/>
to help them start to work out the situation - often they just need <br/>
help &#39;unlocking&#39; from their positions to come up with creative ideas <br/>
to get to a win/win situation. For instance, a month or so ago, DS <br/>
called with a &quot;problem&quot; - he wanted to stay home, DH wanted to go <br/>
out to pick up lunch somewhere (he just needed to be out of the <br/>
house for a bit). DS called me at work. He explained what the <br/>
situation was. I asked what it was that he liked about being home, <br/>
what he didn&#39;t like about going out, those kinds of things to get <br/>
his view of the situation. Then I suggested that, since the closest <br/>
fast food is maybe a 30 minute round trip total, DH could go and <br/>
pick up food and bring it home. DS could stay home with the cell <br/>
phone to call me if he needed something (it takes me 10 minutes to <br/>
drive home from work - probably less in a major emergency cause I&#39;d <br/>
speed!) - or he could even just talk to me while DH was gone if it <br/>
made him more comfortable (notes: we live in a rural area but on a <br/>
main road, not isolated but not a lot of people around either and we <br/>
have 2 large dogs and DS has stayed on his own for short periods <br/>
already). He was okay with that and said Thanks Love you Bye and I <br/>
talked to DH and explained the situation as DS saw it and what we <br/>
had discussed, and DH was okay with it too. I called a couple hours <br/>
later to see how things went (DS didn&#39;t feel a need to call me). <br/>
They were at a local dam/lake area! Once they got &#39;unstuck&#39;, they <br/>
decided to go get fast food then go to this area that they really <br/>
like - quiet, space to run, waterfall/spillway, ducks and other <br/>
waterfowl, nice spot all in all. They ended up spending a few hours <br/>
there. DH got to be out of the house, DS got his feelings and needs <br/>
heard and got to be at a quiet spot where he could play. Everyone <br/>
wins!<br/>
<br/>
Since then, and more each day, they are getting better at doing this <br/>
kind of thing on their own. Perhaps, if you can be available by <br/>
phone some of the time, you could help them develop the skills to <br/>
work things out - talk to your DD and see what it is she is <br/>
thinking/feeling/needing, then talk with your DH and see what his <br/>
perspective is and propose options (small glass of milk; offer <br/>
option milk or cheesecake and let her decide it; make a Dairy chart <br/>
that she is in charge of so she can track how much she&#39;s had and <br/>
where her comfort line is; etc).</div>

&gt; Well, Dh had refused to allow her a drink of milk with her lunch.  I <br/>
&gt; guess the struggle elevated to the point that Dh hid the jug of milk <br/>
&gt; out of reach on top of the refrigerator (this is where I found it <br/>
&gt; when I came home.) <br/>

and check on her?<br/>
Is there some kind of Lact-Aid for kids?<br/>

occurred on Sundays while I&#39;m away.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next.  <br/>
Suggestions?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Calling more, letting it slide, helping her with phrases she might use to <br/>
trigger her dad&#39;s cooperation, just discussing it with her later, the next day, <br/>
and helping empower her to communicate directly with him, instead of reviewing <br/>
it all in front of both of them and making him feel less like being with her <br/>
by your rules.     I&#39;ve had the same kinds of problems, but over the years my <br/>
husband is more likely to be less like his parents and more like Holly&#39;s own <br/>
personal dad.   (And Marty&#39;s, and Kirby&#39;s.)<br/>
