This list is what it is.  If people come here and think it sucks why do<br/>
they stay?<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I have only been here a short time and I have found it to be <br/>
a very good tool while I am just getting started on my unschooling <br/>
path.  It is a very important goal for me and I have a lot to let go of <br/>
to get there.  The honesty and simplicity with which my requests have <br/>
been answered is causing me to look at my self closely.  That&#39;s not <br/>
easy and I suppose one needs to be ready to do that in order for it to <br/>
be helpful.  I for one am grateful to be able to bend the ear of other <br/>
folks who are living in a style I want for myself.<br/>
<br/>
as for the slug discussion, I have a friend who greeted both my new <br/>
babies with &#39;Well, hello there lump!&#39;  I thought it was such a cool <br/>
welcome the first time, and very welcome and familiar the second.  Made <br/>
me think of homemade gravy or something.  They are lumps! soft, round, <br/>
often wet and milky but warm.<br/>
