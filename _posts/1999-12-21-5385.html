<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828445682">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, I am new and would like to introduce myself.  My name is Leslie and I have two boys(5 and 2).  The whole potty training thing has been a struggle for my oldest.  He&#39;s had chronic constipation since he was 18 months old and because of this, was afraid to go on the potty.  I took him to a pediatrician who&#39;s physician&#39;s assistant was looking at him problem as an excuse to put him medication, i.e. Ritalin.  <br/>
 <br/>
We tried everything for potty training, videos, music, books, stickers. If I had a nickel for every time I read, Once Upon A Potty!  Anyway, when we finally got his constipation problem at bay, I took him to a specialist for the training.  She told me to put him in regular underwear during the day.  When he sat on the potty, he got a star sticker and when he peed or pooped, he got a Spongebob sticker.  The first week or so was rough but he finally just did it one day and hasn&#39;t had an accident since.  Although I do think the program I took him to was a good program, I just think he was finally ready to do it.  Most of the frustration for both of us was the pressure from friends and family to &quot;get him trained&quot; especially after he turned five in March.  I started the whole thing telling people that he was the type of child that did things when he was good and ready to do them.  I wished I would have adhered to that idea.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know why it is so hard for some people to view children as human beings and not puppets or robots that need to be controlled.  Just my two cents on the topic.  Hope it wasn&#39;t too long.<br/>
 <br/>
Leslie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091199369">Hi Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that your 5 year old was having difficulty potty <br/>
training and that he had chronic constipation.  As I am sure you have <br/>
found out the two go hand in hand.  If the colon is impacted it can <br/>
effect the urinary tract as well.   I have heard of other older <br/>
children having problems with potty training.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter, who is 14, has suffered greatly due to a rare <br/>
congenital disease called Hirschsprungs disease (Nerve cells in her <br/>
colon never developed) One of the symptoms is constipation which has <br/>
lead to Chronic Mega-colon.   We belong to different support groups <br/>
that give educational and emotional support for parents who have <br/>
children with constipation and other digestive problems.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that your son has the same serious condition that our <br/>
daughter has, however it may be an advantage for you to glean from <br/>
other parents who deal with different soiling issues on a daily <br/>
basis.  You may end up finding someone who has walked your path and <br/>
has found solutions.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I hope you and your family are able to gracefully find answers and <br/>
solutions.  Please feel free to e-mail me personally.<br/>
<br/>
With much warmth,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll second this excellent advice. This is something my DS really <br/>
struggled with and still does, to some extent. At age 4, he was <br/>
evaluated for Hirschsprungs disease, because his pediatrician thought <br/>
that his issues were serious enough, that might be what it was. He <br/>
potty trained relatively late (after 4), and with difficulty, but in <br/>
reality his bowels have never ever been normal. Discovering his dairy <br/>
allergy helped a *lot* because when he was eating dairy it really <br/>
slowed everything down even more. It was just after removing dairy <br/>
from his diet that he was finally able to potty train. I was just <br/>
having a conversation the other day though with a friend whose <br/>
daughter has Hirschprungs about the fact that there are more problems <br/>
along the continuum than just that or nothing. He might still have <br/>
motility or other issues that are causing problems. She is on a list <br/>
that includes Hirschprungs and also motility issues. Might be worth <br/>
doing a Google search for.<br/>
<br/>
In general, we just try to keep him mindful of what he is eating - <br/>
make sure he doesn&#39;t have more than one banana a day (boy does that <br/>
do a number on him if he does), and remind him to drink fluids if he <br/>
forgets, that kind of thing. Because this can be a painful and <br/>
disruptive condition, as well as something kids can be embarassed <br/>
about (or other people can try to make them embarassed about), it can <br/>
be a hard thing to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I felt pretty justified when my 2nd kid potty <br/>
trained herself at 18 months. At least then people couldn&#39;t say it <br/>
was somehow my fault that my son had so many difficulties with it. <br/>
When they&#39;re ready, they&#39;re ready, and for some kids it comes years <br/>
later than others, but it&#39;s a good idea to make sure there isn&#39;t a <br/>
medical condition or allergy that is causing or exacerbating the <br/>
difficulty.<br/>
