<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904691160">Well so far it&#39;s not with my daughter, it&#39;s with my husband. My daughter is <br/>
still asking me what time she has to be in. She&#39;s just not getting it and <br/>
said she feels like this is some kind of test and she doesn&#39;t want to flunk. <br/>
(for those not up to date, she goes to school)<br/>
I just had to laugh at her.<br/>
<br/>
I told my husband tonight and that didn&#39;t go over well at all. Maybe it had <br/>
something to do with him going with the police to get this ex of our <br/>
daughter&#39;s served with a restraining order, a kid that his parents care <br/>
nothing about and let him run helter skelter.<br/>
<br/>
So he told me he didn&#39;t want to talk about it because I would get upset and <br/>
so would he and my mind was made up anyway. Then he said I was wrong and I <br/>
was making a mistake. Later in the house he asked if we could talk about <br/>
this later. I told him not if he couldn&#39;t get out of his narrow mind and <br/>
think beyond the little box he was in. He apologized for what he said and <br/>
agreed to listen to what I had to say tonight. Not sure he&#39;ll see my point <br/>
but I&#39;ll try.<br/>
<br/>
He just feels like we are responsible for Tara at all times when she&#39;s out <br/>
and what if something happens and he does feel like something is more likely <br/>
to happen in the wee hours of the morning than at 12:00 at night. Not <br/>
necessarily with her but involving someone else. He feels like we&#39;re not <br/>
being responsible by letting her come and go as she pleases.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see where this one goes. If I need help, I&#39;ll be yelling!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656855599">If it helps any, I never had a curfew. I did have a rule that I had to let my parents know who I was with and the general plans I had. I also was told that if I ever abused it by getting into trouble, getting drunk, etc that I would get a curfew. I stayed out til the wee hours lots of times, but it was always good honest (if not always clean) fun with my friends. I never got in any trouble and I never got into drinking or drugs even though a lot of my friends were into both. <br/>
<br/>
The difference may have been that I almost always was with a steady boyfriend who would stand by me and protect me if necessary. There are many times I could have been in some seriously sticky situations that moments before were completely innocent if I had not had my boyfriend with me. Girlfriends tend to run off when trouble starts. <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what I&#39;ll do for curfews with my kids. I&#39;d love to be able to follow the &quot;no curfew if you earn/keep my trust&quot; rule but the way things are nowdays, I just don&#39;t know. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Good luck figuring it out!<br/>

<br/>
I plan on using some of this also when I talk to my husband tonight. I never <br/>
had a curfew either and never really stayed out late, Maybe right before <br/>
2:00 on just a few occasions. My mom always new where I was even though <br/>
there were no cell phones or beepers in those days. I did do some drinking <br/>
and drugging but nothing that eve got me into trouble and I graduated top 10 <br/>
of my class. My husband had a curfew and was very heavy into drinking and <br/>
drugs at a very young age. He just did it all before he had to be home. I <br/>
plan on using this too tonight!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just really hard with teenagers nowadays and I guess a lot of it <br/>
depends on where you live too and what the kids are doing. Being that I know <br/>
she&#39;s with her boyfiend makes me feel a lot safer. I truse him with her to <br/>
keep her safe and he seems very smart about where he wants to go and how to <br/>
get there. He&#39;s a bit older in more ways than one. He was mapping out a <br/>
pension plan to my daughter the other day. Totally freaked her out!!! So <br/>
that helps me too. Not sure if she was just out in a car with a bunch of <br/>
girls that I would feel as safe for her.<br/>
<br/>
Time will tell but she does seem like she doesn&#39;t want to mess up this <br/>
chance she&#39;s been given.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079806447">Mary, <br/>
Hope your talk went good last night!!! Yes, I agree where you live would have a lot to do with it! I&#39;d be much more likely to let my kids stay out til whenever if we still lived in our close-knit county in Tennessee where we knew most of the people and they knew us, than I would be here near the big impersonal city of Columbia, SC.<br/>
