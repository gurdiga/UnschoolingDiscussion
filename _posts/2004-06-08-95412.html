That kind of thing. Can unschooling be  unschooled?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I saved this to answer later---and now it&#39;s later. Sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I think the problem is that too many of us were schooled. Those of us who  <br/>
have finally DEschooled are being called upon to answer questions from those who <br/>
 are still brainwashed by school and society to &quot;teach&quot; them how to  UNschool.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s easy to UNschool unschooling if you&#39;ve never been to school.  <br/>
But the vast majority----if not ALL---of those approaching us here have been to  <br/>
school. And presently they have no other &quot;way&quot; to accept  or receive new <br/>
information. So, they&#39;re more comfortable with a more  teacher-y approach?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not exactly clear that I&#39;m exactly clear! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
But I think that unschooling might not be able to be unschooled, unless  <br/>
you&#39;ve BEEN unschooled----and then why would you need to learn it---or even have  <br/>
it unschooled? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe Joyce could decipher what I&#39;m thinking and make it make sense!  Hah!<br/>

<br/>
Good, Kelly.   Thanks.  That question kinda slipped by without enough <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If people don&#39;t change the trajectory they&#39;re on, they don&#39;t arrive at <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If one leaves Los Angeles headed for Chicago and starts to complain when the <br/>
corn fields come that they really wanted to go to Texas, or Oregon, they will <br/>
need to get OFF that train and start a new way, in a new direction.   Really <br/>
off the train.  Not just staying on the old course, but talking about <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And if one of the values of unschooling is time and experimentation, whether <br/>
someone wants to take their time depends on what they want for their kids.  <br/>
Putting their kids on a train to Chicago while they consider never putting a <br/>
child on a train of ANY sort is impossible to undo.<br/>
<br/>
(Anyone who&#39;s in or near Chicago which will keep this analogy from working <br/>
should use Albuquerque, or Cucamunga, or Saskatoon.   Ah... I *so* need to speak <br/>
in Cucamunga.  I&#39;ve done the other two.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274663660">I&#39;m fairly new here, and haven&#39;t posted much yet, but I was hoping for some<br/>
feedback.  My 7 yo dd (whom I call Odette online) has been fascinated with<br/>
ghosts for the past few months, inspired by seeing the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot; and<br/>
a visit to the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose (which is thought to be<br/>
haunted).  Ever since, she&#39;s been reading every ghost-related book she can<br/>
get her hands on, and practices her ghost-hunting skills regularly.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Recently, she read about a ghost-related workshop that she wants to attend,<br/>
which has now inspired her to *teach* a ghost-hunting class for kids.  She<br/>
has picked a date, has been thinking about what she plans to cover, made a<br/>
flyer about the class, and is ready to distribute them.  : )  Very<br/>
cool...except...many parents are not comfortable with this topic.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to inhibit her initiative at all, but I also realize that she might<br/>
receive some unexpected/negative responses.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question for you all is:  Would it be more supportive to talk with<br/>
her about people&#39;s varied beliefs regarding ghosts in advance or wait and<br/>
see what happens?<br/>

saying she is thinking about unschooling, means she is considering it, <br/>
thinking about how it fits her family life, or maybe is in mid-leap off the train. <br/>
<br/>
       What&#39;s offered here to meet that specific need leaves me in <br/>
slack-jawed awe! :)<br/>
<br/>
       But it isn&#39;t the only kind of unschooling discussion I&#39;m interested <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
       My own &quot;thinking about unschooling&quot; doesn&#39;t call for pushing me past <br/>
some detour or distraction that&#39;s preventing me from living unschooling with my <br/>
own family; we got off the train 15 years ago and love living where we wound <br/>
up. <br/>
<br/>
       I get that this isn&#39;t most people&#39;s cup of tea, to wonder if <br/>
unschooling can be unschooled, or what our culture might be like if unschooling <br/>
principles were widely adopted, or to search for how to get through to mainstream <br/>
folk that unschooling might be a really good thing for THEM and their goals, as <br/>
another way to reach more children before it&#39;s too late. Just because we&#39;re off <br/>
the train doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t move!<br/>
<br/>
       This is the only unschooling list I&#39;ve ever been on, and I am new <br/>
here. Maybe it isn&#39;t the place to discuss that kind of thinking and I&#39;d understand <br/>
if not.  But I hope that helps explain what I&#39;m usually thinking, and what I <br/>
meant by asking. :)  JJ<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better place.  It&#39;s a hard question.  Let&#39;s discuss <br/>
it here.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are luckiest, I think, can reflect back on lots of things they <br/>
learned on their own in an unschooling, independent, burning curiosity way.  Or <br/>
even a casual contact kind of way.  But those who can remember learning outside <br/>
of school (or in school, under the desk; or despite school&#39;s real intent) <br/>
probably find that a quick shortcut to having faith that kids could learn those <br/>
ways even better if they didn&#39;t have school to distract them.<br/>
<br/>
I have always learned a lot on my own, but I don&#39;t think that makes me an <br/>
lifelong unschooler.<br/>
(Another topic, I suppose, but I never say &quot;I&#39;ve been unschooling my kids <br/>
since they were born,&quot; even though they didn&#39;t go to school at all.  I don&#39;t feel <br/>
comfortable when people make spurious or exaggerated claims, and while the <br/>
explanations some have made of why they say &quot;unschooling&quot; early make sense, but <br/>
I&#39;m still counting from that fateful day when Kirby did not go to Kindergarten <br/>
with the rest of the kids his age.)<br/>
<br/>
So if someone has a life history of learning easily because of curiosity, <br/>
hobby, reading, interviewing people who .... no, minutely interrogating people <br/>
who move to their little town from bigger places &lt;g&gt;...   well, it just makes <br/>
unschooling that much better.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe unschooling comes sometimes in therapeutic ways.  We talk to people <br/>
about their memories and the realize that they CAN unearth and dust off <br/>
sufficient gradual build-up that forms a foundation for something they can do pretty <br/>
effortlessly and soon!<br/>
<br/>
The first time I spoke at a conference, I passed out a &quot;pretest.&quot;  <br/>
It asked a few questions, and one was to name something the person learned <br/>
entirely outside of school that they could either teach others or make a living <br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have  never thought of that question in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Can we share some of those things here?  I&#39;ll start another topic-name for it.<br/>

some of the explanations for starting counting at birth make sense. She <br/>
said that when people DO make spurious or exaggerated claims it makes <br/>
her uncomfortable and since she is aware that it &quot;could&quot; come across to <br/>
people that she is exaggerating, trying to make it sound like she has <br/>
more years of experience as an unschooling parent - to try to impress <br/>
people more, she is extra careful and wary of that so she continues to <br/>
start &quot;counting&quot; from the time the kids don&#39;t go to school rather than <br/>
from when they are born.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I count from when they didn&#39;t go to school because it is confusing <br/>
otherwise. My oldest went to school from 5 to 9 years old. Should I <br/>
count the time BEFORE she went to school as unschooling and add that to <br/>
the time after we took her out? I should if I&#39;m going to count my <br/>
never-went-to-school daughter&#39;s entire life. When people ask, &quot;How long <br/>
have you been homeschooling?&quot; it would be confusing and misleading to <br/>
most people if you just give the child&#39;s age. So I don&#39;t.<br/>

I suppose I could with Holly, since she was born after Kirby was <br/>
homeschooling, but I never assumed Marty and Holly would necessarily stay home.  I <br/>
honestly assumed Marty would want to go to school, because he liked doing what Kirby <br/>
didn&#39;t do.   But when the time came he wanted to stay home.   And I liked it <br/>
SO much that he was there entirely of his own free will that I gave Holly the <br/>
same option when she got older, but by then I was really hoping she would stay <br/>
home.  She did.<br/>
<br/>
So what I do say is &quot;My kids have never been to school, and the oldest is 17.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I understand both points of view. My decision is to call us Unschoolers even<br/>
though Jayn is still below the legal age.<br/>
<br/>
We had decided to homeschool before Jayn was born. We joined a newly formed<br/>
local support group when Jayn was 18 months old, three years ago, and I had<br/>
already been on the HSC list. I was reading John Holt, but had not really<br/>
had the courage or understanding to commit to unschooling until Pam<br/>
Sorooshian let me know about this list - but I don&#39;t remember exactly when<br/>
that was.<br/>
<br/>
I have to call myself an Unschooler, and have done for a while, as I am<br/>
surrounded by people who are most emphatically not unschoolers in my hs<br/>
group. I finally had to &quot;come out&quot; at my group although I knew a long time<br/>
before doing so. Most of them are relaxed/eclectic, but still use curriculum<br/>
materials, some are charter, and most have &quot;educational goals&quot; for their<br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
There is definitely an aura that they feel slightly superior and view my<br/>
unschooling being not so much dangerous neglect, but a crackpot experiment<br/>
that will undoubtedly fade away once Jayn gets older and starts to need more<br/>
teaching. I have no fear of this occurring myself! <br/>
<br/>
Most are rigidly controlling of food, tv, computers and how their time is to<br/>
be spent. They are also wonderfully gentle, non-spanking parents who allow<br/>
their children the opportunity to develop their own games and relationships<br/>
at the park without the constant mediation and bossiness that characterizes<br/>
the &quot;ordinary&quot; parents we see at parks. <br/>
<br/>
So many of these hs&#39;ers I know are &quot;following a program&quot; even for their<br/>
little children, recommending the &quot;early reading&quot; and &quot;reading readiness&quot;<br/>
materials. They look for resources for &quot;early immersion Spanish&quot; or take<br/>
classes, seek out teachable moments, or insist that their children must do a<br/>
certain amount of various subjects before playing. I hear the conversations<br/>
although I don&#39;t usually participate in them. The parents strive to make it<br/>
&quot;more interesting&quot; and sometimes even use (gasp!) videos as part of some<br/>
unit studies. These are 3 and 4 and 5 year olds. <br/>
<br/>
They talk about how they did &quot;The Food Pyramid&quot; (as if there were only one)<br/>
so that they could explain why their parental food controls were right. They<br/>
genuinely delight in how much fun the kids had cutting out little pictures<br/>
of fruit etc and sticking them on some chart they downloaded. (Jayn has not<br/>
shown the slightest interest in this type of activity so far - she likes to<br/>
cut out paper dolls, snowflakes or geometric shapes for use in collages.) <br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of talk about how much enjoyment their child gets from the<br/>
whatever Unit they are doing, and how &quot;We have to stop or she&#39;d want to<br/>
learn ALL the State capitols in ONE DAY!&quot; I always say, &quot;So, why stop?&quot; The<br/>
answers are always either along the lines of some other commitment coming up<br/>
in the next half hour, or parental exhaustion. There is always a sense of<br/>
envy (not from me!) for those parents whose children love to do workbooks<br/>
from the &quot;unlucky&quot; ones whose children resist the things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only ever had one (new to our group) parent actually say, &quot;But you&#39;ll<br/>
use a Curriculum *later* won&#39;t you - when you *need* one?&quot; Answer (with<br/>
hidden evil grin): &quot;No - I&#39;m a Radical Unschooler. I can&#39;t see us ever using<br/>
a curriculum.&quot; &quot;Oh&quot;. Then parent literally, and I mean literally, turned and<br/>
strode briskly away, to another little knot of parents, and hasn&#39;t spoken to<br/>
me since. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the children go, when the homeschoolers are all playing together<br/>
at the park, it is impossible to tell which ones use Abeka or Sonlight or<br/>
whatever (names I have heard but know nothing about) from the Unit studiers<br/>
or Jayn. It is only when they start to interact with their own parents that<br/>
differences in parenting become discernible. There are quite a few parents<br/>
who are ready to jump in with &quot;Did you say Thank you for that cracker?&quot;.<br/>
There are sometimes: &quot;Can we go to Sophia&#39;s tomorrow?&quot; &quot;We have to finish<br/>
our school work first&quot;; and the occasional inexplicable &quot;May I take off my<br/>
sweater?&quot; &quot;No&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It is those moments that remind me with a jolt that I am an Unschooler with<br/>
a whole different mind set. Thank goodness!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have to call myself an Unschooler, and have done for a while, as I am<br/>
surrounded by people who are most emphatically not unschoolers in my hs<br/>
group. I finally had to &quot;come out&quot; at my group although I knew a long time<br/>
before doing so. Most of them are relaxed/eclectic, but still use curriculum<br/>
materials, some are charter, and most have &quot;educational goals&quot; for their<br/>
children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See, now that makes sense in that context.  And the eastern corridor thing <br/>
has been discussed here (greater &quot;here&quot;) for years, that in Delaware kids are <br/>
registered for pre-schools (or they apply and are on waiting lists) sometimes <br/>
before birth!  So an explanation for why one is NOT getting into Madame Poof&#39;s <br/>
Prep is WAY more real and necessary than someone in New Mexico or Texas or <br/>
Colorado having kids in the mini-van all the time.  Nobody asks diddly out here.<br/>

A neighboring family used to homeschool and this year the older two were in <br/>
school.  Holly visits with them in the summer, after a city free-lunch program <br/>
at the park between our houses.   A few times last winter, I asked whether she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go visit, and she would shrug and say no, because the kids <br/>
(she names them but I don&#39;t know all the names) were in school.  There are two <br/>
more preschool ages, a baby and a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly told me that the mom had told her that those two don&#39;t play <br/>
together at all anymore.  She didn&#39;t say it in a particularly sad way, I don&#39;t <br/>
think.  Just informational.  Holly thought that was awful, and it&#39;s a story <br/>
she&#39;ll be telling in Las Vegas next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to say here that I was speaking in Las Vegas (with Holly).  I&#39;ll put <br/>
that in another post.<br/>

<br/>
So if someone said, &quot;We were always relaxed about educational issues when<br/>
the kids were young. Looking back, I suppose we were already unschooling,<br/>
even though we didn&#39;t have a name for it....&quot;  that wouldn&#39;t be an<br/>
exaggeration.  But it is hindesight coloring the past.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are just talking about being precise.  Our infant will have<br/>
always been unschooled (hopefully things will only improve) but our oldest<br/>
won&#39;t have been.<br/>
