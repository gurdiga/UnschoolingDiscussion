&gt; Yay! that&#39;s just what I&#39;m looking for!<br/>
&gt; And having been on this list now for less than 24 hours (wow, there&#39;s a lot <br/>

This has been a post-filled week. It&#39;s not usually quite THIS busy! The <br/>
spanking/respect issues (among others) get folks fired up! Expect less than <br/>
half on a normal day! &lt;g&gt; Although we CAN go a few hours of relative <br/>
inaction, it&#39;s fairly lively.<br/>
