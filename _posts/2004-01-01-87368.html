<div id="ygrps-yiv-925793570">One dastardly idea -- she might learn what NOT to do. :) <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, sometimes the other person has to go through something -- even if <br/>
we don&#39;t -- in order to end up where they need to be. Maybe in the end it will <br/>
affirm her commitment to hsing. <br/>
<br/>
And, otoh, one article I read recently was about teachers leaving the <br/>
profession partly because ps is not at all like what they are taught in college -- so <br/>
maybe this Mom could keep some of the good ideas that are taught and not have <br/>
to try to apply them in a ps setting -- and get some personal benefit that a <br/>
teacher proceeding to ps would not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she wants the degree for future employment purposes too -- life not <br/>
always being so predictable.<br/>

All of which still begs the question: Why would anyone decide to pursue a <br/>
masters in education BECAUSE they&#39;ve decided to homeschool, and why would <br/>
they <br/>
think it was a good idea to pursue that while the child was very young, and <br/>
why <br/>
oh why would any homeschoolers encourage them in that pursuit?<br/>
<br/>
Again, how would pursuing that masters help a young mother in her goal of <br/>
homeschooling her very very young child?<br/>
