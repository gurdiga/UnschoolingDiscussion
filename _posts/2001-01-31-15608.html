<div id="ygrps-yiv-812289434"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Many people who embrace a pro-life view are in favor of and practice<br/>
&gt; birth control, usually those methods which prevent fertilization rather<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; implantation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many but not most.<br/>
&gt; There are a badillion Catholics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I have great respect for your views in general and for all the<br/>
informative posts you have made on this list. I have to say I am surprised<br/>
and dismayed by the close-minded words I have seen you type on this thread.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I&#39;m a non-fundamentalist pro-life person who (as many other<br/>
people who don&#39;t believe in routine abortion) practice responsible birth<br/>
control and do not proselytize my beliefs to others nor condemn other people<br/>
for their choices. Let&#39;s not see the world in black-and-white. There are all<br/>
kinds of people who hold pro-choice beliefs, from those who work to help<br/>
children born to parents who don&#39;t want or care for them all the way to the<br/>
NARAL head worker I know who uses abortion as birth control (has had 5 so<br/>
far). Obviously it would not be fair if I used my co-worker the casual<br/>
abortion-getter who talks about her former babies as &quot;the little blobs&quot; to<br/>
be got rid of, to represent all people who are pro-choice. There are all<br/>
kinds of people who are pro-life, from abortion-clinic bombers and<br/>
in-your-face proselytizers to quiet people who live their lives in<br/>
accordance with their own beliefs and feel strongly in their hearts that<br/>
killing children (even unborn) is wrong but who do not condemn others for<br/>
the choices they make or beliefs they hold. Obviously it would not be fair<br/>
to use the abortion-clinic bomber to represent all people who are pro-life.<br/>
Even among Catholics, there is a huge spectrum in beliefs and practices. Any<br/>
time we lump all people who hold a particular belief under one single<br/>
banner, we cheat ourselves of recognizing the diversity of human belief, and<br/>
of learning something about the way other people think and feel. We also<br/>
hurt feelings and impair the ability to communicate honestly and openly. I&#39;d<br/>
hope that on this list we can do better than that.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Are you a practicing Catholic or Southern Baptist?  If you are not, then <br/>
you really need to state that these are your opinions.   For years I <br/>
curiously watched the Catholic church, studied and became an adult convert. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to drag this out, I&#39;m sorry; I just now saw this one.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up Southern Baptist and didn&#39;t just go to church, but was heavily <br/>
involved in all possible training union, girls&#39; auxiliary, etc., and used my <br/>
own allowance to buy  materials to study more (What Baptists&#39; Believe, in <br/>
hardback, with my own kid money, etc.) because I had planned to be a <br/>
missionary.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, up the road, I was for year and some involved in the folk mass at <br/>
Santa Cruz church in Santa Cruz, New Mexico (kind of a suburb of Espanola, <br/>
which is North of Santa Fe) because friends of mine weren&#39;t able to put on as <br/>
good a folk mass as they wanted to so they solicited my help.  Because of <br/>
criticism by some of the parents (&quot;She&#39;s not even Catholic!&quot;) and because of <br/>
my intense interest in religion, and the feeling that if I was going to claim <br/>
to teach I should know MORE than just what my own church taught, I started <br/>
attending CYO classes at night with the Catholic kids my age.  Few of them <br/>
were really paying attention or asking pertinent questions.  Certainly they <br/>
weren&#39;t doing the reading.  I did.<br/>
<br/>
I traded Bibles with my best friend, but she showed up about an hour later <br/>
because her mom had freaked out that she had a protestant Bible in the house <br/>
and needed their Catholic Bible back RIGHT THEN.<br/>
<br/>
From being one of the two coordinators of the music for folk mass, I ended up <br/>
hanging out with one of the priests a fair amount.   We went to do the folk <br/>
music at other little churches up in the boonies.  He&#39;d answer my questions, <br/>
too.  And I have always read about the beliefs of other people.  Several of <br/>
the books I bought when my kids were younger and that we&#39;ve read and used <br/>
several times as reference are about different religions, which grew from <br/>
what, and what their main beliefs are.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are you a practicing Catholic or Southern Baptist?  If you are not, then <br/>
you really need to state that these are your opinions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I were a practicing Catholic it would either be my opinion (if it were my <br/>
opinion) or truth (if I were stating the official position of the church).  <br/>
If I were a practicing Baptist and said &quot;It&#39;s okay for Baptists to drink and <br/>
dance&quot; that would NOT be my opinion, that would be a falsehood.  It is okay <br/>
for an individual Baptist to ignore the beliefs of the church he&#39;s been <br/>
baptized into, has joined of his own free will.  It is okay (with me, and <br/>
with some who post here) for a Roman Catholic mass-attending person to say &quot;I <br/>
am Catholic&quot; but to ignore the dictates of the Pope.  It&#39;s not okay with the <br/>
Pope, and it&#39;s not (by that line of reasoning) okay with God.  IF the Pope <br/>
doesn&#39;t speak for God, then why would someone say &quot;I am Roman Catholic&quot;?  You <br/>
cannot have your cake and eat it and have it ascend into heaven all at the <br/>
same time. (Unless YOU eat it and YOU ascend into heaven, which could surely <br/>
happen again if it has ever happened.)<br/>
<br/>
I live in New Mexico.  I know nothing of the state budget these days.  If I <br/>
pretended I did, I would just be bluffing.  I don&#39;t bluff.  If someone here <br/>
who lives in New Jersey or Oregon but just happens to know or care about the <br/>
state budget of New Mexico, has read up on it because of personal curiosity <br/>
or because their job or volunteer work caused them to need to know, THEY <br/>
would be way more qualified to speak about that than I am even though I live <br/>
in New Mexico and pay taxes here.<br/>
<br/>
Being Baptist or Catholic doesn&#39;t make a person a spokesman for the <br/>
leadership of that religion.<br/>

Where in New Mexico? We lived in Cordova and Santa Fe from 1995-1998.<br/>
<br/>
Also I want to share that I&#39;ve realized that I had learned a lot from the <br/>
raising dogs & pro-life thread. Throughout the discussions and arguments I <br/>
was watching people express strong opinions, react to each other, make <br/>
assumptions. and attack without asking questions. This morning I saw that <br/>
that&#39;s a lot of what happens between me and my husband. I don&#39;t get triggered <br/>
by this list the way I do by him:&gt;) We have all the big stuff (religion, <br/>
educational & political beliefs, etc.) in common but have very different <br/>
personalities. I felt like we communicated better today about our <br/>
difficulties and that was a direct result of reading all those e-mails. I&#39;m <br/>
glad I didn&#39;t delete them. So I guess it was all &quot;on topic&quot; after all. I&#39;d <br/>
still like to see us all work on clear communication and questioning rather <br/>
than assuming and I pledge to work on that more here at home as well. I feel <br/>
so much less isolated in my daily life at home now that I have this group. So <br/>
thanks! -Amalia-</div>

church.  If you don&#39;t want to follow the Pope, you become a protestant, or <br/>
you become a sinner.   If you go against what your church teaches, you&#39;re <br/>
plain going against those teachings.  If you think your personal relation <br/>
with God takes precedence over what the priests, bishops, archbishops, <br/>
cardinals and the Pope say, welcome to Protestantism!</div>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I live in New Mexico. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Where in New Mexico? We lived in Cordova and Santa Fe from 1995-1998. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque now, but grew up in Espanola, and I know my way around Cordova <br/>
(used to, anyway, in the 1960&#39;s and early 1970&#39;s).   When I was teaching Jr. <br/>
High I had two girls in my class, in the same period, both named Sandra J. <br/>
Cordova, both from Cordova.  (For the benefit of readers here, Cordova has a <br/>
few hundred people.  It&#39;s between Chimayo and Truchas, for map mavens who <br/>
might want to look it up.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also I want to share that I&#39;ve realized that I had learned a lot from the <br/>
raising dogs & pro-life thread. Throughout the discussions and arguments I <br/>
was watching people express strong opinions, react to each other, make <br/>
assumptions. and attack without asking questions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always disturbed by being accused of attacking when I&#39;m just clarifying <br/>
something which was unclearly stated, and then I&#39;m attacked (by name, and <br/>
directly) if I defend that.  It happens.  I should learn not to be surprised.<br/>

Dear Sandra,<br/>
I wasn&#39;t referring to you when I mentioned attacks, &quot;express strong opinions&quot; <br/>
was referring more to your e-mails. That&#39;s my husband&#39;s style. I&#39;m more of a <br/>
react and attack type in the relationship. Peace, Amalia</div>

This reminds me of the time when I pounded my fist on a table during a <br/>
meeting and was accused of &quot;violence.&quot; This was in the Baltimore group where <br/>
I first found out that homeschooling did not necessarily mean unschooling:&gt;) <br/>
