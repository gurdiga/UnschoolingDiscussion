&lt;&lt; I was under the impression that the moderators <br/>
were frowning upon the concept of pulling an old post out of context <br/>
like you did here.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something from yesterday is not &quot;old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it wasn&#39;t out of context.  The pertinent line was offered, immediately <br/>
followed by the full paragraph.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day Holly said that although people will sometimes address her as <br/>
&quot;young lady,&quot; nobody ever addresses anyone as &quot;old woman,&quot; but I told her <br/>
they do in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Here is that passage, NOT out of <br/>
context, and the rest can be viewed at <br/>

and various other internet sites.<br/>
<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
Old woman!<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
Man!<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
Man. Sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
I&#39;m thirty-seven.<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
I-- what?<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
I&#39;m thirty-seven. I&#39;m not old.<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
Well, I can&#39;t just call you &#39;Man&#39;.<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
Well, you could say &#39;Dennis&#39;.<br/>
ARTHUR:<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t know you were called &#39;Dennis&#39;.<br/>
DENNIS:<br/>
Well, you didn&#39;t bother to find out, did you?<br/>
<br/>
That discussion led to my buying the new special edition DVD.  It&#39;s a marvel. <br/>
 Any of you with any interest in that should just buy it, do not pass go, <br/>
don&#39;t bother to rent it.  It has HOURS of special features and extras.  Days <br/>
of fun.  <br/>
<br/>
This afternoon I was sewing and listening to the voiceover commentary by John <br/>
Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin.  (There&#39;s another whole voiceover by <br/>
Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, who were the directors.)   There are two <br/>
scenes in Japanese, with subtitles of the Japanese translated back into <br/>
English.   There&#39;s more than I can tell here, on two disks, but anyway, I was <br/>
impressed by how intellectual the whole discussion was in some places.   <br/>
Sometimes what seems unimportant or silly is really the weighty core of an <br/>
entire discussion or piece of art or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Context&quot; itself means with the surrounding information, either literal <br/>
(writing) or conversational, visual, social or emotional.  It&#39;s like &quot;in <br/>
situ,&quot; for archeologists.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an important concept for kids to understand, as unschoolers are learning <br/>
in context and not separate from life.  Watching this Holy Grail DVD, it&#39;s <br/>
cool to see commentary in context (in the presence of the movie being played) <br/>
by people who are describing what happened in context (remembering back to <br/>
the time of the filming and discussing the political, financial, artistic and <br/>
social realities of the early 1970&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I wrote that I was thinking of the &quot;I&#39;m NOT a witch&quot; rhythm and delivery.<br/>
<br/>
BEDEVERE:<br/>
How do you know she is a witch?<br/>
VILLAGER #2:<br/>
She looks like one.<br/>
CROWD:<br/>
Right! Yeah! Yeah!<br/>
BEDEVERE:<br/>
Bring her forward.<br/>
WITCH:<br/>
I&#39;m not a witch. I&#39;m not a witch.<br/>
BEDEVERE:<br/>
Uh, but you are dressed as one.<br/>
WITCH:<br/>
They dressed me up like this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about witches at all, but about logic.  There are few better logic <br/>
lessons I&#39;ve ever seen than absurdity, and combining absurdity with medieval <br/>
thinking is glory!<br/>
