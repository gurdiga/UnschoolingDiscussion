<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828811825"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes, Richland is one of the Tri-Cities, <br/>
&gt;Mary Ellen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary Ellen already knows this, but we just moved from Richland last year to<br/>
Idaho for DH&#39;s work.  Smaller town, but nice.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents, brother and his family, and aunt and uncle, as well as my DH<br/>
parents live in the tri cities still.  Kind of funny because I just moved<br/>
there about 5 years ago (from Oregon) when my parents moved there (from New<br/>
Mexico) for work and offered to help me with a place to live so I could go<br/>
back to school (ick!  Long story)  Then my brother moved back in with them<br/>
after he got out of the navy (in San Diego) and met his wife up there.  My<br/>
Uncle got a job in the area therough my parent&#39;s contacts and so my aunt<br/>
and Uncle moved up there from Georgia.  So now they live there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a smaaaaaal, smaaaaaal world<br/>

I cut a photo out of our newspaper of a dad pushing a stroller with a<br/>
toddler and a baby, last name of Kuykendall.  Any relation, or is it a<br/>
common last name? :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941913335">I lived most of my life in Tacoma area, Western Oregon, and Alaska.  Now<br/>
that I&#39;ve been in Eastern WA for awhile, I find that I can&#39;t see anything<br/>
on the west side because all those trees are in the way!<br/>
On a clear day, we can see the Blue Mountains from here.<br/>
I have found, though, that every place I&#39;ve been has had its own beauty! <br/>
(And it is hard to beat Puget Sound - or the Greater Seattle Metropolis<br/>
as I like to call it - on a sunny day!)<br/>

PS It takes us four hours to drive from here to Tacoma and that includes<br/>
a couple of brief rest stops.  It&#39;s about 3 1/2 to Seattle.  If you ever<br/>
get here, let me know.  Maybe you could join our hs group at a park day<br/>
or something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like my husband and sons a year age.  LOL  But we did not get any<br/>
pictures in the paper that we are aware of.  Check your phone books, it&#39;s a<br/>
fairly common last name.  I run into folks who have all sorts of<br/>
pronunciations, but the same spelling.  Kook-end-all, Kie-ken-doll, even<br/>
Kooey-ken-dall.  My husbands family has maintained the traditional<br/>
German-Dutch pronunciation, Kirk-end-all.  I tell people we have an<br/>
invisible &quot;R&quot;  sort of like a silent letter.  LOL<br/>

Just in case the photo is my family and we didn&#39;t know it, when and where<br/>

area, especially on the islands.  We were married in Friday Harbor, on San<br/>
Juan Island, and we just love that area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165909424">The children are named Brittany and Isaiah.  Dad is Curtis.  Only<br/>
Brittany and the dad&#39;s legs are showing.  From a month or so ago.<br/>

My maiden name was Kacmarcik.  It is a Slovak name and there are many<br/>
variations of it as well.  One of my uncles had it changed to &quot;Karick&quot;. <br/>
When I was a kid, I sometimes got the nickname of Mary Onion Ketchup.<br/>
