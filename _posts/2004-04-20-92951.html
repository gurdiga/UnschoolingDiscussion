<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985728783">Well, I didn&#39;t find the comic to which the original poster was <br/>
referring to, but I did learn who Hathor was...very cool.<br/>
Here&#39;s a site that explains this Egyptian Goddess:<br/>

And I found this at a different site, but I thought the description <br/>
of her home and recreational activities was awesome:<br/>
<br/>
Hathor<br/>
The Great Celestial Cow Goddess of ancient Egypt. She was creator of <br/>
the world and all it contains. The protectress of women, she is the <br/>
goddess of love and joy, the mistress of merriment. She is the <br/>
sovereign of music and dance and the weaving of garlands. She often <br/>
places Her spirit in the sistrum, a sacred rattle which drove away <br/>
evil spirits. Her temple was the home of intoxication and place of <br/>
enjoyment. She nourishes the living with Her milk and welcomes the <br/>
dead into the next world. She was worshipped in 11th century B.C. <br/>
Israel; sometimes depicted with a lion head, as the Sphinx. The <br/>
lotus was her flower.<br/>
Hathor, the goddess of Creation and Nourishment of Life, was <br/>
worshipped as a major deity in Egypt for over 3000 years. After she <br/>
gave birth to the solar globe in her form as a Cow Goddess, she held <br/>
it between her horns while swimming through the cosmic ocean. <br/>
