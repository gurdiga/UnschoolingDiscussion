conference tomorrow.  We have attended several of them and enjoyed them.<br/>

for a camp that week, so we can&#39;t come to that either. Well, maybe *I* <br/>
could... but probably not :-(<br/>

*lol*  Well, I&#39;m already registered for that one, too, Kelly, so it&#39;s a<br/>
possibility. C&#39;mon Marti!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went last year and found it very frustrating.   <br/>
It was a conference for newbies.  I have been unschooling for a long <br/>
time.  The only thing that slightly interested me was a workshop on <br/>
multiple intelligences.  I almost walked out on the keynote <br/>
speaker.  The woman who wrote &quot;The Well Trained Mind&quot;.  She <br/>
literally repulsed me with the things she had to say about children <br/>
and learning.  She kept referring to her biracial adopted child <br/>
as &quot;my biracial adopted daughter&quot; (over and over.  She had to <br/>
separate her from her other children, because she didn&#39;t thrive <br/>
quite as well with her methods.  Obviously being biracial and <br/>
adopted had everything to do with it.  :-P<br/>
After going to the live and learn conference, I would never waste my <br/>
time or money on a &quot;regular&quot; conference again.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I didn&#39;t go last year because of the keynote speaker. This year, I&#39;m<br/>
interested in hearing what Daniel Pink has to say, and the conference is<br/>
pretty much in my backyard, so.... Plus, I&#39;ve never been, so it seemed like<br/>
a good time to go.<br/>
<br/>
All my unschooling friends here who go say they pretty much just hang out in<br/>
the unschooler&#39;s lounge and chat. I&#39;m all for hanging out and chatting! *g*<br/>
