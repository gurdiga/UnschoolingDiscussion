&lt;&lt; As a matter a fact our state list has a good 200-300 people  and <br/>
when I post I get attacked for my thoughts by a select few and NO one else  <br/>
speaks unless that are attacking me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds familiar!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the listowner of the biggest inclusive list in New Mexico (which is <br/>
smaller than 200 people), and I avoid talking about unschooling there because too <br/>
many people squawk and swoon.<br/>
