<div id="ygrps-yiv-208279585">&lt;&lt;what&#39;s ezzo and babywise?  bridget&gt;&gt;<br/>
hi bridget,<br/>
hate to go into it here (just bc it can turn into a long tiresome topic!), <br/>
however you deserve an answer to your query :) --<br/>
it is a &quot;child-training&quot; program that is also called &quot;growing kids god&#39;s way&quot; <br/>
that claims to have the relief that we on-demand nursing mothers need by <br/>
applying strict scheduling of nursing/waking/playing, etc with the be-all and <br/>
end-all of sleeping thru the night at a very early age.  it was strange to <br/>
hear it from the moore&#39;s because in my mind, listening to our children and <br/>
responding to their needs is what they are advocating for homeschooling <br/>
style, yet for babies it is keep them in line before they control you....  <br/>
the other funny part is that they claim jesus was homeschooled (therefore it <br/>
is an excellent thing to do,) yet dont carry that thinking along the same <br/>
parallel for caring for babies....<br/>
