<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223910057">I dropped Anna and JP off to see Holes again today.  I had a meeting at <br/>
school, ( my school) for a final project and they didnt want to go.  Anyway, <br/>
on the way home, Anna said.. &quot;Madame Zeroni is the same voice as Yzma on The <br/>
Emperors New Groove&quot;  I said, &quot;really, are you sure?&quot;  She said..&quot;yeah, I <br/>
think so, I figured it out, they sound just alike&quot;  We came home and put in <br/>
ENG and then looked up the credits for both movies.. She was right, it&#39;s <br/>
Eartha Kitt in both movies.    <br/>
