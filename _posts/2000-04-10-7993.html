<div id="ygrps-yiv-386517456">Hey Kim,<br/>
My mum and yours must have been sisters! UI heard all the same stuff when I<br/>
was growing up not forgetting &quot;Make sure you have clean undies on in case<br/>
you are hit by a car&quot; Apparently that is standard triage procedure - Check<br/>
her blood pressure, vital stats and undies....these don&#39;t look fresh on<br/>
today Dr...Hmmm, well she will have to wait in the corridor then while I<br/>
tend to these deserving patients!!!&quot;<br/>

i guess that would make sense.  i told my dh about your mother&#39;s &#39;advise&#39; and<br/>
he roared.  thanks for the laugh - it&#39;s good to laugh about one&#39;s upbringing.<br/>
my mom gives advise that is really off the wall and i just say &#39;umm<br/>
interesting&#39; but we do live a good 3 day drive away:)<br/>
