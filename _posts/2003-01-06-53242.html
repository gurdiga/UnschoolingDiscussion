Could you possibly put paragraph breaks in your longer posts?  It makes them much easier to read. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL.. sure, Teresa, I will try.. I confess, I am a terrible at &quot;shortening&quot; <br/>
any writing I do.  My most feared assignment in school was to write a  SHORT <br/>
STORY.. ( shriek.!)   I try to put breaks in when I  change topics, but I <br/>
know I am guilty of just running on and on.   I promise to make a <br/>
consciencous effort the next long post I write<br/>
