(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom/).<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t figure out how to ask Yahoo to send out an intro letter. It just<br/>
does it automatically when someone joins. But here&#39;s the text:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>
they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>
is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>
curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>
when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>
Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>
find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>
learning, come join us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions<br/>
about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
(fetteroll@...)<br/>
