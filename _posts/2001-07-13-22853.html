&lt;&lt; The kinds of socialization that Zak has learned that other kids do <br/>
 and thereby copies most of it have been:<br/>
 <br/>
 teasing over cherished toys brought to school (such as his baby)<br/>
 being called pinhead or butthead<br/>
 being hit or kick by aggressive children<br/>
 spitting<br/>
 shouting and screaming when he doesn&#39;t get his own way at home.<br/>
 <br/>
 Needless to say he&#39;s coming out of there today!!!!!  It&#39;s also been <br/>
 costing us $500 a month to send him to this great place of <br/>
 socialization.  I know that Zak loves to be with other kids, but I <br/>
 don&#39;t think these are the kids he needs to be with.  He doesn&#39;t like <br/>
 the teasing and we have talked and talked to the teachers.  Basically <br/>
 their attitude is &quot;all kids have to go through this&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s part of <br/>
 life&quot;.... My life does not include anyone who displays the above <br/>
 behavior... None of my friends spit at me or tease me, so how is this <br/>
 a part of life?<br/>
 <br/>
 I guess we realized that we are very concerned about our son&#39;s <br/>
 socialization and healthy socialization is what we are looking for.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Dawn, BTDT just this summer. Zoe quit camp on her own on Monday. I kept <br/>
telling dh I wasn&#39;t real thrilled w/ what was coming home. <br/>
Teasing,taunting,treating us like 5 yr olds basically. Zoe is very reserved <br/>
so she watched everything then brought it home to try it out. We eventually <br/>
resorted to threats about the pool but soon gave that up b/c as we all know <br/>
this doesn&#39;t work. the kid behaves to get what they want not b/c they respect <br/>
you any more than before.<br/>
<br/>
   Also dh witnessed unattentive counselors and this sold him on quitting.<br/>
<br/>
   I agree socialization is really out in the world and it works better. i <br/>
plan to try and find others to get together w/ and we can supervise <br/>
behaviors. Also we may try the private school camp. I watched these children <br/>
at the library one day and there was no back biting and stealing and <br/>
such.Adults are the counselors there.<br/>
<br/>
   i do blame myself alot b/c I signed her up for this camp b/c it started <br/>
earlier and I needed the time to train for a goal. Selfish I know but she <br/>
also was dieing to play w/ others then again when ever I picked her up she <br/>
was playing alone. Most of the kids new eachother from daycare and preschool. <br/>
At 5 they tend to stick together and like only one other playpal. 3 is <br/>
definitely a crowd at this age.<br/>
<br/>
   Oh and while I was away dh took her to a friends house to play w/ her 2 <br/>
younger brothers 4 and 6 and he said they had an absolute blast and never got <br/>
nasty or rude. Unfortunately these boys live here and in another state so it <br/>
is sporadic.:o(<br/>
<br/>
   OK enough of my 2 cents. :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have 5 kids, 4 which are school age.  My girls complain here and <br/>
 there about not being around a bunch of kids like they use to when <br/>
 they where in school.  But I think they romanticize about it.  I <br/>
 remember them always complaining about someone&#39;s behavior when they <br/>
 got home and I was soooo sick of it. I have always taught our kids to <br/>
 be respectful to others.  I know they are not perfect, but from what <br/>
 I see from some other kids (not all schooled kids) they are pretty <br/>
 darn nice.  <br/>

experience. Any tips. She doesn&#39;t care some days. Then I get pissed <br/>
eventually and start threatening to take away pool priveledges. Which seems <br/>
ridiculous to me since it isn&#39;t related,not a natural consequence. But I get <br/>
caught up. I have told her when she speaks disrespectfully to me I will not <br/>
listen and I will not do things for her.  <br/>
<br/>
  EX: Get me some juice! I then go about my business and ignore the nasty <br/>
request.She then will change her tune and I gladly get the juice. I guess <br/>
maybe time will heal this. Hopefully b/c rude behaviors like this are <br/>
hotbuttons for me. As a child I was flicked in the mouth for such talk.<br/>

She&#39;ll need time to recover from the stresses of camp.  Even things that seem <br/>
up and good can be big stressors.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of ignoring her you could ask her compassionately and <br/>
sympathetically things like &quot;At camp did people just tell you to do things <br/>
without saying please?&quot;  and if she says &quot;yes&quot; then you could say &quot;I&#39;m really <br/>
sorry they were that way&quot; and hug her.<br/>
<br/>
Tone of voice is everything on those things.  You have to really think for <br/>
that moment not &quot;She&#39;s being rude to ME&quot; but rather &quot;someone has been rude to <br/>
her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If as a child you were flicked for that, remember your own little self and do <br/>
what you wish your mom had done instead of  hurting you, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
who has had all those things happen except the flicking; I was called names <br/>
instead<br/>
