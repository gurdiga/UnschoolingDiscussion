<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405154486">I was wondering if everyone brought their children to the SOS Conference. I have 3 children ages 8,5,4.<br/>
For financial reasons it would seem easier for me and my husband to come alone - however - I was also wondering if there were other children, particulary unschooled children attending, if it would be good for my kids to go. <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted my husband and myself to be able to really listen to the speakers - most of the time I would be chasing children - which isn&#39;t so bad - But does hinder the ability to fully listen. <br/>

Any suggetsions on what others have done  - or are planning to do would be great!<br/>

and hung out on the terrace! &lt;G&gt; They didn&#39;t TELL their husbands OR their <br/>
children that they were invited! &lt;G&gt; Both kids and husbands were pissed when <br/>
they found out AFTER the fact! &lt;G&gt; Anyway, they may be out of luck this year, <br/>
I hear the husbands and kids are demanding to come this year! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand! I&#39;ve tried to help families out with the early bird family <br/>
rate---paid before June 1. But there will be a lot for kids to do. It was <br/>
also good for the dads (who generally are a little harder to convince) to see <br/>
so many unschooled kids in one place! The kids could make a few new <br/>
unschooled friends---but it really depends on your financial situation!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand that too! There will be a &quot;toddler room&quot; attached to the main <br/>
speakers&#39; room so the littluns can be &quot;contained&quot;. The older children would <br/>
be right next door in another ballroom with lots of fun things to do all day. <br/>
Again--up to you!<br/>

&gt; Ren had her crew last year. She may be coming alone. Why don&#39;t you email her <br/>
&gt; and ask a &quot;non-biased&quot; person! &lt;G&gt; I want you ALL here! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a>   she&#39;ll be happy to talk.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have all the funshops for the kids listed yet---because I don&#39;t have <br/>
the contracts in yet---no confirmation, and I want to be sure who&#39;ll be <br/>
there. But there should be lots of funnthings to keep them occupied!<br/>
<br/>
Talk with Ren---or post on the boards or the e-list for others&#39; opinions! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look forward to meeting you ALL! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742979009">The Live and Learn conference, in my opinion, is a GREAT place for kids!<br/>
<br/>
For me, one of the major attractions of last year&#39;s conference was the <br/>
knowledge that my son would get to see other functioning unschooling <br/>
families.  There aren&#39;t too many unschoolers in our community (well, that&#39;s <br/>
a gross understatement; aside from ONE other family we only recently met, <br/>
there are NO unschoolers that I know of!).  Although my son is completely <br/>
dedicated to unschooling, he is surrounded by either school-at-homers or <br/>
kids who go to school full time. Either way, most of his friends are <br/>
conventionally parented with food and other restrictions as well as <br/>
punishments and time-outs and all the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Among the many, many reasons the conference was so cool, one thing that <br/>
sticks out clearly for me was that my son got to be around kids and their <br/>
parents whose experiences were similar to ours.  It was great for both of <br/>
us to be around kids who were being parented with compassion and <br/>
respect.  It was great to see older kids who had been unschooled and were <br/>
bright and interested and interesting.  Of course, that was no surprise for <br/>
me, but it was still good for me to see with my own eyeballs, and I know it <br/>
was good for Liam, too.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding the ability to sit out on a patio drinking wine and talking <br/>
with no concerns of kids, I wouldn&#39;t dream of going there without my son <br/>
because it was such an affirming situation for him as an unschooler.  Other <br/>
than the wonderful real life he is living (which, of course, cannot be <br/>
discounted), he doesn&#39;t get that many of them.<br/>
<br/>
I say, bring the kids!<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Pam L., it&#39;s a 13-hour drive for us, coming from New York <br/>
State.  Even though it was maybe 2 hours longer than we had patience for, <br/>
the drive together was a lot of fun and we really loved it!!  Hopefully, it <br/>
won&#39;t rain the whole time we&#39;re driving (like it did last time) and we can <br/>
have even more adventures!<br/>

<br/>
Although we have been unschooling for a few years now, ill-health has<br/>
prevented me from finding out more about the unschooling organizations,<br/>
conferences, periodicals, etc.  I am very interested in this conference, as<br/>
well as anything else out there that is going on.  I would love to interact<br/>
more now with other unschoolers!  Is there a web-site out there with some<br/>
collective information along these lines, or are there any other conferences<br/>
that anyone is aware of?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Annette</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I brought mine and there were a lot of children there of all ages.  Mine were <br/>
5 and 8 at the time.  They loved it and really felt like they fit in.  They <br/>
had no trouble making friends right away because everyone was like them.  <br/>
There were so many things for them to do.  They cried when we had to leave.  <br/>
And the atmosphere was so relaxed that it made it easy to bring children.  <br/>
Not like most conferences of the &quot;schooly&quot; type.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448839993">I am considering making this a family vacation as well.  How do families <br/>
with youngsters handle attending the speaking engagements?  Does Dad stay <br/>
with them while mom goes, or vice versa, or do they attend right along with <br/>
the parents?<br/>
<br/>
We have 7 kids and I&#39;m nervous as to how &#39;young family&#39; friendly this will <br/>
be.  Can someone shed some light??<br/>

<br/>
YEAH!!!!<br/>
<br/>
How cool will that be???  You&#39;d better be sure to get your &quot;arse&quot; back here <br/>
in time, okay!  You just might want to stay there!! (And, I certainly <br/>
wouldn&#39;t blame you!)  I&#39;m sad enough just to know that you&#39;re going no <br/>
mail!  But, of course, you&#39;ll probably write in every now and again while <br/>
you&#39;re across the big puddle, right?<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip.  Now I have something ELSE to look forward to!  By the <br/>
way, if you&#39;re back by the end of June (the 27th, 28th & 29th, to be <br/>
exact), I&#39;ll be performing with my group GaiaWolf at the Animal Rights 2003 <br/>
conference, which is being held at the McLean Hilton.  Here&#39;s a link for <br/>
anyone so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the invite, Shyrley! If you are back, we will definitely take <br/>
you up on it!<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re from Ontario and we&#39;ve done the drive to Florida a few times with the kids.  They say one of their favourite things about those vacations is being carried out to the car in the middle of the night (we usually leave around 3-4am) and being bundled in with pillows and blankets!!  LOL  They also enjoy spending a day or two in the van since we deck it out to travel: TV/VCR (I usually pick up or tape a new movie to surprise them), video games etc. and they each pack a knapsack of toys, small games, and paper/pencils to keep them happily busy. In fact, whenever I tell my youngest we&#39;re going on vacation he always asks if we&#39;re leaving in the middle of the night and if we&#39;re not he&#39;s very disappointed!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Do you want to stop here on your way down? We&#39;re not far off I-95 in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Northern Virginia and will be leaving for the conferenece ourselves on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thursday morning. SC is 500 miles from here.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Shyrley<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wait, let me think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; YEAH!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How cool will that be???  You&#39;d better be sure to get your &quot;arse&quot; back here<br/>
&gt; in time, okay!  You just might want to stay there!! (And, I certainly<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t blame you!)  I&#39;m sad enough just to know that you&#39;re going no<br/>
&gt; mail!  But, of course, you&#39;ll probably write in every now and again while<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re across the big puddle, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wont be writing from the UK cos I&#39;ll have no computer access :-(<br/>
but I&#39;ll be back by June. Much as I want to go home, it s taking time plus I wouldn&#39;t want to miss the SC conference!!<br/>
Anyone else want to break their journey in Virginia is welcome too. then we could head down to SC as a Unschooling convoy :-)<br/>

It&#39;s non-age-discriminatory. Anyone can be anywhere. Last year most of the <br/>
kids were fine &quot;on their own&quot; in the funshop rooms. This year we have the <br/>
main speaker room with a small &quot;Toddler Room&quot; attached. Next door there will <br/>
be a large ballroom with funshops going all day. (Most are not posted <br/>
yet---still waiting for contract confirmation.) Some parents would &quot;divide & <br/>
conquer&quot;, but most just checked in every so often---or the children would. <br/>
But the children are also welcome in the main speaker room. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes...  Liam and I were talking about the upcoming conference and Liam, an <br/>
unschooler&#39;s unschooler, said, &quot;I will be happy to go to this conference as <br/>
long as you don&#39;t try to tell me where to go and what to do.&quot;  I told him, <br/>
&quot;Ummm, I don&#39;t remember actually doing that last time.&quot;  And he replied, <br/>
&quot;Well, you didn&#39;t, but sometimes you tried to.&quot;  He reminded me that the <br/>
conference was a big success for him because he was able to have so much <br/>
fun with Sierra and Jared just playing and doing their own thing <br/>
(especially with Sierra).<br/>
<br/>
My point is that while there were tons of things that were organized for <br/>
kids to do, the children also had the space and freedom to create their own <br/>
experiences.  So, while Liam was not really interested in participating in <br/>
the unweaving funshop (and, MAN, was that fun), he enjoyed the unweaving <br/>
after it was all done and, in his own inimitable way, created his own <br/>
experience for himself out of it.  That&#39;s just who he is and the way he <br/>
does things.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks may have a huge problem with that, but, I believe that <br/>
Unschooling honors that in a person, and the conference more than embodied <br/>
Unschooling because the children were free to be Who They Are and get the <br/>
experience *they want* to get from it.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I got this amazingly beautiful hand-felted hat, great talking <br/>
sticks, books, tapes...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this made any sense at all, but I just want to point out <br/>
that there is ample loving space at this conference for the most <br/>
nonconformist, individualistic, can&#39;t-tell-&#39;em-what-to-do kinds of kids.<br/>
