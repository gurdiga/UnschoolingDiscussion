&lt;&lt;  I&#39;m up to April 3rd, now, and MAN, I wish I could <br/>
<br/>
re-visit some posts! LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t hurt a thing for you to comment on things that are a month or a <br/>
year old.  There are people reading who are at all stages of considerations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This group really seems close-knit and the caring and support you show <br/>
each <br/>
<br/>
other is something I really like. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No way 1500 people are a close-knit group!  I think there are people who feel <br/>
an affection for and interest in others who have proven their deep and honest <br/>
interest in figuring out how unschooling does and doesn&#39;t work.  Some people <br/>
here have met each other at conferences.  Some are e-mail buddies, but there <br/>
are lots of people here whose list-voices I really like yet we&#39;ll probably <br/>
never meet in person.  That&#39;s okay.  We&#39;re still involved in working together in a <br/>
volunteer-work kind of way, and that&#39;s a bond.  Just like you can really like <br/>
someone you&#39;re spending an EarthDay cleanup afternoon with, and have lunch <br/>
together and then be content to never see each other afterwards, there are <br/>
people whose only connection is they had a really good time learning about <br/>
unschooling together.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, you can bring up any topic no matter how old. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Go for it!<br/>

a &quot;subject&quot; title in my intro! It was late, and I&#39;ll claim extreme <br/>
tiredness! :~)<br/>
