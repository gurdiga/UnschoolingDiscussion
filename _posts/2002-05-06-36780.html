<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699170354">&lt;&lt; My dh still can&#39;t pronounce Hermione, even after watching Harry Potter<br/>
twice! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just had to speak up. My girls are very big fans of Harry Potter. They have spent a great deal of time online finding the best sites on Harry Potter. This one is so much fun. If you haven&#39;t been to it, you&#39;ve missed on a great chance to hear the words pronounced. Follow this link, then under Harry&#39;s head there is a link for Pronunciations, go to that, scroll down to find the word you want... click on the word, and like magic, it says the word for you. : )<br/>
