I havn&#39;t heard of his children&#39;s songs,  I&#39;ll have to check into it.<br/>
When is the Yosemite concert?<br/>
Does he do it every year?<br/>
<br/>
I also love Morning Coffee and Dream Cafe,   to me his concerts are so<br/>
fun,  his side comments are<br/>
hilarious.<br/>

The concert in Yosemite is a 4 day festival.  There are 2 of them during<br/>
the year spring and summer.  It&#39;s called the Strawberry Music Festival<br/>
is the web site is  www.strawberrymusic.com<br/>
It&#39;s so much fun!  Lots of things for kids to do and their parents.<br/>
Greg Brown hasn&#39;t performed there since 1998, and I just went to the<br/>
site to see if the line up for next year was up yet and it&#39;s not, so I<br/>
don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll be back this year.<br/>
The funny this that Arlo Guthrie perfomed last year - almost made up for<br/>
not having Greg Brown there.<br/>

Kate<br/>
who&#39;s only a little musical but is raising children with their father&#39;s<br/>
musical abilities</div>
