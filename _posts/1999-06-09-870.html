<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965640083">Hi, all!<br/>
<br/>
I was becoming uncomfortable with some of the postings on this list and I <br/>
thought it was just me, but there are a few others as well, so if I might <br/>
have your attention for a moment I would like to present some reminders and a <br/>
proposal.<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.com is an incredible resource for the homeschooling <br/>
community.  There is a mountain of material on homeschooling in general, but <br/>
it&#39;s hard to find some clear, quality unschooling support.  Not only are <br/>
there essays and FAQs and message boards, there is a mail list!<br/>
<br/>
If those message boards fill up with things which aren&#39;t unschooling related, <br/>
or if the mailing list goes off on structured-learning tangents and doesn&#39;t <br/>
come back, it will be harder for people to get the focussed support they <br/>
should be able to expect in an area called unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of people on this list and I&#39;m glad of it, and I don&#39;t work <br/>
for the forum, I&#39;m just someone on the list.  But as others have inquired of <br/>
me as though they think I might be able to redirect the flow of these <br/>
mailings, I am bravely going to ask that conversations which encourage <br/>
structured learning over unschooling be minimized or eliminated and that <br/>
conversations which have nothing to do with either of those be taken to <br/>
private e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Now someone who actually works on the forum might come along and ask me to <br/>
quit asking anyone to change anything, but that&#39;s a risk I&#39;ll take for the <br/>
sake of helping keep this list fascinating and useful for the unschoolers who <br/>
might sign on just now as I&#39;m writing this, or next weekend when a bunch of <br/>
us are away, or next month.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also ask that the most experienced homeschoolers among us go and post <br/>
something in the message boards at www.unschooling.com at least once a week, <br/>
if not more.   If we spend all our energy here we won&#39;t be building as <br/>
glorious a life-changing resource on the internet.   We can keep children in <br/>
distant states from suffering the indignity of being put through school at <br/>
home if we provide their parents with inspiring alternative information.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216428687">&lt;&lt;I think a lot of the talk about curriculum, though, is more about resources<br/>
for unschoolers than actual &quot;schoolwork&quot;. I know that I&#39;ve been better able<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m afraid some of the newer unschoolers will think they might want to buy a <br/>
curriculum.  It&#39;s not only unnecessary, it can be counterproductive.  If we <br/>
don&#39;t get away from school concepts like &quot;third grade science&quot; and &quot;second <br/>
grade reading&quot; and &quot;Jr. High math&quot; we won&#39;t be unschooling, really.  We&#39;ll be <br/>
holding our breath hoping for the best in the shade of an overwhelming <br/>
school-shaped structure which we&#39;re pretending to ignore.  <br/>
<br/>
Undo that structure.  If as a mom you want to sneak a peek at a checklist or <br/>
a curriculum and you HAVE to do that to remain calm, then fine.  But if you <br/>
press your children into a school-style form and decide on your success and <br/>
failure based on what the schools claim to be doing with and for children the <br/>
age your child is, it will be hard to give yourself the leeway to accept your <br/>
child&#39;s own pace, his own starts and lulls and frenzies and fallow seasons.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it will be more beneficial to those starting to unschool to hear how <br/>
they can do without a curriculum than to go to websites dedicated to the sale <br/>
of things they don&#39;t need in order to unschool and which might, in fact, keep <br/>
them from unschooling successfully.   As surely as formula feeding &quot;just half <br/>
the time&quot; will sabotage a  nursing relationship between mother and baby, <br/>
using a curriculum for some subjects and not others will ruin the integrity <br/>
of unschooling.  A child whose parents don&#39;t really commit to unchooling can <br/>
receive the message that reading or math is REALLY important and couldn&#39;t <br/>
possibly be left up to him to learn for fun, but that science and music and <br/>
history and poetry are disposable and unnecessary and he can learn them or <br/>
not.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my concern.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand your feelings and i pretty much agree about the list and<br/>
posting. But I am not sure i agree here. I would not say we use a<br/>
curriculum here. But I do need help from some workbooks and text books to<br/>
teach isaac what he wants to know. for example, he wasnt getting division<br/>
the way i was teaching him. yes he asked to learn it cus we have a game we<br/>
play that uses it so i got out a work books that explains how to do it and<br/>
i showed him that method. and it worked. It doesnt mean math is more<br/>
important then everything else.<br/>
<br/>
although I do think there are certain things i want him to learn adn<br/>
certain things that help people in this world. Like dealing with others and<br/>
math and even english. However, i wont use a curriculum to teach them and i<br/>
take my cue from him. english can be tuaght by reading any books.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;m wondering is why anyone uses the phrase &quot;can be taught&quot; at all,<br/>
especially in an unschooling forum.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s this sort of language we need to be very aware of and careful about.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m far more interested in the ways in which people learn than in how<br/>
anything &quot;can be taught&quot;.  I don&#39;t *want* to teach my children.  I don&#39;t<br/>
look for ways in which things can be taught, workbooks or not.  I&#39;m not<br/>
trying to get my children to be interested in or learn any particular<br/>
things.  I have no need to do so, they do it quite well without my<br/>
interference.  I have no list anywhere, even in my head, of what they need<br/>
to know or &quot;cover&quot;, we simply don&#39;t think that way here.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a problem understanding what people mean by &quot;English&quot; in this<br/>
context.  I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing.  There are lots of things<br/>
about language and words and writing and reading and thinking that are<br/>
interesting and useful to know.  I don&#39;t think anyone is interested in<br/>
learning &quot;English&quot;, the whole kit and kaboodle as a concrete single entity,<br/>
but most people are interested in bits of things here and there that might<br/>
fall under that subject in school.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way about any of the &quot;school subjects&quot;.  History is not a<br/>
single thing.  Math is not a thing.  Those are very, very broad categories<br/>
into which many, many different things and kinds of things fall, and it&#39;s<br/>
those things that interest people, not the broad category.  You can&#39;t teach<br/>
math or history or any broad subject any more than you could teach<br/>
&quot;universe&quot; or &quot;infinity&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552048201">Thanks to all who helped me with resources for helping me write my first<br/>
homeschooling proposal for the town. I hope nobody misunderstood and<br/>
thought I was looking for a curriculum  because I have no intent on using<br/>
one. As this is my first time writing a letter of intent to the<br/>
superintendent, I want it to sound meaty enough to pass muster without<br/>
saying that we&#39;ll be covering anything specific. That&#39;s no easy task, and I<br/>
don&#39;t want to spend my summer doing it. So some of the outlines and links<br/>
you have provided here have helped me get started and given me ideas on how<br/>
to word things. In this state, the school superintendent can (and did) ask<br/>
for an educational plan and a review of texts and instructional materials<br/>
to be used to determine the type of subjects to be covered. I guess you<br/>
have to talk a lot about what the child has been doing recently that<br/>
coordinates with the state&#39;s frameworks, and say something about expanding<br/>
on these themes as interest dictates?? <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I took up too much space on this mailing list about this subject,<br/>
but as a new unschooler I have appreciated feedback about this irritating<br/>
part of the homeschooling process!  What message board at uschooling.com<br/>
would address this topic?<br/>

But, but......come over to my kitchen and sit with me for awhile and let&#39;s <br/>
chew on the idea that you won&#39;t use cirriculum to teach, you&#39;ll just use <br/>
other things.  I have all kinds of tea, what&#39;s your favorite??  :)<br/>
<br/>
See, it&#39;s not not using cirriculum that&#39;s the wonderful thing about <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s the not teaching part.  It&#39;s the learning that the kids <br/>
just do that&#39;s  amazing.  Now, in my home there are myraid things to use to <br/>
learn with, including *curriculum*.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really fuzzy line at times, but I think what we are trying to say is <br/>
that once you shift your focus from not worrying about what you use to teach, <br/>
the next item is to shift from is the idea you need to teach.  Which becomes <br/>
even more fuzzy when you think, &quot;but I have to answer their questions!&quot;  Of <br/>
course we do. I have one child that is a champion question asker. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
If you work very hard at changing the language you use, it&#39;s much easier to <br/>
see unschooling clearly.  <br/>

With all due respect, I don&#39;t personally know you, or your credentials, but, <br/>
as a homeschooling mom, wanting and needing a place to share, I think this <br/>
list is great, and should be left as it is.  I don&#39;t want to offend you or <br/>
anyone else, but I feel that this list has helped a lot of people to voice <br/>
their fears and joys, and I don&#39;t think it should be regulated to what you <br/>
have suggested.  People have to learn and grow as they go, and having a place <br/>
to voice their questions, uncertainties, and fears, as well as their triumphs <br/>
is the best thing that can happen to any viable group.  Just my humble <br/>
opinion.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m far more interested in the ways in which people learn than in how<br/>
anything &quot;can be taught&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One good way to discover and weed out some of our school-based thinking is to <br/>
replace all phrases using &quot;teach&quot; with phrases using &quot;learn.&quot;   Learning is <br/>
an absolute.  Teaching is very abstract and once removed from action.  <br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot; is no more than talking about something, or demonstrating it, or <br/>
answering questions about it.  It is possible to talk to a fence post, <br/>
demonstrate to the wall, or answer questions which were left in writing by <br/>
someone who is a thousand miles away now (physically or mentally).  <br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot; has no object, really.  Teaching is song and dance, possibly <br/>
without an audience.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;LEARNING,&quot; though is an entirely solid-state, tangible matter.  Inside the <br/>
learner real connections are being made.  <br/>
<br/>
Another analogy in the &quot;been there, done that&quot; category:  Women need to be <br/>
empowered to make their own informed decisions about pregnancy, childbirth, <br/>
and nursing.  Even now, I&#39;ll hear a woman say, &quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me [do <br/>
whatever]&quot; or &quot;My doctor says I can&#39;t go out of town.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I correct them gently, every time. I just rephrase:  &quot;You mean your doctor <br/>
recommends that you stay in town?&quot;   If they&#39;re resistent to the gentle <br/>
shift, if they don&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying, I might say something stronger, <br/>
like &quot;Is it the doctor&#39;s baby?&quot;  or  &quot;Why did you give the doctor the power <br/>
to tell you what to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with education, the state, the school district, and teaching.<br/>
<br/>
If pregnant-you says (and thinks) &quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me eat bananas&quot; it <br/>
will affect your self image, your freedom, your power, and your attitude <br/>
toward the ownership of the unborn baby.   If an aspiring unschooler says and <br/>
believes, &quot;The state makes me...&quot; or &quot;The district says we have to...&quot; then <br/>
you might as well get a curriculum.  If doing what you think a school <br/>
administrator &quot;requires&quot; is more important to you than empowering your child <br/>
to learn and empowering yourself to support and protect his learning <br/>
environment then unschooling might not be possible for you.<br/>
<br/>
Much of this is attitude and confidence and self-assurance.   If you believe <br/>
in theory that unschooling can work and you DO IT, and it works, you will <br/>
confidently continue.  If you believe it but you don&#39;t try it, how can you <br/>
continue?  How can you have seconds if you haven&#39;t had firsts??<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t believe it will work and you claim you tried it and it didn&#39;t <br/>
work, how could you have given it a fair trial if you never really took a <br/>
deep breath and jumped off that cliff?  If you were standing holding on to <br/>
the teaching-branch on the edge of the cliff and just dangled your kid over <br/>
the edge and then brought him back and said &quot;it didn&#39;t work,&quot; you haven&#39;t <br/>
unschooled.  <br/>
<br/>
Summertime is a good time for trial unschooling.  If summer isn&#39;t supposed to <br/>
be learning time and kids learn a ton, why change anything when September <br/>

our holiday &quot;lesson Plan&quot; after the fact was not construed as an<br/>
endorsement of such things as teaching tools.  I  do a workshop<br/>
at conferences on &quot;how to see what your child is learning when<br/>
you haven&#39;t been teaching them anything&quot;, as many (especially<br/>
new) unschooling parents feel insecure about &quot;not doing anything&quot;<br/>
and find it useful to have tools to see what their kids are<br/>
really accomplishing while carrying on with their lives.  This<br/>
sort of thing can help people to relax and butt out, so to<br/>
speak.  <br/>

I just wanted to clarify this.<br/>

 I feel the same way about any of the &quot;school subjects&quot;.  History is not a<br/>
 single thing.  Math is not a thing.  Those are very, very broad categories<br/>
 into which many, many different things and kinds of things fall, and it&#39;s<br/>
 those things that interest people, not the broad category.  You can&#39;t teach<br/>
 math or history or any broad subject any more than you could teach<br/>
 &quot;universe&quot; or &quot;infinity&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes, it&#39;s almost impossible to get those ideas out of your head.  It&#39;s <br/>
okay, the goal is not to put them in your child&#39;s head.  My kids use <br/>
workbooks and puzzle books to learn with. Matter of fact my oldest is so dang <br/>
methodical she drive me nutty.  Living with me has been hard on her.  She&#39;s <br/>
used tons of workbooks, whether they were produced to be curriculum or just <br/>
fun stuff for kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Sandra and Linda were really pointing out is not the use of any <br/>
one kind of material, but the little nagging issue of control.  It&#39;s very <br/>
hard to give up control ...over anything that has meaning in our lives.  And <br/>
society has pounded into our heads that our children are out of control and <br/>
if we don&#39;t maintain a tight grip things are just going to get worse.  Teach <br/>
them is an issue of control in the way the larger society uses the word to <br/>
mean to force someone to learn something.. So, some of us react to that word <br/>
in ways that seem out of proportion. I know that Sandra and I have had many <br/>
discussions that centered around the word *teach*.<br/>
<br/>
Diving deeply into just what we are doing is what I hope we do on this list.  <br/>
There are many lists that discuss the how of unschooling. How kids learn math <br/>
by cooking and how grammar and vocabulary are logical outgrowths of reading <br/>
and speaking.  The why we choose this path, the why isn&#39;t discussed as much.  <br/>
I think we who are living daily with the different kind of how need to <br/>
observe, discuss, and analyze why what we are doing is working so well.  In <br/>
the coming years there are going to be an awful lot of people coming to us <br/>
and asking us how they can recreate what we have discovered on a larger <br/>
scale. If we aren&#39;t conversent with the why, the whole culture loses out.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortuately, asking those why questions can be tricky. It sounds accusatory <br/>
to say, &quot;why did you do that?&quot;.  This medium can also be a drawback, without <br/>
body language and tones of voice to guide us, it&#39;s very easy to read a snarky <br/>
attitude into what really was just a genuine question.<br/>
<br/>
There are some deep thinkers on this list and I, for one, hope they feel safe <br/>
in posing and talking about these issues.  While it may feel uncomfortable at <br/>
first, especially if you are new to unschooling, in the long run these <br/>
discussions will make us all stronger.<br/>

Those who aren&#39;t committed to unschooling can benefit tons, if the <br/>
conversation is kept in unschooling range and focus.   If the unschooling <br/>

If I go to a Baptist church I&#39;m not going to stand up and start praising <br/>
Buddha.  I&#39;m not even going to say &quot;Blessed Virgin Mary!&quot;   There are times <br/>
and places for things, and any list called unschooling-dotcom needs to be for <br/>
and about unschooling.  That was my whole point.  If everyone who goes to <br/>
church is saved the preachin&#39; can be cut short and the lunch can last longer. <br/>
 If everyone on this list was an avowed, experienced unschooler there would <br/>
be less need to keep it on topic.  There are new homeschoolers here, though, <br/>
and new unschoolers, and so for them we need to preach more clearly.  (Former <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233801298">I just read the reply from Teresa concerning the changes that may or may<br/>
not occur on this list. I must say that I&#39;m not quite sure what the<br/>
problem exactly was to begin with, but I do agree with her. I do know of<br/>
many people who have started homeschooling and wanted to do so with a<br/>
curriculum. I believe it&#39;s from insecurities they have as to all of a<br/>
sudden being &quot;teacher.&quot; I also know many of them that end up as<br/>
unschoolers. Mostly because of the support they receive from others and<br/>
the confidence that grows within them.<br/>
As to posts directed at one person. I know that if someone asks a<br/>
question, there are many others that become interested and therefore<br/>
want the answers as well. I don&#39;t think there really are unschooling<br/>
topics because it is a way of life and doesn&#39;t that include everything?<br/>
Our questions and answers regarding tadpoles and butterflies sparked new<br/>
interest in others. If that was answered privately, think of what would<br/>
have been missed.<br/>
Now to post to say &quot;thank you&quot; I think that would be best taken<br/>
privately unless it goes out to us all.<br/>
Maybe I missed the point of what exactly people were upset about.<br/>

&gt;observe, discuss, and analyze why what we are doing is working so well.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;ll start.  Why. That answer would be different depending on which<br/>
child I was talking about. But what it would come down to in the end is<br/>
that I trust their abilities/desires enough to let them learn what they<br/>
choose to.  I also respect them enough as individuals not to choose for<br/>
them what should be important for them.  <br/>
<br/>
When my children left school we had a lot of things to sort out. First was<br/>
what each of us felt was education. The one thing we all agreed on was that<br/>
the &quot;subjects&quot; were too narrowly defined by the system and produced<br/>
(hopefully if the students memorized it all and retained it) cookie cutter<br/>
graduates.   Once we realized that, then we had to look at how much of what<br/>
was taught in school was needed. Of course math is needed daily, but we<br/>
knew that it could be learned in a better way.  A way that would stay with<br/>
us and rote memorization wasn&#39;t it. <br/>
<br/>
once we found unschooling we realized just how little we had known when we<br/>
figured out the above questions in the beginning.  The boys were shocked to<br/>
learn how much more was out there that they hadn&#39;t had time to learn when<br/>
sitting in a classroom.  I was at first surprised by how much I could learn<br/>
from them. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, (to keep this from getting too long) I wanted my children to<br/>
regain the self esteem that they originally had when I sent them off to<br/>
school.  I believe very strongly that without self esteem you won&#39;t find<br/>
happiness and if my children have nothing else in their lives I want them<br/>
to find a happiness within themselves.  The only approach to learning that<br/>
we feel allows us the time to explore ourselves and our world is unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;In <br/>

unschooling and reap the benefits in their families.<br/>

going to get support if we are bickering among ourselves as to who is more<br/>
radical, more &quot;devout&quot; or most &quot;UN&quot;??  I think what matters here is child<br/>

all get along.  I was quite enjoying the list as it was, and I think that<br/>
everyone is now on the defensive, thinking they were not &quot;with the<br/>

deteriorate into a general chat forum, and not a place for Unschoolers to<br/>

I have to put my .02 in here. I was happy to see that the discussion about<br/>
curriculum not happen here. I&#39;ve seen too many unschooling lists where<br/>
curriculums are the main subjects after a while.  I was hoping this list<br/>
would be different and avoid curriculums. We have not used curriculums<br/>
(except a few workbooks the first two months and they got shelved real<br/>
fast!) so I&#39;m not really looking for discussion on them.   This is only our<br/>
second year unschooling, so I&#39;m not really an expert here. I would like to<br/>
learn more from those who have unschooled longer to see the potential that<br/>
we could reach. While I am happy where we are heading, it is always nice to<br/>
have a little help. <br/>

of life. If my child asks me for help, great, I&#39;ll try and provide it, one way<br/>
or the other, but hey, I&#39;ve got my own life to lead. I don&#39;t want to be led by<br/>
anyone - just as my kids don&#39;t really like being led themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Not stifling creativity, and letting my<br/>
&gt; children have the freedom to learn from whatever forms they choose is more<br/>
&gt; important to me than arguing over principles that, much like Theology, are<br/>
&gt; open to interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Principles are the basis of my life, but they aren&#39;t static - my principles<br/>
develop as I learn, listen and think. So discussion of principles is very<br/>
important to me. Furthermore, creativity without principles leads to<br/>
Frankenstein monsters, IMO. I am not always the unschooler I would like to be,<br/>
because of my own background and hang ups. Without the principles, my attempts<br/>
at unschooling would have been buried under a pile of half used curriculum long<br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No one OWNS the concept of Unschooling, there is no Pope of Unschooling to<br/>
&gt; pass judgement on what is the correct way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True. But there is a general consensus of what unshooling is. And if I want to<br/>
talk about cats, I&#39;ll join a list about cats. I won&#39;t join up to dog.com and<br/>
expect people to be happy with me talking about cats.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I agree that we should<br/>
&gt; all get along.  I was quite enjoying the list as it was, and I think that<br/>
&gt; everyone is now on the defensive, thinking they were not &quot;with the<br/>
&gt; program.&quot;  I also agree that it is important for the list not to<br/>
&gt; deteriorate into a general chat forum, and not a place for Unschoolers to<br/>
&gt; learn and grow, but nobody can learn and grow with all the noise around<br/>
&gt; here about who is &quot;right&quot; and who knows best.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep getting excited when I find an unschooling site or list, expecting to be<br/>
helped and encouraged along the unschooling path. I keep being disillusioned<br/>
when I find talk of curriculum, and how to motivate kids to do things they<br/>
aren&#39;t interested in etc. There are heaps of sites and lists for those who are<br/>
interested in such things. So why do people want to discuss such things here<br/>
rather than there?<br/>

Does your local homeschooling support group have a library?  That&#39;s what I did<br/>
with mine.<br/>

<br/>
Great question.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are people who want to borrow our cool ideas, without having to <br/>
embrace our reckless &lt;gasp!&gt; philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
When I was on AOL, I didn&#39;t mind a non-unschooler entering the unschooling <br/>
folder, admitting to not being an unschooler, and asking for book <br/>
recommendations or resource info.  I figured it was a compliment, that we <br/>
unschoolers as a group were deeply knowledgeable about novels and craft kits <br/>
and a zillion other neat things.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it&#39;s a different case when non-unschoolers enter a discussion and start <br/>
giving out advice to a group that has been brought together for the purpose <br/>
of sharing unschooling advice.  That would be annoying.  That&#39;s why sometimes <br/>
we unschoolers mount an ideological crusade.<br/>
<br/>
(Disclaimer:  I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened here on this list.  I just <br/>
joined a couple of days ago.  I don&#39;t know what the ideological issues are <br/>
right now on this list.  I didn&#39;t notice any curriculum discussions.  And I <br/>
think writing the dreaded letter to the superintendent IS an issue that IS <br/>
appropriate to this list.)<br/>

     I am also excited about finding a good unschooling list.  In my <br/>
situation, being a new unschooler (and coming from a family of public school <br/>
teachers) I am looking for verification that it is &quot;okay&quot; if my child is <br/>
being unmotivated.  I am not trying to turn the conversation into <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; or into &quot;school-at-home&quot; tactics.  I am, however, feeling very <br/>
confused and discouraged with the people around me (my public school <br/>
teachers-mom and dad-, and the very &quot;school-at-home&quot; homeschoolers around my <br/>
area) telling me that something is wrong with my 17 year old son.  They are <br/>
harping about him so much, and the fact that the only thing he is interested <br/>
in is science fiction or computer games, and they are constantly telling me <br/>
that I am hurting my child.  I am coming to this group, my only group of <br/>
support for unschooling, and begging for encouragement.  I am wanting all you <br/>
veteran unschoolers to tell me that it is okay if he is not motivated, and <br/>
that we should just continue to unschool like we are.  <br/>
     I am really sorry, if I made anyone feel like I wanted answers on a <br/>
curriculum, or if I made you feel like I was discussing traditional <br/>
schooling.  I just needed a pat on my back, and encouragement that my kids <br/>
are indeed normal and bright even if they aren&#39;t studying the &#39;traditional <br/>
and normal&#39; subjects.<br/>
