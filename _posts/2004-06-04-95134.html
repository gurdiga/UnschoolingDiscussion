Two hours is as arbitrary as one hour.  It is based on the clock and not on <br/>
the project/kid/surroundings/game.<br/>

Does anyone ever play longer than he actually wanted to because his two hours <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true. We discussed this and the kids felt that two hours was long enough to get <br/>
most things done. With five kids, it could be days of waiting if each child chose to be on <br/>
for endless hours (that was their thinking). I do have one child who plays easily for four <br/>
hours at a time if no one else wants to go on.<br/>
<br/>
So two hours is their decision as a way to ensure everyone gets some time.<br/>
<br/>
With multiple computers in the house now, that two hour limit is a lot less of an issue than <br/>
it used to be.<br/>

Sandra asked &lt;&lt;Does anyone ever play longer than he actually wanted to<br/>
because his two hours aren&#39;t up yet?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Every day. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So are you saying that your children stay on the computer even if they<br/>
really don&#39;t want to because they haven&#39;t used up their 2 hour time limit<br/>
yet?<br/>

I thought you asked if they got to play longer than two hours if they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
You asked if they keep playing for two hours when they *dont&#39;* want to just to use up their <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
I have never seen that happen.<br/>
<br/>
The two hour idea was theirs as a way to get daily computer time for five kids on one <br/>
computer. Now we have three computers available to them and it&#39;s not the issue it used to <br/>
be.<br/>

<br/>
So it&#39;s working like a TV-watching limit?<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is only allowed an hour of tv, it seems he will watch it no matter <br/>
how lame the hour is or how much he wanted to do something else, because if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t spend his hour, it&#39;s gone.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids who can watch it always will go a day or two without watching <br/>
anything at all.<br/>
