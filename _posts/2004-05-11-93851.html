<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833059150"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Why can you not homeschool them legally? What state are you in?<br/>
&gt;We are in Michigan.  You have to be a biological parent.  Not to<br/>
&gt;mention that biological mom is &quot;out there,&quot; so it&#39;s just not an<br/>
&gt;option.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enroll them in an umbrella school.  That should make them count as private <br/>
schoolers in the eyes of the Michigan powers that be.  (please confirm this <br/>
for yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one in Ann Arbor called Clonlara (or is it Conlara?) and she&#39;s <br/>
supposedly pretty hands-off if you want her to be.  If they&#39;re high school <br/>
aged, there&#39;s Wes Beach with his Beach High School or something <br/>
similar.  He enrolls kids and then when they&#39;re ready to graduate, writes <br/>
up a transcript of what they&#39;ve been doing with their lives.  Actually, any <br/>
Californian has to declare themselves a private school if they want to <br/>
legally homeschool, so find a californian who&#39;d be willing to umbrella you <br/>
and willing to deal with any Michigan paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the legal rigamarole.<br/>

<br/>
This is incorrect. I suggest visiting www.NHEN.org to get a list of the<br/>
local Michigan organizations and State statutes.<br/>
<br/>
Home Schoolers of California (www.hsc.org) details the FOUR different ways<br/>
you can homeschool legally in California, declaring yourself a private<br/>
school (commonly called R-4) being only one option.  <br/>
<br/>
Every state is different. Suggesting that people (who are not lawyers) from<br/>
one State can give help for another is less helpful than finding locals to<br/>
do so.<br/>
