<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837192176">Hey, Dawn~<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been told about a new scouting progaram called Spiral <br/>
Scouts for boys and girls.  You can check them out at <br/>
www.spiralscouts.org.  They have a program for little folks, and they <br/>
are more earth-friendly (pagan, actually) than traditional scouts.<br/>

Thanks Aimee.. any help with  this new venture is appreciated.  I didn&#39;t go <br/>
to girl scouts or brownies, actually I did for a few weeks, but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
follow the rules and wanted to make up my own so they asked me to leave (LOL)<br/>
