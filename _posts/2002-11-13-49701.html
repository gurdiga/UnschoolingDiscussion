<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322390991">How far would you go in encouraging a kid to stick with something <br/>
they&#39;ve started? My 10yo unschooler has been bugging us for the past <br/>
year to give him viola lessons (he has a passion for classical <br/>
music). Well, we finally found a program we could afford (group <br/>
lessons through our local university) and he started about 6 weeks <br/>
ago. The first handful of lessons were easy for him and he picked <br/>
things up quickly. NOW, however, the stuff is getting a bit more <br/>
challenging and he&#39;s starting to gripe about practicing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m torn between not wanting to force him to do something he&#39;s not <br/>
thoroughly enjoying and wishing he would actually stick with it long <br/>
enough feel a sense of accomplishment.  He has two one-hour lessons a <br/>
week and is expected to practice at home at least 5 days/week. I <br/>
don&#39;t *make* him practice that often; I&#39;m satisfied (and so is he) if <br/>
we get in a couple good sessions a week. I&#39;ve told him that as long <br/>
as he feels comfortable with his progress and doesn&#39;t get to his <br/>
lessons and feel &quot;lost&quot; he can practice at his discretion.<br/>
<br/>
He has not asked to quit (yet), but practice sessions are becoming a <br/>
bit of a battlefield. Learning a new skill, however much it&#39;s <br/>
desired, can be frustrating and it&#39;s all too easy to just give up <br/>
when things start getting tough. I know the challenges of learning to <br/>
play an instrument, but I also know the rewards of sticking with it. <br/>
Problem is that I&#39;m having trouble convincing him that the rewards <br/>
are worth the frustration!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457384978">We&#39;re in somewhat of the same place. What we did was get the girls a <br/>
video and a book (encore music - so far, so good). They practice on <br/>
their own. One prefers short practices but often, the other longer but <br/>
less frequent. I do ask them about it - did you practice? But they go at <br/>
their own pace, and do it their own way. They are doing well but I think <br/>
getting sometimes bored/frustrated. I&#39;d love to get them involved in <br/>
some sort of band, but there isn&#39;t one here, and I don&#39;t know that there <br/>
would be enough homeschoolers to get it to go. There&#39;s a youth symphony <br/>
orchestra, but the one dd is a year away from being ready, and the other <br/>
probably two or three.<br/>
<br/>
Their interest seems to go in spurts. I try to encourage without <br/>
pushing, but I do have the same concerns about getting through the tough <br/>
part of learning something new. Is it better to encourage, not push or <br/>
nag, but let it go when they miss a day or a week or more?  (actually, <br/>
we don&#39;t keep track of how often.)<br/>

8 yo dd goes in spurts. 12 yo dd wants to get through level one on her <br/>

we&#39;re going to look at it again in January. The 8 you I just kind of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683968430">My two, 9ds and 8dd,  were playing cello and violin last year,  we went through times where they weren&#39;t very excited about practicing and I did not force it.   Usually when they wanted to be prepared for a lesson they would get down to business.  One of our teachers was cool and she just wanted my dd to just have fun, which was great.  The other teacher was more like,  you practice on the days that you eat, kind-of philosophy.  Which didn&#39;t work with me.<br/>
 <br/>
I basically put the ball in their court, they wanted to take lessons so it was their responsibility to get their practice done.  And most of the time they did.<br/>
I might ask about it once in a while or if they asked me to remind them, but it wasn&#39;t stressful to me.<br/>
 <br/>
I really have to let it be their decision with intruments,  I love playing piano and violin, so I would really love them to play but if that&#39;s not for them, that&#39;s OK.<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248309264">Holly had a fiddle lesson yesterday.  She had practiced six of seven days, <br/>
and marked her chart carefully, and the teacher didn&#39;t ask to see it.  It <br/>
didn&#39;t bother Holly.  She felt like she&#39;d had a good lesson.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was teaching and when I was in school--if kids did <br/>
something and it &quot;didn&#39;t count,&quot; or was just glanced at instead of carefully <br/>
checked, some of them would be nearly furious, from having done it for <br/>
nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t know to do that. &lt;g&gt;  GOOD!<br/>

I&#39;d let him keep going even if he decides not to practice.<br/>
<br/>
I played cello throughout most of my childhood and nobody ever made me <br/>
practice. I had months and months where I never practiced at all - just <br/>
went to lessons. I had other months and months when I practiced 7 hours a <br/>
day, day after day. I do the same thing now - I get a lot of enjoyment out <br/>
of playing my cello, but I just do it when I feel like it. I&#39;m not all that <br/>
accomplished - but I really enjoy it and it gave me a much greater ability <br/>
to appreciate music on a different level than a nonmusician does (I think).<br/>
<br/>
Forcing unhappy practice sessions risks him losing all enjoyment, imo.<br/>

<br/>
So what do you play, when you do play?  Do you play in any groups?  I find<br/>
with both cello and horn that the only time I practice is when I&#39;ve got<br/>
something coming up, a chamber group or orchestra rehearsal or whatever.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because there&#39;s very little music written for either instrument<br/>
*alone*.  I could be working on solo accompanied music.  I have a friend who<br/>
plays piano really well.  But I just don&#39;t.<br/>

Couldn&#39;t you just play from any old music that&#39;s in range?  Just tunes?  <br/>
Dance tunes?  Melodies of stuff your kids like from kid-books?  Play along <br/>
with baroque stuff you have the music for?  Or Renaissance stuff with viol da <br/>
gamba parts?  The recorder sonatas which have those WONDERFUL basso continuo <br/>
parts?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654795835">I don&#39;t &quot;practice&quot; at all....I just pick up my cello and fool with it. I <br/>
play the melody line out of broadway musical books that my kids have left <br/>
around, a lot &lt;G&gt;. I play from solo books. I do a lot of just improvising - <br/>
that&#39;s mostly what I do. It is just for me - I don&#39;t play with a group. I <br/>
did play with a homeschooled kids&#39; orchestra for a couple of years - just <br/>
very beginning stuff, that was fun. I played some lines, solo, for a <br/>
Shakespeare company a couple of summers ago - it was just simple simple stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a Native American flute - I just improvise on that, too. I do <br/>
play that for people sometimes, when we&#39;re camping -- sometimes after <br/>
everybody goes off to their tents to go to sleep I sit out by the campfire <br/>
a bit longer and play while they fall asleep. Used to work WONDERS in <br/>
getting my girl scouts to fall asleep &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We have a piano, an electronic keyboard, a mandolin, a penny whistle, a <br/>
couple of recorders, an autoharp, my cello, a couple of violins, bongo <br/>
drums,  a guitar and probably other instruments. Most are old and crummy -- <br/>
and none of us are accomplished. Roya plays basic piano and guitar chords - <br/>
so do I. Roxana is learning to play piano - it has taken her a long time <br/>
since she never wanted lessons, but she&#39;s learning and now she&#39;s taking <br/>
piano class at the community college. Rosie plays too - I&#39;d call her an <br/>
advanced beginner.<br/>
<br/>
They/we all sing - all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Right now - Roxana is off working - helping with wardrobe at a musical <br/>
show. Roya is singing something very loudly - she&#39;s in the bathroom &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
Rosie is watching the Jesus Christ Superstar movie - we went and saw the <br/>
new US Tour production last week - with the ORIGINAL Judas (Carl Anderson) <br/>
who was awesome! Rox and I went to the opera - saw a lovely production of <br/>
La Boheme last week too. On Sunday we&#39;re going to see RENT.  Rosie went <br/>
last night to see a local musical production of Pinocchio which one of her <br/>
best friends is in - we&#39;re all going to see it next week.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d be listening to music too, except I&#39;m listening to the Harry Potter <br/>
audiotapes --- the British version read by Stephen Frye. Since my kids <br/>
won&#39;t hear of ANY of us seeing the new movie until we can all go together - <br/>
don&#39;t know when that will happen, we&#39;re all too busy.<br/>
