<div id="ygrps-yiv-295987044">The comments about Leidloff were on the Unschooling Basics list and not Always Learning. I&#39;m trained as an anthropologist, so my negative comments were in no way comments about the paucity of anthropology, although I could probably go there if it were required ;). I know many people have gained a new view from Leidloff&#39;s work. I suppose I&#39;m a bit like someone who can&#39;t read The Education of Little Tree without knowing that the author was lying about who he was and what he lived. I can&#39;t read Leidloff and get beyond her racist view of the Yekwana and other tribal people. <br/>

I read it when Kirby was a baby, so over 20 years ago.<br/>
What I took from it is that there are other cultures in which children  <br/>
are not set aside into kid-ghettos and nurseries, and that it seemed  <br/>
they were learning fine, or better.  That it was possible for parents  <br/>
to have their children with them more often, or to think more  <br/>
positively about the idea of children seeing and being around everyday  <br/>
adult activities.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t take that we should become another culture, just to know that  <br/>
our own was pretty screwed up and some others didn&#39;t have the &quot;normal&quot;  <br/>
problems we considered normal.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;mother blaming,&quot; there was a great objection to psychiatry and  <br/>
psychology when they first came around because people became less  <br/>

If there is to be an opposite of that, would it be that nothing  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271010677">I suppose you were reading that book at a time when the message of<br/>
integrating children in society was confined to very few places.  I think it<br/>
is amazing that you and others were able to pioneer that renaissance in our<br/>
society, though, as I see watered down versions in the heliocopter parents<br/>
and &quot;alternative&quot; parenting blogs have taken root.<br/>
<br/>
But there were so many other resources fifteen years ago for me to find that<br/>
message, that the medium mattered...though others gleaned other things about<br/>
respecting children, I sadly looked at the message and the context and<br/>
didn&#39;t get past it.  That message was so ingrained for me by the time I saw<br/>
it in that book, all I could see were the other things&lt;grin&gt;<br/>

I suppose that is one of the problems that I have with the book. It argues for such huge differences between people, it is a cultural determinist approach. As an evolutionist I don&#39;t predict that the differences are that great. From people I know who work with indigenous, tribal, peoples, the differences aren&#39;t as great as Leidloff paints. <br/>
<br/>
I think one of the problems with a book that is starting from a lie, like Margaret Mead&#39;s Samoan stuff, is that people become sure that what they live isn&#39;t biology, it is culture. I think it is environment and biology melding together into whatever is presented. Because that is my bias I don&#39;t believe that unschooling will make Simon or Linnaea radically different to someone else, but I do believe that it will give their biology different expression than if I traditionally parented. Leidloff didn&#39;t get me there.<br/>

Lots of parents got the idea that you should just let your kid into dangerous situation without support because that is the way the tribe did.<br/>

<br/>
Dangerous situations and kids working out disagreements and not giving  <br/>
kids toys could be taken from that, but only by people who intend to  <br/>
be lazy and stupid (in my dumbass opinion).<br/>
I only took what I felt I could see good use in, and use within this  <br/>
culture, because I never for a moment intended to have children and  <br/>
protect them from the world around them, or keep them separate from  <br/>
the modern world at all.<br/>
<br/>
Practically speaking, I believe it&#39;s possible for a family to get  <br/>
enough information from my unschooling site and Joyce&#39;s that they&#39;ll  <br/>
never need to read another parenting or learning-method book in their  <br/>
whole lives.  But nowhere on either of those sites does it say &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
read anything but this!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis has read more John Holt than I have.  She can be the Holt  <br/>
professor when this turns into a university.  [I am joking about the  <br/>
university; just a joke.]   I&#39;ve read enough Holt to know that it  <br/>
would be possible to pick and choose passages and quotes that would  <br/>
suggest what I should have done with my boys was to deprive them of TV  <br/>
and persuade them to join the Navy as soon as they could legally do  <br/>
so.    I read Holt intending to take what I could see good use in, and  <br/>
that I could use within this culture.<br/>

Leidloff wasn&#39;t an  unschooler.  Holt wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  Ideas are  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110113790">So what if kids are spanked because parents have little attention spans and kindness isn&#39;t what they are good at? What if culture justifies what is? like laws against incest that most people never even think about going against? What if your culture is just an overlay on the normal range of biology? The Yekwana, Leidloff&#39;s population, they hit their kids. Like the Garifuna that we lived with, they hit their kids, they rape their neighbors, and heck, the Yekwana are special in that they have slaves, the Yananomo. So, you may not be a dumbass to be excited by Leidloff&#39;s &quot;new ideas&quot; but Leidloff was a tourist travelling with some guys hoping to get their hands on cheap diamonds. Not necessarily the role model of choice. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing those were directed to me.<br/>
I thought my post was positive about attachment parenting, wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
In the 1980&#39;s, when I had my first two children, &quot;attachment  <br/>
parenting&quot; was something La Leche League talked about, and Liedloff&#39;s  <br/>
book was an officially approved book for group libraries.  La Leche  <br/>
League was very strict about what books could and should be  <br/>
recommended to those who attended meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, at some point, there came to be a separate &quot;attachment  <br/>
parenting&quot; organization, and I&#39;ve heard that they&#39;ve gone in  <br/>
particular directions that have nothing to do with the LLL origins of  <br/>
the idea.<br/>
<br/>
For me, it doesn&#39;t matter because my kids are already grown, and  <br/>
because I took what I wanted from LLL and attachment parenting, too.<br/>

La Leche League was recommending attachment parenting, and saying it  <br/>
was good for moms to carry babies, and let them sleep with them, and  <br/>
not to press children to leave or to be apart until the children  <br/>
wanted to walk off or explore.<br/>
<br/>
There were two books recommended, in the mid-80&#39;s, at La Leche League  <br/>
meetings and in their literature and catalogs about that.  One was The  <br/>
Continuum Concept.  The other was The Family Bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878843822">As a former LLL leader, it seemed to me that &quot;we&quot; were saying &quot;wear  <br/>
your baby,&quot; &quot;trust your baby,&quot; &quot;include your baby in your day-to-day  <br/>
routines&quot; and so on because it worked for indigenous peoples (and we&#39;d  <br/>
forgotten those things in our culture). Her book pointed to a  <br/>
different way of being with children that most of us had been brought  <br/>
up with.<br/>
<br/>
It justified what we were saying, in an anthropological way. We  <br/>
weren&#39;t just crazy women, nursing our children for years, carrying our  <br/>
babies and children in slings, letting them play with dangerous tools,  <br/>
and trusting their &quot;cues&quot; for nothing! There was proof that it had  <br/>
been done before we cooked it up &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t like everything in the book, either, but some things made  <br/>
sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038041034">The main thing I took from the &#39;Continuum Concept&#39; was to trust our babies/children.  Babies cry to get their needs met, they don&#39;t cry just to be an inconvenience.  The children in this tribe were fully trusted and in turn fully trusted the adults around them.  From the time they could toddle around they knew where to go for food, closeness & play.  They weren&#39;t hindered, they were free.  The parents were always available if needed.<br/>
<br/>
The tribe didn&#39;t &quot;let&quot; their kids into dangerous situations, these kids from a very young age were around said situations daily and knew how to navigate safely.  It&#39;s different in our society, most kids can&#39;t even jump on the couch or bed because the adults fear they will hurt themselves.  For instance my children have never been around horses and I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable letting them be around horses without me, yet when I was 8 I regularly went out and saddled up my own horse by myself to go for a ride because I had been around that my whole life.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t take from the book for us &quot;civilized&quot; people to copy the way these people lived, it&#39;s just not possible in our society, but I took a lot from the book that I could apply in my own life and in my children&#39;s lives that was for the better.<br/>

&gt; That kids should work disagreements by themselves unassisted.<br/>
&gt; That toys are not even good and kids are better off without them.<br/>
&gt; That is what I remember right now. But I know there were many more  <br/>
&gt; issues I had with the book.<br/>
&gt; IT may be good for some parents and a step in the right direction even  <br/>
&gt; but I just did not like it at all.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dangerous situations and kids working out disagreements and not giving  <br/>
&gt; kids toys could be taken from that, but only by people who intend to  <br/>
&gt; be lazy and stupid (in my dumbass opinion).<br/>
&gt; I only took what I felt I could see good use in, and use within this  <br/>
&gt; culture, because I never for a moment intended to have children and  <br/>
&gt; protect them from the world around them, or keep them separate from  <br/>
&gt; the modern world at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Practically speaking, I believe it&#39;s possible for a family to get  <br/>
&gt; enough information from my unschooling site and Joyce&#39;s that they&#39;ll  <br/>
&gt; never need to read another parenting or learning-method book in their  <br/>
&gt; whole lives.  But nowhere on either of those sites does it say &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; read anything but this!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Deb Lewis has read more John Holt than I have.  She can be the Holt  <br/>
&gt; professor when this turns into a university.  [I am joking about the  <br/>
&gt; university; just a joke.]   I&#39;ve read enough Holt to know that it  <br/>
&gt; would be possible to pick and choose passages and quotes that would  <br/>
&gt; suggest what I should have done with my boys was to deprive them of TV  <br/>
&gt; and persuade them to join the Navy as soon as they could legally do  <br/>
&gt; so.    I read Holt intending to take what I could see good use in, and  <br/>
&gt; that I could use within this culture.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Leidloff wasn&#39;t an  unschooler.  Holt wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  Ideas are  <br/>
&gt; ideas.<br/>

I do feel slightly insulted by your responses &quot;maybe some people never question what they read.&quot; I question everything, including some unschooling ideas.<br/>
Taking a break from the list now, but still very appreciative of it.<br/>

We&#39;ve discussed that book here too (both of them, I think), so no  <br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
Some people won&#39;t listen to Michael Jackson&#39;s music because they think  <br/>
he might be nasty.<br/>
Some families make their kids study Beethoven and Bach, but don&#39;t let  <br/>
them hear Mozart because Mozart didn&#39;t become a church organist and  <br/>
write masses.  Insufficiently religious.<br/>
Some people will reject reading my books because I embarrassed their  <br/>
friend&#39;s friend one time, they think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not glad that Bob Dylan claims to have written everything he  <br/>
touches, so that it&#39;s impossible to tell what really was original and  <br/>
what was borrowed from tradition.   So sometimes I get cranky when a  <br/>
song is really good, or I start humming Bob Dylan. &lt;bwg&gt;  The other  <br/>
day someone sent me links to some of his bizarro recent Christmas  <br/>
stuff, and he had &quot;copyrighted&quot; the words and music to &quot;Must Be  <br/>
Santa.&quot;  AS IF!!!   It&#39;s like a habit, like a verbal tic, &quot;Words and  <br/>
music by Bob Dylan.&quot;  He probably says that after he sings &quot;Happy  <br/>
Birthday&quot; to someone.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, sometimes there is emotion about an author or artist or  <br/>
musician.  I know that.<br/>
