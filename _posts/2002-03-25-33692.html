<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932328255">If you are referring to linguistics or grammar, passive voice is when the subject of the<br/>
sentence is not what or who is doing the action. In active voice, the subject is doing the<br/>
action. My old writing professor said it is who&#39;s kicking whom.<br/>
<br/>
The ball was kicked by me.  (passive voice -- the ball (the subject) did NOT do the<br/>
kicking)<br/>
I kicked the ball. (active voice -- I (the subject) did the kicking)<br/>
<br/>
This difference is VERY important in effective writing. I spent a half a year on it,<br/>
although &quot;mommy brain&quot; has deteriorated my writing. Good writing will consist of almost<br/>
all active voice. It causes less confusion and is less wordy.<br/>
<br/>
Passive voice, however, is used when blame needs to be shifted. &quot;The vase was broken.&quot; It<br/>
does not imply who broke it, so it sounds better when you tell mommy that as opposed to &quot;I<br/>
broke the vase.&quot; Passive voice uses mostly the &quot;to be&quot; verbs --is, are, was, were, am etc.<br/>
These are non-active verbs. When editing, you should try to eliminate as many of these as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

<br/>
Josefa has explained it already pretty well!<br/>
<br/>
A true-life story involving passive voice was about a car being wrecked.  <br/>
Twenty years ago, Keith was living in Salt Lake City and a bunch of us were <br/>
meeting in Phoenix.  He didn&#39;t show up.  He and a friend named Margaret had <br/>
borrowed a car from another friend, and in the middle of the night &quot;the car <br/>
wrecked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith wasn&#39;t driving.  But Margaret told her mom the WHOLE story without <br/>
mentioning that.  Details!  There were rocks in the road, the car was <br/>
raining, the police came, the oil pan was totally off, the transmission was <br/>
jammed, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Margaret&#39;s mom called me to inquire about Keith, and said &quot;This isn&#39;t the <br/>
first accident Keith has had, though is it?&quot;    It wasn&#39;t an inevitable <br/>
accident at all, and the driver had not responded well to the police (who <br/>
were already behind her with lights on before &quot;the rocks were hit&quot;), and who <br/>
kept trying to start the car even though nothing was happening and its fluids <br/>
were all over the road.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing, how the blame was just swirled up into the wind.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Good writing will consist of almost<br/>
all active voice. It causes less confusion and is less wordy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always believed this too.<br/>
<br/>
But I think the point of the recommendation of passive voice here was <br/>
specifically to discourage people from being direct.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Passive voice, however, is used when blame needs to be shifted. &quot;The vase <br/>
was broken.&quot; It does not imply who broke it, so it sounds better when you <br/>
tell mommy that as opposed to &quot;I broke the vase.&quot; Passive voice uses mostly <br/>
the &quot;to be&quot; verbs --is, are, was, were, am etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s conditional with passive.  &quot;Were the vase to be broken, we might <br/>
think someone did it.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the sort of passive voice some would prefer to have used here.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like a woman taking a doll to the doctor 130 years ago and pointing <br/>
at the place where it hurts.  I think there is some desire to deflect talking <br/>
about real people and instances.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Were a child being taught using traditional methods and a curriculum, some <br/>
people might think that it might not be the best way to come to an <br/>
understanding of unschooling.&quot;<br/>

gotten lost in cyberspace along with several other things I&#39;ve sent.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t recommend that anyone switch to passive voice.  What I sent <br/>
was a post about a conversation had elsewhere about how <br/>
passive/active voice can affect how people view our posts.  It has <br/>
helped me to at least understand how people can take offense at <br/>
something I thought was a perfectly innocuous comment when I wrote it. <br/>
 I thought the information could perhaps be of interest to others <br/>
here.<br/>

I just want to make it clear that I was not saying anyone should <br/>
change their grammar style from active to passive voice.  Heck, I <br/>
don&#39;t think I could with out a serious conscious effort!  <br/>
I just found the information very helpful, to me personally, in <br/>
understanding why sometimes what appears to be a perfectly innocuous <br/>
remark is taken as something negative.  I thought some others might be <br/>
interested.<br/>
