<div id="ygrps-yiv-558972178">I have an almost 5 yr old and a 1 yr old <br/>
and am wondering how the early years for you &quot;seasoned ;) <br/>
unschoolers&quot; have played out. . .<br/>
 I am at a crux (is this a word, did I make it up?) of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; sorts. Do you all have any fun stories to share with us with young <br/>
&gt; children on your unschooling led stories of the early years?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Hi Ticia - You feel you&#39;re at a crossing or intersection? I agree <br/>
&quot;crux&quot; captures what the early years were like with our two children.<br/>
<br/>
       As an older than average mom with a career behind me, just having <br/>
babies and being home with them was heaven. <br/>
<br/>
      But our new family were confronted with crisis after crisis. We lost my <br/>
own mom and dad plus DH&#39;s dad. DH fell off the roof during a storm and took <br/>
months to recover while I cared for both him and our toddler, with no family <br/>
members to help.  I had emergency surgery that separated me as a nursing mom <br/>
from the new baby. The next year, when that baby was 13 months old and I had my <br/>
back turned with laundry, he managed to open the porch door. Less than one <br/>
minute later, he was facedown in the swimming pool. We somehow survived that with <br/>
no permanent damage. Then on a Sunday afternoon outing, all four of us were <br/>
blindsided by a teen driver who totaled our minivan and wrecked our peace of <br/>
mind, too. <br/>
<br/>
         Maybe &quot;crisis&quot; comes from the same root as &quot;crossing&quot; and &quot;crux?&quot; I <br/>
should go look that up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       None of it could be blamed on anyone -- least of all the children, who <br/>
by comparison seemed almost miraculously perfect to me in every way, no <br/>
matter what they did or didn&#39;t do, or when they did or didn&#39;t do it. <br/>
<br/>
       I just loved being with them, in a moment-to-moment kind of way that <br/>
was completely out of character for me in Life Before Parenthood. I am a <br/>
professional educator, but I sure wasn&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; or controlling their learning, <br/>
much less their development. I felt like we were lucky we were all still alive <br/>
and together! DH and I just had so much to deal with and worry about, that we <br/>
didn&#39;t buy curriculum or do phonics or anything schooly, or obsess about <br/>
finding a preschool or other programs. <br/>
<br/>
       So those early years were un-schooled, not in name or by design or <br/>
intent. Yet both children were early self-taught readers, happy, curious, <br/>
competent, confident, kind. And still are. :)  <br/>
       <br/>
       I&#39;m grateful because they&#39;re so great, but also I suspect they&#39;re <br/>
great because I&#39;m so grateful for them. <br/>
<br/>
       Without all the crisis in their early years to distract my own <br/>
overdeveloped, task-oriented, first-born drive to achieve and control -- and to focus <br/>
me on pure appreciation of their existence -- I can&#39;t say whether we would <br/>
have discovered the unschooling lifestyle that turned out to be so right for us. <br/>
Somehow we stumbled on it in the crucible of burning away everything else. <br/>
(crucible -- from the same root as crux, I&#39;ll bet! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
