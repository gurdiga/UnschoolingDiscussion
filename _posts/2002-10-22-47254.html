Nothing serious. Certainly nothing needing hospitalization! But they are more <br/>

<br/>
I think there&#39;s *almost* a guarantee that if you&#39;re working in a kitchen, you <br/>
will eventually burn yourself and cut yourself. But if he&#39;s shown the right <br/>
way to hold knives (sharp knives are safer than dull) and what he&#39;s cutting <br/>
(keep fingerTIPS away from blades) and how to manuever around a hot stove, <br/>
the chances of serious injury will be diminished. <br/>
<br/>
A chair works better for us than a stool. We turn it backwards (or sideways, <br/>
depending on the height of the chair) so that he&#39;s standing facing the back <br/>
of the chair. That way he can BACK off the chair while holding onto the <br/>
chair-back and he can&#39;t fall FORWARD into the fire. It also gives him <br/>
something to lean into other than the stove itself. (If he&#39;s leaning into the <br/>
chair, the chair can&#39;t slip back---unlike leaning into a solid surface.)<br/>

LOL I know Brett is actually more careful than me around things that could hurt, he&#39;s the one who asked for us to put pillows under the tree before he climbed up it!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144368551">In the case of the oil, the wrong burner was turned on. The child decided to move the oil off the burner and just put what she wanted to cook on the burner, instead of turning it off and turning the right one on. The mom was in the kitchen with her at the time, said she just moved too fast. :-(<br/>

stove -- got one of those smooth ceramic cook stove ones. I notice NOW they<br/>

buttons at the front of the stove to watch to see if it is on or still hot. It<br/>
is pretty easy to set something on top of the heat indicators and forget about<br/>
them. Even I screw up with it sometimes and have tried to wipe down a hot<br/>
burner with a cloth etc. And, uh, the time I sat the garbage can lid on a hot<br/>
burner and it melted and I had to scrape it off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350976651">We have an older stove, with the knobs behind the burners.  The problem<br/>
is that a little person has to stretch and lean well over the burner to<br/>
turn it off.  Dylan does cook, at first with my help and now he makes<br/>
some things by himself.  Turning the burner on isn&#39;t a problem but<br/>
getting it turned off, while the burner is hot, is.  <br/>
He asks someone to turn it off for him, or he climbs on the counter and<br/>
approaches the knob from the side, where he won&#39;t have to reach and lean,<br/>
with his shirt, over the burner.  <br/>
I have asked that he not cook on the stove if I&#39;m asleep but he can use<br/>
the toaster oven or the microwave.<br/>
I still move heavy pans for him and dump hot liquids.  <br/>
I would love to get a new stove with knobs in the front.  <br/>
