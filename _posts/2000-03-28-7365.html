<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088567160">Unschooling that is....my dd is learning to read and loving it!  I pulled out <br/>
the Bob books yesterday and she thought they were great.  Today she got them <br/>
out herself and even asked if she could take her book to read in the car!!  <br/>
Oddly enough I had just been in an uncomfortable situation last week with <br/>
some dear friends when I started (internally) comparing my dd to my friends <br/>
children who could already read (they are relaxed hsers) and I was feeling <br/>
horrible!  So I went to my dd and told her we really needed to work on <br/>
reading and she burst out crying (horrible I know, and goes against <br/>
everything that I believe in, I just had a weak moment!!).  Anyhow, good came <br/>
out of it.  Once I understood her fear (she thought she should just &quot;get it&quot; <br/>
and instantly start reading her library books) I was able to explain to her <br/>
how most people learn to read (slowly, short words , practice and as always <br/>
at her own pace).  Once she understood that it was ok not to know all the <br/>
answers or sounds in this case she was fine. I didnt&#39; mention it again for a <br/>
couple of days.  Went to the unschooling.com site, read a great thread on <br/>
reading under Sandra Dodds folder and felt even better.  Yeserday I pulled <br/>
out the Bob books and as they say, the rest is history. ; )<br/>

Where did you find the reading essay?&nbsp; I looked, but can&#39;t find it.&nbsp;
What do you mean by the Sandra Dodd folder?
