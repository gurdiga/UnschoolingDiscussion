    Robin,<br>&gt; Just curious, if you&#39;re vegetarian how come you go to the 
    aquarium?&nbsp; We&#39;re<br>vegan for the animals sake and for us caging 
    animals is another injustice.<br>&gt; Collette<br><br><br>Hmmm, that&#39;s a 
    very thought-provoking question and has a couple of different<br>facets to 
    it. We&#39;re vegetarians for many different reasons. I guess the<br>first and 
    foremost would be for the earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br>energy, 
    chemicals, land abuse, etc. needed to sustain production of meat<br>animals 
    is horrific on the environment. Secondly would be health reasons, we<br>eat 
    organic produce or stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t want to be 
    putting<br>meat into our bodies that has hormones, fertilizers, pesticides, 
    etc. in it,<br>and also I feel that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to my body on 
    a cellular<br>level (I&#39;ve been a veggie for going on 20 years now, it was 
    when I started<br>exercising and came to a better awareness of my body that 
    I first felt how<br>wrong it felt for my own body to eat meat). Thirdly 
    would be animal-loving<br>reasons as the way most meat animals are raised 
    and slaughtered is pretty<br>inhumane. But I&#39;m not totally against eating 
    meat for this reason - if it<br>was like my ancestors where it was myself, a 
    deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br>likely shoot the deer. After all, the 
    mountain lion would be doing the same<br>thing, nature is in itself fairly 
    cruel to animals across the board. But<br>modern methods go above and beyond 
    in the cruelty department and so I don&#39;t<br>like to support 
    them.<br><br>That brings us to the aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve gone back 
    and forth on<br>for many years. Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild animal 
    parks, or not? On one<br>hand, they are keeping animals in cages which feels 
    wrong to me. On the<br>other hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a long 
    way since the day of the<br>bear in the concrete cage staring out through 
    the bars. Nowadays most zoos<br>are into wildlife research, reproduction, 
    animal-trading with other zoos to<br>breed species whose decline in the wild 
    is bordering on extinction, etc. And<br>they also play a big role in 
    educating the public about the dangers to our<br>earth&#39;s wild areas. So does 
    the good they do balance out the bad? Or does<br>the bad of keeping wild 
    animals caged outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br>the whole species? 
    Would panda bears be extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br>magical they 
    are up close and therefore send money, time, and energy to<br>organizations 
    to keep their remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br>Aquarium, where we 
    went, has some measure of fame because of their efforts<br>to rehabilitate 
    Keiko (the orca from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br>wild. Is 
    supporting this a good thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br>and to 
    the zoo. We don&#39;t go to the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br>have 
    any redeeming qualities, the animals are only there for entertainment<br>and 
    no research or educational benefit is present.<br><br>A long-winded reply to 
    a question that for me doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br>answer.<br><br>Blue

<div><font color="#008080"><strong>I have taken my children to zoos, but research 
the ethics behind the institution before letting them get a hold of my 
money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are now making life as &quot;normal&quot; as possible for animals, 
with enclosures made to keep them happy and lower the stress in their 
lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Breeding programs in some zoos has helped save some species 
from extinction and that can&#39;t be bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall seeing the gorillas 
in The Melbourne Zoo, well catching a glimpse of them anyway, their enclosure 
gives them control over whether or not they are visible to humans.&nbsp; The 
orangutans on the other hand seem rather gregarious and enjoy watching people as 
much as the people enjoy watching&nbsp;them.&nbsp;&nbsp; One in particular would 
imitate&nbsp;the faces you were pulling&nbsp;at 
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></div>

horror,&nbsp;tigers pacing in small cages, nothing but prisoners and very 
obviously suffering from their captivity, then I think of

keep the animals&nbsp;occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></strong>&nbsp;</div>

      From: &quot;Collette Mattingly&quot; &lt;collettemattingly@...&gt;<br>&gt; 
      Robin,<br>&gt; Just curious, if you&#39;re vegetarian how come you go to the 
      aquarium?&nbsp; We&#39;re<br>vegan for the animals sake and for us caging 
      animals is another injustice.<br>&gt; Collette<br><br><br>Hmmm, that&#39;s a 
      very thought-provoking question and has a couple of different<br>facets to 
      it. We&#39;re vegetarians for many different reasons. I guess the<br>first and 
      foremost would be for the earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br>energy, 
      chemicals, land abuse, etc. needed to sustain production of 
      meat<br>animals is horrific on the environment. Secondly would be health 
      reasons, we<br>eat organic produce or stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t 
      want to be putting<br>meat into our bodies that has hormones, fertilizers, 
      pesticides, etc. in it,<br>and also I feel that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; 
      to my body on a cellular<br>level (I&#39;ve been a veggie for going on 20 
      years now, it was when I started<br>exercising and came to a better 
      awareness of my body that I first felt how<br>wrong it felt for my own 
      body to eat meat). Thirdly would be animal-loving<br>reasons as the way 
      most meat animals are raised and slaughtered is pretty<br>inhumane. But 
      I&#39;m not totally against eating meat for this reason - if it<br>was like my 
      ancestors where it was myself, a deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br>likely 
      shoot the deer. After all, the mountain lion would be doing the 
      same<br>thing, nature is in itself fairly cruel to animals across the 
      board. But<br>modern methods go above and beyond in the cruelty department 
      and so I don&#39;t<br>like to support them.<br><br>That brings us to the 
      aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve gone back and forth on<br>for many years. 
      Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild animal parks, or not? On one<br>hand, they 
      are keeping animals in cages which feels wrong to me. On the<br>other 
      hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a long way since the day of 
      the<br>bear in the concrete cage staring out through the bars. Nowadays 
      most zoos<br>are into wildlife research, reproduction, animal-trading with 
      other zoos to<br>breed species whose decline in the wild is bordering on 
      extinction, etc. And<br>they also play a big role in educating the public 
      about the dangers to our<br>earth&#39;s wild areas. So does the good they do 
      balance out the bad? Or does<br>the bad of keeping wild animals caged 
      outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br>the whole species? Would panda 
      bears be extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br>magical they are up close 
      and therefore send money, time, and energy to<br>organizations to keep 
      their remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br>Aquarium, where we went, 
      has some measure of fame because of their efforts<br>to rehabilitate Keiko 
      (the orca from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br>wild. Is supporting 
      this a good thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br>and to the zoo. 
      We don&#39;t go to the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br>have any 
      redeeming qualities, the animals are only there for entertainment<br>and 
      no research or educational benefit is present.<br><br>A long-winded reply 
      to a question that for me doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br>answer.<br><br>Blue
