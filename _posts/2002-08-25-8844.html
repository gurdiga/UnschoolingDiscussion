the book, it&#39;s so much funnier. My son hasn&#39;t read it yet but both my <br/>

hysterically funny even in print.<br/>

The author of the true story is Betty MacDonald and she&#39;s written other<br/>
very funny books.  <br/>
<br/>
She wrote one about the year she spent dealing with tuberculosis and she<br/>
called it &quot;The Plague and I.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is also &quot;Anybody Can Do Anything&quot;  and &quot;Onions in the Stew&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Cool that you live there!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember liking that as a kid! :-) I liked the movie as a kid too, though<br/>
I probably saw the movie first and lots of the Ma and Pa Kettle sequels.<br/>
<br/>
Someone a couple of years ago said they read The Egg and I as an adult and<br/>
was shocked by the racism in it. I don&#39;t recall noticing any -- not that I<br/>
remember more about the book other than it was funny and I liked it! -- but<br/>
I didn&#39;t remember any in the old Nancy Drews either and am uncomfortably<br/>
aware of the few references now reading them aloud to Kathryn. Someone also<br/>
mentioned the Bobbsy Twins and Rhubarb (an adult book about a cat who owned<br/>
a baseball team that was also made into a movie) had racist attitudes too.<br/>
Anyone read these as adults?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I expect it&#39;s there, though like you I don&#39;t recall the specifics. <br/>
That&#39;s horrible in itself.<br/>
There was a book of short stories my husband read as a kid and wanted to<br/>
read to Dylan.  I don&#39;t recall the author, but when David found it and<br/>
began reading it was too uncomfortable for him, for that very reason.<br/>
<br/>
I notice how much more sensitive my son is to racist and sexist comments<br/>
than I was as a child.   I have often been frustrated at his grandparents<br/>
for their comments, my mother cannot open her mouth without mentioning<br/>
how &quot;different&quot; or &quot;stubborn&quot; or &quot;impatient&quot; men are.   <br/>
<br/>
In one particularly horrible moment, when my mil was here and her friend<br/>
and my mom and aunt, and everyone was talking about something offensive,<br/>
which I cannot recall the details of now... I asked them to please change<br/>
the subject several time and when they would not I roared at all of them<br/>
to leave.  Not my finest hour, my son will remember my hysteria long<br/>
after he&#39;s forgotten the topic.  But all I could think was that their<br/>
poison was going directly into his head.  <br/>
<br/>
Awful.  We moved here deliberately to help these older folks and I find<br/>
myself wishing we were instead many miles away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just opened up the Egg and I to read a bit. I&#39;d sort of forgotten <br/>
that element of the book. It&#39;s there. It has to do with the Native <br/>
Americans she came in contact with. It&#39;s too bad. The book is still <br/>
really funny but that part of it is pretty shocking to modern <br/>
sensibilities. I don&#39;t doubt that if she were writing the book now <br/>
instead of in the forties it would be written differently, but it&#39;s a <br/>
product of the times she wrote it in. I&#39;d still recommend the book <br/>
but that element would need to be discussed with your kids if read <br/>
with them.<br/>

had lots of conversations about what people believed then as opposed to <br/>
what people believe now.<br/>
