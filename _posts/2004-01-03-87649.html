<div id="ygrps-yiv-719248016">Typically, we sleep in in the mornings and head to bed late, around 2230 to 2300. We started giving Sarah a &quot;bedtime&quot; when she started school, and we&#39;ve kept that up thinking that if we didn&#39;t, she was more likely to act wild the next day. She doesn&#39;t necessarily have to go to sleep anymore since she&#39;s not getting up for school...but I was really beginning to feel like this was un-necessary to continue. <br/>
 <br/>
While I haven&#39;t said &quot;Sarah you&#39;re not going to have a bedtime anymore&quot; yet because I know Paul will still want to &quot;send her to bed&quot; at 2130, as far as I&#39;m concerned when he isn&#39;t home and I am, then we&#39;ll do things my way. <br/>
 <br/>
So last night, Sarah said she wanted to stay up all night. I said &quot;Oh, really? Go right ahead.&quot; Logan wanted to stay up as well. He ended up in his bedroom about 2300, and I went to check on him. He was playing with his cars, so I asked if I could play too. We had a good time for about twenty minutes, making up stories and buzzing our lips to make car sounds. <br/>
 <br/>
Then he asked to play his Thomas computer game. So I let him. Since Gracie was asleep on my bed, I went and laid down on the twin bed in the Littles&#39; room that nobody actually uses as a bed. I read for awhile, then Sarah came and said Logan was off the computer and had fallen asleep on the couch with Megan. <br/>
 <br/>
I told Sarah I was headed to bed, and I asked her to keep things quiet. About 0200 I had to ask her to turn off the TV because she kept turning the volume up loud enough for me to hear it, which was disturbing my rest. She said &quot;Ok, I&#39;m kinda tired anyway&quot; and she slept on the recliner with a blanket. Logan and Megan looked pretty darn cute all curled around each other like puppies. <br/>
 <br/>
Gracie woke up about 0830, and then I heard Megan about 10:00 and Logan and Sarah just a couple minutes after. It was nice..I laid in my bed listening and heard Megan saying &quot;Buh-EEEE!!! Way up!!! Sisssssiiiee!! WAY UP!&quot; as she tried to wake them up. <br/>
 <br/>
Everyone woke up cheerfully, and so far this morning nobody&#39;s acting wild. <br/>
 <br/>
I think we&#39;ll continue this.<br/>
