<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881731733">I don&#39;t remember who brought it up, but I have to disagree with the <br/>
assertion that swimming shouldn&#39;t be unschooled.  Matter of fact, that was <br/>
one of the first experiences that convinced me that the unschooling thing <br/>
could work!  We own a pool, and are worried about drowning.  My wife tried <br/>
to take our daughter, Serena, to swimming lessons, and Serena did NOT like <br/>
them.  She always wanted to do her own thing, not what the teacher wanted! <br/>
 So, instead of formal swimming lessons, we just took her into the pool. <br/>
Our pool has a large shallow end, about 3 feet deep.  She would play on <br/>
the steps, and when she wanted, would come out to one of us.  She worked <br/>
her way up to that, and then, worked her way into standing by herself, and <br/>
then to swimming in the shallow end, and finally, to swimming in the deep <br/>
end.  She did have a suit that had floatation cushions sewn in it when she <br/>
was younger, but once she started standing in the shallow end, she didn&#39;t <br/>
wear that anymore, and has never really used those wings or anything like <br/>
that.  Sometimes, she sees other kids using them, and she claims that she <br/>
can&#39;t swim, and that she needs them!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I notice about her, versus kids that have taken swim lessons, is <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t limit herself artificially.  One of her friends doesn&#39;t <br/>
dive to the bottom because &quot;her teacher hasn&#39;t shown her that yet&quot;,  while <br/>
Serena happily swims on the bottom!<br/>

unschooled, just that I personally wasn&#39;t choosing to unschool it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For some kids, maybe. Tried it with my kid and it didn&#39;t work. My son <br/>
didn&#39;t go in the water, even with all the flotation devices and cool <br/>
toys we bought, until he was 4 1/2 and started swimming lessons. Our <br/>
whole family would go to the pool and he would sit on the side. We <br/>
spent entire vacations in Hawaii and Florida with him not going in <br/>
the pool. Swimming lessons freed him to swim, and now he is an <br/>
amazing little fish. Dives to the bottom (taught himself that one, <br/>
too!). For a kid with SID (sensory integration dysfunction), that <br/>
made him very averse to the water to start with, to a kid who can not <br/>
only get his face wet but submerge himself totally, we&#39;ve been pretty <br/>
amazed at the progress he&#39;s made with a good teacher. Progress he <br/>
absolutely wasn&#39;t about to attempt on his own.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a different situation. My kids both love swimming <br/>
lessons, and they&#39;ve had a great teacher. Recently, when my son said <br/>
he didn&#39;t want to do them anymore, I respected that and he quit, mid-<br/>
session.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s great. I wish we could have a pool of our own, might <br/>
make it a bit easier to unschool something like that. As it was, we <br/>
were paying to go the pool every week to have our son sit on the <br/>
side, for many years. For us, this was the one scenario where <br/>
unschooling the subject wasn&#39;t &quot;working&quot;. And the obvious reason it <br/>
wasn&#39;t working was that our kid wasn&#39;t going to go into the water in <br/>
the timeframe that I wanted him to. Like I said, if I&#39;d been patient, <br/>
maybe he would&#39;ve done it at 6 or 8 or 10 years old. That&#39;s the <br/>
unschooling philosophy - that patience. But if you ask me, <br/>
unschooling only works if you&#39;re willing to have that patience, and I <br/>
wasn&#39;t willing to WRT something I consider a safety issue. And I&#39;m <br/>
glad we were able to find a teacher who could gently encourage him to <br/>
give the water a try. Now he begs to go swimming!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s just a hallmark of non-unschooled kids in general. As my <br/>
kids are unschooled in every other aspect of learning, they have no <br/>
problems doing things that they haven&#39;t been taught. They tend to see <br/>
their swimming teacher as a jumping-off point, so to speak. Since <br/>
beginning lessons, my son has taught himself to swim underwater, <br/>
taught himself to jump and dive in from the edge too. It&#39;s funny, <br/>
because she gives these little report card thingies that tells what <br/>
he&#39;s able to do, and I told her he could do half the stuff that she <br/>
didn&#39;t check off. She was surprised. And of course, that was just <br/>
before he asked to quit. I think he realized he&#39;d outlived the <br/>
usefulness of having her as a teacher. <br/>
<br/>
With my daughter, I wouldn&#39;t have started her in lessons for another <br/>
year or two, but she begged for them when her older brother started <br/>
going. Now that he quit, she still says she wants to go. I guess that <br/>
part of it is unschooling after all. She&#39;s much more the type to just <br/>
want to get in the water and swim, so I don&#39;t really worry about her <br/>
learning it at all. We had to get her a floatie as a 1 year old, <br/>
because she would toddle up to the edge of the pool and just fling <br/>
herself in! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to reiterate that I don&#39;t see any reason why anyone *has to* <br/>
unschool swimming. My comment was just that I *chose* to based on the <br/>
fact that my son did not seem to be naturally coming to it on his <br/>
own, and it was important enough to me to subvert his natural <br/>
timeline and have him learn it via lessons. <br/>
<br/>
As a personal swimming coach (mostly for triathlons), I have taught <br/>
adult swimmers who have never learned to swim as children. Quite <br/>
often, I have to start at the point of having them put their face in <br/>
the water and blow bubbles, or deal with panic attacks at the very <br/>
thought of water. Swimming is one of the things that very few people <br/>
learn to do well as children. Even people who &quot;know how to swim&quot; are <br/>
not strong enough swimmers to avert a catastrophe if they fell in a <br/>
river or into the middle of a lake, especially with clothing on. This <br/>
is one area that I wanted to make sure my kids picked up, for their <br/>
own safety. I&#39;ve rescued both kids and adults from near-drowning <br/>
situations. <br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean I think it&#39;s mandatory for all unschoolers, <br/>
that&#39;s just the way i chose to do it for my kids.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because she would toddle up to the edge of the pool and just fling <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Robin, I&#39;m with you. I taught all my kids to swim my own self, except <br/>
my youngest. She HAD a floatie...and one day, two days before her <br/>
third birthday, in a crowded pool, when I thought my hubby had her, <br/>
and he thought I had her, she took her floatie off and flung herself <br/>
into the water.<br/>
<br/>
The lifeguard did see her, floating face down, and he did get to her <br/>
in time THANK GOD. *shudder* worst day of my life. It took three <br/>
breaths to get her breathing again. And about 45 minutes for her toes <br/>
to return to normal color. When I saw her lying on the pool deck, her <br/>
toes were blue. My knees buckled and I went down. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s great now, and has no fear of the water, and is a terrific <br/>
swimmer, but we did hire a teacher for her, because it was flat out <br/>
TIME. Everyone but Katie DID start out in the 3ft. section, gradually <br/>
working their way up to deeper water. Katie in her fearlessness pert <br/>
near drowned herself, and we bought her some lessons.<br/>
<br/>
some things, you want handled in your own time frame.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

little, and water safety was always very much emphasized around our <br/>
house. <br/>
<br/>
And Heidi, I have to mention that I get a smile every time I see your <br/>
email name, it&#39;s too funny! <br/>
