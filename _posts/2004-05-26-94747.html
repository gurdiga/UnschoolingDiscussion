<div id="ygrps-yiv-524925510">Anyone know a good resource for IDing animal droppings, online or <br/>
otherwise?  Something has been pooping in our garden ... LOTS.  Not <br/>
touching the new plants, just pooping.  And pooping.  The kids love <br/>
the garden, and we&#39;re supposed to plant their whenever the rain <br/>
stops.  We&#39;ve tried watching for the animals but can&#39;t see them.... <br/>
did a google search and came out empty.  They&#39;re like rabbit <br/>
droppings but larger; we&#39;ve ruled out a porcupine I think, and I <br/>
think we&#39;d notice deer and they&#39;d much the plants besides.  We&#39;re in <br/>
a trailer park, not much wildlife here ... maybe skunks?  They&#39;ve <br/>
never pooped in the garden before but I put down llama manure this <br/>
year and cedar mulch in the paths, maybe one is drawing them?  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thought IDing it would be fun to do with the kids then we <br/>
can clean up all the poop and solve the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150001739">You don&#39;t have any renegade goats or sheep around do you?  Their poo looks <br/>
almost identical to deer, but if it&#39;s a small goat it would be much smaller.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids love the &quot;Crinkleroot&quot; books at the library.  There might be <br/>
something in one of them about identifying with droppings.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679352475">LOL -- I wish!  We live in a trailer park; even deer would be pretty <br/>
far-fetched here.  The biggest problem is that I&#39;m one of the only <br/>
ones who doesn&#39;t use chemicals in their yard and the only one who <br/>
grows veggies.  But I appreciate the suggestion! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788895449">There are books in the library that show  and identify animal droppings; both Junior and adult  sections.<br/>
 I am always checking out animal sign-tracks,droppings, holes under rocks,deadfalls,hair caught on the fences. Lots of bear,deer,elk,coyote,wolf etc. m around us plus the smaller  ones.<br/>
My husband doesnt share &quot;all&quot; of my interests-especially if I am using a stick to see what they have been eating.<br/>
So..how do you tell the difference between the droppings of a black bear and a grizzly?<br/>
Well a black bear has berries,seeds, pieces of hair.... . the grizzly has that plus a few other items-you know.....bear bells, belt buckles,  crushed bear spray cans...the usual.. LOL<br/>
Not sure where you are...sounds like deer-they can be pretty secretive even when right in front of your house-often just when it barely gets light and when it is almost black dark.<br/>
 Well except here where any old time is fine-they just check if the doberman is in the front yard..<br/>
Ground squirrels? <br/>
