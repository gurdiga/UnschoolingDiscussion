<div id="ygrps-yiv-332294685">My name is Lhiza...I currently live in Washington state...but I am a <br/>
traveling nurse...so I travel around the US working in different <br/>
hospitals...My family is in Az and I want to go back there when my oldest is <br/>
16...I decided to travel when I realised that me and the boys could see the <br/>
united states and I can still get paid for it...so far it is turning out to <br/>
be an awesome educational experience...<br/>
<br/>
For question 1.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how I am tied into every other homeschooler...except that I feel <br/>
very strongly about my beleifs that me to choose homeschooling and <br/>
subsequently unschooling.  It seems that from all the strong voices I see in <br/>
these posts...everyone here on this list also feel strongly about what brings <br/>
them to thier choices.  Being a single parent and having to have a full time <br/>
job...they spend enough time away from me as it is...I don&#39;t want to send <br/>
them to PS for another 8 hours.  I also feel that the ps system is breaking <br/>
down...to many parents trust that system to take care of their kids and <br/>
teachers are not paid enough to go thru what they have to with on a daily <br/>
basis in ps classrooms...So I am jealous of thier time away from me, I don&#39;t <br/>
trust the environment provided in ps&#39;s, I don&#39;t trust a culture where their <br/>
role models are not adults but other kids...I don&#39;t like the whole-gotta be <br/>
popular or fit into a group mentality that ps breeds in the kids...I really <br/>
believe that their education is my responsibility...and I feel I know more <br/>
about who they are now than I did before I took them out of ps...I can go on <br/>
and on...for us we are living a wonderful adventure filled life that I don&#39;t <br/>
allow the ills of society to intrude.  They will have plenty of time to deal <br/>
with those ills when they grow up...now is my time with them...<br/>
<br/>
For Question 2...<br/>
90% of my discipline is what I call...on the wall...when they get out of <br/>
line...(and this is anywhere we happen to be when they get out of <br/>
line)...they have to stand on the wall...sort of like in a corner...but they <br/>
have to keep their hands raised above thier heads...sort of like time-out in <br/>
that they are only &#39;on the wall&#39; for the minutes that equal their number of <br/>
years...once they have spent a minute or so on the wall...I start talking to <br/>
them about what put them on the wall...and they usually end up off the wall <br/>
as soon as they have verbalized why they ended up there and how they can stay <br/>
&#39;off the wall&#39;...my sister always trys to say...You have to be on the wall <br/>
for 30 minutes and she doesn&#39;t talk to them...so they end up uncomfortable <br/>
for that long and it is more like punishment...I don&#39;t put a time on it...I <br/>
depend on more if they can learn how to keep off the wall...if they need <br/>
quiet time...I give them an activity to do...if they are really grumpy and <br/>
have a hard time getting along...then we all take a break...maybe take a <br/>
nap...read a book...usually something relaxing...maybe watch some tv...if <br/>
they are rowdy...then we leave the house...they probably have cabin fever...I <br/>
have rules and expectations...they get fired if they blow off their chores <br/>
and have to earn thier allowance back...etc etc...it works for us...there is <br/>
alot of respect between the three of us...I have no problems telling them <br/>
what I need from them and they have no problems helping me out...<br/>
<br/>
Question 4<br/>
We sought out 4H...and one of my best friends...Carrie...also homeschools her <br/>
three kids and was homeschooled...so she is a great support...I am hoping <br/>
that as we travel the US...we will get to meet many different hs&#39;ers and <br/>
uns&#39;ers...and I am working on getting involved with church...that is the <br/>
hardest cuz I am very eclectic in my spirituality...Christians only want to <br/>
know about my experience with Jesus and pagans only want to know what <br/>
magickal tradition I follow...I feel that all paths have something important <br/>
to teach and I don&#39;t want to be closed to any particular one...<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for anyone else...but my goals is to teach my kids that as a <br/>
family...we are a team...and we are connected...I hope that they will move <br/>
into adulthood with a sense that they have a responsibility to help our world <br/>
change and grow...and mostly I want us to have fun and a zest for life...it <br/>
seems that too many kids are unhappy with their lot...I hope that our family <br/>
structure keeps unhappiness at bay...<br/>
