Ned&#39;s posts are interesting to me until there is a slew of replys ranting <br/>
about how they should stop which, frankly, I am not interested in hearing. It <br/>
is just making for too much mail.  I can figure out for myself that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t much care whether he insults people or makes questionable claims.  I <br/>
am not going to sit here and go over the whole thing but I do wish either :<br/>
1. Unsubscribe Ned    or <br/>
2. Let Ned say what he has to say without the ongoing crisis over it. <br/>

Either way Helen you have been/ are walking a fine line trying to do the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; thing and undoubtedly will feel badly no matter what happens. You <br/>
have been put in a touchy position.   I am glad it is not my decision.  <br/>
Whatever you  decide, I just wanted you to know I think people (even newbies, <br/>
speaking only for myself) can figure out for themselves how to take the posts <br/>
and choose to read or delete them, or even be insulted by them.  I do not <br/>
mind choosing .  I think  people who are unschooling or interested in it have <br/>
a certain kind of constitution  about freedom and want to hear many ideas, <br/>
but I also see the other side of the coin where one must decide to make <br/>
changes in the list forum based on what they percieve as a deviation from <br/>
what was originally intended. As the list owner ultimately that is up to you. <br/>
  For what it is worth if things continue the way they are I think you will <br/>
surely lose more people.  I may or may not be one of them depending on <br/>
whether I can take the amount of mail.  I really enjoy the list.  Whatever <br/>
you decide is okay with me.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a list newbie who&#39;s been lurking for a few weeks and I agree<br/>
with the above, particularly #2.  There is a concept called<br/>
&quot;metadiscussion&quot;, i.e. talking about how people are talking.  I am on<br/>
many lists where there is a strict ban on metadiscussion, because<br/>
(as everyone here has seen) once people start criticizing the WAY<br/>
someone posted or the SUBJECT someone posted about rather than<br/>
discussing issues and topics, things generally devolve into acrimony<br/>
and name-calling.  Here is a sample of the metadiscussion policy from<br/>
one list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Posting styles are not up for discussion on [this list]. Keep in mind it <br/>
is not possible for any one person on the [x] list to post in a way which <br/>
takes into account everyone&#39;s feelings. It is not OK to challenge or <br/>
criticize someone else&#39;s posting style On List. If you feel offended by a <br/>
post someone sent to the list and you feel a need to let that person know <br/>
how offended you are, please do it Off List. If you are offended by the <br/>
&#39;tone&#39; of the list and you feel you must address this, please address it <br/>
off list with those who you feel are setting the overall &#39;tone&#39; you <br/>
perceive. It is not your job to moderate the [x] list.<br/>
<br/>
Please do not discuss which [listname] Posts or Topics are Off Topic for <br/>
the [x] List on the [x] List. If anyone wants to conduct an email <br/>
discussion of which Posts or Topics are suitable for [this list], how often <br/>
these Posts or Topics should come up, and the number of Posts that should <br/>
be assigned to a Topic in any given period of time, please take it to <br/>
private email. Please remember that not all Posts or Topics are going to <br/>
interest everyone on the [x] List. If you don&#39;t like a Post or Topic or if <br/>
you are not interested in a Post or Topic, or if you find the Post or Topic <br/>
distasteful, or if you believe the Post or Topic to be Off Topic, or if you <br/>
believe the Post or Topic is too boring, simply make it disappear with the <br/>
Delete Key. If you are sick and tired of reading Posts or topics which <br/>
appear to dominate the list, feel free to introduce a new Post containing a <br/>
New Topic. If the New Topic doesn&#39;t take off, feel free to keep introducing <br/>
New Topics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been skimming and deleting Ned&#39;s posts, because I&#39;m mostly less<br/>
than interested in what he&#39;s been writing about.  But I&#39;ve also been<br/>
using the delete key liberally on all the posts DISCUSSING Ned&#39;s<br/>
posts, because they&#39;re virtually content-free, at least as relates to<br/>
my reason for coming to this list.<br/>
<br/>
And here I am, metadiscussing.  ;)<br/>
