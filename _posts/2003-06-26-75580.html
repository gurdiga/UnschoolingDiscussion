<br/>
Dylan would like that.   <br/>
<br/>
He has a plunger collection and a kind of plunger obsession.   At the<br/>
hardware store he puts all the squishy parts onto the handles and sticks<br/>
them to the floor.   They must love us. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he stuck them to the walls going up stairs.  It looked like an<br/>
Indiana Jones adventure.  You had to weave and swerve to get upstairs<br/>
without touching any handles.   They don&#39;t stick long on walls though,<br/>
mostly. <br/>
<br/>
Very strange kid.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

magic trick several years ago. It was ADORABLE!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see whether it&#39;s still here and send it your way!<br/>
