<div id="ygrps-yiv-926860762">Thanks so much to everyone who came through with this answer to my question<br/>
about the book I loved as a child but couldn&#39;t remember. I just picked it<br/>
up from the library last night and this it it!!! How amazing... I will<br/>
never not ask a question of you again &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now another favorite was about a family of birds and a Thumbelina-type<br/>
character I think- beautiful illustrations- I can see a couple of them in<br/>
my head .... just kidding- I think that one&#39;s lost forever!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I doubt this is the book but I&#39;ll throw this title out, just in case. The <br/>
book I&#39;m thinking about is called *Twig* by Elizabeth Orton Jones. It&#39;s about <br/>
a little girl who shrinks down to Thumbelina size. She does make friends with <br/>
a pair of sparrows, but the birds don&#39;t feature prominently.  And the <br/>
illustrations aren&#39;t beautiful either, though I&#39;m fond of them....just <br/>
colored ink drawings. Even if it&#39;s not the book you&#39;re thinking of, it&#39;s <br/>
still a neat book :) <br/>

ps.I&#39;m the fortunate daughter of a long-time librarian who used to bring home <br/>
all the discarded copies of books she knew I loved so I proudly possess an <br/>
exceedingly battered copy of *Twig*  :) :)</div>
