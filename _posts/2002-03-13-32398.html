<div id="ygrps-yiv-559061344">On a typical day of learning, I am pursuing my interests as much as my<br/>
children are.  Structure comes when we get up, eat, straighten, and talk<br/>
about what each of us wants to do today.  Then we write it down to see<br/>
how everyone&#39;s plans coincide chronologically.  This works really well<br/>
for us.  Although this has less to do with school in terms of, &quot;Oh, I<br/>
want to learn about this subject and that subject today&quot;, and more to do<br/>
with it in terms of, (in my 14y.o.d.s.&#39;s ongoing quest for more<br/>
information or experience in the area of architectural engineering),&quot; I<br/>
want to go to the library&quot; (to read about ancient architectural styles),<br/>
&quot;then to the building supply store&quot; (to buy some wood for the dog house<br/>
he designed and is building), &quot;then I want to be home when dad gets home&quot;<br/>
(to work on remodeling his bedroom according to his design).  We do have<br/>
traditional learning materials, but they are not required, just available<br/>
for when they want to use them.  For now the oldest three want to use<br/>
their math books, but I have showed them how to not be enslaved to them<br/>
by not feeling forced to go from chapter to chapter.  I showed them how<br/>
to look through the table of contents or index, or to just read the<br/>
lesson-explanation and do a few problems.   After p.s., this is hard for<br/>
them to accept.  They seem to feel a need to do it like at school, even<br/>
though they are starting to understand why it isn&#39;t really necessary and<br/>
sort of a waste of time.  For the first time in his life, my oldest is<br/>
realizing that math is something he can understand, although he always<br/>
wants to know what it has to do with geometry, since that is his biggest<br/>
interest math-wise.  They really like the jokes we find on natural math<br/>
and gnarly math.  My 7 y.o.d.d. hates traditional math, but somehow is<br/>
learning all about it without any workbook and even without games, (which<br/>
we were playing, but she&#39;s decided not to).  She comes up with the most<br/>
amazing math facts, just from thinking and playing by herself.  And she<br/>
can count without going one, two, three, four.  She just glances at<br/>
something and can tell me how many of whatever are on it.  She plays a<br/>
lot with the calculator, too.  She&#39;s also teaching herself cursive, and<br/>
she loves to write letters, make cards and create books.  We&#39;ve only been<br/>
unschooling this year.  The kids also participate in wrestling,<br/>
basketball, skateboarding and youth group.  Usually one day a week we<br/>
watch a movie,go to the mall or swim.  Sundays we go to church and visit<br/>
the cousins.  They spend the night at friends a lot.  It is really a<br/>
great life!  Sometimes I have to pinch myself to believe that I have<br/>
stumbled on this great way of living.  A lot of the financial problems we<br/>
have are working out with time and ingenuity, too, which helps my<br/>
dream-like state.<br/>
