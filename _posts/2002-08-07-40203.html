&gt; Lots of that wood is sold by the linear foot, so the person who bought <br/>
&gt; it and had it cut didn&#39;t pay for the leftovers.  If you buy one that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &quot;by the piece&quot; you should take the whole thing home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tuck<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tuck......Nope... You would be suprised....They do.. The guys are always <br/>
floored, but alot don&#39;t take the scrap piece once it is cut I talk to the <br/>
guys back there .. I asked them why would they cut and and not take the left <br/>
over piece.....<br/>
They said...people just want to take their measured piece. <br/>
I aksed if they always leave good piece like that...he said yep.......they <br/>
don&#39;t know why people do it, but they do. They said they would not personally <br/>
do it, but people do and I guess they look at it as making another profit.<br/>
There was this 2x8 piece of 3/4 in strand board left in their bend.... I <br/>
asked the the guy why did they take the rest and he said tht he didn&#39;t know, <br/>
and I said this piece for a 4x8 piece is 6 bucks and he said I know and they <br/>
didn&#39;t want the rest.... Look at it this way.....the sold that piece for full <br/>
price and turned around and sold the left over at a discount. It&#39;s all about <br/>
money......They do not have to worry about throwing it out, they can make a <br/>
profit. <br/>
<br/>
YES they do pay FULL price for  item, they do not charge them for a partial <br/>
piece or half of that item.... Menards does not do that either..... That is <br/>
the policy of the Menards and Home Depot here...<br/>
Example.........if a piece is $6 and you want half of that piece.....you will <br/>
pay the six dollars or if you buy a 4x8 of paneling and you want just a 2x8 <br/>
piece, you still have to pay for the 4x8 regardless.<br/>
ALL the home depots here are like that here so that&#39;s why I always take my <br/>
scrap with me....heck, I paid for it. That&#39;s the thing with these big home <br/>
improvement stores....<br/>
If you buy a piece, you pay for the price of that piece no matter if they cut <br/>
it or not. I wonder if they just leave it since cutting is free.......<br/>
<br/>
So, know I am going to collect pieces to build a sandbox when they leave the <br/>
pressure treated stuff.....<br/>
In fact there where 2 pieces of 4x4 that were 2 ft long that someone didn&#39;t <br/>
need or want when it was cut from a 8ft piece. I would have gotten it if I <br/>
had thought of something at that moment....both pieces were $.91 each!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Look how much of a waste society there is out there......<br/>
If they need just 6 ft of an 8 ft board....they will just take that and leave <br/>
the rest......even though they have to pay for the 8ft board.<br/>
So, companies are getting smart and making more of a profit.<br/>
So, if they have to be the ones that dispose of the scrap........why not make <br/>
an itsy bitsy profit out of it.....<br/>

<br/>
Here is a excerpt.....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rather, the kingdom is inside of you, and it is outside of you.  When you <br/>
come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize <br/>
that it is you who are the sons of the living father.  But if you will not <br/>
know yourselves, you dwell in poverty and it is you who are that poverty&quot; <br/>
(1). He wasn&#39;t talking about financial poverty here.  He was talking about <br/>
spiritual poverty, that comes from not realizing the spiritual nature of <br/>
existence. <br/>

Of course you&#39;re doing the right thing! You got a new doctor. Now you also<br/>
need a new &quot;best friend,&quot; a new place to live, new occupations, the works.<br/>
It&#39;s great how sometimes a little thing can trigger some big changes.<br/>

Gotta wonder what system turns out people like that....<br/>
