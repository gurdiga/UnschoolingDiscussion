adults who work with wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
We live right in the city of Chicago, so our exposure to animals is fairly<br/>
limited. Quinn is most interested in the most exotic wildlife: pandas,<br/>
platypuses, Saharan fennec foxes. There&#39;s only so much that can be done IRL.<br/>
I&#39;m contemplating getting cable just for Animal Planet (I DON&quot;T mean that&#39;s<br/>
all we&#39;ll watch - I just mean that alone might make it worth the money). I<br/>
think the zoos have intern opportunities for when the kids are older. Quinn<br/>
volunteers at an ecology center where they have a lot of domestic animals<br/>
that he takes care of, that helps some.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not much help, but all we can really do is keep our eyes peeled for<br/>
every animal opportunity that arises. Oh, yeah, and we&#39;re trying to save and<br/>
plan for a trip to Australia. Even the dream of that is satisfying in a<br/>
small way.<br/>
