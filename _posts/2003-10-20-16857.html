<div id="ygrps-yiv-515965078">I had something new to share with those in the know who could nod and<br/>
say &quot;exactly&quot; as well as for anyone who may be feeling a bit shaky or<br/>
new as yet... I know there are a couple of people here.  ;)  This just<br/>
goes to illustrate a point about how testing really tells you nothing<br/>
about someone&#39;s actual ability.  My husband recently had to take an NEC<br/>
exam (electrician stuff).  It was an open-book, timed, multiple-choice<br/>
deal-y.  Just for sh*ts and giggles, I took the practice test... Which<br/>
was rather lengthy, but I wanted to see what all the hubbub was.<br/>
Ladies... I aced it... I got them all right within the allotted time<br/>
limit.  So here I am qualified as a journeyman electrician, but anyone<br/>
who let me near their electrical work would be in big trouble.  I have<br/>
NO CLUE... <br/>
<br/>
I was telling my brother about it this weekend by phone, and<br/>
interestingly, his wife had done the same thing with his ASE exam (auto<br/>
mechanic).  She aced the test, but wouldn&#39;t be able to do any of the<br/>
actual work if it came up.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, when I worked as a web developer (for which I never went to<br/>
school, I was self taught) we hired a guy who had gone through one of<br/>
those 18 month certificate programs... Nice guy... But I had to teach<br/>
him from scratch... The very basics.  He learned, but had to admit, all<br/>
he knew after coming out of that program was how pass the tests to get<br/>
the certificate.  A year and a half of his life!  SO... There you go.<br/>

If a career as an electrician doesn&#39;t appeal to you, perhaps you could <br/>
rent yourself out as a professional test taker.  People need your skills <br/>
to survive in this crazy bureaucratic world we have created.<br/>

I have heard that there are some tests one can score badly on if one <br/>

would have expected - he&#39;s been doing this for a living for 20 <br/>
years.  A lot of it had to do with &quot;exceptions&quot; you mentioned and <br/>
other &quot;inane bull&quot; as he put it.  He doesn&#39;t test well...he can just <br/>
do the work.  The building inspectors love him though.  :)  Never a <br/>
problem.  Being able to do the work, unfortunately, doesn&#39;t count <br/>
for much with a lot of people.  It&#39;s all about the test.  pffft.  <br/>
They ought to test people for skilled work with actual hands-on work <br/>
I should think, not on paper.  Had we been competing for the same <br/>
job based on that fool test, I&#39;d have gotten it.  &quot;That don&#39;t make <br/>
no dang sense.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I should think, not on paper.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A long time ago, I knew how to use a word processing machine called a <br/>
Lexitron.  <br/>
It was a dedicated word processor (Like a really spiff version of Word, with <br/>
display screens the size and shape of a page, and this was late 70&#39;s, 1980ish.)<br/>
<br/>
I went to a placement agency to see what jobs they might have for me.  I said <br/>
I could use a Lexitron.  I had been doing typing and editing for an <br/>
archeology firm, doing government reports on what exciting sheepherder camp might have <br/>
once been on the place where they were putting in a parking lot, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
They said okay!  They could give me a Lexitron test.<br/>
<br/>
It was a piece of paper with ten questions.  I didn&#39;t do very well.  It asked <br/>
what key is used to center, and things like that.   I knew with my hands <br/>
without looking, but I didn&#39;t know if it was F7 or F8 or whatever, for purposes of <br/>
their paper.<br/>
<br/>
I knew it REALLY, not theoretically.  I had learned it by doing it.  I could <br/>
have entered his test text and formatted it exactly the way it was on that <br/>
page or better probably quicker than this guy could have READ it, but that was no <br/>
good, since he didn&#39;t have a Lexitron (nor had he ever heard of one).<br/>
<br/>
Same guy also advised me NOT to say I had been a teacher.  I asked what he <br/>
thought I should put in that six-year hole then?  He said I was young, and it <br/>
might be better to just let them assume I hadn&#39;t had a job yet than to say <br/>
&quot;teacher,&quot; because so many people didn&#39;t like teachers. <br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of that story for years and years, and have told it no more <br/>
than maybe three times since, because it was so profoundly frustratingly <br/>
profound. <br/>

I&#39;ve found this to be the norm when interviewing for jobs - the <br/>
people asking the questions don&#39;t know what they&#39;re asking.  If you <br/>
don&#39;t give the pat answer they want, they figure you don&#39;t know.  <br/>
I&#39;ve even gone so far as to try to explain to them what they were <br/>
asking so they could then understand how my answer - not exactly <br/>
what they had for a correct response on paper - was still correct.  <br/>
I only succeeded in confusing them and not getting the jobs.  And so <br/>
it goes... and goes.  When will it ever make any sense?<br/>

miserable years or more of their lives. And interviewers or employers <br/>
are often dealing with their children&#39;s teachers, too. Bleah!<br/>
