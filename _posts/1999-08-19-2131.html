&lt;&lt;  Siblings Without Rivalry   and  How to Talk So Your<br/>
 Child Will Listen And Listen So Your Child Will Talk  ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I have to support Susan&#39;s suggestions of these books!!!!  I highly recommend <br/>
them!  They helped us a lot to understand our children&#39;s frustrations with <br/>
each other better and help them to deal with each other.  How To Talk is very <br/>
informative also.<br/>
<br/>
Please run out and get these books from your library or local book store... <br/>
you won&#39;t be sorry and you might even be quite relieved!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think public school has too much to do with sibling rivalry and <br/>
quarreling.  it is more the fact the two or more very different personalities <br/>
are in close quarters together for an extended period of time ( mainly a <br/>
lifetime for them) and it can cause friction and problems mor often than not. <br/>
 We get into disagreements with our spouses and we don&#39;t always get along.  I <br/>
do feel this is simply because you are together for an extended period of <br/>
time... and you get on each others nerves!<br/>
<br/>
Some parents to do opt out of trying to help the children become better at <br/>
communicating their feelings in a more appropriate, less damaging way.  Some <br/>
parents chalk it up as normal.  We have never allowed our children to resort <br/>
to physical violence and their father and I have learned how to communicate <br/>
without demeaning and degrading each other.  So I believe it is possible for <br/>
our children to learn to communicate more effectively.  Harming another <br/>
person has always been where the line is drawn, verbally or physically.  <br/>
<br/>
Get the books though!  I have to go back to them time and again to &quot;get a <br/>
grip&quot; and get myself into a state of mind where &quot;I&quot; can deal with them and <br/>
their bickering.  I had to buy them because they get used time and again!<br/>
