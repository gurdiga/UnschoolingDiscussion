<div id="ygrps-yiv-725717755">This is the weirdest question I&#39;ve ever asked but if unschoolers don&#39;t know, <br/>
who will??<br/>
<br/>
I turned on the Tony King show on PBS this afternoon for just a bit, and he <br/>
was interviewing a guy who was talking about Caribbean music, but it was <br/>
winding down.  While it was all fascinating, I was left without much of the <br/>
gist of the conversation (was the guy a producer of recordings?  a folklorist <br/>
or musicologist?  I couldn&#39;t tell), and at the end Tony King thanked him but <br/>
didn&#39;t summarize or name him!  Ack!  I looked online some and didn&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone here saw that or knows, or has a PBS schedule that names <br/>
the guy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

My satellite guide says Eric Christian, music critic.  Could that be<br/>
right?  Sorry I don&#39;t have any more information.  ( Satellite Guide -<br/>
sounds like a cosmic spirit guide  )<br/>
<br/>
Regarding your other post - a little more on &quot; why unschooling...&quot;  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
