She has plans for Phase II.   There will be a shaved place up top, and <br/>
different side designs.  I always fear to execute her haircutting plans, but <br/>
they&#39;ve always turned out well.  This is the fifth and weirdest of the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628861349">OH!  That IS cute!  I&#39;ll have to show Haleigh.  I didn&#39;t realize Holly was <br/>
that young, it&#39;s nice to see a mother who allows her daughter such freedom <br/>
of expression at such a young age.  Such inspiration!  She looks much older, <br/>
as does my Haleigh.  Holly says she&#39;s interested in skating on her webpage.  <br/>
Skateboarding???  Haleigh is really into the skate/punk scene right now.  <br/>
(Hence the desire for black and pink hair.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing the pictures, I loved them!  You&#39;re right, she does pull <br/>
it off!  Now I&#39;m going to have to go get Tank Girl, so we can see *her* <br/>
hair!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, who LOVED Cyndi Lauper at that age, which reminds me, I haven&#39;t <br/>
listened to her in years, so I may be picking up some Cyndi Lauper alongside <br/>
Tank Girl! &gt;bg&lt;<br/>

I never did get a picture of Heather&#39;s dread-locks. Maybe I&#39;ll show her the pics and see if she wants designs now.<br/>
She&#39;s asked me to dye her hair but its so dark it needs bleaching first. Can I do it myself? I can&#39;t find a hair dresser that will bleacha childs hair. Grrrrrr.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Holly says she&#39;s interested in skating on her webpage.  <br/>
Skateboarding???   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ice skating mostly.   She always has roller blades (often her brother&#39;s <br/>
hand-me-downs) but she doesn&#39;t do tricks or skatepark.  But she likes to do <br/>
the ice rink when others will.  Marty (14) played ice hockey one year when he <br/>
was younger (8/9) and I really wanted him to do figure skating, but although <br/>
he took the whole course of skating lessons, he just likes to play, and <br/>
that&#39;s okay too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now I&#39;m going to have to go get Tank Girl, so we can see *her* hair!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WARNING!  WARNING!<br/>
Language/violence/suggestive this&#39;n&#39;that.<br/>
Also humor and merry sci-fi goofiness.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I haven&#39;t <br/>
listened to her in years, so I may be picking up some Cyndi Lauper alongside <br/>
Tank Girl! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because we subscribe to Netflix, I came upon a Cyndi Lauper DVD called <br/>
&quot;Twelve Deadly Cyns.&quot;  Videos with her commentary between.  VERY nicely done <br/>
and you can opt to have the lyrics showing.   Holly loved it so much that we <br/>
just bought a copy.<br/>
<br/>
We just bought Tank Girl for $11 at Hastings instead of renting it a FOURTH <br/>
time in two years. &lt;g&gt;  That was so cool.  I was happy it was so inexpensive. <br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I would never ever have thought it up on my own.  <br/>
<br/>
Years ago when her hair was about a foot long and she wanted a fancy haircut <br/>
for a wedding, the bravest thing I came up with was a spiral starting at a <br/>
side part, going from shaved to as long as it was long.  But that&#39;s not brave <br/>
or artsy.  That&#39;s just a bowl cut that follows a plain line til you run out <br/>
of hair.<br/>
<br/>
We had little pieces of paper with her sketches of ideas.  I was afraid to <br/>
start.  <br/>
<br/>
To help get it going, she got scissors and chopped two places an inch long.  <br/>
That was actually pretty smart, because at that point I was kind of &quot;fixing&quot; <br/>
instead of solely &quot;destroying&quot; her other haircut.<br/>
