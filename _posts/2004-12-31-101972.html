I&#39;m  still working on strewing without valuing the &quot;academic&quot; activity <br/>
more. To  me that&#39;s the ideal: to strew all sorts of math games, <br/>
books, games, toys  and outings without silently cheering for any <br/>
particular  choice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Silently cheering isn&#39;t so harmful.  It takes parents a long time to  get <br/>
over their own school pride/shame/attachment/fear.<br/>
 <br/>
I was kinda thrilled when Marty asked for the Romance of the Three  Kingdoms, <br/>
because it&#39;s historical (though it&#39;s a novel, it was written hundreds  of <br/>
years ago, in China) and it&#39;s not an easy read.   But I didn&#39;t say  those things <br/>
to Marty.  I got it out of my system by telling others.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989172161">I&#39;m not sure where this fits in, but someone mentioned taking <br/>
another kid (rather than your own)to go do the things you want to <br/>
do, if you dont want to go alone and your kid isnt interested.<br/>
<br/>
I had an interesting time this week. Seamus was away visiting his <br/>
dad, and i decided to spend some &quot;quality&quot; time with my niece who is <br/>
9 yo. I never spend time alone with her. She&#39;s at that age, <br/>
the &quot;cusp of womanhood&quot; &lt;g&gt; where spending time with her older aunts <br/>
makes her feel all grown up and &quot;in the loop&quot; (i have two sisters <br/>
and we are all very close.) <br/>
<br/>
I got to go to Borders and just hang out! I never get to do that <br/>
with seamus, he doesnt have the same book-worship thing i&#39;ve got. My <br/>
niece is TOTALLY into books (one of those kids that reads a book a <br/>
day, and spends hours in her room reading.) I even bought her a <br/>
couple books (she also had the gift card from my brother), and she <br/>
was sooo grateful like i&#39;d given her gold. We had fun reading the <br/>
back of book jackets out loud to one another, with feeling, which <br/>
apparently no one else does, because we got some strange looks!<br/>
<br/>
We then went to Pier One Import, which is another place i dont take <br/>
seamus (the saying &quot;Bull in a China Shop&quot; comes to mind)because he <br/>
hates going there and everything is so fragile...and we had so much <br/>
fun! looking at all the little pretty things i got her some <br/>
clearance xmas ornaments that were beaded and so pretty, and she was <br/>
sooo happy at having all this attention. I was happy at having <br/>
company who was pleased to do all this shopping with me without <br/>
asking all the time &quot;are we done yet?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We went to the pet store to look at the animals and buy cat treats, <br/>
and went to lunch. The previous day we went to see A Series of <br/>
Unfortunate Events (and to the bookstore too, no way would seamus <br/>
go to a bookstore with me two days in a row. In fact we went to <br/>
borders twice and waldenbooks, all within 24 hours!)Now i know who <br/>
i&#39;m taking when i have the desire to just go hang out and explore a <br/>
bookstore. In fact, i&#39;m thinking of planning a trip, just with my <br/>
niece, to the huge (warehouse sized)used bookstore in Detroit. I <br/>
think she&#39;d die...she&#39;s never seen such a thing. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, its nice to switch kids once and awhile!<br/>

None of my kids are really shoppers.  Holly gets tired of it before I  do, <br/>
always.  Luckily that&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t mind doing by myself  (thinking now of <br/>
thrift stores...).<br/>

Are all discussions purely for your enjoyment?  Sometimes it&#39;s  courteous to <br/>

someone who remembers the 60&#39;s, but when someone wasn&#39;t born  until the 80&#39;s, I <br/>
don&#39;t mind clarifying references, or naming one of the group&#39;s  songs to give <br/>
them a point of reference or something.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t start a discussion with my kid if I didn&#39;t think he would <br/>
enjoy it, unless I had a strong need for information from him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m considering the scenario when I&#39;m reading a book and finding an idea <br/>
or fact that I (at my advanced age) find interesting.  While I&#39;m doing <br/>
this, it&#39;s most likely that my son is watching TV or playing a computer <br/>
game.  Does he want to hear me say &quot;Here&#39;s an interesting anecdote.  <br/>
Apparently John Kerry has trouble deciding what to order in a <br/>
restaurant.  Maybe the flip-flopping rap wasn&#39;t as unfair as I <br/>
thought.&quot;  How about &quot;The proposed social security reforms look like <br/>
they are really going to shaft stay-at-home moms that end up <br/>
divorced.&quot;?  Or &quot;Thomas Jefferson really is my kind of guy.  I really <br/>
like this quote of his about his perception of Jesus.&quot;  Or &quot;This study <br/>
of media bias in the early Seventies had really screwy methodology.&quot;  <br/>
These are all things that I remember really lighting up my brain in the <br/>
last month that I did not think would be interesting to my ten year old kid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m already sleepy tonight, but tomorrow I can stick post-it notes in <br/>
the &quot;good parts&quot; of what I&#39;m reading and drop them into conversation <br/>
sometime when James seems to be in the mood to talk.  (Those of you that <br/>
have talkative, extraverted kids should imagine a different attitude at <br/>
my house. &lt;g&gt;)  And I can review them and prioritize them first so that <br/>
the seemingly dullest topics are at the bottom of the list.<br/>
<br/>
If I intentionally read books to myself about topics he was interested <br/>
in I might have more good conversations starters.  I suppose I would do <br/>
that if I was 20 years old and trying to impress a guy.  (Ahem, sad but <br/>
true.)  Does that seem like a reasonable tactic for enhancing unschooling?<br/>

Taken in the same spirit as watching the tv show they love with them once or<br/>
twice to understand what *they* like about it, even if you don&#39;t, I think it<br/>
sounds very Unschooling-enhancing. Of course, if it turns out to be so<br/>
soul-numbingly stultifying that you can hardly bear to turn the next page,<br/>
perhaps asking for a summary from the kid might be better. Hey there&#39;s an<br/>
idea - asking questions as conversation starters - depending on the kid&#39;s<br/>
personality of course.<br/>

There&#39;s something between accepting a chasm between you and  reading a book <br/>
about a topic he&#39;s interested in.  There are magazine  articles and webpages <br/>
you could read about things he&#39;s interested in, and show  him the good parts.  <br/>
Don&#39;t work it into the conversation in a weird way,  just say &quot;Hey, did you <br/>
already know this about Halo II?&quot; or whatever,  maybe.<br/>

Not if it seems stilted and false to you (like trying to impress a  guy).  <br/>
But what if you were 20 and had a boyfriend who loved hockey?   Between &quot;hockey <br/>
sucks&quot; and immersing yourself in all things hockey, there would  be a balance <br/>
point for you.<br/>

~~~<br/>
I happen to think that if you could find *nothing* in your life that was  <br/>
interesting to your son, then yeah, you should probably find something to read  <br/>
that you could discuss with him.<br/>
 <br/>
The other thing that struck me...and the John Kerry thing cracked me  <br/>
up...When you read something like that, take steps backwards from what lights  your <br/>
fire until you find something that will be relevant to your son.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I was a senior in high school, I got in a huge argument with my  history <br/>
teacher, during class.  I almost got suspended over it.  I sat  there and <br/>
argued how irrelevant whatever he was saying was to me.  This was  a particularly <br/>
stodgy old skinny-60s-tie history teacher.  But I could find  no relevance to <br/>
my life to what he was trying to tell us about.  His  only defense was that <br/>
&quot;someday&quot; history would mean more to me. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, he was right.  Certain history does mean something to me,  now.  What I <br/>
was trying to get him to see was that I needed to be able to  *apply* what he <br/>
was saying in order to understand and he was doing a piss-poor  job of <br/>
finding relevance to the life of an 17 yo girl in 1979.  <br/>
 <br/>
When Will and I talk about historical things, I try to relate it to  his <br/>
experience in some way.  Our house is 110 years old, which is  usually a good <br/>
reference point.  When he was younger, I used the year his  Poppy was born (1935) <br/>
or when I was born (1962) or when his big brother was born  (1982).  Sometimes <br/>
I say, &quot;When this house was brand new...&quot; and I  draw him a word picture <br/>
about what we&#39;re talking about.  In order to  draw that picture, I have to take <br/>
step backwards into what I know until I reach  what he knows (not always a <br/>
linear progression) and find that common  ground.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, he doesn&#39;t always see the common ground, or the steps of how I  <br/>
got from here to there.  But he&#39;s been exposed to something *beyond* what  he <br/>
know, and maybe he&#39;s put another hook on his model of the universe.   Only he <br/>
can tell you that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Will and I have had great fun being Lemony Snicket fans, and sharing other  <br/>
books together, and being interested in baseball together.  So, maybe just  <br/>
developing an interest together would be helpful, too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah!  A new mutual interest might be cool.<br/>
<br/>
There are hiking clubs, and various societies involving gardening and birds <br/>
and astronomy and history.   Bonuses:  Out of the house, new people, possible <br/>
connections to who other things not imagined before.<br/>
<br/>
I read aloud the best paragraph or two from an article in Smithsonian or <br/>
National Geographic sometimes.  Nobody else wants to read those in full, just me.  <br/>
Once, though, I read a little bit, and ended up reading the whole article <br/>
aloud to Keith and Marty.  It was about a big carbon dioxide burb a lake in <br/>
Africa makes once in a while, and it kills all the people an animals in the vally, <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t until this last time that anyone figured out what did it.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a common interest in death by carbon dioxide, but it was a <br/>
shared thing, and we have that knowledge in common now, and can connect other <br/>
things to it down the road.  It has at LEAST to do with people thinking their <br/>
actions caused normal earth-stuff.  No sense making sacrifices to a lake so it <br/>
won&#39;t kill you once you know that it wasn&#39;t a lake-god all cranky at something <br/>
you did or didn&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a little thing, but it was a real thing and not a &quot;kid&quot; thing, to <br/>
read that article.  There was no follow-up, no post-test, nothing but what it <br/>
was.    What it was, though, was one of very many similar moments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868419133">All this seems so contrived to me.  Maybe unschooling just came <br/>
easily for me so I don&#39;t understand how it can be &quot;enhanced&quot;.  I <br/>
learn; the kids learn.  I do; the kids do.  I share; the kids share.  <br/>
Sometimes we&#39;re together on this; sometimes we&#39;re not.  We all <br/>
discuss because it comes naturally.  I would never read a book as a <br/>
good conversation starter nor would I come up with questions to draw <br/>
them into a discussion before hand.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m also having a problem with strewing.  It seems to me <br/>
people are talking about strewing items to catch the interest of a <br/>
child so that they might learn something new.  If I bring home <br/>
anything that would interest a family member, whether it&#39;s something <br/>
they&#39;re interested in now or not, I tell them.  If I bring home items <br/>
I know they&#39;re not interested in but hope that they will be, that&#39;s <br/>
my issue.  I&#39;d feel I was being disrespectful and I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
surprised if my kids chose to have no interest in such an underhanded <br/>
affair.<br/>
<br/>
Materials in my house are strewn because we (all of us) are always in <br/>
the process of doing things.  Right now there&#39;s a screen printing kit <br/>
on the dining room table, JRR Tolkien quiz book on the end table, a <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think I&#39;m also having a problem with strewing.  It seems to me <br/>
<br/>
people are talking about strewing items to catch the interest of a <br/>
<br/>
child so that they might learn something new. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Or have fun, or be surprised, or have a conversation piece, or for them to <br/>
think of something altogether different to do with the thing/stuff/whatever.<br/>

<br/>
anything that would interest a family member, whether it&#39;s something <br/>

they&#39;re interested in now or not, I tell them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If I bring something for a particular person, I give it to her or him.<br/>
If I bring something cool into the house because it&#39;s a cool thing we didn&#39;t <br/>
have before, or something that hasn&#39;t been out for a while, I just put it out, <br/>
just as people have (kinda boringly) for years put magazines or &quot;coffeetable <br/>
books&quot; out (on coffeetables), or glass paperweights on end tables. <br/>
<br/>
-=- If I bring home items <br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;re not interested in but hope that they will be, that&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
my issue.  I&#39;d feel I was being disrespectful and I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
<br/>
surprised if my kids chose to have no interest in such an underhanded <br/>
<br/>
affair. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would something they&#39;re  not interested in be worth bringing home?  And <br/>
how do you know they&#39;re not interested in something before they see it?  <br/>
Someone who isn&#39;t interested in light physics as far as you know might have an hour <br/>
of fun with an air pig.  It&#39;s all about reflections and refractions, but who <br/>
cares?  We didn&#39;t use those words.  It&#39;s been on one table or another for <br/>
months, and ever guest who comes in plays with it.  At some point it will be packed <br/>
up, and at some other point(s) it will be brought back out, and someday one <br/>
of the kids will take it away to some other house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931166673">** When I was a senior in high school, I got in a huge argument with my  <br/>
history<br/>
teacher, during class.  I almost got suspended over it.  I sat  there and<br/>
argued how irrelevant whatever he was saying was to me.  This was  a <br/>
particularly<br/>
stodgy old skinny-60s-tie history teacher.  But I could find  no <br/>
relevance to<br/>
my life to what he was trying to tell us about.  His  only defense was that<br/>
&quot;someday&quot; history would mean more to me.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he was right.  Certain history does mean something to me,  now.  <br/>
What I<br/>
was trying to get him to see was that I needed to be able to  *apply* <br/>
what he<br/>
was saying in order to understand and he was doing a piss-poor  job of<br/>
finding relevance to the life of an 17 yo girl in 1979. **<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Tuck --<br/>
<br/>
I like your insight, and the image of you as a teenager.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s especially relevant to me, because my husband teaches 14 year <br/>
old students.  When he&#39;s planning lessons and sometimes bouncing ideas <br/>
off of me, he has an awareness that many of the students have their <br/>
deflector shields up and find most abstract stuff to be painfully <br/>
uninteresting.  Being unschooled, James is less closed to incoming <br/>
information, but I may get stuck with the selection &quot;filter&quot; that my <br/>
husband uses for his classroom.<br/>
<br/>
** Of course, he doesn&#39;t always see the common ground, or the steps of <br/>
how I <br/>
got from here to there.  But he&#39;s been exposed to something *beyond* <br/>
what  he<br/>
know, and maybe he&#39;s put another hook on his model of the universe.   <br/>
Only he<br/>
can tell you that. **<br/>
<br/>
I really like the &quot;hook&quot; model of learning.  Things that leap across <br/>
from one set of clumps to another are the most fascinating for me.  With <br/>
a much sparser set of hooks, my son is going to get a different level of <br/>
hook-up response from stuff that I have to say, though?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t deliberately expose my child to something IF I thought he <br/>
would not find interesting.  Deliberate exposure seems kind of schooly.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t consciously promote rounding out his knowledge in areas he <br/>
seemed unenthusiastic about.  But I *would* share something that related <br/>
to things that I know he IS interested in.  &quot;Look -- they&#39;re going to <br/>
broadcast a Simpson&#39;s marathon.&quot;  &quot;There&#39;s a cat in our backyard.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s hailing!&quot;  (Maybe I&#39;ve just failed to adjust these &quot;upwards&quot; as he <br/>
has grown more sophisticated.)  The possible discrepancy between my <br/>
behavior and the suggested behavior is if I find something that is only <br/>
borderline interesting, when we aren&#39;t presently talking, then I&#39;m not <br/>
likely to pass that information on to him right then as a statement or <br/>
question or comment.  That doesn&#39;t mean it might not come out later, IF <br/>
we were talking about something related.  But, I *am* looking for advice <br/>
on this issue because we don&#39;t have many conversations, especially not <br/>
long conversations, that are sparked by ideas that come up watching TV.  <br/>
(Yes, I do comment on TV.  Usually brief comments.)  Maybe conversations <br/>
are getting squelched by a lack of listening skills on my part.  <br/>
Probably he finds it easier to think when I&#39;m not talking. &lt;g&gt; (Of <br/>
course.)  Perhaps he even finds it easier to think when *he* isn&#39;t <br/>
talking, either.<br/>
<br/>
This may be rooted in an old emotional issue for me.  I feel I may have <br/>
internalized the idea that my dad wasn&#39;t very interested in what I had <br/>
to say as a kid.  (Squirming and looking away and not responding were <br/>
the kind of clues he gave me.)  So, now, thinking that what I have to <br/>
say is uninteresting, I may not start very many conversations with my <br/>
kid.  So I&#39;m perpetuating the problem, yet for opposite reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who have hung in for this much gazing at my navel.  <br/>
I&#39;m (ironically) pretty sure that it hasn&#39;t been very interesting.  Feel <br/>
free to delete!<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s not dependent on you for dots to connect, but the more you know about <br/>
what he knows, the more easily you can provide him dots (as it were, tid-bits, <br/>
exposures, suggestions) from your side.   Common experience breeds more common <br/>
experience, and the more interface you have, the easier it will be.<br/>
<br/>
When I see a friend every week, we have LOTS to talk about.  When there&#39;s a <br/>
friend I haven&#39;t talked to for a year, there&#39;s less to talk about.  Seems odd, <br/>
but it works with kids too.  I think it&#39;s one of the main reasons kids in <br/>
school and their parents can get to where they hardly communicate at all, and <br/>
can&#39;t have an honest, candid conversation but resort to speaking in preformatted <br/>
dialogs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wouldn&#39;t consciously promote rounding out his knowledge in areas he <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have, but it&#39;s easy to do from the context of their own interests, and it&#39;s <br/>
easy to be subtle, so that I&#39;m only amusing myself.  And I learned a long <br/>
time ago (not easily, but long time &lt;g&gt;) not to take it personally and get my <br/>
feelings hurt if some song or movie or game that seems GREAT to me is not <br/>
interesting to my kid.  I didn&#39;t like it the first few dozen times, and then I <br/>
learned.  &lt;g&gt;  But WAY more dozens of times they have been interested, so I kept <br/>
making suggestions and showing them the good parts.  No kid needs to watch ALL of <br/>
Ben Hur just to see the chariot race, for instance.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s possible.  So  maybe keep your comments really short and only the good <br/>
parts (just the chariot race &lt;g&gt;), and if you get a good response, let THAT <br/>
be your message, not memories of your dad&#39;s distraction.   You&#39;re not talking <br/>
to your dad now.<br/>
<br/>
-=Thanks to all of you who have hung in for this much gazing at my navel.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m (ironically) pretty sure that it hasn&#39;t been very interesting. -=-<br/>

But there are things you can do to feel better, and one might be to realize <br/>

pass on something cool.<br/>

 <br/>
Yeah, deliberate exposure is something schooly.  But  honest-to-goodness <br/>
connections from your point of view to something he  definitely has in his point <br/>
of view is not deliberate exposure.  It&#39;s  having a relationship with your kid. <br/>
 It&#39;s being excited about the  connection and helping him make the <br/>
connection, too.  Maybe he&#39;ll only make  the connection halfway, or maybe he won&#39;t see <br/>
the connection at all.  You  talked to your kid, though, and you shared some <br/>
enthusiasm.<br/>
 <br/>
Will and I talk in the car, mostly.  Well, he talks to me all the time  he&#39;s <br/>
in my presence, but I&#39;m not interested in a lot of what he tells me about  <br/>
Spongebob, so I tune out sometimes.  (When he really wants me to  listen, he says <br/>
so.  Otherwise, he recognizes that I&#39;m not so interested  and he&#39;ll find <br/>
something else to talk about!)  But I am interested  when talks to me about the <br/>
music he&#39;s listened to recently, and I try to find  some relevance to Linkin <br/>
Park in my life.  I told him about the Lincoln  Park Zoo in Chicago, where I went <br/>
a lot as a kid, and how I wonder if the Linkin  Park band has anything to do <br/>
with the zoo or Chicago.  So we make  connections to each other in that way.<br/>
 <br/>
I can see the influence of the way my parents treated us as kids in my  <br/>
parenting, too.  My mother didn&#39;t want to listen to arguments, ever.   Her word was <br/>
law, and we couldn&#39;t be right.  Unfortunately, I inherited the  same trait.  <br/>
I temper mine (I hope!).  I still see where the same  situations that I <br/>
encountered with my mother are being recreated with my  children.  Best I can do is <br/>
try to be aware and minimize the impact.<br/>

thing is a necessary part of unschooling - at least, we&#39;ve been happily<br/>
unschooling for years without it.<br/>
<br/>
Things don&#39;t just &quot;appear&quot; on a table here. That would be off-putting to<br/>
both of us. We like knowing what&#39;s here, and we&#39;re not big on surprises<br/>
appearing in our living room. And yeah, there&#39;s not much room for<br/>
strewing stuff because all available surfaces are filled with stuff we&#39;re<br/>
using already... <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if I had a kid who was sort of at loose ends and wasn&#39;t into<br/>
directly talking about it, and who didn&#39;t mind things appearing on<br/>
tables, I could see it. I have the kid who (after 6 months of rereading<br/>
comic bookcs) will say, &quot;I need something to read. What do you think I<br/>
would like?&quot;, and I&#39;ll pull down a half-dozen books that I think she<br/>
might like and hand them to her, and she&#39;ll look through them and read<br/>
one or two... or not... Curently she&#39;s working her way through both Noel<br/>
Streatfeild&#39;s &quot;Shoes&quot; series and Orson Scott Card&#39;s &quot;Ender&quot; series,<br/>

If someone were really worried that her child seemed uninterested in science, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t fault her a bit if she got a microscope and some cool slides and <br/>
left it on the kitchen table, or better yet--one of those that hooks to the <br/>
computer so what you see in there shows on the screen.  But I would also play <br/>
with it myself and probably squeal &quot;OH MY GOSH!&quot;   We play with the microscopes <br/>
every time we go to the natural science museum, so I know my kids would be <br/>
interested, but we keep a membership there and that&#39;s where we play microscopes.  <br/>
But someone, especially one whose kids had been in school and might have <br/>
learned things like &quot;science is stupid,&quot; who worries could effectively plant <br/>
interesting stuff where her kids would see it.<br/>

That was one of the main &quot;methods&quot; of the open classroom, a method John Holt <br/>
and his contemporaries promoted in the late 60s and early 70s.  If there are <br/>
interesting things for kids to mess around with, they learn without the teacher <br/>
droning on or explaining.  They learn by their own discovery and <br/>
experimentation and play.<br/>
<br/>
In some states homeschoolers are required to report subject matter.  Texas <br/>
and New Mexico aren&#39;t among them, but there are people here from those other <br/>
states.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband brings things home from work that we&#39;d find cool, I don&#39;t <br/>
feel manipulated.  I feel like he thought of me.  He did that before we had kids. <br/>
 I save thing for my friends to see, and I buy them things from thrift stores <br/>
I think they&#39;d be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any evil manipulation in it at all.<br/>

<br/>
Another is when I&#39;m reading something on the internet or in the <br/>
newspaper and I say, &quot;Hey - listen to this!&quot; And I read some little bit <br/>
of something that I think they might find interesting. If they are very <br/>
interested, they might want to hear more or read themselves. Or not. <br/>
But I&#39;m &quot;strewing&quot; opportunities in front of them when I do this.<br/>
<br/>
Another is when I&#39;m out shopping and I buy something I think they&#39;ll <br/>
enjoy. I was at a 99 cent store and saw a big package of different <br/>
colored neon post-it notes. I bought a couple of packs and brought them <br/>
home and said - &quot;Here you guys, I got these if anybody has any use for <br/>
them. I&#39;ll put them here.&quot; That is &quot;strewing&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>
ALL the things we do to offer our children interesting experiences and <br/>
objects and opportunities are &quot;strewing their world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we just put something out where they&#39;ll find it and sometimes <br/>
we&#39;ll say &quot;Here, look at this,&quot; but I don&#39;t see a big difference. Lots <br/>
of times, in fact, I put something out, fully intending to tell someone <br/>
about it, and they discover it before I get around to it. Strewing - <br/>
whichever way it happens, imo.<br/>

I have recently personally experienced this phenomenon.  I took a new  job, <br/>
and they made me sit through 6 weeks of boring and dull training, with  tests.  <br/>
At the end there are two finals (different subjects).  If I  didn&#39;t pass the <br/>
finals, I didn&#39;t get to keep the job.<br/>
 <br/>
However, I knew once I got through the training, all the information I  would <br/>
need while I&#39;m on the job would be at my fingertips in a book or a  computer, <br/>
or from the person at the next desk.  I had been actually doing  the job <br/>
under supervision, and not studying as I had the first few weeks.   I was actually <br/>
doing the job.  When I was notified I would be taking the  final, I decided <br/>
to cram for it as soon as I realized how many of the minute  details I had <br/>
forgotten, or simply didn&#39;t use in the course of the job.   Yet, I needed to know <br/>
them ALL for these several moments in time where it would  all be put to the <br/>
test.  So, I crammed for the finals test, and I  passed.  <br/>
 <br/>
Shortly after that on the same day, they put me back on the job, which I  had <br/>
been doing already, it was starkly clear that I would soon forget the  <br/>
information I crammed in.  I remeber what I need for the job, and WHERE TO  FIND IT <br/>
when I need it, and I&#39;m learning that better as I need it.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s the binge and purge method.  I thought I had forgotten how to do  that.  <br/>
Apparently it&#39;s like riding a bike.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  I feel that strewing does work for me, when I remember to do <br/>
it.  (It isn&#39;t always something I think about.)  A strewn object (kit, <br/>
game, book, or thingumabob) quietly asks &quot;do you find me interesting&quot;, <br/>
but it doesn&#39;t shout and even better, it doesn&#39;t interrupt.  It&#39;s <br/>
quieter than me coming home and trumpeting &quot;Lookie, lookie what I <br/>
found.  Do you want to play with this now?&quot;  (You might phrase it <br/>
differently, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
I agree that strewing can feel unnatural.  But I think if it&#39;s done in a <br/>
calm and detatched way, I don&#39;t see it something that can do harm.  <br/>
(Unless you strew the back seat of the car with reading material and <br/>
someone gets carsick! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
My son has kind of a perfectionist thing where he likes privacy where <br/>
he&#39;s learning something, esp. if he might struggle or make mistakes.  <br/>
What he wants may be the opposite of what a more sociable kid would <br/>
want.  A sociable kid might strongly prefer that a new game come <br/>
attached to the hand of a parent who is available to play right now.  My <br/>
kid tends to say &quot;no&quot; first and sidle up to stuff later.<br/>
<br/>
At my house, strewing isn&#39;t always about buying new stuff or thrift <br/>
store stuff.  It&#39;s also about remembering stuff we already have in the <br/>
back of closets that my son may have forgotten and making it visible.  <br/>
Some stuff that wasn&#39;t interesting two years ago might be interesting <br/>
now.  It&#39;s certainly possible for him to enjoy something that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
recall.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about workbooks or not-fun learning games or yucky <br/>
stuff.  This is not about tricking my child into being interested in <br/>
things that he inherently finds uninteresting.  This is more about <br/>
keeping the scenery and the environment stimulating.  I think that <br/>
clutter that is constantly present, even really fun clutter in really <br/>
bright boxes, can end up being tuned out and overlooked.<br/>

occasionally clip and send articles to each other, from JAMA or the<br/>

they&#39;ll learn something new or it will pique their interest in a topic -<br/>
there&#39;s no agenda to it, I guess. It&#39;s the agenda part that feels wrong<br/>
to me. And sometimes people talk about &quot;strewing&quot; as a way to &quot;hook&quot;<br/>
kids, to expose them to things or to get them interested in a topic....<br/>
and other times people talk about it simply as sharing things with your<br/>
children that you think they&#39;ll enjoy or find interesting. I&#39;m<br/>
comfortable with the latter but not the former.<br/>

Ariel Gore said, &quot;Children need interesting mothers&quot;,  and I&#39;ve found<br/>
that to be a good unschooling tenet (feel free to substitute the primary<br/>
caregiver of your choice). <br/>

<br/>
======<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my most recent descriptions of what I do--not a bit of it is <br/>
disrespecting my children, imo or theirs. Granted, my children are <br/>
young, but I&#39;ve been unschooling, as in officially declared, for three <br/>
years now--not veteran, but not newbie either.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing, for me, is all about having cool and interesting things in the<br/>
house. If I see something I think is cool, I pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
I think that &quot;strewing&quot; is a way of creating a rich environment from<br/>
which children can freely pick and choose. It is *not* a way of slyly<br/>
constructing a curriculum that includes all the requisite subjects, like<br/>
math, science, literature, history, etc. Does that difference make<br/>
sense? Some folks hear the word &quot;strew&quot; and think, &quot;oh, okay, so I can<br/>
strew that science book or math book or classic.&quot;  That, in my mind, is<br/>
not what strewing is about; that&#39;s replacing a canned curriculum with a<br/>
manipulative one.<br/>
<br/>
Some things I strew could be considered &quot;schooly,&quot; but mostly they&#39;re<br/>
just interesting. I can remember quite clearly in elementary school,<br/>
back when we were in the same classroom all day with the same people:<br/>
there was one girl identified as &quot;gifted&quot; before the &quot;gifted and<br/>
talented&quot; program existed. She was allowed to go to the back of the room<br/>
and learn things like typing and other stuff that seemed so cool, but<br/>
which we weren&#39;t allowed to do. I also remember the G&T kids getting to<br/>
go on archeology digs while the rest of us stayed in school. The things<br/>
they were doing were still &quot;educational&quot; but they were intriguing in a<br/>
way that rote math and reading were not. This is the way I think about<br/>
the schooly stuff we have around the house: it&#39;s there because it&#39;s<br/>
cool, not because it will offer a specific lesson or a specific skill.<br/>
It&#39;s there to explore because someone may find it interesting, not<br/>
because it&#39;s a required subject.<br/>
<br/>
We got the kids an elementary chemistry set for Christmas, which I know<br/>
will prove to be one of their favorite gifts of all because they&#39;re into<br/>
that kind of thing. I&#39;ve found it really interesting and enlightening to<br/>
watch and analyze what about this gift is schooly vs. unschooly, and it<br/>
illustrates quite well the difference that I&#39;m trying to get at. What<br/>
I&#39;ve realized is that I&#39;m not going let dh use it anymore with the kids.<br/>
;) He&#39;s just not far enough along yet on his unschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids get to play around, follow their curiosity, experiment<br/>
freely, learn empirically about the different reactions and parts, then<br/>
this is a cool gift to strew in an unschooling way. When dh sits down<br/>
with them and performs a specific experiment, tells the kids to sit and<br/>
watch, won&#39;t let them use the test-tubes because *this* experiment<br/>
doesn&#39;t require them, then it becomes a lesson and a disappointing,<br/>
schooly gift with lots of rules and parameters that discourage genuine<br/>
curiosity and experimentation. Same gift, different outcome. See what I<br/>
mean? That&#39;s the difference between strewing for genuine interest and<br/>
strewing a hidden curriculum, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing needs to be about all things interesting holding equal value<br/>
and importance. We ought to be just as excited to strew some Teen Titan<br/>
toys that will fuel a current passion as we are about strewing that<br/>
chemistry set because both will offer innumerable opportunities for<br/>
learning and exploration. I value learning--life-long learning, natural<br/>
learning, organic learning. I think we learn with every breath, that&#39;s<br/>
what makes us sentient beings. I think it is impossible not to learn<br/>
unless one actively shuts down and closes off the learning<br/>
opportunity--that&#39;s what schools and lessons teach us to do, acting in<br/>
directly antithetical ways to true learning. Unschooling to me isn&#39;t<br/>
about devaluing learning, but about valuing learning in all its forms,<br/>
about valuing the act of living itself as providing the means of<br/>
learning with every step and every breath.<br/>
<br/>
Another example: I had some money from my mom to spend on the kids for<br/>
Christmas, some of which I spent on beautiful wooden bead sets, some of<br/>
which I spent at the bookstore. (I had intended to spend all of it at<br/>
this great art supply store, but it had closed down! I was very grumpy<br/>
about that.) From the bookstore, I bought:<br/>
-- a book on knitting because Julia and I both would like to learn to knit<br/>
--a book on MC Escher because Em and I had been talking about him<br/>
recently and the kids are into tessellations<br/>
--a klutz book on magic<br/>
--a klutz book on paper twirling, or quilling<br/>
--a belly dancing kit, complete with finger cymbals, CD and DVD<br/>
--a book on paper airplanes<br/>
--a book of poetry for children, called _Animal Poems_ because it has<br/>
one of the kids&#39; favorite poems, &quot;Tyger&quot; by William Blake<br/>
--a deck of Tarot cards<br/>
<br/>
This is a really practical example of the way I &quot;strew.&quot; I&#39;m also<br/>
notorious for buying things at museum gift shops--I buy all kinds of<br/>
things that look interesting. I&#39;ve gotten books, coloring books, nature<br/>
journals, craft kits, rebus makers, instruments, CDs, cards and games. I<br/>
buy interesting stuff at the hardware store--spools of colored wire,<br/>
funnels, different size measuring tapes, seeds of plants we&#39;ve<br/>
read/heard about. I buy cool computer game bundles at Sam&#39;s Club, pick<br/>
up interesting books at the library, rent topical DVDs of stuff we&#39;re<br/>
currently interested in, order toys online. I subscribe to magazines,<br/>
buy museum memberships, research vacations, explore new parks or<br/>
climbing areas. We have all kinds of stuff to explore and pull out in<br/>
our home, none of which is required. Often, things sit for months, even<br/>
years before someone takes an interest in it or the moment presents<br/>
itself to pull it out.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s probably a fine line somewhere between the kind of<br/>
strewing I do and blatant consumerism, but I&#39;m still discovering what<br/>
that is. ;)  How much do I spend on unschooling? Everything and nothing. *g*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s strewing page is good, but my favorite piece that<br/>
illustrates most closely what I do is her &quot;House as a Museum&quot; piece.<br/>

There&#39;s also an interesting thread along these lines going on now on the<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion list.<br/>
<br/>
And, here&#39;s something from an essay I&#39;m working on now that touches on<br/>
this topic:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shelves, cabinets, baskets and bins are filled with goodies to explore<br/>
and excite. I accumulate and acquire stuff with an obsessive quality<br/>
that rivals the above mother&#39;s obsession to control the stuff in her<br/>
home. As Unschoolers, we dive into topics with gusto, devouring all that<br/>
we can get our hands on and then moving onto the next entrée. Many<br/>
times, I&#39;ll see something that whets my own appetite with its future<br/>
promise and I pick it up, waiting for just the right time to pull it out.<br/>
<br/>
I also keep stuff forever, like the calligraphy set I picked up when I<br/>
was probably twelve or thirteen. Its multiple nibs and colors fascinated<br/>
my girls as we played with them and compared the pens to a quill my five<br/>
year old daughter had bought at Colonial Williamsburg. My husband&#39;s<br/>
molecule model set from college chemistry has also proven quite<br/>
interesting and offered hours of fun building in addition to<br/>
illustrating conversations on water molecules and, most recently,<br/>
chirality in nature spurred by Jim&#39;s work and Emily&#39;s recent interest in<br/>
genetic mutation, thanks to the X-men.&quot;<br/>
