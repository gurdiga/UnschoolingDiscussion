         -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 22 May 2001 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) NEWS, an <br/>
informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in Japan. It <br/>
is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and Brian -- a <br/>
multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
EDITOR&#39;S GREETINGS:  Hello again, to all our friends around the world. <br/>
We&#39;re back again with a very special, pre-summer (and in Japan, pre-rainy <br/>
season) edition of KnoK NEWS.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been following us and other news sources from Japan, you have <br/>
heard that, like other countries around the globe, Japan continues to see <br/>
a rise in the numbers of students who refuse to attend school. This goes <br/>
deeper than just cutting classes -- many of these Japanese students are <br/>
undergoing emotional trauma from the pressures of rote memorizing, <br/>
hellish exams, forced socialization and bullying. But it seems children <br/>
aren&#39;t the only victims of *gakko hokai* (school breakdown).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been hearing more and more recently about &quot;school-refusing <br/>
teachers&quot; in Japanese society. These are mostly public schoolteachers who <br/>
are suffering emotional breakdowns under the massive burden of <br/>
&quot;educating&quot; Japan&#39;s schoolchildren in an academic system that demands <br/>
conformity at all costs. <br/>
<br/>
There was one educator in Japan, believe it or not, who saw this whole <br/>
sorry state of affairs coming -- about one hundred years ago. This <br/>
visionary offered possible solutions and alternatives to just the kinds <br/>
of educational problems that parents, students and teachers alike are <br/>
facing in modern-day Japan. His name was Tsunesaburo Makiguchi <br/>
(1871-1944), and it is to him that we devote this double-edition of KnoK <br/>
NEWS.<br/>
<br/>
What made Makiguchi special was that he recognized children to be <br/>
natural-born learners, and family and community to be the cornerstones of <br/>
lifelong learning for young people. Schoolteachers, he believed, best <br/>
served their roles in offering guidance and advice to youths only when <br/>
needed, and that force-feeding facts into the heads of students was a <br/>
mistake that would someday come back to haunt Japan. Makiguchi was right <br/>
on time in his analysis.<br/>
<br/>
His beliefs may all seem like common sense today, but in the late <br/>
1800s/early 1900s, such views bordered on heresy and blasphemy. Japan had <br/>
just begun opening its borders to the world after a few hundred years of <br/>
self-imposed isolation. Industrialization was the order of the day in <br/>
this new Meiji era (1868-1912), and along with it, the enforcement of a <br/>
concept called *gimu kyoiku*, or &quot;compulsory education,&quot; that was already <br/>
spreading in Europe and North America.<br/>
<br/>
While Makiguchi was truly a far-seeing yet practical educator, he <br/>
remained mostly unknown to the Japanese public in his day. But times are <br/>
changing. A steadily increasing recognition of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi&#39;s <br/>
life and work, especially in the West, has come about. This is due in no <br/>
small part to the efforts of holistic educator and author Dr. Dayle <br/>
Bethel, our guest columnist this time, who has written an article <br/>
exclusively for KnoK NEWS.<br/>
<br/>
A pioneer of sorts in his own right, Bethel established The International <br/>
University Kyoto Learning Center (http://www.tiu-asiapacific.org) in <br/>
Kyoto, Japan, back in 1975 -- a time when the concept of community-based <br/>
learning was still a far more &quot;bizarre&quot; idea in Japanese society than it <br/>
is today.<br/>
<br/>
The Kyoto Learning Center is a branch of The International University <br/>
(http://www.tiu.com) in Independence, Missouri, US, and offers <br/>
alternative education to university students here in Japan. The Kyoto <br/>
Center&#39;s voice seems small compared to the cacophony of mainstream <br/>
Japanese university education -- with its blaring emphasis on preparing <br/>
Japanese students to be good &quot;company soldiers&quot; in the battlefields of <br/>
the business world. Be that as it may, the Kyoto Center does continue to <br/>
keep the light of community-based learning shining both in Japan and at <br/>
its sister-center in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
(By way of disclaimer, KnoK NEWS has no affiliation or connection with <br/>
T.I.U. Kyoto Learning Center, other than offering our full moral support <br/>
for the educational mission of the Center and its work for greater <br/>
educational choices in Japan and around the world.)<br/>
<br/>
Bethel himself has been researching and writing books and articles on <br/>
Makiguchi since the early 1970s, and in doing so, helped to renew <br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s legacy in Japan and abroad. We can only hope that the life <br/>
and work of this remarkable Japanese educator/philosopher will hold a <br/>
permanent and respected place in the international field of learning in <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
There are already positive signs of that happening, in fact. As this <br/>
edition of KnoK NEWS was going to press, quite coincidentally we found <br/>
that a widely circulated Japanese print magazine this month is featuring <br/>
a hefty cover story on Makiguchi and his contributions to grassroots <br/>
learning in Japan. So, the word does seem to be getting out.<br/>
<br/>
A profile before we get into the main article:<br/>
<br/>
Tsunesaburo Makiguchi was born into poverty in a rural village in Niigata <br/>
Prefecture, northern Japan, in 1871 (three years after the Meiji-era <br/>
opening of Japan had begun). As a child he was abandoned first by his <br/>
father, then his mother, and was brought up mostly by relatives. As a <br/>
young man he moved to Japan&#39;s northernmost island of Hokkaido, where he <br/>
continued his studies and became a schoolteacher, specializing in <br/>
geography. He married Kuma Makiguchi, a distant cousin, and they would go <br/>
on to have eight children in all.<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi and his family eventually moved down south to the capital city <br/>
of Tokyo, and he worked as a teacher and principal at several primary <br/>
schools. Makiguchi apparently was a thorn in the side of school <br/>
administrators, teachers and parents alike, because of his rejection of <br/>
factory-type public education and his unwavering faith in the natural <br/>
abilities of learning among children.<br/>
<br/>
He published his most famous work, *Jinsei Chirigaku* (A Geography of <br/>
Human Life), in 1903 and he had hoped it would serve as a new, more <br/>
humanistic guide for Japanese teachers in the area of childhood learning. <br/>
He was later forced to retire from the education field, and devoted <br/>
himself to Buddhism, in particular his own ethics philosophy of &quot;creating <br/>
values&quot; in society.<br/>
<br/>
As World War II raged on, Makiguchi found himself imprisoned in 1943 by <br/>
the Fascism-adherent military authorities in Japan -- not for his <br/>
educational beliefs, ironically, but because he and other scholars of the <br/>
day refused to recognize the state-imposed version of Japan&#39;s indigenous <br/>
Shinto religion. By the time he was serving his wartime prison sentence, <br/>
Makiguchi had outlived five of his own eight children.<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi himself died of malnutrition in Tokyo&#39;s Sugamo Prison in 1944, <br/>
a year before Japan&#39;s surrender in the war. He was 73 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Having died behind bars, Makiguchi was never to see the direction Japan&#39;s <br/>
educational system would take: Just two years after the end of the war, <br/>
under pressure from the U.S. occupation forces, the Japanese government <br/>
adopted in March 1947 the *Kyoiku Kihon Ho* (Fundamental Law of <br/>
Education), which essentially took education out of the divine realm of <br/>
the Japanese emperor and placed it in the hands of the Japanese public. <br/>
Around the same time, Japan also adopted the *Gakko Kyoiku Ho* (School <br/>
Education Law), which set up, for better or worse, an &quot;American-style&quot; <br/>
6-3-3 structure of compulsory public education. These two laws remain, to <br/>
this day, the pillars of Japan&#39;s education system -- and both laws <br/>
continue to be sources of heated controversy in Japanese society.<br/>
<br/>
(One of Makiguchi&#39;s proteges, it turns out, went on to establish a <br/>
Buddhist-offshoot organization called Soka Gakkai, based on the <br/>
&quot;value-creating&quot; ethics philosophy of Makiguchi during his early years as <br/>
an educator. In the five decades since the end of World War II, Soka <br/>
Gakkai has grown into a somewhat controversial organization, wielding <br/>
considerable religious, political and economic influence in Japan. But <br/>
that is another story for another time.)<br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi predicted way back in the early 1900s that schoolteachers who <br/>
stuck to the crazy notion of cramming blocks of unrelated &quot;knowledge&quot; <br/>
into their students&#39; heads would someday be in danger of losing their <br/>
jobs. This has come to be, although for slightly different reasons, <br/>
perhaps, than Makiguchi foresaw. As it turns out, Japan&#39;s growing ranks <br/>
of &quot;school-refusing teachers&quot; in these modern times do indeed hold a <br/>
tenuous grip on their jobs -- and their sanity too.<br/>
<br/>
In these days of educational crisis the world over, the beliefs and <br/>
practices of people like Tsunesaburo Makiguchi serve to remind all of us <br/>
parents, children and teachers once again that the idea of natural, <br/>
interconnected, lifelong learning is a universal one -- a human one, in <br/>
which we all have a place. May this idea continue to take root and bloom <br/>
in the years to come.<br/>
<br/>
We are sending this edition of KnoK NEWS to you in two parts (sorry about <br/>
the length!). Feel free, as always, to pass this around and share it with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

                  ON THE WEB WITH JAPANESE HOMELEARNERS<br/>
 <br/>
--Here we introduce yet another new homelearning-related website in Japan:<br/>
<br/>
SATO-KUN-CHI NO HOME SCHOOL<br/>
[lit.: &quot;Home School of Young Mr. Sato&#39;s Family&quot;]<br/>
--&gt;  http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~satokun/<br/>
Website of the Sato family of Niigata Prefecture, northern Japan, and the <br/>
homelearning adventures of their 10-year-old son. Includes sections on <br/>
daily homelearning activities, recommendations on books to read, and a <br/>
diary of the many places young Mr. Sato has visited. The whole site is in <br/>
Japanese, but don&#39;t let that deter you if you don&#39;t have the software or <br/>
aren&#39;t familiar with the language: There are plenty of great photos of <br/>
the young Sato&#39;s favorite hobbies -- raising Japanese *medaka* <br/>
(killifish) and growing his own vegetables. Check it out!<br/>

                            SAVING OUR CHILDREN:<br/>
                            A JAPANESE APPROACH<br/>

<br/>
&quot;[I]t is astounding to realize how quick are most people, and teachers in <br/>
particular, to neglect the marvelous and valuable lessons all around us <br/>
in the natural world and in our home communities and just stick to books, <br/>
using all their energy in memorizing, forgetting what they have read, so <br/>
starting to read again, forgetting, reading, forgetting, reading...and on <br/>
and on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
--Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, 1903	<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
An educational revolution is underway in the world. This revolution is <br/>
beginning to liberate thousands of children and young people in many <br/>
different countries from the oppressive, personality-stifling tyranny and <br/>
mind-numbing boredom of industrial capitalism&#39;s factory schools.<br/>
<br/>
The fascinating thing to note about this revolution is that it is <br/>
emerging in country after country spontaneously, without any one source <br/>
of leadership, without planning, without design, and largely without <br/>
notice by the general public. Spurred by rapidly growing homeschooling <br/>
movements, alternative schools and other self-learning initiatives, this <br/>
revolution in education is a microcosm of the larger progressive, <br/>
alternative and transformational movements that are emerging worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
The roots of the presently accelerating revolution in education can be <br/>
traced back to a long line of dissident educators, most important of <br/>
whom, for our purposes, are several who lived and worked during the first <br/>
half of the 20th century, particularly John Dewey, Lewis Mumford, Mahatma <br/>
Gandhi, Rudolf Steiner and Maria Montessori. In a very real sense, <br/>
today&#39;s educational revolutionaries stand on the shoulders of these early <br/>
20th-century philosopher/educator/practitioners. <br/>
<br/>
In this article, I would like to discuss the contribution of another of <br/>
these 20th-century revolutionary educators who is much less well-known. I <br/>
refer to Tsunesaburo Makiguchi (1871-1944), a Japanese <br/>
educator/geographer who lived and worked in Japan during the first four <br/>
decades of the 20th century. During the last quarter of the century, <br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s ideas, educational proposals and practical experiments have <br/>
joined with the rich legacy of Dewey, Gandhi and others to become a part <br/>
of a swelling global stream of revolutionary ideas and practices in human <br/>
learning that is helping to transform educational systems in nearly every <br/>
country in the world. <br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi&#39;s writings provide a unique perception of industrial society <br/>
from the viewpoint of one who lived and worked in Japan during the early <br/>
years of the 20th century. Makiguchi placed great hope in modernization. <br/>
He shared the high expectations of industrialism and the potential <br/>
abundance it promised, which was prevalent throughout much of the world <br/>
at that time. However, like his fellow dissident educators in other <br/>
cultures around the world, Makiguchi foresaw the dangers and tragic <br/>
consequences of the social and educational policies taking shape in <br/>
industrial societies.<br/>
<br/>
He warned against tendencies he observed developing in Japan: reckless <br/>
disregard for the environment, the sacrifice of traditional values in <br/>
pursuit of profits, and the isolating of children and young people day <br/>
after day in schools -- severing their ties with the natural environment <br/>
as well as with their families and communities and forcing them to learn <br/>
masses of fragmented, unrelated facts. It was this development in Japan <br/>
of the American system of factory schools which especially concerned him. <br/>
<br/>
Makiguchi feared that the ultimate outcome of these imported values and <br/>
policies would be disastrous for Japan, and he worked tirelessly during <br/>
the first four decades of the century, both through education and through <br/>
his writing, in formulating and promoting what he believed was a more <br/>
constructive and sustainable approach to industrial development. The key <br/>
element in creating such a society would be, he believed, the developing <br/>
of what he called a &quot;value-creating&quot; educational system based on <br/>
scientific principles of human learning and oriented to local communities <br/>
and their immediate environments. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for posting the newsletter on the<br/>
unschooling list. I might never have seen it,<br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I spent almost a year in Urawa prefecture. At the time<br/>
my sons were 8, 5, and not yet 1.  They are now 27,<br/>
25, and 20.  I have a 7 year old boy who is now an<br/>
un/home-schooler. I do recall the rigidity of the<br/>
school system. I was fortunate that my boys, being<br/>
American, did not have to attend.  My husband<br/>
insisted, though, that, the 5 year old attend<br/>
kindergarten for 1 month (&quot;just to see&quot;), while I<br/>
taught several classes of parents American English<br/>
Conversation.  It was an awful experience for him. <br/>
After the month, I continued to teach, (I taught other<br/>
Juku, also) for pay, but what a relief to get my<br/>
little boy away from that cultural wasteland!  The<br/>
older one was allowed to &quot;go to&quot; public school, but<br/>
mostly he wandered the halls to escape.  They asked if<br/>
his ego or actual learning was more important. I opted<br/>
for ego.  He learned at home. Fortunately this didn&#39;t<br/>
start until almost the end of the school year, so it<br/>
was only a few weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
An actual refusal to go to school by teachers and<br/>
students didn&#39;t seem possible at that time.  Yet it<br/>
must have been inevitable.....everyone could not keep<br/>
up the pace!! Juku after school and school all day and<br/>
homework. Maybe a few could do it, but not everybody! <br/>
I hope there are some worthwhile reforms soon, before,<br/>
before ? what? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all you have done<br/>
Sharon, now in Florida<br/>
