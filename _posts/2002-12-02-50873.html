 My husband and I call it &quot;nursing&quot; the kids.. LOL.. yeah, they have all been <br/>
weaned for years .. but its like they still have to &quot;nurse&quot;.. have my <br/>
undivided attention.  Sometimes I feel like a moma piggy with all her little <br/>
piglets scrambling to nurse at the same time.    Its become a running joke at <br/>
our house.. &quot; Oh, its nursing time... the kids want to nurse&quot;  LOL..<br/>
