you need to know exactly how your approach fits the state&#39;s idea of home<br/>
education. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s possible to make unschooling look acceptable. Once you find out<br/>
what the requirements are, you can make your practice look as though it<br/>
conforms. The more the laws (politicians and schools) are against<br/>
homeschooling, the more you need to spin your program in order to be<br/>
accepted. <br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to ask members of the support groups in your area and<br/>
see how they handle it. Find someone whose brand of hsing matches yours and<br/>
then see how they accomodate the requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Several states leave the education decisions entirely up to the parents. In<br/>
those states, you will have little to worry about. In CT, for example, there<br/>
is not even a need to inform the school that you are homeschooling. There is<br/>
no requirement even to contact the school at all, unless you are withdrawing<br/>
the child, and in that case, a letter that says. &quot;I am withdrawing my child&quot;<br/>
is sufficient. However, from what we&#39;ve seen on this list, many states have<br/>
requirements and forms and deadlines and other hoops for parents to<br/>
maneuver.<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I&#39;ve heard is this: Whatever the requirements, give the<br/>
state (school) as little as they will accept. Have as little contact as<br/>
possible with school employees. It will help you and it will also help all<br/>
other homeschoolers.</div>

likely to also be asked of the next family.<br/>
