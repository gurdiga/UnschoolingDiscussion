<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316407632">Here&#39;s one for you folks to think about.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who&#39;ve adopted children of different races, or from different <br/>
countries. One of the things that they are very conscious of throughout their <br/>
children&#39;s lives is adopting their children&#39;s culture of origin into their <br/>
families as well.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I&#39;ve tried to provide a taste of our own heritage for my son. <br/>
We&#39;ve talked about his grandparents coming from Portugal, and we even had the <br/>
opportunity to spend some time there.<br/>
<br/>
But it occurred to me that Julian is growing up in another culture. He, at <br/>
13, is probably straight (at least that&#39;s what he thinks so far, he says) and <br/>
has lesbian parents. He is part of another, non-mainstream, culture, and <br/>
regardless of his own orientation, will always carry that with him. It will likely <br/>
make a difference in his relationships and the choices he makes. Hell, already <br/>
having two moms makes a huge difference in his male awareness of how to be <br/>
loving toward women!<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve been wondering, and actually talking to Julian, about this stuff. I <br/>
asked him if he&#39;d be interested in reading a book or seeing some documentaries <br/>
about the history of gay civil rights (Yes!), or learning more about culture <br/>
(sure, why not!. It didn&#39;t work out because of timing to go to Gay Pride this <br/>
year, and we haven&#39;t been in a few years, but he&#39;d like to do it again.<br/>
<br/>
What are your thoughts? <br/>

I like my kids to be exposed to families with different backgrounds and <br/>
situations than ours. What I have found is that they&#39;re not bothered by any <br/>
differences - they acknowledge and accept.<br/>

Kathryn, have you heard that the Canadian government plans to endorse <br/>

  My husband is Persian, but grew up and was educated in India.  We take every opportunity to learn about India.  We also love television about different cultures.  Prejudice is something learned, so if we don&#39;t model it, our children will be accepting and interested in and kind to all cultures and races.  At the same time, I don&#39;t think it is terrible when a child marvels over a physical or cultural difference as being different, strange or unique.  We live around Hutterites who dress and speak differently and whose culture is totally foreign to our own.  We walk up to them when Margaux has a question and introduce ourselves and ask if it is okay to ask them some questions.  Usually, they are very friendly and want to answer.  One time there was an African decent cashier at Wal Mart when Margaux was younger.  Margaux called him Jean Paul Jean Paul, from seeing an episode of Seinfeld dedicated to a runner from Trinidad & Tobago who was dark brown.  Was this prejudice?  No way!  I just told her that he was not Jean Paul.  She said, &quot;he has skin like Jean Paul.&quot;  I said, &quot;Yeah, he does have lovely brown skin, just like Jean Paul.&quot;  That was it, it was over.    Where am I going with this?  Ummmm..... I don&#39;t know.  I think I need a nap.<br/>
<br/>
  Cultural diversity.  Well, WalMart isn&#39;t exactly .... well, yeah, it kind of is.  I mean, people from all walks go to Wal Mart.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is an awesome thing to do. Although I haven&#39;t joined, if I can ever get <br/>
thru all the posts I currently have, I would love to do so. While I am not <br/>
lesbian, gay, bi, transgendered or transsexual nor have my children exhibited any <br/>
of these, I have very close friends and relatives who are. So I guess you&#39;d <br/>
call me interested. <br/>
<br/>
Last year our dear friend J, a transsexual islander, came to Kass and Krees <br/>
birthday party. His family had lived next door to my best friend, whom we lived <br/>
with for 6 months while waiting for our home to be finished being built. The <br/>
first time we met was when he got out of his parents van in a surong (sp?) and <br/>
slide pumps. He gave me a smile and now admits that he automatically assumed <br/>
I would either turn away or look disgusted or some such action he obviously <br/>
receives regularly. I smiled back and said &quot;Hello&quot;. He looked suprised and said, <br/>
&quot;Heeeeeyyyy&quot;. As I began to pull groceries out of the car, I turned to him <br/>
and said, &quot;Where&#39;d you get those shoes? They are just too cute.&quot; He said, <br/>
&quot;Fredricks of Hollywood, honey and I got &#39;em on sale too girl!!!&quot; My hubby came out <br/>
to help unload and J looked like he expected disdain from Phil. Again to his <br/>
surprise, my hubby said,&quot;Hey! How are you?&quot; When he noticed J&#39;s shoes he said, <br/>
&quot;Nice shoes, my wife would like those. Hey Rhonda did you see those shoes?&quot; <br/>
Jay is about 6&#39; 2, 250 lbs of solid Somoain. He put his hand on his hip and <br/>
said, &quot;Why are you being nice?&quot; Phil and I looked at each other and back at J and <br/>
in unison said, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That was it, the bond had begun. So when I invited him to the girls party <br/>
along with his 3 younger siblings, I never gave it a second thought. I have quite <br/>
an array of friends, right winged,  left winged, Christians,  Pagans, and a <br/>
slew of political affiliations, homeschoolers, unschoolers, go to schoolers. <br/>
All shapes and sizes. When J walked into my house it got incredibly quiet. <br/>
Double takes and dropped jaws. Kass and Kree ran in from the pool screaming &quot;J&#39;s <br/>
here!!!!&quot; With his ever so popular hand on hip and better makeup than I have <br/>
ever applied in this lifetime, he squilled, &quot;It&#39;s time to get this party <br/>
started!!!&quot; Even the most uncomfortable guests had to laugh. He took over in the <br/>
kitchen (he can cook his a$$ off) and started talking to everyone in ear <br/>
shot....&quot;Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot; Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot; Hi I&#39;m J, who are you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The party was a great success and everyone was polite and kind reagrdless of <br/>
their understanding of &quot;what&quot; J was. Only one person questioned why I allowed <br/>
such a person to know my children and be so close with our family. I was at a <br/>
loss for words. &quot;Huh?&quot; was all that came out of my mouth. Finally after <br/>
gaining my composure back I said, &quot;For the same reasons you are my friend. He&#39;s <br/>
kind, he&#39;s funny, he&#39;s caring, he&#39;s smart, he loves us.&quot; I wasn&#39;t angry at having <br/>
to explain it, I was just caught off guard. Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t have been. I&#39;m <br/>
not sure. The explaination I got was something about hate the sin, love the <br/>
sinner....OK whatever, NOT how we see it, but if that makes them feel better, I <br/>
guess it&#39;s better than cruelty.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;m babbling again, but I it made me think about how little this <br/>
culture has changed when it comes to orientations. My kids know we aren&#39;t gonna <br/>
care one hoot, who they love as long as they give love and receive love. We had a <br/>
discussion the other day that it&#39;s too bad that families still disintegrate <br/>
over these issues. My girls watched an HBO movie with me not long ago called <br/>
&quot;Normal&quot;. It&#39;s about a transgendered man, married for 25 years who finally comes <br/>
out to his family. It was a beautiful movie and we all watched it as a <br/>
family. We all cried at the parts where he was taunted, we all cried when he told <br/>
his children, we all cried when he got beat up for being who he was. It lead to <br/>
a wonderful family dialogue on tolerance. I have to say, I loved that my <br/>
children didn&#39;t understand why there is even a need for such a discussion. Sadly <br/>
they know now. When their schooled friends come over and call names such as <br/>
gaylord, lezzy, or faggot, my kids are quick to repremand them.They ask if the <br/>
kids know what they just said? They ask how many such persons the taunting kids <br/>
know who fit that discription? They ask what will those kids do if their <br/>
brothers or sisters end up being one of the desciptions? They always end with, &quot;What <br/>
would you do if your child was?&quot; And they wait for a real answer. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully your list will grow and people can learn more about whatever it is <br/>
they fear. <br/>
Thanx for creating it.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda  <br/>

There are legal rights you only receive when married.  Um, taxes, insurance, <br/>
the ability to visit your loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights and <br/>
taxes are affected, I think there may be more.  <br/>
<br/>
My hunny and I got married after 10 years together, for the most romantic <br/>
reasons...Taxes and insurance.    lol  <br/>
<br/>
Just because we happen to be hetero, we had that right, went out, paid $10 <br/>
for the license and did the deed.  And we get the benefits.  I almost feel <br/>
guilty, it&#39;s not fair that others that want the benefits,  don&#39;t have those same <br/>
rights.  <br/>

just astounds me.  Much like a conversation I had with other friends about<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t say that anyone I&#39;ve heard talk about not liking gay marriages and<br/>
how it shouldn&#39;t be allowed have used the argument that it negates theirs.<br/>
They just seem to think it&#39;s wrong. People fear what they don&#39;t know and a<br/>
lot of people don&#39;t want to learn what they don&#39;t know. It&#39;s different and<br/>
not the &quot;normal&quot; of what they know and live and well then it can&#39;t possibly<br/>
be right. It can&#39;t possibly be normal and good. In my experience with such<br/>
narrow minded people, they lump gays in with people of color and people that<br/>
come here now from other countries and people of other faiths or none at<br/>
all. It&#39;s sad and pathetic really because I have spoken with these people<br/>
trying so hard to understand what the &quot;real&quot; reason is for their prejudice.<br/>
The honest truth is there isn&#39;t any real reason. It&#39;s just a because. I find<br/>
people like that very annoying and not at all worth any time I can afford<br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when people have such a clearly cultural definition of what marriage<br/>
is (&quot;Marriage is when a boy and a girl fall in love and get married and have<br/>
children&quot;) then even when they know intellectually that all marriages aren&#39;t<br/>
like that, they have trouble seperating that image from their own life.<br/>
<br/>
My friend is a very smart woman, who I don&#39;t tend to think of as homophobic.<br/>
I just don&#39;t think she makes the connections between what her life is like<br/>
and what some other people&#39;s lives are like.  We got past the point of<br/>
polite before we could talk about &quot;civil unions&quot; much.  OR maybe I&#39;ve just<br/>
forgotten that part.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see there being &quot;civil unions&quot; for everyone.  Gay, straight,<br/>
poly, whatever.  And those legal contracts have certain assumptions, much as<br/>
&quot;marriage&quot; does now.  And then if you want to get &quot;married&quot; you can go to<br/>
your priest, priestess, swami, whatever.    Those contracts would have<br/>
certain assumptions within your religious community.  The state has a say in<br/>
one and not in the other.  As it is, the state is really supporting one over<br/>
the other.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, getting married means that I have access to hubby&#39;s past financial<br/>
records, can speak for him in the hospital, can sign for him in certain<br/>
circumstances, etc.  And if he croaks, the assumption is that I get his<br/>
money.  (Not that the poor dear has any!)  Why should his gender make any<br/>
difference in those areas?<br/>

That makes no sense to me. I just can&#39;t see how someone can reason out that<br/>
same sex marriages make hetero marriages less. So maybe people who get<br/>
married and divorce and marry and keep on going a few times makes mine less<br/>
meaningful too??? It even sounds silly.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as procreation goes, what do we do with all the couples who just<br/>
don&#39;t want kids??? Make them divorce? Yeah, that&#39;s what we should do. Sorry,<br/>

If it doesn&#39;t effect your life, why does it matter? And why is it so <br/>

does it matter who we love instead of whether we are able to give and receive <br/>
love?<br/>

objections is the fear that the only thing that keeps many people from same<br/>

if we remove the social stigma, then what&#39;s to prevent our kids and anyone<br/>
we can&#39;t control from thinking same sex sexual relations is normal and<br/>
playing around with it or ::: gasp ::: thinking it&#39;s better.<br/>
<br/>
And as evidence to support that, people will point to the decreased social<br/>
stigma on premarital sex and drugs and dress compared to 50 years ago and<br/>
all the problems it has &quot;caused&quot; in our current society. Not to mention the<br/>
vaguely remembered impression that wrapped up in the downfall of Rome were<br/>
orgies where no one cared who (or what) they had sex with. It all just seems<br/>
to reinforce the idea that the only reason we&#39;re &quot;good&quot; and that<br/>
civilization is stable is because of external pressure and threat of<br/>
punishment not to be &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>

&quot;What&#39;s your reaction to Ottawa&#39;s decision to recognize same-sex marriage?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two of the callers gave the above argument but did not support it with any <br/>
facts. I didn&#39;t hear the whole show but most callers I heard were <br/>
supportive of same-sex marriage.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear or read an honest argument for why it dimiishes <br/>
heterosexual marriage. Personally, I think the more people we have in <br/>
loving unions and declaring that love before society, the better our <br/>
society will be for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember that freedom of religion is protected under the <br/>
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, so religious groups have the <br/>
freedom to practice according to their doctrine. No religion can be forced <br/>
to marry anyone except whom they determine is marriageable. Catholic <br/>
priests, for example, will not be required to marry a gay couple, just as <br/>
they never have been and never will be required to marry a formerly <br/>
divorced couple.<br/>
