<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018897605">The media is really interested in unschooling at the moment! I&#39;ve been<br/>
fielding calls and e-mails left and right from people interested in<br/>
interviewing unschoolers for television programs or for articles. Here&#39;s the<br/>
latest:<br/>
<br/>
Mark Harris is writing a story on unschooling for Hope magazine<br/>
(www.hopemag.com). He says they profile individuals and small organizations<br/>
working for social change. Their next issue will examine the life of<br/>
teenagers, and his story will show how some real teens have gone about<br/>
educating themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, he&#39;s looking for teenagers who are actively unschooling, and<br/>
who live in the eastern PA, NJ, or NYC area.<br/>
<br/>

Deadline:<br/>
Please contact him by June 16, 2000<br/>

Feel free to pass this on to any unschooling teens you know of. Just be sure<br/>
to include the entire message, especially the deadline.<br/>
