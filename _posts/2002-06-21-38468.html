I guess I think unschooling includes not feeling that it&#39;s<br/>
necessary  to teach someone how to take responsibility for<br/>
oneself.   It&#39;s like everything else, if it&#39;s important to a<br/>
person, they will learn it.<br/>

pushing him to learn to read.  If he wants clean socks, he washes <br/>
them.  It&#39;s not that I would *never* under any circumstances wash his socks <br/>
or remind him.  It just isn&#39;t my problem.  It&#39;s his.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712372323">Okay I am not talking about teenagers  I am talking<br/>
about children 3-7  but how do things become important<br/>
to them.   My kids have pokemon cards  which they<br/>
frequently leave outside and then cry and scream and<br/>
beg grandma to buy them new ones because they didn&#39;t<br/>
take care of what they had.  It isn&#39;t my<br/>
responsibility to care for them.  I do make certain my<br/>
kids bicycles are out of the street but I also remind<br/>
them repeatedly not to leave them in the street.  My<br/>
children used to have games,  I didn&#39;t throw any<br/>
pieces away  but they have taken pieces to this<br/>
grandmas house or this friends house  or my older son<br/>
traded all the candyland cards for a tiny bottle  and<br/>
so I did throw away all the games that no longer had<br/>
playing pieces after I ascertained that the pieces<br/>
were no longer in our house.  So my children are no<br/>
longer allowed to have games because they will not<br/>
take care of them,  they sometimes get toys taken away<br/>
for a while because I want them to learn that in the<br/>
cruel hard world in which they will live in someday <br/>
if they don&#39;t take care of their things the things<br/>
will be taken away  and  me taking away television<br/>
time or a toy for a while  is better than them having<br/>
a car other expensive item stolen forever because they<br/>
didn&#39;t have mom around to make certain they took the<br/>
keys out of the car  etc.   I know people I work for<br/>
whose kids never have to take responsibility  and<br/>
thats fine if they can afford the consquences  but my<br/>
husband and I are dirt poor and can&#39;t allow are<br/>
children to suffer those kinds of things  so we have<br/>
to teach them somehow.   It is the way my family works<br/>
 if yours doesn&#39;t work that way  that is fine.    But<br/>
for those of you who say that kids will learn<br/>
responsibility  how did your children learn not to run<br/>
infront of moving cars  or not to go with strangers <br/>
etc    if children can learn only by doing and not my<br/>
any other means   my little area  is a very dangerous<br/>
place.  My children will probably never do laundry as<br/>
long as they live at home  but I do think they should<br/>
be able to put the dirty clothes in the laundry room  <br/>
they should be able to pick up their own trash  and<br/>
put dirty dishes in the sink.    My childrens father<br/>
does none of this  and when something bad happens  he<br/>
always blames someone else it is never his fault  and<br/>
my children seem to have his view of the world  and I<br/>
am working to change that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are many, many ways to learn. One way to  learn about the dangers<br/>
of busy streets is being hit by a car, true. Another way is to talk about<br/>
the dangers of fast cars. Another is to intentionally leave something<br/>
like a melon in the driveway and then run over it with our car. Another<br/>
is to crouch down in between two cars parallel-parked along a busy road<br/>
and watch the cars zipping by at eye level, so fast they blow your hair<br/>
back. Another is to watch how people you trust always act carefully and<br/>
cautiously around cars and roads. <br/>
<br/>
Punishing a child for running in a road doesn&#39;t lead to any sort of<br/>
learning, IMO. That&#39;s training, or operant conditioning. The child is<br/>
learning a behavior, not understanding a possible risk. Training doesn&#39;t<br/>
enable kids to make good decisions on their own, it just trains them to<br/>
make certain reponses to a small set of stimuli. <br/>
<br/>
Your posts sound like you&#39;re really frustrated with your husband and wish<br/>
he would help you out more. That&#39;s a valid issue. However, I think the<br/>
way you&#39;re raising your children is more likely to result in adults like<br/>
your husband than in responsible, self-motivated adults, based on the<br/>
examples I&#39;ve seen posted to this list. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  So my children are no<br/>
longer allowed to have games because they will not<br/>
take care of them, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have dozens of games which *I* took care of.  Now that they&#39;re older, <br/>
they&#39;re really happy to have them, and they take care of these and others <br/>
they&#39;ve gotten, because they see the advantage now of having a ten year old <br/>
game you really love.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have let them take game parts out of the house.  I would have <br/>
talked them into taking the whole game or none of it.  <br/>
<br/>
To banish games from an unschooling home is going to remove one of the best <br/>
learning tools ever.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;they sometimes get toys taken away<br/>
for a while because I want them to learn that in the<br/>
cruel hard world in which they will live in someday &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someday?<br/>
<br/>
They might get a broken leg someday.  I did, when I was 32 years old.<br/>
I would not have been better prepared for that broken leg had my mother <br/>
broken my finger every year or two.  And there are people who do NOT have a <br/>
cruel world tear them up.  So the preparation for that was... why?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;my husband and I are dirt poor and can&#39;t allow are<br/>
children to suffer those kinds of things &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the suffering itself as something to be avoided rather than <br/>
looking at the things, maybe your priorities will change a little.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  But for those of you who say that kids will learn<br/>
responsibility  how did your children learn not to run<br/>
infront of moving cars  or not to go with strangers <br/>
etc   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They were with me.  I didn&#39;t hold their hand every second, but if a car was <br/>
near I did, and I talked to them about why and advised them on safe and <br/>
unsafe places to stand.<br/>
<br/>
How did YOUR children learn not to go with strangers?  Did you take TV away <br/>
each time they did?  I don&#39;t think so.  It likely involved rational <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My childrens father<br/>
does none of this  and when something bad happens  he<br/>
always blames someone else it is never his fault  and<br/>
my children seem to have his view of the world  and I<br/>
am working to change that..&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of it could be genetic, but whether it is or not, being sweet and loving <br/>
is better than being harsh.<br/>

since the world is a cruel hard place (in your opinion),<br/>
home should be too?  Why not make home a respite from the<br/>
cruel hard world?  I don&#39;t believe that suffering has to be<br/>
learned.  My belief is that if the world is hard (at times),<br/>
then one is better served by learning how to make ones life<br/>
easier and more pleasant, not learning how to &quot;suck it<br/>
up.&quot;<br/>
