I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok to talk about friend A to friend B the way she 
was doing.  However, I do want her to know it&#39;s ok to talk to ME about 
her friends, even if she is venting about frustrating things they do.  -==-<br><br>When
 my daughter was 7, posing questions or brief, simple scenarios that 
appealed to her still-emerging sense of empathy sometimes helped with 
situations like this. <br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1505174351gmail_default" style="font-size:small;"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1505174351gmail_default" style="font-size:13px;">I
 might ask a question like, &quot;If I were (D, her friend&#39;s name), hearing 
you say those things about J, I might wonder whether you were saying bad
 things about me to other people. It might make it harder for D to feel 
like she could talk to you. Does that make sense?&quot; Sometimes this kind 
of question started a good conversation. More often it didn&#39;t go far, 
but usually it seemed like she understood my point. (Sandra asked about what&#39;s wrong with this kind of talk -- to me, what&#39;s wrong with it is that it doesn&#39;t foster trust among friends, and it can hurt feelings and harm friendships if the trash talk gets back around to the person it&#39;s about -- which it often did when I was that age. I&#39;m wary of getting close to people who bad-mouth others, because often it isn&#39;t an isolated occurrence.)<br><br>And I might 
also say, maybe at a different time to avoid saying too much at once and
 making it all sound like parental blah-blah-blah, &quot;I wish I&#39;d known you
 were feeling so frustrated with J. Maybe next time, if you could let me
 know, I could help you change things, or end the play date sooner 
without making anyone feel bad. Do you think that could work?&quot; That sort
 of suggestion led to good conversations and did work out well -- my 
daughter was more able to call in my help when things got tough.<br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1505174351gmail_default" style="font-size:small;">I&#39;m
 looking forward to seeing what other ideas might emerge here. These are

Ask her then what she wants to do. Even though &quot;J talks and talks,&quot; it might not be horrible all the time and she might tell you to let J stay. Perhaps she&#39;s trying to be kind to her friend by letting her stay. If she wants J to leave, you can make that happen without your daughter being the one to tell her.<br><br>It&#39;s a lot for a 7-year-old to make those kinds of decisions in the abstract. Help her do what she wants to do, in the situation.<br><br>Robin B.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139392818">There is a prejudice in our culture against women&#39;s ways of being and learning, and toward that of men.<br/>
<br/>
Men learn by doing things and watching other people do them.  They learn to build houses and hunt and all kinds of things that way, in a very natural way.  Some women do too, but it&#39;s predominantly the way men hang out with other men and learn to row a boat or tie a knot or fish.<br/>
<br/>
Women tell stories to each other.  They talk about cooking and childbirth and about human interactions.  Social &quot;niceties&quot; are what women have been responsible for in most families in most societies related to the English-speaking world. There might be some exceptions, but they&#39;re not in the realm of thank-you notes and party decorations, remembering the birthdays of girlfriends of sons, and buying and wrapping gifts (while knowing what sort of gift is appropriate for what occasion, and how much to spend based on how close the relationship or friendship is, and balanced against how wealthy the main gift giver(s) will be so you don&#39;t make them look bad by spending too much.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all tied in with religion and fears, but &quot;gossip&quot; has been considered a sin for a few hundred years, and was especially villified, I think, by the Puritans.<br/>
<br/>
If someone dies, other people related to that person, or friends with that person, need to know.  Not in a sensationalist way, but in such a way that others will not be insensitive.  But that can&#39;t be done without talking behind their backs.   Ditto all kinds of other life changes—birth, marriage, divorce.<br/>
<br/>
If someone does something very nice for you, it&#39;s not a bad thing to tell all your friends.<br/>
<br/>
I just had the same two electricians to my house for the second time.  I love these guys!  I might go online and give them a nice review, but that will be behind their backs.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I&#39;m asking.  To use a phrase like &quot;talking about people behind their backs&quot; is to quote someone else.  It&#39;s to make a vague yet sweeping negative appraisal of something... vague.<br/>
<br/>
Women, especially, talk to each other.  Some men are that way, too.  My friend Jeff knows and remembers every little bit of relationship or friendship anyone he knows ever had and is a good protocol advisor because he knows who needs/wants/knows/expects what, and which other peoples&#39; presence might make things awkward.  He uses his power for good.<br/>
<br/>
And I think the important thing is whether there is malice, or whether it&#39;s conversational.  People have the right to talk about their own lives, and other people are a part of our lives.  If I were to tell you lots of stories about these electricians, would it be gossip or me telling something interesting I learned from and about a nice couple of men?<br/>
<br/>
Go easy about condemning something with a phrase that came to you whole.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/phrases">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t like is when people tell lies about other people.  I don&#39;t care how they do it.  If what is said is untrue, that is evil.<br/>
What I don&#39;t mind is when people tell nice stories about other people, so as to raise the other person&#39;s reputation for good and well-deserved reasons.<br/>
<br/>
There are stories in between those and they should not all be reviled as &quot;gossip&quot; or &quot;talking behind someone&#39;s back.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391550700"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;She said, &quot;I spent all day with J! [another friend] It was horrible! She talks and talks and talks! She just never stops talking!&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a similar experience to this recently.  Ethan was visiting with a friend who has recently been introduced to Minecraft, and is very excited about it.  This friend was sharing *all* of his ideas with Ethan in a nonstop stream of dialogue.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, Ethan has done this with me many, many times.  There have been times when I&#39;ve needed to say to Ethan, &quot;Wow, man!  You have a lot of good ideas!  I need to take a bit of a break from listening so I can process some of them.&quot;  Usually, he says, &quot;Just one more!&quot; and shares one more before he or we move on to something else for a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
So, because I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a lot of excited ideas all at once, I could see that Ethan was getting a bit overwhelmed with his friend&#39;s sharing.  Internally I chuckled a bit before I headed over to offer another ear for the excited friend.  That made some room for Ethan to have a bit of a break.  Then the conversation moved toward more of a two way communication.<br/>
<br/>
Later that night I said to Ethan, &quot;[Friend] sure was excited to share his ideas with you today.&quot;  Ethan said &quot;Yeah!  I just couldn&#39;t listen to it all!&quot;  I said &quot;I understand.&quot;  Again, inside, I chuckled a bit.  He&#39;s figuring it out.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now that Ethan is ten, I don&#39;t spend as much time with him and his friends as I did when he was younger.  I often do play with them all, but they like to do their own thing too.  But, regardless of whether I&#39;m playing with them or not, I do still keep within earshot so that I can offer help when I feel like help might be appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok to talk about friend A to friend B the way she was doing. However, I do want her to know it&#39;s ok to talk to ME about her friends, even if she is venting about frustrating things they do.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really do want Ethan to find people besides me that he feels like he can be open with.  I feel good when I hear him sharing with others - good things and difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
When I share a struggle I&#39;m having with someone, I&#39;m usually looking for feedback to help me better navigate a particular relationship, or else I&#39;m trying (probably awkwardly) to establish personal boundaries for myself through example.  In either case I&#39;m hoping the person I&#39;m sharing with will trust that I have no ill intent.  <br/>
<br/>
Trust that your daughter is not sharing her feelings with her friend from a place of mean spiritedness.  Maybe the experience *was* horrible for her.  See if you can help her have it not be so horrible next time.  Before the friend comes over again, maybe ask your daughter for suggestions on how you can help her have a more enjoyable time with her friend.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253847971">This is my first time posting.<br/>
I really enjoy the discussions and I really have found the ideas exchanged very useful.<br/>
I am by nature quite reflective and so things like this have given me much fodder for thought over the years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a dilemma, I agree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First & foremost I think we want our children to know that there is value in honesty.<br/>
Also I think there is a thin line here that I myself find hard to negotiate: how do we teach a morality or ethic?<br/>
How do we emphasize allowing our children to feel at home, and more importantly, at peace with their genuine feelings?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t.<br/>
Don&#39;t teach.  Unschooling will start to flow when teaching is abandoned.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teach">http://sandradodd.com/teach</a><br/>
<br/>
Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, unschooling cannot begin to work.<br/>
(That&#39;s a quote from this:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolinmyhead">http://sandradodd.com/schoolinmyhead</a> )<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spirituality">http://sandradodd.com/spirituality</a><br/>
That has a bit about morality.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, what about the day when, as needs be, our children complain about us, &quot;behind our backs?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why &quot;as needs be&quot;?<br/>
When my children talk about me or their own dad to other people, that is not &quot;behind our backs.&quot; That is them discussing their real lives.  We were once a huge part of their lives.  Someday we will be a small part.  We&#39;re tipping toward smaller now that they&#39;re young adults.<br/>

Live your life in such a way that other people will trust you. When you make decisions, make generous, selfless decisions so that others benefit. When you say something, do your best to say what is fair and right and true. When you write, write things you don&#39;t mind people taking out and sharing. <br/>
<br/>
A person is only trustworthy if he has earned trust, if he is worthy of being trusted.<br/>
<br/>
Live so that your kdis have great stories to tell about you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330710850">Right. It was a rhetorical question. We cannot teach morality--and what is it anyway? <br/>
<br/>
I want to trust. <br/>
I want to trust that my children are acting from a healthy impetus and know that the world is imperfect.<br/>
<br/>
When thinking about the situation discribed, I thought the daughter spoke to the situation &quot;being horrible,&quot; not the person, not her friend. <br/>
Some situations are not a good as others. It&#39;s okay to value events as &quot;not great.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am imperfect. I cannot aim for perfection.<br/>
A complaint about me is not a condemnation. It&#39;s a form of adjustment, its an appraisal. Perhaps it leads to a tweaking.<br/>
<br/>
Trust is made over time. Hopefully I will have many moments to contribute to any assessment abut my character--not only the &quot;moment that just happened.&quot; I want to give and be given second chances---and third, fourth etc.<br/>
<br/>
I want to keep looking at how I can live in the moment and be compassionate.<br/>
I want to take the slow ride.<br/>
