This is a StrongBad e-mail that will be more educational (or more  <br/>
amusing) for those among us who went to school, particularly anyone  <br/>
who has been assigned a diorama, or has helped someone else make a  <br/>
diorama.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>

My 8 year old just watched this with me and asked &quot;can we make a diorama?&quot;  I said yes and excitedly she said &quot;we&#39;ll need to get a shoe box, shoe boxes work the best&quot;<br/>
So for some kids, they are just fun.  I have a feeling my daughter will soon have a bedroom full of them.<br/>

They&#39;re fun if you want to make them, and torturous if you don&#39;t.   <br/>
That&#39;s why unschooling works!  It avoids &quot;torturous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Barbie rooms.  Those are dioramas, pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
Disney&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a Small World.&quot;  Animated dioramas.<br/>
<br/>
In Salt Lake City there is a museum of the history of the church, and  <br/>
there are some cool dioramas.<br/>
<br/>
Museums of natural history often have animals (fake or stuffed) in  <br/>
naturalish scenes, with that cool painting effect that makes it seem  <br/>
to go on at a distance.<br/>
<br/>
Window dressings in stores are dioramas (sometimes even historical,  <br/>
in antique stores, or exotic as at Banana Republic sometimes, or surf/ <br/>
beachish in spring when they&#39;re selling water sports stuff)<br/>
<br/>
Christmas displays (trains, lit-up miniature houses, reindeer on  <br/>
rooftops) are dioramas.  Creche scenes are traditional dioramas with  <br/>
elements added at different times through the season.<br/>

What else?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Museum of Natural History in Sydney used to have, and may still have, <br/>
miniature dioramas that were viewed through windows. They were my favorite <br/>
part of the place. Tiny little dinosaurs. Itty bitty trees.<br/>
<br/>
Disneyland has more than just Small World - there are the store windows on <br/>
Main Street illustrating all the animated movies and California Adventure <br/>
has miniature dioramas illustrating the history of tortillas.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum of Natural History in Los Angeles has beautiful miniatures of <br/>
California history - scenes, missions, a cut away model of a ship - <br/>
beautiful miniature/scale work.<br/>
<br/>
Is trompe l&#39;oiel life size work the same as a diorama? I always thought of <br/>
them as being miniatures, but I could be wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297670674">Theater set designers make dioramas - often with electricity, moving  <br/>
parts, and curtains. They can be exquisite!<br/>
<br/>
Also, doll houses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61725397">Don&#39;t know if this is technically a diorama or not:<br/>
<br/>
Right now Zachariah (age 13) has half the family room set up as a WWII battle scene.<br/>
<br/>
He has trenches made with blankets, the camera tripod is covered in a sheet to make a look out tower, the &quot;GI Joes&quot; are lined up along the trench with riffles and various armament aimed / posed.  The couch is also draped in an afghan for a mountain side with men posed in combat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He had me rent the TV series &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot; for him to watch.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the tripod he wanted my opinion if it was high enough to be a mountain, radio tower or look out tower in scale to the GI Joes&#39; height.  We decided it was more to scale to a short look out tower.<br/>
