<div id="ygrps-yiv-438556126">If you give a child freedom...<br/>
They&#39;ll want to play and watch tv all day...<br/>
So you let them play and watch tv.....<br/>
and they find something really cool they want to look up on the internet<br/>
and if they find something really cool on the internet they might just sit there and read for over an hour<br/>
when they get done they&#39;ll want to get up and move around <br/>
and they might work on some choreography for a while and write it down <br/>
If you read what they&#39;ve written you&#39;ll realize that wow! their spelling has gotten a lot better <br/>
After a while they&#39;ll tire of the choreography and you&#39;ll invite them to help you cook <br/>
You need to make a double batch so they multiply the fractions in their head <br/>
If they have enjoyed cooking with you they might go on to make a yummy cake for their family<br/>
Everyone will eat the cake and enjoy <br/>
Then they&#39;ll decide to watch mythbusters <br/>
....and come out to tell you about alkaline metals<br/>
Then you&#39;ll snuggle off to sleep <br/>
.....Wonder what well do tomorrow ? <br/>
