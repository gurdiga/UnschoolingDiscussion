<div id="ygrps-yiv-166277370">Well it is suppossed to be around 0 degrees by the middle of the week, won&#39;t <br/>
that be fun?<br/>
I envy those of you where it&#39;s warm....especially Florida.  My senior year of <br/>
college I had an internship at the botanical gardens in Sarasota, FL- it was <br/>
beautiful!!!!<br/>
My husband is from upstate NY and that&#39;s where we are and will stay it looks <br/>
like...unless we move to Vt which he is interested in as well.  My dad was in <br/>
the Air Force and we lived all over.  I do miss swimming in the pool on xmas <br/>
day!<br/>
But oh, the warm weather would be nice!!!!   Hope you are enjoying it because <br/>
I would really love to take the kids for a nice walk to the park in shorts.   <br/>
Well, we could but it might be a bit chilly! LOL<br/>
