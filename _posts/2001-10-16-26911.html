<div id="ygrps-yiv-391761616">Hi gang. Good to be back on this list again. Now you know just what <br/>
it takes to send me off the deep end of the ship. But I&#39;ve regained <br/>
my composure, taken a few deep breaths, helped Mark get the next <br/>
issue of the magazine out the door (almost), and I&#39;m ready to get <br/>
back to work here again if you&#39;ll have me. If anyone wants to <br/>
complain about my most unprofessional behavior, well, I&#39;ll listen. Or <br/>
read. Or whatever. But the bottom line is I&#39;m only human, and just as <br/>
prone to temper tantrums as anyone else. You have the proof in this <br/>
list&#39;s archives. Be kind.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am sorry for blowing up and storming off. I should have <br/>
taken the advice I&#39;ve given others countless times in the past and <br/>
just quit reading for a while, let the whole thing blow over (as I <br/>
figured it would eventually), and picked up again... well... about <br/>
now. Instead I did something I *rarely* do (honest) and let my worst <br/>
instincts get the best of me. I feel somewhat foolish, sheepish, <br/>
well, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve got a lot of catching up to do here, and a lot of plans <br/>
for the future. I&#39;ll be online off and on this evening (Thursday), <br/>
and will check my email in the morning, but then I&#39;ll be offline most <br/>
of Friday and Saturday: Mark untarped the boat this afternoon and <br/>
we&#39;re going sailing - first trip of the year! Yippee!<br/>
<br/>
More later tonight,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m delighted that you returned!<br/>
<br/>
One bit of unsolicited advice and you can do with it what you will, I <br/>
think you need to make it very clear in the intro to the group that <br/>
this is an open forum and HEM does not necessarily endorse everything <br/>
said here.<br/>

made, but we&#39;re wrapping the issue this morning and getting ready to <br/>
leave and I&#39;m not even supposed to be reading here... &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
