      <br/>
      We have lived in Minnesota before and Matt did run a tile business <br/>
there.  However, that was in the Twin Cities, where there were lots of <br/>
customers but also lots of expenses, which resulted in the business being <br/>
very much full time.  This time, we are looking at the areas that are 2 hrs <br/>
or more from the Cities, maybe within an hour of St. Cloud, a smaller city <br/>
with a university that some of our family may use.<br/>
     In these areas, land is much less expensive, plus they are very pretty <br/>
and peaceful.  My sister lives in Minneapolis and always enjoys our visits so <br/>
when we want that city life, we can always go see her.<br/>
     We want to be able to meet all of our basics with his retirement so that <br/>
if one of us chooses to work for pay, it can be just to pay for a certain <br/>
thing, such as a trip we want to take.  I know it sounds crazy to a lot of <br/>
people but I truly believe it can be done.<br/>
     By the way, I checked out that site on adult freedom and it was great.  <br/>
I enjoyed your essays.  Your experiences in life sound quite varied and <br/>
interesting.  <br/>

approaches to life which I know of.  It sure beats the alternatives.<br/>

&quot;I was the teamplayer, but now that&#39;s all gone,<br/>
I was the MBA, but now I am John.<br/>
And so dear friends, you&#39;ve just got to carry on.<br/>
The dream is over.&quot;</div>
