<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542329672">Has anyone found anything that their kids will take when sick? Kids who <br/>
normally won&#39;t take anything at all?<br/>
<br/>
I have two here that seem like they would rather die then take something to <br/>
ease their discomfort. I&#39;ve tried different liquids, chewables, soft chews <br/>
and pills. The only thing I can get into them is colloidal silver, which may <br/>
make things not get worse but doesn&#39;t help with the symptoms. Other than <br/>
that and some saline nose spray, they sniff and snot and sneeze all over the <br/>
house and get anyone who isn&#39;t sick, sick. I have one like that now and I&#39;m <br/>
desperately trying to keep everyone else healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We often have this problem.  Right now my kids will only take medicine that <br/>
happens to be orange in color and flavor.  It stinks.  And of course, when <br/>
they get sick next time, they will demand another color.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t eat or drink during the first few days of <br/>
a bad cold or asthma attack.  We just had croup here, it was awful.  I resort <br/>
to threatening pedyalite and using a dropper.  Usually before that I&#39;ll buy <br/>
all sorts of stuff that I think might be appealing or fun.  Popsicles, <br/>
pudding, jello, different juices, it&#39;s all an exerice in futility.  she tends <br/>
to vomit with mucus production and after that, all food and drink are bad.<br/>
<br/>
We did find those lollipop cough drops this time around, they worked.  Zinc <br/>
lozenges made for kids, I think.  I didn&#39;t buy them.  And carrot/apple vruit <br/>
juice worked this time.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a challenge.  I&#39;m sorry you are going through this now, today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599672347">My dad used to make us hot lemonade.  Hot water and honey with lemon juice <br/>
squeezed into it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t like meds, but as they&#39;ve gotten older they favor NyQuil <br/>
gelcaps if they&#39;re really too sick to sleep.  And most of them have tolerated <br/>
(all of them at one time or another) the orange-flavored Triaminic (sp?) <br/>
liquid, although it doesn&#39;t have a cough suppressant in it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What about external stuff?  There is some Johnson&#39;s baby-bath stuff with the <br/>
vaporous stuff like Vicks has, so just being in the bath with it cleans out <br/>
head-gunk.   And then there&#39;s Vicks itself, rubbed on the back or chest of <br/>
the kid (or adult, when it&#39;s me and I&#39;m tired of being too tired to get well) <br/>
so it heats up the whole body under the covers and vaporizes the air too!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s funny Sandra, the orange Triaminic is one of the worst as far as I&#39;m <br/>
concerned. I took it when I was pregnant and thought it was nasty. So thick <br/>
and sweet. My kids never liked that one. They have always taken the purple <br/>
Dimetapp well and well now, it&#39;s a different story.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about external stuff?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh I always have Vicks on hand. I grew up on that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So tonight it was a different story. Sierra finally took the regular <br/>
Dimetapp only because it was slightly better than the cough one. The baby <br/>
took a soft chew and Joseph refused anything and everything we had. Normally <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make such a big deal over something that doesn&#39;t seem real bad <br/>
now. But with 7 people in the house, it is a big deal when someone is sick. <br/>
Joseph and Sierra are very miserable sick kids. Joseph is actually worse <br/>
than Sierra. Sierra will just lay and sleep whereas he whines. The baby, <br/>
well no one wants to see a sick baby. If Tara gets sick we have to deal with <br/>
her missing school and work. If Joe gets sick, there goes the money. If I <br/>
get sick the house falls apart and if my mom gets sick, it&#39;s scary as she <br/>
always ends up with pnuemonia and at 77, that&#39;s not a good thing. That&#39;s why <br/>
this whole &quot;I won&#39;t take anything&quot; bothers us so much. So I also rubbed <br/>
Joseph and Sierra down with Vicks even though then don&#39;t like it. Joseph <br/>
actually took some nose spray I found for colds. I&#39;m hoping this will be <br/>
much better by morning. If not, I think I need to start thinking of <br/>
quarantining them away from each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810006054">We have found that the over the counter cold meds don&#39;t work very well <br/>
for us and we&#39;re trying other methods. This time around we used hot tea <br/>
with honey, herbal cough drops, cut out dairy (I learned from a scuba <br/>
diving friend that divers for certain kinds of dives don&#39;t eat dairy for <br/>
two weeks before because of mucus production - so when our colds or <br/>
allergies are bothering us, we cut way back on dairy and this really <br/>
helps). We have used the vaporizer, and all of this seems to have worked <br/>
just as well as the cold meds. Oh, and we aired out the house even <br/>
though it was cold and sent the kids out for some fresh air each day, <br/>
and this worked too. I went on my walk even though I didn&#39;t feel so <br/>
great and felt much better afterwards.<br/>

<br/>
Ok, here&#39;s my experience with these cold/flu kinda things.<br/>
Get everyone in the house on a blend of Echinacea/Reishi Mushroom/Astragulus <br/>
root immedietly.  It&#39;s available from Nature&#39;s Way which is at most Health <br/>
food stores.<br/>
Then you do an Acsorbic acid flush on the sick ones to get all the germs out <br/>
of their systems. You can mix the powder with juice for those that don&#39;t like <br/>
funny flavors. It&#39;s subtle, but obvious in water.<br/>
There are directions for an acsorbic acid flush in most alternative medicine <br/>
books (or probably online) but the measurements would depend on the size of <br/>
the person and how potent your acsorbic acid powder was.<br/>
Basically, it&#39;s high doses of vitamin C (only in the powder acsorbic acid <br/>
form) that causes your body to flush all toxins and germs. It goes into a <br/>
strong cleansing mode and is really great for your body. Some people do a <br/>
preventive flush once a month.<br/>
Garlic (acts as an antibiotic) and Cayenne supplements are really great when <br/>
you&#39;re sick also.<br/>
Those few herbs have kept us healthy or gotten us over an illness very <br/>
quickly.<br/>
We use homeopathics in addition, depending on the symptoms. <br/>
We also keep Charcoal tablets around for any stomache problems that may <br/>
arise. It will flush out germs quickly and keep you from having to be ill <br/>
when coming down with stomache flu. Miraculous stuff!<br/>
Some homeopathic remedies no parent should be without:<br/>
Arnica (both topical gel and pill form) for bruises<br/>
Pulsatilla for snotty green/yellow discharge, clinginess (wants to be held <br/>
all the time) weepy type colds<br/>
Belladonna for sudden fevers<br/>
Chammomilla for irritable, cranky or hyper<br/>
Ledum Palustra for puncture wounds<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot more, and one would need to take into account all symptoms to <br/>
find the proper remedy. But we&#39;ve done well with self diagnoses and <br/>
homeopathics, the arnica has saved my babies from some nasty bruises.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770057230">We have discovered children&#39;s Rhino echinacea.  A few dropperfuls in a glass<br/>
of orange juice does the trick and it tastes like.....plain old orange<br/>
juice.  My kids and I get lots of relief without a bad taste.<br/>
<br/>
I had quit taking any kind of cold or allergy medication because I hated<br/>
that foggy head feeling.  Natural &quot;medications&quot;  don&#39;t do that.  We have<br/>
also found our immune systems to be stronger.  In our group of friends just<br/>
about all are currently fighting bronchitis or strep throat.  These are<br/>
people we see almost daily.  None of my 5 kids are sick and this is the norm<br/>
for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my experience, with medicine, colds last 4 days, and without medicine,<br/>
colds last 4 days.  I know that you&#39;re trying to not have them spread around<br/>
your family, but that&#39;s really an issue of working on hygine rather than<br/>
meds.  Keep pushing the handwashing (get some of the no-water, rub-on<br/>
handcleanser stuff; kids seem to really go for that) and put a zillion boxes<br/>
of kleenix around your house.<br/>
<br/>
The drugs really don&#39;t help much.  I have finally realized that I&#39;m just not<br/>
very important in the grand scheme of things, and if I hang around the house<br/>
all day drinking lotsa juice, broth and water, and dozing on and off, I get<br/>
better faster.  Same with Tim.<br/>
<br/>
The prevention thing works best for us -- lots of fresh veggies and fruits<br/>
(Tim has been living on those nice little clementine oranges lately!),<br/>
plenty of sleep, naps if needed, and a little stress-management for Mom.<br/>
Works wonders; we&#39;ve all been blessedly healthy for about 9 months now.<br/>
After last winter, when I had strep 9 times before I had my tonsils out,<br/>
this is heaven!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sounds too easy, but has been working here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127315804">ANOTHER good argument for respecting kids, and unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m half getting it half not for <br/>
the past 3 days. The baby is the only one that was only sick a day. Tara is <br/>
immune. Tough kid. Poor Joseph is so sick of feeling like doing nothing he <br/>
wonders around the house just trying to figure out what he feels like doing. <br/>
Too sick to play yet tired of tv.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sorry I rambled, I hate having sick kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When kids are in school, faking illness is an art.  Being sick is desireable, <br/>
many times.  Test days, for instance.    Kids will lie and say &quot;fever&quot; and <br/>
try to crank thermometers up in various fashions.  Parents will be suspicious <br/>
of sickness.   When illness is confirmed by REAL fever, puking, etc., parents <br/>
think &quot;WHO will take care of this kid!?  Am I going to have to miss work?&quot; <br/>
and &quot;How many days of absence does this make?&quot; instead of &quot;Poor child feels <br/>
miserable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When kids are unschooled, there&#39;s no earthly reason to pretend to be ill.  <br/>
It&#39;s a crazy idea.  And they&#39;re never happy to be sick.  They think being <br/>
sick is sad and wrong.  Nobody will congratulate them for being ill.  They <br/>
can&#39;t believe that on sitcoms and in novels that kids are pretending to be <br/>
sick.<br/>
<br/>
So there.  That can be added to the lists of life improvements people didn&#39;t <br/>
expect to reap by unschooling.<br/>

Wow Sandra, you&#39;re doing that psychic thing again. Joe and I were just <br/>
talking about this a week or so ago. Tara had been working like crazy and <br/>
taking shifts from others on her days off. She came home one Sunday night <br/>
and asked if she could stay home on Monday and recover from her week. (there <br/>
goes my kids asking for things they know they can have)<br/>
Anyway, I made sure to tell Joe she was staying home so he wouldn&#39;t wake her <br/>
in the morning thinking she slept in. And he made the remark about how easy <br/>
I am, that he had to work very hard as a kid to stay home. Telling me about <br/>
the made up sickness&#39; and all. I even thought that was pretty funny because <br/>
my mom always let me stay home from school without even being sick. Just <br/>
because I didn&#39;t feel like it. It just gave me another insight on why Joe is <br/>
the way he is now. What an awful way to grow up.<br/>
<br/>

Oh my goodness, I just have to share.  One of our neighbor boys told us he faked being sick by dumping a can of refriend beans in the toilet and telling his mom he threw up.<br/>
