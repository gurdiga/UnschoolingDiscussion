4th of July message<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the <br/>
Declaration of Independence?Five signers were captured by the British <br/>
as traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes <br/>
ransacked and burned.  Two lost their sons serving in the <br/>
Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured.Nine of the 56 <br/>
fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War. <br/>
They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their <br/>
sacred honor. What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and <br/>
jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation <br/>
owners; men of means, well educated.  But they signed the Declaration <br/>
of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if <br/>
they were captured.<br/>
<br/>
 Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his <br/>
ships swept from the seas by the British Navy.  He sold his home and <br/>
properties to pay his debts, and died in rags. Thomas McKean was so <br/>
hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost <br/>
constantly.  He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was <br/>
kept in hiding.  His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was <br/>
his reward. Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, <br/>
Hall, Clymer,Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.<br/>
<br/>
At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr, noted that the British <br/>
General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his <br/>
headquarters.He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire.  <br/>
The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt. Francis Lewis had <br/>
his home and properties destroyed.  The enemy jailedhis wife, and she <br/>
died within a few months. John Hart was driven from his wife&#39;s bedside <br/>
as she was dying.  Their 13 children fled for their lives.  His fields <br/>
and his gristmill were laid to waste.  For more than a year he lived <br/>
in forests and caves, returning  home to find his wife dead and his <br/>
children vanished.  A few weeks later he died from exhaustion and a <br/>
broken heart.Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.  <br/>
<br/>
Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution.  <br/>
These were not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians.  They were <br/>
soft-spoken men of means and education.  They had security, but they <br/>
valued liberty more.  Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they <br/>
pledged:  &quot;For the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on <br/>
the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, <br/>
our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.&quot; They gave you and me a <br/>
free and independent America.  The history books  never told you a lot <br/>
about what happened in the Revolutionary War.  We didn&#39;t fight just <br/>
the British.  We were British subjects at that time and we fought our <br/>
own government!<br/>
<br/>
87 Years later, equally principled men met at a crossroads town in <br/>
Pennsylvania and sanctified that ground forever with blood shed in <br/>
defense of their principles.  Whatever your geographic or political <br/>
point of view, you cannot help but admire the courage and fortitude of <br/>
men like Joshua Chamberlain and Lew Armistead.  Gettysburg in 1863, <br/>
like Philadelphia in 1776, San Juan Hill in 1899, Midway Island in <br/>
1942, and Normandy in 1944, were all turning points in the course of <br/>
American history at which everyday Americans risked everything and <br/>
stood up to be counted.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us take our liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn&#39;t. <br/>
So, take a few minutes this year while enjoying your 4th of July <br/>
holiday and silently thank the patriots of the past.  It&#39;s not much to <br/>
ask for the price they paid.  Remember: freedom is never free!</div>
