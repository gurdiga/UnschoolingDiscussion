<div id="ygrps-yiv-732626994">I think I have listed these before.. but they are some family favorites.. <br/>
most of them are corny as del monte, but we still love them.. Most of them my <br/>
kids can quote just about word for word<br/>
<br/>
Raising Arizona.   <br/>
Johnny Dangerously  <br/>
The Dream Team<br/>
The first Batman. ( yeah, theres a trend here.. we love Michael Keaton)<br/>
The Money Pit<br/>
Big  (and we love Tom Hanks)<br/>
<br/>
 Anna and I love to watch Fried Green Tomatoes<br/>
<br/>
All the Monty Python stuff.. <br/>
OK.. I hate to admit this.. lol.. well, actually, its not me.  but Dh and my <br/>
boys love Benny Hill.. I bought dh a box set for Christmas one year<br/>
I also bought the entire season of Twin Peaks..  Dh and I LOVED it when it <br/>
first ran in the early 90s.. Landon and I watched the whole series.. that was <br/>
GREAT fun and wonderful time together.  It was the best &quot;cult&quot; TV series <br/>
ever.. better than Xfiles... (IMO)..  We are planning another &quot;Twin Peaks <br/>
Marathon&quot; this winter.. Anna wants to watch it all this time too, you have to <br/>
watch it closely and carefully.   Landon and I joined a Twin Peaks group on <br/>
yahoo thats been really interesting too.    We are movie freaks around here.. <br/>
We go to the movies at least once a week.. rent movies on .99 day.. and we <br/>
own close to 300.   We dont have cable  though.. but since the kids are home <br/>
now.. Im really considering getting it.<br/>

for Batman. I actually have his autograph on a poster that he drew for a film <br/>
festival at UVa (I thought that he&#39;d make it one day). My brush with fame. <br/>
Ha!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ahem.  These are &quot;old&quot; movies? *grin*  When I opened this I thought movies <br/>
like &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; would be in the list.  I think of these movies as <br/>
recent.<br/>
<br/>
I just introduced Lanora to Monty Python and she is in love.  I talked her <br/>
into watching &quot;The Bishop&#39;s Wife&quot; with me and she didn&#39;t expect to like it <br/>
but she did.<br/>
<br/>
I just got &quot;Daddy Longlegs&quot; at the library and next on the agenda is &quot;Born <br/>
Yesterday&quot;.<br/>
