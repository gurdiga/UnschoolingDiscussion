<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944043233">But all the experts who say phonics are the key to reading are<br/>
missing a piece.  My son knows the sound of every single letter, and<br/>
he recognizes by sight every single letter, and he simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
read.  So much for that theory.<br/>
*********************************8<br/>
<br/>
My daughter does the same thing!  She will be seven mid-may and is able to <br/>
read most of the first set of Bob Books.  She is aching to read.  She is my <br/>
child that wakes up everyday begging to do &quot;school work&quot;.  She&#39;s never once <br/>
been to school but she loves the concept, so we end up playing *school* <br/>
everyday.  She *wants* to sit and do work from a book and drools everytime <br/>
we go to the local homeshool book store.  She asks for every set of flash <br/>
cards, workbooks, kits, etc.  But she still isn&#39;t reading much.  She <br/>
struggles with hearing where sounds come in words...what is the middle sound <br/>
in cat...she will say c-c-c-c-cat...C!!!  We&#39;ve done every game possible <br/>
with sequencing, first, middle, last, etc. but it doesn&#39;t stick.  She can go <br/>
letter by letter and name every letter and offer it&#39;s sound but when she <br/>
sees them all together, she stammers.<br/>
<br/>
She talked at a pretty normal age so  don&#39;t think there is any correlation <br/>
there, but this child is very math/science oriented.  The concepts needed <br/>
for reading just haven&#39;t begun to stick yet.  (Although she can read every <br/>
word when needing to navigate PS2 games! &gt;bg&lt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think my point is that phonics isn&#39;t the straight arrow to reading, just <br/>
as whole language (sight reading) won&#39;t make a good reader either.  (My <br/>
oldest was taught using the whole language method in ps and struggled <br/>
beginning in third grade when BIG words came into the picture.)  Kids need <br/>
both and will generally seek out each in order to read on their own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733482466">Holly&#39;s reading now, but it didn&#39;t really click until she was ten, nearly <br/>
eleven. <br/>
<br/>
Last night when I was looking for a new book to read her I had to move a box <br/>
of flashcards and I brought them down too.  We used to go through those when <br/>
she really wanted to read, and I always hated the way they frustrated her and <br/>
just wanted to tell her &quot;Don&#39;t worry, wait,&quot; but she wanted to use whatever <br/>
&quot;tools&quot; we had.  <br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Hey, look!&quot; and I got them out and just kind of fanned through and <br/>
showed her words and she was reading them all fast and hard and laughing at <br/>
how much she knew, and the word &quot;eight&quot; came up and she just looked at it.<br/>
<br/>
That is a sight word if ever there was one, and for the same reason most of <br/>
them are.  It&#39;s a really old native English (Anglo-Saxon) word which was <br/>
written down long ago when it was pronounced differently, and preserved like <br/>
a bug in amber by the invention of the printing press.<br/>
<br/>
In context she would have been able to read it.  In isolation, it gives not <br/>
one clue to its own pronunciation except that it MIGHT have a &quot;t&quot; sound at <br/>
the end.<br/>
<br/>
But reading will come, and each child has to figure out his own way to get <br/>
around the exceptions because one size will never fit all no matter what paid <br/>
professional creaters of school materials wish and hope they will never find <br/>
a method that will match the mental organization of every child, and mental <br/>
organization is never inserted from outside.<br/>

(Although she can read every word when needing to navigate PS2 games! <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;bg&lt;)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Math/science oriented...L I have to laugh at my own self here. Since <br/>
I am not a math person, but very verbally oriented, and <br/>
quite &quot;intellectual,&quot; I&#39;ve been panicking about her reading, or lack <br/>
thereof,  when all along she&#39;s doing this &quot;round up&quot; thing. Like, for <br/>
instance, her consumer savvy is amazing. &quot;That says $6.99 but what it <br/>
means is $7.00&quot; !!! or doing math that I never &quot;taught&quot; to her, like <br/>
her figuring out how subtraction is the opposite of addition during <br/>
a &quot;Going To Do Math&quot; time in February. SO, here&#39;s my math wiz <br/>
daughter, which does impress me, but because she&#39;s not reading <br/>
Tolkien at age eight (as was my older girl), I think she&#39;s not doing <br/>
so well. <br/>
<br/>
Aaaargh! I need to de-school, don&#39;t I?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Navigating computer games&quot; LOL are we raising the same kid? Katie <br/>
can read words like &quot;location&quot; and &quot;suspect&quot; from a logic and math <br/>
computer game for 9-12 year olds, and finish the game without a <br/>
problem...but if I wrote &quot;location&quot; on a piece of paper, she would <br/>
not be able to read it.<br/>
<br/>
frustrating.<br/>
