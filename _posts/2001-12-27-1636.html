<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108193913">Man you guys have me laughing today!!!<br/>
The peeing on the chickens thing....oh my GOSH, it&#39;s a good thing I don&#39;t <br/>
drink anything near the computer!<br/>
It reminds me of a story my Mom read my boys called &quot;Harris and me&quot; by Gary <br/>
Paulsen....she has no hang ups about poop and pee jokes. In fact she&#39;s <br/>
usually the first to introduce weird, scary, funny and rude information to my <br/>
kids, which they love.<br/>
In the book, one of the boys pees on the electric fence....you can imagine <br/>
the humor in THAT!<br/>
From the stories my dh tells, I&#39;m quite sure that boys try peeing on a lot of <br/>
things I never dreamed of, including each other.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that the trick to keeping the toilet area clean is to teach boys <br/>
to sit down to pee. Yes, they really will....most of the time anyway. I&#39;m <br/>
sure that sounds strange, but they like to play gameboy or read so it works <br/>
well for all of us!! LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552231740">Thank you Ren - you wise woman! Yes, that makes sense. Let&#39;s make it a New Years resolution, I&#39;ll introduce that one to my boys. We&#39;ll see how it goes.....<br/>
