&lt;&lt;  He&#39;s the <br/>
 real McCoy, he&#39;s been there and done that. Most of the posters on the list <br/>
 are in the midst of unschooling, and might have benefited from his <br/>
 experience. Too bad, we&#39;ll never know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, many of us do know. We&#39;ve read Neds posts about his son over two <br/>
years ago at the message board, we&#39;ve met him in real life and discussed many <br/>
things with him. Several of the people here were on a discussion panel with <br/>
him, while others of us were in the audience. <br/>
If he would have stuck to his unschooling experience no one would have ever <br/>
complained, we LOVED those posts.<br/>
You weren&#39;t here, so what is your purpose in trying to stir things up that <br/>
happened before you were here?<br/>
I&#39;ve met Ned and enjoyed what he had to say, have you met him?<br/>
I enjoy learning from his unschooling wisdom, if only he&#39;d preached that I <br/>
never would have tired of his posts.<br/>
Ned is welcome to come back here anytime he wants, so how is he banned?<br/>
Are you reading any of the responses you&#39;ve been given?<br/>
Why oh why are you continuing to harp on this topic when everyone (including <br/>
the list owner) has answered your questions and tried to move ON!!??<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
