<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953623389">I know I am new here, therefore that makes my opinion fairly <br/>
lightweight overall...but I just had to post. <br/>
I have been lurking for almost a month, enjoy reading and have <br/>
learned alot -- but I don&#39;t ask my questions here, I either wait and <br/>
see if it comes up or I go elsewhere and ask.  No new person to this <br/>
board is going to brave these battle weary unschooling veterans in <br/>
arms to ask a simple question for fear of what the next post will say.<br/>
 &quot;Thats not an unschooling topic&quot;-- never direct, always later and <br/>
vague OR  &quot;HOW could you think that way...&quot; OR &quot;WHAT are you <br/>
SAYING&quot;...  and so on, you get my drift. To be here comfortably you <br/>
must be an unschooler from birth and have had no other opinion ever <br/>
about life or (gasp)schooling. ~~forgive the dripping sarcasm~~<br/>
 I, personally, enjoy  the various views whether I agree or not and <br/>
(mistakenly) thought the point of such a board as this was to support <br/>
people on the journey of life; I thought unschooling was about a <br/>
lifestyle not a school style...obviously ,newbie that I am, I was <br/>
wrong(at least for this board). I am regretful of this opinion <br/>
because I think there are many people on this board I could learn <br/>
from,( and DO in spite of themselves) could garner information and <br/>
support from-- but darn it all I&#39;m not asking here, it&#39;s just not the <br/>
right forum for questions about parenting and life--only unschooling. <br/>
(lol, SEE??? That is ridiculous, but it&#39;s the vibe being given in my <br/>
opinion) <br/>
I feel this was a necessary public post, I think those who have &#39;been <br/>
there, done that&#39; have so much to offer and should know that it is <br/>
being wasted right now. Either you are the quiet not posting ones or <br/>
the ones we&#39;re wary of. Normally,I feel good about expressing my <br/>
opinion  in life at anytime, but I also have received a few private <br/>
emails of newbies expressing such opinions so I&#39;m taking it upon <br/>
myself to share for all-- lol admittedly taking heat in other words.<br/>
Please don&#39;t post rash, heated public replies to this  in attempts <br/>
to &quot;correct&quot; my opinion, I am merely expressing it and don&#39;t wish to <br/>
inflame the board, just let you pillars of support know that your <br/>
effectiveness is lacking in reaching those with questions...we&#39;re <br/>
not &#39;afraid&#39; to ask, we just don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the hassle and we <br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;ll listen, just lash out at what you disagree with.<br/>
And please don&#39;t say &#39;not all of us are that way&#39; ...where are those <br/>
of you that aren&#39;t :0) Why are you not saying  ~~ahem, newbies, don&#39;t <br/>
be shy, it&#39;s okay~~ lol<br/>
Okay I&#39;m done...all that said -- WHOOOHOOOOO I AM SOOOO EXCITED TO BE <br/>
UNSCHOOLING AND OUR LIFE IS A HAPPY FULFILLING ONE :0)-- Any and all <br/>
private emails are welcome!!</div>

questions, please please please! email Joyce or Helen and talk to them about<br/>
it, that&#39;s what they are here for!  It will probably be more effective in<br/>
finding a way to help you then side conversations about how this list isn&#39;t<br/>
helping.<br/>
    I&#39;ve been unschooling for three years and it took me 2 of those years to<br/>
find the lists that I am on today and that are so helpful to me. It&#39;s okay<br/>

Hi!  Do you want to hear an alternate view from a  relatvie newbie? lol! ...I am a new poster to the list, just these last couple of weeks. I joined the list in January and have spent that time reading the emails, learning, listening, thinking - and being with my kids... Being on several email lists, I feel it is important for me to get a feel for a list - so I wouldn&#39;t post anything until I felt I had something to say/share/ask.This is just what works for me in email lists :-)...I am entirely comfortable with this list - I like the mix  of posts and posters - and , as a newbie, I have felt welcomed...Leonie W. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your observation is a common one. To put it in perspective, though, the<br/>
observation that debate is the necessary life blood of the list is equally<br/>
common.<br/>
<br/>
I too am uncomfortable asking for people&#39;s opinions on my thoughts -- just<br/>
about anywhere, not just here. I think it&#39;s because what I want in return is<br/>
support for the conclusion I&#39;ve come to. I don&#39;t like holding myself up to<br/>
public examination. I get the feeling people are saying &quot;How can you<br/>
possibly believe that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I do know that examining what I believe and why I believe it is how I&#39;ve<br/>
grown and changed. I know that too much of what I was comfortable with and<br/>
was certain I was right about is not so true when held up to critical and<br/>
objective examination. There&#39;s just been too much stuff in my life that<br/>
society gets us to believe is right and true that turns out to be just a<br/>
matter of preventing things we fear will happen, or purely for a matter of<br/>
convenience (usually the convenience of adults). (I mean, who in their right<br/>
mind would question the rightness of 3 meals a day? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It throws you off kilter to let go of those things that -- objectively<br/>
looking at it -- mostly make life easier for us adults.<br/>
<br/>
(So maybe it helps to read the statements that come across as &quot;Here&#39;s the<br/>
right way to think&quot; as &quot;If you look at it from this perspective, your world<br/>
view is going to change.&quot; It&#39;s like having looked at the rear end of the<br/>
statue without realizing there&#39;s a front end. The rear end isn&#39;t &quot;wrong&quot; but<br/>
it&#39;s not the whole picture and you won&#39;t ever look at the rear end the<br/>
same.)<br/>
<br/>
People are different. Some prefer the gentle approach. Some prefer a more<br/>
direct approach. I suspect there are more gentle unschooling lists than<br/>
there are ones that ask people to question their assumptions. This happens<br/>
to be of the latter type. And unfortunately though those who like the direct<br/>
approach can coexist with the gentle approach. Those who prefer the gentle<br/>
approach find it very uncomfortable to coexist with the more direct<br/>
appraoch. There isn&#39;t an easy answer to that that will make everyone happy.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it does make a lot of people uncomfortable. And, yes, the wording comes<br/>
across as *very* harsh to some ears. It does help to read as though your<br/>
best friend, someone who truly cares about you, were saying the words in a<br/>
gentle tone. Because though we hear a tone in our heads it isn&#39;t there on<br/>
the screen. We&#39;re supplying that tone. It might be because it resembles some<br/>
harsh language used to us as children. Or some other reason.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also helpful to keep in mind that people are sincerely trying to help<br/>
in the way they feel is best. How people offer their help to us is not ours<br/>
to control. (After all we&#39;re asking them to take time out of their lives to<br/>
offer us free help!)<br/>
<br/>
(And yes, I am aware some see Ned in that category. You may write to me or<br/>
Helen about it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that doesn&#39;t help at all. :-/ I just want you to know that<br/>
just because things don&#39;t change doesn&#39;t mean no one understands. It&#39;s just<br/>
that there isn&#39;t an easy answer. It *seems* like there is an easy answer:<br/>
everyone should just be nicer. But when you realize everyone *is* being nice<br/>
and is voluntarily offering their help in the way they know best, then the<br/>
answer isn&#39;t so simple.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As another newbie here&#39;s my view:  I started posting after reading some <br/>
archives and a couple of days posts...its not in my nature to lurk.  I always <br/>
have an opinion :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read many things on this list that have made me uncomfortable but I view <br/>
that as a good thing.  I&#39;m free to take or leave the advice given...but I <br/>
figure I have a lot to learn and who better to learn from than those who have <br/>
done it for a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
My very first post was the one about my boys being &quot;spoiled rotten.&quot;  I&#39;ll <br/>
admit than when Sandra posted the link to her article and I read it I was a <br/>
bit miffed.  After all, I don&#39;t truly believe they are spoiled.  But after <br/>
reflecting on it I realized that choosing your wording is important.  I <br/>
actually then forwarded the article to my mom because we had a discussion <br/>
about kids being &quot;spoiled&quot; these days a few weeks ago.  It was a learning <br/>
tool for me and my mom.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, another post (Sandra again I think) talked about the ghost <br/>
structure of school in my life.  I&#39;ve been thinking about that now...at first <br/>
I dismissed it.  Afte all, they are young so why should I think about it.  <br/>
But then I thought about it more.  My IRL friends have a profound influence <br/>
on me and the fact that they are so obsessed with the &quot;proper&quot; education for <br/>
their children makes me feel defensive and unsure.  I&#39;m still &quot;grading&quot; <br/>
myself by what I should do rather than what is best for my family.  I&#39;m <br/>
afraid I&#39;ll make a mistake and ruin the boys for life (no matter how <br/>
unrational that may sound.)  (I do have a really great story about this <br/>
though...for another post!)<br/>
<br/>
My point is (and I do have one):  if this list were not so challanging I may <br/>
not have gotten the chance to challange myself.  I can still disagree but if <br/>
I find something that may be useful...a different way of looking at things <br/>
perhaps...then I&#39;ll be better for it.  That will benefit my children.<br/>
<br/>
The only concern I&#39;ve had so far is that someone would think I didn&#39;t belong <br/>
because my kids aren&#39;t &quot;school&quot; aged yet.  I was a little defensive on <br/>
that...but now that I understand better even that is gone. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Being uncomfortable is unpleasant but I don&#39;t feel as though I&#39;m being <br/>
attacked or take it personally.  I love it when someone refers me to a link <br/>
or website that I may not have seen before...even though for the poster it <br/>
may feel like the same old stuff. I feel that I can ask any question I <br/>
want...but just as I don&#39;t have to take their (meaning those who have been <br/>
here a long time) advice...they don&#39;t have to agree with me either.<br/>

Wait.  How could it possibly be helpful when Ned said (approximately)<br/>
that the contents of this list are pablum if the list isn&#39;t actively<br/>
discussing revolutionary politics?  Fighting the system MIGHT someday be<br/>
helpful, but it&#39;s untrue that every other form of help is inadequate.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think Ned&#39;s sweeping insults and his contempt for the typical<br/>
forms of discussion we have here were helpful to the list at all. He ran<br/>
roughshod over discussion here with the intention of damaging it because<br/>
he had contempt for it (and us as day to day mothers).  In summary, I<br/>
think Ned was harmful, not helpful.  Why would anyone welcome that type<br/>
of behavior?<br/>

<br/>
Another point on that, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent much of the week embroiled in SCA matters.  Two former kings I <br/>
know pretty well.  One (A) asking me for advice.  The other (B) had told him <br/>
that when he/A was king that people seemed  happy to do what he said.  A <br/>
pointed out that he simply had never asked them to do things they didn&#39;t <br/>
already want to do.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the tale of the king commanding the sun to rise?<br/>
<br/>
If you do it at just the right time, it can work out pretty dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
We live near the foothills of some mountains, and I can make the moon back <br/>
down in the east sometimes just by driving toward my house.  One night we <br/>
watched the moon rise three times just driving back and forth on the same <br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
So someone can SEEM to have the list revolve around her own personal needs, <br/>
or her own orbit IF she keeps these things in mind:<br/>
<br/>
 Description    <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>
need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>
facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>
enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>
how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>
about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions <br/>
about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll (<br/>
fetteroll@...)<br/>
<br/>
This list and the Unschooling.com site were created and are still supported <br/>
