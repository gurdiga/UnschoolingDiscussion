I&#39;m afraid of sewing machine, too.<br/>

&gt; Hey, Kelly!  Can we have a sewing-machines-for-terrified-people session at<br/>
&gt; the unschooling conference and Sandra can teach us how to thread machines<br/>
&gt; and work bobbins? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Laughing &#39;til tears run out of my eyes! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid of them too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I got mine as a birthday present from Ben the first year we were married. I <br/>
figured out how to thread the thing. I could load a bobbin. I never made <br/>
clothes with it, but I used it to make curtains and pillows, etc---household <br/>
things. For about 7 years. <br/>
<br/>
Mine became crooked somewhere along the line (maybe all those military <br/>
moves?), and the needle hits the foot. And breaks off. AND HITS ME JUST LEFT <br/>
OF MY RIGHT EYE!!! I freaked the first time, and bought a new needle. It did <br/>
it again, (freakier!), so I bought another. After the third time, I put the <br/>
SOB in the box and back in the closet. I haven&#39;t brought &quot;The Blinder&quot; out <br/>
since.<br/>
<br/>
I never got really good at it, but I was OK. My mother is an incredible <br/>
seamstress---she made my wedding gown and the boys&#39; christening gown (along <br/>
with most of my dresses when I was a child). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a neat thing to be able to do, ....but can I recommend......STITCH <br/>
WTICHERY???<br/>
