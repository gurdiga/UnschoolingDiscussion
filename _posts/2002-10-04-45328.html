&gt; &gt; it is my dd that is the vegan.<br/>
&gt; &gt; she might be able to help- she has just moved and started a new job so<br/>
&gt; &gt; her computer is not hooked up yet. I do know that she uses the<br/>
&gt; &gt; interent ALOT for recipes, etc. Personally, I&#39;m sure someone here will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a different opinion- and my dd has a different opinion! But, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would not &#39;do&#39;a  vegan&#39; diet with growing children..... I have spoken<br/>
&gt; &gt; to quite a few nutritionists -who may have been vegan themselves- but<br/>
&gt; &gt; cautioned against a vegan diet for kids. You&#39;ll have your work cut out<br/>
&gt; &gt; for you doing some research. here&#39;s a start:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; A vegan diet is fine for growing children. My three have been vegan<br/>
&gt; from birth and are all tall, slim and healthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a number of books by Micheal Kapler (I&#39;m guessing his last<br/>
&gt; name cos I can&#39;t find the damn book now) about raising a child as<br/>
&gt; a vegan. He&#39;s an American MD.<br/>
&gt; There isn&#39;t anything a plant based diet cannot supply.<br/>
&gt; Of course, vegan diets can be unhealthy like meat based diets.<br/>
&gt; Eating fries and tortilla chips al day wouldn&#39;t be a good thing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Does being vegan mean you can&#39;t take supplements? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And my point was you can&#39;t get everything from simply eating a plant based <br/>
diet. My point was you have to supplement or you could become ill.<br/>
