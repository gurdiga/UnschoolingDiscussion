<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255164291">A couple of things we did to make learning the math tables fun was Giant<br/>
Step Relay and Throw Daddy in the Pool Math.<br/>
<br/>
In Giant Step Relay, we take the children to the park and split into teams.<br/>
We have 4 children but two of them are two young to actually play so they<br/>
just pretend.  Two of us line up at one end of a &quot;lane&quot; far enough away to<br/>
make it last a bit but close enough so we do not have to shout.  Then each<br/>
of us ask our team mate a multiplication question.  When they answer<br/>
correctly, they take a giant step forward and ask the other person a<br/>
multiplication question.  And you get the idea.  The best way to encourage<br/>
an activity is to make it fun and to have immediate, positive reinforcement<br/>
at each step if possible, and at the end of the activity.  Our reinforcement<br/>
comes in the form of support and fun during the activity and then the<br/>
children can choose there favorite play activity for me and / or my wife to<br/>
participate with them in.  They love the interactive fun and the fact that<br/>
we participate with in the math part.  You should just seem their self<br/>
directed study when they know we are going to the park the net day to play<br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
Throw Daddy in the Pool Math can be used with any math and we use it for<br/>
areas that are practical that they are having trouble on.  Sometimes they<br/>
will have trouble getting 6 * 4 or some similar problem.  We remember this<br/>
and when we take a swim I will spontaneously ask them the problem.  If they<br/>
get it right, they get to push me in the pool.  (Sometimes I think they<br/>
sandbag :-)  They keep asking eagerly, &quot;Daddy ask me my math!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
These are just a couple of examples we have used.  But guess what... they<br/>
nail their math tables!<br/>
<br/>

The title alone sells the idea.  A winner!<br/>
