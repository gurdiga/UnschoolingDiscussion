<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081995869">I don&#39;t remember the exact name, but they carry a certain bacteria that because of young children&#39;s immature immune systems can cause sickness and even, in some cases, death. I THINK I remember that the biggest risk of it came from their droppings, and they are the biggest risk for children under the age of 4. They usually freak out when you first get them, it takes them about a week to settle in. After that, if you put your hands in the cage as often as possible, he&#39;ll get used to you very quickly. They can tell the difference between different people, so everyone in the family will need to do this. They are a joy to own!!! I&#39;ve had two. <br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m sorry, I asked Tyler, and he wants us to keep the hamster stuff for his next little fuzzy critter. We looked at the guinea pigs, but they were too big for his taste. We had the miniature (dwarf?) hamsters before, and he doesn&#39;t want anything bigger than they were. <br/>

  My son would love an iguana....what have you heard about  not being in a<br/>
  family with small children? how small is small?  My bil had one years ago<br/>
  and it was very sedate. vegetarian and did little more than sit.<br/>
    Myranda.....um....you wouldn&#39;t be interested in selling your hamster<br/>
  stuff would you? we are looking for some.<br/>
    have you thought of a guinea pig? they can be really sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343420938">could it have been salmonella? I did hear that iguanas continue to grow<br/>
all of their lives so in a number of years you could be purchasing a<br/>
cattle tank (like for water) to keep it in. I thought that perhaps a pet<br/>
that didn&#39;t get so big would be better. A ferret, sugar glider, a dog (of<br/>
course not a great dane *grin*).<br/>
  your cage sounds like a habitrail....they are really neat. hamsters<br/>
seem to be more watching pets than handling ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790916862">That may be it! Iguanas will get huge eventually given enough room and a good diet, but if you keep them in smaller cages they will stay smaller longer, sometimes forever. For example, the one we had was 5 years old and only about 18 inches long, he had been kept in a 30 gallon aquarium for his entire life. My uncle has a 2 yr old one that is now well over 3 feet long, he built a 6 ft high cage that was 3&#39;x3&#39;, and put in 4 levels I believe, and a tree branch. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;d call the cage. I got the bird-cage part when we bought the hamsters, then added the other pieces on from stuff bought at Wal-Mart. <br/>

It&#39;s Salmonella. Which makes them not a good pet for young children.<br/>
If you get bitten, it can be very difficult for the wound to heal.<br/>
