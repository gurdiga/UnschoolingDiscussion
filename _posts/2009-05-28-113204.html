<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086938901">No, the Northeast Unschooling Conference doesn&#39;t have an  organized Whale <br/>
Watch this year, BUT there&#39;s an amazing opportunity if your  family would <br/>
like to see the whales. You have an opportunity to buy tickets for  a great <br/>
company, Cape Ann Whale Watch, for less than half price! Tickets  are usually <br/>
$45, and you can get them today for $20 each. <br/>
 <br/>
Groupon is a collective buying group, offering great discounts on cool  <br/>
things. (They also write the funniest descriptions I&#39;ve ever seen.) If you want <br/>
 tickets, you have until midnight tonight (Thursday) to get them. The <br/>
tickets are  good for the whole 2009 season. You do NOT have to register for the <br/>
conference  for this.<br/>
 <br/>
Go to: _http://groupon.thepoint.com/_ (http://groupon.thepoint.com/)   If  <br/>
you decide to do it, please let me know. If there&#39;s interest in this kind of <br/>
 thing I&#39;d be happy to post other stuff as it comes up.<br/>
