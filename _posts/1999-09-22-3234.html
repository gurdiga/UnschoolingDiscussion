<div id="ygrps-yiv-159654920">i too have noticed a happier attitude in my kids since informing them that they<br/>
were unschooling now! at first they freaked and thought they would be dumb if i<br/>
didnt tell them what to do. now, especially my son, there is an ease, my mom<br/>
noticed it too. right now my son is out practising what he&#39;s read. he devoured<br/>
all the old back issues of outdoor life, yesterday bought a hunter orange vest,<br/>
and today is out hunting game birds. what freedom for him.<br/>
dd is into fixing up my old dool house my dad made me for my 7th birthday. it is<br/>
an exact replica of the old log house we lived in. she&#39;s redecorating it. its<br/>
real cute to watch her enthusiasm.<br/>
ok i&#39;m braging today, it&#39;s just one of those days i feel very comfortable.<br/>
next week i might have an attack, but i feel im getting more comfortable as i<br/>
seee my kids follow thier interests and be happy in learning!<br/>

&gt;     I would like to thank everyone for their feedback! I was just in need of<br/>
&gt; some assurance. I guess it&#39;s that public school brainwashing whispering in my<br/>
&gt; ear!! I have noticed a marked improvement in my children since I have changed<br/>
&gt; to an unschooling approach! And even on days when all they do is play with<br/>
&gt; legos, they are happier than ever before!! I suppose that is of the greatest<br/>
&gt; importance anyway!! So, the panic attack is over and I feel at peace with my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s process of learning once again!  Blessings, Lori in TX<br/>

Write down how you feel right now,  save it somewhere,  and then the <br/>
next time the panic hits ( and it will hit again),  you&#39;ll be all set <br/>
to reassure yourself.  We all panic now and then.  I&#39;m glad your kids <br/>
are doing so well.  Can&#39;t underestimate the importance of being <br/>
happy.  I talked to a good friend today whose 7th grade daughter is <br/>
saying every day,  &quot;I hate school.&quot;  and  &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to <br/>
school.&quot;  It&#39;s only 6 weeks or so into the school year - sad :-(<br/>
