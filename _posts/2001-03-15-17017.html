<div id="ygrps-yiv-262213058">Hooo boy - that&#39;s a reach back in time.. hmmm If I&#39;m remembering correctly,<br/>
we used push pins in the top corners and a couple more along the top<br/>
strategically to keep it straight, and then we taped the pics to each other,<br/>
rather than to the wall. I&#39;m gonna guess we did the same down the sides<br/>
(strategic push pins) to keep it close to the wall. It did less damage (push<br/>
pin hole wise) than the traditional posters that adorn college dorm walls<br/>
cuz the pins were all along the edges of the wall near the corners. The<br/>
collage was made up of mostly magazine pictures and captions cut into<br/>
different shapes and then taped together.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; (it was removable without damaging the<br/>
&gt; wall considering the wall was only on loan...) and it was great fun and we<br/>
&gt; really enjoyed looking at it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What did you use that made it removable? For future reference.<br/>
