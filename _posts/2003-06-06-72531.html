&gt; &gt;the teacher called on me and I happily said, &quot;Mrs. Stewart, I have <br/>
&gt; to go now, my <br/>
&gt; &gt;mom has an appontiment for a Blow Job.&quot; I asked my mom,&quot;Why is <br/>
&gt; everyone so weird about you <br/>
&gt; &gt;getting a blow job on your car?&quot; She said, &quot;What?&quot; I said, &quot;Mommy, <br/>
&gt; you said <br/>
&gt; &gt;you needed a blow job this morning.&quot; She started laughing <br/>
&gt; hysterically and tears <br/>
&gt; &gt;ran down her cheeks. &gt;Rhonda<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, how about this one? Not as a little child, mind you, but a <br/>
&gt; grown woman, I said this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We buy our frozen stuff from Schwan&#39;s, a door to door delivery <br/>
&gt; service. I was telling the Schwan&#39;s man what we&#39;d need &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
&gt; need two broccoli, a California blend...Oh, and I&#39;d better take a <br/>
&gt; pea.&quot; And my daughter started laughing before I realized what i had <br/>
&gt; said! LOL <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was in college a friend of mine came to dinner at the cafeteria having <br/>
given blood, and was wearing a sticker. I, in my perky, idiotic manner, said <br/>
enthusiastically, &quot;Oh, you have a heart on!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I stood there confused as several tables around us were falling on the floor <br/>
laughing. Didn&#39;t get it until someone actually explained it to me.<br/>
