<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229452949">Im pretty sure theres an entire chapter on LDs in Teach Your Own. Dont<br/>
know how available that book is now. Pat Farenga (at Holt Assoc.) told me<br/>
recently that hes got a contract to revise the book for a new edition<br/>
(because so much of the legal info is way out of date).<br/>
<br/>
John also writes about LDs in Never Too Late, which was his book about<br/>
learning to play the cello late in life (around 50?). He describes a<br/>
situation in which he was under a lot of stress during a music lesson and<br/>
suddenly experienced what was once called word blindness (and later called<br/>
dyslexia), only with notes instead of words.<br/>
<br/>
He describes the notes jumping around on the score, and then says something<br/>
like, It wasnt just that I couldnt read the notes. It was as if I had<br/>
never seen such a thing as a note ever before in my life, and could make no<br/>
sense of their purpose or place in the world in any way. (Im very much<br/>
paraphrasing here, but thats the spirit of it.)<br/>
<br/>
He then says that he imagines that reading, for a person for whom it is<br/>
difficult, must be like that awful sensation, when youre under stress, in<br/>
which you keep looking up a phone number again and again in the space of<br/>
seconds, unsure youll be able to dial it from memory.<br/>
<br/>
Ive just looked in the index of Learning All the Time and found a couple of<br/>
short references to LDs. One reads, in part, Some years ago, at a large<br/>
conference of specialists in learning disability, I asked whether anyone had<br/>
ever heard of  not done, but merely heard of  any research linking<br/>
so-called perceptual handicaps with stress. In the audience of about 1,100,<br/>
two hands were raised. One man told me then, the other told me later, about<br/>
research that showed that when students with supposedly severe learning<br/>
disabilities were put in a relatively stress-free situation, their<br/>
disabilities soon vanished. (No, he doesnt give any citation for the<br/>
research, at least not in this passage.)<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, Holt Assoc. published a booklet titled Everyone Is Able. I was<br/>
one of the contributors  I wrote about how I didnt learn to tell time<br/>
until I was 12. I was a straight-A student almost every year, all the way<br/>
through school. I just couldnt tell time, and I was so ashamed I went<br/>
through all sorts of contortions (described in the booklet) to keep anyone<br/>
from finding out.<br/>
<br/>
Its kind of spoiling the punchline to tell you what happened in the end,<br/>
but Ill tell you anyway since I dont even know whether the booklet is<br/>
still available: I finally figured out, after somehow learning on my own how<br/>
to tell time, that the problem must have stemmed from the cardboard clock my<br/>
first-grade teacher had used to teach us. Back then, I had told time with<br/>
the best of them. Well, guess what? She must have been putting the hour hand<br/>
precisely on top of the number, instead of somewhere between two numbers. On<br/>
a real clock my problem was how to figure out whether it was 1:20 or 2:20,<br/>
for example.<br/>
<br/>
Im just telling you about this because, while I may believe a little more<br/>
than John did that there are some people with some microscopic glitch in the<br/>
brain that makes learning to read (or whatever) difficult, I agree with him<br/>
that there are nowhere near as many real cases of this as the schools would<br/>
have us believe. Part of the overdiagnosing has to do with there being more<br/>
Federal funding for disabled students. Part of it is the schools<br/>
insistence on seeing intellectual endeavor as something that is completely<br/>
devoid of emotions, and on rarely looking at the teaching from the point of<br/>
view of the students. Stress, bad teaching materials, etc. arent even<br/>
looked into as a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
I think John might also have come around to thinking that glitches did<br/>
sometimes exist if hed been around for all the studies about victims of<br/>
stroke or head injury losing extremely specific abilities, like the use of<br/>
verbs or of nouns. (Oliver Sachs book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A<br/>
Hat comes to mind.)<br/>
<br/>
But I still think the place to start in any individual case is with stress,<br/>
both because its more likely to be that and because we dont yet know what<br/>
to do about the physical glitches.<br/>
<br/>
If theres an 11-year-old whos obviously upset about her lack of reading<br/>
ability, and shes coming to her mother every night with a book and getting<br/>
even more upset about the fact that, after reading it aloud successfully,<br/>
shes turning it over and finding that its way below her grade level,<br/>
then (given that there doesnt seem to be an operation or a pill, or even a<br/>
particularly effective teaching technique for dyslexics) the focus should<br/>
probably be on reducing the level of stress shes feeling. She isnt going<br/>
to learn ANYTHING useful in that state.<br/>
<br/>
How to reduce the stress, I dont know, but it does occur to me that there<br/>
is one section in the library where none of the books are labelled as to<br/>
grade level  the adult section. How about telling her youd rather read<br/>
aloud to her than listen to her read? Absolutely no stress. She curls up and<br/>
looks at the page (or not) as you read, and she picks up, in time, something<br/>
more about reading than she would by struggling syllable by syllable through<br/>
a book meant for first graders.<br/>
<br/>
I never understood the point of having beginning readers read aloud, anyway.<br/>
The non-fluent readers in my school were always the ones who, when asked to<br/>
read silently at their desks, could be observed moving their lips. I think<br/>
silent reading comes first, and only once its fluent, should the reader<br/>
read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
If you already read aloud to your daughter, Sarah, or if shes vehemently<br/>
insisting on reading aloud, just disregard this. I do think its sometimes<br/>
helpful to bring in someone from outside the family to help, but not if that<br/>
will just add to the stress.<br/>
<br/>
How Children Fail is, in a way, entirely about LDs. Look for the part<br/>
about how John refrained from putting together words (from letter cards<br/>
meant to teach reading) for the kids he was tutoring to read to him.<br/>
Instead, he asked them to put together words for HIM to read  which<br/>
resulted in a lot of words that were hard for him to pronounce (like<br/>
zzftkql), and a lot of laughter, and gave the kids complete freedom from<br/>
making mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, at 37, has recently been DELIGHTED to be diagnosed as ADD.<br/>
Hah. But thats another story.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long sentences. Dont have time to rework them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540848101">Thanks,  Elsa,  you are amazing!  What a thorough and considerate response!!<br/>
I *do* think in my dd&#39;s case,  a lot of her problem pertains to stress.  I<br/>
believe that,  though I never intended it and did it unconsciously,  I have<br/>
pressured her academically.  She is my oldest child....I have grown and<br/>
learned immensely,  but admit I used to place too much emphasis on the<br/>
importance of academics.  She spoke early and was considered a brilliant<br/>
pre-schooler......big deal!  I&#39;m still trying to figure out everything i&#39;ve<br/>
done to stress her out....<br/>
Of late, (past year or so),  I&#39;ve been much more able to &#39;let it go&#39;....put<br/>
my faith in her.  She is gradually taking small steps in reading.  I<br/>
continue to &#39;breathe deeply&#39;  and try to simply *be there* for her<br/>
questions.  She loves books...her favorite things to check out from the<br/>
library are books on tape....she can certainly follow complicated plot<br/>
lines...and I&#39;ve decided to just enjoy her &#39;thinking&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
She recently listened to &quot;A wrinkle In Time&quot;....her critique was not only<br/>
aling plot and charater lines,  but she actually commented on the narrator&#39;s<br/>
&#39;voice&#39; abilities!<br/>
<br/>
Susan ....who *loves* The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat&quot;  and still<br/>
thinks a career in psychoneurobiology would be fun!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s an entire chapter on &quot;LD&#39;s&quot; in Teach Your Own. Don&#39;t<br/>
know how available that book is now. Pat Farenga (at Holt Assoc.) told me<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800994181">Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
I never actually met John (he died some months before I started working at<br/>
Holt Associates), so though I think I remember having seen photos of him<br/>
wearing those typical middle-age reading glasses, I cant be sure.<br/>
<br/>
But the passage in Never Too Late I was referring to makes very clear that<br/>
this was a sudden change in his perception of the notes, brought on by<br/>
unusual stress (he had arrived late for the music lesson, the teacher was<br/>
annoyed, he was already worried about something else to begin with,<br/>
whatever). So any speculations about whether he wore glasses or had a<br/>
vision problem seem to me slightly beside the point.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else on this list said not long ago that the body and the mind are<br/>
one, in the sense that, for example, stress is both an emotional and a<br/>
physical phenomenon (you feel stress, stress hormones circulate, muscles<br/>
tense, you feel more stressed, etc.) Eyesight is one of those things that<br/>
seem to be especially vulnerable to stress.<br/>
<br/>
I got my first pair of glasses at age eleven (though, looking back, I had<br/>
probably needed them long before that). At first I wore them only to see the<br/>
blackboard or a movie screen, then also for the TV, and eventually at all<br/>
times. In my twenties, I tried to get rid of them after reading a book<br/>
called Better Vision Without Glasses (or Better Eyesight  Im not sure<br/>
of the title).<br/>
<br/>
The idea behind the book, as I remember it (I may have some of this mixed up<br/>
by now) is that myopia (nearsightedness) is not due to a permanent<br/>
congenital defect consisting of an abnormally elongated eyeball (which<br/>
causes the image to fall short of the retina), as optometrists would have<br/>
you believe, but to an incorrect use of the muscles that support the<br/>
eyeball, which can temporarily change its shape.<br/>
<br/>
The book explained that myopia is caused by staring  by not taking in the<br/>
whole scene through very rapid, fluid movements of the eyes in and out of<br/>
the distance while blinking frequently, but instead fixating on a single<br/>
point and straining to see it without much blinking at all. There were<br/>
exercises that supposedly could help you get rid of your glasses even after<br/>
years of using them.<br/>
<br/>
I tried the exercises, but they made my eyes hurt. So I ditched them and<br/>
just started to take my glasses off unless I really needed them. (I really<br/>
needed them a lot  I would take them off and proceed down the sidewalk,<br/>
then put them back on to cross it.) After some days or weeks of this (I don<br/>
t remember which) I found myself able to read the name of the Metro station<br/>
on the wall (this was in Madrid) from inside the train.<br/>
<br/>
Later, I became able to read a street sign from across the street. I was<br/>
absolutely amazed. It was inconvenient to be using my glasses so sparingly,<br/>
though, so sometime later I gave up on the experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Im explaining all this because I think it means that vision is not<br/>
static, and that a vision problem is not necessarily something that just<br/>
happens to you for some inexplicable genetically-based reason.<br/>
<br/>
In Never Too Late, John also talks about how, when stress hormones<br/>
circulate, peripheral vision becomes limited. This seems to make sense  we<br/>
may have evolved to focus (literally) on the most urgent problem right in<br/>
front of us, and not waste brain cell power worrying about things off to<br/>
either side.<br/>
<br/>
You know how, when youre about to be run over by a truck (or whatever) time<br/>
freezes and you zero in on some tiny, insignificant detail? Well, if you<br/>
feel threatened by the printed page and your field of vision becomes<br/>
severely constricted, you might start reading letter-by-letter instead of<br/>
making relaxed use of the surrounding text. (The eyes of fluent readers dart<br/>
all over the page as they read  I know mine do.)<br/>
<br/>
Is this a purely physical problem, to be solved by glasses? Maybe not. Would<br/>
an optometrist be able to diagnose a vision problem in your daughter? Maybe<br/>
its like the way its hard for doctors to get blood pressure readings that<br/>
mean much of anything, because a lot of peoples blood pressures shoot up on<br/>
any visit to the doctors office, and because blood pressure varies<br/>
according to the time of day, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to test or correct - maybe only treatable through stress reduction.<br/>
Biofeedback? Soothing music? Or just not having your daughter participate in<br/>
any reading aloud, or in anything else that puts her under stress about her<br/>
reading ability?<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in a previous post the enormous difference between a word game<br/>
in which the student is reading aloud words the teacher puts together from<br/>
letter cards, and one in which the student puts together the words, be they<br/>
pronounceable or not, and the teacher has to try to read them, amid laughter<br/>
(zzftlqt, bnxtuvsql).<br/>
<br/>
In the former case, the student is under pressure, whether you keep score,<br/>
or give a grade, or call it a game, or not. In the second case, there is<br/>
no pressure  only the opportunity for the student to make his or her own<br/>
discoveries  since the teacher has no way of evaluating what the student<br/>
knows or is learning at any given point in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know. I do think its significant that your daughter told you she<br/>
sees the words melting off the page or dripping down.<br/>
<br/>
Try reading Never Too Late. You could also read the part in George Dennison<br/>
s The Lives Of Children where he describes the physical contortions<br/>
(squirming, sighing, cringing, etc.) of the twelve-year-old student, Jose,<br/>
as he tries to read aloud. (John Holt wrote a review of this book that<br/>
emphasizes Joses evident agony  I think its in Sharing Treasures, the<br/>
collection of his book reviews.)<br/>
<br/>
(P.S.- The word you wanted is astigmatism, all one word. I think that<br/>
vision book has something to say about it, too.)<br/>

&gt; called Better Vision Without Glasses (or Better Eyesight  Im not sure<br/>
&gt; of the title).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The idea behind the book, as I remember it (I may have some of this mixed up<br/>
&gt; by now) is that myopia (nearsightedness) is not due to a permanent<br/>
&gt; congenital defect consisting of an abnormally elongated eyeball (which<br/>
&gt; causes the image to fall short of the retina), as optometrists would have<br/>
&gt; you believe, but to an incorrect use of the muscles that support the<br/>
&gt; eyeball, which can temporarily change its shape.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book explained that myopia is caused by staring  by not taking in the<br/>
&gt; whole scene through very rapid, fluid movements of the eyes in and out of<br/>
&gt; the distance while blinking frequently, but instead fixating on a single<br/>
&gt; point and straining to see it without much blinking at all. There were<br/>
&gt; exercises that supposedly could help you get rid of your glasses even after<br/>
&gt; years of using them. </span></blockquote></div>

Thanks for the correction &#39;astigmatism&#39;. I wasn&#39;t sure about that word.<br/>
I&#39;ve read Never Too Late but it&#39;s been a long time so I&#39;ll put it on the list to check out next library trip. The Lives of Children sounds good, too.  Have you read Smart Moves by Carla Hannaford? The subtitle is  Why Learning Is Not All In Your Head. From the back cover:<br/>
&quot;It is seldom that we find something so really original and groundbreaking written about education. Knowledge from the neurosciences, information about how bodily movement, emotional expression, nutrition, and the social and physical environment influence learning, are all brought together in a remarkable synthesis. I have never seen a better guide to creating more effective learning situations in home and school.&quot; --Dr. Willis Harman, President, Institute of Noetic Sciences<br/>

He had more to say in the revised edition addition about feeling that he had to &quot;pin the notes down&quot; or they&#39;d move and he wouldn&#39;t be able to find them again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In Never Too Late, John also talks about how, when stress hormones<br/>

Before I read this section of your post,  I was thinking about how both my mother and myself experience changes in our vision when under stress.  For me, it&#39;s as if I&#39;m wearing a hat too low over my eyes, or my forehead is interfering with my vision, but this has always been only observation based on my experience and I&#39;ve never heard or read anyone else talk about it before.<br/>

age?  Yes.  Most people I&#39;ve talked to say that starts in the 40&#39;s some <br/>
time, so it&#39;s had some practise here.  And then there&#39;s the fibro-fog that <br/>
goes with fibromyalgia......sigh.<br/>

28, but my body tends to argue with that.  In fact my body has been telling <br/>
