I don&#39;t envy you the rattlesnakes. (I was nearly bitten as a child)...we<br/>
don&#39;t have any here on the west side of the Cascades. But here in the city,<br/>
we still have quite the variety of wildlife. Possum, rabbits, foxes,<br/>
squirrels, bats, lots of birds.  Until just a few years ago, seeing a coyote<br/>
or deer or bear here in town wasn&#39;t that unheard of. (They would come down<br/>
from the mountains or across the bridge in the night.)  And cougars are<br/>
being seen much too often in the opinion of people building in the out lying<br/>
areas. Of course, the cougars were there first.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468091285">The kidlets like to catch the blue belly lizards and alligator lizards. <br/>
They had one of the alligator lizards that they kept for awhile and fed<br/>
those little tiny crickets.  It use to bite them and hang on but they are<br/>
so small you don&#39;t even feel the bite.  They sure look funny hanging there,<br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
We found a really different snake that no one knew what was not too long<br/>
ago.  It looked just like a rattlesnake color wise but wasn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>
any of the other snakes that we usually find around here either.  We can&#39;t<br/>
find it in any of the snake books.  Guess we&#39;ll have to send a picture down<br/>
to UC.<br/>
<br/>
There are parts of the county that we are NOT looking at to buy in because<br/>
they have the rattlers and scorpions have moved in too, something that is<br/>
not native but we seem to have acquired.  Those areas also have lots of<br/>
black widows and recluses.  I&#39;m not much on the nasty spider business as I<br/>
have severe allergies to all kinds of bites!<br/>

Not to worry. It&#39;s the east side of the Cascades that has the rattlesnakes,<br/>
not over on the Olympic Peninsula. The Peninsula is very lush and beautiful.<br/>
Lots of building going on there, which is both good and bad, of course. It&#39;s<br/>
also where those really nasty spiders live. There&#39;s a surplus of brown<br/>
recluses this year because the weather has been perfect for them. Olympia<br/>
itself (the city) was recently voted as &quot;coolest&quot; around.<br/>

It&#39;s great to hear that you don&#39;t rattlers (especially since we hope to join<br/>
you guys somewhere on Puget Sound in the near future).  And I agree---the<br/>
cougars had first dibs on the place!<br/>
<br/>
I have a health question for all of the Pacific Northwesterners on the list.<br/>
I have REALLY bad asthma.  The heat down here is really doing a number on<br/>
me.  All the people that I have spoken with in your area who have asthma say<br/>
that they are much better up there.  Any one have asthma?  If yes, could you<br/>
give me the benefit of your experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219715168">Cindy, if you get up in the moutains heading over towards Redding you start<br/>
getting into snake country and somehow or another they have acquired<br/>
scorpions.  That&#39;s about an hour plus from the coast.  Sooo, we are looking<br/>
about half an hour from the coast and although there may occasionally be a<br/>
snake, it isn&#39;t really rattlesnake country per se.  When we use to live in<br/>
Sonoma County there were tons of rattlers and you use to see them swimming<br/>
across the Russian River.  We had 50 acres out in the country and we<br/>
de-snaked our place and then put mess on the bottom couple of feet of our<br/>
fencing.  Worked great!<br/>
<br/>
We are looking from something that isn&#39;t too far from the ocean, close to<br/>
the rivers and has closer to seasons.<br/>
<br/>
We looked in Oregon and Washington but hubby said no on the coastal places<br/>
because of the amount of rain and fog and I don&#39;t like the heat and so<br/>
forth that so many of the areas in the eastern parts of the state get.  I<br/>
think Olympia was one of the rainer areas we looked in.<br/>
