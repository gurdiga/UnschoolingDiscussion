<div id="ygrps-yiv-217538877">I had a terrible day yesterday.  A friendship I had, or thought I had, <br/>
blew up in my face in a torrent of misunderstandings and angry words.  I <br/>
spent the remainder of the day depressed and withdrawn, and I went to bed <br/>
with a screaming headache.<br/>
<br/>
   I slept fitfully, with the words of the argument still echoing in my head. <br/>
 I just couldn&#39;t let it go.  Also restless last night was my three-year-old <br/>
daughter, Kayla, who was sleeping with us in our bed.  Kayla tossed and <br/>
turned, mumbled in her sleep, and kept kicking me in the back.  I finally <br/>
coaxed her into the crook of my arm, where she relaxed at last as we were <br/>
pressed heart to heart.  She reached up and patted my cheek, and whispered <br/>
&quot;Mama&quot; into the darkness.  She slept blissfully for the rest of the night.<br/>
<br/>
   How grateful I am for the shelter of my family, and for a lifestyle that <br/>
allows us both quality and quantity time.  Friendships may come and go, but <br/>
family is the rock upon which my heart clings.  Last night I lay holding <br/>
Kayla for a long time, blanketed in an overwhelming love.  And at last, I <br/>
slept.<br/>
<br/>
All is well,<br/>

<br/>
I  hope it wasn&#39;t about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are friends I have now with whom, in the past (mostly way past, when we <br/>
were younger and more volatile) we had huge disagreements.  My friend Frank <br/>
didn&#39;t communicate with me for eight years or more.  But he came back and <br/>
apologized.   My friend Jeff and I had such an argument once that his wife <br/>
called my husband to see if they could figure out a way to get us to make <br/>
peace.  I play music with him and some others every Monday night.  <br/>
<br/>
There are others with whom I had arguments and thought later &quot;Well!  I had no <br/>
idea such pigheadedness and dishonesty were living so close to my family.  <br/>
Good riddance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So that might not be at all comforting, but might be company to misery.<br/>
