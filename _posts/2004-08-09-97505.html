<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072566478">From what I understand, natural materials absorb the child worth and <br/>
reflect it back.  I haven&#39;t been following the discussion due to <br/>
computer problems but I almost sent my oldest in a Waldorf school in <br/>
Wilton NH where we were living at the time just 1/2 mile down the <br/>
road from a Wladorf community.  I used to do a Waldorf playgroup at <br/>
my house.<br/>
<br/>
I had learned about Waldorf while I was living in CT and liked what I <br/>
heard especially but once I saw it in action, I wasn&#39;t too <br/>
impressed.  It is very controlling from what the children can draw or <br/>
paint to the games they play, the toys you use, the stories they hear <br/>
and foods they eat.  Like all controlling environments, there seemed <br/>
to be a lot of unhappiness but it was subtle.  School is school.<br/>
<br/>
We had a woman do a workshop at HUG conference once on Waldorf <br/>
watercolor painting.  She was upset because we wouldn&#39;t limit the <br/>
ages and there was everyone in there from pre-schoolers to adults.  <br/>
It went smoothly and, truth be told, the adults had the most fun.  It <br/>
was a popular workshop but she wouldn&#39;t come back because we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
restrict the ages.<br/>
<br/>
I liked and still like some of the Waldorf ideas.  We have beeswax <br/>
and the girls still have their Waldorf dolls.  They played with <br/>
acorns and pinecones, we worked a lot with wool and I always try to <br/>
live near water. :-)  The Forest Children is our favorite picture <br/>
book and I like the sequential life it illustrates.<br/>
<br/>
The only way I could see it fit in with unschooling is to do what we <br/>
did and have the adult whose interested do the Waldorf thing and let <br/>
the kids join in activities if they want.  Unfortunatly, that is <br/>
against Waldorf philosophy and leads to Barbies and television.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, it&#39;s late.  I meant &quot;the child&#39;s warmth...&quot;  The reason this is <br/>
important is that it gives life to the doll.  I once heard a Waldorf <br/>
person say that a child needn&#39;t give up her plastic doll- the child&#39;s <br/>
love for the doll had redeemed it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798531186">&lt;&lt;To help students feel more at ease, a Waldorf school is &quot;all<br/>
natural&quot; --literally. Nothing in the classroom is made of plastic, because<br/>
it&#39;s not a natural substance. The children have wood stumps, they use<br/>
beeswax crayons instead of Crayola, and other natural materials such as silk<br/>
and wool. According to Johnson, the children&#39;s mental development benefits<br/>
from the feel, sight and smell of natural materials.&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I was thinking that after I posed my no plastic question. So...Could a person address those concerns by sticking to used toys? Then, you&#39;re not only not supporting the company that makes them but giving them a use after the original owner has grown tired of them. Not that they&#39;re a must buy but if a child wants one. <br/>
<br/>
  I think the original poster said her kids were happy with all her choices but I&#39;m suspicious of those claims in general. My mom could&#39;ve said I was happy too but she had a way of discussing things and presenting ideas that were leadeing..&#39;You don&#39;t want that plastic junk, do you?&quot;, and I&#39;d know what I was supposed to say. We did get plastic toys but I remember lusting over stuff my mom pooh-poohed. I wonder how many times we, as moms, kid ourselves that way? I know I have in the past. Much less since I came to unschooling however.<br/>

 <br/>
I attended a Waldorf form drawing seminar at the Rethinking Education  <br/>
conference.  I really really liked it.  I liked the way the  learning of it included <br/>
the entire body.  There is something soothing about  drawing the forms.<br/>
 <br/>
But still, I know Waldorf families (most of them in isolation from other  <br/>
Waldorf families) and where they bump up against unschoolers or other families,  <br/>
their kids are chomping at the bit to do the things the other kids do (play  <br/>
video games, watch a movie, mine the plastic weapon collection).  I like  <br/>
hanging out at their houses because there is always some level of &quot;natural&quot; that  I <br/>
can&#39;t recreate in my home.  But I tell ya, Will doesn&#39;t go over  there and <br/>
lament that the TV has a silk over it, or that there&#39;s no X-box.   He gets out <br/>
the wooden blocks and has a good time playing outside.  <br/>
 <br/>
II&#39;d have a hard time with any system that is difficult to pronounce,  <br/>
anyway.  ;)anthrosophomorphism?  anthroposophomorphradite?  I  can&#39;t even remember <br/>
what the syllables are any more.  lol.<br/>

<br/>
Forever&#39;s a long time.   There are plastic toys that don&#39;t survive being in <br/>
the yard in New Mexico, and once it dries out, it will break down into pieces <br/>
as tiny as sand.  Sand isn&#39;t biodegradable either, and the desert is full of <br/>
it.   Iron, in our yard.  The kids pick it up with magnets after it rains and <br/>
the water runs off.   That&#39;s not biodegradable.  Glass?  well... it turns back <br/>
to the sand it started off as.   Metal?  Rusts away eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Biodegradable&quot; is a buzzword with a lot of &quot;oooh!&quot; appeal, and I&#39;m sorry <br/>
styrofoam was ever invented, but not all plastic is evil.   Much of what we use <br/>
plastic for would have been glass or metal, and their creation, transportion <br/>
and disposal aren&#39;t all air and fairies.<br/>
<br/>
And for people to invent something 50 years ago and then declare that it will <br/>
sit in a landfill &quot;forever&quot; (the inventors probably aren&#39;t the same ones who <br/>
declared &quot;forever&quot;) is shortsighted and arrogant.     <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the early-plastic stuff they used to make brushes and mirror-frames <br/>
out of and knife handles and such?  Bakelite!   People HOPED that would last a <br/>
long time. It&#39;s falling apart.<br/>
<br/>
Foam, as used in some musical instrument cases, cut to the shape of each <br/>
piece.  Also used in auto padding, like inside ceiling liners.  Maybe not <br/>
everywhere, but in the desert that seems to last 20 some years and then turn to dust.  <br/>
 Rubber itself is tree stuff that turns back to dirt stuff.  I took a <br/>
doorbell apart yesterday, cleaned the parts.  It won&#39;t go back together.  The little <br/>
rubber holders for the chimes are too dried up and old.  Maybe the seals from <br/>
syringes would work.  Those aren&#39;t rubber anymore, I don&#39;t think, but some <br/>
kind of plastic.<br/>
<br/>
Archeologists will know more about what&#39;s biodegradable than modern <br/>
pop-ecologists will.  Museum curators will know more about what can be kept and what <br/>
can&#39;t.  The fingers are falling off my Tiny Tears doll.   She&#39;s not 50 years <br/>
old.  Rubber, though.<br/>
<br/>
Auto restoration people will know what lasts on a car.   Seats, of 1920&#39;s <br/>
cars? Horsehair and rotten upholstery have to be replaced.   Dashboards of 60&#39;s <br/>
cars?  Not in the desert.   <br/>
<br/>
If plastic lasted forever, houses could be made of it!  Bridges.<br/>

I think the Hearthsong catalog is really fun, and we have stuff from there.  <br/>
