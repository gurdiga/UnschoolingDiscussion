<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, it seems to have hit a nerve, and I&#39;ve got some totally<br/>
&gt; hilarious e-mails back -- my favorite was another student of Russian,<br/>
&gt; whose only remaining bit is knowing how to sing &quot;It&#39;s a Long Road to<br/>
&gt; Tipperary&quot; (in Russian.) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I thought a collection of these would make for a great future<br/>
&gt; article (and might be fun to share here as well, if you choose). (Now<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to offend anyone -- if language teaching somehow worked<br/>
&gt; for you, more power to it!) But I&#39;d love to get a little collection --<br/>
&gt; what linguistic flotsam-and-jetsam do you have hiding in your<br/>
&gt; synapses, and which flossing doesn&#39;t reach?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you post it here, I&#39;ll assume I can use it (without attribution of<br/>
&gt; course), unless you say otherwise?  (or you can send it to me privately.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been &quot;exposed&quot; to three---no, six, if you count Latin and  <br/>
Greek!---foreign languages. Six years of French (first through sixth grade), two years of <br/>
Spanish in high school, and three years of college German.<br/>
<br/>
I learned French the &quot;normal school way&quot;---drill, drill, and more drill. What <br/>
do I remember? cochon, mouton, vasche, cheval, chien, chat, tete, man (I&#39;m <br/>
probably misspelling several of those! &lt;G&gt;)---and I&#39;m VERY good with restaurant <br/>
French. But I&#39;m *just* as good with restaurant Italian---no lessons!!!<br/>
<br/>
I had two years of high school Spanish. The teacher entered the class and <br/>
said, &quot;My name is Miguel Hernandez. I am from Panama, and this is the last <br/>
English you will hear me speak in class.&quot;  Semi-immersion. I can still understand <br/>
s-l-o-w Spanish and read a good bit---haltingly.<br/>
<br/>
I had one pathetic year of college German and then spent my junior year in <br/>
Germany and Austria. Then I married into the Air Force and spent three more <br/>
years there. Total immersion. I am basically fluent (my writing leaves a bit to be <br/>
desired, but I can read well and carry on an extended conversation---I don&#39;t <br/>
just translate: I think in German.<br/>
<br/>
Five years of high school Latin and one college semester of Greek. I can <br/>
still translate Latin (and I remember most of the Lord&#39;s Prayer and Twinkle <br/>
Twinkle Little Star!), but all I remember in Greek is probably the letters! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having &quot;learned&quot; languages several different ways, I&#39;m positive the typical <br/>
school drill is useless. Total immersion---&quot;sink or swim&quot;---works because it <br/>
HAS to. <br/>
<br/>
People ask me all the time how to teach a child a foreign language. I tell <br/>
them to move to another country! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

nun and scared me to death but I loved the language and can still read it pretty <br/>
well. I wanted to take Italian next but that wasn&#39;t offered at our school so <br/>
I chose Spanish. I had 2 years of Spanish and all I remember about that classs <br/>
is that every Friday we sang La Bamba while shaking maracas. To this day, I <br/>
know little Spanish except how to count to 10 which I had learned at 3 from <br/>
watching Sesame Street and the words to La Bamba. (I&#39;m slowly learning a little <br/>
Spanish nowadays from my kids who love Dora the Explorer!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THis probably isn&#39;t what you&#39;re looking for, but it sure brought back <br/>
memories.<br/>
<br/>
I took German in Highschool, when most everyone else was taking Spanish and <br/>
French, probably because my paternal grandfather was born there.  We had one of <br/>
those teachers that was very tired by the time we made it to his 11th grade <br/>
classroom.  He was close to retirement age, and born in Germany.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
always &quot;get&quot; our American sense of humor.  His name was Mr. Schmidt.  <br/>
<br/>
Almost NONE of the language sunk in to ANY of us...probably 90 percent of us <br/>
squeeked by with a &quot;C&quot;.  One of the only things I remember was the <br/>
&quot;Schnitzelbaum&quot; (or was it Schnitzelbaun?) song.  We&#39;d pretend like we loved singing it <br/>
just to get ourselves out of more drills and quizzes..LOL!!  He had a <br/>
picture/chart thing in the front of the room and as we got to each part of the song, <br/>
he&#39;d point (with a long wooden pointer) at the picture we were supposed to be <br/>
singing about.  He would sing (something like) &quot;Ist das eine dickie Frau??&quot; and <br/>
we&#39;d sing back, &quot;Ya, das ist ein Dickie Frau&quot; (fat lady)...then we&#39;d go back <br/>
around the whole chart repeating each word and sing the chorus.  We&#39;d get <br/>
totally boisterous and overdo it...of course he thought we were having the time of <br/>
our lives!  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Only other thing I really remember is how he&#39;d go down each row, asking each <br/>
of us something in German, and we&#39;d have to answer back in German to him.  So <br/>
many of us were clueless!  We&#39;d get all dramatic, like we were on a game show <br/>
(someone in class would always make the &quot;clock ticking&quot; noise) then we&#39;d blurt <br/>
out anything we could think of, right or wrong.  The rest of the class would <br/>
clap and chime in &quot;Good answer!! Good answer&quot; family feud style.  He&#39;d look at <br/>
us exasperated, give the right answer, then call whoever as in the hotseat <br/>
&quot;Dummkopf!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few times if we were near &quot;Old World&quot; (a Germany style shopping center) <br/>
we&#39;d pick him up some struedel for him and his face would light up.  Never made a <br/>
difference in our grades though!!<br/>
<br/>
But we all loved him...his heart was in the right place.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236598340">My sister took Spanish so I learned to say, &quot;Esta Susanna is la cocina? <br/>
Si, Susanna esta in la cocina..&quot; I took a semester of Spanish for health <br/>

say, Yo hablo Espanol muy poquito,&quot; but it&#39;s not quite as true.<br/>

Oh, well, that and of course &quot;Ich bin ein Berleiner&quot;, which was made famous by JFK when he visited Berlin.

to say anything (except recite English poems or ANYTHING in Latin---THAT was <br/>
beautiful! I could listen to her recite ALL day!). But Robert and I (there <br/>
were only two of us in the class---who wants to take more than the manatory two <br/>
years of two or three years of one foreign language requirement? Just us! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
to avoid translating, would ask her a question about Roman customs or warfare <br/>
or religion or dress or architecture or.... It was a sure-fire way to kill <br/>
20-30 minutes! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Robert and I would plan class time around what lines of The Iliad we each had <br/>
translated the night before! And when and what we should ask about to get her <br/>
sidetracked on to some tangential discussion. But I treasure that time <br/>
now--both the recitation AND the history lessons. She&#39;s a brilliant, fascinating <br/>
woman with an incredible love and knowledge of the Classics! And *I* learned A <br/>
LOT!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240764866">**Several months ago, I had an article in Home Education Magazine called<br/>
&quot;Geese&quot; in which I detailed the efforts of my public school to teach<br/>
me Russian (I was a &quot;Sputnik&quot; baby).**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, David --<br/>
<br/>
I was born in 1959 and took a year and a half of Russian voluntarily<br/>
because I thought languages were cool.  However, all I can remember are<br/>
the words for potato, and pencil, and how to pronounce CCCP* with great<br/>
rolling flair.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t even call the country that any<br/>
more so it&#39;s an utterly useless utterance. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I took 4 years of French in high school, also voluntarily, and retained<br/>
a lot of that because I was semi-semi-fluent and could read Asterix<br/>
comics and favorite children&#39;s novels translated into French, and as an<br/>
adult I kept on reading French children&#39;s books every so often.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tempting to push my son towards learning French just because I have<br/>
a great stack of books to use, but I won&#39;t.<br/>
