<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263744320"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; For all the attachment <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  parenting, family bed, prolonged nursing, freedom from institutionalized <br/>
  education, I practiced, I didn&#39;t seem to be able to grasp that bigger <br/>
  picture. I still had hang-ups. I wanted to use punishment effectively, I <br/>
  wanted everyone to do their chores with smiles on their faces, I expected <br/>
  many things to be the way I wanted them to be.<br/>
    Oh, Nancy -- this is something I&#39;m really trying to grip myself!  Granted, we have only been unschooling for a very short while, but the more we do, the more dh relaxes, and the better things flow (I&#39;m the one whose dh really wanted a school-at-home atmosphere). But I&#39;m still running into all kinds of unexpected snags, even though I am a staunch supporter of all the things you&#39;ve mentioned above.  I am continually berating myself for not unschooling properly!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;Coming here has given me a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  peek at the bigger picture. You can&#39;t just unschool when it comes to <br/>
  *schoolish* things. You can&#39;t turn unschooling off at the end of the <br/>
  afternoon and expect things to be hunky-dory. You can&#39;t respect your <br/>
  children&#39;s choices in learning but not respect their choices in life. <br/>
          This is kind of the stage I&#39;m at.  I have a bizarre little story to insert here -- the other day, after church, my ds&#39;s Sunday School teacher stopped me to tell me he was concerned about my son.  Ds is nine, and in a class of all girls.  They tend to be very giggly and off-topic, and my son gets annoyed with them.  The teacher said, &quot;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong -- he is very polite and respectful and gets along well with adults, but he seems to think he is 16 or something, instead of 9.  He acts like he thinks the other kids are childish.  He is certainly a bright, sharp kid -- while I am struggling to explain to the others what an analogy is in the scriptures, he is able to not only understand, but apply and construe his own examples.  But he has no patience with them when they start getting off topic and fooling around.  He will actually get up and walk away if they won&#39;t settle down.  He doesn&#39;t know how to be a kid.  That&#39;s what I see the problem is with homeschooling.  Thoses kids don&#39;t know how to act around other kids.  You&#39;ve done fine with the academics, but he isn&#39;t very socialized.  In my professional opinion (he is a ninth grade teacher during the week), you need to get him involved with other kids a lot more, and you should think about putting him in school as soon as possible.  He needs to learn how to be part of a group; a team player.&quot;  I tried to explain that he is a Cub and a member of Junior Forest Wardens; that he went to swimming lessons and frequent field trips with a bunch of homeschool kids, and that we went and had a play day usually once a week at various friends houses, but he waved that aside.  I tried again.  &quot;He just doesn&#39;t like groups very much.  He is much happier one on one, and he also tends to be a leader.  As first born, he is used to being in charge a lot, and while I know he can get downright bossy, we have been trying to work on learning to compromise.  Maybe he is one of those kids who just prefers things to be the way he wants, and he&#39;d rather have a few close friends with similar goals and direction, than a throng of acquaintances. Kind of like Bill Gates, or something.&quot;  &quot;Or, like the Unabomber.  He has to learn to be part of a team -- just one of the players.  He needs to be put in positions where he HAS to do what the group wants, even if it is not what HE personally wants. He needs to learn to be one of the subordinates -- it is a situation he will be encountering all his life, and he needs to learn to deal with it now.&quot;  After a few more fruitless exchanges, I went away, totally dejected.  On the one hand, he was criticizing my son for knowing how to behave in church -- staying on topic, knowing his material, and wanting the others to be respectful to the teacher.  This is just how ds is -- he is a really focussed kid.  But I have certainly learned that *I* cannot choose that focus -- the minute I try to impose my goals on him, he shuts down.  SO he has obviously *chosen* to behave in what most people would consider an ideal manner in a public, teaching oriented forum.  (Notice I did not say &quot;learning&quot;?  *I* am learning!  :o)  )<br/>
  However, the teacher is then using that as proof that my son is doomed to a reclusive life, as he is not a group kind of kid.  So my question is this:  do I need to be concerned?  Was this just some big deal that I was totally oblivious to, or does he really need to get a handle on dealing with groups?  And how does this reconcile with unschooling?  Obviously I cannot *force* him to be part of a crowd, but is this something he really needs to be encouraged in?  He sometimes gets sad because he has so few friends, but most of the time he is too busy with his own projects and stuff that he doesn&#39;t really seem to care.  And he does tend to think that kids his age are immature, although he is very patient and kind with his younger sisters.  Of course, most older kids we&#39;ve come across don&#39;t look too favorably on a bossy younger boy trying to include himself in their doings, either. What is the balance here?!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want visions of unschoolers at conventions <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  with pamphlets and smiling faces saying &quot;can I take some time to show you how to unschool the right way?&quot; <br/>
          Why not?!  I&#39;d take one!  :o)  Debi<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566097748">**This is kind of the stage I&#39;m at.  I have a bizarre<br/>

<br/>
The teacher obviously has a strong pro-school bias that is going to<br/>
influence what he says.  Instead of trying to understand the situation<br/>
through his reporting it might be better to sit in on the Sunday school<br/>
class and watch how your son is behaving.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s perfectly fine for a child to be well behaved.  Also, I&#39;m<br/>
surprised that the teacher is surprised that your son is interested in<br/>
the lessons.  (Does the teacher actually think they are worthless and<br/>
unappealing?   That he has nothing of spiritual value to offer to<br/>
children -- how depressing!)  However, IF your son is going so far as to<br/>
chide the other children about their immature behavior, that sounds like<br/>
it could cause ongoing social interaction problems.  If I were the<br/>
parent, I think I would want to watch the class to see the specific<br/>
behaviors of the whole group of children.<br/>
<br/>
(I also think that it&#39;s possible that the situation would play out<br/>
differently if their was another boy in the class that your son could<br/>
relate to.)<br/>
<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t think that sending shy or independent children to<br/>
school improves them in any way.<br/>

I take it the Sunday school teacher is the one who said &quot;Or like the <br/>
unabomber..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would have said to him, Why does my child have to be put into situations <br/>
where he HAS to do what the group wants, even if it is not something he <br/>
wants? You praise my child for listening quietly, following directions, <br/>
knowing his lesson, yet when he doesn&#39;t act like the others in class, being <br/>
disruptive, talking out of turn, not paying attention and not knowing the <br/>
lesson, you say he needs to know how to do this so he will be socialized. <br/>
WHY??? <br/>
This man says your son isn&#39;t very socialized, yet I think your child <br/>
obviously is very socialized. He just may not be a social person. (nothing <br/>
wrong with that) There is a difference between knowing how to act socially, <br/>
and being a social person, too many people get the two confused. He knows how <br/>
to behave in situations like church, he knows how to behave in situations <br/>
like cub scouts. Why the push for the group mentality thing? It goes back to <br/>
that old adage, if everyone were jumping off the bridge would you do it too? <br/>
It seems he is saying *I want your kid to know the lesson, but I also want <br/>
your kid to run around and cause problems because the rest are doing it.* He <br/>
wants your child to know why jumping off the bridge is wrong, but he still <br/>
wants him to do it. @@ <br/>
I know he doesn&#39;t want his 9th grade classes to be disruptive. I am sure he <br/>
doesn&#39;t say to parents, *Jane is a great student, she behaves in class, does <br/>
her homework, passes her tests, and I think she is a terrific kid. The only <br/>
problem is Jane doesn&#39;t pass notes to her friends like all the others do. You <br/>
need to get Jane involved in the cheerleading squad, so she will act more <br/>
like all the other girls in her class.* <br/>

what the group wants even if it goes against his better judgment, only serves <br/>
to break a child down. It erodes their self confidence, it teaches them that <br/>
they are not important. <br/>
Darin says maybe the teacher is trying to make the point that kids have to <br/>
learn that sometimes the rights of an individual cannot supersede the rights <br/>
of the group. Ie the Unabomber may have the right to freedom of speech, but <br/>
not if it interferes with the rights of the rest of us. I say fine! But kids <br/>
can learn all about the rights of the individual vs the rights of the <br/>
majority by reading about cases like the unabomber, or numerous other court <br/>
cases and not be forced into a group situation where their self worth is torn <br/>
asunder! Thereby creating the child who will grow up and become exactly what <br/>
the so called lesson was supposed to teach/guard against. (a Unabomber, <br/>
Manson, Bundy or even the everyday average bank robber or drug dealer) Does <br/>
that make any sense or am I just rambling incoherently?<br/>

So I just discuss it with my kids.   I say &quot;that drama class(or karate, or <br/>
skating or hockey or whatever) is less structured and formal than their <br/>
school, so they&#39;re kind of taking a break!  And to you, it&#39;s the most <br/>
structured thing in your live AND you are there by choice.  It&#39;s just going <br/>
to be different for you.  If all the kids really wanted to be there, they&#39;d <br/>
all be more like you.  But cut them a break because they are tired of school, <br/>
and need to play.&quot;<br/>

I would write a letter and send it to the teacher IN WRITING and the <br/>

some of the writers here!<br/>
<br/>
IF Sunday School is to socialize, they should be socializing upward, not <br/>
downward to less maturity.   IF Sunday School is to consider the word of God, <br/>
or any moral or ethical issues, then a child who is interested in such should <br/>
be praised, not criticized.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067033562">I&#39;m not sure I introduced myself yet but I don&#39;t think putting him in school <br/>
is the solution.  The Sunday school teacher is a school teacher by <br/>
profession so if everyone home schooled he&#39;d be out of a job right?  It&#39;s <br/>
like asking an obstetrician if you should have a home birth.  If course he&#39;s <br/>
going to say &quot;NO!&quot;  Instead of complimenting your son on his good behavior <br/>
he is grasping at straws for reasons he thinks you should enroll him in <br/>
school.  In my opinion it&#39;s none of his business how you choose to educate <br/>
your child.  You&#39;re taking on a responsibility that alot of parents won&#39;t be <br/>
bothered with.  You should be encouraged and admired for it, not made to <br/>
defend your decision to him.<br/>
<br/>
Make him feel subordinate because he needs to get used to it??????  Give me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857064395">Perhaps you need to get another unschooled 9yo boy into the class so the two <br/>
of them can walk off together when the girls get antsy. I&#39;m sure the teacher <br/>
would see that as sign of positive socialization. <br/>
<br/>
Your son probably doesn&#39;t need to practice for a life filled with needing to <br/>
fit into a group of giggly 9yo girls. :) I wouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have run into this problem, especially in groups with schoolish <br/>
homeschoolers, or in groups with schooled kids meeting shortly after school. <br/>
My kids are there to get something more formally structured than the rest of <br/>
their day, while the rest of the kids are hoping to blow off steam. It can <br/>
make for tension. I ask my kids to try to be understanding, while still <br/>
trying to get their own expectations for the situation met.<br/>

Some people would prefer to send out flawless messages even at the age of <br/>

Temperament, personality and relationship between the writer and critic are <br/>
all bigger factors than anything objective we could say here.<br/>

When she wants help she asks.  <br/>
<br/>
I never correct Marty unless what he&#39;s written is ambiguous.  <br/>
<br/>
With Kirby, he hates making errors. So if the writing is going to be seen by <br/>
more than one person, I&#39;ll point out a thing or two, and ask if he wants me <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have an agreement.  I tell him what&#39;s misspelled, or spell for him, <br/>
only if he asks.<br/>
<br/>
When he was lots younger, I used to spell every word for him while he <br/>
wrote his stories, etc., because he couldn&#39;t read those words.  (He <br/>
became &quot;fluent&quot; at 7 &lt;g&gt;)  So, we had a precedent of me spelling words <br/>
all the time, and he was open to it.  As time went on (he&#39;s 8.5 now), he <br/>
wrote less, but since he could read, he didn&#39;t need my help so much.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t offer it.  <br/>
<br/>
It just came to a point where I realized that he might not be <br/>
comfortable for me to spell everything for him anymore, and so I simply <br/>
asked.  I said something like, &quot;I know you can read and everything now, <br/>
and I used to spell stuff for you.  I don&#39;t want to tell you how to do <br/>
something if you don&#39;t want me to, because it might mess with your <br/>
thoughts or something.  So, do you want me to tell you when you misspell <br/>
something?  Do you want me to tell you *before* if I happen to see you <br/>
about to do it, or *after* you&#39;ve finished what you&#39;re writing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He wants me to ask every time.  Sometimes he wants to get his writing <br/>
out right away, and doesn&#39;t want to be stopped.  Sometimes what he&#39;s <br/>
writing is to be seen by others and he wants to make sure they&#39;ll <br/>
understand it.  I don&#39;t hover over him when he&#39;s writing all the time, <br/>
so sometimes he just does it and doesn&#39;t care about the spelling and <br/>
doesn&#39;t ask me.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d much rather he learn that I respect his way of learning, than how to <br/>
spell everything perfectly.<br/>

didn&#39;t correct her that she&#39;d stop there and never move onto &quot;Mommy, could<br/>
you pick me up, please?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The standard spellings are all around us, just as full sentence speaking is.<br/>
And perhaps even more important are other kids trying to communicate using<br/>
creative spelling. Since no one uses the same creative spelling as anyone<br/>
else, kids realize trying to read nonstandard spelling is an effort and<br/>
sometimes the meaning isn&#39;t clear. There&#39;s a motive for standard spelling<br/>
when kdis feel a need to be clear.<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s &quot;vitally important&quot; to *her* to get the correct message across she<br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
As others suggested, asking if she wants help is good :-) My daughter and I<br/>
have talked a number of times about how English spelling isn&#39;t obvious --<br/>
someone came up with the idea of &quot;word jail&quot; to which any word that isn&#39;t<br/>
spelled how it sounds goes -- so she doesn&#39;t feel as though she&#39;s wrong if<br/>
she can&#39;t guess the standard spelling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742203353">I would correct based on context. That is, if the writing is for herself or others who share your learning philosophy, leave it be. But<br/>
if the email is to the non-supportive relatives whose corrections are likely to be far more tactless than yours, you might suggest<br/>
spellcheck or having someone read it over. It&#39;s her choice, though, whether to follow that suggestion.<br/>

she asks if some words she has already written are spelled correctly, then I <br/>
would tell her, or show her how to use the spell checker. Moly at 8.5 is very <br/>
funny about things like this. She wants me to help, but then doesn&#39;t. She <br/>
would come to me asking if I would read the emails she sends to her Grandma, <br/>
&quot;What words are wrong, Mom?&quot; So there I would sit, correcting her words and <br/>
she would just break out in tears. I learned that she didn&#39;t want me to <br/>
correct her words. She just wanted to know which ones were wrong. Why? Who <br/>
knows, 8.5 girls are funny. I showed her how to use the spell checker. She is <br/>
much happier with this arrangement. She can do it all by herself, and I think <br/>
that is what is important to her. <br/>

through his reporting it might be better to sit in on the Sunday school<br/>
class and watch how your son is behaving.<br/>
        I think this was a very valuable suggestion, and I took it this week.  The teacher had them outside on the grass, so I sat behind a tree where I couldn&#39;t be seen, and observed.  I saw that the girls were a tight little group who whispered and giggled and looked at my son, then whispered and giggled some more.  He sat with head bowed, trying to ignore them.  The teacher tried to get them discussing the Good Samaritan, and the girls answered some of the questions, but often strayed onto what movie they had seen the night before and who was going to be allowed at the sleepover.  Ds wandered to the edge of the creek, and picked up a stone (he has a rock collection at home he is constantly adding to).  The girls responded by giggling, and shrieking &quot;Don&#39;t throw that at us&quot;.  Instead, he threw them a dirty look.  Several times ds growled &quot;I wish you guys would be quiet&quot; without making eye contact with anyone.  I finally got up and went away.  Yes, it obvious ds needs to bone up his peer interaction skills in terms of lightening up a little and maybe making a wise crack instead of glaring.  He probably could use a reminder that he can&#39;t control their behavior, any more than I can control his.  But the Unabomber?  No, he just needs another guy to sit beside and draw off some of the fire.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; IF your son is going so far as to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>chide the other children about their immature behavior, that sounds like<br/>
it could cause ongoing social interaction problems.  <br/>
    This is, unfortunately, true.  Of course the other kids are not going to respond positively to being growled and glared at.  I can tell he is doing it out of frustration, though.  Anybody know a nice, pre-packaged curriculum that teaches how to interact with your peers?  (snicker)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I certainly don&#39;t think that sending shy or independent children to<br/>

The only problem is Jane doesn&#39;t pass notes to her friends like all the others do.

So why *should* his behavior in that situation be conventional? He isn&#39;t in<br/>

        Yes, now that some time has gone by, the words don&#39;t sting as much.  The truly sad thing is, in a few years the focus will have changed and his Sunday School teachers will be *encouraging* him to stand out from the crowd and be faithful to what he believes in.  Weird old world we live in.  Debi<br/>

          You know, Tia, I have been reading this tag line of yours for a while now, but it just struck me again how truly appropriate it is -- that and your other one, &quot;What you think of me is none of my business&quot;!   Debi<br/>

          This is true.  It&#39;s what we&#39;ve had to tell him about Cubs (&quot;Mom, how come the other kids are running in the halls instead of making their periscopes?  I really wanted to practice Morse code, and we couldn&#39;t, because they wouldn&#39;t sit down and listen&quot;).
