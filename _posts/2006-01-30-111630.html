<div id="ygrps-yiv-837058672">I wanted to share the dh is finally gone on his deployment.  He left <br/>
Friday.  Though it was very sad to see him go, I feel that the <br/>
anxiety of waiting for him to leave is over for all of our family.  <br/>
I think some of my son&#39;s behavior was exacerbated by the fact that <br/>
he was dealing with the emotions of my husband&#39;s leaving.  <br/>
<br/>
Since he has gone my son is being very loving to me, considerate, <br/>
and defensive over me.  For instance, he has initiated what seems <br/>
like a million hugs and kisses (which is not normally him).  He has <br/>
also been very protective of my feelings.  <br/>
<br/>
Like yesterday I went to the grocery store and before I went I asked <br/>
everyone if they wanted somethings special.  I usually do this and <br/>
it is almost always something different each time for each one.  <br/>
Well the youngest 5yog wasn&#39;t awake when I left so I didn&#39;t wake her <br/>
to ask and grabbed some starburst for her thinking she would love <br/>
them.  Well needless to say, she was very disappointed because it <br/>
was not what she would have asked for and boy did she ever let me <br/>
have it.  Well my son was very upset with her and told her he <br/>
thought that she was ungrateful and being a brat.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t upset about it, except I couldn&#39;t get her to stop crying.  <br/>
I offered to go back to the store, and she said no.  The other kids <br/>
offered to share their treats with her, and she said no.  She was <br/>
basically inconsolable for 30 mins. I went and laid down on the bed <br/>
with her and told her how sorry I was and that next time I would be <br/>
sure to find out what she would like before I went.  I also told her <br/>
that I thought what she was feeling was disappointment and that it <br/>
happens to everyone now and then.  She finally calmed down and all <br/>
was well in her world again.  She happily ate her starburst and even <br/>
shared them.<br/>
<br/>
I then explained to my son that it was my fault for not planning <br/>
better for her.  I also told him that he needed to remember that she <br/>
was 5 years old and didn&#39;t act that way because she was a spoiled <br/>
brat, but rather because she was VERY disappointed and that was they <br/>
only way she knew to express that emotion.  I am not sure if he <br/>
fully understood, but he no longer showed anger or frustration <br/>
toward her.  Which was really big for him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to share our progress in our house.  But now I <br/>
have a question.<br/>
<br/>
My son came to me yesterday morning and asked me to make a chore <br/>
list so that the kids would know what I needed help with around the <br/>
house.  I stood there quite shocked that he would think of helping <br/>
on his own like that.  So I have been pondering how to handle this.  <br/>
I really could use the help if the kids are willing, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want to be assigning chores that they feel they &quot;have&quot; to do.  What <br/>
I have come up with as of this morning is this...<br/>
<br/>
I think I could make a MOM&#39;S to do list and post it on the wall or <br/>
fridge or something.  Then explain to the kids that if there is <br/>
anything they think they might want to do to help out then I would <br/>
welcome the help.  I also would tell them that it is really okay if <br/>
they don&#39;t help, because the list is not to make them feel <br/>
obligated. The list is simply a reminder for me of what I would like <br/>
to accomplish at some point throughout the day.  What do ya&#39;ll <br/>
think?  Any other ideas of how I may go about this in a productive <br/>
and joyful way?<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say thanks again to all who initially replied a week <br/>
or so ago when I posted about my son.  I have applied some of the <br/>
wonderful advice and am at this point reaping the benefits of your <br/>
wisdom and gaining more of my own.<br/>

Please rethink the whole &quot;spoiled&quot; concept.  I used to have that  <br/>
thought and definition in my mind too, from growing up, and things  <br/>
that were said over the years, but I think it&#39;s wrong and cruel.   <br/>

You might want to share some of the ideas with your son if/after you  <br/>
read that, in way of soliciting his help.  If he feels like he&#39;s  <br/>
learning about parenting and child development (not by those words,  <br/>
but learning what will help him to be a good dad someday) he will  <br/>
feel more mature and useful now, maybe.<br/>

I think your solution&#39;s a good one!  Maybe have one column for all- <br/>
the-time chores, and another one for special, occasional or one-shot  <br/>
stuff, and invite them to add things to it.  It might be really fun  <br/>
to see what they add.<br/>
<br/>
I like calling it &quot;to do&quot; instead of &quot;chores&quot; too, because a &quot;chore&quot;  <br/>
is by definition drudgery and &quot;not fun.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We call it &#39;to do&#39; also - any time we have a bunch of stuff, I make <br/>
a to-do list and either write it on the chalkboard (we have a huge, <br/>
chalkboard painted chalkboard in the kitchen - 8&#39;x4&#39; section of <br/>
wall) or on paper and leave it and a pen/pencil next to it. In <br/>
amongst the &quot;clean crumbs from toaster&quot; and &quot;scrub the tub&quot; are <br/>
things like &quot;watch a movie&quot; and &quot;play Scrabble&quot; and such. Typically, <br/>
we do this over breakfast on the day we need it and all 3 of us toss <br/>
in ideas. Then I re-write and group things so that all &#39;going out of <br/>
the house&#39; things are together, or all &#39;upstairs&#39; things are <br/>
together and so on. Saves steps later on. And, often, we&#39;ll lump all <br/>
the going out activities together and combine them, if possible, <br/>
with a stop at a favorite restaurant for lunch or dinner.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a standing list, DH has stuff he does each day (today, <br/>
Monday, for instance, is laundry day-since it&#39;s just the three of <br/>
us, one concerted effort gets everything washed and dried by <br/>
dinnertime and we put in a movie after dinner and fold and put away <br/>
whatever hasn&#39;t been folded and put away by then). If DS asks to do <br/>
something, there&#39;s always some part of what&#39;s going on he can do - <br/>
sweeping the kitchen (he loves the Swiffer wetjet), rinsing or <br/>
drying dishes, dusting, etc.<br/>

I say this as gently as I can, not knowing you or your family at all,<br/>
but it sounds like your sweet boy is trying to fill his daddy&#39;s shoes.<br/>
 Which can be a good thing, but can also be a very stressful and<br/>
burdensome thing for a young boy to try to do.<br/>
<br/>
Did your Dh, before leaving, perhaps have a father-son chat about<br/>
responsibility and taking care of Mom and the younger siblings?  A<br/>
sensitive child could even have just picked up on what they think they<br/>
are &quot;supposed to do&quot; during such a period of time in a family.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to gently talk to him about what he is thinking about<br/>
Dad being gone and let him know that it is okay to just be 11 years<br/>
old, that you and DH have taken care of the adult stuff and even<br/>
though Daddy is gone, you have things under control just fine.<br/>
<br/>
My own DH talks sometimes about how his older brother tried to fill in<br/>
his daddy&#39;s place whenever he would be deployed, and how he hated it<br/>
when the big bro would take on that authoritarian voice and try to<br/>
boss him around and make him do chores and such.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just something to think about.<br/>

process her sense of loss about her father going, and that this small upset<br/>
was just the trigger that enabled her to get started on the good cry that<br/>
she needed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***Well, I hadn&#39;t really thought about that, but I guess anything is <br/>
possible.  He doesn&#39;t seem stressed to me, he actually seems to be <br/>
relieved, but I could be misreading him too.  Anxiety usually runs <br/>
pretty high around here the week or so before dh leaves, and it is <br/>
like we all exhale and decompress after he is gone.  It sounds <br/>
pretty crappy, and we are all very sad to see him go, but the <br/>
waiting for him to leave and counting down the days is really hard <br/>
on everyone including dh.<br/>
<br/>
My son still does all the regular things that he does all the time. <br/>
None of that has changed.  He still reads half the day, watches <br/>
movies 1/4 of the day, and goes to his friends for a couple of <br/>
hours.  So the external normalcies are all firmly the same (except <br/>
for dad being here).  <br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t have any talks about responsibility and &quot;stepping up&quot; <br/>
and such, not that I know of at least, but they have had them in the <br/>
past. Now that my son is older he maybe feeling the need (or the <br/>
pressure)to step up from his age or from previous expectations.  <br/>
Either way I have pretty much decided not &quot;ask&quot; much of anything <br/>
from him or my girls.  I am going to post the To Do list and then <br/>
see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been very helpful already with out the list and with <br/>
out me having to ask in many cases.  They haven&#39;t initiated much, <br/>
but when they see me folding laundry or carrying it they will <br/>
say &quot;let me help you with that&quot;, or just start folding with me while <br/>
they tell me about something that is on their mind.  The list will <br/>
be in place so that if they want to be helpful then they will have <br/>
something to go with that they know really does need to be done at <br/>
some point.  Like a reference point if they want one.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t feel like I need to make him feel like the &quot;man&quot;.  <br/>
Although, now that I am thinking about it, there are times when he <br/>
sees me doing something that he feels is too much for me, and he <br/>
basically takes over.  In those instances what I see in him is that <br/>
he is proud, because he is stronger than me.  And all those times <br/>
are self-initiated.  I am always grateful because he is stronger <br/>
than me and he always picks the perfect time to catch me and help.  <br/>
He really is an awesome kid.<br/>
<br/>
Well these were interesting points that you made and I think I <br/>
should keep a watchful eye on the situation to be sure that he (or <br/>
the girls) don&#39;t feel like they have to be the adult because there <br/>
is only one for awhile.  It also helps to have thier friends around <br/>
here because they focus more on play or helping their school friends <br/>
with their homework ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I get a kick out of that one, that my 10 yod spent half the night <br/>
last night helping her girlfriend a 7th grader with her homework and <br/>
did a great job!  The did a project and it was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am going to encourage play and fun, by not encouraging <br/>
them to fill their daddy&#39;s shoes, just in case.  I want them to be <br/>
kids, not little adults.  They&#39;ll have plenty of time for adult <br/>
stress and responsibility when they are adults.  They don&#39;t need it <br/>
now.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.<br/>

her or what the other kids offered.  Since then I have made Daddy <br/>
and Me movies for each of the kids with my digital camera and the <br/>
computer so that each child has a movie with them and daddy that is <br/>
just theirs and they can watch it anytime right on the tv.  They <br/>
have enjoyed this as well as cried a few tears.  <br/>
<br/>
The little ones have a harder time understanding the situation.  I <br/>
have a hard time with it in my heart, so why would my 5 year old be <br/>
able to handle it perfectly.  <br/>
<br/>
You would think living this life for the last 13 years would give me <br/>
tons of insight and that I would have this all under control and see <br/>
it coming.  Now I just want to sit here and cry, because you all see <br/>
it so much clearer than I do and right about now I feel like I am <br/>
leaning on all of you to guide me through parenting my children. I <br/>
am mentally exhausted I guess and I just am not picking up on the <br/>
things I should.  I am trying.<br/>
<br/>
I must look pretty stupid with my post and the fact that I am <br/>
missing what is right before my face.  Maybe I needed a good cry <br/>
too! Well this is probably the most eradic post I have ever sent and <br/>
don&#39;t even know if any of it just made sense.  There sure are a lot <br/>
of I, I , I&#39;s in this. <br/>

<br/>
We went through something similar on a much smaller scale when my DH<br/>
was going away for a two-week business trip, and I noticed my 14yo was<br/>
acting very sweet and protective and responsible.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily a bad thing at all, just a fresh awareness of others&#39;<br/>
needs.  I just know how *my* boy can really put a lot of pressure on<br/>
himself that way.<br/>

<br/>
Making distinctions between being kids and &quot;little adults&quot; can be  <br/>
problematical.  If each is just seen as the whole person he or she  <br/>
is, and if childishness isn&#39;t extinguished, then the maturity will  <br/>
develop gradually without needing to crowd out the playfulness.  If  <br/>
one of my children is about to do something very mature, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be great for me to say &quot;No, just play and be a kid.&quot;   But if Kirby  <br/>

real parents are, I would ask him not to do that.  That&#39;s not a  <br/>
maturity or responsibility issue, that&#39;s a control issue, and  <br/>
boundaries issue.<br/>

I read it as you explained it.  I just thought it seemed you were  <br/>
giving away too much credit for understanding.  If we reflect back to  <br/>
you, and you accept it, we were not much more than just a mirror you  <br/>
looked into.  On can look into a mirror and say &quot;That&#39;s not what I  <br/>
look like&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s not happening,&quot; or one can look carefully and  <br/>
thoughtfully, which you seem to be doing.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ya know when I read this I went back and read my post and I can see <br/>
why you might assume my children were unattended.  However, if you <br/>
had some concern about that you could have addressed by asking the <br/>
above question about supervision without, what I percieved to be, <br/>
the accusation that follows.  I felt that you immediately accused <br/>
that I was neglectful in not so many words.  If you don&#39;t know the <br/>
circumstances surrounding an event you can ask, get your answer, and <br/>
then decide whether or not you need to address the situation with <br/>
your opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in MY opinion it is an individual decision that families need <br/>
to make based on the maturity level of each child involved.  There <br/>
are 16 year olds that can&#39;t be left alone even to take care of <br/>
themselves because they are simply not responsible enough yet to <br/>
make good and safe choices.  There are also 11 year old children and <br/>
some even younger in our state that are latch key kids and are very <br/>
responsible for their age.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving children at home alone for any period of time has certain <br/>
risks associated with it but so does letting them do just about any <br/>
other activity out there.  My 11 yo son, for instance, plays one <br/>
street over with out me there with him for 1.5 - 2 hours at a time.  <br/>
I have helped him all that I feel I can about making safe decisions <br/>
without me there to hold his hand.  He checks in with me and goes <br/>
back to play if he chooses.  This didn&#39;t happen over night, but in <br/>
time he learned what he needed to in order to be able to go.  He <br/>
goes there to play because the *14 yo* boy that lives there is not <br/>
allowed to leave his cul-de-sac, because his parents feel he not <br/>
responsible enough.  That is their choice based on how they see <br/>
their son.<br/>
<br/>
Can I be sure that he will not get hurt, be abducted or some have <br/>
some other horrific tragedy befall him?  Of course not, there are <br/>
never any guarantees, but we do the very best that we can to help <br/>
prevent bad things from happening to our children, but when you have <br/>
done all that you know how to do to ensure their safety and well <br/>
being then that is, once again in my opinion, the best that we can <br/>
do. I am not going to make him stay home and have no freedom until <br/>
he hits some magical age made up by somebody else, fit to some other <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
You may be very uncomfortable with ever leaving your children home <br/>
alone or letting them out of your site for that matter and that is <br/>
fine.  I won&#39;t judge you.  If it doesn&#39;t feel right to you then you <br/>
should probably go with your gut instinct.  I think it was and is <br/>
wrong to judge someone without all the facts.  Family dynamics <br/>
differ greatly and each child has to be viewed as an individual.  <br/>
<br/>
There are many other things to address as well, like do they have an <br/>
adult they can access immediately (next door neighbor), do they <br/>
understand how to use 911 and know other emergency contacts, how <br/>
long is the adult going to be away and how far are they going and <br/>
many more things to consider.  <br/>
<br/>
Regardless, you may disagree with me, but you posted your opinion of <br/>
my choices without any information to back up your concerns.  You <br/>
stated how worried you were that my children were alone.  Maybe next <br/>
time you should ask before jumping to conclusions and assumptions <br/>
when you simply don&#39;t have the facts.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my children were not unattended, my neigbor was here!<br/>

the dog, knew which neighbors were home... it was never without  <br/>

happily and easily.  I&#39;d go down to the store - a few blocks away,  <br/>
very often. She was very responsible - had even taken a Red Cross  <br/>
babysitting course. I wouldn&#39;t leave her with both younger sisters  <br/>
because when she was &quot;babysitting,&quot; she concentrated on playing with  <br/>
the one she was with. I didn&#39;t want her to be trying to handle two  <br/>
younger kids. But one? Easy.<br/>

There is no magic age - but there are plenty of 11 year olds who  <br/>
babysit.<br/>
