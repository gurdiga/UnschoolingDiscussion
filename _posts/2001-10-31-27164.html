&quot;School&#39;s Out&quot; by Dan Pink in Reason Magazine.  A neat article on <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>

Excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
For much of the 20th century, the U.S. depended on what I call the <br/>
Thanksgiving turkey model of education. We placed kids in the oven of <br/>
formal education for 12 years, and then served them up to employers. <br/>
(A select minority got a final, four-year basting at a place called <br/>
college.) But this model doesn&#39;t work in a world of accelerated cycle <br/>
times, shrinking company half-lives, and the rapid obsolescence of <br/>
knowledge and skills. In a free agent economy, our education system <br/>
must allow people to learn throughout their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Home schooling and alternatives to high school will create a nation <br/>
of self-educators, free agent learners, if you will. Adults who were <br/>
home-schooled youths will know how to learn and expect to continue <br/>
the habit throughout their lives.<br/>
