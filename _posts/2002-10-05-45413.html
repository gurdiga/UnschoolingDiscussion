Why not? I still need my Mom and I no longer have the option of getting time <br/>
with her...ever again.<br/>
I understand that you wouldn&#39;t want a 20 y.o. that had to have you there in <br/>
order to fall asleep, but there is a world of developmental difference <br/>
between a 9 y.o. and a 20 y.o.<br/>
Don&#39;t worry. Needing Mom at 9 is perfectly normal.<br/>
Pushing her to not have this at night will only make her more needy AND cause <br/>
physchological damage.<br/>
I think you are a wonderful Mom for continuing to meet her very real need.<br/>
She will become independant, she won&#39;t need you to sing her to sleep when <br/>
she&#39;s 20...I&#39;d bet money on it. But she will still need you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  It&#39;s nice to be able to come here for that encouragement <br/>
when I have those panic moments. :)  Of course I want her to still <br/>
need me when she&#39;s 20!  I just don&#39;t want her to need me to get to <br/>
sleep and not be able to leave me ever.  I just have these visions of <br/>
her turning down marriage proposals because it would mean she&#39;d have <br/>
to leave me, or making me go to work with her because she can&#39;t <br/>
handle being away from me all day.  To those of you who have older <br/>
children, that probably sounds as silly as hearing someone with a 2 <br/>
year old worrying that he&#39;ll still be in diapers when he&#39;s 20, <br/>
but...well, what can I say, it was a panic attack!  <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else we as moms can do to help our kids develop <br/>
more confidence in being away from us, and to make them feel safe <br/>
when they&#39;re apart from us?  Or do we just sit back and wait? <br/>

they want it.  And we wait.  And then when they push us away, we miss those<br/>
times.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yes. Fill them up with love, nurture and the meeting of needs. Their <br/>
confidence is stronger and they can do these things in their own time.<br/>
Don&#39;t push them to be away from you, don&#39;t shame or guilt if they fall apart <br/>
when away.<br/>
That will bring about happier, better results I believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771327559">*IF* she is wanting to do sleepovers, etc......<br/>
<br/>
-use a timer- 1/2 hour lay with Mom this week, 20 minutes, next week, etc.<br/>
-books, music on tape /CD to fall asleep to.<br/>
-Sleepy Time tea or something with chamomile ( I can not even think of <br/>
drinking a cup in the daytime- it really relaxes you!)<br/>
-she is old enough to understand &#39;stress management&#39; techniques- deep <br/>
breathing, muscle relaxation...<br/>
<br/>
if she is not upset about sleep overs, etc. and you are the one having <br/>
one of our common &#39;oh no she will never be able to do this&#39; sort of <br/>
parent angst moments ;-)<br/>
well, then, you do the deep breathing and relax! There have been some of <br/>
the most beautiful sentiments expressed here on the subject- enjoy them.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Jude<br/>

<br/>
I believe from La Leche League, The Continuum Concept, and personal <br/>
experience and observation that the more &quot;us&quot; we give them when they ARE with <br/>
us, the sooner they venture out on their own.  It&#39;s not sitting back and <br/>
waiting, it&#39;s BEING as beingful as we can be, as much as they want.  Being <br/>
there physically, emotionally, mentally, humorously, lovingly and constantly. <br/>
  And then when they leave it&#39;s because they want to go more than they want <br/>
to stay.  And THAT is safety and confidence.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What my parents did that helped us with sleepovers was they often slept over<br/>
too.  My parents would visit their friends and vice versa and visits often<br/>
were sleep overs.  So one day instead of them being there also we were by<br/>
ourselves.  Nobody even noticed when this happened.  I do remember being<br/>
driven home once in the middle of the night, so as Ren says above, falling<br/>
apart isn&#39;t the end sleeping over.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have always been surrounded by adults who have been a part of their<br/>
lives so they are used to the idea that other grown ups can take care of<br/>
their needs.  So this has helped with their sleep overs.<br/>
<br/>
Going camping with a group is another way to do a semi-sleep over.  Kids<br/>
often wind up sharing tents.<br/>
