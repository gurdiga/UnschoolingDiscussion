 I joined this list to learn something about unschooling, a concept that is<br/>
 fairly new to me.  I do not feel I can direct the conversation that way (as<br/>
 someone suggested), because I don&#39;t even know enough to know what to ask.<br/>

We are happily unschooling (more or less, some days more, some days less) our <br/>
two kids (5 1/2 yo girl, 7 yo boy) in Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you?<br/>
<br/>
We are more structured in math, less in reading, back and forth as needed.<br/>
<br/>
We change things as we come across new activities.  Or if something doesn&#39;t <br/>
click, we scrap it.<br/>

My kids take outside lessons for dance, piano and Tae Kwon Do -- and an <br/>
online course for math for son.<br/>

We have found that school didn&#39;t really end this summer -- we slowed down, <br/>
other neighbor kids were around more, some outside lessons took a break, but <br/>
we still went to the library (we&#39;ve GOT to get there today -- have some <br/>
REALLY overdue ones now), still read a lot, still discovered things in the <br/>
back yard and now are in the midst of painting the kids&#39; bedrooms (ugh!).<br/>

I am in Talladega, Alabama.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 14 yo daughter.  She was diagnosed ADHD in the first grade and I<br/>
spent almost as much time at school as she did.  About 2-1/2 years ago I<br/>
started homeschooling.  We followed a strict curriculum and both of us were<br/>
going insane.  I believe I was thinking more about what other people would<br/>
think than about her needs.  Or I was just afraid to trust my instincts.  At<br/>
the end of the last year I started taking a really good look at what she was<br/>
being tested on and ... grew up or something, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I went to a seminar that included some unschooling information and have been<br/>
trying to learn all I can since then.  I still have some fear that we won&#39;t<br/>
&quot;do&quot; this right -- but I think she is so stressed that I don&#39;t care.  It<br/>
can&#39;t be any less effective than what we&#39;ve had.<br/>
<br/>
The one bright spot in her last year was the Saxon math program.  It was<br/>
such a success for her (especially compared to past math experiences) that<br/>
we will continue it this year ... though I have a few changes in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I am not really sure what we will do.  She desperately<br/>
needs to de-school, but she is so used to failure that if I don&#39;t give her<br/>
some type of academics that make her feel successful, it will just increase<br/>
her sense of failure.  She will think she is not &quot;schooling&quot; because I&#39;ve<br/>
given up on her or something.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any experience unschooling after alot of damage has already<br/>
been done, I&#39;d sure like any advice or thoughts you might have.<br/>

me, imo, ymmv, etc.  . . .<br/>
<br/>
that 14 years old is old enough to participate in the process.  You are <br/>
trying to make all these decisions and your daughter may (or not) have some <br/>
ideas about what to do.  And you don&#39;t have to do it all at once.  Maybe the <br/>
two of you could pick a subject and read about it or go to the museum or <br/>
library or university or planetarium or zoo and do follow-up &quot;grownup&quot; <br/>
research and go more in depth.  <br/>
<br/>
Then,  when she has had a wonderful time learning about stars, for example <br/>
(and NASA has some great free stuff on their sites, fwiw) you could move on <br/>
to sewing a dress (do girls still do that?) or studying Spanish or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Then you could sit down, after giving yourselves a fair chance (6 months, a <br/>
year, longer?) and figure out how many topics you &quot;really&quot; covered.  Stars -- <br/>
science, reading, math, etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think deschooling means you have to veg out in front of the TV (altho <br/>
that can be therapeutic too!) just a change from the school routine and <br/>
learning how you and she need to approach things in order to learn.<br/>

Just some thoughts.<br/>

Good luck.<br/>

go out and have fun with her. Plan things together<br/>

<h4>Cathie _</h4>
<p><small><time>18 Jul 2000, at  2:50am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081708613">Hi Cathy. I took my dd out of school after the 7th grade. My girl, Megan was <br/>
doubtful about it too, especially unschooling. She really thought that <br/>
without assignments and tests and grades, she was not learning. The big <br/>
breakthrough for her was old movies.<br/>
<br/>
She had gotten into old movie musicals from the library and was watching <br/>
them all the time. One day I said, &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you turn these movies <br/>
into school, and really learn something about them?&quot; The next time we went <br/>
to the library she came out with a big stack of books on that era of movie <br/>
making. I love these movies, too, so it was interesting for me to hear all <br/>
that she was learning. She really got into it-stuff about Judy Garland and <br/>
how she was mistreated as a child, the things that MGM did to the female <br/>
stars was totally appalling. She learned alot about choreographers and <br/>
music, followed up on the careers of some of the stars, found pictures and <br/>
songs on the net, oh, all kinds of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This finally convinced her of the value of following her own interests. She <br/>
did more work on this project than she had ever done in school, and it was <br/>
about a topic she chose, not one that someone else said she needed to learn.<br/>
<br/>
She also spent tons of time on the internet. She has made some really good <br/>
friends that way-in fact, she is now in Wisconsin on a campout with a bunch <br/>
of these kids. She also learned more social studies than she ever did in <br/>
school just by talking to kids from other countries. She did alot with kids <br/>
from Holland. She could tell me all about the country, not just dry <br/>
statistics, but what they learned in school, how much internet service and <br/>
houses and stuff cost, what the weather is like, things people do there, <br/>
crime and local news.  She knew time zones around the world-she could tell <br/>
where someone was by the time on their icq message. It took me pointing out <br/>
to her that this was educational-turning it into educational lingo-to show <br/>
her that when she was having fun she was doing school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539303322">Cathy, as someone who has no experience of what you&#39;re going <br/>
through, all I can say is that it&#39;s never too late, though sooner is, <br/>
IMO better &lt;g&gt;  You both have a lot of pain to heal, and a lot of <br/>
de-schooling (I am still de-schooling myself, and I&#39;m 26!) and it <br/>
will take time.  I wish you the best and hope you find the support <br/>
and encouragement you need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-403196683">Corallyn -- I was a &quot;successful&quot; ps student -- well at least academically.<br/>
Good grades, for the most part good relationships with teachers.  But<br/>
working with Katrina, I realized just how little of it I retained.<br/>
Diagramming sentences, which was not a problem for me, but was disaster for<br/>
Katrina, almost collapsed us last year, and when I tried to justify all the<br/>
time in my mind, I realized just how ridiculous it all was.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right.  My mother died two years ago.  We were good friends<br/>
later on, but we went through a long period when we were not.  Alot of that<br/>
came from just not knowing her, from the inside out, if you know what I<br/>
mean.  And that happens because there is just NO TIME for families when<br/>
school becomes the focal point of everything.<br/>

<br/>

&gt; the things that we both enjoyed. I also think this<br/>
&gt; would have cut down on the years many people, me<br/>

&gt; their mothers. You know what I mean? Mom has said to<br/>
&gt; me since that she regrets not knowing about<br/>
&gt; homeschooling or she would have done it. Anyway, just<br/>
&gt; go out and have fun with her. Plan things together<br/>
&gt; that you both have wanted to do but didn&#39;t have time<br/>
&gt; because she was in school all day. I guess what I am<br/>
&gt; trying to say is that through the homeschooling<br/>

&gt; &gt; interests her, she will eventually return to<br/>
&gt; &gt; educational or learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; pursuits.  I had a hard time believing it at first,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but too many people have<br/>
&gt; &gt; said it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;The one bright spot in her last year was the Saxon math program.  It was<br/>
&gt;such a success for her (especially compared to past math experiences) that<br/>
&gt;we will continue it this year ... though I have a few changes in mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is great.  Saxon hasn&#39;t worked well for us.. at least not yet, but you<br/>
never know.<br/>

have a child who was molested at 4. At 12 realization of what was done to<br/>
her began to dawn and we spent a great deal of time healing.  We did not do<br/>
anything even remotely connected to learning.. we just lived --survived<br/>
together.  We cried alot. She spent a huge amount of time alone in her room.<br/>
As she began to heal she started asking for *more*.....more to read, more to<br/>
do.   Success and feeling confident does not have to come from academics,<br/>
especially if it&#39;s been a source of contention for a long while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283650777">Cindy, thanks for the book suggestion.  I do want Katrina to participate<br/>
more.  I think the biggest obstacle there may simply be that she does know<br/>
anything BUT textbooks, tests and grades.<br/>
<br/>
She has definitely been under alot of control.  Just being &quot;watched&quot; all the<br/>
time after the label is control.  And that includes my own &quot;watchful&quot; eye.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t know what to do with freedom -- but I&#39;m betting on her.  She&#39;ll<br/>
get there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; never know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am actually not sure whether Saxon is that great for her, or just great in<br/>
comparison.  In contast to her other academics, the repetition gave her some<br/>
success every day.  I know I did see alot of improvement in her math skills,<br/>
but I attribute some of that to the &quot;success&quot; issue.  Having the structured<br/>
math also offers some comfort to my husband, who is still a little leery of<br/>
unschooling (which is better than when he thought I&#39;d lost my mind).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(Did you hear my gasp?)<br/>
No I am not sure of those thoughts.  And I have not addressed that with her<br/>
specifically.  I know she feels like a failure but it is in all areas, or at<br/>
least it carries over to all areas.  She was labeled severely ADHD in the<br/>
first grade and it has been a long road, with some of the most ridiculous<br/>
nightmares that were entirely unnecessary.  I withdrew her from public<br/>
school in April of her 5th grade year and then recreated the school at home<br/>
for 2-1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
But the reason for the gasp -- Katrina was molested before she was six.<br/>
After years of not remembering, she inadvertently learned of this a few<br/>
months ago.  Her anger was frightening to behold.  She is more accepting now<br/>
but is also starting to have some memories.  I became so aware of the stress<br/>
that she was under that I began to really question and look at all the areas<br/>
of her life, especially the academics.  At that time, they were taking so<br/>
much time that they WERE her life.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how much pain she was in, I tried to stop &quot;school&quot; at that point.<br/>
She absolutely insisted that we finish each and every textbook.  Well, we<br/>
did, but I stayed up nights to find shortcuts.  That&#39;s when I realized how<br/>
ridiculous the questions were on her tests.  Sheesh.  But I had to be really<br/>
inventive to skip anything.  She would almost cry if she thought I was<br/>
purposely trying to make something easier for her.    Maybe this was just<br/>
temporary, maybe she was just afraid to have anything else unfamiliar to<br/>
deal with.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize that this is so long.  This may not be appropriate for a list,<br/>
and if so I am sorry.  I know that I have to follow my heart with Katrina,<br/>
but sometimes my heart feels very confused.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; karate or gymnastics or some other sport/activity?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is very good at basketball, but only if she plays alone.  Katrina&#39;s<br/>
&quot;social failures&quot; make her so anxious around others that team efforts don&#39;t<br/>
work well right now.  It is just so HOT right now, but I do want to give her<br/>
more opportunities in that area.<br/>
