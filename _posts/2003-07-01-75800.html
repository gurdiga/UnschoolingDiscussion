Regarding slavery in America: this happens mostly with trafficking in people, <br/>
mostly for domestic work, sex, and sometimes for sweatshop or agricultural <br/>
work. Most often it&#39;s the first two. I&#39;ll try to find more info on the issue in <br/>
America.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Kathryn.  I did do some of my own research and found exactly the kinds <br/>
of things you mention.   I  haven&#39;t checked the link you provided yet, I will <br/>
as soon as I have time.  So far, I haven&#39;t found anything about buying and <br/>
selling people as slaves, like property.  I read a lot about the indebtedness <br/>
stuff, and deceit and entrapment and all of that.. but nothing about money <br/>
changing hands.  I am going to keep researching though.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jailed mother.  Do you have capital punishment in your state?  Then it would<br/>
be dead mother.  I&#39;m sure this mother had the same reaction at first, but<br/>
decided she wanted to still be available to her daughter rather than in<br/>
jail.  The police couldn&#39;t do anything as long as the girl *appeared* to<br/>
want to be where she was.  I haven&#39;t heard about her for a long time, but<br/>
last I heard she was doing fine.<br/>
