<div id="ygrps-yiv-352773559">Hello everyone,<br/>
My name is Nina. I am a writer and homeschooling mom to 3 kids, ages <br/>
15, almost 12 and almost 4. We have been homeschooling for 9 years. I <br/>
am the editor and publisher of The Edgy-catin&#39; Mama, a zine that <br/>
explores the side of homeschooling you seldom hear about in the more <br/>
mainstream publications...first issue is free if anyone is interested <br/>
and I am always looking for submissions.<br/>
<br/>
We began homeschooling when my son was in first grade after he was <br/>
diagnosed with rather severe dyslexia. We have continued for a <br/>
variety of reasons, too numerous to mention.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is something that we kind of fell into. It seems to fit <br/>
our family quite well, although I will admit we do panic every now <br/>
and then and do the math worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the country with 3 dogs, 6 cats, 10 rescued parrots, 3 <br/>
guinea pigs, 8 rabbits and 2 hermit crabs...can you guess what our <br/>
homeschooling revolves around? <br/>
I am looking forward to meeting everyone!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Nina</div>
