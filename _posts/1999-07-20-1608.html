&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Note:  Jeffery LaCroix is a veterinarian with an office in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wilmington. He writes a column for the Morning Star called <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;From Paws to Tails.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is his response to a letter regarding bathing a cat:)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Dr. LaCroix:  I&#39;ve heard that cats never have to be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; bathed, and that they have some sort of special enzyme in <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; their saliva that keeps them clean.  This doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; believable to me because there are definite &quot;kitty&quot; odors <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; on my couch and dirty cat paw prints on our white hearth.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this true about the saliva?  If we do decide to give<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Nice Kitty&quot; a bath, how do we do that? - NSP, Wilmington<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear NSP:  Fortunately for you, several years ago a client<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; gave me a written set of instructions about cat bathing <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; which I am privileged to share with you:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cat Bathing As A Martial Art<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; A.  Know that although the cat has the advantage of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the advantage of strength.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t try to bathe him in an open area where he can force <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you to chase him.  Pick a very small bathroom.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (A simple shower curtain will not do.  A berserk<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a politician can shift positions.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; B.  Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; remove all the skin from your body.  Your advantage here <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; yourself.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.  Use the element of surprise.  Pick up your cat<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire.  They have <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; little or no interest in fashion as a rule.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; D.  Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; survival.  In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; E.  Cats have no handles.  Add the fact that he now has<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; seconds at a time.  When you have him, however, you must  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like crazy.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; He&#39;ll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; latherings, so don&#39;t expect too much.)<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; F.  Next, the cat must be dried.  Novice cat bathers always<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; getting really determined.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; just been through.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; your right leg.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; towel and wait.  (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; clinging to the top of your army helmet.  If this happens, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; encourage him toward your leg.)  After all the water is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; down and dry the cat.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; your leg.  He will usually have nothing to say for about <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; back to you.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; stare of a plaster figurine.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; You will be tempted to assume he is angry.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This isn&#39;t usually the case.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to give him a bath.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; But at least now he smells a lot better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
