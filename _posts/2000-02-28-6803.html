&lt;&lt;&gt;I know of a site where folks post rebate info, special deals<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my sister has a great site at www.clevermoms.com - lots of coupon codes <br/>
<br/>
(6 or 7 of them are book stores!) separated by category  - children, <br/>
<br/>
software, toys, pets and so on - plus she will be opening a resale side <br/>
<br/>
of the site very soon where you can buy/sell gently used items - she has <br/>
<br/>
a homeschool/unschool section there -  <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy it - think you all might, too&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t I remember a news story about a frugality expert (who may have been a <br/>
homeschooling mom?) who was prosectuted for coupon redemption fraud?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good idea to make sure what you are suggesting is legal.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
