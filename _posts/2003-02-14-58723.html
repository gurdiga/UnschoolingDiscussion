<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410521371">I know it&#39;s fun to imagine Sandra as some sort of latter-day Pied Piper on<br/>
Steroids leading us mindless rats around by our collective brown noses, but<br/>
it also is not the purpose of this list to delve into our sycophancy, real<br/>
or (I beg leave to assure you) imagined.<br/>
<br/>
This list is not Sandra & Cohorts (WHY am I always a cohort and never a<br/>
hort?!) vs The Good Guys, this list is a bunch of individual moms (and a few<br/>
dads) with ideas of their own.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s a radical notion for any of us who went to junior high school,<br/>
but this isn&#39;t about who&#39;s cool, it&#39;s about who can best communicate their<br/>
points of view.<br/>
<br/>
But on topic, I beg you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; You may have to Say this, but there are more than a few of us  on this<br/>
&gt;&gt; list including myself, who have had about enough of the tactics of some<br/>
&gt;&gt; if its members.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Sandra has quite the following here, I am not surprised<br/>
&gt;&gt; how many jump into to defend her.<br/>
&gt;&gt; And in fact, all of you followers are getting very good at her games.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The one that I enjoy, is taking someones post completely out of its<br/>
&gt;&gt; text, and bashing them as a parent.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Another, is the &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you are saying game?&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Or the biggie, game of  YOU USED A WORD WE DON&#39;T APPROVE OF.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  Since when does someone dictate what words used in order<br/>
&gt;&gt; to convey ones thoughts Because Sandra sets the standards?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I would think twice if I was following someone who set my standards.<br/>
&gt; Chose what words I could use, and what I could or couldn&#39;t do with my kids. </span></blockquote></div>

Well here we are, real people, really speaking on this list and telling <br/>
stories about our lives. I&#39;ve disagreed and had lengthy in depth discussion <br/>
with all of these good folk, but never felt the need to stay on a list where <br/>
I absolutely couldn&#39;t stand the people there or the strongest voices.<br/>
All these phantom people that email you are on an email list but too scared <br/>
to post?<br/>
This isn&#39;t required reading.<br/>
No one is going to grade you or fail you if you don&#39;t come here.<br/>
There is a big wide world of internet lists out there to suit everyone...why <br/>
oh why would all these invisible people stay if they don&#39;t even want to <br/>
learn, or read or write?<br/>
I really, really wish you and your cohorts would make your own list and let <br/>
this one get back to the lively, enjoyable flow of learning about unschooling.<br/>
Hate it as much as you want, that&#39;s free CHOICE.<br/>
But let us enjoy the list as it IS.<br/>
It is what it is....let it be.<br/>
PLEASE<br/>

&lt;&lt; I still get pissed sometimes when I read certain things, but I realize<br/>
 now that I&#39;m angry for a reason.  And I think about the information<br/>
 being passed on to me by people who have more experience, and I&#39;m<br/>
 grateful to them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know what? I still get pissed once in a while too...not about the <br/>
premises of unschooling and how that affects all areas of life, that&#39;s all <br/>
sunk in fairly good (although I have to resist my conditioning often enough).<br/>
The posts that get under my skin now are ANNE O&#39;S. BIG admission here, <br/>
because I love her dearly, and I love her positive force in the world.<br/>
But sometimes, I think &quot;Oh C&#39;mon, get a dose of reality&quot; when she&#39;s being all <br/>
light and love and peace in the face of negativity.<br/>
And you know why?<br/>
Because she&#39;s evolved further on her spiritual path than I have.<br/>
She&#39;s able to have qualities I would like to better posses.<br/>
So it irks me because it&#39;s where I need to grow....and I often see that after <br/>
I think about it.<br/>
The irritating posts are the ones that make me feel inadequate.....because <br/>
that IS where I&#39;m weak.  No one likes to be reminded where they&#39;re weak.<br/>
But it&#39;s the first step to growing and changing and doing better.<br/>
So thanks Anne, and Mary and Sandra and Joyce and Kelly and Pam and everyone <br/>
that has made me think, and think, and think til my brain hurt and caused me <br/>
to be a better person because of that thinking and growing.<br/>
Thank you Anne, for getting under my skin and making me realize I need MORE <br/>
love, MORE joy and better skills for dealing with angst.<br/>
Love ya!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I unsubbed in anger a few times over the past few years, but the stuff I<br/>
read here sunk in. I may have hated the advice (even if it wasn&#39;t<br/>
directed toward me) but I took most of it to heart.  Our family has<br/>
changed for the better, a lot due to Sandra (and Mary, and Ren, and<br/>
Joyce, and Pam, and etc...) and I have never thanked any of them for it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like this kind of belated feedback after a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I talk to someone I knew when I was younger (or little) and we&#39;ll <br/>
get to telling a story, and say &quot;Remember, when we were twelve...&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Remember, when I lived in Santa Fe, and you...&quot; and I&#39;ve given and gotten <br/>
positive feedback sometimes for stuff from years and years ago.  I just love <br/>
it.  It&#39;s like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle that&#39;s been out a long, long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m sure. My name is Teresa Blalock.  But, every often I do get accused <br/>
of being &quot;someone else&quot; who faced up to Sandra.  Sorry folks, its not one <br/>
person posing as many.  I&#39;m not Ned , or Yol, or Sherry, or Bridget. Let me <br/>
see, someone asked me if I was, or if I &quot;knew&quot; some other lady from NC, I <br/>
cant recall her name ... actually I think it was a couple of ladies who also <br/>
went and made their own group. Maybe one of them was Bridget.    <br/>
<br/>
For folks that only read what I write in response to Sandra. I will once <br/>
again answer the question of why I stay here.  I&#39;ve answered it over and over <br/>
and over, but evidently, no one reads those posts I write.  I get accused of <br/>
writing negative stuff, disrupting the list, throwing tantrums. When in <br/>
reality, I write about a lot more than in defense of myself against Sandra.  <br/>
I suppose if I am not arguing with Sandra, or defending myself, my posts are <br/>
not worthy to read.  I&#39;ve been told I write too confidently.  I&#39;ve been told <br/>
to &quot;be quiet&quot; I&#39;ve been told to ignore stuff that doesn&#39;t suit me.  And, I&#39;ve <br/>
been asked MANY MANY times, why I stay here, why don&#39;t I start my own list.  <br/>
Well, the most recent response I made to those questions was on Feb 10th. <br/>
I&#39;ll just copy it for inquiring minds who skipped over it when I posted it. <br/>
or maybe they read it and just &quot;forgot.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
____________<br/>
I can only speak for myself. I can just as easily call myself &quot;eclectic&quot; <br/>
or relaxed or whatever term may best fit my style of parenting and <br/>
homeschooling. No one term is better or worse in my opinion. I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
called a &#39;school at home&quot; person, because, I don&#39;t do school at home. I&#39;ve <br/>
said before, that I find labels restrictive and I don&#39;t feel I fit any one <br/>
&#39;way&quot; of doing things. It doesn&#39;t&#39; offend me that folks here may say. OH <br/>
OH. You&#39;re not a REAL TRUE unschooler. Just like I&#39;m not offended if folks <br/>
say. OH, your not a real true Christian because I don&#39;t subscribe to their <br/>
fundamental beliefs 100% (or heck, even 50%). I stay around this group <br/>
because its active, there are lots of GOOD advice here, and I have made some <br/>
friends. For unschooling information, ( which is what I look for, even if <br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;there&quot; yet) this group has consistently been the best source I have <br/>
found. That&#39;s why I hang around here. Folks can call me eclectic or relaxed <br/>
or &quot;unschooling modified&quot; LOL.. ( although, I don&#39;t INTEND to modify <br/>
unschooling in my home. its just I&#39;m lower on the continuum and still <br/>
learning). I know I&#39;ve been called much worse :-)<br/>
<br/>
Teresa<br/>
____________________<br/>
<br/>
As far as why so many other lurk. I can only assume its because they also get <br/>
GOOD information.  They take it and sort through it and use what is helpful <br/>
to them.  Others come forward occasionally to say that they are lurkers and <br/>
they just want to thank Sandra and pat her on the back. Of course they do <br/>
that publicly.  Folks aren&#39;t gonna come out and say they get lots of good <br/>
stuff EXCEPT for Sandra&#39;s. They know how that would be received.  Everyone is <br/>
not a glutton for punishment or has those balls of steel like me.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
said several times before that I gain a lot of insight, learn a lot about <br/>
unschooling, and find much of what Sandra says useful.  I just don&#39;t find it <br/>
useful for her to have such an in your face, I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong, attitude <br/>
and to personally attack folks under the guise of &quot;generally helping&quot; folks.  <br/>
Maybe that works for some people, but for most, its a detriment to the <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.  I&#39;ve compared Sandras radical unschooling to that of <br/>
a radical Christian.  She likes to insult and attack Christians for their <br/>
tactics in trying to convert others, but she utilizes the same methods.  They <br/>
don&#39;t work.  Just like the bible thumper dressed in biblical costume, holding <br/>
up signs, standing on the street corner, shouting at sinners to REPENT, <br/>
screaming out scripture about hellfire and damnation does NOT persuade others <br/>
to turn to Jesus.  In fact it causes others to turn against Christianity.   I <br/>
think the tactics that Sandra and her close followers use have the same <br/>
effect on &quot;passersby &quot; that might have thought they wanted to be unschoolers, <br/>
until they got it shoved down their throat evangelical style <br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ll run spell check for the grammar and spelling perfectionists)<br/>
<br/>
OK got all the typos and commas in. Hope that helps... BTW, I am an excellent <br/>
speller, terrible typist.<br/>

That&#39;s a pretty negative belief.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**I suppose if I am not arguing with Sandra, or defending myself, my<br/>
posts are not worthy to read.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with this, either.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fed up with slams against Sandra, but I&#39;m happy to read your other stuff.<br/>

It ALWAYS disrupts the list when you feel the need to tell us all how <br/>
Sandra is picking on you, Teresa. Knowing Sandra as I do, I find that <br/>
idea almost laughable. It isn&#39;t true. Sandra can&#39;t even keep track of <br/>
who is who, to be honest. She doesn&#39;t even remember from one time to <br/>
the next that you&#39;re the same person. She doesn&#39;t even see the names at <br/>
the tops of the posts. She responds to each post&#39;s ideas. It isn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;you&quot; personally - but your ideas she is responding to, each and every <br/>
time this comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Please just use your delete key -- or even better, sort all messages <br/>
from Sandra directly into your trash folder. Nobody will care if you <br/>
read them or not and you won&#39;t have to feel &quot;picked on.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just thought of something else.  I have an ex who used to be able to &quot;push<br/>
my buttons&quot; almost any time he wanted to.  Even though I had sworn that I<br/>
would never subject my kids to an ugly divorce, that&#39;s what they lived<br/>
through.  I even knew he was pushing my buttons, but I wasn&#39;t able to stop<br/>
responding to it until I realized just exactly what the button was that he<br/>
was pushing.  Even though I didn&#39;t care what he thought of me as a person<br/>
(he believed all kinds of things which weren&#39;t true, and I was never going<br/>
to change those beliefs) I still cared about his opinion of me as a parent!<br/>
Once I realized how important it was *to him* that I be a bad parent (to<br/>
justify the things he was doing to keep me and my daughter apart - we each<br/>
had custody of one of the kids) I was able to disconnect the button he&#39;d<br/>
been pushing.  That was the end of our screaming matches.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m *not* saying that Sandra is trying to push Teresa&#39;s buttons.  But<br/>
if she were, I&#39;m guessing that the main button would be Teresa&#39;s belief in<br/>
herself as a good parent.  The things Sandra writes *seem* (to Teresa<br/>
anyway) to be saying that Teresa isn&#39;t a good parent.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s<br/>
what&#39;s actually happening, but it seems as if Teresa is reacting that way.<br/>
Teresa, maybe you could simply decide that you really don&#39;t care what Sandra<br/>
thinks of you, or even the rest of the list, for that matter.  If you are<br/>
getting some good advice here, which would be the only reason to stay, just<br/>
focus on that.  You have the power to react or not.  It&#39;s yours.<br/>

&quot;What you think of me is none of my business.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545757776">Lanora, Jonathan and I were at the park yesterday when Lanora and I began to make whistles with grass.  Jonathan, fully impressed, tried doing the same thing and it didn&#39;t work.  I asked him if he would like me to show him how I was doing it and he said yes.  I spent a few seconds showing him how I put the grass between my thumbs while he listened intently.  Suddenly and politely he said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough teaching!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got a good laugh but realized that, being only unschooled, he sees &quot;teaching&quot; as something he can access and turn off at will, a tool and not something he is subjected to.  Yeah!!<br/>
