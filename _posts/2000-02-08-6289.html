<div id="ygrps-yiv-214859015">I am Pagan and Wiccan to boot...have been so for almost 15 years now...<br/>
<br/>
Just before I turned 14, I dedicated myself to serving the Goddess (yes I <br/>
call Her God for short and to appease the mainstream...apparently if what one <br/>
beleives does not sound like, look like, or seem like what they believe then <br/>
one is faithless)<br/>
<br/>
I have had many instances in my life in which She has walked with me, guided <br/>
me, provided for me, and has allowed me to learn the error of my ways.<br/>
<br/>
I am not particularly raising my children to be Pagan or Wiccan...I hope that <br/>
I am raising them to seek out God and the devine in their every day lives and <br/>
to find a way to interpret divinity that makes sense to them.  So far they <br/>
have a hodge podge of information about several religions.<br/>
<br/>
I have had some experience working with a Wiccan Church coordinating and <br/>
producing events specifically for children...That was when I was living is <br/>
Seattle.  Since moving back to Arizona two years ago I haven&#39;t made it a <br/>
point to get involved with other Wiccan groups.  At least not yet...<br/>
<br/>
Would their be any other pagan families located here in Sunny Arizona?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s us too.  I hope to let my cildren find what their spirituality means<br/>
to them and discover their beliefs for themselves.  I believe personal<br/>
spirituality to be a very intimate and very complex emotional issue and I<br/>
do not believe in indoctrinating my children before they are old enough to<br/>
reason and make the decision for themselves based on thier own feelings.<br/>
My husband and I will share our beliefs with our children when they are<br/>
interested, but always on the understanding that their participation is<br/>
strictly voluntary.  It can be so crippling to a person finding their own<br/>
spirituality and meaning in life to be completely immersed and drowning in<br/>
their parent&#39;s religion, to the exclusion of even learning about other<br/>
beliefs, when they may not find true soul satisfatction in that religion.<br/>
They learn to distrust ALL religions and seek a life with no magic and no<br/>
mystery, everything concrete and mundane.<br/>
