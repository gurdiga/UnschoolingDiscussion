<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724581601">**It also has Jack Black and Conan<br/>
O&#39;Brien, two other guys Marty really likes.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read two surprisingly good reviews of the new Jack Black movie, <br/>
School of Rock (?).  It&#39;s set in a private school, so if anyone has seen <br/>
it, I&#39;d be interested in a review from the unschooling POV.<br/>
