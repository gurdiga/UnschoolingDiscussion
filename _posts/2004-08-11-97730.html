Program for 2003-2004<br/>
<br/>
In the last 18 mos., we embarked on a program of unschooling. C has always =<br/>
been a <br/>
willing student, eager to do whatever asked of her. Still, we decided that =<br/>
she thrives when <br/>
allowed to follow her particular fascinations (of which she has many).<br/>
<br/>
In the school year of 2003-2004, C spent her time in the following ways:<br/>
<br/>
TV Viewing<br/>
C is keenly interested in the construction of the situation-comedy. She can=<br/>
 be heard <br/>
throughout the house imitating her favorite characters and actors. She has =<br/>
been known to <br/>
tell me what makes one show effective and what makes another trite or predi=<br/>
ctable. She is <br/>
able to identify stereotypical characters, caricature and bad dialog. She a=<br/>
lso has developed <br/>
an unbelievable vocabulary that I can only attribute to TV. She&#39;s really cl=<br/>
ever with irony <br/>
and puns. One of my favorite comments of hers: &quot;All the Disney villains are=<br/>
 so <br/>
predictable.&quot; She went on to elucidate the qualities that make a Disney vil=<br/>
lain. J Go C!<br/>
<br/>
Bird Watching<br/>
C loved watching birds with us this year (Project Feeder Watch). She has le=<br/>
arned to identify <br/>
most backyard birds and helped with recording which ones visited the feeder=<br/>
. She also <br/>
helped us stock the feeder with seed.<br/>
<br/>
Reading and Language Arts<br/>
C is learning to read. She is still working on the phonics of reading and h=<br/>
as made lots of <br/>
progress, though she still isn&#39;t reading fluently.  We&#39;ve used some workboo=<br/>
ks (Explode the <br/>
Code) because she likes to write in them, but mostly learn phonetics using =<br/>
techniques <br/>
shown to me by a reading specialist.  She loves to write and has filled ood=<br/>
les of notebooks <br/>
with letters and &quot;writing&quot; that is her own. She&#39;s working through the Frog =<br/>
and Toad series <br/>
right now reading a little bit each week.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read aloud to her from the Girls of Many Lands books (from American Gi=<br/>
rl) and we&#39;ve <br/>
enjoyed creating question and answer games for those. She easily narrates t=<br/>
he contents <br/>
when asked about the stories.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite moments came when she set up her five dolls on a special=<br/>
ly designed, <br/>
tiered stand. She put the English doll in the middle and at first had the I=<br/>
ndian (India) doll <br/>
next to her. C exclaimed: &quot;Wait. I can&#39;t put the India doll next to England=<br/>
. They hate each <br/>
other.&quot; She began to remind me of the conflicts between India and England t=<br/>
hat we had <br/>
read about in the book. Then she had to decide who could be next to England=<br/>
 since China <br/>
and France also had histories with the British that included war.<br/>
<br/>
She enjoys a wide variety of literature and we read aloud every day.<br/>
<br/>
She also participated in our language games that produced limericks and scr=<br/>
ounged <br/>
poetry. She loves to read and learn poems.<br/>
<br/>
I read the last three Harry Potter books aloud to the kids during our read =<br/>
aloud times in <br/>
addition to reading poetry. And we make nearly weekly library visits.<br/>
<br/>
In co-op, she studied the Beatrix Potter books and created several projects=<br/>
 that detailed <br/>
BP&#39;s work. She easily narrated to me what she learned and what she enjoyed.=<br/>
 She also took <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s Read and Write.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Math<br/>
For math, we took an eclectic approach. C did do some of the Miquon math bo=<br/>
oks I have <br/>
for her and J bought her two traditional math books from the supermarket. B=<br/>
ut C finds the <br/>
abstract concepts harder to grasp that way so we use them only intermittent=<br/>
ly (she likes <br/>
writing in &quot;official books&quot; but they often hinder more than help). More oft=<br/>
en, we used math <br/>
books like: [I]Family Math[/I], [I]The I Hate Mathematics Book[/I] and othe=<br/>
r resources from <br/>
the library. We also used the Internet for creative math ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Several games helped to reinforce math concepts:<br/>
Monopoly<br/>
Poison<br/>
Dots<br/>
Yahtzee<br/>
Lentil Measuring<br/>
Managing her money<br/>
Counting games<br/>
<br/>
C is also endlessly fascinated with patterns. Currently she has an entire c=<br/>
ollection of cut <br/>
outs from magazines that she pins to a bulletin board in endless arrangemen=<br/>
ts based on <br/>
their similarities and differences. She might put all the long skinny model=<br/>
s in one corner <br/>
and all the short square ones in another. Then she matches the &quot;bling bling=<br/>
&quot; (jewelry) to <br/>
go with them based on color or shape or size.<br/>
<br/>
She constantly organizes the house, her room and her belongings into arrang=<br/>
ements <br/>
based on her need to see patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Greek<br/>
Amazingly, though C can&#39;t yet read English fluently, she is fascinated by a=<br/>
ncient Greek and <br/>
has learned the alphabet. We&#39;ve worked on both lower case and upper case le=<br/>
tters as well <br/>
as knowing how to pronounce the names of the letters. She has her own Greek=<br/>
 notebook <br/>
and keeps a list of our names written in Greek. We sometimes spend several =<br/>
days in a row <br/>
working on Greek and then take some time off. She&#39;s always interested in do=<br/>
ing more.<br/>
<br/>
Sports<br/>
C played soccer in both fall and spring. And she took gym during co-op. She=<br/>
 swims at the <br/>
YMCA and she danced this summer in a ballet five-week workshop as well. One=<br/>
 thing I like <br/>
about C and sports is that she is highly motivated to practice at home. We =<br/>
play soccer in <br/>
the backyard and she loves to dance in the living room using books from the=<br/>
 library to <br/>
guide her.<br/>
<br/>
History/Geography<br/>
The American Girl books from India, China, and Turkey were our primary reso=<br/>
urces for <br/>
history this year. We learned about the Indian revolt against Britain (1939=<br/>
), the Opium War <br/>
in Canton (1857), and we studied life in a harem in Turkey (1720).<br/>
<br/>
C turned her knowledge into a card game making questions and answers for th=<br/>
e details of <br/>
the books. She played with the dolls as well as identified the places menti=<br/>
oned in the <br/>
books on the globe.<br/>
<br/>
We watched &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; many, many times too. J That movie combin=<br/>
ed her love <br/>
of Britain, soccer and India. <br/>
<br/>
She participated in our geography work from &quot;Map the World by Heart.&quot; She l=<br/>
earned about <br/>
longitude and latitude as well as flags. She tasted Chinese food for the fi=<br/>
rst time this year <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
We read several chapters from Story of the World and took time to read stor=<br/>
ies from 1001 <br/>
Arabian nights. The kids loved these. We did several of the projects that a=<br/>
re a part of <br/>
SOTW including a Roman banner, Chinese lanterns and clay pots. We also look=<br/>
ed at maps.<br/>
<br/>
Art<br/>
C loves art so we watched the Sister Wendy video series again. We visited t=<br/>
he art museum <br/>
many times and she took art at the co-op. She&#39;s prolific with design type d=<br/>
rawings <br/>
preferring them to portraits and people.<br/>
<br/>
Films/TV<br/>
&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;<br/>
&quot;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot; (and a repeat of the whole trilogy =<br/>
including hours <br/>
and hours and hours of behind the scenes material about film making, script=<br/>
 writing etc.)<br/>
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;<br/>
&quot;Newsies&quot; (musical about the history of newspapers in the late 1800s in NYC=<br/>
)<br/>
&quot;Tornadoes&quot;  History of tornadoes<br/>
&quot;Sinbad&quot;  she loves mythology so we had fun with this since it related to =<br/>
our reading of <br/>
the 1001 Arabian Nights.</div>
