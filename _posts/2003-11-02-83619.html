Yeah! This was probably the third (?) Halloween with no candy restrictions on <br/>
my part. (except that Darin or I have to check it first) The first year was <br/>
hell (for me) because they gorged. Last year wasn&#39;t so bad, they had it eaten <br/>
in about a week, better than the year before. This year, and it is only the <br/>
first night after, but so far I think there has only been five or six pieces <br/>
eaten from each bag. Not that I am counting, but since the only rule is they have <br/>
to let me check the candy before they eat it, I see how much has been eaten. <br/>
Some might say it took three years to get to this point, but I say the candy <br/>
only lasts a few weeks and it is only once a year so by my count this only took <br/>
about a month. &lt;g&gt; Three years ago they wouldn&#39;t have shared or wanted to <br/>
unless forced. The bags would have been each placed in separate areas with lots of <br/>
&quot;This is MY bag&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t forget this is where MY bag goes.&quot; This year the <br/>
bags haven&#39;t moved from the coffee table and I don&#39;t think I could tell which <br/>
Walmart bag was Moly&#39;s or Jack&#39;s and I doubt they could either. Three years <br/>
ago there would have been careful counting and inventory taken, making sure each <br/>
got the lions share of the wealth, this year they have just reached in when <br/>
the mood struck and picked what they wanted and left the rest. <br/>
Another small step!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462781897">Just a few comments on the Halloween candy...I have always just let the kids<br/>
have the candy when and how they want.  They love to dump it all out and<br/>
line up the stuff in their own little catagories.  They eat a few pieces<br/>
while they are doing this but are more interested in getting it all sorted.<br/>
Then they have an elaborate system of swapping items between the two of<br/>
them, etc. Well, this year, we got to do this with my sister and her 2 1/2<br/>
year old.  He thought this was really something!  He went to these houses<br/>
and they threw candy in a bag for him.  It really must be a pretty awesome<br/>
thing to experience this for the first time as a little kid! &lt;bg&gt; But when<br/>
we got back to the house, his mom swooped in and took the bag and said he<br/>
couldn&#39;t have that until the next day because she didn&#39;t want him to eat the<br/>
candy in the late evening.  How frustrating!!  He just got all these<br/>
interesting, colorful little packages all thrown together in a bag and now<br/>
he can&#39;t LOOK at it?!  So, I told her to let him look at the stuff and show<br/>
her what he got, etc.  She reluctantly let him and guess what?  He looked it<br/>
all over...showed everybody...ate HALF of a little candy bar and was done.<br/>
My sister is a very controlling person and she was quite amazed that he<br/>
didn&#39;t eat everything.  I explained to her that he didn&#39;t WANT to eat<br/>
everything...he just wanted to see it!<br/>
Why are some moms so controlling?  I find it sooo frustrating.  With my<br/>
sister, I could just butt in &lt;bg&gt; but with others, I just watch in dismay.<br/>
Sorry this got so long, Lisa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537023627">My boys were ready to stop half way through trick or treating, my <br/>
daughter  wasn&#39;t.  So we headed in the direction of home, with her <br/>
stopping at the houses and them just standing there waiting for her <br/>
to go on.  At first, I let them just stand there and would take their <br/>
pumpkins up to the houses for them, thinking that even if they were <br/>
to tired to climb the stairs to the porches, they would appreciate <br/>
still getting the candy.   But my 6 year old  kept saying, &quot;Mommy, i <br/>

I agree!  It was really amazing to see play out in my kids, too.  It was COLD <br/>
and snowy here and the kids didn&#39;t do much trick or treating (4 blocks).  I <br/>
would have been sorely disappointed in the candy haul, but they were just <br/>
grateful for the *free* candy!  They went out with their *best bud* and his <br/>
brother, so mom got to stay inside and hang out with the grownups (rare treat!).  The <br/>
whole evening&#39;s celebrations were far more important than the amount of candy <br/>
they received.  <br/>
I was horribly broke this past week and had no money for treats; to pacify <br/>
them, I told them they could eat all the candy they wanted on Halloween ... They <br/>
really liked the chips and salsa, ate chili with crackers and cheese and, oh <br/>
yeah, about three small candybars each &lt;bg&gt; What a great night for <br/>
breakthroughs!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187803831">I offered to take mine to the store and just buy them a bunch of candy, but they wanted to dress up and go trick or treat in our neighborhood.  I am &quot;costume impaired&quot;.  Jackie decided to be a telletubbie by wearing her telletubbie pajamas with a layer of clothes underneath and a pillow to make her tummie fat.  Lisa couldn&#39;t decide.  I was racking my brains trying to think what we had laying around that could become a costume.  I remembered that we have some reflective vests, so I suggested she wear that and carry a stop flag (easily made with computer and an old broom handle) and practically everybody recognized her as a school crossing guard.  Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
They are eating the candy throughout the day but are eating plenty of other stuff too.  Yesterday the neighbor girl was over all day.  When her mom called to have her come home, she (the mom) told me that her 3 kids put all their candy together in one bowl, decided how long they wanted the candy to last, then figured out how many pieces that could each have per day.  After Allison went home, Jackie told me that she had said they are only allowed to eat 2 pieces of candy per day.  I told Jackie what the mom had told me, saying that she had said it was the kid&#39;s idea to do that.  Jackie said that wasn&#39;t how Allison made it sound.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the 2 piece rule this morning when Jackie opened a pack of starbursts, but they weren&#39;t the flavor she likes.  I said just toss those back in the bowl and open another package.  Yesterday she&#39;d taken a bite of a candy and didn&#39;t like it.  I said throw it away and grab something else.  I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t have to eat a flavor she didn&#39;t like just because it was part of her daily allotment.<br/>

Isn&#39;t Halloween Grand!??  I love it.  I love watching the kids run around the <br/>
house, each with their enormous bag, trading, swapping, counting, going from <br/>
room to room, comparing who&#39;s still got the most, who&#39;s gobbling theirs down, <br/>
who&#39;s making theirs last the longest...<br/>

I had things to do all day and I couldn&#39;t take the kids with me. (well I <br/>
could have, but they would have been bored to tears) They packed bags and games <br/>
and went off to work with Darin. As I was walking out I realized I only had a <br/>
few dollars to hand out for snack and drink runs so I grabbed a bag of candy off <br/>
the coffee table and took it out to the car. As I handed it to Moly I had a <br/>
momentary thought that maybe this might not be a good idea because one bag <br/>
would be eaten out of and the kids might fight doing the &quot;this is my bag&quot; thing. <br/>
But I put that thought out of my head because things have been going so good <br/>
and why should I think something negative? (does anyone else think my kids are <br/>
further on this path than me? &lt;g&gt;) I went on with my day. This evening I asked <br/>
Darin how his day went with the kids at work with him and specifically asked <br/>
about the candy. He told me that they both came to him about three and asked <br/>
for the keys to the car and that they came back with just a few pieces each and <br/>
a pocket full each to give to the &quot;guys&quot; who work for Darin. No mention that <br/>
Mom only brought one bag or that it was Moly&#39;s bag or Jack&#39;s bag. If it were me <br/>
in that situation I would have carried the bag in with me, never let anyone <br/>
else touch it, never shared especially with adults, and probably would have <br/>
eaten as much as I could before it was taken from me. <br/>

yes. &lt;vbg&gt; Jack got a No Jesus No peace, Know Jesus Know peace one.<br/>
