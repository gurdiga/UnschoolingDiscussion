<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104258507">woops, one last thought, and this is on the catering to husbands out of guilt <br/>
that you are having such freedom with your time...  <br/>
we can certainly appreciate the sacrifices our spouses make to provide us the <br/>
opp. to be with our children!  but we can empower them to change if they are <br/>
miserable, to benefit their quality of life, too --OR not cater out of guilt, <br/>
but out of true appreciation for that loving providing that he is doing!!!!<br/>
if we do feel guilty for having our freedom, it may be then fostering an <br/>
underlying resentment on his part...  sometimes we dont see our days turning <br/>
into years very well, a quote that struck me well is &quot;the way we spend our <br/>
days is the way we spend our lives.&quot;  (that is a good one to shake any of us <br/>
up, esp after spending a couple hours in front of the computer!!!)  <br/>
for all of us, listing the costs and benefits of our choices helps to clarify <br/>
if we are really where we need to be at this place in time.  then we can <br/>
offer our support whole-heartedly if a person decides to make changes OR if <br/>
they realize that where they are isnt so bad afterall and is actually <br/>
allowing some pretty great things to happen in their family and-- without <br/>
them--those things would stop!!!   <br/>

also, another book you may already be familiar with is &quot;what color is your <br/>
parachute?&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250517308">Something my husband and I did was ask each other, when he came home each <br/>
day, &quot;What can I do to make your day better?&quot; This helped tremendously, and <br/>
there was always something I would&#39;ve never thought of!! It has helped ease <br/>
the trouble of thinking you&#39;re doing the right thing when it really isn&#39;t and <br/>
getting incredibly frustrated.<br/>
Blessings to all, Lori in TX</div>

Lori,<br/>
    That is another good idea!  Now I just hope I can remember it each day, <br/>
in the rush of everything else we have planned.  I think we have too much <br/>
&quot;stuff and activities&quot; in our life right now.  I don&#39;t know how it got this <br/>
way.  We purposely slowed down our life a couple of years ago, when we <br/>
started unschooling (you know---simplify, simplify), but somehow things are <br/>
getting out of control again.  It isn&#39;t so much &quot;activities&quot; as it is that <br/>
more and more people have &quot;needed&quot; something.  You feel like you should be <br/>
helping and then before you know it your life has gotten out of control as <br/>
you run here one night and there another.  We need to slow down and focus on <br/>
us again.  (I don&#39;t mean that those people don&#39;t have legitimate needs.  They <br/>
do!  And I like helping them.  But when you help one person on Monday nights, <br/>
another on Tuesdays, someone else on Wednesdays, run errands or help with <br/>
errands for someone on Thursdays, then keep someones kids all weekend so they <br/>
can work---well that leaves no time for family!!  Somehow, I am going to have <br/>
to renegotiate.  We have over expanded ourselves again!)<br/>
