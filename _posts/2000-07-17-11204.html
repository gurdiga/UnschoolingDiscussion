<div id="ygrps-yiv-867678159">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I just moved to Mississippi. I love it! I&#39;m at my parents house <br/>
right now - I don&#39;t have a computer in my apartment yet. Anyway, I <br/>
think somebody wrote to me before, but, is there anybody who knows <br/>
any homeschoolers in Meridian, MS? Everybody is so into day care and <br/>
sending kids off to school early, etc., here. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m so happy to be back in the States. DH is still in Japan <br/>
looking for a job here.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I&#39;m back!<br/>
<br/>
Melanie in Japan</div>
