<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960390936">Dawn, your confusion comes from missing the post Rachel was replying to. See<br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
       Excellent point.  Those who founded the country were quite obviously<br/>
  opposed to a church-state but for some reason, those who would want one<br/>
now<br/>
  sometimes see themselves as more truly AMERICAN than people whose beliefs<br/>
  differ from the founders in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
          Lucy<br/>
<br/>
 This was where the idea of Christians being &quot;more&quot; American came from that<br/>
Rachel was replying to. I am responding because Rachel has left the group<br/>
according to her last post.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want a political party saying that for *women* (in<br/>
particular) raising children is for the &quot;greater good&quot;. It sounds one step<br/>
removed from insisting that&#39;s what women must do.<br/>
<br/>
And looking over that stuff, with the words of violence and hate used in<br/>
support of their cause, it doesn&#39;t seem that far removed from some of bin<br/>
Laden&#39;s reasoning for what he&#39;s done in the past.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s promulgating one way of thinking. It doesn&#39;t sound much different than<br/>
the type of speech that kept the Russian people submissive to the<br/>
government. Gives me the shivers.<br/>
