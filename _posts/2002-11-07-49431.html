<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273222973">If I am following all these qualifications of what it means to be<br/>
a fundamentalist christian, insofar as the term is used here, you<br/>
must have these characteristics:<br/>
<br/>
- you believe in corporal punishment of children as a virtue<br/>
- you believe that the wife should in all things submit to the<br/>
husband<br/>
- you believe that every one who disagrees with your religious<br/>
views will go to Hell<br/>
- you believe that your church pastor is always right<br/>

<br/>
Have I missed anything?  Must all or some number be present?<br/>
Have I misstated any?<br/>
<br/>
The rationalization of what appears to be semi regular Christian<br/>

me to understand what people mean by the term.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271971899">I&#39;m on a couple of catholic lists and bible discussion lists, and on <br/>
those lists, there are complaints that the term &quot;christian&quot; has come to <br/>
mean &quot;fundamentalist christian&quot; rather than &quot;follower of christ&quot;.   <br/>
While a fundamentalist can be a follower of christ, a follower of christ <br/>
is by no means always a fundamentalist. Talk to a catholic, orthodox, <br/>
gnostic, liberal protestant christian -- all quite different from a <br/>
fundamentalist christian.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, a word can mean one thing to one person, and something <br/>
entirely different to someone else, and hence the misunderstandings. <br/>
Roman Catholics will of course tell you that they are Christians, but I <br/>
have met fundamentalists and read some fundamentalist writings that call <br/>
Roman Catholics many things.. such as pagan and satanist.. but say they <br/>
are not Chrisitans.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t like any bashing, no matter how strongly I disagree. <br/>
But keep in mind, certain segments of fundamentalist christians do an <br/>
awful lot of bashing to others. It&#39;s hard to show respect to someone who <br/>
comes up to your kids and tells them that they are going to hell.<br/>
<br/>
hth,<br/>
s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
btw, I thought your qualifications were pretty close to my understanding <br/>
of what a fundamentalist christian is. and I don&#39;t think folks should <br/>
say &quot;christian&quot; when they mean &quot;fundamentalist christian&quot; and even then, <br/>
there are some distinctions.<br/>

&gt; Betsy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s our group&#39;s statement of faith:<br/>
<br/>
The Bible is the inspired and infallible Word of God and constitutes <br/>
His completed and final revelation to man. The Bible, in its original <br/>
autograph, is without error in whole and in part, including <br/>
theological concepts as well as geographical and historical details. <br/>
<br/>
God has existed from all eternity in three persons: God the Father, <br/>
God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ was God in human <br/>
flesh being fully God and fully man, except without sin.<br/>
<br/>
All men are in violation of God&#39;s righteous requirements and His holy <br/>
character both by nature and act, and are therefore under His wrath <br/>
and just condemnation.<br/>
<br/>
The central purpose of the coming of Jesus Christ was to pay the <br/>
penalty for man&#39;s sin through His substitutionary atoning death on <br/>
the cross, the successful accomplishment of which was attested to by <br/>
His subsequent visible, bodily resurrection.<br/>
<br/>
Salvation is offered as a gift, free to the sinner. This gift must be <br/>
responded to by individual faith, not trusting in any personal works <br/>
whatsoever, but in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446106352">Betsy, I don&#39;t think a statement of faith is going to get to the<br/>
heart of who is a fundamentalist christian as the term used on<br/>
this list.   A statement will include things like a belief in the<br/>
Trinity that are so common to most Christians that they in no way<br/>
capture the distinguishing characteristics of &quot;fundamentalist<br/>
christians&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A good deal of the noise to signal ratio problem with religion<br/>
here seems to come from a lack of precision about who these<br/>
&quot;fundamentalist christians&quot; are - and from occasionally floating<br/>
in a particular denomination or person.  I am not trying to<br/>
describe everything about fundamentalist christianity - I don&#39;t<br/>
need to know that most have 2 legs and 5 senses, just those<br/>
things that make them ~different~ from the Christians who are not<br/>
supposed to feel bashed by the religion comments here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion though - I guess I wasn&#39;t clear enough.<br/>

-I believe that acts of violence against CHILDREN are NOT Ok, and I DO feel <br/>
their pain.<br/>
-I believe the wife should not submit to the husband whatsoever; nor he, her.<br/>

no hell.<br/>
-I believe NO church pastor.<br/>
-I believe if it feels good, do it. Yes.<br/>
-I believe that the bible is just a collection of myths and parables. Not <br/>
even a &quot;pretty&quot; good book. Many better books are available and MUCH more <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is what I believe.  The Bible says that all have sinned.  Heaven <br/>
is only for those who are completely sinless.  So even one sin makes <br/>
a person a sinner and not able to be in the presence of a holy God.  <br/>
It is good to try to be a good person, but no one can be make <br/>
themselves perfect, and perfection is what is required.  The only <br/>
thing that can bring us into the presence of a holy God (and give us <br/>
adoption as his children) is if we ask Him to forgive our sins.  That <br/>
is why Jesus--fully God (therefore sinless) and fully human died on <br/>
the cross.  When we stand before God the Father, all He will see is <br/>
that His Son&#39;s blood has covered our sins.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487696887">**Here&#39;s our group&#39;s statement of faith:**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to share the specifics.<br/>
<br/>
In all the SOFs that I read I didn&#39;t see anything that flat-out said one<br/>
has to adopt an aggressive and intolerant attitude along with the other<br/>
beliefs listed.  So, I am going to conclude that some people are just<br/>
fundamentalists, people with specific beliefs, and other people, the<br/>
louder ones &lt;g&gt;, are fundamentalists with attitude.  And when I&#39;m<br/>
describing the latter, I&#39;ll try to be more specific than using the<br/>
general term &quot;fundamentalist&quot;.  If I mean obnoxious or overbearing<br/>
people with fundamentalist beliefs, I&#39;ll try to remember to include the<br/>
adjective obnoxious (or overbearing) so that the well-behaved and<br/>
reasonable-to-get-along with fundamentalists don&#39;t think that I mean them.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not being sarcastic.  I am sincere.)<br/>

Well it depends on what type of Chrisitan one is. <br/>
<br/>
Chrisitan Catholics do belive that how we act here on earth has concequences in eternity (I sound like Maximus) that just &quot;beliving&quot; is not enough. Anyone can belive in Jesus...its what we do with that knowledge (and your accountable if you have the &quot;full truth&quot; of the faith....how our concience is formed comes into play here) that is key. So there is Purgetory to deal with our &quot;leftover&quot; sins before we can go sinless to a Holy God. Also we belive that we cannot know what all of God&#39;s provisions might be for others since man cannot grasp the mystery of God&#39;s infinate grace and mercy. I always had a hard time with the &quot;once saved&quot; explinations hard without some way for God to act in Mercy at the end depending on how a life had been lived and what information a person may have had.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are those Christians who belive in &quot;The Elect&quot;. Don&#39;t ask.... its too hard to explain.<br/>
<br/>

You can&#39;t just believe it.  You have to ASK him to save you.  You have to be <br/>
born again (in fundamentalist Christian terms, which is what the topic is, <br/>
before people drag me off and tell me what Catholics believe--I KNOW).   You <br/>
have to profess your faith and be baptised (if you live long enough).  The <br/>
moment that you &quot;let Jesus into your heart&quot; is when you&#39;re saved, but then <br/>
you accept baptism because Jesus did (it&#39;s symbolic, but it  makes you a <br/>
member of the church).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So heaven isn&#39;t for the &quot;good&quot; and hell for the &quot;bad&quot; but for those who <br/>
believe and don&#39;t believe?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Only moreso.<br/>

In my experience, they will accept adult baptism and &quot;membership transfer&quot; <br/>
from another fundamentalist church, but they won&#39;t accept infant baptism.<br/>
