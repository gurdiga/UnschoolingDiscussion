I&#39;m not sure who all your talking about but if your uncomfortable with anyone&#39;s comments you should just ignore them rather than encourage further discussion by replying. We&#39;re discussing ideas here and not particular families. If you don&#39;t like, what a person is saying or how they present their ideas, your best to use the delete key to save yourself any aggravation. I find there are quite a few interesting posts on this list but it&#39;s boring when the argument gets too personal and the discussion of issues is lost. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;I understand your frustration with what has been said and trust me when I say, they will only keep pushing your buttons and inciting <br/>

Your involved in an exchange of ideas! If your buttons are pushed I think that means your ideas are being challenged and you have an opportunity to reflect and reevaluate that&#39;s all. <br/>

It wasn&#39;t built for your &#39;convenience&#39;. Just like the internet was built for a useful purpose (communications) and then bloated out of proportion by entertainment. Just because something is there, and convenient, it doesn&#39;t become mandatory that every generation must continue to expand and increase it (can you say PCB&#39;s?).<br/>
I was mostly being facetious to make a point about government roads and bridges, and the difference between &#39;need&#39; and &#39;want&#39;.

<br/>
I&#39;m not the one teaching little Kirby the Karate fad. I don&#39;t expect anything from my kids that isn&#39;t reasonable. <br/>
<br/>
I did have a lot of experience with immaturity in the military, where 40 year old almost-retirees spend their time hanging out with 17 year old kids in bars. The view of &#39;extended puberty&#39; is blatantly obvious. Read more about our grandparents and parents&#39; lives, and imagine if our current crop of ps kids would have the maturity to do the things they did at the ages they did them. My Dad packed up 8 kids and the dog in a station wagon and moved to a frontier farm at the age of 30. (I&#39;m not saying this is the best thing, just that it took wisdom, skills, and maturity that I respect and wish I had.)<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to unschool without identifying an enemy, but then, why would you &#39;un&#39;school? As a scientific experiment with your children? What makes you think that you know so much that thousands of teachers and administrators couldn&#39;t figure out? (You already answered this, then deny it.)<br/>
<br/>
    I started the cynicism you see around you today (just call me Al Gore :-) ). It isn&#39;t &#39;stylish&#39;. It is based on a mistrust of established paradigms. &quot;Stop Paving the Cow Paths&quot;  is a common saying (and a book, I think). The reasons for mistrusting established paradigms are manyfold, but it begins with the public screw-ups of our most trusted organizations, like the federal government, Exxon, and the U.S. military. As they say on TV, &quot;Trust No One.&quot; (yes, there are reasons why the cows choose those  paths, but not related to this side of the discussion.) All organizations have someone who can screw up.<br/>
    This applies in the grand overall picture, but we know we must trust someone, so we bond with and trust the ones we know (local control), and distrust those we don&#39;t know. Love can only be had by taking the chance of free and open trust. You can&#39;t trust someone you don&#39;t know. That&#39;s just blind faith (&quot;We from da guvmint, we here to hep&quot;). Generally, I don&#39;t trust people who don&#39;t have strong opinions or enemies. They probably haven&#39;t done anything to warrant them (this rule is modified by an age factor, kids shouldn&#39;t have real enemies).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a back road to Santa Fe.  Two lanes, through dips, over very small <br/>
bridges, as dark as can possibly be with deep arroyos to fall into, not one <br/>
filling station or phone (phones if you went up to houses in the three little <br/>
former-ghost-towns, now artist-colonies it goes through).  It&#39;s not half as <br/>
safe as the interstate.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know the interstates were beefed up for military purposes. The Romans <br/>
did that too.  People COULD have travelled without Roman bridges, but once <br/>
there&#39;s a bridge, ferrymen aren&#39;t going to make much money.  But there was <br/>
Rt. 66 before there was I-40, and it wasn&#39;t considered a sin for the <br/>
government to have make pavement to California.<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque exists at the intersection of I-25 and I-40.  I-10 cuts across <br/>
the bottom of the state.  We have those, the federal court house, some <br/>
natioanal parks and monuments, and that&#39;s about it.  When I go to Washington <br/>
I&#39;m in awe of the federal funding for things everyone can see and do, and how <br/>
much easier it is to feel like an American there than it is in a place like <br/>
Espanola, where I grew up, where the BIA and BLM are the only federal <br/>
presences.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Just because something is there, and convenient, it doesn&#39;t become <br/>
mandatory that every generation must continue to expand and increase it (can <br/>
you say PCB&#39;s?).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some of the side roads were not maintained when the interstate went in.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how far you are from an interstate, but in New Mexico they are the <br/>
only way to travel from some towns to others, and especially in the southern <br/>
part of the state towns can be very far apart.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*I&#39;m&quot; the Ayn Rand in this exchange!?  I&#39;m the socialist democrat, if <br/>
anything!  You seem to be proposing privatization.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is possible to unschool without identifying an enemy, but then, why <br/>
would you &#39;un&#39;school? As a scientific experiment with your children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
In part, yes.  The schools don&#39;t have a control group.  Unless some people <br/>
prove that kids can learn to read without being taught, those trained in <br/>
colleges won&#39;t believe it.  I think my kids would learn either way.  I think <br/>
they&#39;re better off at home.  But I don&#39;t see the schools as an evil empire <br/>
that should be destroyed and and salted over.  School was good for me, <br/>
personally.  I could tell good school stories for days on end.  But schools <br/>
are bad for lots of people, in ways that might could be changed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What makes you think that you know so much that thousands of teachers and <br/>
administrators couldn&#39;t figure out? (You already answered this, then deny <br/>
it.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was one of the millions, not thousands, of teachers and administrators, <br/>
many of whom HAD figured out what worked better, but were powerless to <br/>
implement it.  John Holt was one of them.  Many of the readers of this list <br/>
have education degrees (I don&#39;t) or taught school (I did) or were school <br/>
psychologists or counselors.  They think they know much that thousands of <br/>
teachers and administrators don&#39;t WANT to figure out--many (NOT ALL) are <br/>
content to continue to take a paycheck until retirement without rocking the <br/>
boat.  It has much to do with temperament.  Lots of people are happy to do <br/>
their best within limitations and be content.  Others have the inner need to <br/>
change the limitations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Generally, I don&#39;t trust people who don&#39;t have strong opinions or enemies. <br/>

<br/>
Well I have both.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think it is impossible to trust someone you don&#39;t know but it&#39;s <br/>
desirable to mistrust those you have never met and never will meet?  I don&#39;t <br/>
see why you can&#39;t have some of both.<br/>

Because I&#39;m saying things I have reason to believe are true, I&#39;m not saying <br/>
them to be hateful, and my average stays up because I&#39;m helpful here and <br/>
other places on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget, you or anyone can say anything you want to here, and if people feel <br/>
the urge to defend you, they absolutely can and will.  I&#39;ve spent a few more <br/>
years earning  faith and trust than you have.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents are blissfully or willfully unaware of child development <br/>
realities.  They expect three year olds to make promises they keep (about <br/>
things they&#39;re incapable of understanding or performing) and promise them <br/>
then for not keeping their word.  They take six year old boys to doctors if <br/>
they can&#39;t read, instead of just waiting two or three years until they can <br/>
(during which time those boys can absolutely learn TONS of stuff from books <br/>
read to them, videos, visits to museums and historic sites, hands-on-stuff), <br/>
but instead the parents WANT a diagnosis of ADHD or dyslexis or something <br/>
scientific, so they feel like they did the right parental thing.  Moms, as a <br/>
group, seem vastly more in touch with what their kids know and can say and do <br/>
and have been doing than dads, in general, do.  If a mom had no idea if her <br/>
child could tie his shoes or not, it would seem neglect.  Dads, though, often <br/>
ask the kid or other kids whether the youngest needs help with the bathroom, <br/>
or the kids will tell dad who&#39;s needing a high chair or help reading <br/>
subtitles or whatever.  Some dads are totally up to the moment.  Others <br/>
choose not to be and few fault them; it&#39;s not their job, in this society.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty <br/>

<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to be insulting, and if someone gets nasty back to a <br/>
discussion about federal highways (which, by the way, nobody did except you), <br/>
that&#39;s their doing, not mine.  I want to discuss issues. You want to discuss <br/>
me.  I wish you&#39;d stop.<br/>

&gt; LMAO!  Someone is always on Sandra about something!  Always.  I had to<br/>
&gt; keep a box of tissue by me at all times when I first joined this list.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very funny!  Maybe she should run for God, or something.  But, we&#39;d have<br/>
&gt; to pass a test to vote.  Question # 1.  Who&#39;s always right?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course Sandra is always right.  As Sandraites,  we believe in the <br/>
infallibility of the Goddess Sandra. In our home we used to wear bracelets <br/>
that had WWSD? on them, but we have since replaced them with Thinking Sticks <br/>
glued about our clothing.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know, some describe us Sandraites as a cult, but we know it&#39;s not <br/>
true.<br/>

strangers is a path to a more serene life.)<br/>

Sandra! I went a-hunting, and sure enough, it&#39;s online at the HEM <br/>
website:<br/>
