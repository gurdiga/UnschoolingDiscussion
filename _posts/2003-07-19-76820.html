<div id="ygrps-yiv-413064345">We had temps over 100 today.  Guess we&#39;re not alone, sounds like a lot of the USA is having a heat wave.<br/>
<br/>
I joined the kids today in the wading pool and eating a lemonade popsicle.  It was very nice :-)<br/>
<br/>
We just came back from an evening bike ride, now that it&#39;s finally cool enough to exert some physical effort.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading Never Too Late by John Holt.  It has motivated me to make time for some of the things I&#39;ve been trying to do, but haven&#39;t been spending enough time at.  I will be spending less time here for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Huge thanks to everyone who has replied to my sometimes ignorant comments.  I *think* I&#39;m finally understanding unschooling, but still have lots of personal issues to work on so that I can help my kids grow up with fewer hang-ups.  I will always be grateful for the ways this list has opened my eyes, mind, and heart to so many issues regarding living with children.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is having a great summer!<br/>
