<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746766465">Hey Jennifer,<br/>
Another idea....do you think your Mom would qualify for one of those government subsidized apartments for the elderly?  I had an elderly friend who lived in one of those complexes for many years until she was unable to care for herself any longer.  If your mother can take care of herself, it may be a good option.  My friend&#39;s apartment was just a small, one bedroom, one bathroom, living room with a small porch.  Typical apartment style yards and sidewalks.  Once a week a small bus took them to the grocery, etc.  She also qualified for transportation assistance to get to the doctors, she never learned to drive.  Some of the other residents there still had a car.  <br/>
<br/>
I certainly understand being in the middle of pleasing a parent and doing what&#39;s right for your kids......are you taking any time to take care of yourself?<br/>
