<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660532345">&quot;But Kelly is right, she doesn&#39;t want to solve *her* problem.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Hello group members,<br/>
I am a newbie, and debating whether or not to stay, after having<br/>
followed the &quot;discussion&quot; arising from Mommyof8plus1&#39;s questions about<br/>
her son&#39;s reading. I have read a lot about unschooling and am just<br/>
taking my first steps into it. My understanding is that it is a<br/>
loving, accepting way of allowing one&#39;s children to blossom and flower<br/>
in their own time according to the gifts that are in them. To not<br/>
judge according to arbitrary standards, to seek to understand and<br/>
gently nourish their initiatives. But I am not seeing this philosophy<br/>
being lived out in the dialogue following Susan&#39;s questions. I see<br/>
judgement, assumptions (the above quote is an example), even some<br/>
unkind attacks. I suspect that Susan has already concluded that<br/>
sincere, supportive help is not to be found here, as the consensus<br/>
seems to be that she has not &quot;seen the light&quot; and members have taken<br/>
to discussing her rather than responding to her. Following the tone of<br/>
this discussion has shaken me, as I had been hoping to find a circle<br/>
of encouragement, support and acceptance. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll find it here.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t take it personally Tamara because it isn&#39;t personal.   This is a<br/>
discussion list not a support group and if what you are doing with your<br/>
children is disrespectful or hurtful this is the group that will point that<br/>
out to you and help you to move beyond it. (don&#39;t we all want to do better<br/>
by our children?) We are here to discuss unschooling; what it is and what it<br/>
isn&#39;t.  When people come here with an agenda already mapped out and aren&#39;t<br/>
open to changing then what is the purpose of the dialog?  The poster Momof7<br/>
was the first one to point out that she indeed was not an unschooler nor did<br/>
she want to be.  She also said<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I want my son to learn how to read. I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop <br/>
&gt; &quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they <br/>
&gt; will make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel <br/>
&gt; dumb and damage his self-esteem.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which would lead me to believe it was more about her than him.  Because if<br/>
it were only about how he felt, she would support him where he is at, not<br/>
push him to do more than he is ready for.  <br/>
<br/>
It can be painful to have our subconscious agendas pointed out to us, but<br/>
growth comes from self reflection.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479520471">I let Tamara&#39;s post through even though she only joined the list Monday.   <br/>
The guidelines for this list are pretty clear, and are sent to each new member.  <br/>
   Read a couple of weeks before posting.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect Susan&#39;s post to get good responses.   I was impressed at how <br/>
patient and generous some were with information which is honestly available <br/>
elsewhere (Joyce is a saint).   Susan had just joined the list too, and had I <br/>
been the moderator who came to her post first, I wouldn&#39;t have let it through.<br/>
<br/>
So because Susan violated the list&#39;s recommendations (which are there for <br/>
good reason), she&#39;s unhappy with the response.   She didn&#39;t know what to expect, <br/>
but had she followed the rules she would have had a much better idea.<br/>
<br/>
Tamara, also very new to the list, wrote: <br/>

<br/>
Many list members seemed to think that Susan&#39;s attitude toward her son was <br/>
not leading toward loving acceptance.   The truth is that the curriculum-using <br/>
community can&#39;t help her, because her problem can&#39;t be helped.   A child who is <br/>
not ready to read cannot learn to read no matter HOW much he wants to, no <br/>
matter how hard he is willing to &quot;work&quot; and no matter how trickly clever the <br/>
teacher is.   A baby too young to walk cannot walk no matter how much he wants to <br/>
or tries and no matter what the mom says, does, provides, threatens.   There <br/>
are many factors and it happens when it happens.   Moms can keep a baby from <br/>
learning to walk (or stall it off) but cannot induce it to happen &quot;early.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same with reading.<br/>

<br/>
Susan&#39;s not a child.   The responses were given in favor of her son, not for <br/>
the comfort of the mother.<br/>
<br/>
Now that you&#39;ve joined the list, please go to the messages and read back to <br/>
last week&#39;s discussion about emotional support.   If Susan joined for emotional <br/>
support for herself, rather than to examine how and why unschooling works, <br/>
she is needy of something this list can&#39;t provide.   And a desire for emotional <br/>
(or technical) support for using a curriculum and pressing him to &quot;want to <br/>
learn&quot; is not something this list would do anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I see judgement, assumptions...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe   the policy of not allowing posts until a person has read for two <br/>
weeks should be enforced more stringently.<br/>
<br/>

is not to be found here-=-<br/>
<br/>
If she concludes that, she will be incorrect in that assumption.<br/>

<br/>
A day and a half of reading, posting before waiting a week or two, and <br/>
judging the list based on that is your option, but it&#39;s not the best option. <br/>
<br/>
Those who have written do live out their philosophy with their children, and <br/>
they were freely and generously sharing what they KNOW to be true--that <br/>
families can live peacefully, joyfully, and children can learn to read gently and <br/>
surely in their own time.    If that&#39;s not the answer Susan wanted to read, then <br/>
she came to the wrong place.   But I think she knew that, and it was clear in <br/>
her first post that she didn&#39;t really intend to take our advice to heart, but <br/>
to continue with Rod and Staff and her teaching methods.   <br/>
<br/>
This is clearly, overtly, plainly not a Rod and Staff kind of list.   Rod and <br/>
Staff is about control (the concept of the name of the curriculum, apart from <br/>
any other details, some of which can be discovered here):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.anabaptists.org/tracts.html#rastracts">http://www.anabaptists.org/tracts.html#rastracts</a><br/>
You can do   your own google search.   There is no official site, but this <br/>
curriculum is by the people who have little free tracts you can pick up at some <br/>
homeschooling conferences (certainly not the Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
conference) that would just break your heart with their recommendations about the <br/>
treatment of children.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean that the family in question uses those methods.   They <br/>
might not!   (I hope not.)<br/>
But this list is very clearly described at yahoogroups, and those who post <br/>
before two weeks are taking their own chances AND disrupting the list.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, in this case even if the questioner decides she learned <br/>
nothing, others on the list who were unclear about whether they might calmly wait <br/>
through a child&#39;s &quot;late reading&quot; have probably been encouraged and enlightened, <br/>
and those who were still at the point of figuring out what they believed have <br/>
been able to see their ideas in light of those others that came by.<br/>
<br/>
Every unschooler has to figure out each aspect on her own.   Without <br/>
understanding it and really choosing to practice it, that aspect will be cloudy and <br/>
vague.    We can&#39;t sell the instructions, as Rod and Staff does.    <br/>
<br/>
Control won&#39;t work, with reading.   Reading cannot be controlled.<br/>
<br/>
From a page on Disciplining Children at a site explaining Rod and Staff&#39;s <br/>
philosophy, right after the spanking paragraph (the five methods are Teaching, <br/>
Example, Praise, Warning and Spanking), there is discussion of, when the kids <br/>
get older, move toward withholding privileges instead of spanking.   Get this <br/>
example:   <br/>
-=-<br/>
Withholding privileges is more adult-like treatment. If one disobeys a proper <br/>
diet, the doctor will likely withhold pastries and sweets.-=-<br/>
<br/>
These are people living with a set of life rules in which the idea that one&#39;s <br/>
doctor &quot;withholds pastries&quot; as an adult treatment.     <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.anabaptists.org/bh/258.html">http://www.anabaptists.org/bh/258.html</a><br/>
<br/>
How far can or should unschoolers go to meet that in the middle?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not trying to sell unschooling here. We&#39;re giving it away. We&#39;re <br/>
helping people build it new in their own minds, to help make it work in their own <br/>
homes. Those who don&#39;t want it don&#39;t need to stand and complain about it.   They <br/>
can go somewhere else where someone IS selling something, and buy that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543516998">Angela, thank you for that clarification. However, where I come from,<br/>
&quot;discussion&quot; still involves respectful listening and thoughtful,<br/>
respectful response, not unkind attacks. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It can be painful to have our subconscious agendas pointed out to us, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; growth comes from self reflection.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure that any one of us is qualified, based on one or two<br/>
postings, to unearth the &quot;subconscious agendas&quot; in another person<br/>
(unless you are a trained psychologist?) I would rather assume that<br/>
each parent has a sincere desire to help their child in the best way<br/>
they know how, and to tactfully, suuportively offer alternatives,<br/>
giving examples of how these have worked out well. Based on the<br/>
negative feedback she has received here, Susan is not only leaving<br/>
this website turned off on unschoolers, but also battered in spirit. <br/>
 I will now &quot;cease and desist&quot; and turn elsewhere for mutually<br/>
respectful, supportive conversation. Best to you!<br/>

Well, that is true if you consider wanting to learn something from<br/>
those you don&#39;t necessarily agree with an agenda.<br/>

The reason why I said I was an unschooler is because I wanted to be<br/>

an unschooler, just that I am not one.<br/>

about me. The only thing that is about me is that I do not want to see<br/>
my son suffer in any way and I am afraid he will suffer if he does not<br/>
learn how to read. So in that way it is about me. And if not wanting<br/>
my child to suffer is a crime than shoot me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many here have jumped to the conclusion that he feels dumb and<br/>
his self-esteem has already suffered. From what I can tell, that is<br/>
not the case. He does not think he is dumb. He does not think his<br/>
sister is smarter than he is. He has at times expressed frustration<br/>
over his inability to read. It has not, so far, caused any emotional<br/>
damage.<br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
Reading lessons for an unwilling or unhappy kid are an especial hot <br/>

<br/>
Most of us here believe that pushing reading lessons (and other kinds of <br/>
lessons) on a kid who is either unready or unwilling (or both) can do <br/>
two kinds of harm.  It will very likely *harm the child&#39;s belief in his <br/>

         &quot;What do you do with a child who doesn&#39;t want to learn?&quot;<br/>

Native speakers of English could deduce that from the title of the post and <br/>
the text of the post.<br/>

the record, that was a fictional example, and my husband is not in any way a <br/>
liar nor a scumbag.   But if I said it without a disclaimer, it would be <br/>
reasonable for people to assume that I had chosen those words myself for some <br/>
reason, and had posted it in public knowingly and purposefully.   It wouldn&#39;t take a <br/>
psychologist, a detective or a psychic to make reasonable inferences.]<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would rather assume that<br/>
each parent has a sincere desire to help their child in the best way<br/>

Yeah, but an even MORE important assumption is that the person knowingly came <br/>

the person knew enough about the list to know what to expect, and that the <br/>
person wanted the input of people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
You, Tamara, may offer your own advice.   But you may not criticize the input <br/>
of the others or the tone of the list without violating the guidelines which <br/>
you should have received by e-mail when you joined, that are in a file at the <br/>

out ways for you to avoid the outside &quot;suffering&quot; (help him with his <br/>

It&#39;s not a jump.   You told us yourself.   He&#39;s ruining homeschooling at our <br/>
house.   You consider him to be a child who doesn&#39;t want to learn.    He WILL <br/>
be picking up on those things.   His emotional damage is his, and you don&#39;t <br/>
get to declare that there is none and have it be binding on him.<br/>
<br/>
There is not a person here, I think, who hasn&#39;t dealt with the emotional <br/>
damage of a child (either herself, her own child, a friend&#39;s child, a relative).   <br/>
 We spend our time here and many elsewhere in person as well helping cut down <br/>
on the emotional damage caused by harsh parental and scholastic practices.   <br/>
We help, freely and voluntarily, to provide other parents with ideas for how <br/>
to make their children&#39;s lives more peaceful and respectful and joyful.   <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want ideas like that, then I guess you&#39;ve taken from this list <br/>
all you need.<br/>

Most of us here believe that pushing reading lessons (and other kinds of <br/>
lessons) on a kid who is either unready or unwilling (or both) can do <br/>
two kinds of harm.  It will very likely *harm the child&#39;s belief in his <br/>
own competence* and it is also likely to *harm the quality of the <br/>
relationship between mother and child* if significant chunks of time <br/>
together are spent in unrewarding work and unpleasant conflict.<br/>
