<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844704961">I want to thank all of you who replied to me about my son.  We are <br/>
making small steps I am grateful to say.  Dh&#39;s deployment got <br/>
postponed for a few days and so we are trying to spend as much time <br/>
with him as possible.  So needless to say, there were many of you <br/>
emailed me off list and I wanted to thank all of you, but have been <br/>
focused on dh&#39;s departure and getting things of life in order to <br/>
handle it all by myself again for awhile.  I am sorry that I haven&#39;t <br/>
had time to reply, but as soon as dh leaves I will try to respond to <br/>
those emails.  They were full of sympathy and wonderful advice.  I <br/>
greatly appreciate all of you on this list who take the time to think <br/>
about our posts and try to give us good suggestions and insight. I <br/>
just reread this and it sounded kind of redundant, but I guess I am <br/>
just tired tonight:) <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to you all,<br/>
<br/>
Dana</div>
