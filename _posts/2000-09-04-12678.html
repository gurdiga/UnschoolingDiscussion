Thank you,  Melissa. Homeschoolers are not all white middle-class<br/>
suburbanites. We are all colors of the rainbow, from every  socio-economic<br/>
strata, from all over the country and throughout the world. We are college<br/>
educated, high-school graduates, doctors of philosophy, beauty school<br/>
graduates, farmers, and mechanics (among others). We are male and female. We<br/>
are married and single. We are employed outside our homes...or not. We are<br/>
every religion and belief system imaginable. But the one thing that we have<br/>
in common is a loving concern for our children that was strong enough for us<br/>
to decide to take their educational future into our hands. Most of us did<br/>
not remove our children from public school as much to get them &quot;away&quot; from<br/>
things, as to move them toward things....things like acceptance for people<br/>
as they are, not for what they have...things like exploring the world and<br/>
gathering the knowledge therein for the joy of it, not for a letter<br/>
grade...things like getting to truly know themselves as valuable people,<br/>
even if they are not &quot;team players&quot;....things like having a mind open to new<br/>
ideas and new people,no matter where they live, or what accent they have, or<br/>
how they earn their living, or where they or their ancestors were born. At<br/>
least these are some of the things that we hope our children will gain from<br/>
our decision to homeschool them. Otherwise, what&#39;s it all for? So the<br/>
implication that &quot;some&quot; people haven&#39;t the motivation or ability or caring<br/>
to homeschool disturbed me deeply.<br/>
<br/>
We can do better than this, folks.<br/>
<br/>
We MUST do better than this.<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Spanking<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been on this group for a while and have just read everyone&#39;s post<br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; am appalled at what I have been reading.  I joined to get ideas and help<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; unschooling my child.  Some of the name calling I have read is childish.<br/>
I know<br/>
&gt; that everyone has different opinions on spanking and abuse.  It is a very<br/>
&gt; difficult subject for everyone to discuss, but come on.  As far as someone<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; is a &quot;hick&quot; and someone can&#39;t believe they actually homeschool.  As far as<br/>
I am<br/>
&gt; concerned, the Lord has directed me  to homeschool.  You have to be an<br/>
&gt; intelligent, loving parent to want to stay home with your child and be in<br/>
charge<br/>
&gt; of their future as far as working at McDonald&#39;s or as an attorney.  To do<br/>
such<br/>
&gt; an important and amazing thing, you are by far, not a &quot;hick&quot;.  To even<br/>
decide to<br/>
&gt; do this, you are in a way, above others who don&#39;t.  All of us on here care<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; our children.  I am not saying we are better than anyone else.  We just<br/>
love our<br/>
&gt; children.  Therefore, this list should be a loving helpful group of<br/>
friends who<br/>
&gt; talk about how there day is going and an occasional debate is fine, but<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; name calling is for the public school system.  We should all be there for<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; other and help with the day to day problems of homeschooling.  How would<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; look to your kids if they got on here and read the name calling?  Would<br/>
you not<br/>
&gt; set such a sorry example for them?  Just speaking my opinion.  Tired of<br/>
the junk<br/>
&gt; I am reading.  Melissa<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;One time I was hysterical because my<br/>
&gt; &gt; finger was profusely bleeding. I wouldn&#39;t stop screaming and flinging<br/>
blood<br/>
&gt; &gt; all over the bathroom. She spanked me sharply and I immediately calmed<br/>
down.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was glad she did it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the problem with having such strong emotions is?????  Also the<br/>
problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; with having blood in the bathroom is???? So what, there&#39;s blood in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bathroom... Ah, just like another mother I know, maybe your mother<br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to have to clean it up and all her control issues came to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; surface...<br/>
&gt; &gt; Very classic Psychology 101,<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, no, no.....you&#39;re not getting it. I was hysterical. I needed to hold<br/>
&gt; &gt; still so she could stop the bleeding. I couldn&#39;t even hear her saying<br/>
&quot;Stop!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hold still!&quot; over my own frightened screaming. (I cut myself trying to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; &gt; lunch.) She gave me one simple stinging swat on the tush and it brought<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to earth. She didn&#39;t care about cleaning up the mess. She knew she<br/>
&gt; &gt; needed to stop the bleeding. And she was certainly used to my strong<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotions. If she had had a problem with that, I would have received a<br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; more than 3 spankings in my entire life. Not a control issue at all,<br/>
unless<br/>
&gt; &gt; you count first-aid as a control issue. The spanking was a simple<br/>
attention<br/>
&gt; &gt; getter. No ill effects and no therapy needed.<br/>
