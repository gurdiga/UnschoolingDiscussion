&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I find Ned&#39;s posting to be interesting, thought<br/>
&gt; provoking and very much related to the essence of<br/>
&gt; unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Helen, removing Ned from the list will be very<br/>
&gt; undemocratic, unfair and anti unschooling. Why anti<br/>
&gt; unschooling?  Because one of the reasons people choose<br/>
&gt; to unschool is the belief that there is no<br/>
&gt; prescription for learning, life or ideas and each one<br/>
&gt; of us as an individual and as a community, create it<br/>
&gt; as we go along with an open mind and tolerance to<br/>
&gt; others way of being. Removing Ned from the list is<br/>
&gt; putting the unschooling ideas into a circle and<br/>
&gt; punishing those, whom some of the list members think,<br/>
&gt; are crossing the line. Such an action is assuming that<br/>
&gt; there are external prescriptions for unschooling. If<br/>
&gt; we keep an attitude of plentiful we can be a better<br/>
&gt; force for change.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree........ I want Ned to stay..... His thoughts.... Well...you should be <br/>
able to agree or disagree. I wonder about the control issue.....<br/>
Our we going to be like the gov&#39;t and try and control peoples thoughts, <br/>
freedoms, speech, wants, needs, etc.?<br/>
We may not all agree with Ned, but I am glad that he is here and I have <br/>
enjoyed reading his points of view on things either way.<br/>
Anyhow, Ned, if you are going to start your own  message group, please <br/>
remember me and sign me up. My hubby has enjoyed you too even though he has <br/>
not read you things personally....Only from what I have told him about. I <br/>
have read to him some of your responses.Message: 9<br/>

&lt;&lt; but this particular dynamic bothers me - what the <br/>
new people must be thinking about all of this.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
2. Let Ned say what he has to say without the ongoing crisis over it. <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you  decide, I just wanted you to know I think people (even newbies, <br/>
<br/>
speaking only for myself) can figure out for themselves how to take the posts <br/>
<br/>
and choose to read or delete them, or even be insulted by them.  I do not <br/>
mind choosing <br/>
<br/>
I agree with that too.... I do not mind choosing as well.....<br/>
but Helen it&#39;s your choice.....I am also glad that I am not in the position <br/>
to decide as well......<br/>
