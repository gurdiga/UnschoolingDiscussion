<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160770608">&quot; Any thoughts on this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quit trying to be so controlling.<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
Your personal agenda seems more important at this point than your <br/>
relationship with the Grandparents, and your children&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER get rid of something in our house behind anyone elses back. <br/>
My children decide for themselves what to keep or not. If it gets <br/>
crowded, they have the choice of being in a more cluttered room, or <br/>
storing some things under the house or getting rid of it. I help <br/>
them find ways to organize things also.<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t get rid of something just because *I* thought it <br/>
was &quot;junk&quot;.<br/>
You really need to let go of some of your personal agenda in these <br/>
issues and try to focus on what makes your child happy. Regardless <br/>
of whether you think the toy is worthy.<br/>
