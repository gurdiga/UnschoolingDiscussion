 I never read any Holt or unschooling type material when I was in school.<br/>
 What I learned primarily was how to write a lesson plan,  a unit, how to<br/>
manage a classroom, and where to find activities for the kids.  The ONLY<br/>
philosophy of education I ever learned was Whole Language, which dealt<br/>
with how children actually learn to read.  I am so grateful for that<br/>
experience now, actually, because it is  the only thing I have ever used<br/>
for my kids   (and which also, by the way, has been virtually banned in<br/>
every public school since it did not supposedly teach &#39;the basics&quot;, and<br/>
allowed for children to read when they were  ready-too much time in the<br/>
schools&#39; view , and not measurable enough by their standards).        Amy<br/>
