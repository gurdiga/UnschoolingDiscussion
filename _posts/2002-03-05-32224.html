<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296735689">Hi all!  I have just found this group and wanted to introduce myself.  I am a <br/>
sahm to 2 ds and wife to my best friend.  We have been hsing for 6 years.  My <br/>
boys are 8yo and 11yo.  We have always followed a very loose Charlotte Mason <br/>
approach...lots of reading and free time and no workbooks.  The older my guys <br/>
get the more interested I become in true unschooling.  I have just bought the <br/>
Mary Griffith book and am soaking it all up.  I lean more towards a relaxed <br/>
approach than anything else.  I have long ago learned that curriculums just <br/>
don&#39;t work for us.  They seem too contrived and artificial.  Although, I am <br/>
quick to say that curriculums do work for others and I do respect that. <br/>
Looking forward to learning from you all.  Blessings -- MK<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976291501">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Deanna, and I live in Southern California (Yucaipa).  I am <br/>
married and have a 3 year old daughter and a 5 year old son.  We have <br/>
just started our journey into unschooling.   On the one hand I find <br/>
it very exhilerating - on the other hand I panic LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
I have just ordered the books _Teach Your Own_ by John Holt and _The <br/>
Unschooling Handbook_ by Mary Griffith.  I know Unschooling is going <br/>
to work wonderfully in our home.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m looking into the legal issues.  I&#39;ve printed up the <br/>
page from the Unschooling.com website and am in the process of <br/>
deciphering it.  It looks like homeschooling in California is pretty <br/>
easy.   <br/>
<br/>
I would also love to meet any unschoolers in the Inland Empire Area <br/>
of Southern California.  My 5 year old actually keeps asking me to go <br/>
to school.  I know that is because he wants to meet other children.  <br/>
I have started a local homeschooling group but so far we are quite <br/>
tiny :::grin::: <br/>
<br/>
Bright Blessings,<br/>
Deanna</div>

Definitely look at HSC&#39;s website.  They have all kinds of reassuring <br/>
California information!   And there are not-back-to-school outings planned in <br/>
several areas at which you could meet more families!<br/>

  Thanks, Sandra, for letting us know about this thread.  With all the email support available to me, I often forget about unschooling.info.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Our 3 yod, Loryn, has a diagnosis of autism, and I&#39;ve been struggling with family members (not my dh, though), who feel I should pursue S/L therapy through the school system.  Loryn doesn&#39;t speak at all, really.  There is some repetition from videos (Baby Einstein) and tv there, but only rare &quot;authentic&quot; speech from her, and usually just 1-2 words at a time.<br/>
   <br/>
  The thing is:  various family members (well, Mom, really, but also step-brother, in-laws, Granny, etc.) have almost convinced me to try a special ed Pre-K program (through our PS system, of course).  They&#39;ve started to see Loryn as &quot;flawed&quot;, and that she needs to be &quot;fixed&quot; (not the words they&#39;re using, obviously, but what *I&#39;m* hearing, internally). <br/>
   <br/>
  We&#39;ve only been radically unschooling for the past year or so (so still &quot;newbies&quot;, IMO), but I have embraced the unschooling philosophy with every fiber of my being, and to remarkable results within our family.  My concern is that, in disregarding ANYthing that looks like &quot;school&quot;, could I be closing doors to people/places/things that may be of help to Loryn?  And exactly WHO determines when and why a child should speak, when Loryn communicates using her own ways (some signing, mostly chirps, babbling, smiles, tugging a hand to pull someone to something she wants, etc.).  She LOVES to count, and amazes us with her drawing, counting out loud, etc., so I know she picks up on all kinds of things just by being around us, she just doesn&#39;t feel the need to communicate in &quot;typical&quot; ways.  <br/>
   <br/>
  To shed a little more light, Loryn&#39;s older sister Ashlyn has high-functioning autism.  She had some speech delay, but not to the same extent as Loryn, and went to this same special ed Pre-K program that I&#39;m thinking about for Lolo.  My feeling about Ashlyn&#39;s (almost) year in the program is that it didn&#39;t do much to help her, but it didn&#39;t delay her in anyway either.  It seems that she was the &quot;model&quot; for others in the class, which didn&#39;t benefit her (or the other students, IMO) much.  The teacher who oversees the program is a really good teacher, who &quot;gets&quot; her kids, so I trust that Loryn would be in a &quot;safe&quot; place, as long as Gayle was still head teacher of the class. <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;d love to get some feedback from you all.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll just go back to a little *light* reading! LOL<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks, and happy New Year!<br/>
