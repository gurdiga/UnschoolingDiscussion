<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983303944">It occurred to me the other day under the influence of my puzzling  <br/>
intermittent penchant for celebrating arbitrary anniversaries (and  <br/>
probably a good case of impending empty next syndrome) that next year  <br/>
will be the tenth anniversary of the publication of The Homeschooling  <br/>
Handbook. I am toying with the idea of working up something (whether  <br/>
an article or articles or an actual book is something I&#39;m still  <br/>
pondering) and would like to get in touch with everybody who  <br/>
contributed to the book.<br/>
<br/>
If you completed a questionnaire for me way back when, I&#39;d appreciate  <br/>
hearing from you. I&#39;d love to hear what your lives are like these  <br/>
days: Did you homeschool your kids forever or just for a few years?  <br/>
How did everything turn out? Are you still involved with  <br/>
homeschooling somehow even if your kids have moved on? I&#39;d even like  <br/>
to hear from your kids and how they feel about how their lives have  <br/>
worked out.<br/>
