<div id="ygrps-yiv-757799755">I&#39;ve recently stopped giving my son mini quizzes, such as asking him things <br/>
just to see if he &#39;got it&#39;. On a trip to the zoo with his gma and gpa, they <br/>
were quizzing him. Which animal has the long neck, or trunk, etc. I&#39;m sitting <br/>
uncomfortably, not knowing quite how to intervene, but my son did great. They <br/>
asked him a couple of questions about animals, then he quizzed them! Asked <br/>
them which animal had the hump, then when they answered he said, &#39;Good!&#39; It <br/>
was a laugh for everyone and an eye opener too!<br/>
