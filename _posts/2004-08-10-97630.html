<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938403161">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a new member. My name is Avery and I am a single unschooling <br/>
mother of one 10 year old boy named Gaelan. We have always unschooled <br/>
and though I am always amazed at my son&#39;s progress, I still fall prey <br/>
to the evil doubts that roam my thoughts now and then, and so here I <br/>
am. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Gaelan can read, and fairly well. His spelling and math I worry <br/>
about. Yes, in my heart of hearts, I go back to my radical unschooler <br/>
mode and leave things be to trust in his process. This is so hard <br/>
sometimes. He can add and subtract, but has a hard time dealing with <br/>
money at times. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love feedback on these issues. I feel in my heart he will pick <br/>
these things up as time goes on, but feel insecure! Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and nice meeting you all,<br/>
Avery</div>

<br/>
My kids have learned to spell from writing instant messages and e-mail and <br/>
playing online role-playing games.  Marty is the worst speller, which doesn&#39;t <br/>
surprise me as he has the whole set of &quot;indicators&quot; his dad has (also a bad <br/>
speller, who has continued to get better over the years, and he&#39;s 48 now):  math <br/>
talent, left-handed, read late, spells oddly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think in school they might have said &quot;dyslexic,&quot; but he didn&#39;t go, so <br/>
nobody said it.<br/>
<br/>
But Marty can use a spell checker pretty well!  And because I saw Keith start <br/>
to care more about spelling after he was already 21, and to continue to <br/>
improve as an adult, I&#39;m not worried about Marty.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588853824">Thank you so much!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny you mention left-handedness...that&#39;s my boy! <br/>
<br/>
Man, we can do a number on ourselves. I wrestle sometimes, though silently, and <br/>
allow my son to progress naturally and unaided by my controlling b.s. and then an <br/>
event that feels like a miracle will happen like I overhear my mother (unsupportive) <br/>
asking Gaelan what an adjective is, blah...blah... and he aswers correctly! HA!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Avery<br/>
