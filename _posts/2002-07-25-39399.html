<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem we are having is our youngest, who sees her friends (all ages) <br/>
&gt; getting ready to go back to school and going for the first time.  She wants <br/>
&gt; to be just like them, she loves to sit at the table with assignments and <br/>
&gt; wants to be a part of the lunch box<br/>
&gt; carrying crowd.  I&#39;ve tried to handle some of this by supplying her with <br/>
&gt; &quot;school type&quot; books (she loves them and does them with no prompting from me <br/>
&gt; although she really wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time for...&quot;) and when <br/>
&gt; school starts again in this area I want<br/>
&gt; to do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her <br/>
&gt; friends not being around much anymore. (Even the ones who homeschool are <br/>
&gt; &quot;going back to school.&quot;)  Maybe a trip to the dinosaur exhibit at the <br/>
&gt; Natural History Museum?<br/>
&gt; Anyway the point of this is to ask:  What do you do when the whole family <br/>
&gt; is unschooling and one doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

sister, but I really hated Real School. But playing school was fun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see any conflict with your playing school with your daughter. Get her <br/>
a lunchbox with her favorite characters on it and put her lunch in it. (Make <br/>
sure there&#39;s a thermos!)  Buy new crayons and pencils and a notebook. Give <br/>
her assignments. The trick is: SAY you&#39;re &quot;playing school.&quot; Invite HER to be <br/>
the teacher sometimes. Stress that the fun part of Playing School is you can <br/>
do the fun things about school without the boring things...and you can stop <br/>
to go on a &quot;field trip&quot; or bake cookies or read a story... whenever you want <br/>
to!<br/>
<br/>
Ask her if she really wants to try school, or if she thinks Playing School <br/>
would be okay. <br/>
