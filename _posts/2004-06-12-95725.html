<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227060203">Well, summer is in full swing and my kids are just GONE!<br/>
<br/>
My son is hanging with his buddy and they are still investigating trains, photograhy, etc etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are off with their friends too.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest comes in and out with her friends, but the oldest two seem gone all day.<br/>
<br/>
I miss having them  hang around.  And I wonder sometimes what life will be like when they are grown and gone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking this is one step toward leaving home when they are older.   <br/>
<br/>
I know when winter rolls around and the kids are back in school, they&#39;ll be snuggling up with me again.  My oldest daughter is planning to go back to school the year after next though.  She wants to go to high school the year after that, so she wants to use 8th grade to &quot;see what its like&quot; and get an idea of what the schedule is like.  I think she should go.  I think she would really like it and she would thrive there.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe how fast they are *all* growing up.  It seemed like it took so long for my son to get to 15.  And I see him as an *almost* grown man already.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe my daughter is already embarking on that journey.  And I only have one left and that won&#39;t be for very long.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to have had the privelage of raising my kids.  Nothing is more important to me.   But the whole thing makes me feel kind of betrayed.  When I first had kids, I thought I could go back when they were grown, and just pick up my life where I&#39;d left off.  But not only will the kids be gone, but my &quot;old life&quot; isn&#39;t there anymore either.<br/>
<br/>
I know that is why we all need our own interests throughout all those years, and I do.  Sometimes I just feel like I&#39;m on the outside looking in, and the years are just flying by.<br/>

need you and as much as they have always been their own people and how much <br/>
more they will be those people, they will always be yours.  And just think how <br/>
precious life has been because you homeschooled/unschooled.  I would hate to <br/>
look back and see all that time they spent locked up in schools for 13 or so <br/>
years and off they&#39;d go and I&#39;d suddenly realize that I barely knew those people <br/>
who lived with me.  You will have shared so much more.  Mine are only 6 and 2, <br/>
I can only hope I am as fortunate to stay home and share the world with them.<br/>
