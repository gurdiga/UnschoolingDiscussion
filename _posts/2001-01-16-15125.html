<div id="ygrps-yiv-188713292">Oh! How I agree.  I have posted about this issue before.  I too wish <br/>
some one would write a book about the average unschooler. One, just <br/>
like you described, who is not at all motivated to write a book or <br/>
become a famous scientist!!!!<br/>

<br>
<br>Thank you to both of you. &nbsp;My son falls somewhere inbetween. &nbsp;Some days, like 
<br>today we are memorizing the periodic table, because it is fun. &nbsp;(totally, 
<br>absolutely his idea) &nbsp;Then other days, it is video games, board games etc. &nbsp;I 
<br>have just begun to homeschool in November and have only been unschooling 2 
<br>weeks.
<br>
<br>So it really feels good to hear about other kids and parents going thru the 
<br>same. &nbsp;Thank you both. &nbsp;AND thanks to everyone on this loop. &nbsp;I have belonged 
<br>to a different loop for two months and this one two weeks - an this one is so 
<br>supportive and full of wonderful thoughts about kids, parenting and life - I 
<br>cant do without it! &nbsp;
<br>
