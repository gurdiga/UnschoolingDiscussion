I have a cousin in Arlington and there are actually people calling out to <br/>
others who are in the open to take cover. It&#39;s really sad. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
that kind of fear. It seems to me even worse than agter 9/11. I mean you <br/>
just know someone in that area will be a victim again. Take care and comfort <br/>
those poor kids.<br/>
