<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203996605">Well,<br/>
<br/>
In the paper the other day was an article on selective mutism. ie kids don&#39;t talk in certain situations, mainly school.  Of course there were all sort of behaviour modification techniques, rewarding responses, and in extreme cases pills. <br/>
<br/>
Esther is like this: she won&#39;t talk under certain conditions.  So I read. Then I got to the point where most children outgrow it by the time they are 16 or 18 or so.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, we aren&#39;t in school, and afaic, she can not talk to anyone she wants to...<br/>
<br/>
Problem solved.<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
be well,<br/>

  &lt;&lt;  Well my oldest, when she was 11 and 12, showed 8 of the 9. <br/>
  Is this disorder real or just a kid who needs to find another way to handle <br/>
  himself and parents who need to do that too.<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think it might be an allergy to our culture the same way most &quot;ADHD&quot; is an <br/>
  allergy to the school system.<br/>
<br/>
  How many of those kids&#39; symptoms could have been redirected by loving <br/>
  compassion?<br/>
<br/>
  Hard to say in a culture which presses control and obedience and stupidity.<br/>
