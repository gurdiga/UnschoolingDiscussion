 </span></blockquote>Term/Semester Grades do much the same thing, and can be assigned very<br/>
arbitrarily.  Grades can be affected dramatically if a teacher grades &quot;on a<br/>
curve&quot;, gives extra credit that is slanted towards things that the teacher<br/>
most likes/enjoys, grades for quantity rather than quality, does not take<br/>
effort or originality into account, is unaware of things happening at home<br/>
which may affect a student&#39;s grade, any many other factors too.  <br/>
<br/>
This often happens in IS settings, and the child ends up feeling they have<br/>
been cheated and treated unfairly, while paradoxically also having their<br/>
self esteem negatively impacted.  Even Good grades can have a devestating<br/>
effect on a child.  I have a niece who is a straight A+ student from day<br/>
one of her schooling.  However, her self esteem is SO centered on getting<br/>
A&#39;s (as is everyone else around her) that she is devestated by even an A-,<br/>
will spend all summer studying a subject to bring her grade up, and had a<br/>
bleeding ulcer by age 10.  Teachers refer to her as &quot;My A student&quot; or &quot;My<br/>
good student,&quot; kids turn to her for peer tutoring and her parents pressure<br/>
her to continue to perform well.  She feels that she has to live up to<br/>
everyone&#39;s expectations, including her own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy I understand this one - in 5th grade (for me) I had a teacher that was<br/>
bent on showing me that anything other than an &quot;A&quot; would not kill me.  She<br/>
gave me &quot;C&#39;s&quot; on my report card and when my Mom went to see her to see what<br/>
had happened in 6 weeks she told my Mom why she had lowered my grades.  The<br/>
result was by the end semester I didn&#39;t do any of the work and she gave me<br/>
&quot;A&#39;s&quot; in areas I had earned &quot;F&#39;s&quot; at best!  I was very confused that year.<br/>
Yuck!  Actually, I think the teacher was more than just a little confused.<br/>
