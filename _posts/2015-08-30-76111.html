<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477820144"><p dir="ltr">Over the past few months I&#39;ve become concerned that my 5 1/2 yo&#39;s highly selective eating is a problem for him.

<p dir="ltr">I am working with a classical homeopath on his behalf and he started a new remedy a few days ago which may be helping, in which case this question is moot.

Sad and distressed about what?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I tried the suggestions I received on the unschooling facebook group but he got angry with me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My unschooling facebook group?  Radical Unschooling Info?  Or another one?<br/>
<br/>
What did you do that would make him angry?  I can&#39;t imagine any advice experienced unschoolers would&#39;ve given that would make a child angry.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you NOT go to a therapist, but give him the food he wants without pressure, without anything to distress him or to make him angry?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193983115"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">-Sad and distressed about what?-<br>Being hungry and not being able to eat anything. That&#39;s what he says, anyway.<br><br>-My unschooling facebook group?  Radical Unschooling Info?  Or another one?-<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">Yours and Erika&#39;s. Advice from Alex, Joyce, Sylvias, Meredith, and many others who post here and elsewhere, as well as all the blogs you recommend. <br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra"><br>-What did you do that would make him angry?-<br>Monkey platters. &quot;Why did you buy this?&quot; &quot;I thought you might like it.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t buy foods you think I might like!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t put that on a plate! I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; If I do something wrong, like buy the wrong cheese or make a suggestion, he throws things and storms away and won&#39;t eat anything at all. The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here. Last year was very hard on our family - I was dangerously ill and in the hospital and he spent a lot of time with grandparents. While he had fun, I know his grandparents are fairly conventional and he may have felt bullied about food. I don&#39;t know - he has never said and neither have any of them, but they definitely perceive his eating as &quot;picky&quot; and aren&#39;t open to radical solutions (like making a second dish if the first was wrong, or supporting him to eat separately or watching youtubes, or all the many things I do to be his partner).<br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">We do these things: walking down the aisles and let him put anything in the cart, making all foods available, not pressuring him, but even things he picks out he later rejects, angrily or sadly. &quot;Save it,&quot; he&#39;ll say, or &quot;I do like it, but I just don&#39;t want it right now,&quot; but he doesn&#39;t eat it later, either. He stands at the fridge or the cupboard, or looks at the list he made of foods he says he likes, and none of them appeal. </div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">If there is something I am misunderstanding about monkey platters or the other advice offered, I hope it will become clear in this conversation because I am operating under the assumption that there is no problem except for one that I create and yet he is hungry, underweight and sad about the lack of pleasing food options.<br>
<br>
-Why don&#39;t you NOT go to a therapist, but give him the food he wants 
without pressure, without anything to distress him or to make him angry?-<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">I would prefer that, and if there is another way to do that than what I am doing, I want to know. I buy anything he asks for, I anticipate, I am respectful, I am available, I cook anything, I include him or not as he prefers, I don&#39;t call anything &quot;junk&quot; or empty calories, I don&#39;t push him to try anything. I make the few foods he eats, but if they are wrong in any way, or if I am unable to because we are out of something, he just doesn&#39;t eat. When we are anywhere besides home, it is very challenging, and if he is anyone else&#39;s care I have to pack a lot of groceries and debrief the caregiver, and <i>still</i> sometimes he won&#39;t eat anything. <br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra">I haven&#39;t controlled food in the past. His older brother eats a wide variety of foods. When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed. He received donor milk but it was extremely traumatic - there wasn&#39;t enough the first day. He was hungry and abandoned. It has always been a challenge to find foods he likes that fill him up, but it seems to have gotten harder in the past year since I was hospitalized extensively again. <br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_extra"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_quote"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1193983115gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><br><div style="margin-top:10px;"><hr style="min-height:2px;border-width:0px;color:rgb(227,227,227);background-color:rgb(227,227,227);">

This isn&#39;t about food; this is about courtesy. <br/>

I would say &quot;If I&#39;m doing the shopping, I can buy what I want to.&quot; <br/>
If someone said to me &quot;Don&#39;t put that on a plate! I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; I would take the plate away silently and not be inclined to bring another for a few days.<br/>

Helping children be polite is important.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe don&#39;t make monkey platters for him, make them for the family.  Make a little party platter and eat from it yourself, too.  Or yourself exclusively.  Maybe his food and eating are too separate from the family&#39;s (and maybe not—I&#39;m guessing for the benefit of anyone who&#39;s reading and has any similar problems.<br/>

<br/>
Do you go to buffet restaurants?<br/>
When Marty was a kid and we went to Home Buffet (sadly closed now, though Albuquerque has several buffets), he would only get white food.  Mashed potatoes and a few other white things.  He grew up fine.<br/>
But if he&#39;s in the presence of 100 choices, will he choose two or three things?  Jello? Corn?  White rice?  Cheesecake?<br/>
<br/>
-=-The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here.-=-<br/>
And so why &quot;occupational therapist&quot;?  He&#39;s not having a hard time operating a spoon or chewing.  <br/>

-=-When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed.

<p dir="ltr">The reason for OT is that, in asking around, &quot;talkies&quot; directed me to OTs. A lot of people who have been through similar-sounding food issues also suggested OTs, and antibody testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I haven&#39;t done a buffet restaurant, but sometimes we go to Whole Foods. So far nothing but pepperoni pizza has appealed. Unfortunately I bought the wrong pepperoni this time, and he doesn&#39;t like the pizza. He did eat a few pieces of plain sushi, though, so maybe the work with the homeopath is helping.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maybe there is not an unschooling-friendly solution that involves an OT.</p>

This isn&#39;t about food; this is about courtesy. <br>
<br>
I would say &quot;If I&#39;m doing the shopping, I can buy what I want to.&quot; <br>
If someone said to me &quot;Don&#39;t put that on a plate! I didn&#39;t ask for that!&quot; I would take the plate away silently and not be inclined to bring another for a few days.<br>

Helping children be polite is important.<br>
<br>
Maybe don&#39;t make monkey platters for him, make them for the family.  Make a little party platter and eat from it yourself, too.  Or yourself exclusively.  Maybe his food and eating are too separate from the family&#39;s (and maybe not—I&#39;m guessing for the benefit of anyone who&#39;s reading and has any similar problems.<br>
<br>
-=-he is hungry, underweight and sad about the lack of pleasing food options.-=-<br>
<br>
Do you go to buffet restaurants?<br>
When Marty was a kid and we went to Home Buffet (sadly closed now, though Albuquerque has several buffets), he would only get white food.  Mashed potatoes and a few other white things.  He grew up fine.<br>
But if he&#39;s in the presence of 100 choices, will he choose two or three things?  Jello? Corn?  White rice?  Cheesecake?<br>
<br>
-=-The disproportionate reactions are part of the reason I think there may be deeper issues here.-=-<br>
And so why &quot;occupational therapist&quot;?  He&#39;s not having a hard time operating a spoon or chewing.  <br>
<br>
-=-When Lysander, the 5 1/2 yo, was a baby (8months), I was suddenly hospitalized and unable to breastfeed. He received donor milk but it was extremely traumatic - there wasn&#39;t enough the first day. He was hungry and abandoned. It has always been a challenge to find foods he likes that fill him up, but it seems to have gotten harder in the past year since I was hospitalized extensively again. -=-<br>
<br>
Then psychology, not occupational therapy.<br>

If you want someone who knows about unschooling to communicate with him, or you, or both, there are some people here:<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90388590"><blockquote><span title="ireply"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">&gt;Over the past few months I&#39;ve become concerned that my 5 1/2 yo&#39;s highly selective eating is a problem for &gt;him. Recently he was eating only highly sweetened foods like candy and kettlecorn, and pepperoni pizza but &gt;only the parts with pepperoni on them. He is often hungry and seems sad and distressed.&nbsp;</span><br class="ygrps-yiv-90388590yui-cursor"><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br> </span></div></span></blockquote><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">If he only eats the parts of the pizza with pepperoni on them, can you add more pepperoni so that it&#39;s all the &quot;good part&quot;? &nbsp;What if you found recipes for other things with pepperoni on them....will he try things that he sees you eating?&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">You&#39;ve said that he seems pretty small for his age and that he&#39;s underweight. Before I jumped to fixing that, I&#39;d ask the doctor (since you said you&#39;re going anyway) if he really is underweight or if he&#39;s just little. Some kids are built that way.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">I second Sandra&#39;s recommendation for buffets. My kids have tried all kinds of things that I never would have thought to offer them. &nbsp;If something looks good, we take enough for a couple of bites and if it is good, we can go back for as much as they want. And I think all of the buffets we go to have pizza and lots of desserts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">My 10yo has been in speech therapy since he was three or four and we&#39;re on our sixth therapist (due to changing insurance, staff turnover, one therapist who didn&#39;t like my son and I any more than we liked her). I sit in on every appointment. I&#39;m the only parent there who does that, which I don&#39;t understand. I want to know what&#39;s going on. One of his therapists cheated at Chutes and Ladders, gloated when she won, and told my son no one would want to play with him if he wasn&#39;t a better sport. Not sure I would have believed that if i hadn&#39;t seen it myself. &nbsp;Things have improved since I&#39;ve insisted that they limit his therapy to exactly what he&#39;s there for. &nbsp;(From what I see in the lobby, a lot of parents are using the therapists to help with behavioral issues at home. It&#39;s the same way in my daughter&#39;s karate class.)</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">Michelle&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">PS -- I asked on the list a couple of years back about my son&#39;s difficulties in speech therapy. As his speech improved, all of the tantrums and behavior problems vanished. I really wish one of the experts had told me that explosive tantrums were typical for young children with apraxia of speech. That would have lessened my stress levels a LOT!&nbsp;</span></div></div>

<p dir="ltr">I think that&#39;s a good point. He only seems sad and distressed about food, not other things, but maybe the sadness and distress over food is a manifestation of frustration and boredom that I&#39;m not picking up on in time. I know *I* eat when I&#39;m frustrated and bored.</p>

The reason for OT is that, in asking around, &quot;talkies&quot; directed me to OTs. <br>
A lot of people who have been through similar-sounding food issues also suggested OTs, and antibody testing.-=-<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;talkies.&quot; <br>
&quot;A lot&quot; of people recommended occupational therapy for food aversions?  Seriously?<br>
<br>
-=-I haven&#39;t done a buffet restaurant, but sometimes we go to Whole Foods.-=-<br>
<br>
At a buffet restaurant, the food has smells and textures and combinations that being at Whole Foods doesn&#39;t have anything to do with.<br>
Try a buffet.  Even if he only eats one thing, YOU can eat lots of things in front of him that you don&#39;t make at home, or that he&#39;s never seen.<br>
<br>
-=-Maybe there is not an unschooling-friendly solution that involves an OT.-=-<br>
<br>
If an OT is your goal, I still wonder why.<br>
<br>
There was a discussion on Always Learning years back.  It wasn&#39;t the same question, but I know there are things in here that you could consider to your child&#39;s benefit.<br>

<br>
-=-Perhaps I&#39;ll let it rest again, even if it means Twizzlers and pizza. It&#39;s just distressing when we don&#39;t have those things.-=-<br>
<br>
Then avoid distress by ALWAYS having those things.  He won&#39;t eat the same thing for the rest of his life.  If you can&#39;t fix what you see as a problem, at least don&#39;t make it worse by inducing distress!  (and find a buffet; seriously :-) )<br>

<br/>
You&#39;re confusing issues, though.  Your evidence and reports are about things other than food.  There seem to be relationship problems, but you&#39;re not asking about that, and occupational therapy isn&#39;t about relationships (nor about food issues).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410346430">-=-I meant the Whole Foods buffet, but I&#39;ll look for a restaurant. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not the same thing, when the food isn&#39;t close-up, and smelling like it smells, and with a vast quantity, and all one price.  The Whole Foods &quot;buffet&quot; is a deli counter, isn&#39;t it?  Of very expensive by the pound prepared foods with lots of ingredients kids might not like?  And much of it cold foods?<br/>
<br/>
-=- It sounds like the key is not to run out of his favorite pepperoni pizza so I&#39;ll work on that.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There is no &quot;the key.&quot;  There is no one thing you can do and then sit back in sucess.  This is about principles you can live by more solidly (for years, for life).<br/>
<br/>
This might sound picky, but don&#39;t &quot;work on that.&quot;  DO that.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-And yes, a lot of folks in other health, nutritional and parenting groups recommend OTs, as well as friends who are talk therapists.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you want advice from radical unschoolers, don&#39;t expect us to defend or deflect &quot;health groups&quot; or &quot;nutritional groups&quot; or &quot;parenting groups.&quot;  You can&#39;t be and do everything.  It sounds like you&#39;re taking too much particular input and not enough philosophical underpinnings about WHY do do things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He *wants* to see the doctor, so I&#39;m not going to cancel the appointment, but maybe I can follow up the appointment with a trip to get the right pepperoni.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the appointment isn&#39;t within the next twelve hours, get the pepperoni he likes before you go to the doctor.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing (and could be wrong) that you have a personal habit involving methodology—things in order, lists, what *should* be, and then what should be next. <br/>
<br/>
This is not going to help you be a present, direct mom.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m wrong.  <br/>
If, in any small way, you&#39;re putting your vision of your child before your actual child, please change.  Not after the pepperoni, not after the doctor&#39;s appointment, but a little bit right this moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936341220"><font color="#3f3f3f">My son recently asked for a small fridge beside his desk where he has his computer. &nbsp;We had been at a hotel with a stocked courtesy fridge, and he loved the idea. &nbsp;He wanted one for himself. &nbsp;We set it up for him. &nbsp;Its a very small fridge (like 2 feet by 1 foot), stocked with things he&#39;s picked out for himself and some things I thought he might like. &nbsp;If he doesn&#39;t reach for the things I thought he&#39;d like, I take them out and put them in the big fridge for myself or my husband. &nbsp;In his fridge right now, there is cheese, pepperoni sticks, Pringles chips, iced tea, fizzy water, individual fruit cups, individual hummus cups, carrot sticks. &nbsp;On the top of the fridge are some pretzels for dipping hummus in, and crackers for cheese. &nbsp;This fridge of Ethan&#39;s is only about 15 feet from the main fridge and pantry, but he loves having his own place for his very own food that he can pull out and munch on whenever he wants. &nbsp;</font><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">I still offer and bring him breakfast, lunch and dinner, and will offer snacks throughout the day as well. &nbsp;Lots of options. &nbsp;No pressure. &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m having a sandwich. &nbsp;Want one?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re having salmon tonight. &nbsp;Sound good?&quot; &nbsp;I do make sure to make meals I know he likes. &nbsp;We&#39;re fortunate because Ethan does like most foods, so that makes things easier than if he had a more limited flavour palette. &nbsp;For a couple of years from the ages of five to seven or so, he did seem to prefer mostly pale foods like potatoes, pasta and breads. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">I&#39;ve notice over the last year, Ethan is eating bigger portions. &nbsp;He&#39;s twelve now, and still very lean. &nbsp;He&#39;s never been a person to eat big portions. &nbsp;He prefers to graze on and off all day. &nbsp;He says he prefers warm food at meal time, and savory food over sweet food. &nbsp;Late in the evening he likes carbs in the form of mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese. &nbsp;We have some single serving frozen options in our freezer that can be heated up quickly and easily. He recently asked me to make quiche for dinner twice a week.<br><br>We&#39;ve always talked about food--what he likes and doesn&#39;t like, what he wants and doesn&#39;t want, how much, how little, how often--in a casual, conversational way, the same way we talk about anything else he is engaged in. &nbsp;I approach food like I do any other part of our day. &nbsp;I try to find what works best, and do more of that until things change, then find something else that works, all the while throwing a little this or that in to see if it catches someone&#39;s interest. &nbsp;With food, as with many things we do, I try to keep things light and playful and about enjoying the experience as much as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Karen James</font></div></div>

Me:  -=-My unschooling facebook group? Radical Unschooling Info? Or another one?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Original poster:  -=--My unschooling facebook group? Radical Unschooling Info? Or another one?-<br/>
Yours and Erika&#39;s. Advice from Alex, Joyce, Sylvias, Meredith, and many others who post here and elsewhere, as well as all the blogs you recommend. -=-<br/>
and<br/>
-=-(I didn&#39;t post on Sandra&#39;s fb page but I read other posts). -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the ancient guidelines for posting on this list (this 14-year-old group):<br/>
<br/>
ALL posts should be<br/>
	• honest<br/>
	• proofread<br/>
	• sincere<br/>
	• clear<br/>
<br/>
A simple, clear, honest question is best.<br/>
But an advantage to a complicated question with extra details is that we can help see some of the larger problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe you wanted to say you had already done all you could glean or gather on your own without having asked the question, but what was implied was that you had asked for advice about this, and that I, Erika, Alex, Joyce, Sylvia (one or two of them), Meredith, and many others had failed to help you, so you needed to go beyond that.  But you came here to ask us about occupational therapy, instead of asking your unschooling question for the first time, clearly.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of this exchange, it seems you&#39;re rejecting ideas without taking time to try them.  Please don&#39;t.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/readalittle">http://sandradodd.com/readalittle</a><br/>
Read a little.<br/>
Try a little.<br/>
Wait a while.<br/>
Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Laricchia&#39;s introduction to unschooling might help.  I think you&#39;ve not deschooled as far or as well as you might, and I&#39;m guessing (could be wrong) that you&#39;re trying to create a fusion of ideas—radical unschooling, nutrition, &quot;talkies&quot; [the word &quot;talky&quot; is about a movie with sound, not about therapy, as far as I know as someone who&#39;s been quite interested in English (and movies, and psychology) for over half a century], and whatever parenting advice comes along.  <br/>
<br/>
IF you go through Pam&#39;s intro, you might relax about food and worries and outside measures.  There is a lot of stuff between you and your child, I think.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/">http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/</a><br/>
It will take a few weeks.  Please go to a buffet half a dozen times in there.  It&#39;s cheaper than occupational therapy, and don&#39;t involve other people.  Be directly with your family, in a smiling, non-pressured, peaceful way, as often as possible.  With practice, it can be almost continuous, day and night, for years.<br/>

It may well have been tied up with your illness initially, but now it&#39;s also tied up with you being worried, a lot of possibly unwanted attention and pressure on him to be happy, to eat. Instead of focusing on fixing the negative, I would suggest focusing on increasing the positive. Let go of the worry and the desire to fix and reach for joy and happiness. Have lots of interesting food in the house. Don&#39;t make it for him or bring it to him. Bring him only what you already know he loves and make sure there is plenty of it - every time you bring or suggest something new to him you&#39;re adding to the pressure and his sensing your fear. Instead, joyfully bring him lots of pepperoni pizza. Eat with him and connect with him so that food becomes associated with joy rather than fear. And do other joyful things with him too to build that connection. Don&#39;t talk about the food, show him you&#39;re cool with helping him eat what he loves. Make the eating a side thing, diminish the power you&#39;ve given it. As he realises his eating isn&#39;t something that has power over you or him, it will more than likely become more relaxed, more joyful. At the moment food and eating are filled with fear for him - yours and his - and making it medical and seeking treatment is all building up that fear and power further.

We are sweet and close most of the time, *except* for when he is hungry or if I am coaching him about yelling at me and throwing things (when he is hungry). *If* he is reacting to a bad feeling in his gut from eating foods that don&#39;t agree with him, we feel trapped in this dynamic. I have an acquaintance who spent his childhood in pain because he didn&#39;t know he had celiac disease.

<br/>
No, it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
You seem to think others here are suggesting that you cause HIM to relax.<br/>
YOU, the mom, are the one who needs to chill.<br/>
<br/>
Before reading anything else, re-read this post, from me, from yesterday.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/conversations/messages/76133">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/conversations/messages/76133</a><br/>
<br/>
Before posting anything else, re-read all the messages in this thread, sign up for Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro, re-read the link above AGAIN.<br/>
<br/>
I was asking you to stop looking at this particular mess, and to look at your deschooling, your own emotions, your life and beliefs.<br/>
You can&#39;t write write write write write more about this problem and solve it.  You need to stop, be still, look at the sky, breathe.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We are sweet and close most of the time, *except* for when he is hungry or if I am coaching him about yelling at me and throwing things (when he is hungry). -=-<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/coaching">http://sandradodd.com/coaching</a><br/>
If you wait until he&#39;s angry, that&#39;s arguing, not coaching.  If he&#39;s yelling and throwing things, that&#39;s fighting, not coaching.<br/>
<br/>
Your entire unschooling needs to be fortified and clarified.  Start with basics, and end with basic, and stop looking through the wrong end of the binoculars.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In my memory, my big issue from childhood was being made to go &quot;do something,&quot; especially outside or active, when I really just wanted to lie on my bed and read or listen to music all the time. I craved companionship, too, but was socially awkward and miserable in the school social dynamic.

<br/>
Your child isn&#39;t in Jr. High.  Your child isn&#39;t going to have school dynamics, if you can stop spinning your wheels where you are and move toward unschooling.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/doit">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t post.  Don&#39;t respond.  Re-read this post as often as you need to, but don&#39;t post for at least a week.  A month would be better.  Make progress.  See changes.   Be with your child in other ways, different ways.  You&#39;re in a loop.  Change things.<br/>
<br/>
Read a little (but first, this post, again, slowly and thoughtfully).<br/>
Try a little (a little—go to the page linked above and read what I mean by that, and why, and how).<br/>
Wait a while (not ten minutes, not half an hour—days).<br/>
Watch.  Don&#39;t watch to prove yourself right and me wrong and your child faulty.  Watch for goodness, and watch for peace.<br/>
<br/>
Post again when you see things changing for the better.<br/>
Post after the second or third time you go to the buffet restaurant.<br/>

husband wanted to lose weight. He is overweight, and asked for help to 
lose weight. I would make suggestions, watch documentaries and share all about them.<br class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17638"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_15079"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17641"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" dir="ltr" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_15114">The
 unintended consequence was that my 12 year old heard these 
conversations, and said &quot;you&#39;re making me afraid to eat&quot;. Thankfully, he
 was old enough and aware enough to tell me this, so I stopped having 
those conversations, stopped watching or discussing the documentaries around him. <br class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17644"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_15839" dir="ltr"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17647"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_15840" dir="ltr">It&#39;s likely your son may be sensing your worry about food, and feeling 
stressed out. Try to relax. Many kids go through food jags where they 
want nothing but peanut butter crackers, or nothing but pepperoni pizza. One of my kids ate pretty much nothing but cereal for the longest time (his choice). Then it was PB&amp;J. He eats lots of foods now, though, and is a healthy adult. <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17820" class="ygrps-yiv-1989544167" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17701" dir="ltr">When my child was yelling or hitting, I&#39;d walk away. I wouldn&#39;t say a 
lot. If anything, I&#39;d calmly say &quot;Don&#39;t hit&quot; or &quot;Stop&quot; but then turn around and leave the room if it continued.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want him to think it&#39;s ok to do that, but it&#39;s not the right time to process it. My boys never really wanted to have a big discussion after, either, just a cuddle to know I wasn&#39;t mad at them. <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_18224" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17635"><span></span></div><br>  <div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17709" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17708" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17738" dir="ltr"> <hr id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_17739" size="1">  <font id="ygrps-yiv-1989544167yui_3_16_0_1_1441073893780_18158" face="Arial" size="2"> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;Sarah Thompson thompsonisland@...
