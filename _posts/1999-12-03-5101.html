<div id="ygrps-yiv-299129611">I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews on Clonlara.  Some people think it&#39;s the <br/>
best thing they ever found.  Others feel like they charge an awful <br/>
lot (about $550 per year)  for what they do.  I think it depends on <br/>
whether you feel like you need this kind of cover.  It actually is a <br/>
school - not a legal defense association like H$LDA.  Clonlara states <br/>
that they will help you by testifying in court if you need them too,  <br/>
but they don&#39;t offer lawyers, etc.  That said,  I would much prefer <br/>
my money go to an org.  like Clonlara than H$LDA,  but I&#39;d rather not <br/>
spend the money on either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118660144">Clonlara has a yearly conference. This year it will be in Toledo, OH, June 1-3. We&#39;ve been to the conference several times. It&#39;s really cool to be someplace where the whole world homeschools!  <br/>

the sweetest and strongest proponents of unschooling ever....she is inspiring <br/>
and real and such a gift to the homeschooling community. Wish she&#39;d write a <br/>
book!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020356214">Dear Pam, I have had the pleasure of attending one of Pat&#39;s &quot;Conference <br/>
Classes&quot;, and she was so fresh and relaxing. She went on about her son and <br/>
her panic about his learning english gramatics and then got to giggling while <br/>
she  told us he became an Editor!<br/>
Well she sure could contribute a book.  Wonder if she has burnout about <br/>
contributing.<br/>
