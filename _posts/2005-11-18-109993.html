<div id="ygrps-yiv-728079687">Well, after a long break, I&#39;m returning to the list.<br/>
<br/>
How was the Live and Learn conference? (Or should I check the archives <br/>
first??).<br/>
<br/>
Is there another planned for next year?  We didn&#39;t make it this year <br/>
but would like to come next year.  My son really misses the friends he <br/>
made last year in MA.<br/>

That&#39;s not conference details, outside place and date, but photos of where it <br/>
will be, and at the bottom links to various people&#39;s photos to THIS year&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than discuss the conference in detail here, though, probably better to <br/>
check the Live and Learn list.   Thanks.<br/>
