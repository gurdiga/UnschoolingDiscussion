<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834013756"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Mac and Carol Brown &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mjcmbrwn@...">mjcmbrwn@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also think that there is a danger in discovering a child&#39;s &#39;gifts&#39; in<br/>
&gt; that everyone may then focus on those things. But in my own life, I have<br/>
&gt; found that the things I am good at (NB I am no way gifted at anything),<br/>
&gt; are not necessarily the things I am passionate about. I&#39;m sure that a<br/>
&gt; lot of my depression over the years has been because I have been pushed<br/>
&gt; towards the things that came easily, and away from the things I really<br/>
&gt; wanted to do even though they didn&#39;t come naturally or well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooh, this is SUCH an important point, especially as it related to the whole<br/>
&quot;giftedness&quot; thing. Where oh where did our culture get the idea that<br/>
something is only worth doing if it is done to some arbitrary standard of<br/>
&quot;goodness&quot;?? Why can&#39;t I just play the piano and SUCK but love it?? Or play<br/>
the piano and take 20 years to be able to play the pieces that someone else<br/>
can play in 2 and not care?? Why does it matter so much that things are done<br/>
quickly, easily, or perfectly, instead of that they are done joyfully,<br/>
passionately, and enduringly?? My college swim coach put a huge emphasis on<br/>
love of the sport, and taught me that an enduring love of swimming,<br/>
exercise, and having a healthy body were much more important than winning<br/>
some tin medal in a competition that no-one would remember once it was over.<br/>
He was so right about this, as about so many life lessons he taught me.<br/>
While many of my fellow swim team members who had been pushed to excel from<br/>
very young ages (some started on swim teams at age 4!?!) were just going<br/>
through the motions, I who had walked on to the swim team at age 20 with no<br/>
competitive experience was just feeling the blossoming of a life passion.<br/>
Most likely, very few of them continue to swim, but for me it is an ongoing<br/>
love that I make sure I practice weekly. So while I was not a &quot;successful&quot;<br/>
swimmer in that I didn&#39;t win very many medals, I have a wonderful passion<br/>
for swimming that will endure my whole life and keep my body strong and<br/>
limber, and in good health. How do we define success? As unschoolers, our<br/>
greatest gift is that we can re-define it to help our children become people<br/>
who are not hindered in their pursuit of their life&#39;s passions by someone<br/>
else&#39;s definitions of success.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I read I think it was &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot;<br/>
the parents shared alot of their stories about thier<br/>
experience as siblings to learn how to be different<br/>
with their kids. <br/>
<br/>
One woman had a sibling who was more musically gifted <br/>
while she herself love playing piano although she<br/>
struggle with it. She liked taking the time to figure<br/>
it all out. But her mother maybe thinking she was<br/>
helping maybe not discouraged her and encourage her<br/>
musically gifted child. Maybe we have a fear if a<br/>
child struggles with something that they are wasting<br/>
their time and they should find something that they do<br/>
easily. Or if they work hard on something that to our<br/>
own eyes they struggle with they are wasting their<br/>
time not finding their gifts.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think how many times as I grew older that I<br/>
didn&#39;t take up new things because I thought my<br/>
learning time for it was over because I could never be<br/>
a &#39;professional&#39; at it.<br/>
<br/>
I also didn&#39;t do a lot of things I wanted to do for<br/>
fun that if I had my life to live over again I would.<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to work in a coffee shop. I have<br/>
wanted to work in a bakery and as a naturalist in a<br/>
park. Or heck maybe I will do it. I&#39;ll just have to do<br/>
it when my kids are a little more independent. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066230987">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a few weeks ago and have really been enjoying all your<br/>
posts. I don&#39;t feel I have much to contribute at this point as we are just<br/>
starting out on this adventure (my kids are 5 and 2), but I&#39;ve found this to<br/>
be a terrifically thoughtful, stimulating, intelligent, articulate,<br/>
supportive, civilized group and really look forward to being a part of the<br/>
discussions in the years to come.<br/>
<br/>
One question for you all. I  participate in an parenting listserve<br/>
associated with my college. It&#39;s  good bunch of people. Several of them are<br/>
currently struggling with school and learning issues with their kids. As I<br/>
read of their trials I keep saying to myself, &quot;homeschooling would solve<br/>
this problem.&quot; Most of them are totally unfamiliar with homeschooling and,<br/>
in addition, were themselves all very academically driven and successful and<br/>
are, for the most part, pretty high achievers in their professional lives.<br/>
All of which means that they have certain biases, having been so successful<br/>
at school themselves, but are also open-minded, good at research and open to<br/>
new ideas, and want the best for their kids (really the best, not just the<br/>
&quot;best&quot; schools and the &quot;best&quot; jobs.)<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the question (sorry, I do tend to be long-winded): What titles<br/>
would you all recommend for someone who is just beginning to learn about<br/>
homeschooling? I have a shelf full of books on the subject, but am having a<br/>
hard time picking out the two or three that would best introduce the idea to<br/>
someone for whom it is brand new. Also, what two or three websites would you<br/>
most recommend to help open their eyes to the possibilities of<br/>
homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for your advice,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477945268"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose">Hoomeschooling for Excellence would be the first book I would reccommend. &nbsp;
<br>Three of the Colfax&#39;s sons went to Harvard on scholarship and the 4th believe 
<br>Yale.
<br>
<br>I would have considered myself academically driven (i was g/t in school, 4.0 
<br>college <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.state.nj.us/njded/genfo/overview/faq_homeschool.htm">HOMESCHOOLING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</a></font><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose"> &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.state.nj.us/njded/genfo/overview/faq_homeschool.htm">HOMESCHOOLING FREQUENTLY 
<br>ASKED QUESTIONS</a></font><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose"> &nbsp;etc), and this book really helped with all the doubters. 
<br>
<br>The Homeschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith and The Homeschooling Book of 
<br>Answers by Linda Dobson are also great resources.
<br>
<br>I am currently waiting for 3 books by John Holt that I ordered this week. &nbsp;
<br>Anything by him and everything by him I understand is a must especially once 
<br>you have committed to the ideal.
<br>
<br>Here is the site for his books &nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm">Holt GWS Web Site</a></font><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose"> 
<br>
<br>Good luck. &nbsp;You can&#39;t make your friends homeschool - but you can certainly 
<br>offer them some wonderful reading. &nbsp;Believe me, it will leave them wanting 
<br>more. &nbsp;That is what happened to me. &nbsp;I originally was considering this for my 
<br>son for next September and this pas Sept. I read the Colfax&#39;s story, then the 
<br>Book of Answers and by Septembers end I wanted to begin at the Christmas 
<br>break. &nbsp;Well, thanks to good old public school small mindedness, I stopped 
<br>sending my son by the last week of October and offically notified them 11/1.
<br>
<br>Have not regretted one minute. &nbsp;

<br>
<br>Best of luck. &nbsp;If they have an open mind, and believe there must be a better 
<br>way than what public or even private school is offering - they will be 
<br>intrigued to learn more, at a minimum.

I would recommend one on basic homeschooling, one on unschooling, and David&#39;s <br/>
And the Skylark Sings With Me, which he described as community-based <br/>
education. That way they can get a very good idea of the different ways <br/>
people can homeschool, and would have a good chance of finding something that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062185486">About a year ago, I read a book called &quot;Wishcraft&quot;.  It is about figuring<br/>
out what you would like to do and how to allow yourself the resources to<br/>
do it.  I spent my 20&#39;s doing a lot of things on a whim.  Lived in a<br/>
remote part of Alaska, stayed on Hawaii for 3 months in a tent, worked<br/>
only when I needed cash)  My parents thought I had lost it and were so<br/>

realize whatever work I do need to be outdoors and<br/>
physical. So it has lead me to one new new passion/<br/>
Nature Awareness seems more important. I just got my<br/>
Kamana II Naturalist Program from the Wilderness<br/>
Awareness School yesterday. I am so excited! <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t learning grand!<br/>
<br/>
But there is still a part of me that wants to work in<br/>
a bakery and other things. But to do that would be to<br/>
take time awoy from other interests so there is always<br/>
a balance. I think what&#39;s different about my thinking<br/>
now is I am making a concsious choice not to persue my<br/>
on a whim job learning because I want to do something<br/>
else. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892260937">I would like to make a recommendation for a good hs. book. It is not an<br/>
unschooling<br/>
book in  anyway- but many of the ideas contained are good for helping mom&#39;s<br/>
set up <br/>
an atomosphere of a learning enviornment in their home. You can take the<br/>
ideas you<br/>
might like and incorporate them. It is very inspriational has helped me see<br/>
that<br/>
our hs homes need to be complete learning places for all kinds of things.<br/>
You can<br/>
skip any structred lesson stuff and just glean what you want. It is The<br/>
Whole Hearted<br/>
Child by The Clarkson&#39;s. It is a Christian book, but still has lots of meat<br/>
for new<br/>
hschoolers.<br/>
I am just getting into the mode of thinking unschooling and would like to<br/>
say that<br/>
after 1 1/2 years of searching and reading and praying that my heart is<br/>
finally tending<br/>
to be led to a more relaxed way of thinking this hs thing. It has been a<br/>
very heavy burden<br/>
to wonder and worry if your kids are adding up to what other&#39;s are learning<br/>
at school and <br/>
as I read more and more about unschooling my heart has been eased of worry<br/>
and I am beginning<br/>
to relax. At least for this week.<br/>
