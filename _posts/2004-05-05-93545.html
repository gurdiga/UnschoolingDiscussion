<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516155652">&quot;How neat!! We don&#39;t have those around here! I&#39;ve always thought about <br/>
celebrating, but never really learned enough about it to do so-a local <br/>
celebration <br/>
would help so much... Maybe someday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why wait? Have your own Dios de los muertos celebration!! We did a mini-version at Christmas by setting out pictures on the hearth of our loved ones that had died and interspersing them with small candles. It was a lovely addition to our day, and reminded us that our loved ones are always a part of us.<br/>

Go get some cool skull molds and other supplies here:<br/>

Being an unschooler means exploring the world, not waiting for it to show up at your doorstep!:) Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
But don&#39;t do it at Christmas.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s like having a Christmas tree on the side of the grill at 4th of July.  <br/>
Some days just have to be on the day they are.   That&#39;s why days have names. <br/>
&lt;G&gt;   Nowadays the names are boring, like July 24, but in Utah that&#39;s not <br/>
boring, and at my house it&#39;s not boring, but in the Middle Ages, days had names.  <br/>
And some still do.  Boxing Day.  In the U.S. that&#39;s nothing.  In England it&#39;s <br/>
something.<br/>

Yesterday was Cinco de Mayo. Tomorrow is National Teacher Day (ugh! &lt;g&gt;). May <br/>
11 is National Eat What You Want Day. August 2 is Friendship Day, Sister Day <br/>
AND Mustard Day! August 9 is BookLover&#39;s Day, the 15 is Relaxation Day, and <br/>
the 25 is Kiss and Make Up Day.<br/>
<br/>
September 6 is Nation Do IT! Day. The 10, Sandra, is &quot;Sew&quot; Be It Day. The 22 <br/>
is Elephant Appreciation Day. <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites is January 23 (Cameron&#39;s birthday) which is National Pie <br/>
Day!<br/>
<br/>
So we DO have &quot;days&quot; here----you just have to dig a bit!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454258214">Day of the Dead is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Our church (UU) did a big party for the kids.  They brought things that<br/>
reminded them of someone who had passed or perhaps a pet that died.  We<br/>
played games, ate and the pre-teen kids did a haunted house.  We had a ball.<br/>

<br/>
Same here.   Too much sun, too many margarita&#39;s and too much trampoline. <br/>
I think I&#39;ve permanently damaged my spine.   But the food was good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget &quot;No Socks Day&quot; on the eighth! &lt;g&gt;  Socks?  What are those? <br/>
&quot;National Do Dah Day&quot; on the 19th and &quot;National Grape Popsicle Day&quot; on<br/>
the 27th.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s birthday is the thirteenth and it&#39;s also National Kite Day. <br/>
We&#39;ve been collecting kites for a few months and we&#39;ve invited people out<br/>
to fly kites that day.   If the weather doesn&#39;t cooperate we&#39;ll hang the<br/>
kites from the ceiling, turn on the fan and use our imagination.&lt;g&gt;   <br/>

<br/>
See, I think that&#39;d be really cool, if a family was doing it because it was somehow meaningful to them.:)<br/>
I&#39;m all about NOT following tradition unless it&#39;s meaningful on a personal level....which is why we like to borrow from other traditions that have something we can use and enjoy.<br/>
Like the part of Day of the Dead that was about honoring your loved ones that died. I can see doing that at other times of the year too, but we really liked having that at Christmas.<br/>
I can&#39;t see having sugar skulls and the whole shebang though.:) That would seem silly. But hey, ya never know!<br/>

The way you wrote it the first time, I thought you had had sugar skulls.  I <br/>
think it was in the same post (maybe same paragraph) with a link for buying <br/>
stuff (I THOUGHT, but I  could&#39;ve been reading lightning fast and thinking <br/>
thunder slow).<br/>
