&gt;I also have a suggestion for when you start saying no - you are not required<br/>
&gt;to give her a reason, even if she asks for one. After all, she is not one of<br/>
&gt;your children. Just repeat the no, or else she will start to break down<br/>
&gt;whatever reasons you give her, or waste a lot of time and create bad energy<br/>
&gt;in you by trying to do so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I took some sales training at one time, and we were told how to disagree <br/>
with whatever reasons the person gave for saying no. The only thing that <br/>
was to stop us from trying to sell to a person was if they just said no <br/>
with no reason given. I&#39;ve taken that information and use it now to get <br/>
salespeople off my back. Works with pushy neighbours too.<br/>
