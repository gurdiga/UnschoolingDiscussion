<div id="ygrps-yiv-245192105">I do think kids that have been in school will have many questions if the<br/>
family is lucky enough to leap into unschooling.  At first, my kids were<br/>
worried because they &quot;didn&#39;t do anything all day.&quot;  Because of their, albeit<br/>
brief, school experience, they believed that everything good came from<br/>
worksheets (which they despised by the way).<br/>
<br/>
I think having younger siblings helps with the understanding.  I pointed out<br/>
that I thought the kids could learn anything and didn&#39;t need me to decide<br/>
what they needed to know and to teach it to them.  I used the baby as an<br/>
example.  Who had taught her to sit up?  To crawl?  To walk?  To talk?  And<br/>
in English, yet?<br/>
<br/>
The kids were OK with that until Adriane hit a bump last year with the kids<br/>
at gymnastics quizzing her on multiplication facts and laughingly pointing<br/>
out that perhaps her mother shouldn&#39;t be teaching her.  Adriane wanted a<br/>
curriculum.  She was scared that life was going to pass her by, she would be<br/>
a failure, all because she didn&#39;t know 6x7 at the age of 10 off the top of<br/>
her head.<br/>
<br/>
We did all the standard &quot;look what you know that they don&#39;t know&quot;, etc., but<br/>
Adriane was really scared and sad.  So I dug out the old MathBlaster<br/>
computer game and got her a Spelling type computer game (she was also<br/>
worried about spelling).  Adriane worked day and night until she knew most<br/>
of the multiplication stuff.  I pointed out to her that she wanted to learn<br/>
something, she requested some resources and she taught herself.  VOILA!!<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The kids now are quite comfortable.<br/>
