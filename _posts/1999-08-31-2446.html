<div id="ygrps-yiv-895118402">Hi everyone!<br/>
    I&#39;ve received an attachment with a .vcf extension on a couple of my<br/>
lists now -- it shows up as a little rolodex card in the cornere of the<br/>
mail.<br/>
    Does anyone have any idea what this is?? I&#39;ve seen it as an attachment<br/>
to an e-mail in the past, but just once or twice, and now I&#39;m getting it a<br/>
lot!!<br/>
    I&#39;m a little concerned about this, and *have not* tried to run it, but<br/>
have *no idea* what it might be!!<br/>
    I&#39;m using Outlook Express 4.72*...* and Internet Explorer, btw.<br/>
TIA!<br/>

 enough bookshelves.&quot; -- Anna Quindlen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578175368">I think that little rolodex thing is comming from me, when I set up my new<br/>
signature at the bottom of my email, but how do I make that thing go away? I<br/>
will work on it, but it is harmless, it just has me in it its kind of<br/>
strange sorry for the inconvenience and  pardon me while I try to get rid of<br/>
it!<br/>
thanks Tanya Ohio<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28152985">Hi Tanya!<br/>
    Yes, it&#39;s gone now -- and hey, not a problem!<br/>
    I was just wondering what it was -- I had clicked on it, and was asked<br/>
if I wanted to open it or save it do disk, and so I cancelled.<br/>
    I assumed I shouldn&#39;t run it... I think I got one with the same<br/>
extension a year or so ago -- but it didn&#39;t look like a rollodex card -- I<br/>
didn&#39;t know better at the time, and so I ran it, but if I remember<br/>
correctly, my computer didn&#39;t know what to do with it anyway.<br/>
    Just wondered:)<br/>
THanks!<br/>
