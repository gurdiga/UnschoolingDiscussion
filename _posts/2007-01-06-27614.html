I  don&#39;t always enjoy the same shows Mo does, but its worth it to me <br/>
to share  her interests and discover ways to offer her more ideas and <br/>
options based  on those interests. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have come a long way in this department. From completely  controlling what <br/>
my oldest watched when he was young AND previewing every moment  of everything <br/>
he watched to letting go of my last hold out: Spongebob Square  Pants. Even <br/>
though I couldn&#39;t honestly say I like the show (I used to say I  hated it), I <br/>
do watch with Wyl some times, but on the days there are 2 or more  hour <br/>
marathons, I just can&#39;t bring myself to watch it all with him-even while  doing <br/>
something else while we watch.  Is there just a further step to this  and I haven&#39;t <br/>
reached the point yet where I can watch it for hours? I don&#39;t  control his <br/>
viewing any more. When I get to a point that it is just too much for  me, I <br/>
either go find something else to do or ask if we can watch something  else-usually <br/>
offering to record it for him to watch at another time. I can  sometimes <br/>
partially tune it out while I&#39;m in the room but my ability here is  limited, and <br/>
the theme song is too much for me. This particular  show is just one of those <br/>
things that provokes such a strong reaction in me  that it behooves me to delve <br/>
more deeply into the whys and wherefores of it all,  and I often get good <br/>
guidance from more experienced unschoolers on &quot;strong  reaction&quot; themes like this <br/>
(for me).  <br/>

Watching enough to know what it is helps.  If you know enough that if  <br/>
he tells you a story about something he saw you have an idea who the  <br/>
characters are is really great for him.<br/>

<br/>
When I start to feel the sharp grating jangly feeling, I try to  <br/>
breath through it and think GOOD thoughts about what they&#39;re doing  <br/>
and learning.   Marty listens to a lot of hip hop and rap music,  <br/>
which doesn&#39;t make me think lovely thoughts.  I  joke with him a  <br/>
couple of times that I was afraid it would make him steal cars.  But  <br/>
what I thought yesterday was &quot;He&#39;s preparing for the next time we  <br/>
play Encore, and I really want him on my team.&quot;  Plus, he sings  <br/>
along, and I like to hear his voice.   Those songs have TONS of  <br/>
words, and Marty has a good memory.  It all adds to his growing cross- <br/>
referenceable data-base of phrases and words and people and music and  <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
When I drive the car after Marty and he had the radio on to a station  <br/>
I don&#39;t usually listen to, I let the first whole song play and then I  <br/>
decide whether to change it or put something else in.  Since we don&#39;t  <br/>
ride in the car so much together anymore, I don&#39;t get to share  <br/>
directly.   A couple of times I&#39;ve been curious enough about the song  <br/>
to come home and ask him more.  Once he showed me the video of one of  <br/>
them, online.  The singer had died recently, and he knew the details  <br/>
of that.  (A female, so some of you might know; it was about a baby.   <br/>
I&#39;d ask him, but he&#39;s asleep.)<br/>
<br/>
At the second Live and Learn conference, at the end of the talent  <br/>
show, Bob Wilkinson started singing the Spongebob Squarepants  <br/>
themesong and the whole room exploded in happy sing-along.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know it because my kids are older and we don&#39;t have cable, but Marty  <br/>
(who was 14 that year) knew it from being at other people&#39;s houses or  <br/>
hearing it somewhere.  Holly (who wasn&#39;t there) knew it from hanging  <br/>
out with neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Probably some adults thought they were dumb in the 60&#39;s, but Keith  <br/>
and I were singing old TV themesongs for Holly a few weeks ago, and  <br/>
it turns out Keith remembered the whole song from F-Troop,which was a  <br/>
pretty cool song (a little like Super Chicken, which we also sang for  <br/>
her), but she knows some of those because we have a CD of TV theme  <br/>
songs.    Because Holly was so patient and attentive as we sang songs  <br/>
from shows she hadn&#39;t seen, for Christmas I found her a CD of more  <br/>
recent TV themesongs.  Many of them are just little instrumental bits  <br/>
because themesongs aren&#39;t generally as cool (or as long!) as they  <br/>
used to be; commercials are worth a lot more money now.   She was  <br/>
really happy with it and told me later some of the best things that  <br/>
were there.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m saying try to see the bigger picture.<br/>

<br/>
It was somewhat annoying to me too,, a few years ago.  Pre-unschooling. :)<br/>
<br/>
But gosh,, the joy that comes from that show.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some reasons why Kyra (ds9) loves Spongebob:<br/>
<br/>
1.  He&#39;s always happy.<br/>
2.  I learned what a goober was.  (She knew what goober was when playing Balderdash :D and a lot of adults didn&#39;t ;) (so its educational,,if that matters &lt;g&gt;  And that&#39;s from the Spongebob movie.  She says its a peanut, by the way.)<br/>
3.  His songs are awesome.  (We had to order a cd from the show.  And she got up at the Live and Learn conference and sang one. :D)<br/>
4.  His pet Gary always goes &quot;meow&quot;, who is a snail.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think if you can see the happiness and pleasure that comes to your child from these things, (shows/movies/games/music,or insert anything else that parents don&#39;t like), it can in turn wash over those feelings of discomfort or annoyance. <br/>
And it can bring a great joy to you too.  Its awesome. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880165645">When my kids were younger, I noticed that I could see the same movie with my<br/>
friends and with my kids and have two completely different reactions to the<br/>
movie. With my friends, I could just let loose and embrace the movie&#39;s<br/>
themes and issues and love the movie. I could hate the same movie when<br/>
seeing it with my kids, because I wouldn&#39;t like how the themes and issues<br/>
were handled, or the images being shown, or whatever. I was watching the<br/>
movie through different eyes. It was a subconscious thing...internally I was<br/>
concerned with how it was effecting my kids, mad that it wasn&#39;t introducing<br/>
something to them the way that I would.<br/>
<br/>
So this thought isn&#39;t exactly parallel with Spongebob, but I wonder if<br/>
Spongebob creates some of that with people. Maybe the silliness feels too<br/>
trivial? Or the characters seem too &quot;out there&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely LOVE Spongebob...love listening to my teenagers burst out in<br/>
the song out of nowhere, love watching the kids catch all the little jokes<br/>
and nuances that are strewn throughout (they catch these so much more than I<br/>
do), love the characters, storylines...it is just such a brilliant show.<br/>
<br/>
But with my kids all being teenagers, I may not have the sensitivities that<br/>
I might have if they were younger.  Not that it would change the unlimited<br/>
viewing...just that my own internal reaction may have been different than it<br/>
is now. Having that internal reaction has been something to watch for me. It<br/>
was work to recognize it as my own and not have it control a situation with<br/>
my children. I did take mental notes when my kids saw something that I<br/>
thought was really off to bring up in discussions later on. Usually they<br/>
were pretty insightful to what was going on. And the discussions were often<br/>
rich and useful.<br/>

one of my favorite memories.  Right before  you say &quot;ripped his <br/>

ripping sound.  We LOVE Sponge Bob here.  My oldest Carly married him <br/>
a few years ago.  She has a stuffed Sponge Bob and she invited <br/>
friends over and had the ceremony and reception.  Her friend Katie <br/>
had a huge Sponge Bob wearing a sombrero (El Sponge Bob-o) who <br/>
performed the ceremony.  All the girls dressed up.  It was cool.<br/>

My youngest 2 Jack and Jamie watched it with facination.   We were on <br/>
a trip and I was driving so I could only hear the dialogue.  It was <br/>
really funny to hear.  But they loved it.  After it was over, we were <br/>
talking about the shows and Bob remembered the old joke, &quot;where does <br/>
the Lone Ranger take his trash?&quot; ....<br/>
&quot;to the dump, to the dump, to the dump dump dump&quot;.  They totally got <br/>
it because they had just heard the theme song a few times with each <br/>
episode.  They have told the joke quite a bit since.  Older people <br/>
laugh, younger people look at them in confusion.<br/>

My 2c on Sponge,<br/>
<br/>
Intially through ignorance I avoided Spongebob for my two girls, but we<br/>
watched it at a friends house (about a year ago) and I realised there are<br/>
some wonderful themes in the shows.  Friendship, sharing, not being cowed by<br/>
people being unkind, honesty, yeah sounds cornball but it is done in a very<br/>
cool way. Sure it&#39;s silly but we love silly, there are too many people in<br/>
the world that take themselves way too seriously.<br/>
<br/>
So now I love Spongebob too and yes, we break out into tunes often and mimic<br/>
the voices of the characters.<br/>
<br/>
I also have older children and I do think I&#39;ve relaxed a lot over the years,<br/>
I still like to be around new movies to talk through anything the girls are<br/>
uncomfortable or curious about and I still cringe when they stumble across<br/>
music videos, I think most of them give a very bad ideal of woman.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other day i was cleaning out the storage room and found a big <br/>
box of old VHS movies. I had mentioned to Seamus previously, about a <br/>
movie called &quot;Baby&quot; about a dinosaur some scientists find in the <br/>
rain forest or something. Early to mid 80s, really bad special <br/>
effects compared to the post-&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; era. So when i found it <br/>
in this box, we played it, and i said &quot;Oh there&#39;s William Katt!&quot; and <br/>
started singing The Greatest American Hero theme song. It was HUGE <br/>
at the time of the (short lived)TV show, but of course Seamus didnt <br/>
recognize it. We have the series coming on Netflix too...i was <br/>
looking for info on &quot;V&quot; (the miniseries and tv show from &#39;83-&#39;85)on <br/>
IMDB (talk about connections....everything is connected there! <br/>
wow...)and was led to different pages for all the shows of my <br/>
childhood. There was a show i really wanted to get from Netflix <br/>
called Voyagers! that isnt available, about a boy who&#39;s dad is a <br/>
history professor, the kid gets basically stuck travelling through <br/>
time with this &quot;Voyager&quot; guy. And because the kid knows alot about <br/>
history, and the Voyager doesnt, the kid is helpful. Incidentally, <br/>
the kid actor is Meeno Peluce, who is the half brother of Soleil <br/>
Moon Fry who was &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. I read the Peluce is now a <br/>
teacher at Hollywood High...or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
We watched the entire &quot;V&quot; series including the two mini-series and <br/>
all the tv show episodes, and had a bunch of interesting <br/>
conversations about special effects, clothing, music...not to <br/>
mention about how a perfectly entertaining miniseries can degerate <br/>
to the point of being almost ridiculous and unwatchable by the last <br/>
episode. We talked about the really successful and famous actors who <br/>
were on V early in their careers (like Michael Ironside and Robert <br/>
Englund)...on and on. Plus it was really fun to watch together. If <br/>
Greatest American Hero is painful to watch, i have no problem <br/>
sending it right back, which is the great thing about Netflix, no <br/>
commitment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i&#39;m just so amazed when people complain about tv. We love <br/>
tv. Lots and Lots. My son has been watching Naruto online, i think <br/>
he&#39;s watched 200 episodes or something, all thats available on <br/>
YouTube. I LOVE that he loves it. I think its GREAT when kids are so <br/>
passionate about something, i don&#39;t care what it is. In fact, i <br/>
think i need to at least watch a couple of episodes of Naruto since <br/>
i don&#39;t know anything about it, and if he likes it so much there is <br/>
probably *something* about it i will enjoy. I&#39;d like to be able to <br/>
have a conversation about the characters and plotlines and not be <br/>
lost. <br/>
<br/>
A mother on a non-HSing list i&#39;m on was complaining about her son <br/>
staying up late watching Naruto. Like it was an addiction. I just <br/>
don&#39;t get it. <br/>

Some moms are unhappy and want something to blame.<br/>
Some moms thought maybe they would be the center of their children&#39;s  <br/>
universes until wedding days or something.<br/>

It mystifies me, and embarrasses me, when other moms don&#39;t revel in  <br/>

children are intelligent people who are making choices based on  <br/>
what&#39;s interesting and thought-provoking.<br/>

Some people are jealous not to be in other people&#39;s thoughts all the  <br/>

Mine are 3 and just turned 6.  We love Spongebob and it&#39;s one of their favorites that DH and I enjoy too.  I guess we kind of encourage it because it makes family viewing more tolerable; I can&#39;t sit through Dora and if Baby Bear is on Sesame Street I have to leave the room for fear of chucking the TV through the window.<br/>

Some things are hard to wrap your head around. If it&#39;s not familiar to you so you shun it.  I noticed I had been doing that with my son and his games. So I have tried get more involved in my son interests. We all got game boy advances and my son insisted we all get the same fire red version Pokee&#39;mon game so we can trade and link up. Despite my resistance at first, and to my surprise, I&#39;m having loads of fun playing the game and collecting all the creatures.  I just collected a rare Snorlax and was jumping and squealing like a little girl when I caught it. My DH and son had lost their opportunity to catch one so it was a huge deal.  My son caught me a Ponyta and traded it to me and I caught a Pokemon and am raising it in the day care to trade to my son later when it levels up to a higher level.  I told him he can borrow my Snorlax sense he doesn&#39;t have one and he can never catch one. He was so thrilled to have us as a buddy on the game.   <br/>
<br/>
Any way we were at bowling last week and I was talking to this other little boy and I told him about my rare catch of the Snorlax and he was so surprised that I had a game boy let alone was playing a Pokemon game.  I had to bring out my game to prove it. We stated talking game strategy and I told him how I finally caught my Snorlax and he was like wow!!! that was good strategy. Then he said something that was really surprising. He told me how wonderful it was to talk to me because us old parents hardly ever make attempt to learn or like what they, the kids  are interested in. He said how cool it was that I was playing a &quot;kids game&quot; and how he wished more parents and old people would do that.   Yes we&#39;re old people to them UGH...<br/>
<br/>
There are some of the new games I just can&#39;t play or watch at all.  I actually get vertigo watching them, nauseous and very sick. UGH some are just awful . I had started rejecting them and refused to be around them at all with my son. It really started showing the disconnect between us. I had to find a way to be involved and understand the game strategy with out playing and watching the games.  I then showed him how to google game cheat codes and figure out how to reach different levels and different sections. He always on my computer printing off game stuff and reading up about the games. And because I have found other ways to be involved he now knows I was not just ignoring his interests but that I have a reason for not playing most of the games he loves.<br/>
<br/>
But it looked like I just hated all games. He felt bad,  he wanted to share all this exciting info and game stuff with me but didn&#39;t as he thought I would be negative and put it down. He was unhappy because he felt he couldn&#39;t talk to me about a very important part of his life,  his games.  I know this because my wise little boy told me so.  That&#39;s when I realized I had been sending him the wrong message.   <br/>
<br/>
Now we have one or two games we can play.  I still have our very first Nintendo game station and I pulled out the first Zelda game and the first Mario bro. game. Now those I can play.  I may not be able to play all the games but I can ask him if he got to the next level or if he found the item he was looking for or what ever it is. And I can  learn as much about the game as possible.  He knows  that I know the names of the characters and the goals of the game and we talk to each other about the games.  He&#39;s not trying to hide or keep to himself something that is important to him. He knows he can come to me about anything. It saddened me that he was unhappy thinking I disapproved of something he really enjoyed, that some how this disapproval was how I felt about him too. That&#39;s how he was seeing it. I hope he now knows different.  T <br/>

  -=-A mother on a non-HSing list i&#39;m on was complaining about her son<br/>
  staying up late watching Naruto. Like it was an addiction. I just<br/>
  don&#39;t get it.<br/>

  Some moms are unhappy and want something to blame.<br/>
  Some moms thought maybe they would be the center of their children&#39;s <br/>
  universes until wedding days or something.<br/>
<br/>
  It mystifies me, and embarrasses me, when other moms don&#39;t revel in <br/>
  their children&#39;s interests, and when moms don&#39;t assume that their <br/>
  children are intelligent people who are making choices based on <br/>
  what&#39;s interesting and thought-provoking.<br/>
<br/>
  Some people are jealous not to be in other people&#39;s thoughts all the <br/>
  time, maybe. Or for others to have thoughts they didn&#39;t approve or <br/>
  initiate.<br/>

  One time a homeschooling mom gushed that homeschooling was wonderful <br/>
  because &quot;you get to be your child&#39;s only teacher.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>SpongeBob uses language in really funny ways - LOTS of puns. So maybe  <br/>
you could enjoy it if you focused on the idea that your child is  <br/>
enjoying playing with words/language. After years of unschooling, you  <br/>
won&#39;t any longer feel a need to look for the learning that is  <br/>
happening because you&#39;ll be confident that learning WILL happen  <br/>
whether you watch for it or not &lt;G&gt;. But, when kids are little and  <br/>
parents are just getting started unschooling, it isn&#39;t a bad idea to  <br/>
pay attention to what the child might be learning from their chosen  <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
If you support their interests, you&#39;re are supporting learning.  <br/>
Starting when their young means you have a kid who still loves to  <br/>
learn when he/she reaches the ages that most kids in the wider  <br/>
population have become dulled, resistant, apathetic.<br/>
<br/>
It is a worthy goal and not discounting the interests of your child  <br/>
EVEN when they don&#39;t fit your image of valuable learning activities  <br/>
is a big step toward it.<br/>

you could do besides read that book? How about getting that crocheting<br/>

<br/>
By taking this control in your home, you are putting your preferences over<br/>
your relationship with your child(ren).<br/>
<br/>
That may not seem like a problem, and in fact may even seem to be the way it<br/>
should be, but it is not in line with the philosophy of unschooling. The<br/>
more you say &quot;yes&quot; and get into your child&#39;s interests, the more you see<br/>
through the wonder of your child&#39;s eyes, the more you embrace what your<br/>
child likes and stop saying &quot;not going to happen in this house&quot;, the<br/>
stronger your bond with your child will be (for a lifetime!) and the richer<br/>
your lives will be together. There a many of us who know this, who live it,<br/>
and who can vouch for it.<br/>

The kids get a kick out of Dora language (which is incredibly repetitious)<br/>

8yo said: &quot;Seatbelts! So we can be safe!&quot; which they say in the show any<br/>
time someone gets into a vehicle. Everyone laughed. My 8yo also &quot;plays Dora&quot;<br/>
with them, which she enjoys and which delights the younger ones.<br/>

Also, both the 2yo and the 5yo are *very* into maps, which seems to be<br/>
something that came from watching Dora.<br/>

and shaping a child into an admirable adult (who demonstrates what a  <br/>
good job she&#39;s doing by passing through admirable child stages on  <br/>
their way to adulthood.)<br/>
<br/>
When a child has ideas and likes that are different from what the mom  <br/>
has in mind as ideal, it, she feels, reflects on her abilities as a  <br/>
mother.<br/>
<br/>
How many mothers would feel it speaks of their excellent parenting if  <br/>
their child prefers nature shows to SpongeBob, checks out huge piles  <br/>
of nonfiction books from the library, is a competitive gymnast at 12?<br/>
<br/>
How many mothers would feel it speaks of their failure as a parent if  <br/>
their child spends huge amounts of time playing video games or  <br/>
skateboarding or trading fart jokes?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably part of the children born as sinful creatures idea.  <br/>
Presumably anyone can raise a child who loves TV. It&#39;s what children  <br/>
will do naturally (it&#39;s assumed). But it (presumably) takes special  <br/>
skill to raise a child who turns from TV and enjoys reading the  <br/>
classics.<br/>
<br/>
Our children&#39;s choices are for many moms a reflection of their  <br/>
abilities as parents.<br/>
<br/>
I think those moms should get over it ;-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; But gosh,, the joy that comes from that show.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s some reasons why Kyra (ds9) loves Spongebob:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.  He&#39;s always happy.<br/>
&gt; 2.  I learned what a goober was.  (She knew what goober was when playing<br/>
&gt; Balderdash :D and a lot of adults didn&#39;t ;) (so its educational,,if that<br/>
&gt; matters &lt;g&gt;  And that&#39;s from the Spongebob movie.  She says its a peanut, by<br/>
&gt; the way.)<br/>
&gt; 3.  His songs are awesome.  (We had to order a cd from the show.  And she got<br/>
&gt; up at the Live and Learn conference and sang one. :D)<br/>
&gt; 4.  His pet Gary always goes &quot;meow&quot;, who is a snail.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think if you can see the happiness and pleasure that comes to your child<br/>
&gt; from these things, (shows/movies/games/music,or insert anything else that<br/>
&gt; parents don&#39;t like), it can in turn wash over those feelings of discomfort or<br/>
&gt; annoyance. <br/>
&gt; And it can bring a great joy to you too.  Its awesome. :)<br/>
