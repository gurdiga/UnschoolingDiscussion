<div id="ygrps-yiv-979331520">&lt;&lt;Good luck with your baby.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! :)  He&#39;s so funny.  My husband makes a Donald Duck noise to talk to <br/>
him....why he chose that I don&#39;t know...and every time you talk to him in a <br/>
Donald Duck voice he flutters his wings and opens wide up for food.  It is <br/>
so hilarious!  When I hold him he jumps up on my shoulder and snuggles his <br/>
beak behind my ear and goes to sleep.  I tell ya, it&#39;s hard not to just fall <br/>
in love with him and want to keep him forever.  My husband is trying to <br/>
convince me that we need to keep him so I&#39;m hoping one day, during our <br/>
outdoor excursions, that he will just up and fly away.  I know it will be <br/>
bittersweet but I really want to see him happy and free.  We have lovely <br/>
trees and a plethora of birds in the neighborhood.  Today, we watched a <br/>
family of morning doves feeding.  There were four babies and they kept <br/>
falling off the feeding perch.  It was so cute to watch them study their <br/>
next move and figure out how to get back up that high.  The momma bird would <br/>
stand behind them and push them and just sing and sing.  We were all in the <br/>
girls room watching through the window while my grandparents were watching <br/>
from their kitchen.  What a nice moment for us all.<br/>
<br/>
They have an elaborate bird viewing set-up between our houses....various <br/>
houses, feeders and bird attracting flora so it is a great place to live if <br/>
you are a bird, or enjoy bird watching!  I&#39;d be happy for our little fella <br/>
to live out his life here.  I just hope he is ready to go before we move. :(<br/>

great feeling to set them free too. A little sad but a rather good <br/>
feeling knowing they will get the CHANCE {yes they could also go and <br/>
get hit in the road but I wish for the best} to be free and have <br/>
babies of their own.<br/>
I see some of the squirrels out gathering their food and know they <br/>
most likely have families of their own.  :-)<br/>
