<div id="ygrps-yiv-165485970">I was scanning my news this morning and something caught my eye.<br/>
 <br/>
FORT GIBSON, Okla. (Dec. 6) - Four students at a rural middle school were <br/>
shot this morning and a middle school student was taken into custody.<br/>
Superintendent Steve Wilmoth said students were gathered outside before the 8 <br/>
a.m. start of classes. &#39;&#39;Another student just walked up and opened fire on <br/>
them,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;From what I know at this point it seems to be a random <br/>
thing.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Another child in yet another school harming friends. What is happening to <br/>
children in our nation? I am quickly forming the thoughts of prayer for <br/>
everyone involved. These children will live with the horror of this event for <br/>
all their days. My thoughts are racing and the question &quot;Why?&quot; stands out. <br/>
<br/>
How many of these children will be mentally damaged? For as I think about <br/>
this (another shooting in our public schools), I think of my brother. A man <br/>
who spent time fighting in Viet Nam. Will these children relive this tragedy <br/>
much like he relives the forest? I am truly disheartened and ill at the <br/>
thoughts of it all.<br/>
