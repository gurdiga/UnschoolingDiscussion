&gt; Subject: Stories for a Book by William Sears<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Bill and Martha Sears are currently collecting material for a book<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; working title of &quot;Kids Who Turned Out Right: What Their Parents Did.&quot;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; asked me, their long-time research assistant and editor, to collect<br/>
&gt; stories<br/>
&gt; and anecdotes  from families who practice co-sleeping, gentle<br/>
&gt; discipline,<br/>
&gt; long-term breastfeeding, minimal mother-baby separation, etc., families<br/>
&gt; who,<br/>
&gt; in general, make babies and children their number-one priority.<br/>
&gt;     These might be stories about your own kids, or stories from your<br/>
&gt; practice. They might be about kids who are grown-up, or nearly so,  or<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; grade-school kids or even preschoolers and toddlers.<br/>
&gt;     Besides using anecdotal informtion, Bill is collecting research. He<br/>
&gt; really wants to demonstrate that attachment parenting makes a<br/>
&gt; difference.<br/>
&gt; This book will be published by his regular publisher, Little Brown,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>

&gt;     Is there something wonderful about your kids or about families<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve<br/>
