Program for 2003-2004<br/>
<br/>
In the last 18 mos., we embarked on a program of unschooling. C has <br/>
always been a willing student, eager to do whatever asked of her. <br/>
Still, we decided that she thrives when allowed to follow her <br/>
particular fascinations (of which she has many).<br/>
<br/>
In the school year of 2003-2004, C spent her time in the following ways:<br/>
<br/>
TV Viewing<br/>
C is keenly interested in the construction of the situation-comedy. She <br/>
can be heard throughout the house imitating her favorite characters and <br/>
actors. She has been known to tell me what makes one show effective and <br/>
what makes another trite or predictable. She is able to identify <br/>
stereotypical characters, caricature and bad dialog. She also has <br/>
developed an unbelievable vocabulary that I can only attribute to TV. <br/>
She�s really clever with irony and puns. One of my favorite comments of <br/>
hers: �All the Disney villains are so predictable.� She went on to <br/>
elucidate the qualities that make a Disney villain.  Go C!<br/>
<br/>
Bird Watching<br/>
C loved watching birds with us this year. She has learned to identify <br/>
most backyard birds and helped with recording which ones visited the <br/>
feeder. She also helped us stock the feeder with seed.<br/>
<br/>
Reading and Language Arts<br/>
C is learning to read. She is still working on the phonics of reading <br/>
and has made lots of progress, though she still isn�t reading fluently. <br/>
  We�ve used some workbooks (Explode the Code) because she likes to <br/>
write in them, but mostly learn phonetics using techniques shown to me <br/>
by a reading specialist.  She loves to write and has filled oodles of <br/>
notebooks with letters and �writing� that is her own. She�s working <br/>
through the Frog and Toad series right now reading a little bit each <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
I�ve read aloud to her from the Girls of Many Lands books (from <br/>
American Girl) and we�ve enjoyed creating question and answer games for <br/>
those. She easily narrates the contents when asked about the stories.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite moments came when she set up her five dolls on a <br/>
specially designed, tiered stand. She put the English doll in the <br/>
middle and at first had the Indian (India) doll next to her. C <br/>
exclaimed: �Wait. I can�t put the India doll next to England. They hate <br/>
each other.� She began to remind me of the conflicts between India and <br/>
England that we had read about in the book. Then she had to decide who <br/>
could be next to England since China and France also had histories with <br/>
the British that included war.<br/>
<br/>
She enjoys a wide variety of literature and we read aloud every day.<br/>
<br/>
She also participated in our language games that produced limericks and <br/>
scrounged poetry. She loves to read and learn poems.<br/>
<br/>
I read the last three Harry Potter books aloud to the kids during our <br/>
read aloud times in addition to reading poetry. And we make nearly <br/>
weekly library visits.<br/>
<br/>
In co-op, she studied the Beatrix Potter books and created several <br/>
projects that detailed BP�s work. She easily narrated to me what she <br/>
learned and what she enjoyed. She also took �Let�s Read and Write.�<br/>
<br/>
Math<br/>
For math, we took an eclectic approach. C did do some of the Miquon <br/>
math books I have for her and Jon bought her two traditional math books <br/>
from the supermarket. But C finds the abstract concepts harder to grasp <br/>
that way so we use them only intermittently (she likes writing in <br/>
�official books� but they often hinder more than help). More often, we <br/>
used math books like: [I]Family Math[/I], [I]The I Hate Mathematics <br/>
Book[/I] and other resources from the library. We also used the <br/>
Internet for creative math ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Several games helped to reinforce math concepts:<br/>
Monopoly<br/>
Poison<br/>
Dots<br/>
Yahtzee<br/>
Lentil Measuring<br/>
Managing her money<br/>
Counting games<br/>
<br/>
C is also endlessly fascinated with patterns. Currently she has an <br/>
entire collection of cut outs from magazines that she pins to a <br/>
bulletin board in endless arrangements based on their similarities and <br/>
differences. She might put all the long skinny models in one corner and <br/>
all the short square ones in another. Then she matches the �bling <br/>
bling� (jewelry) to go with them based on color or shape or size.<br/>
<br/>
She constantly organizes the house, her room and her belongings into <br/>
arrangements based on her need to see patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Greek<br/>
Amazingly, though C can�t yet read English fluently, she is fascinated <br/>
by ancient Greek and has learned the alphabet. We�ve worked on both <br/>
lower case and upper case letters as well as knowing how to pronounce <br/>
the names of the letters. She has her own Greek notebook and keeps a <br/>
list of our names written in Greek. We sometimes spend several days in <br/>
a row working on Greek and then take some time off. She�s always <br/>
interested in doing more.<br/>
<br/>
Sports<br/>
C played soccer in both fall and spring. And she took gym during co-op. <br/>
She swims at the YMCA and she danced this summer in a ballet five-week <br/>
workshop as well. One thing I like about C and sports is that she is <br/>
highly motivated to practice at home. We play soccer in the backyard <br/>
and she loves to dance in the living room using books from the library <br/>
to guide her.<br/>
<br/>
History/Geography<br/>
The American Girl books from India, China, and Turkey were our primary <br/>
resources for history this year. We learned about the Indian revolt <br/>
against Britain (1939), the Opium War in Canton (1857), and we studied <br/>
life in a harem in Turkey (1720).<br/>
<br/>
C turned her knowledge into a card game making questions and answers <br/>
for the details of the books. She played with the dolls as well as <br/>
identified the places mentioned in the books on the globe.<br/>
<br/>
We watched �Bend It Like Beckham� many, many times too.  That movie <br/>
combined her love of Britain, soccer and India.<br/>
<br/>
She participated in our geography work from �Map the World by Heart.� <br/>
She learned about longitude and latitude as well as flags. She tasted <br/>
Chinese food for the first time this year as well.<br/>
<br/>
We read several chapters from Story of the World and took time to read <br/>
stories from 1001 Arabian nights. The kids loved these. We did several <br/>
of the projects that are a part of SOTW including a Roman banner, <br/>
Chinese lanterns and clay pots. We also looked at maps.<br/>
<br/>
Art<br/>
C loves art so we watched the Sister Wendy video series again. We <br/>
visited the art museum many times and she took art at the co-op. She�s <br/>
prolific with design type drawings preferring them to portraits and <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Films/TV<br/>
�Pride and Prejudice�<br/>
�Lord of the Rings: Return of the King� (and a repeat of the whole <br/>
trilogy including hours and hours and hours of behind the scenes <br/>
material about film making, script writing etc.)<br/>
�Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban�<br/>
�Newsies� (musical about the history of newspapers in the late 1800s in <br/>
NYC)<br/>
�Tornadoes� � History of tornadoes<br/>
�Sinbad� � she loves mythology so we had fun with this since it related <br/>
to our reading of the 1001 Arabian Nights.<br/>
