<div id="ygrps-yiv-824409716"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I am new and have never posted before. I feel like I have sailed a rough <br/>
&gt;&gt;sea and finally found dry land - and that is a modest way of saying <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Welcome Michele. Glad to have you here on our little unschooling island. <br/>
May I offer you a lovely Pina Colada? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am SO happy to have finally found exactly what I have been looking <br/>
&gt;&gt;for.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling offers such freedom for both you and your children. Living and <br/>
learning, the perfect combination.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how our kids will find a way to let us know what they really <br/>

<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
