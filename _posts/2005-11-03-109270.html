&gt; law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the<br/>
&gt; penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience<br/>
&gt; tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of<br/>
&gt; imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over<br/>
&gt; its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.&quot;<br/>

Not registering to homeschool is an omission, not an overt act.   There&#39;s no <br/>
good way to overtly not file a form.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that MLK would encourage people to go out and announce to all their <br/>
neighbors if they were cohabiting without marriage, or commiting adultry, or <br/>
have technically illegal sex.    It&#39;s one of those privacy-of-the-home matters, <br/>
when a family is unschooling.   It&#39;s not a crime with a victim outside the <br/>
home, nor a victim inside the home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a <br/>
willingness to accept the<br/>
penalty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems he was talking about segregation laws.   That&#39;s not parallel to <br/>
homeschooling vs. school, nor to registration vs. non-registration.   <br/>
<br/>
When so many people were living together that it would have been silly to <br/>
have charged one couple with the crime of cohabitation, that&#39;s when that law <br/>
became silly.    When so many people&#39;s children have grown up without school and <br/>
without having been registered homeschoolers that it would be silly to charge <br/>
one family with failing to register, that&#39;s when that law will become silly.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no advantage to a single couple saying &quot;Guess what?   We&#39;re not <br/>
married!&quot;<br/>
