<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003110809">Jim Trelease has done research, written several books, and has a website<br/>
on reading.  He comes from a &quot;schooling&quot; perspective, but mentions many<br/>
points that I believe support an unschooling viewpoint.  One of his<br/>
points is that many people don&#39;t enjoy reading because of 12 years of<br/>
being told what to read and then having to write reports on it!  I heard<br/>
him speak last spring and my write-up of that follows.  Feel free to skip<br/>
it and go straight to his website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trelease-on-reading.com">http://www.trelease-on-reading.com</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Jim Trelease, author of The Read Aloud Handbook, entertained and<br/>
motivated a small audience of parents and educators in Kennewick on the<br/>
subject of reading aloud to children.  His presentation focused on the<br/>
idea that reading skills are critical to success in school and beyond and<br/>
suggested ways to make reading aloud part of your family&#39;s lifestyle. <br/>
Trelease was honored by the International Reading Association as one of<br/>
eight people who made the largest contributions to reading in the 1980&#39;s.<br/>
Besides his New Read-Aloud Handbook, Trelease is also the author of Hey!<br/>
Listen to This: Stories to Read Aloud, and Read All About It!: Great<br/>
Read-Aloud Stories, Poems, and Newspaper Pieces for Preteens and Teens.<br/>
As with most activities, children improve their reading skills by �<br/>
reading!  At first, children learn to read.  Then they read to learn. <br/>
Trelease says that self-education begins with the knowledge that you can<br/>
read whatever you want for your own purposes. Yet many children associate<br/>
reading with work, rather than pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Reading aloud to your child gives your child background knowledge of the<br/>
world, provides the child with a &quot;reading role model&quot;, and conditions the<br/>
child to associate reading with pleasure.  In Becoming A Nation of<br/>
Readers, the Commission on Reading reports, &quot;The single most important<br/>
activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in<br/>
reading is reading aloud to children.&quot; Trelease stressed that reading<br/>
aloud should continue even after children learn to read for themselves. <br/>
A child&#39;s ability to listen exceeds his ability to read, often by several<br/>
grade levels.  In print, language is more complicated and sophisticated<br/>
than in speech.  So by reading aloud to a child, you increase the<br/>
exposure to words and styles of grammar not usually encountered in daily<br/>
conversations.  While The Reading Foundation is encouraging parents to<br/>
read to their children 20 minutes a day, Trelease goes further, calling<br/>
for at least 30 to 45 minutes every day.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t insist that you throw out your TV, but Trelease did suggest<br/>
that controlling your child&#39;s viewing habits would make a difference. <br/>
Trelease presented graphs showing the correlation between the number of<br/>
hours eighth graders watched TV and their scores on reading tests.  As<br/>
you might expect, more TV viewing was linked with lower test scores. <br/>
There was a similar relation between TV viewing and math scores.  One<br/>
curious anomaly was found in Finland.  These eighth graders watched many<br/>
hours of television and had high reading scores.  Upon closer<br/>
examination, it was found that 50% of television shows in Finland are<br/>
imported and these foreign shows are broadcast with Finnish subtitles. In<br/>
effect, these children were actually reading their TV!  Trelease pointed<br/>
out that you could mimic this by setting your TV to &quot;close captioned&quot; and<br/>
turning off the volume.<br/>
Forget the worksheets and expensive phonics programs, Trelease said. <br/>
These do not motivate kids to read.  He suggested that you spend your<br/>
money instead on the &quot;3 B&#39;s&quot;, to complement the &quot;3 R&#39;s&quot; of schooling:  <br/>
�(1) Books as gifts.  Bookstores, yard sales, and the Internet are all<br/>
sources of books to enjoy.  Trelease made a joke of comparing a new $12<br/>
copy of Charlotte&#39;s Web with one found at a yard sale for 25 cents. <br/>
&quot;They have the same words!&quot; he said.<br/>
�(2) Book Baskets. Trelease recommended that parents put baskets of books<br/>
anywhere in the house where children may be a captive audience, such as<br/>
the bathroom or the dining table.  He said we shouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>
&quot;messing up&quot; a book when the important thing is to encourage reading.<br/>
�(3) Bed lamps.  According to leading opthomologists, Trelease said, it<br/>
is physically impossible to ruin your eyes by reading in bed!<br/>
<br/>
The inspiring presentation wound up with suggestions of many wonderful<br/>
books to read aloud.  In the Read Aloud Handbook, Trelease lists 1400<br/>
titles ranging from wordless picture books to chapter books.  He pointed<br/>
out that many of our popular stories come from more than one country. <br/>
Reading several versions of a story can enlarge your child&#39;s view of the<br/>
world.  You can visit Trelease on the web at:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428355509">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son is 6 years old and shows little interest in reading yet.  He&#39;s<br/>
much more curious about numbers.  I&#39;m not concerned, some grandparents<br/>
are a bit.  There are so many ways to learn besides reading.  I&#39;ll<br/>
probably start getting anxious if he doesn&#39;t show interest by next<br/>
year.  But then again I know another friend who said her daughter was<br/>
too busy jumping over couches till age 8 and by 8 1/2 she was all caught<br/>
up to her &quot;peers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
On Mondays we are volunteering for an hour or so to pet and play with<br/>
cats at an animal shelter.  We might walk small dogs too.  We also help<br/>
at a birthday party at a nursing home once a month.  Does anyone else do<br/>
volunteer work?<br/>

**Sherry, please don&#39;t worry next year if your son still isn&#39;t interested.<br/>
He may not be ready physically. If you haven&#39;t read anything by the Moores,<br/>
I&#39;d suggest it. The Successful Homeschool Family Handbook is good. Also, you<br/>
could read Homeschooling for Excellence by the Colfaxes, whose son didn&#39;t<br/>
learn to read until 9 but was reading at college level in 2 years and then<br/>
went on to Harvard.<br/>

<br/>
**This sounds like very cool volunteer work. We do a lot of different<br/>
things. There&#39;s always something happening through our church. We just<br/>
finished a Habitat for Humanity project. Built 5 houses in 5 days, all on<br/>
one street. There&#39;s the &quot;Lutheran House&quot; the &quot;Presbyterian House&quot;, etc. For<br/>
this project, we just collected our change. My 2 yo isn&#39;t ready for<br/>
carpentry. We make get-well letters for people we know and for some we just<br/>
hear about. We make goodies for nursing homes. We sponsor kids at Christmas.<br/>
(I esp like the one through Samaritan&#39;s Purse, where you fill a shoebox with<br/>
goodies with a boy or girl of a certain age in mind and these boxes are sent<br/>
all over the world to kids who wouldn&#39;t otherwise receive anything). We also<br/>
sponsor 2 sisters in Peru through World Vision. My 2 older girls are in 4-H.<br/>
They do yard clean-up for disabled people, food drives, park maintenance,<br/>
where ever they see a need they try to fill it. Sometimes we have a &quot;Clean<br/>
the World Day&quot; where we go out for a stroll and don&#39;t come home until we<br/>
fill several bags with trash. (Today might be a good day for that...hmmmm) I<br/>
can&#39;t even think of all the service things we do. It&#39;s just a way of life.<br/>
And that&#39;s how I want the kids to look at it, also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399497575">&lt;&lt;&lt;On Mondays we are volunteering for an hour or so to pet and play with<br/>
&lt;&lt;cats at an animal shelter.  We might walk small dogs too.  We also help<br/>

&lt;&lt;volunteer work?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t volunteer.  But my mother has Alzheimers & I&#39;ve put her in an<br/>
assisted living facility.  The kids (7,4&2) go with me every week to visit<br/>
her.  The kids are usually very well behaved (avoid their nap times -  bad<br/>
timing) & a hit with the other residents.  I wasn&#39;t sure how mine would<br/>
respond.  I remember visiting my grandfather when I was 5 or 6 in a VA<br/>
hospital & being scared.  The kids at first were shy but after a few visits<br/>
they were giving hugs to lots of the ladies & shaking hands with the men.<br/>
DD says it&#39;s like she&#39;s taking the place of their grandchildren who must<br/>
live too far away to visit.  DS 4 is shy off & on & doesn&#39;t like it when his<br/>
grandma doesn&#39;t know him.  DS 2 loves the attention from everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The sad part is my parents never had time to spend with the kids when they<br/>
were well.  My father died 2 yrs ago & mom was with Alzheimers enough for me<br/>
to get guardianship a year later.  So this has been a great time for them.<br/>
Even though she&#39;s lost parts of her memory she&#39;s sweet with them, gives them<br/>
lots of attention, talks to them & hugs them.  Something she was slow to do<br/>
even when I was growing up.  (Do you think it had anything to do with her<br/>
being a ps teacher?)<br/>
<br/>
Ok off the soap box.</div>

one that manifests itself in different ways amongst the cultures that <br/>
do. Some written languages code individual sounds (alphabetic, like <br/>

It&#39;s not &quot;natural&quot; for streets to be laid out with street names and numbered <br/>
houses, yet in every town or city in which human culture has developed such a <br/>
system, the residents learn it without having to take a class with a test at <br/>
the end.  Some people end up needing to prove that they know the system, either <br/>
by a test or by practical proof (cab drivers, police officers, ambulance and <br/>
fire truck drivers).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, but again, there is a semantical issue here because this <br/>
term &quot;natural&quot; is being thrown around by different people who are <br/>
using it in different contexts. If we&#39;re going to use &quot;natural&quot; to <br/>
mean what is inherent and normal to a particular culture, then yes, <br/>
one could say that it is natural to learn to read in an environment <br/>
where reading is the norm. Then again, using that same context, one <br/>
can also say that it is natural for young girls in Eastern Turkey to <br/>
marry when they are teenagers, because that is the norm there as <br/>
well. But is the act of marrying young, and in fact the institution <br/>
of marriage itself, a &quot;natural process&quot; in the scientific way that <br/>
other people are taking the term to mean? No, it&#39;s a cultural <br/>
invention, just like writing is. Speaking is biologically natural for <br/>
humans, and coupling is biologically natural for humans; reading and <br/>
marriage are culturally-specific concepts which may or may not be <br/>
natural to a particular human, dependent on what kind of culture the <br/>
human is in.<br/>
<br/>
All humans all over the world learn to walk and talk at roughly the <br/>
same time. Even babies who are woefully neglected in orphanages <br/>
manage to figure out how to at move on their own and at least make <br/>
babbling noises even if they&#39;re not spoken to. Those are &quot;natural <br/>
processes&quot; in the scientific context--they are universally <br/>
instinctual human behaviors. One cannot say the same thing about <br/>
reading; there is no instinct to specifically read per se, only an <br/>
instinct to learn. IF there is written language present in your <br/>
environment, then yes, that instinct to learn will probably make <br/>
you &quot;naturally&quot; want to learn to read those symbols at some point.<br/>

Someone who&#39;s got a really big &quot;nature sense&quot; (the 8th of Gardner&#39;s 7 <br/>
intelligences &lt;bwg&gt;) would do GREAT in some cultures, be a leader!  But in modern <br/>
American culture, few care about nature sense at all.  We have a friend who would <br/>
just go insane in a city.  His nature sense is his best thing.  He was a <br/>
smoke-jumper, forest-fire-fighter for years.  THERE he is strong and able and <br/>
quick and suave, in the forest.  In a classroom he&#39;s a mess!   <br/>
<br/>
Someone who was going to have a harder time learning to read ANYwhere would <br/>
do better in an Amazon tribe without any writing.  (If he can be born naturally <br/>
in that tribe, I mean, not parachuted in in a baby-basket.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone without much artistic sense might have had a hard time writing in <br/>
Chinese 500 years ago.  Now they have word processing (amazing, with pulldown <br/>

There are people who come to unschooling REALLY hoping for people to say, <br/>
&quot;OH, sure, no, your kids won&#39;t learn naturally.  Don&#39;t feel bad if you keep <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not willing to help parents cop out on getting to  natural learning once <br/>
they&#39;ve expressed a real interest, and I&#39;m not at ALL interested in anyone <br/>

that their later reader might actually have a learning disability which<br/>
would make it much harder or impossible.  That&#39;s what happened with me.<br/>
When I brought my worries about reading on another list when Lars was almost<br/>
12 and not reading, someone mentioned an unschooling family in which all the<br/>
kids turned out to have a learning disability.  Apparently the mother felt<br/>
horribly guilty for not finding this out until the oldest was 14.  Well that<br/>
got *this* mother feeling guilty and worried enough to push phonics on a kid<br/>
who was probably just about ready to crack reading on his own if I had just<br/>
let him.  Instead he learned to read but also dislike reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632578045">Hi all~<br/>
Just wanted to share a few comments on reading.  My son is 6 and has been<br/>
trying to read since about 4.  He has been read to a lot as he has a sister<br/>
5 years older.  While he was an infant, and toddler he was always listening<br/>
in to her stories and as she was older, many books were chapter books.  I<br/>
say he has been trying to read because he has never been taught, rather<br/>
trying on his own accord.  At around 4 he would occasionally ask what some<br/>
word was on the page...usually a big word like &quot;CRASH&quot;  or<br/>
&quot;BOOM&quot;...something that was written in bold colors and that I would have<br/>
read loud!  Or he noticed the McDonald&#39;s &quot;M&quot; and wanted to know if that said<br/>
&quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and we would tell him that is the first letter of McDonald&#39;s,<br/>
etc., etc.<br/>
Also around this age he started playing Playstation.  He knew long before<br/>
this how to put a VCR tape or a computer game in and putting in a CD into<br/>
Playstation was no problem.  BUT, he could not alway tell which game he<br/>
wanted to play if they were all mixed up and out of their cases.  He would<br/>
get frustrated asking someone to come and help him find such and such.  So I<br/>
would hear him putting letters to certain games and then I think he started<br/>
recognizing the titles and doing phoenetic sounding out.  (He knew his<br/>
alphabet, letter recognition and most letter sounds from playing computer<br/>
games, singing ABC with his sister and watching various TV shows.)  After he<br/>
mastered telling games apart and really playing them, he wanted to know<br/>
details of the game.  Like how to get the green sword to work and how much<br/>
bonus points was the little guy worth and what did the pop up screen say<br/>
about saving his score, etc.  So he would have me read these little game<br/>
booklets to him over and over and he started to pick up words.  Now over the<br/>
course of 2 years, he can pretty much read anything.  He is still figuring<br/>
out that &quot;e&quot; on the end doesn&#39;t make a sound and makes one of the letters<br/>
change sounds.  He doesn&#39;t know &quot;vowels&quot; or &quot;rules&quot; but he can figure out<br/>
his Playstation booklets!! I think he was able to do this basically on his<br/>
own because he had a need and he wanted to know these game hints without<br/>
having to wait on me to come and help him.  I believe that when people in<br/>
general have a need they usually try to fulfill it.<br/>
Sorry this is long...just wanted to share another kid&#39;s story of learning to<br/>
read.<br/>

from TV. She loves to be read to, and wants me to points to the words as I read <br/>
them. She pointed a letter B on her shirt last week and said, &quot;That&#39;s a B, a <br/>
B for me!!&quot; (Her name is Brenna) It was kinda a light bulb moment for her. Her <br/>
brother was a very early reader and I hear comments from relatives that he <br/>
was already reading well by her age, etc, etc....which is just crazy. I love <br/>
watching her own personal progress taking its own pace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863743581">I just want to say here, that as a person who once would not let her <br/>

2500 pages in the past 3 months!  I&#39;m not bragging, just saying that <br/>
he was never interested in reading, ALTHOUGH, he was reading from <br/>
games, magazines, etc.  The vocabulary he has picked up and he <br/>
remembers spells and such, it just blows me away.<br/>
<br/>
He used to go to Pensacola Christian Academy and they would have <br/>
these &quot;contests&quot; and the person who read the most pages would win a <br/>
bike or money or something, he never cared enough.  The stories were <br/>
lame, they couldn&#39;t read anything that wasn&#39;t Christian, etc.  In <br/>
his class they had to answer all of these questions on stories that <br/>
someone else thought they should remember and he didn&#39;t do well on <br/>
the comprehension tests...  Forget that!  He is SOOOOO much happier <br/>
now.  It just makes my heart melt.  When he&#39;s bored sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
go to a Harry Potter Quiz site, he scores high on the quizzes.  I <br/>
imagine in public schools there are some pre-set questions and <br/>
probably a book report required for Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
I brought this up to let everyone know how I am that he is home and <br/>
able to enjoy these books, at HIS pace and not in school given &quot;x&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384192536">My &quot;late-reader&quot; Jared, shared something new with me last night;<br/>
Sierra was making up a ticket for the movie we were about to watch.<br/>
She wrote &quot;people&quot; as &quot;pippel&quot; and wanted to know the correct spelling.<br/>
I told her the correct spelling sounded just as funny phonetically;<br/>
Pee-oh-pull. Jared said &quot;I don&#39;t say it that way when I see it, I just<br/>
see it and know it says people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I knew he never learned phonics, I knew he just slowly learned what<br/>
words said....but I hadn&#39;t really thought about it much. I HAD to<br/>
learn to say &quot;Pee-oh-pull&quot; in order to spell it correctly year after<br/>
year. Sierra has learned in more of a phonics style (asking me what<br/>
sounds each letter made and piecing it together over the years) so I<br/>
hadn&#39;t even thought about what it would be like to just see the whole<br/>
word and know.<br/>
<br/>
Just another cool thing that surprised me about the various ways kids<br/>
learn to read naturally. <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that took me by surprise is their reading ability.<br/>
Sierra started to really TRY reading around 5-6. She did what people<br/>
would call &quot;practice&quot;, by sitting with early readers and going over<br/>
and over them until she became proficient enough to read simple words.<br/>
She now reads fluently at age 8.<br/>
Jared otoh, never seemed to be interested in the methodology of<br/>
reading, he simply followed his passions (things like D&D, video games<br/>
and Yu-gi-oh) and as we helped him navigate the words, he picked them up.<br/>
He is a fluent reader now at 12. His ability seemed to grow very<br/>
quickly, where Sierra&#39;s reading journey seemed a slower struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, for the past several years, she would help him<br/>
read. All of the sudden, she is coming to HIM for help. He can read<br/>
more difficult words and read longer paragraphs with more flow.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d worried about his ability a year or two ago and tried pushing,<br/>
who knows what kind of damage I would have done. He has the<br/>
contentedness of knowing he figured it out himself. He never has to<br/>
feel &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;less than&quot; because he learned to read at 12, instead of 6.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t anything my life experiences could have prepared me for.<br/>
But it&#39;s been really cool to watch it unfold.<br/>
<br/>
In that sense, my kids and unschooling ARE a big experiment. I&#39;m so<br/>
glad I get to be the observer!!:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416661601">I was never good at reading comprehension until about 14 or 15 years<br/>
old <br/>
even though I read like crazy and loved books, especially biographies <br/>
from about 5th grade on.  I filled my mind after all with things other <br/>
than the usual school fare, mostly forgettable stuff ... especially if <br/>
questions and tests were attached.<br/>
<br/>
PCA and Harry Potter.  Apparently not a good match.  My SIL and BIL<br/>
went <br/>
to the college version of that school (forget the name?) and they&#39;re <br/>
very much against HP (warning dh not to expose ds to its evils).  I <br/>
would have been all over that when I was coming up and I enjoy the <br/>
movies.  Dh worries about the spell aspect.  I think it&#39;s great<br/>
exercise <br/>
in thinking about how one should use power.  The kids that star in the <br/>
HP series are wonderful to see.  They are growing up so fast and the <br/>
Harry star looks almost 20 to me already.  Very self-assured character <br/>
who realistically struggles with things I would only want to <br/>
vicariously-- brave fellow!  The whole HP atmosphere is fascinating of <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
I love witch/magic/fairy stories and only the last couple of years <br/>
discovered some original Celtic lore which much in that vein sprang <br/>
from.  I fell into those stories after reading Tolkiens Ring books and <br/>
some of the histories connected to the making of.  Another thing...<br/>
very <br/>
uncrunchy of me I suppose-- I love Grimms&#39; Fairy Tales and grew up <br/>
reading every one I could get my hands on.  Only learned later what <br/>
classics they&#39;re supposed to be and now they are most decided NOT pc. <br/>

&gt; He used to go to Pensacola Christian Academy and they would have <br/>
&gt; these &quot;contests&quot; and the person who read the most pages would win a <br/>
&gt; bike or money or something, he never cared enough.  The stories were <br/>
&gt; lame, they couldn&#39;t read anything that wasn&#39;t Christian, etc.  In <br/>
&gt; his class they had to answer all of these questions on stories that <br/>
&gt; someone else thought they should remember and he didn&#39;t do well on <br/>
&gt; the comprehension tests...  Forget that!  He is SOOOOO much happier <br/>
&gt; now.  It just makes my heart melt.  When he&#39;s bored sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; go to a Harry Potter Quiz site, he scores high on the quizzes.  I <br/>
&gt; imagine in public schools there are some pre-set questions and <br/>
&gt; probably a book report required for Harry Potter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I brought this up to let everyone know how I am that he is home and <br/>
&gt; able to enjoy these books, at HIS pace and not in school given &quot;x&quot; <br/>
&gt; amount of days or weeks to read the book and be tested.  <br/>
