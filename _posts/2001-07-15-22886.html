<br/>
I&#39;ll email you privately as soon as I can.  <br/>
<br/>
And Dawn, I will email you too as soon as I&#39;m able.  I have my own business, <br/>
and a five year old.  We&#39;ve unschooled since conception.  And I&#39;m single.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If as a child you were flicked for that, remember your own little self and <br/>
do <br/>
 what you wish your mom had done instead of  hurting you, maybe.<br/>

 who has had all those things happen except the flicking; I was called names <br/>
 instead<br/>

Hot button for me.<br/>
<br/>
   I actually hadn&#39;t thought of someone being rude to her only her observing <br/>
rude behavior. Duh!<br/>
<br/>
   I ran into another HS (gen. classification ;o) ) mom today and breifly <br/>
chatted about summer. Feels like only HSers understand the yuck that come <br/>
from this type of group socialization. I hate it.<br/>
<br/>
   Dh and I were discussing it last night and saying it will take a great <br/>
deal of time to undo this crap. We are so bummed in hindsight that we sent <br/>
her. Live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
    I can tell exactly why she is dishing it out mostly to me. Maybe b/c she <br/>
is most comfortable w/ me or is it b/c I went away for 5 days and she is <br/>
pissed?<br/>
<br/>
   Oh well, take many breaths and teach respect.<br/>

school kid behavior &quot;normal&quot;.<br/>

P.S.  (But, to be fair, I have 7 charming nieces and nephews who went to<br/>
public school and they are all lovely people, so I should cut back on the<br/>
sweeping stereotypes.  One of these days...   &lt;g&gt;)</div>
