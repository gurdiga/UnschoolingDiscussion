<div id="ygrps-yiv-464562369">Hi Erika,<br/>
I too have been struggling with some of the same issues and have been trying <br/>
to &quot;let it go&quot; more often.  My son is 3 1/2 and doesn&#39;t choose to eat many <br/>
fruits or veggies.  It depends.  Sometimes he&#39;ll go for cucumbers, tomatoes, and <br/>
carrots with dip.  He&#39;ll eat pears, apples, and pineapple, sometimes a banana. <br/>
 I&#39;ve tried all the &quot;tricks&quot;...putting veggies on pizza, etc. (he won&#39;t eat <br/>
things unless they are plain so that didn&#39;t work).<br/>
His main meals are toast, bagels, PB, tacos, and pancakes/french toast, <br/>
cheese & yogurt.  That&#39;s about it.  Oh, and he loves sweets like cookies and <br/>
brownies(who doesn&#39;t?).  He used to eat pasta, grilled cheese, chicken, but not <br/>
anymore.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that if I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, he&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s <br/>
hungry.  <br/>
If I let him he would ask for only cookies, etc so I try not to have those in <br/>
the house very often.  If we have them once a week, we eat them until they <br/>
are gone and then it&#39;s not an issue anymore because there aren&#39;t any left.<br/>
I asked his dr about it and she said to give him a daily vitamin and not <br/>
worry about it.<br/>
I think many people with 3-4 yr olds go through this...try not to worry too <br/>
much and just make healthy choices available.  If I fix a snack and start <br/>
eating it he often comes over and starts munching too (yesterday it was an apple <br/>
and rice cakes).<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
