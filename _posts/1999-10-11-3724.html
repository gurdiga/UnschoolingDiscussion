<div id="ygrps-yiv-705067324">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I got caught up!  Whew!  Been a busy week for you guys.  By the<br/>
way please ignore my last post I did not mean to keep the ball rolling when<br/>
it had finally stopped.  Sorry!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  I finally did it!  Those math text books are history (well, they<br/>
kept them in their rooms because they wanted to but I told them they could<br/>
do them if they wanted to or they could box them up or just use them for<br/>
reference tools.)   Eeeeek!  I&#39;m anxious now.  But boy what a load of books<br/>
on math libraries carry - I never knew!  My oldest is still not interested<br/>
in looking at them but I guess that is where I get to trust right?  This is<br/>
hard sometimes.  Oh well, we still enjoy hsing and I&#39;m seeing my dds<br/>
gradually moving toward more and more self directed study - I&#39;m confident<br/>
it will come together with time.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I got lots of math games books like I Hate Mathematics and Mathematics for<br/>
Smarty Pants from the library and read a couple of things to dd who was<br/>
quite surprised that on one hand she may have difficulty in a particular<br/>
segment of math but that in another she is quite good.  Her eyebrows raised<br/>
more than once as I read about 5 pages to her.  I set the books down and to<br/>
date she has ignored them completely!  We did discover the use of our<br/>
Yatzee game once again but she was miffed when she later discovered that<br/>
she had been doing math.  The legos are out in the living room now and they<br/>
have already built houses and barns to go with the Little House on the<br/>
Prairie book we are reading.  Monopoly is the next one (that is a hard one<br/>
for me because they want me to play and  I hate to tie up that much time,<br/>
sigh, guess I&#39;ll have to bite the bullet.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, any ideas on how to help dd (age 10) get back into math in any form<br/>
is very welcomed.  I really want/need to conquer this desire to direct the<br/>
kids learning too much.  How do some of you do it?  Do you simply state I<br/>
want you to work on some math now or do you completely stay out of the<br/>
process?  I&#39;m probably going to be a nuisance on this topic for a while.  :o)<br/>

&gt; Well, any ideas on how to help dd (age 10) get back into math in any form<br/>

&gt; process?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely stay out of it, as far as making any suggestions to work on<br/>
anything in particular.<br/>
<br/>
However, I love math myself.  It is a large part of what I do for fun, so<br/>
they see it all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I recently bought a book that I just love.  It&#39;s written as stories, but<br/>
it&#39;s some of the world&#39;s classic math puzzles.  I know my oldest would love<br/>
it, so I told him that he can read it when I&#39;m done- so naturally, he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to wait and borrowed it sooner.  (&quot;Just don&#39;t lose my<br/>
bookmark!&quot;)  I often share books this way, mention them to whichever kid I<br/>
know would be interested, and offer it when I&#39;m finished.<br/>
<br/>
This book is called &quot;The Man Who Counted: A Collection of Mathematical<br/>
Adventures&quot; and can be found at amazon.com at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393309347/qid=939615786/sr=1-1/002-72612">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393309347/qid=939615786/sr=1-1/002-72612</a><br/>
94-2633032<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend it- and this is the sort of thing I recommend to those<br/>
who want to see the beauty of math.  The best thing about the book is that<br/>
it isn&#39;t all numbers and arithmetic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s probably going to resist anything for awhile that has MATH in <br/>
the title.  Games are great.  We like a book called Family Math <br/>
because it&#39;s full of games.  That&#39;s a good place to start when she&#39;s <br/>
ready to try something,  or maybe you could suggest a game without <br/>
her knowing where the idea came from.  Another thing that doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem like math is logic puzzles and my son loved them before he&#39;d do <br/>
anything else.  There are a lot of games like Monopoly that use math, <br/>
but the kids don&#39;t think of it as a math game.  Also,  does she like <br/>
art - coloring, etc.  What about patterns and tesselations.  That&#39;s <br/>
geometry.  I&#39;ve heard of some people playing War with cards,  but <br/>
laying down two cards and multiplying or adding them before they see <br/>
who wins.  We also have a game called Krypto that you can simplify or <br/>
make harder.  It&#39;s a card came where you try to come up with an <br/>
equation that will equal the objective card - definitely math - no <br/>
sneaking this by - but a lot of fun.<br/>

math whiz in my area and started playing Yatzee with the kids.  DD kept<br/>
asking me what made me decide to play  this game?  I avoided the questions<br/>
for days but one day she overheard me talking to someone on the phone and<br/>
figured out it was the math in it I had used it for.  She looked nearly<br/>
betrayed.  I felt so bad.  But we will continue with chins up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280381927">I too had that problem. I tried everything in the beginning. Needless to<br/>
say, resistance was the norm...followed by tears. 10yo dd was so<br/>
distraught I finally just went searching. First thing, LUCKY ME, I found<br/>
unschooling. Then we decided to let her &quot;pick&quot; her math activities. I<br/>
went to the close-out store and selected math &quot;related&quot; books. Then off<br/>
to our little library and she chose several books there. This was<br/>
earlier in the year....now? Well, some days she will work on math<br/>
subjects all day long. There are<br/>
onlinesites(www.aplusmath.com/www.brainplay.com are two of her favorites<br/>
right now). She has a multiplication/division Dinosaur game from<br/>
Scholastic that she loves to play. We don&#39;t rush and she is allowed to<br/>
use pencil and paper. Other days she will spend less time, however, the<br/>
change has been wonderful. Whenever I run across some math related book<br/>
or game I&#39;ll pick it up and add it to her &quot;pile&quot;. <br/>
     Not to say she does not struggle, but the &quot;struggle&quot; is an image<br/>
building challenge for herself.  She has trouble retaining the<br/>
multiplication, but she will now work it out on her own.  She can&#39;t<br/>
always remember but she knows she can work the problems out. <br/>
     We have the same problem with spelling. However, I don&#39;t worry too<br/>
much as her reading level and retention abilities are excellent. Hope<br/>
this helps!<br/>

&lt;&lt;I guess that is where I get to trust right?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i am with you on this laraine.  our homeschooling consists of all radical <br/>
unschooling except (for my comfort) dd (10yo) is to do writing and math each <br/>
day, period.  meaning she has to write ANYTHING and do ANY sort of math...  <br/>
the unplanned for bonus is the fact that she is good at identifying the <br/>
learning in the everyday!  anyway, many days she doesnt get too creative and <br/>
just does calculadder (where you try to beat your last time on a sheet of <br/>
problems-- she only began to like this when we picked a level that was well <br/>
within her reach, (below where i would have put her!) i dont blame her <br/>
though, she can improve that way-- so its great!)  other days for math she <br/>
does play games.  i have been happy to move into the age of games as this <br/>
year our oldest two children turned 10 and 7 and so can play many games <br/>
together.  monopoly JR they play on their own, so that i dont have to find <br/>
the time to sit.  they play checkers and chess, and we have moneywise kids <br/>
and hive alive (from aristoplay.)  dd also enjoys tangrams and shape blocks <br/>
and riddle type problems when we give them to each other and do them outloud. <br/>
 she bores with writing them, again, i can relate!!!!<br/>
hey, what about playing with money?  in the past, my dd has set up a bank or <br/>
a store for her younger sibs as part of playtime and we have a big jar of <br/>
coins that they play with.  <br/>
<br/>
also, i instruct my dds on attitude.  i explain to them that the deal is that <br/>
it is their responsibility to learn!  i do not formally teach, i answer <br/>
questions when needed but mostly they are doing it.  sometimes i will ask a <br/>
question out loud out of the blue (like, why do i keep money in a bank?)  and <br/>
if there is interest from the one who does not know the answer a discussion <br/>
may ensue...  i guess what i am saying is that i think a big part of her <br/>
getting over math-dislike, is her realizing that no-one is going to be <br/>
shoving it down her throat anymore, ever!  wow!  she has the freedom to <br/>
approach it!  and then, yes the time and trusting may need to hold you over <br/>
til she really believes it is true. <br/>
<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
it is good to me to be on this list bc i am reaffirmed in what i want to do <br/>
with my kids!  i know they are learning but the second someone starts in: <br/>
what curriculum do you use?  or what do you do for history? etc  i get <br/>
uncomfortable.  sometimes i do beautifully in explaining where we are other <br/>
times not.  i am sure you all know what i mean!!  do you all ever get the <br/>
impression that so many people think those unschoolers are doing a bad job?<br/>

    I think it says 8 and up on the package.  I&#39;ve known a number of 4 yos <br/>
who&#39;ve enjoyed it, but mostly tried things at random at that point.  My 6 can <br/>
do all the levels, but she watched others do it a lot first.  Hubby and I <br/>
both like it, played it pretty obsessively for a couple months, and now haul <br/>
it out occasionally.  But, if I had to have 1 and only 1 game for my <br/>
computer, it&#39;s the one I choose.  The first level has fairly easy bits that <br/>
mostly just require matching or following the directions, but it gets harder, <br/>
and the last level is a reasonable challenge for an intelligent adult.  <br/>

ME a couple of years ago LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
As to a sequel, we were at Epcot last week, and in the new Innoventions <br/>
Plaza, where they have all the latest technology, IBM has a display with all <br/>
kinds of new software that&#39;s out...they had several new ones with the <br/>
Fripples in them, similar to the Zoombinis (I had lots of fun with the demos <br/>
at Epcot ;)  There are also new BrainBytes products, which are wonderful (my <br/>
10yo likes them alot, and he HATES anything that sounds like &quot;math&quot;); they&#39;re <br/>
only $9.95, too, which is a really good thing!  If anyone needs any info on <br/>
any of the ones we have, just let me know, and I&#39;ll do what I can :) <br/>
<br/>
Check out www.edmark.com - they have lots of new products out, demos to <br/>
download from the website, a great newsletter, a teacher&#39;s section, etc...  <br/>

software? LOL)<br/>

&lt;&lt; If you&#39;re asking what ages it was designed for, I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t<br/>
 care. :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s a computer game from Broderbund, and I&#39;m thinking maybe I&#39;ve seen it at <br/>

<br/>
OK, got it.<br/>
