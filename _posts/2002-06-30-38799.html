I understand how you felt about a &quot;forced&quot; apology.<br/>
My point isn&#39;t that the child will feel sorry, but rather the recognition of <br/>
what was done wrong, taking ownership (with my help).,,, hopefully learning a <br/>
positive habit that will help in later years.  <br/>
Too many today feel &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; are the worst words to be used, as an <br/>
admitance of &quot;wrong&quot; when they really aren&#39;t &quot;at fault&quot;.<br/>
We need more social skills taught not just when we feel like it.<br/>
My opinion...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder how this ties in with women (maybe some men do this, but I&#39;ve<br/>
only seen women) who now feel they have to apologize and feel sorry for<br/>
*everything* that goes wrong, whether they had anything to do with it or<br/>
not. I catch myself doing this, although less often now that in the past.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a difference between an apologetic &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and a<br/>
sympathetic &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;. Hypothetically speaking, if my kid forgot to<br/>
pack a snack for drama (and didn&#39;t ask for my help in doing it, and had<br/>
been doing it by herself for 2 weeks with no problems) and then came in<br/>
afterwards yelling because I didn&#39;t put a snack in her backpack and she<br/>
was really hungry... I wouldn&#39;t apologize. I might very well say<br/>
something like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you were so hungry, it sounds like a hard<br/>
morning.&quot; but I wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t pack a snack for you&quot;,<br/>
because that would be taking responsibility for a mistake that wasn&#39;t<br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, if I&#39;d been packing the snack all along and had forgotten, I would<br/>
certainly take responsibility and apologize, because I would be at fault.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, we&#39;d probably end up making new plans to ensure that a snack<br/>
was packed, and that would be the most important part.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, the important part is figuring out how to make the &quot;bad&quot; thing not <br/>
happen again.  Sometimes that requires someone taking responsibility for a <br/>
mistake, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
An apology can make a person feel better about what happened, but only if <br/>
it&#39;s sincere.  You can force words, but you can&#39;t force sincerity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Understanding the dynamics of the problem is good but when it must be<br/>
followed by &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and &quot;I accept your apology&quot; (or whatever wording you<br/>
use) you are encouraging them to lie<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s something *way* deeper involved than not having experienced the<br/>
ritual of I&#39;m sorry/I accept your apology. It&#39;s adults modeling searching<br/>
for who was to blame rather than emphasizing the importance of identifying<br/>
the problem and seeking a solution. It&#39;s adults feeling they don&#39;t need to<br/>
say I&#39;m sorry to kids when they&#39;ve done something wrong. And it&#39;s families<br/>
that are disconnected: parents and children spending most of their time<br/>
apart from each other and needing to attend to family maintenance stuff when<br/>
they are together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that discussing what went wrong and modeling the skills I&#39;d like<br/>
my daughter to have to be a lot more effective than training her to act out<br/>
the rituals. Learning that &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; follows something that you&#39;ve done<br/>
wrong is a lesson that takes a second to learn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with this. We have never made our son -31/2 yrs old say<br/>
sorry - but what we do do is tell him we are sorry if we are in the wrong or<br/>
if we haved placed him in a situation that he couldn&#39;t cope with - ie/ mummy<br/>
and daddy are sorry for taking you out when you are tired and don&#39;t want to<br/>
stay seated in the car seat for so long etc. What we have found now is that<br/>
he will say sorry to his 21month old sister if he accidently knocks her down<br/>
during play etc but if  lashes out at her for what ever reason we will tell<br/>
him something like &quot;If your sister upsets or hits you tell her to stop and<br/>
be gentle or come and get mummy or daddy to help you, we need to be gentle<br/>
with each other and we need to apologise for hurting each other when you are<br/>
ready&quot; We will leave it at that - and off course speak to our dd but what we<br/>
have found is that at these times our ds will say stop Josie, be gentle or<br/>
else he will come and get us. If  he does lash out at times (and there are<br/>
still lots of times of these as well) we find that after he has cooled down,<br/>
and on his own initiative he will be loving towards his sister and give her<br/>
a hug and a kiss - no sorry mentioned but I figured action speak louder than<br/>
words.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am in agreement with Sue, and other posters, about forced <br/>
apologies. I do want my children to have empathy and compassion, but <br/>
not at the expense of being insincere or untruthful.<br/>
<br/>
My mother used to make my little brother and I kiss and make up if we <br/>
fought with each other. Well, there were times I would rather have <br/>
punched him one than kissed and made up!  <br/>
<br/>
On a semi-related note, Will, who&#39;s 20 months old (today!) just <br/>
learned the word sorry (pronounced saw-vee). And he says it all the <br/>
time, but his understanding of the word is a bit different than <br/>
ours ... he says saw-vee when he feels ***someone else*** should be <br/>
sorry for something. Like yesterday when I accidentally touched his <br/>
leg with the hot buckle from the car seat. &quot;Ouch! Saw-vee! Saw-vee!&quot;, <br/>
he said. He was right, I was saw-vee!!!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that when you&#39;re FORCED to use those words with no meaning behind <br/>
them , you can certainly begin to feel that they ARE the worst words to be <br/>
used---that they ARE an admittance of wrong-doing or guilt. That&#39;s EXACTLY <br/>
what you&#39;ll get by forcing an apology---adults that say it without meaning <br/>
it. Or they&#39;ll avoid it altogether. If you&#39;re NOT at fault, but are made to <br/>
apologize anyway because an adult told you to...what do you expect?<br/>
<br/>
Big problem with that last statement. That the social &quot;skill&quot; would be more <br/>
important to you than how the child ACTUALLY feels says a lot. Better to say <br/>
nothing and get over it in your own time. I&#39;ve watched many children SAY &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sorry&quot;, not mean it (lie), and go right back to being creeps. I&#39;d rather see <br/>
a child say NOTHING, think about the friendship, and FEEL sorry---or <br/>
not---than to lie to make a teacher/parent feel that the child is learning a <br/>
social skill.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize regularly to the boys if we&#39;ve wronged them. They do the same <br/>
for us. The boys have never been forced to apologize, but they MEAN it when <br/>
they say it. They&#39;re not lying to satisfy me or their dad---or to develop a <br/>
social skill. They apologize because, in their hearts, they&#39;re sorry.<br/>

&lt;&lt; This is something I&#39;ve been pondering cos someone told me I should &#39;make&#39; <br/>
my kids apologise even when they don&#39;t mean it. Which I found silly. The <br/>
adult they are apologising tooo knows they don&#39;t mean<br/>
it and the child feels resentful saying words when they don&#39;t feel sorry. <br/>
It&#39;s all pretend.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well there&#39;s something homeschooled kids would learn if they were at school.  <br/>
How to manage a forced apology.<br/>
<br/>
They can take the following forms:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you got mad.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you were in the way when I threw that.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t just graze you.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m *SORRY*&quot;  (said in the tone of voice that indicates they mean to say &quot;I <br/>
HATE you!!!!!&quot;)<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I got caught.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That last one is only for the bravest of kids in school offices, but I&#39;ve <br/>
heard it.  And technically, it&#39;s &quot;sorry.&quot;<br/>
