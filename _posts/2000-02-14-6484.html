&gt;<br/>
&gt; An article in National Geographic several years ago provided penetrating<br/>
&gt; pictures of God&#39;s wings.&nbsp. After a forest  fire in Yellowstone<br/>
National<br/>
&gt; Park, Forest Rangers began their trek up a  mountain to assess the<br/>
&gt; inferno&#39;s damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One ranger found a bird  literally petrified in ashes perched statuesquely<br/>
&gt; on the ground at the base of a tree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with  a<br/>
&gt; stick. When he gently struck it, three tiny chicks scurried from under<br/>
&gt; their dead  mother&#39;s wings. The loving mother, keenly aware of impending<br/>
&gt; disaster, had carried her offspring to the base of the tree and had<br/>
&gt; gathered them under<br/>
&gt; her wings, instinctively knowing that the toxic  smoke would rise. She<br/>
&gt; could have flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When the blaze had arrived and the heat had  scorched her small body, the<br/>
&gt; mother had remained steadfast. Because she  had been willing to die, those<br/>
&gt; under the cover her wings would live. &quot;He will cover you with his<br/>
feathers,<br/>
&gt; and under his wings you will find  refuge.&quot; (Psalm  91:4).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Being loved this much should make a difference in your  life. Remember the<br/>
&gt; One who loves you and then be different because of it. A Thought: Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; travel faster than your Guardian Angel can fly. I leave you in the arms of<br/>
&gt; Jesus,  Psalm 139,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
