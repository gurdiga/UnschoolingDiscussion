<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Brynn, We did speak via e-mail a while back, and 
we were gonna meet at a park, but after I got my computer back up I coulnd&#39;t 
seem to reach you.....still have those tomatoes?, would love to see your garden 
still......and actually, if you wanna....we&#39;re having Zain&#39;s Birthday party next 
month on JUly 15, (he&#39;ll be 5)a Saturday.....we&#39;ll be having a Potluck(for the 
folks), and a magician for the kids....nothing formal, just for fun...if you&#39;re 
not busy you&#39;re welcome to come...we will have kids of all ages from babies to 
teenagers, most kids will be in between though.....maybe your family can make 
it.......Many Blessings.......Michelle&nbsp; (P.S....if you do come, and you 
still have those tomato plants, which are probably pretty big by now....I could 
use one or two....my tomatoes didn&#39;t come up this year.....I think it was my 
methods...they wanted to be babied...ya know)w/b</font></div></span></blockquote></html>
