<div id="ygrps-yiv-1984569346">Eileen,<br/>
<br/>
I for one have had my eyes opened WIDE by your posts. For the first <br/>
time in 21 years I admit that there can indeed be a reason to swat a <br/>
child. I think this list needs you and your opinions more than you <br/>
realize. I apologize for anything I said that sounded like an attack <br/>
on you. Please stick around and see how much good you&#39;ve done by <br/>
taking the time to &#39;set us straight.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>
