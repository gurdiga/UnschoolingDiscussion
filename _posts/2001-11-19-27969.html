Ouch.  This is what I&#39;m looking forward to as well.  <br/>
I usually end up insulting someone and it seems to bother me less and<br/>
less as the years go by.  <br/>
I often let my son himself handle these things.  When uncle Carl ( the<br/>
Nazi ) said<br/>
- what are you going to do when he has to learn about algorithms- - <br/>
Dylan piped up  --Oh, Everybody knows that guy can&#39;t dance! ... ( sorry<br/>

You have a right to defend yourself.  You don&#39;t have to feel bad about<br/>
it.  <br/>
Sometimes a loud &quot; Why do you persist in being so rude?&quot;   quiets things<br/>
right down.  ( or poison?)  <br/>

from a computer game.  He sort of, kind of understood it but he could <br/>
spout it off flawlessly.  HE shut down tons of adult criticism with <br/>
it. <br/>

So, if your kids are learning something way above where they &quot;should <br/>
be&quot; how about doing a little proactive bragging.  Hit the nosy <br/>
relatives with a big gushy commentary on what they are doing these <br/>
days!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952717558">Lol!  One of my father in law&#39;s concerns is that they&#39;ll learn <br/>
