<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137682997">Kirby left me a note, on paper, last night.  I wish I could just scan it in. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s printed, obviously by someone without much experience printing.<br/>
<br/>
It says <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hiya Mom!<br/>
<br/>
Eric decided to stay again [the &#39;g&#39; almost illegible, no tail on it; the a <br/>
funky like a &quot;d&quot; almost) so dont be shockeD when you see him!  (a smiley face <br/>
drawn)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Then followed a note from Eric, who&#39;s older and goes to school.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank You For um, not getting mad!<br/>
   --Eric (and a smiley face drawn)<br/>
<br/>
Eric&#39;s letters were way better, but his g&#39;s were as bad as Kirby&#39;s, and he <br/>
capitalized just about everything.<br/>
<br/>
Worth analyzing?  Sometimes a snapshot of a real-life use is helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby spelled everything correctly (once I figured out &quot;again&quot;).  Kirby is <br/>
making his a like a type-set a, with a line up top, because he learned to <br/>
read and write and spell from typeset and computer stuff, and that kind of a <br/>
is common.<br/>

concerned? We really didn&#39;t spend lots of time on writing practice last <br/>
year--I let her do lots of art, which she loves, instead, to help develop her <br/>
fine motor skills. Writing even a sentence properly is a major challenge, <br/>
between backward letters, spacing, spelling, and letters beginning at the <br/>
bottom. Certainly a case of asynchrenistic development when compared to her <br/>
reading skills!<br/>

&gt;&gt;has done they say &quot;this is nice - but how come your J&#39;s are backward?&quot; It <br/>

her with a snappy comeback. Or maybe she&#39;s so self-assured that she knows <br/>
enough to ignore such somments. ;-) It might be helpful for you to know <br/>
which camp she&#39;s in though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She reads very, very well - and people- including dh seem to think that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>seem too concerned about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reading and writing are two completely different skills. They may complement <br/>
each other, but they don&#39;t necessarily come at the same time. Casey started <br/>
writing when she was 3, but she was not an early reader. I think Sandra <br/>
pointed out something similar with Holly writing before reading fluently. My <br/>
son is the opposite. He has been reading fluently well before the writing <br/>
kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when Casey cares about the &quot;look&quot; of her written product, <br/>
and times when she just cares about the content. Sounds like your daughter <br/>
is thinking along the same lines. Right now content is what she&#39;s after. <br/>
When it matters, she&#39;ll spruce up the &quot;look&quot; of her writing and pay more <br/>
attention to those pesky details like letter direction. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;In any case, it was nice to read about someone else who does the same <br/>
&gt;&gt;thing!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOTS of kids do the same thing. It&#39;s just that most of them are in school <br/>
getting shamed or labelled or turned off to independent writing completely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343482140">I took freshman english in college 2 times.  The first time was with a <br/>
very precise assignment oriented professor.  I failed miserably.  The <br/>
second time I took it with a really laid back lady who encouraged us to <br/>
just start writing, skip words, rewrite words over when we got stuck on <br/>
a thought, don&#39;t bother scratching out mistakes - she called it free <br/>
writing.  We would then take that first draft and put it into more <br/>
organized form.  I find now that I do best when I start this way too.<br/>

Freewriting is the centerpiece of what I teach. :)<br/>
<br/>
Peter Elbow popularized the term in his famous work Writing <br/>
with Power and most colleges now teach it (The Allyn and Bacon <br/>
Guide to Writing comes to mind). It&#39;s kind of obvious to anyone <br/>
who writes naturally that you can&#39;t edit your thoughts when you sit <br/>
down to write. Anything you get on paper can later be crafted and <br/>
tweaked. But the funny thing is, non-writers don&#39;t know this. So <br/>
they have to be let in on the big secret: Psst. Get it all out, even <br/>
the stuff that seems unrelated. Then later go back and cut and <br/>
paste until you like it.<br/>
