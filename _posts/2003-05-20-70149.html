<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are working towards this, but how?  I know it is a vauge question <br/>
&gt; but I am having trouble wording it.  How do you handle it when they <br/>
&gt; do something *wrong*, both if you find out and if they tell you <br/>
&gt; themselves?  How do you create that trust to *insure* they do come to <br/>
&gt; you?  Right now, my ds, 4, is pretty open but I want to maintain that <br/>
&gt; as he gets older (right now it is that mommy I love you stage and <br/>
&gt; mommy is all good stage&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said, my boys are 8 and 6 so I might not be the best person to answer <br/>
that.  It is a process of trust.  I have always trusted that my boys were <br/>
doing the best they could.  Meaning that they were not out to get in trouble. <br/>
 They didn&#39;t spill their juice on purpose.  They come to me and say &quot;Mom I <br/>
spilled my juice on the rug.&quot;  I say &quot;OK do you need help cleaning it up?&quot;  <br/>
Then they either say no and go get a towel or they say yes and we clean it up <br/>
together.  There is no punishment.  I don&#39;t scream at them for spilling the <br/>
juice.  And they have just always come to me. I am hoping that by doing these <br/>
little things now that when the challenges are larger they will continue to <br/>
come to me.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to help whenever asked.  Even if I think they can do it <br/>
themselves.  If my oldest asks me to make him a peanut butter sandwich, <br/>
unless there is some reason that I can&#39;t, I will say yes.  I don&#39;t say can&#39;t <br/>
you do it yourself, even though I know he can.  I just assume that there is a <br/>
reason that he wants his Mom to make it for him.  Not that he is lazy or <br/>
trying to take advantage of me.  I guess I am trying to build a relationship <br/>
of trust that will carry us through a lifetime, not just a set of rules for <br/>
now.<br/>
Hope that makes some sense.<br/>

There is  a really good book called the Parent/Teen Breakthrough - a <br/>
Relationship Approach. (Or something close enough so that you&#39;d be able <br/>
to find it based on that). I recommend it to parents of young kids, not <br/>
just teens, because you can start building that great relationship from <br/>
the start!<br/>
