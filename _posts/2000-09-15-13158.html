&gt;I am so glad someone else doesn&#39;t push the age thing with their kids.  I thought maybe I was the only one who didn&#39;t teach my child his age, or how to &#39;high-five&#39;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My eldest knows his full name, as well as mine and my husband&#39;s.  SO that is all he needs for now if he gets lost.  Why on earth would his age be &quot;Vital&quot; information that he would need to know?  He doesn&#39;t care, and when people ask him and he does not answer, I do it for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if he ever gets lost and they need to call his name and age over a loudspeaker or some such, I would hope that the adults he is is the custody of are intelligent enough to hazard a reasonable guess.  I can&#39;t think of any other time when he would &quot;need&quot; to know.  He doesn&#39;t even count yet.<br/>
