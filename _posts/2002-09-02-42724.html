<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Family matters : why homeschooling makes sense by David Guterson is the one<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard recommended most often for reluctant husbands.  Guterson is a<br/>
&gt; high school teacher (or was - he&#39;s an novelist as well).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always been curious if he continued teaching high school after his<br/>
novel &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;.  It was so successful, and in &quot;Family<br/>
Matters&quot; I had the impression that while he enjoyed teaching school, that it<br/>
was also frustrating (gee, imagine that!).  Anybody know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed both his books very much, and Family Matters helped sell a<br/>
friend&#39;s husband on homeschooling this year.  I saw another one on the<br/>
english language rack at the train station, but I need to order it off<br/>
Amazon.com -- $17 for a paperback, yikes!<br/>
