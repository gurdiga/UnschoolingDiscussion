<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957058665">&lt;&lt;I wonder if thats part of why its banned in Texas&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The other part being we (Texas) is chock full of nuts who will not be happy<br/>
until the entire world looks, acts and thinks exactly the way they do.  Our<br/>
&quot;Christian&quot; hs group has its own Girl Scout troop.  They are switching to<br/>
&quot;American Heritage Girls&quot; (whatever that is) because Girl Scouts are too<br/>
liberal!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was sent the Onion article by a concerned parent in our former group and<br/>
eventually asked to leave the group because the kids and I love Harry.<br/>
Other homeschoolers I know feel a need to hide the fact they read certain<br/>
books, watch certain shows, play with certain toys.  Its really sad.  I<br/>
wonder what the reaction would be if people knew my 10yo dd just bought a<br/>
book of spells.<br/>

called.  No such item around these parts I&#39;ll bet.  <br/>
I bet you can guess the reaction!  If she was in ps she&#39;d probably be<br/>
expelled.  ( or ex spelled ) <br/>

told, &quot;We don&#39;t do that here.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137338697">Ya know, I look back to when my oldest were in ps (wish I didn&#39;t have that<br/>
to look back on but we live and we learn ~~sigh~~) and think what would<br/>
happen now if eldest daughter did now what she did then.<br/>
<br/>
We lived on 50 acres, raised and showed horses, sheep, cattle and goats.  We<br/>
raised rabbits and chickens and generally were self sufficient.  We owned<br/>
our own butcher shop.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, the kidlets were well aware of all the facts of life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Little boy told eldest daughter that children were either brought by a stork<br/>
or found in a cabbage patch or someother such nonsense.  Boy did she<br/>
straighten him out in a hot tick &lt;g&gt;  something about it takes a mommy and a<br/>
daddy and a bucnh of days later the mommy has labor and then out squirts the<br/>
baby.<br/>
<br/>
the teacher came unhinged, the little boy&#39;s parents came unhinged and the<br/>
school threated to expel her!  Geez, now I bet they would!<br/>

California plates &lt;g&gt;  Which I did only once &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m a fast learner &lt;g&gt;<br/>
After that I stuck with our Jimmy with the Arizona plates and made sure I<br/>
always had a horse trailer behind me!<br/>
