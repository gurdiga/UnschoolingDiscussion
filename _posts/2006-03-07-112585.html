<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845883127">We had a technical glitch and quite a few people were unable to complete  <br/>
their registrations for the Northeast Unschooling Conference by the Early Bird  <br/>
deadline. Therefore, I&#39;m extending the deadline to March 13th. <br/>
 <br/>
If you know anybody who would enjoy the conference, please pass along the  <br/>
information. In addition to our amazing presenters, we have many of our friends  <br/>
coming. It&#39;s shaping up to be a fun conference.  <br/>
<br/>
Kathryn Baptista, Conference Coordinator<br/>
 <br/>
Come to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference, Memorial Day Weekend, May <br/>
26-28, 2006 in  Peabody, Massachusetts!  www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com<br/>
