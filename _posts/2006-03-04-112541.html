<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538576867">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My son has been making &quot;claymation&quot; type movies using an old 8mm camera and Pinnacle studio software.  Our camera has finally died. (It lasted longer than I expected.)  If anyone has any camera/movie experience and would be willing to dialog off-list and help him decide where to go from here, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
