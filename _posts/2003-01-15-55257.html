&gt; &gt; I can relate to this. Heather is tall and skinny. Trousers (pants that are<br/>
&gt; the right length just slide right down, and if we get them so they fit her<br/>
&gt; waist, they are flapping 3 inches above her ankles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, I can so relate to this, too. That is how I was when I was growing up.<br/>
&gt; My mom could never find pants that fit me in the store (always too short) so<br/>
&gt; she made most of my clothes, especially pants, for years. She said when I<br/>
&gt; was about 8-12 years old, she used the same size pattern for me every year<br/>
&gt; but just made the legs longer each time. Maybe you could try that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Mind you, no huge loss. I hate sewing plus I can now take tea-bags out of cups with my fingers cos I can&#39;t feel anything :-)<br/>

Well, I was just kidding about the sewing, sort of. Pants with zippers and<br/>
pockets are about the worst things to sew - very complicated. Much easier to<br/>
buy - if you can just find the right size. I have a lot of luck for myself<br/>
buying at Ross - they usually have pants that fit for a great price, too!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, sorry to hear about your MS. That must be tough to deal with. Have you<br/>
seen the movie Lorenzo&#39;s Oil with Nick Nolte in it? Excellent movie! It&#39;s a<br/>
true story about a boy who was diagnosed with an MS-type of disease. I<br/>
remember really liking it, although I cried a few times! Even my boys liked<br/>
it and were glued to the set while it was on. Don&#39;t worry - it has a good<br/>
ending. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
