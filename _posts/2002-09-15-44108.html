 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t stand coffee. Can&#39;t stand the smell or color of it. Makes me gag. <br/>
Literally. Same for tira mi su, cappucino desserts, and anything &quot;mocca&quot;!  I <br/>
flatly refuse to drink milk. Can&#39;t stand the smell or texture or taste. When <br/>
I rarely eat cereal, it&#39;s dry.<br/>
Eggs. &lt;shivers&gt; Don&#39;t get me started!<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, my husband will have the occasional expresso or cappucino when we dine <br/>
out (but I refuse to kiss him afterwards), and my six year old LOVES coffee <br/>
(again, NO kissing!). I don&#39;t even want them breathing in my general <br/>
direction! All three men-in-my-life will drink a glass of milk with sweets <br/>
(yech!) or with tortilla chips (!) and on cereal. We go through 1.5 gallons <br/>
of milk/week. I don&#39;t drink a drop. All three are egg-crazy. Fried, <br/>
scrambled, boiled, poached, omeletted, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
Why would I deny them these things because I hate them?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Does this make since?  I&#39;d really like to know if someone feels this is<br/>
not an unschooling approach and why.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Not to me. Do they get to choose, or have you already made the choice FOR <br/>
them?<br/>
