&gt; I decided to bake bread & pies for tomorrow.  (DH has a really great key<br/>
&gt; lime pie.)  I was letting the kids (7 & 4) help but they were into it more<br/>
&gt; than I needed.  First we made the graham cracker crust (DH wanted to buy the<br/>
&gt; premade).  They had a blast.  DH was surprised to see them having so much<br/>
&gt; fun.  DH was busy getting the chicken in marinate & the kids were under foot<br/>
&gt; trying to help him too.  They had to read & follow directions for me.  I was<br/>
&gt; planning on one key lime & one pumpkin.  DD & I cooked some down from last<br/>
&gt; year&#39;s pumpkin & I froze it in cup sizes.  DH decided pumpkin was not in<br/>
&gt; season so we&#39;re having 2 key lime pies.  Then I got out the bread dough.<br/>
&gt; The kids were surprised at how it grew.  They wanted to eat the dough more<br/>
&gt; than knead.  The first loaf is out of the oven & smells great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DH decided he&#39;s figured out why husbands go to work & stay out of the<br/>
&gt; homeschooling way.  The kids were trying to be too much help for him in a<br/>
&gt; small kitchen.  Though he&#39;s gradually getting used to it.  It&#39;s the first<br/>
&gt; time he&#39;s been home for a major bake off.<br/>
