<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875849937">&lt;&lt; have you tried Cranial Sacral therapy? Has worked<br/>
wonders for me. If I went regularly it would be<br/>
helping much more then I&#39;d only need tune ups.<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if this is the same thing as Cranial<br/>
Osteopathy (I&#39;m from the UK and tried this)? At the<br/>
moment I&#39;m single parenting with no financial<br/>
assistance (from her dad) so seeing anyone is out of<br/>
the question. But who knows what the future will<br/>
bring! I&#39;ll look into it when I&#39;m better off<br/>
financially!<br/>
