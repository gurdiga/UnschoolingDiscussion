<h4>The White&#39;s</h4>
<p><small><time>20 Sep 1999, at  8:33pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814394505">Hi all, coming out of lurkdom on the issue of late nights & trying to have<br/>
some time for yourself & your partner/husband.  What a concept!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Cindy White, we live in a very rural area of SW Virginia.  We&#39;ve<br/>
only lived here about 2 1/2 years, having moved here from small town north<br/>
of Charlotte (grew up in Charlotte, so rural life takes some getting use<br/>
to!).  We have 2 children, Dillon is 6 and Emma has just turned 3.<br/>
<br/>
We have always known we would homeschool. We believe in attachment parenting<br/>
and child-led learning (especially for developmental issues like weaning and<br/>
potty training), so we naturally fell into an unschool philosophy of<br/>
education.  The unschool thing has been a big hurdle for me where we<br/>
live...I am the only one, and there is only one other family here who does<br/>
not homeschool for religious reasons.<br/>
<br/>
When Dillon was young I was able to do shift work as a customer svc rep for<br/>
the power company, working 3 12&#39;s on the weekends while my husband went to<br/>
school full time.  That way we were able to keep Dillon out of daycare.  My<br/>
dh & I were like 2 ships passing in the night.  I only had to work (same<br/>
shift) after maternity leave with Emma about 3 months before dh gets current<br/>
job & I am able to stay at home full time.  That was when we moved here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank God I have a WONDERFUL husband.  When Dillon was small I found out<br/>
very quickly how easy it is to lose yourself.  Then you feel VERY guilty<br/>
because you feel you are neglecting your husband & your marriage.  But my<br/>
husband always understood & has always encouraged me.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, manytimes, your are just all touched out.  It&#39;s not that you<br/>
don&#39;t want to &quot;snuggle&quot;, it&#39;s just that you&#39;ve been snuggling all day with<br/>
someone else (your children) & it&#39;s hard to want more, even a different<br/>
kind.  This is mostly when they are babies.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in our family, we are just SO busy.  You all know what my schedule is<br/>
like with swim classes, playgroups, grocery & other errands, housework &<br/>
laundry, etc.  I don&#39;t have to paint that picture for you!  Shortly after<br/>
beginning his new job & moving here my dh began working towards his MBA at<br/>
Wake Forest.  Well....MBA, married but alone?  Works all day, drives over 1<br/>
hr (one way) twice a week, usually more often due to group projects for<br/>
school.  When he is at home he is studying.<br/>
<br/>
We are all very greedy with our time, if he has any free time, because there<br/>
is so little of it.  My dh & I have to work extra hard at finding time<br/>
together, weekend mornings sometimes are good as we can find something to<br/>
distract the kids for a little while!  We don&#39;t have a babysitter, don&#39;t<br/>
really know anyone, but mainly because Dillon is diabetic.  Emma doesn&#39;t<br/>
like anyone else, anyway. So........<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is an answer to this question except to work harder at<br/>
making it work...just like the homeschool thing.  I&#39;m sure some families<br/>
suffer more than others during periods like this due to personality issues,<br/>
but luckily my family is doing fine.  My dh makes an extra effort to make<br/>
time for me to be alone, even if it&#39;s just going to Walmart alone.  I also<br/>
make an effort to give him time he needs...sometimes just some daily cave<br/>
time, other times he gets to go by himself to bluegrass festivals or<br/>
canoeing/camping.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point I&#39;m trying to make in this long post is, don&#39;t give up.<br/>
This is what all good marriages go thru, at least the ones with children.<br/>
All of us as homeschoolers have already chosen the harder but more rewarding<br/>
path for our families.  By harder I mean we don&#39;t take the fast & easy<br/>
way...we don&#39;t look forward to the day we can send our kids to school or to<br/>
the kids bedtime, so we will be rid of them for a while.  We all chose to be<br/>
with our kids because we like them, we like being with them.  And because of<br/>
that we have to occasionally work harder at the other things.  It&#39;ll all be<br/>
over so soon, the kids will be grown & gone & we&#39;ll have plenty of time to<br/>
keep house & snuggle.<br/>
<br/>
I do think you need to keep talking about it...mainly because of the<br/>
female/male, venus/mars way of communicating.  My husband needs me to be<br/>
direct with him, I need him to be subtle with me....I suspect that&#39;s a<br/>
gender thing.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is sooooo long....this has been an ongoing thing for us, since<br/>
children, and is just part of marriage.  And thanks, to all of you, who<br/>
support my unschooling choices.<br/>
<br/>

Who rationalizes not doing housework by saying:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to BE dirt one day, why fight it now!&quot;</div>

     Your post was very good, and I really didn&#39;t think it was too long at <br/>
all.  You brought up alot of very good issues, so it was very interesting.  I <br/>
am glad that you took the time to write about it all.<br/>
     My husband has always been very wonderful also.  We have been married <br/>
for 19 years, and he has been very supportive in my staying at home, the <br/>
attachment parenting issues (except that he encouraged them to try to make it <br/>
through the night in their own room after they turned 2.  If they woke up and <br/>
joined us later, that was ok), and even homeschooling.  He was much more laid <br/>
back about discipline when they were small (we never even heard of attachment <br/>
parenting when our children were small.  We had them sleep with us, I nursed <br/>
and cuddled, we kept them with us almost constantly, and we didn&#39;t use <br/>
babysitters----because that is what our instincts had us to do.  We only <br/>
learned many years later that there was a term for it, and not only that, but <br/>
that there was alot more to it.  By then our youngest was already 5 years <br/>
old.  I wished I had heard and read some of the books by Sears way back when <br/>
my oldest was born!)  Anyway, I was raised by very, very strict parents who <br/>
believed in yelling and spanking.  Unfortunately, I was encouraged by my <br/>
family and friends to do the same thing with my kids.  It was always my <br/>
husband who would say &quot;Now Tami, they are just being kids.  Calm down and <br/>
quit being so upset.  That is why I don&#39;t understand the change that has come <br/>
over him in the last year.  Now HE is the one yelling all the time.  He yells <br/>
at me and the kids.  I have tried to find out if something is bothering him, <br/>
and he just says that it is the way we are all living.  He can&#39;t stand us <br/>
sleeping late or staying up late.  He is also bothered by the fact that the <br/>
17 year old hasn&#39;t made &quot;big plans&quot; for his future.  He says that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
agree with this &quot;attachment parenting&quot; and &quot;gentle discipline&quot; crap, that <br/>
what these kids need are a good shaking up and a spanking.  He says that they <br/>
don&#39;t mind unless he screams at them.  The thing is that the kids are NOT <br/>
being bad at all.  They don&#39;t usually smart off (unless he screams and yells <br/>
and goads them into it).  They are very well behaved kids, and other people <br/>
are always complimenting me on their behavior.  I just don&#39;t understand the <br/>
change in him at all.  I am wondering if it is because they are all older <br/>
now?  The youngest will be 8 in just a few weeks, one just turned 11, one <br/>
will be 14 in December, and the oldest will turn 18 in February.<br/>
     We have had struggles over the unschooling.  Our oldest was in public <br/>
school until he turned 13.  We started homeschooling in 8th grade, and we <br/>
started off using KONOS.  It didn&#39;t take long, until I realized just How much <br/>
public school had damaged him (there had been two cases of verbal and mental <br/>
abuse by teachers that my son had endured for a year, that I had no idea was <br/>
going on).  Both of us were burned out, and I just happened to stumble across <br/>
some books by John Holt and then later Grace Llewellyn.  That was like a door <br/>
opening and letting sunshine into our lives!!!  I think all four of my kids <br/>
have thrived by unschooling, but my husband is very, very worried (and so our <br/>
my parents, and I have to admit that at times, they can even get me worried <br/>
when they keep going on and on about it) because my 17 year old doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to have ANYTHING to do with anything that even resembles school.<br/>
My dh thinks it is because I am not &quot;forcing&quot; him to do Algebra, English, <br/>
Biology etc.<br/>
I think it is because he got burned out by public school, and that he will do <br/>
those subjects if he decides he need them for something.  The only problem <br/>
is, that my son has no idea what he wants.  In a big way, I understand.  <br/>
Heck, I had no idea what I wanted to do when I graduated either, and I went <br/>
to public school!  My son only knows that he loves anything to do with Star <br/>
Wars and Star Trek (or other Science Fiction or Fantasy, but those two are <br/>
his favorite) and he loves playing Nintendo 64 and getting on the internet.  <br/>
My husband says this is not enough, and he is pushing him for more!  Right <br/>
now, my son is working for his Eagle award for Boy Scouts and is very <br/>
involved in our church.  He really says that he would LOVE being a youth <br/>
minister.  However, I have told him that this involves college, and that he <br/>
would probably need to prepare if that is the case, and he ISN&quot;T motivated at <br/>
all.  As a matter of fact, he still hasn&#39;t studied for the written test to <br/>
get his drivers permit, and look how long he has had for that!  He wants his <br/>
drivers license, he just doesn&#39;t want to have to WORK for it.  So maybe there <br/>
is some truth in what my husband says?  Maybe I am not pushing enough?  I do <br/>
get very confused.  I truly believe in unschooling, but it has been over 4 <br/>
years since he got out of public school and he is still not motivated to do <br/>
anything!<br/>
     Oh well, this all came about, because I am very, very confused about the <br/>
change in attitude from my husband.  I have even wondered if he has some type <br/>
of illness that is causing these changes in him (I know that some types of <br/>
cancers or debilitating illnesses can also cause mood changes).  I am really <br/>
at wits end and very worried about our marriage.  I don&#39;t understand this, <br/>
and I don&#39;t want to give up unschooling my kids, or give up my ideals of how <br/>
to bring up my children (no spanking or forcing), because all of a sudden my <br/>
husband has done a complete turn around!  I am confused, desperate, and <br/>
praying for answers!<br/>

You are right, this really does sound like a substantial personality change <br/>
on the part of your husband.  Is he experiencing a lot of stress?  Otherwise, <br/>
it could be depression.  (It could be both stress and depression.)  <br/>
Depression doesn&#39;t make everyone apathetic, it makes some people extremely <br/>
grouchy.  <br/>
<br/>
I try, but don&#39;t always succeed, to remember that when someone is acting <br/>
unlovable, it probably means they need *more* love and consideration.  <br/>
Sometimes we parents, DADS as well as moms, sacrifice so much of our energy, <br/>
time and peace that we obliterate our own selves.  Now that your children are <br/>
past the needy baby and toddler age, it might mean a lot to your spouse if <br/>
his needs, wishes and preferences were made as important (maybe temporarily <br/>
more important) than those of the kids.  I only say this because I think I <br/>
have gone too far in this direction.  Our life revolves so much around my son <br/>
and his illness that my husband&#39;s needs get almost completely ignored.  But, <br/>
it would help me a lot if my husband would *speak up more* and *have some <br/>
ideas* about what would make him happy.  It certainly stinks when dad is <br/>
unhappy and thinks fairness means everyone else should be unhappy, too.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

     You know, this idea has occurred to me and my husband.  We joked about <br/>
the idea that if he took one of those tests right now (you know, where they <br/>
rate all the stressful things that have happened to you in one year, to see <br/>
how you would rate on being stressed out?), that he would probably be at the <br/>
top of the chart.  <br/>
     Lets see, he changed jobs (after 17 yrs), we moved to a new home (after <br/>
9 years), his grandmother died, something very major happened to our minister <br/>
at church (he had been there 18 years), my dad had a cancerous tumor removed, <br/>
I started a new in-home business, a close friend (whose husband left her for <br/>
another woman over a year ago) had to go back to work so we now have her two <br/>
children for a major part of the time, another close friend left her husband <br/>
and child for a man she met over the internet, we bought a brand new van (big <br/>
purchase---also this computer  :)---that could be stressful too) and I could <br/>
go on and on.  No wonder he is stressed out!  We all should be!   I think we <br/>
all need some down time, and he and I could use some alone time!  :)<br/>
