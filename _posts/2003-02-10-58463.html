<div id="ygrps-yiv-133935744">We&#39;ve got a pretty decent microscope that was given to us.  It was a high<br/>
school one at one time.  My granddaughter (8) sounded interested when I<br/>
asked if she&#39;d like to mess around with it the next time she comes.  Anybody<br/>
have any ideas for neat stuff to look at?  I never got it out much with<br/>
Lars.  He didn&#39;t sound interested, and I didn&#39;t know of any neat stuff that<br/>
might have sparked his interest.  I&#39;ve already thought of hair, skin<br/>
scrapings, saliva, and blood.  (I&#39;ll prick my finger for a good cause.)<br/>
What I learned about microscopes in school has been completely forgotten.  I<br/>
don&#39;t remember when and why you need to put a cover on a slide and that sort<br/>
of thing.  Can anybody point me to some useful advice?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your granddaughter is interested in the microscope, she&#39;ll come up<br/>
with an endless supply of things to look at under it.  My daughter (6)<br/>
was begging for one and we got her one for her 6th birthday.  She is now<br/>
6 and 5 months and she still spends countless hours mixing stuff up to<br/>
put under the microscope.  After we all had thought of everything easy<br/>
to look at (grass, leaves, feathers, fabric fibers of all kinds, etc.),<br/>
she started mixing up spices and other food ingredients to look at. <br/>
Lemon juice does look different when hot than when cold.  I can&#39;t even<br/>
count all the microscope experiments that she&#39;s done (some with food<br/>
colorings, some with ingredients that have been mixed then left to have<br/>
the liquid evaporate).  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the slides go, experiment with them, too.  You&#39;ll find out<br/>
pretty quickly why they are nice for liquids.<br/>

<br/>
The skin of an onion is always neat to look at because you can see the individual cells and cell walls so clearly. The part of the onion you want is that thin tissue-like piece that peels away. Is that making sense? If not I can try to explain it better. You can get iodine and stain it so that you can see it better. If you have any kind of science store, you should be able to get stain cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Scrapings from the inside of your cheek is a great idea too!  <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites was always pond water. There are little organisms that look like miniature copies of bigger animals. I remember one looking like a crab! For pond water you will need a cover slide.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...I can&#39;t think of anything. You have some good ideas already. Don&#39;t forget that you can use, I think it is the high objective, for oil immersion. Oil immersion allows you to see things even larger than your highest objective- a lot larger. I don&#39;t know the kind of oil that is supposed to be used too. I don&#39;t know if you can substitute any oil around the house, like vegetable oil, or not. If you use oil though make sure you clean the lenses really well with lense paper afterwards.  <br/>

Oh, you can later do two things- add water to your onion cells and observe and then add a salt solution to your onion cell and observe. This demonstrates osmosis. When you add the salt, the cells should shrink. When you add water, they should enlarge. Sometimes they will even burst.  <br/>

Mold is cool to look at. Bagels, homemade bread, shredded mozzarella, and<br/>
cream cheese all get moldy pretty quickly. Take a sample of dust out of<br/>
your vacuum cleaner bag and look at it. SCARY! Fish scales are fun too.<br/>

lots of very doable experiments. It&#39;s a good starting point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171744510">At the natural history museum here they have a low table with microscopes <br/>
mounted around it.  We keep a collection of stuff to look at.  Cool thing <br/>
about these is that they can be backlit or toplit, or both (the dial moves <br/>
along the range of top to bottom), so you can look at stuff from the top.  <br/>
Credit cards are GREAT.  The holograms, especially.   Coins.  The edges of <br/>
fingernails--gross.   Cuts and splinters--COOL!    Keys are fun.  The edge of <br/>
paper.  Thread, cloth.<br/>
<br/>
The museum has a little collection of stuff like snake skin and feathers and <br/>
bugs, but sometimes the stuff we&#39;ve taken has been more fun, and we leave <br/>
some stuff there each time.<br/>
<br/>
We should go tomorrow. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

penicillin and compare live active cultures to dead(?) inactive cultures.<br/>

My brother sent us one from a vector control lab that was selling off old<br/>
equipment and buying new.  It&#39;s a great scope, it was well taken care of<br/>
and it was just a couple of dollars.<br/>
