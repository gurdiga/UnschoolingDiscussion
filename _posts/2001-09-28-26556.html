<br/>
I have been told, more than once, that citrus is a good cat repellent. <br/>
You could spray one of those citrus cleaners on the ground, it would<br/>
probably help with the smell too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852386346">Does anyone know of a kid-safe cat repellant?<br/>
<br/>
We live in an apartment and have a small plot of dirt outside our door<br/>
where the kids used to play. Lately all the neighborhood cats have been<br/>
using it as their litterbox. Not only can the kids not play out there,<br/>
but now it stinks to walk out the door. I&#39;d love to make the cats want<br/>
to stay away from our door entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Grrr! Now some baby cat is trying to come IN! YUK! HELP PLEASE!<br/>
<br/>

Try some of the organic gardening places.  Gardens Alive!  maybe?  Call<br/>
your local county extension agent, or your local health food store. <br/>
Greenhouses and nurseries sometimes sell them.  Something organic might<br/>
be kid safe.   Sorry I don&#39;t know a brand name.  I employ the  open the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968359248">I don&#39;t WANT them in! I don&#39;t hate cats...but it&#39;s getting pretty hard not<br/>
to. I certainly don&#39;t want to live with them. These are other people&#39;s cats<br/>
who just let them out to piss in other people&#39;s spaces. YUK! We live in an<br/>
apartment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275211555">Dump a bunch of cayanne pepper over the ground.  Keep the kids out of it for<br/>
a couple of days.  Cats always sniff around and a nose full of cayanne will<br/>
usually send them looking for somewhere else.  If that doesn&#39;t work, let me<br/>
know and I&#39;ll look in my old vet files.<br/>
