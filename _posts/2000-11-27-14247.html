<div>This is a neat gift idea!&nbsp; I have heard that you can use pine cones as

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25413048">yeah you can also melt down old crayons and candle stubs in a double boiler ( <br/>
an old bowl over a pot with bowling water) and pour it over the pine cones or <br/>
into the bottoms of the milk cartoons it works really well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889660009">I use candle drippings and stubs.  I collect them in coffee cans between <br/>
times, and melt them on the stove, with the coffee can inside an older (used) <br/>
pot which is sitting on something.  Sometimes it&#39;s a cookie cutter or a <br/>
&quot;church key&quot; can opener, and sometimes the edge is up on top of a little <br/>
stoneware cookie press.  Something not too tall, not too important, and which <br/>
won&#39;t be ruined by being in boiling water for a while.   That&#39;s to keep the <br/>
can from hopping around in there in making a mess.  Trust me.<br/>
<br/>
Then put aluminum foil on the counter next to where you&#39;re going to be <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
If your kitchen is all fancy, do this on a coleman stove or portable <br/>
hotplate, on a yucky table in a yucky place in your house or yard.  I&#39;ve done <br/>
it different ways.<br/>
<br/>
So get the wax melted.  It doesn&#39;t matter if there are aluminum votive-candle <br/>
wick-bases in there, or old aluminum foil or labels.  Let&#39;m be in there.  <br/>
<br/>
Dip sticks or bark or whatever, in kindling-sizes, like the size of your <br/>
finger, and long enough that you have a handle to deal with.  Wax on half the <br/>
stick is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Lay them out on aluminum foil or in a cardboard box (like beer or cat food <br/>
come in is good, or the lid from a case of paper), but the aluminum foil on <br/>
the counter can keep wax from making such a mess.  <br/>
<br/>
You can let the wax get hard again in the same can for next time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband recommends this (and I do it sometimes; did this time):  Put water <br/>
in with the wax.   You can dip higher up on the stick with less wax.  The <br/>
stick gets wax going in and coming out.  Having water under the wax in the <br/>
can doesn&#39;t hurt it.  The wax floats.<br/>
<br/>
This is not the greatest thing on the planet for the chimney, so you might <br/>
want to get the chimney cleaned as often as you should have already (or more <br/>
often, if you&#39;re a meticulous person who always calls the chimney cleaners on <br/>
time).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more aesthetic value in starting a fire with this than with paper, <br/>
though, and paper has that danger of floating up and out and onto your <br/>
neighbor&#39;s roof.  Yuck.  No waxy-stick has ever floated up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These don&#39;t make the first-pass firestarters, but the second.  Still start <br/>
the fire with teensy-kindling, but if you put in some small stuff and then a <br/>
couple of waxy sticks as a second layer, the wax will drip down on the other <br/>
stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I take the still-hot leftover wax outside and pour it where the <br/>
wood has been being split, or where there&#39;s a pile of bark we&#39;ve had for a <br/>
couple of years from some tree that had really stringy bark.  And then the <br/>
next day or so I go out and pick up clumps of wax-with-wood-crud things which <br/>
look ugly and aren&#39;t good enough for gifts and might have dirt in them, or <br/>
leaves or dog hair, but they&#39;re great for home use.  The pretty sticks go to <br/>
my friends&#39; houses. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For kids who are old enough to deal with hot wax and fire (not many of them <br/>
are; some adults aren&#39;t!) it&#39;s fun and not nearly as crazy-making as dipping <br/>
candles.  But  it might be a good warm-up practice for future candle dipping <br/>
(which also sometimes uses that water-in-the-bottom mix).<br/>
<br/>
Crayons tend to stink and spaark, but I&#39;ve used some as additives.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend them.  Some colors stain badly (even on bricks and such) <br/>
if dripped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445612626">In a message dated 00-11-26 21:31:27 EST, you write:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Like, where to get the cedar, how long do they have to be, what <br/>
 kind of wax <br/>
how much wax do you shoot for?  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forgot two questions:  cedar can come from a lumber yard, or from an old <br/>
fence post (depends what part of the country you&#39;re in!), or maybe from an <br/>
old fence that&#39;s broken and downed.  It could be redwood or pine or anything <br/>
else, I guess, if it&#39;s dry enough to split into little sticks.  Those slats <br/>
that go into chain link fences can be split up pretty easily if other kinds <br/>
of wood aren&#39;t available.<br/>
<br/>
Treated lumber wouldn&#39;t be a good idea.  Go for firewood.<br/>
Cedar&#39;s easy and fun to split, and smells GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
I split it with a hatched, on a sheet, sitting in front of the fireplace <br/>
watching movies.  I start with firewood which has a straight grain and I <br/>
split it smaller and smaller.  The bark can be peeled and torn into little <br/>
curly bits.  I can take a piece of firewood down to molecules and never miss <br/>
a word of the movie.  (Okay, I exaggerated:  just down to splinters...)<br/>
