<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042928833">For all those that think Dubya is the greatest thing since slice bread,<br/>
this link tells you what he thinks all schools should be like.  I&#39;ve<br/>
snipped the major part that I thought was particularly disgusting and ever<br/>
so Gothardish!<br/>

&quot;KIPP has had the full support of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the nations<br/>
leading advocate of the program.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;KIPPsters&quot; as these students have come to be known, attend school from<br/>
7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and spend four more hours in the<br/>
classroom on Saturdays with two hours of homework every night. And there is<br/>
no long break for summer fun as these kids also spend one month of each<br/>
summer in classes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Governor Bush is a big proponent of charter schools and especially of the<br/>
KIPP Academy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 If this is the kind of approach to improving public education that George<br/>
W. Bush has in mind for the rest of the country, it is little wonder so<br/>
many educators, in Texas and out, are saying, Let George do it! <br/>
<br/>
Weelllll, IMHO, this is a prison sentence without a trial!  Oh, and if you<br/>
read the article, that evil, the NEA, that supposedly is only supporting<br/>
Gore is out in full force behind Dubya and the KIPP idea!<br/>
