<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794260754">I just finished reading &quot;And What About College?&quot;  How do most of you keep records?  With unschooling everything is a learning experience.  Therefore, how can you possibly record everything your kids are learning and break it all apart into subject areas and so forth? Even if the kids kept their own journal and did it themselves, they still would miss things maybe not realizing the importance of something right now, but it may effect them later on in the process and should be accounted for. It seems like they&#39;d have to be writing all of the time, as not to miss some learning experience in order to include it in their hours to get credit for that subject area.      What do most of you have planned for the long term in ways of diplomas, GED&#39;s,  nothing?  I don&#39;t know.  In the book the author issued their own transcripts, but kept records of hours spent in certain subjects to meet the requirements for credit hours. Clonlara does this too.  What are your thoughts on this private school?  It just seems like a lot of work to figure out if the kid is meeting the credit hours or not in their unschooling.  Then again, it may help to offer some guidance if the kid knows they have to study so many hours in a particular subject any way they like, as long as they do it.    Thoughts,    Robin</div>
