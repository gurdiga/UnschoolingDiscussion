ducks are the ducks at the Peabody Hotel in Orlando on Internatinal drive.  I was <br/>
there and every day the ducks come out and march around the hotel lobby. It is <br/>
very cute. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673352969">I think that answers my question, thanks :) A couple of people had <br/>
mentioned them as being the highlight of their trips. I don&#39;t live in <br/>
the US so didn&#39;t know what was special about the ducks.<br/>

very old hotel that has ducks swimming in it&#39;s fountain. Maybe just a <br/>
chicken/ egg argument--not sure who had them first. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783975583">The Peabody Hotel in Memphis is where the ducks live.  Every day at 11  and 5 <br/>
the ducks leave their palace on the roof, enter the elevator, and walk the  <br/>
red carpet into the marble fountain in the hotel lobby.  It&#39;s quite an  <br/>
attraction.  They are handled by a &quot;duckmaster&quot;, which is a sought after  position, <br/>
but pretty much held for life.  There&#39;s a kids book about the  ducks and large <br/>
crowds gather every day to see them come down.<br/>

 <br/>
How did the tradition of the ducks in The  Peabody fountain begin? Back in <br/>
the 1930s Frank Shutt, general manager of The  Peabody, and a friend, Chip <br/>
Barwick, returned from a weekend hunting trip to  Arkansas. The men had a little <br/>
too much Tennessee sippin’ whiskey, and thought  it would be funny to place some <br/>
of their live duck decoys (it was legal then for  hunters to use live decoys) <br/>
in the beautiful Peabody fountain. Three small  English Call ducks were <br/>
selected as “guinea pigs,” and the reaction was nothing  short of enthusiastic. <br/>
Thus began a Peabody tradition which was to become  internationally famous. The <br/>
original ducks have long since gone, but after more  than 70 years, the marble <br/>
fountain in the hotel lobby is still graced with  ducks. Today, the mallards <br/>
are raised by a local farmer and friend of the hotel.  The ducks live in the <br/>
fountain until they are full grown and, on retirement from  their Peabody <br/>
duties, are returned to the wild. <br/>
