&lt;&lt; What was Lorna Doon famous for, do ya know? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually spelled Lorna Doone in the original book. I have a very old and <br/>
tattered copy, part of my old book collection. This copy is from 1914 and is <br/>
signed on the front page to Olga Rickert from Edith W. as a Christmas gift.<br/>
It&#39;s by R.D. Blackmore and is titled &quot;A Romance of Exmoor&quot;<br/>
Embarassingly enough, I have not yet read it. Hey, I&#39;m a Bibliophilia and own <br/>
many books I have yet to read.....not enough time in a day.....sigh.<br/>
