artificial divisions of life into subjects!  I do think, though, that you<br/>

with my kids, I&#39;m not telling them that they are doing math.  I&#39;m not<br/>
playing the game with them so that I can check math off from the daily<br/>
curriculum.  I&#39;m playing because we enjoy playing the game.  But I AM<br/>
thinking in my head that they are learning math skills, along with good<br/>
sportsmanship, manual dexterity in manipulating the dice, practice<br/>
writing numbers, etc.  So I still believe that THEY are unschooling,<br/>

don&#39;t know, SSR is &quot;silent sustained reading&quot;, also known as reading a<br/>

reading, but if they tell me that they are bored, reading a book is one<br/>
of the many things that I might suggest.<br/>

For us unschooling is letting go of thinking about things in terms of<br/>

things that makes it so difficult (morally and actually) to fill out<br/>
progress reports for the school system.  When we play a game, it&#39;s only<br/>
because we feel like playing a game.  I can honestly say I never think<br/>
about<br/>
whether the kids have done enough math this week, or this year, or ever.<br/>
So, from our point of view, it is not &quot;strictly unschooling&quot; to put math<br/>
into our child&#39;s schedule.  For me it would feel like a violation of<br/>
trust<br/>
to let my child think I am just playing with them, while really I was<br/>
hoping<br/>
to teach them something without their noticing.  And to combat the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533922892">Good points.  I guess what I&#39;m saying is that -I- don&#39;t think about whether<br/>
they&#39;re learning math skills or manual dexterity or whatever, really, ever.<br/>
Does that make me deschooled?  Yay!  And what a nice civil conversation we<br/>
were able to have :).<br/>
<br/>
This made me think of something else.  I get asked a lot if my kids get<br/>
bored.  Would any of you say that your kids get bored more or less than the<br/>
schooled kids that you know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095834215"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">With regards to the boredom issue with schooled vs unschooled children, my 
<br>experience is that schooled (as in forcibly attending an institution)get 
<br>bored more quickly with boring things! As in things they are not interested 
<br>in, have never been interested in, and are being taught in such a way as to 
<br>ensure that any hope of any future interest is killed stone dead!
<br>
<br>There is emotion in this passage as my poor niece has just had her interest 
<br>in Dickens awakened by me, only to have her new found interest qustioned by 
<br>her teacher as &#39;irrelevent to her current curriculum.&#39;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704629963">Yes, Rue, I think you qualify as deschooled!<br/>
As for me, I am at least very grateful that I learned about homeschooling<br/>
when my children were so young that they have never been to school.  At<br/>
least they don&#39;t need to be deschooled.  (Anybody read the book<br/>
&quot;Deschooling Our Lives&quot;, edited by Matt Hern?  I&#39;d also like to read the<br/>
Unjobbing Handbook.  The Teenage Liberation Handbook is wonderful too.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as boredom: my kids don&#39;t seem to say they are bored very often. <br/>
Sometimes it seems to mean they are just tired and don&#39;t feel like<br/>
beginning anything.  They are most likely to be bored after they have<br/>
spent a LOT of time playing with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m currently reading &quot;Living Mindfully With Children&quot;.<br/>

late....don&#39;t even ASK why...)<br/>
<br/>
who wrote this book? Can anyone tell me a bit more<br/>
about it?<br/>
It sounds like a good one for my boyfriend. He&#39;s right<br/>
now doing the working on the &quot;ground floor&quot; of the<br/>
company thing...(his dad&#39;s company)...he programs the<br/>
database and helps produce the products for this<br/>
publishing company that he has invested alot of time<br/>
and energy into over awhile....and he basically cannot<br/>
be replaced right now very easily. The problem(s)? He<br/>
is getting burned out, and has to work long hours<br/>
right now while things are getting underway with this<br/>
new project...He doesn&#39;t get paid what they would have<br/>
to pay someone else to do the job and put as much work<br/>
into it...you know how it is when you are helping out<br/>
family... AND  he is an artist...really good with real<br/>
people caricitures...<br/>
AND my sister/me, etc...(our family tends to move<br/>
together, business wise)...used to travel around from<br/>
fair to festival and back again, etc, etc...doing &quot;wax<br/>
hands&quot; (sculptures out of people&#39;s hands in<br/>
wax..holding roses dipped in wax...etc..)...until my<br/>
dad had his stroke and we stayed in phx. for awhile...<br/>
and after he died we moved back here...and we had a<br/>
store in the mall for a little while but it wasn&#39;t<br/>
working out so my sis is going on the road again, cuz<br/>
she can make good money at it, and well...it&#39;s fun. we<br/>
like it. Me and my son went with her when he was 2 and<br/>
I was pregnant with dd and it was fabulous. I think<br/>
it&#39;s great for the kids. Anyway, my boyfriend really<br/>
wants to go on the road too now, doing caricitures or<br/>
something....and hm...how to put it...he is such a<br/>
carefree laidback hippie person at heart, but right<br/>
now his job (where he works with mostly older business<br/>
men, and business-minded investors and advertisers)<br/>
requires him to be the opposite and deal with things<br/>
as though he IS an older business-minded man, when he<br/>
is only 26 and wants to travel and draw and unschool,<br/>
but worries alot about what other people think. (and<br/>
his family thinks the idea is crazy) He thinks about<br/>
everything very logically by nature, which is good,<br/>
especially with me cuz sometimes I lack in that area,<br/>
and am TOO spontaneous. His problem here comes in with<br/>
lack of confidence that he can actually make a living<br/>
drawing and not having a &quot;real job&quot; and that be OKAY,<br/>
with letting go of the whole &quot;how much money per hour&quot;<br/>
concept, and ...well, just letting go and doing<br/>
something that everyone else (especially people who<br/>
have never made a living this way) may think is crazy.<br/>
I was talking to him this morning about going...(the<br/>
fair season is about to start and my sister was<br/>
talking to him about going)... and he really wants to<br/>
but I was trying to explain that he won&#39;t enjoy it if<br/>
he is in this mentality. I even compared it (in my<br/>
mind, to myself) to having to &quot;deschool&quot; him from the<br/>
way of thinking that he has to be in right now for his<br/>
job...and how it is the same cuz he will have to/is<br/>
having to defend himself and this &quot;crazy, ridiculous&quot;<br/>
idea of what to do right now to his family and<br/>
friends...his sister made a joke to me the other day<br/>
that he was going to run away with circus people...<br/>
she didn&#39;t want to &quot;burst his bubble, though, by<br/>
saying something&quot;. They are well-meaning, but you<br/>
know, it&#39;s an off the wall thought to people who have<br/>
everything planned out before they do it...and there&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with that, but it is just very much not<br/>
me. whew. that was rambly. I missed this board. Thanks<br/>
for reading that whole thing. Any advice or ESPECIALLY<br/>
books and what not like that that anyone can offer<br/>
would be greatly appreciated. If he sees that other<br/>
people somewhere sometime have done it (with a family)<br/>
then he would feel alot better....like finding this<br/>
site and board did for me and<br/>
unschooling....strengthened my resolve, you might say.<br/>
