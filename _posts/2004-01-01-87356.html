<div id="ygrps-yiv-503267744">To all of you! It&#39;s been months since I&#39;ve posted. We moved to a<br/>
wonderfully larger home. Three times the size of our first house. Each of<br/>
the boys have their own room which has been great all around for everyone.<br/>
We got moved (end of Oct) and settled. Then I started the job hunt.<br/>
<br/>
  I found a fulltime seasonal job for my oldest ds and myself. It ended<br/>
right before Christmas. (I&#39;m hoping they call me back for Valentines Day<br/>
shipping) Whew was it rough working and making time for the boys but we did<br/>
it. Dh and Jonathan, some of you may remember him from the conference,<br/>
pitched in and helped a lot. I must say that Michael, my oldest, was a real<br/>
trooper. He got pretty sick right after we started but he hung in there and<br/>
didn&#39;t miss a day or anything. Didn&#39;t really surprise me much but I did<br/>
expect more complaining. Even with his college classes the first two week he<br/>
did well getting up and ready at 6am. I&#39;m glad that last week he didn&#39;t have<br/>
class. We are both not at all morning people. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll do my traditional thing of putting the tree and decorations away. At<br/>
least this year I don&#39;t have to do the dance to stay out of the way of the<br/>
football game on TV. LOL! Playing with the kids has become more of a joy<br/>
after 3 1/2 weeks of not having that option. I missed them terribly and they<br/>
tryed to do a catch up with me each evening. I&#39;m weeks behind on these lists<br/>
but you are all there when I get a few minutes when the boys are asleep and<br/>
I&#39;m not. Which hasn&#39;t been often. LOL! I thanks you for being there. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I plan to work at our old house painting and such to get it ready to sell<br/>
sooner. I can paint and clean but Jim (dh) will need to refinish the wood<br/>
floors and a few other thing. The sooner we get it on the market the sooner<br/>
I won&#39;t have to work for $$. Oh, how I miss having my time to spend freely<br/>
with my boys. <br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year<br/>

&quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns.  Therefore, we do not need to<br/>
motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying.  We do<br/>
not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.<br/>
What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as<br/>
we can into their lives.  Give children as much help and guidance as they<br/>
ask for; listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and then get out<br/>
of the way.  We can trust them to do the rest.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421121312">Ren, how funny, right after reading your &quot;unit<br/>
studies&quot; post, I got this link from another list....<br/>

It has all sorts of interesting crafts and info, for<br/>
those digging that Chinese New Year vibe.....or who<br/>
want to find out a bit more about it. <br/>
<br/>
I am going to make a few paper lanterns, at least! <br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, we&#39;re going to Chinatown&#39;s New Year&#39;s<br/>
parade for the first time. I can&#39;t wait. <br/>
