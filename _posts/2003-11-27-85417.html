<div id="ygrps-yiv-797245044">&quot;I would never tell my husband what he could or couldn&#39;t do, i.e. <br/>
needing my permission. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Never? Are you sure? Having personal boundaries means you DO tell people &quot;no, that is NOT ok&quot; about certain things. If my dh was going to do something that bothered me, I would tell him so. It&#39;s called respect. You aren&#39;t doing your children any favors if you know (according to you) that they will be disappointed on X-mas day without any gifts to open. Telling them &quot;do whatever, it&#39;s yours&quot; is why they&#39;re opening them. <br/>
Until a gift is GIVEN, it&#39;s not the other persons. And why even wait until Christmas day to have a celebration if you&#39;re going to just let them do &quot;whatever&quot;? I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
Either you care about having gifts on Christmas day or you don&#39;t. They do, you said so. So understand enough about child development to realize they don&#39;t have the self control of an adult and keep things put away.<br/>
Maybe put out a dollar store goody every few days that they can open, to make it easier to wait. I think each family can do have their own unique ways of celebrating, and if opening the gifts all month works for you, great! But you&#39;re saying it won&#39;t make them happy, and yet you don&#39;t seem to want advice to the contrary.<br/>
Freedom doesn&#39;t equal ignoring other people&#39;s needs/desires/ wants. I don&#39;t think it helps children figure out the world to not point those things out to them. I think it&#39;s hugely ignoring children&#39;s capabilities and development to say &quot;do what you want&quot; and KNOW they will be sad on Christmas day and yet lack the ability to control their desire to see the gift.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421540935">The other thing that bother me about the whole issue of should-the-kids-just-open-everything  is what do YOU want? I would personally be very upset if my kids didn&#39;t have a bunch of presents and fun stuff to open on Christmas day.<br/>
Giving children choices and respecting them does not equal disregarding your own desires/wants/needs. It means EVERYONE&#39;S desires are important and as a family we work together to achieve good for all. My children know it&#39;s important to me to have presents on Christmas day and they&#39;ve never disregarded my feelings about that. I can leave stuff out for a couple of weeks with no one bothering them. SHaking and discussing and pondering, yes. Opening though? Never.<br/>
My desires are important too!!! Saying you&#39;d NEVER tell your dh or kids what to do or not do makes me think you have a hard time setting personal boundaries. Is this the case?<br/>
YOUR desires are important too.<br/>
Never telling another human I love what to do or not do isn&#39;t my goal. Respecting their wishes and desires IS. But if someone wants to do something that bothers another person I will ask them to stop, and if they choose to continue a harmful behavior I will TELL them to stop.<br/>
There is freedom and there are other equally important values to learn in this life. Freedom isn&#39;t the only one.<br/>

Argh.  Shaking and touching are OUT.  My kids are BRILLIANT. :)  They ALWAYS <br/>
guess correctly.  Spoils it for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have disguised presents in the past, but it&#39;s no fun and I&#39;m usually too <br/>
busy most years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771930617">Advent calendars are good for this, religious or not. The children get <br/>
a little mini-celebration every day starting December 1. (This year our <br/>
8-year-old is actually counting the days to December First on the kitchen calendar, <br/>
rather than to Christmas Day! Really!)<br/>
<br/>
       We&#39;ve always had a Nutcracker Calendar, a stand-up board with tiny <br/>
illustrated  books each telling a few lines of the ballet story. Dad puts on his <br/>
velvet Santa hat and we all sit together as the children produce the book of <br/>
the evening for reading aloud. Then the youngest child present at the reading <br/>
gets to choose a spot on the tree to hang the book (there&#39;s a little gold cord <br/>
on each one.) The story builds and the tree fills up until Christmas Eve, when <br/>
the tall SugarPlum Fairy book is read by firelight. During the day, children <br/>
often remove the books from the tree to play with, read and replace (we also <br/>
put all their real Christmas books away with the decorations each year, and set <br/>
them out under the tree as colorful &quot;atmosphere.&quot; They get enjoyed a LOT this <br/>
way!)<br/>
And the spot under the tree doesn&#39;t seem bereft even the very first day we <br/>
put it up.<br/>
<br/>
       This year, I guess tradition will be flexing a bit. Our son found his <br/>
own Advent calendar at a bookstore. That&#39;s why he&#39;s counting down the days. <br/>
It&#39;s a big Lego box with 24 little compartments, and inside each one (it seems - <br/>
we haven&#39;t reached Dec 1 yet to see) are a few Lego parts that can be built <br/>
into a tiny Lego Santa or sled or evergreen or other Christmas character or <br/>
object. I think as the month goes on, they can be played with and recombined <br/>
(that&#39;s how I would have designed it &lt;g&gt;) but don&#39;t know for sure. Will let you <br/>
know next week.<br/>
<br/>
       So the plan here is to use both calendars this year. DS has asked for <br/>
his at breakfast and the Nutcracker reading each evening, to give him <br/>
something to look foward to at both ends of every day. :)<br/>
<br/>
       Or, I wonder if anyone has ever tried Advent cookies? Bake a different <br/>
kind every day, with the children helping all along and then setting out the <br/>
plate each afternoon to be eaten before the next day? You could put peppermint <br/>
chips in sugar cookies the first day, then use green food coloring, etc and <br/>
lead up to shape cookies and sprinkles as the Big Day nears. Hmm --  JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt; So understand enough about child development to realize they don&#39;t have <br/>

<br/>
Aha!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Advent calendars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who do advent calendars with a clue to where a real gift is. <br/>
 I can be really small, or a Christmas tree ornament, or a promise of lunch <br/>
at McD or a hike to find pine cones, but that way they could have a count-down, <br/>
have more gifts, and not screw up Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Marty about the original question last night.   Marty and I have <br/>
been having good little exchanges about what he perceives is going on, since I <br/>
didn&#39;t talk TO my kids about what my theory was so much as I just lived it.  <br/>
He heard things at the conference in August he hadn&#39;t heard before, and said <br/>
he thinks all unschooled kids should go to some conferences before they <br/>
homeschool their own kids (that&#39;s not exactly what he said, but I don&#39;t remember what <br/>
he said--it was something about not understanding so much of the reasoning <br/>
behind how we lived until he heard me explaining it to other people).<br/>
<br/>
So Marty said this:  &quot;I think it&#39;s about teaching your kids morals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the answer I expected, and I said &quot;You think it&#39;s about morality? <br/>
 Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said they need to learn right and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I talked about people&#39;s plans and feelings and he agreed.  So what for me was <br/>
seeming like courtesy, he upgraded to morality.<br/>
<br/>
Years back my kids used to ask to open a gift early and we&#39;d do that <br/>
Christmas eve, but they disappointed themselves a few times and decided against it <br/>
pretty easily on their own, as a group.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the idea that the gifts aren&#39;t given until the gift-opening <br/>
moment.  I also think they&#39;re part of the decor, not just at Christmas, but at <br/>
weddings (when they&#39;re displayed in all their silvery paper) and birthdays (the <br/>
cake is in one place, the gifts are in another place).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the traditional ceremony is primary, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving&#39;s a good day to give an example.  If there&#39;s a lot of food being <br/>
made, people COULD just eat all day, but then there&#39;s no culminating feast to <br/>
sit down to.  It spoils the tradition.   I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason to <br/>
starve kids way past their regular mealtime, either.  It&#39;s a day of naturally <br/>
occuring celery sticks, at least! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes something is made just for the family.  A tray of brownies might be <br/>
made because someone wanted brownies.  But it&#39;s worth asking before getting <br/>
into them, because they might have been made a a gift or for a potluck.   My <br/>
kids always ask about trays of food they see being prepared.   When they were <br/>
younger, they were more likely to pass through and know what the plan was, but <br/>
now that they&#39;re in and out more they&#39;ll ask.<br/>
<br/>
I have another couple of things to say, but I want to read other people&#39;s <br/>
comments first.   I went to bed last night without getting back online.  Kirby <br/>
and his friends were doing computer stuff and I let them have uninterrupted <br/>
whatever-they-were-doing.<br/>

My kids don&#39;t eat that many cookies.  <br/>
You&#39;d be making a requirement to eat cookies ceremoniously! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
