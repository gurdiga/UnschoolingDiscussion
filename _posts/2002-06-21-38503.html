 </span></blockquote>I was responding to people blaming their parents or step-parents for not <br/>
teaching them about cleaning. I don&#39;t see it as needing a whole lot of <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; -- it isn&#39;t that hard to learn IF someone wants to learn it. There <br/>
just isn&#39;t that much to it that would have to be taught by someone who is <br/>
more expert, is there? There might be -- I might not know it (and Sandra and <br/>
many others here have seen my house so I should say that I do know HOW to <br/>
clean a lot better than what it looks like - I really just don&#39;t like to take <br/>
the time). And there a b&#39;zillions of household hints books and websites, etc. <br/>
They&#39;re sometimes fun. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t separate colors and whites - I separate new colors from everything <br/>
until they&#39;ve been washed a few times so they won&#39;t bleed. After that - I <br/>
wash everything together unless it seems to be something particularly <br/>
delicate because I noticed there was a &quot;delicate&quot; setting on the washing <br/>
machine and figured that was what it was for. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173467586">About constipation and irregularity...how about bran cereal? (my kids like Fiber One and 100% Bran)  You can also try oatmeal and add some oat bran (usually in the hot cereal section).  You can also use these in other things...sprinkle on salad, ice cream, yogurt...  Will she eat salad...good fiber here!  Whole grain bread?  Also, lots and lots of water!  Good luck!  <br/>

Well there&#39;s an idea!  <br/>
<br/>
Tea doesn&#39;t do it, though.  I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s something in the hot chocolate <br/>
mix that my gall bladder used to take care of and now that my gallbladder has <br/>
gone to rest before me, things are somewhat different.<br/>
<br/>
Tea&#39;s better anyway.   But I have sometimes consciously decided to use hot <br/>
chocolate in a medicinal way.</div>

coffee and hot cocoa, its the combination of caffeine and hot water. Dr. <br/>
Pepper will do it too! &lt;g&gt; Its the prune juice!<br/>
