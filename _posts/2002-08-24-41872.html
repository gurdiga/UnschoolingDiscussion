 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but I think someone forgot to tell a lot of government employees that.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of confusing those who don&#39;t understand why some things <br/>
of a political nature are okay (opinions, musings, explorations, <br/>
analysis, news and ideas) and others (grandstanding) aren&#39;t, I should <br/>
note here that I and many others on this list are political animals, <br/>
and see political action in everything unschoolers do, and it *WILL* <br/>
get discussed on this list. Ned knows what I&#39;m talking about: that <br/>
fine line between discussing issues and promoting political ideals. <br/>

If you get caught shop-lifting and pay a fine, the state owns your (what?) <br/>

<br/>
Mind you, I don&#39;t agree with fining parents *or* kids for truancy because I <br/>
don&#39;t agree with compulsory schooling.  But your logic just doesn&#39;t work, Ned.<br/>

parents?  Really?  Is it really about ownership?<br/>
