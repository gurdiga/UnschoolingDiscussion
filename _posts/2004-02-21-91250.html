THE CRITICAL THINKING & THE LIFE-LONG SELF-LEARNING MOVEMENT(S)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a &quot;Critical Thinking Movement&quot; in American universities that<br/>
<br/>
closely parallels a recent White Paper, &quot;Life-Long Self-Learning Movement,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
on K-12 innovations.   They seem to be saying the same thing,-- abandon the<br/>
<br/>
current school systems and create a radically different universal learning<br/>
<br/>
system. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Universities across the country are recognizing that &quot;Americans can expect<br/>
<br/>
to change jobs as many as half a dozen times in their lives.&quot;  No amount of<br/>
<br/>
university education, as now given, can provide the skills and knowledge<br/>
<br/>
required  for a long fullfiling and productive life.  Universities must<br/>
<br/>
transform themselves to produce &quot;critical thinkers.&quot; They must cultivate<br/>
<br/>
open minds, able to face any problem, economic, political, scientific, or<br/>
<br/>
social,  with balanced, critical, reflective judgement.  This does not mean<br/>
<br/>
abandoning the learning of,technical and scientific knowledge, nor the arts<br/>
<br/>
and humanities. It means aproaching all knowledge with a more questioning,<br/>
<br/>
wholistic, exploratory and less dogmatic mind. To recognize that most<br/>
<br/>
decisions are made in a field of uncertainty requiring judgement and wisdom<br/>
<br/>
as much as reason and facts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty universities are having in producing critical thinkers is, as<br/>
<br/>
one professor puts it, &quot;that even 4 years of college only brings<br/>
<br/>
traditional-age college students to a very low level of critical thinking<br/>
<br/>
and judgement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to see how anyone could expect much better.  Young<br/>
<br/>
people in K-12 schools are imbued with exactly the opposite mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian, undemocratic, hierarchal schools prepare<br/>
<br/>
students for an authoritarian, undemocratic hierarchal world.  Students are<br/>
<br/>
taught to obey orders, work on schedule, and accept authority.  Nothing<br/>
<br/>
could be more contrary to critical thinking.  It is clearly not only<br/>
<br/>
unreasonable, but also inefficient, to spend 12 years teaching people to<br/>
<br/>
accept order and control, and then 4 years attempting to erase that order<br/>
<br/>
and control mode from their minds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These facts have been recognized in a White Paper on &quot;The Life-long<br/>
<br/>
Self-learning Movement&quot; drated by an ad hoc group of citizens concerned with<br/>
<br/>
the failure of the K-12 schools.  It points out that there are a host of<br/>
<br/>
actions aimed an producing a radically different learning system.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling, Charter Schools, Folk Schools, Vouchers, Democratics Schools,<br/>
<br/>
Parent Directed Education, and many other learning innovations are replacing<br/>
<br/>
the schools of the past.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Together these two movements show the need for a radically different<br/>
<br/>
life-long learning system. We need to abolish the barriers between higher<br/>
<br/>
and lower education, as well as the barriers between real life and school<br/>
<br/>
life at all levels.   This is the challenge facing all elements of our<br/>
<br/>
current cultures.<br/>

THE WHITE PAPER<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         <br/>
<br/>
             THE lIFE-LONG SELF-LEARNING MOVEMENT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       In the past three decades, there has been a growing movement to<br/>
<br/>
reinvent the way citizens learn and how young people are introduced into<br/>
<br/>
society. Homeschooling, charter schools, cyberschools, unschooling,<br/>
<br/>
life-long learning, Waldorf schools, and Sudbury schools are just a few of<br/>
<br/>
the elements of this movement. The movement has been growing exponentially<br/>
<br/>
each decade since 1980. It has become a challenge to the traditional<br/>
<br/>
school/teach/educate system. Life-long learning has been promoted by<br/>
<br/>
management guru Peter Drucker in &quot;Post Capitalist Society&quot; on one end of the<br/>
<br/>
spectrum and, on the other end, by Elise Boulding in &quot;Building Global Civic<br/>
<br/>
Culture,&quot; and by many scholars in between.<br/>
<br/>
       The bottom line in this movement is to provide the freedom,<br/>
<br/>
opportunity and resources for self-learners of all ages, with their families<br/>
<br/>
and in community, to choose to learn what they want, when they want and how<br/>
<br/>
they want -- to self-learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RECOGNITION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       In spite of the rapid growth of this movement, it has drawn little<br/>
<br/>
positive attention from governments. Professional educators and their unions<br/>
<br/>
have shown concern that the proliferation of homeschooling will draw funds<br/>
<br/>
away from the public school system. A few public school systems have<br/>
<br/>
accepted the challenge and established special programs to provide would-be<br/>
<br/>
homeschoolers and other self-learners more autonomy within the public school<br/>
<br/>
system. Some have established parent-teacher programs that depend on<br/>
<br/>
parental involvement and give parents greater autonomy in the learning<br/>
<br/>
process. But, as parents are increasingly recognizing that personal liberty<br/>
<br/>
and private protection from control by majority rule applies to their<br/>
<br/>
children&#39;s learning, none of the existing systems have completely<br/>
<br/>
incorporated that concept. Nor do they fully meet the needs of our<br/>
<br/>
information society which requires a life-long learning system to provide<br/>
<br/>
for each individual&#39;s continual learning processes, as detailed in the work<br/>
<br/>
of writers and thinkers from John Holt and Alfie Kohn to Daniel Pink and<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner, among so many others.<br/>
<br/>
       Foundations, likewise, have been slow to rise to the challenge and<br/>
<br/>
opportunity that is unfolding. The millions of dollars for public schools,<br/>
<br/>
coming from all levels of government, is followed by millions more coming<br/>
<br/>
from private foundations. But little, if any, of this private funding is<br/>
<br/>
available for the many non-public school experiments being undertaken. A<br/>
<br/>
search of the philanthropy databases with words like &quot;democratic shools,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;homeschooling,&quot; or &quot;deschooling&quot; comes up with no program in any<br/>
<br/>
foundation. Whereas a search under &quot;schools&quot; or &quot;education&quot; comes up with<br/>
<br/>
many thousands. Individual appeals to hundreds of foundations by &quot;homeschool<br/>
<br/>
support groups,&quot; &quot;learning co-ops&quot; and other forms of nonschool learning<br/>
<br/>
communities are regularly returned with the words &quot;this proposal does not<br/>
<br/>
fit into our current program of support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MOTIVATION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       Motivations for moving toward self-learning and abandonment of<br/>
<br/>
traditional public schooling are many. Perhaps the most prevalent is<br/>
<br/>
parental concern about the loss of control of the learning of young<br/>
<br/>
children. Many families want to take direct responsibility for their<br/>
<br/>
curriculum, approach to learning, and the principles and values upon which<br/>
<br/>
these are based. Some parents believe that the public school system instills<br/>
<br/>
values which run contrary to those of their family. Some are explicitly<br/>
<br/>
guided by their religious beliefs to direct the education of their children.<br/>
<br/>
Others have had disturbing experiences with schoolyard bullies, unfeeling<br/>
<br/>
teachers, or misdirected bureaucracies. A few hold that government support<br/>
<br/>
is inherently controlling, and that their tax dollars are binding families<br/>
<br/>
to a failing system.<br/>
<br/>
      Self-learners are also influenced by education critics, philosophers<br/>
<br/>
and religious leaders. Some, like Ivan Illich, believe our current life,<br/>
<br/>
including school, is based on the principle of work now for future rewards.<br/>
<br/>
They urge that schooling, and life, be convivial and vernacular. That is,<br/>
<br/>
that learning and work should be carried out in joyful collaboration with<br/>
<br/>
family, friends and neighbors. And that it should be embedded in the local<br/>
<br/>
culture, ecology, and friendships.<br/>
<br/>
       With Paulo Friere, some see schools as perpetuating the socioeconomic<br/>
<br/>
rich/poor status quo and preventing the natural social evolution that would<br/>
<br/>
occur if future citizens were given more freedom to self-learn in their own<br/>
<br/>
families, communities, and nature.<br/>
<br/>
       Following John Holt and others, many believe that every brain, that<br/>
<br/>
is every student, is unique and no two are prepared to learn the same thing<br/>
<br/>
at the same time in the same way. They believe that schooling is not an<br/>
<br/>
efficient way to learn, nor for future citizens to be introduced into<br/>
<br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
       Most great philosophical traditions, including those embodied in<br/>
<br/>
Gandhi, Tagore, Aurobindo and Krishnamurti, recognize a spiritual component<br/>
<br/>
to learning, teaching that knowledge is more than a way to get a job or<br/>
<br/>
score well on a standardized test; that it is the purpose for living, it is<br/>
<br/>
being human. Rabindrnath Tagore started his learning community,<br/>
<br/>
Santiniketan, to transform the human mindset from self-interest, competition<br/>
<br/>
and materialism to mutual aid, cooperation, and the love of learning.<br/>
<br/>
       Growing out of a variety of personal, philosophical, educational, or<br/>
<br/>
religious motivations, the life-long self-learning movement continues to<br/>
<br/>
expand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PROOFS OF EFFECTIVENESS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       It is impossible to measure the success of self-learning with tests,<br/>
<br/>
grades, and scores. Perhaps the most interesting successes are found among<br/>
<br/>
those learners who do not flourish in a traditional setting with standard<br/>
<br/>
measurements of success. These individuals are free to blossom in their own<br/>
<br/>
ways and do -- anecdotal evidence abounds about happy and successful<br/>
<br/>
learners who have traveled a nontraditional path to their own personal<br/>
<br/>
success. <br/>
<br/>
       Self-learners are equally honored among our greatest leaders. Thomas<br/>
<br/>
Edison, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Abigail Adams, Benjamin<br/>
<br/>
Franklin, the Wright Brothers, Helen Keller, Albert Einstein, and Margaret<br/>
<br/>
Mead are only a few of those who have learned without school. The newspapers<br/>
<br/>
are filled with stories of less well-known successes. Ryan Abradi, of Maine,<br/>
<br/>
showed an interest in numbers at an early age, so his parents let him stay<br/>
<br/>
home and self-learn; by age 10 he was working his way through second-year<br/>
<br/>
college calculus. Caitlin Stern of Haines, Alaska, stayed out of school and<br/>
<br/>
became a recognized expert by studying bald eagles in the wild. Jedediah<br/>
<br/>
Purdy, a self-learner from West Virginia, graduated summa cum laude from<br/>
<br/>
Harvard University; in 1996 he was selected as a Truman Scholar and as West<br/>
<br/>
Virginia&#39;s nominee for the Rhodes Scholarship. He then went on to Yale Law<br/>
<br/>
School and, in the meantime, wrote a best selling book.<br/>
<br/>
       The growth rate of self-learning is a partial measure of its success.<br/>
<br/>
From a few scattered homeschoolers in 1980, perhaps 20,000, the number has<br/>
<br/>
grown, according to Newsweek Magazine, to over 200,000 in 1990, and into a<br/>
<br/>
broad integrated network of an estimated 2,000,000 today.<br/>
<br/>
       Considerable research has shown that students learn much more easily<br/>
<br/>
when they self-learn. As long ago as 1930,  the &quot;8 Year Study&quot; of 30 special<br/>
<br/>
schools demonstrated that: &quot;The most effective schools used a different<br/>
<br/>
approach to learning.  Instead of organizing learning by subjects, they<br/>
<br/>
organized it around themes of significance to their students.&quot; There seemed<br/>
<br/>
to be an inverse relationship between success in college and formalized<br/>
<br/>
education as opposed to student selected learning.<br/>
<br/>
       A recent Cornell University study confirmed this and showed that<br/>
<br/>
schooled children become &quot;peer dependent&quot; while those who learned with their<br/>
<br/>
parents have more self-confidence, optimism, and courage to explore. A Moore<br/>
<br/>
Foundation study of children of parents who had been arrested for truancy<br/>
<br/>
found that their homeschooled children ranked 30 percent higher on standard<br/>
<br/>
tests than the average classroom child.<br/>
<br/>
       Providing possible insight into the reasons behind these successes, a<br/>
<br/>
UCLA project showed that the average schooled student receives 7 minutes of<br/>
<br/>
personal attention a day but the self-learner receives from 100 to 300<br/>
<br/>
minutes of attention daily. Following this, a Smithsonian Report on genius<br/>
<br/>
concluded that high achievement was a result of time with responsive<br/>
<br/>
parents, little time with peers, and considerable time for free exploration.<br/>
<br/>
       Standardized tests reflect self-learner success as well. Time<br/>
<br/>
Magazine reported that &quot;the average home schooler&#39;s SAT score is 1100, 80<br/>
<br/>
points higher than the average score for the general population.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       Dr. Lawrence M. Rudner, conducted a study in 1998 that included<br/>
<br/>
20,760 students in 11,930 families. He found that in every subject and at<br/>
<br/>
every grade level (K-12), homeschool students scored significantly higher<br/>
<br/>
than their public and private school counterparts. Some 25 percent of all<br/>
<br/>
homeschool students at that time were enrolled at a grade level or more<br/>
<br/>
beyond that indicated by their age. According to the study, the average<br/>
<br/>
eighth-grade homeschooler was performing four grade levels above the<br/>
<br/>
national average. The average ACT score was 21 out of a possible 36 for<br/>
<br/>
public schooled children. It averaged 23 for self-learners. This qualifies<br/>
<br/>
the average college-bound self-learner for the most prestigious<br/>
<br/>
universities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VISION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       This movement is not only addressing the why, how, when and what all<br/>
<br/>
citizens learn, but is also rebuilding the foundation for the society in<br/>
<br/>
which we all live. How we learn determines the kind of society we build.<br/>
<br/>
Authoritarian, hierarchal, undemocratic schools prepare future citizens for<br/>
<br/>
an authoritarian, hierarchal, undemocratic society. A life-long learning<br/>
<br/>
system based in family, community, society and nature could be the<br/>
<br/>
foundation for new democracies of freedom, equity and justice.<br/>
<br/>
       The movement continues to promote the concepts of life-long<br/>
<br/>
self-learning, in all its complexities, to a wider audience, to address<br/>
<br/>
critics on the issues of accountability and credibility, and to promote<br/>
<br/>
support to help those working to bring their ideals to fruition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198044982">Daniel Pink was a former White House speech writer, for Al Gore, I believe. He wrote the book _Free Agent Nation_ which argues that self-employed free-agents are the workers of the new economy. He ends his book by looking at homeschooling as free-agent education, the model for educating free agents for the new economy. I don&#39;t really recall him addressing unschooling, just homeschooling in general.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s speaking at this years Maryland Home Education Assoc. (MHEA) conference in April. It should be interesting. I&#39;d like to ask him if he&#39;s ever looked into unschooling and if it isn&#39;t closer to what he&#39;s getting at than school at home.<br/>
