Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I so needed to hear that right now.  It&#39;s nice to know I am not alone.  Redirecting works wonderfully when I have the energy for it.  This little guy is like the energizer bunny, he keeps going and going and going.  Sometimes I see him going in the room and I know he&#39;s up to something, but I just want to breath for a couple of minutes before I go see him.  <br/>

 <br/>
I don&#39;t have alot of advise for you,   but I just want to tell you how lucky your son is that you are an unschooling Mom.   You can see the wonderfulness in your son  and be patient with these things.<br/>
 <br/>
The reason I am feeling this right now is that I have a friend right now whose son is acting out in ways that others would see as &#39;unacceptable&#39;.  He&#39;s in kindergarten and having a hard time with schedules and potty training and all that.     Well,  instead of allowing her son to be himself and grow with that, she is opting to making home an unattractive place so he wants to go back to school.  I&#39;m sooooo sad for him.       He would thrive so well in a homeschooling/unschooled environment, but his mom thinks that the school is the best way to get him into shape.     To me its like breaking his spirit.  Poor guy.<br/>
 <br/>
So,  thank goodness you know of unschooling and I&#39;m sure its a phase and with your patience he&#39;ll flourish and grow to be a wonderful boy!<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s lucky to have you as his mom!<br/>

She doesn&#39;t even know what unschooling is.   So she just thinks about trying to sit with him and force him to read and write!       I have said several times that we don&#39;t do it like that but its not getting in to her brain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900601880">--He&#39;s lucky to have you as his mom!--<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Kelli!  I used to be a kindergarden teacher so I know what you mean.  There was this one little girl who was spirited and her mom kept her out of school until kindergarden.  She finally enrolled her in school and that is exactly what we tried to do (me, the principal, the other teachers), we tried to break her spirit. This mom was such a great parent but her mistake was to think that the school would somehow get her into shape like you said.  I often tell people who say to me that I can homeschool because I am a schoolteacher that the only thing I learned when I was a teacher was that I do not want to send my children to school and I do not want to teach them.  I wasn&#39;t a parent then and I did not question the value of school.  I feel like calling up this little girl&#39;s mom sometimes and tell what a wonderful child she has and tell about unschooling and how I think this little girl would benefit from that.   Who knows maybe someday I will.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

    &gt;&gt;My name is Manon and I have a 2 1/2 year old ds. He is spirited and lately <br/>
    &gt;&gt;he seems to love to do anything he is not supposed to be doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Hi Manon. It&#39;s been many years since I have parented a 2 1/2 year old, but <br/>
    I&#39;m still parenting a spirited child. She&#39;s 9 now and the joys and <br/>
    challenges just get more interesting as she gets older. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;He will go in the room and close the door telling me not to come in and <br/>
    &gt;&gt;either pee on the floor or eat paper or write on the walls.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I know this must be so frustrating for you, but this just brought such a <br/>
    smile to my face. I keep picturing your obviously bright, active, intense <br/>
    little guy doing what he can to stir things up. I mean what better way to <br/>
    get mom&#39;s attention than to give her advance notice of what&#39;s coming? :o) <br/>
    Easy for me to say, it&#39;s not my little one peeing on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
    At 2 1/2 I would think he&#39;s just doing some &quot;what happens if&quot; <br/>
    experimentation. My experience has been that these kinds of behaviors pass <br/>
    and it&#39;s best not to get too upset. Just deal with each one as they come up.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;We don&#39;t have a lot of rules (just what I consider essential). I know the <br/>
    &gt;&gt;problem might be in my reactions as I will sometimes yell or overreact <br/>
    &gt;&gt;when I just can&#39;t take it anymore. I usually try to remain calm and <br/>
    &gt;&gt;explain to him why I don&#39;t like him doing that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    We all yell sometimes. Just be mindful the next time and in this moment. I <br/>
    would also try to redirect him before he gets the chance to be alone to do <br/>
    his mischief. When he asks to be alone and you know what&#39;s coming, I&#39;d give <br/>
    him a hug and a smile and try to get him interested somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
    &gt;&gt;Sometimes it almost seems as if he wants me to go in the room and take the <br/>
    &gt;&gt;paper or whatever out of his hands while he has a good cry in my arms. <br/>
    &gt;&gt;It&#39;s like he&#39;s begging me to take control. What would you guys do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;d try to anticipate when he was going to act out and redirect. If he did <br/>
    something inappropriate I&#39;d tell hime why it was not okay and get to <br/>
    cleaning up or fixing the situation. If he needed me to hold him for a good <br/>
    cry, I&#39;d make that my first priority. I&#39;ve found that my 9 yo still needs a <br/>
    good cry now and then. It&#39;s like she&#39;s got excess energy and doesn&#39;t know <br/>
    what to do with it. Sometimes we can&#39;t work it out with physical activity <br/>
    and attention. Sometimes she just needs to vent. It&#39;s okay. It will pass.<br/>
<br/>
    Life is good.<br/>

she would be pleased. Our &quot;spirited&quot; children are so undervalued.<br/>
<br/>
I used to attend Beavers (like boy Scouts for 5-7-year-olds) with my middle <br/>
son because he did not like to stay without me, then I was a Leader for a <br/>
brief time. There were so many &quot;spirited&quot; boys whom I thought were just <br/>
normal boys of that age. I loved being around their energy and seeing the <br/>
joy they had in moving, yelling, and being with their friends. Instead of <br/>
going with this natural state, the other Leaders felt it was their job to <br/>
get them to settle down and do things like crafts, most of which they had <br/>
no interest in. Of course our job was to lead them in some way but it <br/>
should be something they can benefit from like learning about the outdoors. <br/>
One of the other Leaders, a mom of twin boys, thought I was nuts for <br/>
enjoying being there.  She just tolerated it for her sons. Though I guess <br/>
she was doing better than the parents who couldn&#39;t wait to drop their kids <br/>
off and never volunteered to help, which all parents were supposed to do on <br/>
occasion.<br/>
<br/>
The reason my son didn&#39;t want to stay, I found out, is that the favourite <br/>
punishment was to stand the child in a corner facing the wall in a time <br/>
out.  I think Eric had never been so humiliated in his life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-650520542">Manon, I also wanted to respond about your son. He sounds a lot like my <br/>
youngest, Simon, who is now three-and-a-half. Simon has been early with <br/>
everything (walked at seven months, ran at eight months). I used to say he <br/>
was three boys rolled into one - it certainly seemed sometimes that he was <br/>
three places at once :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any better advice for you than you have already gotten from <br/>
others. I do a lot of calming breaths. He has gotten much better. I can <br/>
actually sit down and relax my nerves once in a while.  Up till recently I <br/>
was like a lion on the hunt, always ready to spring, always listening for <br/>
every sound :-) It was exhausting but he is such a terrific kid - so much <br/>
energy and love of life.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember that Simpsons episode where Marge makes the whole <br/>
family clean up the house until it is spotless?  Then you see Homer and the <br/>
kids go into the kitchen. The swinging door shows a gleaming kitchen as <br/>
they go in, then as it swings back you see it is trashed again.  That&#39;s <br/>
what our house is like. We pick up the living room, I go in the kitchen for <br/>
15 minutes to cook supper, and the living room is completely wrecked. You <br/>
can&#39;t deny we actually live in our house.<br/>

<br/>
Just reading your posts and laughing my head off at your descriptions is taking away a lot of stress.  This is very good therapy.  Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110391921">I am not sure how she would feel about it. I guess that is why I am not calling her.  Also a lot of time has passed, that was over 3 years ago but she did have a younger son who would be just starting school now and who also seemed spirited.  The more I think about it the more I want to call her.  BTW, my heart just broke for your poor son.  Thank god he has a great mom like you to protect him.<br/>
