&lt;&lt; I had no idea! I knew about wet nurses, and always thought at least it was <br/>
breast milk. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With wetnurses it was.  When they could walk they came home (if they had been <br/>
put out).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My Grandma told me she used to make a formula out of condensed milk, water, <br/>
corn syrup and some other things. But I guess I assumed actual bottle <br/>
feedings from formula wasn&#39;t around pre twentieth century.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister got a pamphlet from a doctor in the 1980&#39;s, talking about formula.  <br/>
It had a little recipe, with amounts in cc&#39;s (to seem scientific, I guess), <br/>
and it had the ingredients, condensed milk, water and carbohydrate.  There <br/>
was a little footnote, and in small print it said &quot;table sugar.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She balked at him giving that to her (she was nursing her babies) and he said <br/>
&quot;Oh.  Those are old.  We shouldn&#39;t be giving them out anymore.&quot;   They WERE <br/>
old, like early 60&#39;s.  But he WAS giving them out for babies born in the <br/>
mid-&#39;80&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a photo of a little wooden cradle (17th c?) with a cow&#39;s horn mounted <br/>
on the side and they used pigs&#39; teats cut off and wrapped on there.  I have <br/>
read that there is a display of some of this historical equipment at the <br/>
medical school at UNM, right here in town, but I haven&#39;t been there.  And I <br/>
read that in the 80&#39;s, too, when I was being activist about baby-stuff, and I <br/>
don&#39;t know if the proprietor of it is still teaching there or what, or if the <br/>
university owned it.<br/>
<br/>
There was baby feeding equipment in some greek shipwreck inventory, I think, <br/>
from  a couple of thousand years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Professionally manufactured and pushed-hard formula is more recent, but using <br/>
cow&#39;s milk is old.  And the &quot;formula&quot; has only lately even made a not toward <br/>
acknowledging that maybe they should have tried to make it more like human <br/>
milk.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem is the don&#39;t even know what&#39;s IN human milk quite.  So <br/>
that&#39;s another part of history that has TOTALLY ignored instinct and the <br/>
rights and needs of children.  When they talk about infant mortality the <br/>
suggestion leans toward hospitals save lives, equipment saves lives, but they <br/>
don&#39;t factor in the ignorance that was taking lives which is no longer as <br/>
rampant as it was.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look for some online references on this stuff.<br/>

wouldn&#39;t be the same as what&#39;s in it tomorrow or next week or next year, or <br/>
even the difference between the beginning of a feeding and the end.  And <br/>
then there&#39;s the antibodies that start getting in the milk almost as soon <br/>
as a virus gets into the mother.  There&#39;s no way they&#39;ll *ever* be able to <br/>
duplicate mother&#39;s milk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After your post on this yesterday, I went and searched. I came up with a few <br/>
things. After putting in Breast feeding, History of bottle feeding, History <br/>
of formula and History of Infant feeding, the last got me the most results. I <br/>
found that although breastfeeding is historically the most common way to feed <br/>
infants, that a wet nurse was second. The ancient Egyptians and kings and <br/>
queens of England and France used this practice. They would interview women <br/>
looking to see if there were any *craziness* in the family (that could be <br/>
passed through the milk you know!) they would have the milk tasted and much <br/>
more. The wet nurses weren&#39;t always too concerned with their charges since <br/>
they had their own to look after as well, so there was a high infant <br/>
mortality rate. One countess (16th century) who had 18 children, all of whom <br/>
she sent out to be nursed. Only one son lived, and when his wife nursed his <br/>
own children and they all lived the countess wrote a pamphlet charging all <br/>
women to breastfeed their own children and not send them out. Besides wet <br/>
nursing, there have been instances of using an animal for a wet nurse. <br/>
Usually when the mother died, and the father was left to raise the child on <br/>
his own. A popular &quot;formula&quot; (called pap) in 17th-18th century England and <br/>
here in the States was a gruel made of cows milk, crushed walnuts, and either <br/>
corn or oatmeal. This was put into a pap feeder that looked like a small boat <br/>
with a hollow spoon, the pap was scooped into the spoon and then blown into <br/>
the babies mouth. Bottles have been made out of wood, clay, pewter, other <br/>
metals, and glass. The wooden ones had cloth or something stuffed into them <br/>
and the child would suck on that. The clay ones had a little spout that <br/>
babies sucked on. <br/>
I was amazed at all the things I read. Although there isn&#39;t much on the <br/>
subject. What really shocked me was what women still do today!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391800734">If you&#39;re *really* into this, check out Mother Nature, by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy<br/>
(not a typo!) Here&#39;s the ridiculously long Amazon link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679442650/qid=1025651477/sr=2-2/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679442650/qid=1025651477/sr=2-2/ref=</a><br/>

<br/>
I saw it in a bookstore and time just stopped while I read it. I finally put<br/>
it down but found it later in our library. It&#39;s thought-provoking, has the<br/>
potential to make you mad and cry at the same time. She&#39;s a primatologist<br/>
and approaches this from an evolutionary standpoint. Fascinating stuff.<br/>
