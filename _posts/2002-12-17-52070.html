Jack!! That&#39;s it. Couldn&#39;t think of it. You know I tried watching that show <br/>
twice when it first came on and just didn&#39;t find it funny. I kept hearing so <br/>
much about it and couldn&#39;t understand. Then just like a month ago I watched <br/>
again and thought it was just too funny. I guess it was just me or maybe it <br/>
got a lot better. Anyway, now I really enjoy it when I see it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501462330">I&#39;ve done that with shows. When ever a new one starts I watch the first TWo <br/>
shows before making a decision, sometimes the pilot is too explanatory and <br/>
not enough jokes.<br/>
