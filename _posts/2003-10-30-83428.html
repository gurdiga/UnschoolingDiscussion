now I&#39;m better. I think a part of the reason I didn&#39;t care as much about<br/>
spelling in school is that I knew the effect a few misspelled words would<br/>
have on my grade wasn&#39;t worth the irritation of looking them up. But now<br/>
it&#39;s myself I&#39;m putting out there when I write so I&#39;m motivated to spell<br/>
properly. When I&#39;m writing for just myself I do the best I can with<br/>
spelling, but when I&#39;m proofreading it, I get pretty anal about spelling.<br/>

I am a good speller. I wasn&#39;t five years ago or any time before that. I have <br/>
become a better speller with the help of spell check! There are common <br/>
misspelled words and words that I commonly misspell. With spell check I have learned <br/>
what those words are and when I come across them now, I can spell them. Five <br/>
years ago, or even fewer, I couldn&#39;t do that. The constant review, for me, was <br/>
what did it. Someone would then ask if this worked, then why didn&#39;t the <br/>
constant review in school work? I have an answer for that! In school the review of <br/>
spelling is done in lists. Ten new words a week with a test on Friday. <br/>
Absolutely no use of the words in everyday application. Here, I use a word, I always <br/>
misspell it, spell checker catches it, after a few times I see that word <br/>
spelled correctly and I begin to spell it correctly. After a few more times, I don&#39;t <br/>
see that word on the spell checker again. If I were the school at home type, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t use spelling programs. I would take words from the books my kids <br/>
were reading and words from their journals from other subjects and have them <br/>
keep a common place book just like people used to do hundreds of years ago. But <br/>
that is just me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;  In the last few years, I&#39;ve had to think about spelling some words a bit <br/>
more than I ever did before. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  I used to know by sight.  Maybe my memory bank of sight-stuff is <br/>
overflowing after all these years, because I used to look at it, and if I wasn&#39;t <br/>
sure, I&#39;d write it a couple of ways and decide *by sight* which was the one <br/>
I&#39;d seen a bunch, and then I&#39;d check a dictionary if I needed to.<br/>
<br/>
Now sometimes I just am not sure.   If I&#39;m at the computer I open a word <br/>
file, put the word in and let Word&#39;s dictionary convince me.  And I usually end up <br/>
playing around with that really fun function where as you type another letter <br/>
in it guesses which word you&#39;re after. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra&#39;s husband became a better speller.  Are there many more out there <br/>
who have learned this ability?  Both my husband and I were just born with it and <br/>
I have yet to meet a person who is a good speller and wasn&#39;t born to it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith still misspells &quot;coming&quot; as &quot;comming.&quot;  So did my dad.   My dad could <br/>
see NO sense in single or double letter situations where there was no chance <br/>
for confusion.  I have a letter he wrote me when I was a teenager, and he signed <br/>
it &quot;Dady.&quot;  (There being no long-a word, he figured once there are enough <br/>
letters to pronounce it correctly, he&#39;d done his job.)<br/>
<br/>
Both Keith and my dad were lefties.  Unfortunately, my dad was trying to be a <br/>
leftie in a West Texas one-room schoolhouse in the 1930&#39;s.  Ooops on that <br/>
one.  They forced him to use his right hand, and I think it scarred him for life. <br/>
 He feared and avoided reading and writing.<br/>
<br/>
Keith was a music-minded, math-minded pattern-seeing guy.  His handwriting is <br/>
jerky lefthanded small writing.   <br/>
<br/>
Some words he&#39;s learned because he uses them a lot.  &quot;Committee&quot; finally <br/>
settled for him.  AND I think the ei/ie problems are helped, with him, because his <br/>
name is Keith.  So he can sort words into exception/not more easily than <br/>
others because he has a personal stake in the ei/ie world.<br/>
<br/>
Schwa gives him trouble, but it does most people.  Probably most spelling <br/>
errors I see (or make) are an e for an a or vice versa in a word where the vowel <br/>
is making its lowest, unstressed boring noise.  &quot;Separate/seperate.&quot;  So my <br/>
boyfriend from college had a rule I still use:  &quot;there&#39;s a rat in separate.&quot;  A <br/>
Jr. High English teacher in Toronto had given him that gift.   He was an <br/>
English a second language case, and so much of his spelling was trick-based.  He <br/>
was useful that way.<br/>
<br/>
I think Keith just learned one or two words a year, and since he was <br/>
misspelling the same little batch of words, he&#39;s doing well with everything but <br/>
&quot;coming.&quot;  (I&#39;ll note his writing and report back.)<br/>

Oh I love spelling *tricks*!  Like piece of pie and finite in definitely.  <br/>
Most of my spelling is sight related, the words have to *look right*, for <br/>
others, I have to have a separate *spelling* pronunciation so they will stick in my <br/>
head (macabre).  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for my kids to write prose, however it may come out.  At this <br/>
point, they dictate stories for *me* to write down.  Hayden (5) is my list maker <br/>
but he still asks how to spell each word he writes or he substitutes a <br/>
picture instead.  I&#39;ve had to really brush up on my own spelling knowledge.  I can&#39;t <br/>
believe how many times, &quot;just because it&#39;s English&quot; has come out of my mouth <br/>
to explain why things are spelled *funny* (phone/knife/etc).  <br/>
<br/>
I love hearing about boys writing.  At our last hs meeting, there was a <br/>
general consensus that *boys just don&#39;t write* and I completely disagreed and was a <br/>
definite minority (I wouldn&#39;t want to write if I were FORCED to either! ~ oh <br/>
yeah, I didn&#39;t &lt;bg&gt;).  I don&#39;t know how/why Hayden writes, but I know it&#39;s <br/>
something he loves to do ~ all on his own.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982496680">I love the spellchecker because, being from Australia, some words simply<br/>
are spelled differently here (or there depending on your POV). Of course<br/>
the limitation is that if a word is spelled wrongly in context, but is<br/>
still a real word, the checker misses it. The only time misspelling<br/>
bothers me in casual writing is when the meaning becomes unclear, or<br/>
causes me to have to puzzle it out - but hey! Shit happens and when I<br/>
say &quot;bothers&quot; I mean bugs me for two seconds and then I move on. My only<br/>
pet peeve is &quot;Lose&quot; and &quot;Loose&quot; which seem to be used interchangeably,<br/>
and do sometimes alter meaning considerably. For example: &quot;I lose my son<br/>
to computer games&quot; vs &quot;I loose my son to computer games&quot;. The former<br/>
could be resentful, the latter a joyous and poetical expression of<br/>
freedom for the son.<br/>

<br/>
The ONLY thing (and we tried lots of things) that&#39;s worked for him is to learn the words as he uses them.  Not an arbitrary set that he&#39;s supposed to know.  He plays Tribes online and frequently asks how to spell whatever word he&#39;s having trouble with.  After four or fives times of my spelling it for him, he owns the word.  His writing of stories has also provided painless practice and improvement.  <br/>
<br/>
Andy told me just the other day that spelling is *much* easier when typing.  Handwriting just adds enough to the mix to cause the frustration.  Maybe that&#39;s why the spelling tests were so traumatic.  <br/>

Erica sits behind me and edits as I write!  She tells me, &quot;no, use <br/>
this word instead&quot; or &quot;why don&#39;t you put this phrase over there, it <br/>
would sound better&quot;--LOL.  I told her I&#39;ve created a monster!  When <br/>
she left school after six weeks into the 6th grade she couldn&#39;t <br/>
comprehend what she was reading let alone know when something was <br/>
grammatically incorrect.  <br/>

Holly does too.  I won&#39;t even hear her come up and if I&#39;m about to hit <br/>
&quot;send,&quot; sometimes she&#39;ll say &quot;WAIT!&quot; and scare the heck out of me.  Either she <br/>
hasn&#39;t finished reading, or she&#39;s seen a typo.<br/>

It&#39;s way better as a hobby than as an exercise session in the grammar yard at <br/>
the prison.<br/>
