<div id="ygrps-yiv-589896271">To the person looking for a church in Digest 2158:<br/>
<br/>
Katherine got it right in her answer...why bother with people who<br/>
want/expect you to explain yourself? Go where people accept you for what you<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
All you need now is to join the Libertarian Party and you&#39;ll be set.<br/>
Libertarians want you to be able to live exactly the way you choose.<br/>
<br/>
Still looking for a church that sees you as perfect just the way you are?<br/>
Check out Christian Science.<br/>
