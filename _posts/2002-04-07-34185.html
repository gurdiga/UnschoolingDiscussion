Then that is not unschooling, that is IMO controlling, but more of an eclectic approach to homeschooling. It is still your agenda, and this, to me, does not constitute faith or trust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881851033">various:<br/>
<br/>
-=- I decide whether they should persevere-=-<br/>
<br/>
That one line bothered me too.<br/>
&quot;Perseverence&quot; should come from within.<br/>
If someone else decides, you&#39;re being made to do something against your will <br/>
(forced or coerced maybe), not &quot;persevering.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t claim to be a vegetarian because I had no meat for<br/>
breakfast, I can&#39;t claim to be a Texan because I visit my grandparents<br/>
there a couple of times a year, I can&#39;t claim to be a teetotaller because<br/>
I haven&#39;t had any aloholic beverages to drink today.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think these are good analogies, but I must admit being wryly amused at the <br/>
idea of being an unschooler is kind of like being a Texan.  As a recovering <br/>
Texan, an adult child of Texans, and (I have been told) eligible for <br/>
membership in &quot;Daughters of the Texas Republic&quot; or some such (handmaidens of <br/>
the Alamo and other shrines), I think likening unschooling to Texas is funny <br/>
fun.    I never lived in Texas after I was six, but annual visits to <br/>
granny/papaw, mamaw/papaw were like booster shots for the accent and culture.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if a few generations from now unschoolers will be requiring their <br/>
kids to learn the history of unschooling, and forming a &quot;Daughters of the <br/>
Unschooling Movement&quot; and putting old e-mails in a library case somewhere to <br/>
show where their great grandmothers learned about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My <br/>
guess, though, is that they would rather spin around in circles until they <br/>
can&#39;t stand up anymore.  And it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t find that &quot;acceptable,&quot; <br/>
but it makes them really sick, which isn&#39;t in anybody&#39;s best interests, so <br/>
far as I can see.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they would rather spin til they puked than use a workbook, perhaps the <br/>
workbooks were way more expensive than they were worth.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say kids won&#39;t spin until they puke, but I remember two or <br/>
three times when I was nine or so, riding a schoolyard merry-go-round until I <br/>
puked, and once in college rolling down grassy hills in a park to the same <br/>
end, following an expensive visit to Baskin Robbins.<br/>
<br/>
But to this:  -=-I claim to be, and am, a homeschooler who uses a blend of <br/>
unschooling and <br/>
something else.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I believe people are objecting because unschooling isn&#39;t something to do <br/>
after &quot;schoolwork&quot; is done.<br/>
When I was in school as a kid, at public school, with homework and all, I <br/>
learned a ton of stuff on my own.  But I wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  My parents <br/>
weren&#39;t unschooling me by letting me paint and read and talk to friends on <br/>
the phone and hang out at the library and go to piano lessons.  The fact that <br/>
there were more &#39;free&#39; hours in my life than there were &#39;school hours&#39; <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean unschooling.<br/>

  These are excellent suggestions. I really like the way you have put this together. It offers a perspective we all could try to emulate . . . not trying to make someone wrong for their choices but instead asking questions to get them to think. . . something I bet we all do with young people.<br/>

I had to redirect her interest because I couldn&#39;t help her just then. <br/>
 Now that she is 14, if she decides to bake at 10 o&#39;click, I just say <br/>

When they were 13 and 15, the girls relied on me for a lot of things, <br/>
chauffer service not the least of them.  What they wanted to do was <br/>
often affected by what I was doing.  Now that Rachel drives, they have <br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s not gone.  If you have ideas for her, present them.<br/>
<br/>
If we discuss the person&#39;s ideas directly instead of discussing how the <br/>
person discussed ideas, then we&#39;ll be talking about unschooling instead of <br/>
talking about people.<br/>
<br/>
If the principles of free learning which many-not-all here have practiced for <br/>
many years with success ARE potentially applicable to other families, then <br/>
requiring some &quot;schoolwork&quot; and having either a little or a lot of free time <br/>
should probably be just considered eclectic homeschooling.  And if that&#39;s the <br/>
person&#39;s favorite part of homeschooling, is the structure (whether it&#39;s 2% or <br/>
50%) I think it&#39;s a kindness for us to refer them to eclectic sites or lists <br/>
where they can find people who will welcome them warmly and offer them all <br/>
kinds of ideas where they can blend structure with inquiry and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than try to bend the definition of mammal to include birds who walk <br/>
instead of fly, they could be given addresses to birds&#39; lists, or a <br/>
flightless birds&#39; list.  They don&#39;t have to drop one list to join another, or <br/>
abandon one website to read others.  Telling them to pluck their feathers out <br/>
and nurse their babies isn&#39;t going to work.  But just pointing out that they <br/>
DO have feathers and that we don&#39;t feed out babies worms doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
rude.  <br/>

I can&#39;t really answer in definites, but I may try both depending on everyone&#39;s preference at that time. If I am not tired, which I usually am not at 10 pm, I probably would rearrange what I was doing. I was maybe I might sit on the couch and read, and when it was time for the oven then get involved... it all would depend.<br/>
