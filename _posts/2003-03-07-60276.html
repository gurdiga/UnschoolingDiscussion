<div id="ygrps-yiv-309183915">Mary/Zenmomma wanted me to tell people she&#39;s having an e-mail problem which <br/>
will be fixed soon, but if you get what seems to be a response to the list <br/>
only it comes to you privately, if you want to, cut and paste it into an <br/>
e-mail to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Forwarding it won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
And if it&#39;s minor don&#39;t worry about it, but if it&#39;s really glorious <br/>
information as some of hers is, send it!!  I don&#39;t want to miss any.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve announced it, it probably won&#39;t happen anymore. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
