&gt; &gt; I agree Tia. But by the same token, so could everyone else who <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to agree completely with this.  When I first got on line, I was a <br/>
new mom who, as a former teacher who knew EVERYTHING about kids before <br/>
becoming a mom, had very different ideas about life and parenting and <br/>
kids than I do now.  I was sometimes on the receiving end of some very <br/>
harsh but valuable words which challenged my thinking and my actions. <br/>
 When I got on line I was going to nurse for one year, but not a day <br/>
longer and by god I would not ever nurse a walking talking toddler or, <br/>
oh my the horror, and OLDER child.  Yep, I ended up eating those words, <br/>
as my oldest nursed until almost six and my five year old, whom I made <br/>
the mistake of calling weaned last year at 4 1/2 still a few times a <br/>
week asks to nurse.  I would never have had an open mind to even <br/>
consider nursing an older child if a few very strong minded and open <br/>
mouthed women (and a few men) had not opened their mouth and sometimes <br/>
strongly helped me to reconsider my ideas and parenting philosophies.  <br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago the idea of unschooling would have been a horrible one for <br/>
me, near child abuse.  Yes, small children can learn their letters and <br/>
such with a hands on gentle approach, but reading needed a direct <br/>
approach, math needed to be taught, year by year, with different skills <br/>
being taught, and then retaught, each year.  I did know one family who <br/>
homeschooled, a very interesting person who had a large number of kids <br/>
in Alb. New Mexico, and she was completely blind.  I really don&#39;t know <br/>
how she homeschooled, but I know I was impressed with her and probably <br/>
just assumed that she schooled at home.  Sandra, wonder if this person <br/>
sounds familiar to you?<br/>
<br/>
10 years ago I would have thought that homeschooling was something only <br/>
a very few could do, probably those with a background in education or a <br/>
masters degree or better, those with very smart children who have no <br/>
difficulties learning--hardly something the average mother or father <br/>
could do.  And I certainly could not have thought, ever, that <br/>
homeschooling might not take place at odd hours, as it does in our <br/>
household--9-3:15, that&#39;s when kids learn!  With a planned scheduled <br/>
lunch and two breaks, morning and afternoon, but the rest of the time <br/>
should be at the kitchen table learning with books and curriculum and <br/>
stuff planned out in advance.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure glad Bonnie was on Parent-L and introduced me to another type <br/>
of learning.  I&#39;m sure glad that Parent-L was around and that I had an <br/>
open mind and that instead of getting all defensive I was able to open <br/>
my mind and think--hey, there is a different way!  Oh wait, I better say <br/>
this or Dar will say it for me, I&#39;m sure--sometimes I did get defensive, <br/>
sometimes I was called on the carpet, sometimes people were, gasp, rough <br/>
with me, a lot straight forward and laying it on the line and <br/>
challenging my beliefs and opinions and ideas and make me think again <br/>
and change those opinions and beliefs and ideas.  All those strong <br/>
Parent-L women, I&#39;m sure they sometimes felt like I would never change <br/>
my ways, but I was open minded enough to think about stuff and figure <br/>
out what was best for my family.  And I have to say that sometimes I <br/>
learned the most during threads where I contributed little or nothing <br/>
but just listened and thought.  <br/>
<br/>
And that is my hope here.  If there is just one one parent out there who <br/>
has been reading this thread and is thinking... then to me it&#39;s worth <br/>
it.  This isn&#39;t about me, it isn&#39;t about Oom or whatever her name is, to <br/>
me part of it is the augumentation skills involved in forming coherent <br/>
thoughts and auguments; and the rest of it is simply an outlet to <br/>
express my belief, but if one person gets something from this, then <br/>
that&#39;s even better.<br/>
<br/>
but I do love a good debate.  <br/>
<br/>
Joylyn, whose 8 year old was watching Peter Pan II yesterday and said, <br/>
to my amusement, &quot;MOM, that is SO TOTALLY Historically Inaccurate!&quot;  No <br/>
doubt, but still, child, it&#39;s a CARTOON!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031020997">Yes, Kathy sounds right, but again this was 10 years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Sure, track them down. I wonder if they remember me.  I wonder if she <br/>
realizes what a difference she made in my thinking, it was the <br/>
beginning.  Before that point I didn&#39;t even know homeschooling was <br/>
possible.  I knew one of her younger sons, who was about 6 or so at the <br/>
time, in 1991 or so.<br/>
