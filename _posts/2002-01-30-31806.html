<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674071518">Speaking of sleep.....I noticed the discussion on allowing children to<br/>
determine bedtimes, etc.  A few years back,  I attended a wonderful<br/>
presentation by the director of the big Sleep Clinic in Cincinnati...can&#39;t<br/>
think of his name.<br/>
    The seminar and presentation were terrific.  He talked about &quot;sleep<br/>
hygiene&quot; and its importance to our general health and well-being.<br/>
    I&#39;ve been pondering this in relation to unschooling.  I have one child<br/>
has always been sensitive to her tiredness signals,  and respects them by<br/>
napping or going to bed.  The other 3 are have what I call<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t-want-to-miss-anything&quot; syndrome....and get,  well, unpleasant when<br/>
overtired.<br/>
    I&#39;m a firm believer in respecting a body&#39;s sleep needs and that getting<br/>
enpugh sleep can help with many other &#39;problems&#39;....and that most people in<br/>
our society are not getting enough quality sleep.<br/>
    Anybody&#39;s thoughts?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; HI!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You asked about examples of what the moderators did on the other list<br/>
about meta discussions.  It would go something like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; * poster explains an idea or question<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *bunch of posts come up to answer question, or give other ideas<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *someone writes something like &quot;your reply to my post was snippy, all I<br/>
meant was ...&quot; or &quot;I take offense at your tone&quot;, or &quot;I was hurt because you<br/>
seemed to dismiss me in your post&quot;- these are all examples of writing *about<br/>
the writing*.  the &quot;style&quot; of the post, the &quot;rudeness&quot; or whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *moderator would immediately post a reminder that the list has a no meta<br/>
discussion policy...  messages of that nature can be e-mailed privately...<br/>
e-mail the moderator if you have questions..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ANyway, I appreciated it because it did help us remember what you said<br/>
below- because this isnt the forum for bashing eachothers writing- it kept<br/>
us focused on sharing our ideas and giving the benefit of the doubt to those<br/>
posting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is interesting, because in our homeschooling group this kind of came<br/>
up.  I had been instramental in the formulating of a &quot;conflict resolution&quot;<br/>
policy for the group.   The first rule was that if you had a &quot;problem&quot; or<br/>
&quot;conflict&quot; with someone (no matter what age) your first step is to approach<br/>
that person individually with your feelings.  There is more..but anyway, a<br/>
big disgusting &quot;thing&quot; happened because certain &quot;adults&quot; in the group didnt<br/>
follow the policy- and it could have ALL been avoided.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this relates I think because for one, when you know you must<br/>
personally discuss things you have a problem with, they dont seem to be that<br/>
much of a problem-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; VERY much easier to sort of just yell out into cyber space &quot;I was dissed!&quot;<br/>
or talk in a private meeting with sympathisers about how &quot;awful&quot; the other<br/>
person is and how they think- when you havent even spoke to the person and<br/>
dont really understand them at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keeps you honest, &quot;professional&quot;, keeps you thinking about and processing<br/>
what others say instead of lashing out- because if you are going to post<br/>
something, it has to relate to the actual discussion.  There is no doubt<br/>
that things still get heated- but they generally dont get into the personal<br/>
attack realm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ANyway- there you go,<br/>
&gt; Bronwen<br/>

&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kindness and META discussions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   For the first time I&#39;m not going to quote anyone ;-) Because it applies<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   everyone. Undoubtedly even me too! ;-) And I don&#39;t want to single anyone<br/>
&gt;   out. Or leave anyone feeling off the hook.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ve been mulling over Bronwen&#39;s idea of no META discussions. I thought<br/>
&gt;   perhaps it would put a gag on discussions. But now I do notice a pattern<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   the events leading up to a fight and it does seem to be discussions of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;   discussion. For example:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1) Someone takes exception to the way something is expressed or someone<br/>
&gt;   takes exception to the boundaries someone sets (eg, that&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   2) The poster defends herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   3) Others polarize into camps to defend the poster or the person who<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt;   attacked or the style of posting or what is and isn&#39;t rudeness and so<br/>
forth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Bronwen, can you tell us more about the policy? Do you have some of the<br/>
&gt;   email reminders that the moderators used or addresses where we can write<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   ask them for examples they&#39;ve used?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The first step is &quot;we&quot; need to let go of the idea of there being a &quot;we&quot;<br/>
&gt;   here. &quot;We&quot; can&#39;t be kinder or blunter or more probing or huggier because<br/>
&gt;   &quot;we&quot; are a collection of always changing individuals. Each of us<br/>
deserves<br/>
&gt;   *trust* that she&#39;s communicating the way *she* feels is best, and<br/>
*trust*<br/>
&gt;   that if she doesn&#39;t feel she&#39;s acheiving *her own* goals of<br/>
communication<br/>
&gt;   (*whatever* they may be and *regardless* of what others think her goals<br/>
&gt;   *should* be) that she will learn from her mistakes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   If some of us want a kinder list then the only way to acheive that is to<br/>
&gt;   *set an example*, *be* the tone of kindness, *NOT* the enforcer of a<br/>
certain<br/>
&gt;   standard of kindness. To be kind we can police our own selves *not* each<br/>
&gt;   other. We can&#39;t even police others who we feel aren&#39;t policing<br/>
themselves<br/>
&gt;   properly. (Shades of fundamentalism!) We have to *trust* that they can<br/>
read<br/>
&gt;   the moderator reminders as well as we can and can interpret them --<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt;   differently! -- but as well as we can. If we feel someone&#39;s being rude,<br/>
*let<br/>
&gt;   it go*. (Talk to the moderators. Let the moderators handle it. If<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt;   doesn&#39;t like the way the moderators are handling something then they can<br/>
&gt;   read any policies we come up with and discuss the *policies* not a<br/>
&gt;   particular poster.) We don&#39;t set an example of kindness by reprimanding<br/>
&gt;   those we feel are unkind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   (Same with wanting a blunter list or more challenging list. We need to<br/>
&gt;   accept that not everyone likes blunt or probing or probing of newbies or<br/>
&gt;   whatever. If &quot;this list&quot; is less challenging than before is it the fault<br/>
of<br/>
&gt;   those who are responding the way *they* feel best or the fault of those<br/>
who<br/>
&gt;   *aren&#39;t* responding in ways they feel best? We need to *let go* of the<br/>
idea<br/>
&gt;   that the &quot;best way&quot; to help people get unschooling is to get them to<br/>
examine<br/>
&gt;   themselves. (Yes, even I&#39;ll have to let go of that! ;-) Some people feel<br/>
&gt;   it&#39;s best to lead gently. *They&#39;re entitled to that opinion* and<br/>
entitled to<br/>
&gt;   lead gently. Some people do want to be led gently. They&#39;re entitled to<br/>
go at<br/>
&gt;   the pace *they* feel is best. We have to *let it go* even if we don&#39;t<br/>
think<br/>
&gt;   the questioner is choosing what they need. It isn&#39;t unschooling to<br/>
decide<br/>
&gt;   that someone needs blunt questioning or self-examination. -- Or decide<br/>
they<br/>
&gt;   need gently led either! -- We have to trust that people coming here can<br/>
pick<br/>
&gt;   and choose from the approaches they&#39;re offered. Sometimes they *will*<br/>
get<br/>
&gt;   offended since some newbies will expect only gentle and I think it&#39;s up<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   the moderators to send out an email about different posting styles and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;   problems of interpretation of emails.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Though I can bet &quot;we&quot; will generally agree that &quot;You&#39;re a sh*thead!&quot; is<br/>
out<br/>
&gt;   of the realm of polite, each of us as individuals *will* have different<br/>
&gt;   ideas of what is and isn&#39;t polite or what is and isn&#39;t necessary to<br/>
discuss<br/>
&gt;   unschooling. And those levels will push other people&#39;s buttons.<br/>
Especially,<br/>
&gt;   unfortunately, newbies. Some people (the poster it&#39;s directed at or<br/>
&gt;   bystanders) *will* feel &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling&quot; or &quot;Why do you think<br/>
that?&quot;<br/>
&gt;   is rude or unkind. We need to *trust* that the poster&#39;s intentions are<br/>
*not*<br/>
&gt;   unkindness and they are doing what they feel is best.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think, as a policy, it&#39;s best that if someone, even when it happens to<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;   newbie, has issue with the way someone has worded something, then it<br/>
should<br/>
&gt;   remain between the two posters. No one jump in to defend the newbie, the<br/>
&gt;   poster or the style of posting. If someone sees a problem, then alert a<br/>
&gt;   moderator. (Perhaps moderator email addresses should be included in the<br/>
&gt;   footer attached to posts.) And, as Bronwen said was done on the other<br/>
list,<br/>
&gt;   as soon as someone says they don&#39;t like the way something is worded, the<br/>
&gt;   moderators need to send out a private email and/or emails to the list<br/>
&gt;   depending on their discretion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   *Perhaps* one problem with no META discussions is how can the list<br/>
discuss<br/>
&gt;   policy? I *don&#39;t* think setting policy is up to the moderators. I think<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   up to the users to decide and the moderators to act as reminders (and<br/>
&gt;   perhaps enforcers if it comes to that) of the *list&#39;s* wishes. (Or<br/>
Helen&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   wishes of course! But she seems to be of the policy that we can manage<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   create what we need, not rely on her to create what she thinks we need.<br/>
&gt;   She&#39;s an unschooling kind of lady! :-) Perhaps if we want to discuss<br/>
changes<br/>
&gt;   in policy, we can write &quot;Policy discussion&quot; in the title of the post.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Another problem I do see is that some discussions revolve around what is<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   isn&#39;t unschooling and whether unschooling should be defined or not.<br/>
Being<br/>
&gt;   firmly in the camp that the definition or unschooling can&#39;t be watered<br/>
down<br/>
&gt;   or it will become synonymous with &quot;do whatever&#39;s best for your family&quot;,<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   really hard for me to say that we need to let the newbies come in, hear<br/>
both<br/>
&gt;   *positions* in the argument and then decide for themselves.  I think<br/>
there<br/>
&gt;   is something valuable in discussing the *idea* of whether unschooling<br/>
should<br/>
&gt;   be defined or not or whether defining it is limiting or clarifying, so<br/>
I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   not sure how such discussions can be allowed and still maintain a META<br/>
&gt;   policy. I think I need to think on that some more to see if I&#39;m being<br/>
&gt;   objective enough or not ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So perhaps the moderators can have a few email reminders in their tool<br/>
bag:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1) No META discussions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   2) Definitions of unschooling (and perhaps some attitudes about defining<br/>
&gt;   unschooling.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   3) The problems of interpretation of emails and why it&#39;s a policy that<br/>
we<br/>
&gt;   assume no ill intent in posts. And then what channels there are for<br/>
&gt;   complaining about a particular poster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Well, I could probably come up some examples of the above to serve as<br/>
&gt;   starting points to be picked over but my daughter is asking for Nancy<br/>
Drew<br/>
&gt;   to be read and I&#39;ve already been at this post for 2 hours so the<br/>
examples<br/>
&gt;   will have to wait. ;-)<br/>

&gt; Me:  I do see that there could be a strong correlation, but the rest<br/>
&gt; of your post clearly shows that there is a process involved. You<br/>
&gt; spend time talking to your children and examining their decisions<br/>
&gt; without forcing or coercing them to do what you think is best.  Their<br/>
&gt; decision making abilities didn&#39;t develop in a vacuum simply because<br/>
&gt; they are unschooled.  Your parenting style appears to be a great<br/>
&gt; influence, and, from reading the messages here, I&#39;m starting to see<br/>
&gt; that one&#39;s parenting style cannot be divorced from unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My two oldest children, by contrast, haven&#39;t been unschooled, but my<br/>
&gt; 12yo daughter makes very responsible, classy choices for herself most<br/>
&gt; of the time as well.  This I attribute to my parenting style and her<br/>
&gt; personality bent. My 12 yo son, on the other hand, does not make<br/>
&gt; decisions that are in his best interest.  His decisions have been a<br/>
&gt; threat to his own safety and the safety of others, at times.  Like<br/>
&gt; you and your son, we spend a great deal of time talking him through<br/>
&gt; the cause and effect of his actions, but he often doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;<br/>
&gt; until he has experienced a consequence that is painful for him. He<br/>
&gt; has been this way since birth, it seems. Would unschooling/NCP change<br/>
&gt; his personality bent,I wonder?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am definitely not okay w/the idea of my kid not being able to read at<br/>
&gt; &gt;16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>
&gt; &gt;is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and<br/>
sound<br/>
&gt; &gt;games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt;start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but<br/>
certainly<br/>
&gt; &gt;by 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>
&gt; &gt;that he has to learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Been there.  Done that.  It just slowed down his process of learning to<br/>
&gt; read.  And damaged our relationship to boot.  I honestly think he would<br/>
&gt; have read sooner and better if I&#39;d left him alone about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also believe that there have always been and always will be some people<br/>
&gt; who just aren&#39;t academically inclined, people who will always learn in<br/>
&gt; other ways than reading.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to push these kids into<br/>
&gt; an academic mold when they could well be the person who invents something<br/>
&gt; really useful to our society or something.  Edison eventually learned to<br/>
&gt; read.  If he&#39;d been made to stay in school and learn academics, we would<br/>
&gt; probably have missed out on a lot of useful inventions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is able to read what he *has* to, though slowly.  I think his<br/>
&gt; reading will still improve by the time he&#39;s ready to leave home, but if it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s still going to be ok.<br/>

&gt; Perhaps I misunderstand, but it seems you are saying that you pay your<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; money to do workbooks.  That coupled with the information you posted about<br/>
&gt; unschooling at home while your kids were in ps, leads me to question your<br/>
&gt; understanding of unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling isn&#39;t something done part time or occasionally.  It is 24/7 of<br/>
&gt; the child pursuing his own dreams and desires, not completing pages to get<br/>
&gt; money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, perhaps I misunderstood.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s been quite the opposite experience w/us. Our reading &quot;lessons&quot; are<br/>

&gt; big love for books and that&#39;s why I guess he&#39;s so motivated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I honestly think have read sooner and better if I&#39;d left him alone about<br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re probably right, and I&#39;m glad you are taking a more laid back<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll give you an example from home.  Rachel has depression problems<br/>
&gt; and is on Prozac.  She knows she feels better when her sleep schedule<br/>
&gt; is patterned so that she is up during the day.  She also knows that<br/>
&gt; if she hangs out on the computer at night starts watching tv at<br/>
&gt; night, she will be up all night.  It&#39;s a pattern, she knows it, I<br/>
&gt; know it, we all know it.  The last time she got into a bad pattern,<br/>
&gt; she wuld get royally mad if we left the house without her.  We had<br/>
&gt; numerous discussions about the fact that it is like waking the dead<br/>
&gt; to get her up and we would give her one wake-up call and then be on<br/>
&gt; our way from then on.  She now understands it is her decision to get<br/>
&gt; out of or stay in bed and has stopped going off on us if we leave<br/>
&gt; without her.<br/>
&gt; In other words, it&#39;s her choice.  It does not matter if I want her up<br/>
&gt; in the morning or not.  But she had to learn to live peacefully with<br/>
&gt; the consequences too.  When she was going off on us for leaving her<br/>
&gt; at home, I started making her get up when we went out.  When she<br/>
&gt; decided to stop getting mad at us, I started leaving her alone.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;Work&#39; in the meaning that I wrote it is to be defined as &#39;not always<br/>
&gt; taking the easier/faster way out&#39; of a situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is most likely more physical when they are young, and more mental<br/>
&gt; when they are older.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example: You got a load of laundry to fold. Your two year old wants<br/>
&gt; to help (at that age they all want to help!). It would, of course, be<br/>
&gt; faster if you did it yourself. But if you let your child help it, it will<br/>
&gt; be more work for you to &#39;refold&#39; and to find the ones they walked away<br/>
&gt; with. But the lesson to them is worth your time and energy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As they get older, this can mean something like &#39;biting your tongue&#39; when<br/>
&gt; you pass by a messy bedroom for the 6th month in a row. Until eventually<br/>
&gt; they pull it together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Control and rewards are by far easier for getting the desired results<br/>
&gt; that a PARENT has in mind. But they aren&#39;t the best results for a person<br/>
&gt; to become a self-assured adult.<br/>

&gt; Dorinda -- i most heartily apologize if you were not pulling this<br/>

&gt; My son was just the same way, only he never asked for phonics and never<br/>

&gt; himself yet.  If your son asked for phonics and reading games, great.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just that you said (I think it was you, could be wrong) there was an age<br/>
&gt; beyond which you *would* force the issue.  That age for me was 12.  And it<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am new here but not to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have done it since birth even when the kids were in PS we<br/>
&gt; unschooled at<br/>
&gt; &gt; home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades<br/>
&gt; higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Andrew our oldest (15 in March) is learning disabled and unschooled<br/>
&gt; himself<br/>
&gt; &gt; how to read with the Goosebumps books.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lin III (12 next week) Is the one testing above grade level. Is<br/>
&gt; working on<br/>
&gt; &gt; his Highschool Credits.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Felicia (just turned 10 in August) is having trouble with<br/>
&gt; multiplication and<br/>
&gt; &gt; division.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We use a geosafari which I make my own cards to fit subjects they<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; working on in there unschooling. I also make File folder games for<br/>
&gt; them.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; they play the games great If the don&#39;t oh well ant any rate I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; somethiong to show nosy people who claim my kids do nothing all<br/>
&gt; day. :-))<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have gotten really good at record keeping! My children had<br/>
&gt; homebased head<br/>
&gt; &gt; start which trains parents to look at all the activities that there<br/>
&gt; kids are<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing and pick out the educational content. I would reccomend it to<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; who has toddlers 3-5 that plans on unschooling. They have a really<br/>
&gt; nice form<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you fill out. or at least they did wghen my kids were there. I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; blank forms for elementary school in Maine that I made at my web<br/>
&gt; site.<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://www.angelfire.com/me3/dorioakes/Homeschooling.html<br/>
&gt; &gt; My highschool form might be there too by the end of the week. If<br/>
&gt; you want me<br/>
&gt; &gt; to upload a scanned immage of how it looks for Felicia Let me know.<br/>
&gt; I can do<br/>
&gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We also use computer curriculum of Jumpstart, Cornerstone Home, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cluefinders. The kids only play them when they want to and what<br/>
&gt; ever grade<br/>
&gt; &gt; they want to.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We use workbooks too only they are used to earn money or other<br/>
&gt; rewards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; After all who goes to work (except homeschooling Mom&#39;s) without<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt; financially rewarded?????<br/>

&gt; I have to apologize for thinking you were joking, Dorinda. I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; away from unschooling message boards and lists for several months<br/>
&gt; now. I was completely clueless about the changes on this board. These<br/>
&gt; days when people say that they are unschoolers, it could mean<br/>
&gt; different things, i guess. Our unschooling looks really different<br/>
&gt; from your unschooling. I admit to being somewhat confused. Did I fall<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is really more of a message to others with the same fears, rather<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; directed at you, Lynn. More a discussion of the *idea* of delayed reading<br/>
&gt; being equated with illiteracy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *If* someone wanted to get past the fear that their child wouldn&#39;t read if<br/>
&gt; they waited too long, there are *plenty* of stories, particularly at<br/>
&gt; Unschooling.com, that can assure people that if the printed word is a fun,<br/>
&gt; useful part of their lives that they will read when they&#39;re<br/>
developmentally<br/>
&gt; ready. We get filled up with too many scary stories of kids hitting 16 and<br/>
&gt; being illiterate, and the *cause* that&#39;s pointed to is because the school<br/>
&gt; failed them, because it didn&#39;t have the proper programs at the proper<br/>
time.<br/>
&gt; But it just isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s because of the pressure to read by a certain<br/>
&gt; age (4th grade), the stigma of being singled out because you can&#39;t do what<br/>
&gt; &quot;everyone&quot; else can, the tedium of being forced to do something you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to do yet and have no interest in. When that environment is removed,<br/>
&gt; kids *do* (honestly! :-) learn to read when they are developmentally ready<br/>
&gt; and they feel reading is worthwhile to *them*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; School and society fill us with so many certainties about how children<br/>
learn<br/>
&gt; but that really just aren&#39;t true outside the setting of school.<br/>

&gt; I suspect what you did was enrich their learning with fun activities.<br/>
&gt; Nothing wrong with that! Sounds like fun! This is not to say you need to<br/>
&gt; change anything about what you&#39;re doing. Only to gently suggest that if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re looking for ideas to make things kids need to know fun, you&#39;ll find<br/>
&gt; the offerings on this list slim in that area. If, on the otherhand, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; trying to feel more comfortable that living is learning, trying to let go<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; levels and the idea that some things are necessary to learn, then there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lots of helpful advice here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t have anything to do with learning what everyone is<br/>
&gt; certain everyone needs to know. Unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>
&gt; kids need to multiply or learn geography or history or grammar or how to<br/>
&gt; write. Those things *will* be part of their lives and kids *will* reach a<br/>
&gt; level of competence that is useful to them. Books will be set in real<br/>
&gt; locations, games will be played that need arithmetic to be better at,<br/>
&gt; message boards will have messages that kids will want to respond to. (Or<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; if their interests lie elsewhere.) The concept of unschooling is that,<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; as they took what path they found most useful for their own needs in<br/>
&gt; learning to speak (talking about dinosaurs or poop or Teletubbies), kids<br/>
&gt; will acquire what they need as adults by exploring the paths of their<br/>
&gt; interests. Whatever level of geography (or whatever) they acquire<br/>
naturally<br/>
&gt; through living -- and continue acquiring through  out their lives -- is<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; level that they will need as adults. *If* they need a higher level for<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; purpose that suddenly strikes them, they will either set about acquiring<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; because they know they can learn whatever they set out to learn, or they<br/>
&gt; will have already acquired it because it&#39;s part of the things they are<br/>
&gt; naturally drawn to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades higher<br/>
&gt; &gt; than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In unschooling there are no grades or placements. Unschooled kids are<br/>
where<br/>
&gt; they are according to their own needs, not some standard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Felicia (just turned 10 in August) is having trouble with multiplication<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; division.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because she has a need in her right now life for multiplication and<br/>
division<br/>
&gt; (a job? love of a particular game or type of puzzle?) and she isn&#39;t up to<br/>
&gt; doing what she feels she needs? Or because she&#39;s not performing at some<br/>
&gt; grade-level standard?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, this is not saying what you&#39;re doing is wrong, only that if you<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; ideas on doing more of the same, other lists (like one that deals with<br/>
&gt; eclectic homeschooling) will have *way* more ideas for you than this one.<br/>

&gt; I care. And I can give you reasons why I care. The reasons aren&#39;t intended<br/>
&gt; to convince anyone that I&#39;m right and someone else is wrong. The reasons<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; an explanation of why I do what I do. Everyone has their own reasons for<br/>
&gt; doing what they do and feeling what they feel. I think we&#39;re each entitled<br/>
&gt; to act as we feel is best to achieve the goals *we* feel are important.<br/>
One<br/>
&gt; of my goals is to help keep the definition of unschooling clear because<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; important *to me*. (Another is to help newbies who are in a quandry to see<br/>
&gt; the illusory barriers in their thinking set up by society that keeps them<br/>
&gt; from seeing the true nature of the problems they&#39;re facing.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If the term gets &quot;watered down,&quot; so what.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *My* reasons for caring whether it gets watered down or not is that for<br/>
&gt; those *who do* want to let go entirely, there needs to be a clear goal to<br/>
&gt; reach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless there are people -- and I don&#39;t mean everyone needs to do this --<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; people who do speak up and say &quot;*This* is unschooling&quot; and people who<br/>
&gt; believe with all their hearts that &quot;*This* place has benefits that that<br/>
&gt; place doesn&#39;t have&quot; and speak their minds on it, then many people who<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; have gone farther had they only known will stop at their comfort level<br/>
&gt; believing there are no greater benefits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It *seems* like just living unschooling and showing people unschooling<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; let them understand unschooling without defining it. After all a child<br/>
&gt; unschools exactly like that. He follows the path that leads to *his* goal.<br/>
&gt; He isn&#39;t seeking out a path that leads to someone&#39;s definition of &quot;Jimmy&#39;s<br/>
&gt; goal in life&quot;. He&#39;s setting his own goal and taking his own path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, though that may be the *method* of unschooling, the *philosophy* of<br/>
&gt; unschooling *isn&#39;t* whatever goal that a family decides suits their family<br/>
&gt; best. It *is* a very definite definible goal and helping people reach<br/>
*that<br/>
&gt; particular* goal is different than helping them reach whatever goal they<br/>
&gt; feel comfortable with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But just because I want to keep the definition of unschooling clear<br/>
&gt; *doesn&#39;t* mean I advocate jumping all over newbies who are unclear on the<br/>
&gt; concept and try to brow beat them into accepting my definition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *How* somenoe handles statements they disagree with is an entirely<br/>
separate<br/>
&gt; issue from *why* they do so. They may seem connected, but they *are*<br/>
&gt; separate.<br/>

&gt; this?&quot; But that&#39;s losing sight of what the true nature of the problem is.<br/>
&gt; The problem *isn&#39;t* that someone chooses to communicate in a way he has<br/>
&gt; gotten positive feed back on, but that others decide that he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; communicate that way because some don&#39;t like it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sometimes find it helpful to turn a question around and use it on<br/>
&gt; something I agree with to see if it fits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone were asking the Dalai Lama questions about Buddhism and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like his gentle, seek inside yourself answers (or whatever style he&#39;d<br/>
use),<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the Dalai Lama entitled to feel that the method he uses to help<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; on the path to enlightenment best? If he thought some other way were<br/>
better,<br/>
&gt; then wouldn&#39;t he use it? Or, at least, he employs his skills in the way he<br/>
&gt; feels he&#39;s best at. If a fair number of people wanted a more direct (or<br/>
&gt; whatever) style, does he have an obligation to change to meet their needs?<br/>
&gt; Should he compromise the method he feels is best in order to meet the<br/>
needs<br/>
&gt; of more people or compromise meeting more people&#39;s needs so he can meet<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; needs of those who seek the style he feels he&#39;s best at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe that&#39;s hard to see. It&#39;s hard to get past the idea that someone<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be irritating other people. If someone were *only* irritating<br/>
&gt; people, then people certainly have a right to speak up. If someone is<br/>
&gt; speaking in a way that *some* find irritating and *some* find helpful --<br/>
&gt; *not* helpful because they enjoy being irritated but because they find<br/>
&gt; something in the style illuminating -- then the problem *isn&#39;t* how to<br/>
&gt; silence that person so no one gets irritated, but to create an environment<br/>
&gt; where that style *and* other styles can co-exist so that those who come<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; can have a *choice*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps all it will take is an email reminder posted to the list that<br/>
&gt; different people have different styles of communicating, or some such<br/>
&gt; wording.<br/>

&gt; ***Is it acceptable to become an adult in our society who just doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; read? Would you want to allow your kid to go out into the world so<br/>
&gt; &gt; unprepared? Aren&#39;t you worried they&#39;ll be taken advantage of, or be<br/>
unable<br/>
&gt; &gt; to negotiate contracts/instructions/newspapers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am definitely not okay w/the idea of my kid not being able to read at<br/>
&gt; 16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>
&gt; is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and<br/>
sound<br/>
&gt; games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but certainly<br/>
&gt; by 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>
&gt; that he has to learn. Years ago, it was illegal for my ancestors to learn<br/>
&gt; how to read (we are African American) in this country. I feel it would be<br/>
&gt; a slap in the face for all their struggles for me to neglect this one<br/>
&gt; aspect of his upbringing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best,<br/>
&gt; Lynn***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now this is the kind of thinking that just begs for a response along the<br/>
&gt; lines of unschooling!  I&#39;ll just ask,  Lynn,  you&#39;re willing to give up<br/>
&gt; unschooling if your child can&#39;t read by age 10?  I&#39;m wondering whether you<br/>
&gt; fully understand it then.  And I won&#39;t speak for Tia,  but she has<br/>
commented<br/>
&gt; many times that her experience of intervening with her son seemed to make<br/>
&gt; things worse in their relationship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I truly understand your dilemma,  for I have experienced what you are<br/>
simply<br/>
&gt; talking about as a possible situation.  Let me share a bit of my<br/>
experience.<br/>
&gt; Since we moved away from the school track for our family (my oldest had<br/>
&gt; attended kindergarten and two yrs of preschool),  I explored aspects of<br/>
&gt; educating our children at home and found that unschooling resonated as the<br/>
&gt; most genuine way to allow my children to grow.<br/>
&gt;     When my very intelligent dd wasn&#39;t reading by the end of &#39;first<br/>
grade&#39;,<br/>
&gt; I worried.  She had even forgotten the sight words she had memorized in<br/>
&gt; kindergarten.  All the veteran homeschoolers advised me to take a deep<br/>
breat<br/>
&gt; h and be patient.  I had to trusyt a bunch of people I&#39;d never met in<br/>
&gt; person?  Well,  I did.  For several months.  And as dd did NOT &#39;take off&#39;<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; her reading,  my patience left me.  I once again struggled to &#39;let go.  A<br/>
&gt; discussion came up here ...about whether or not it&#39;s ok for a parent to<br/>
&gt; &#39;just let them grow up illiterate&#39;.  But again,  the those who had older<br/>
&gt; children,  children who learned to read &#39;later&#39;,  others coping with the<br/>
&gt; same circumstance all recommended being patient.   I went up and down this<br/>
&gt; roller coaster....though the hills and valleys became less and less<br/>
&gt; pronounced.<br/>
&gt;     Finally,  about a year ago,  I *truly got it*!!!  I had *really*<br/>
missed<br/>
&gt; the point of unschooling in regard to reading!  All along,  I was pushing<br/>
dd<br/>
&gt; into word games, shaming her at times (I didn&#39;t consciously intend to...I<br/>
&gt; was ashamed it camed out that way).  In my roller coaster ride,  I was<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; pushing her...only it became more subtle usually.  Or I&#39;d think...ok,<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been patient for 6-7 months,  and that hasn&#39;t &#39;worked&#39; (meaning it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get me what *I* wanted - her to read AND enjoy it!)<br/>
&gt;     Intead of allowing her the freedom to learn when,  how,  as much as<br/>
SHE<br/>
&gt; chose,  I was trying to get her to meet MY expectations.  When she was 8,<br/>
&gt; dh and I even devised a *plan* to have her tested if she couldn&#39;t read by<br/>
&gt; age 9.  Then it was,  we&#39;ll start a stringent structured program by age 9;<br/>
&gt; then it was....maybe I&#39;m not handling this right,  maybe we should pay a<br/>
&gt; tutor.  Well, all this didn&#39;t settle well with me.  And whenever it came<br/>
up,<br/>
&gt; dd felt like she had disappointed me,  like a failure.  She was stressed<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; tense about reading and &#39;tried&#39; to do it for me....yet became increasingly<br/>
&gt; resistant.<br/>
&gt;     When I examined this situation more closely,  I realized I had some<br/>
&gt; major de-schooling to do of my own thinking.  I had to examine how<br/>
&gt; mainstream ideas had infiltrated my thinking about how it&#39;s my *job* to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; sure she knows certain things.<br/>
&gt;     And your post almost exactly states my thinking on it.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll not be able to understand unless you go through it.  But I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; wrong in my attitude and it only harmed my dd.  She was not truly allowed<br/>
&gt; the freedom she neede in this area (i.e., NOT unschooling) until I had<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; breakthrough in my thinking and attitude.<br/>
&gt;     I need to go now......I hope you can look at this with an open mind!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651248579">Our experiences with sleep predate our unschooling.   When the kids were <br/>
babies I&#39;d nurse them to sleep and stay with them or in the next room, and if one <br/>
woke up I&#39;d go in and carry him or nurse him or rock him.   I never &quot;put them <br/>
down for naps,&quot; and my friends who did that, who scheduled hours of dark and <br/>
quiet and tried to &quot;train them&quot; to sleep seemed even in that first year or two <br/>
to be less connected to their babies than I wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was old enough to say he wasn&#39;t sleepy, when I was really sleepy, <br/>
there were a couple of things I&#39;d do.   Sometimes I would put on a cassette <br/>
tape and ask him to just listen to it until it ended, and then if he was still <br/>
awake he could wake me up.    Maybe twice he lasted through, but dozens of <br/>
times he&#39;d fall asleep before it was over.    The other thing was if he woke up in <br/>
the middle of the night and I wasn&#39;t able to wake up enough to be with him, <br/>
I&#39;d set him up with finger food and a sippy cup in a high chair with a long <br/>
videotape, and a little blanket, and he would either eat and drink and watch <br/>
until I woke up, or more often would put the blanket down as a pillow and fall <br/>
asleep.<br/>
<br/>
We were in a small house then, and we could hear each other speak in normal <br/>
voices, and at night when it was quiet we could hear each other breathe.   In <br/>
the big house we&#39;re in now, that wouldn&#39;t have worked as well.   But what I <br/>
have done here, though Holly was turning six when we moved here, was to lie down <br/>
on the couch in the den, with her on a futon on the floor watching a movie to <br/>
which she would fall asleep.   I was still asleep, but she wasn&#39;t alone.   <br/>
<br/>
Just last week we played a verson of that.   Holly wanted to watch a movie <br/>
with me.   I&#39;d already watched it earlier, and told her I might fall asleep.   <br/>
She said okay.   I was in a recliner and was awake enough that if she said <br/>
something I could respond, and I as trying to keep track of where we were in the <br/>
movie a little, but mostly I slept.   When it was over we both went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
To tell a child &quot;If you don&#39;t sleep eight hours you&#39;ll be grumpy&quot; is the same <br/>
as saying &quot;if you eat too much candy you&#39;ll get sick.&quot;     You risk flatly <br/>
telling a lie.   It&#39;s threat for the purpose of control.   It&#39;s working on the <br/>
assumption that what a mother says is truth because she&#39;s a mother and that&#39;s a <br/>
dangerous thought to think.   Partly we think it in justification of our own <br/>
mothers and grandmothers.   &quot;Why would she have said it 200 times if there&#39;s <br/>
no truth to it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To be mindful we need to consider each thing we do in its own immediate <br/>
light.   It&#39;s worth reminding children of scheduled activities the next day, but to <br/>
try to *make* them sleep eight hours before is likely to cause agitation and <br/>
stress, and people do NOT fall asleep when they&#39;re stressed and agitated. Five <br/>
or six hours of peaceful, gentle sleep is WAY way better than eight hours of <br/>
being in the bed feeling unloved and controlled and ashamed.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 19, 16, and 13.   Recently, Marty has been going to sleep the <br/>
earliest.   If he has to go to work the next day, he&#39;s usually asleep by midnight <br/>
or 1:00.   He works from noon to five.   When he&#39;s not going to work, he <br/>
might be up later with friends, either online or out at an allnight resaurant or <br/>
Walmart.    Kirby works at 11:00 each weekday.   He doesn&#39;t need as much sleep <br/>
as Marty.   He gets himself up and gets there on time.   Holly has had the <br/>
most erratic schedule lately.   Now that school has started it&#39;s getting more <br/>
regular, because the kids she plays Halo II   can&#39;t stay up so late on school <br/>
nights, so the school schedules of kids in other parts of the country are <br/>
affecting her at our house.   That&#39;s interesting.   But after they&#39;ve gone to bed and <br/>
Kirby wants to go to sleep (the XBox is in his room), she sometimes stays up <br/>
later on the computer, chatting with some of the kids she met at HesFes, and <br/>
their friends, before they go to school in the morning, or later if it&#39;s not a <br/>
schoolday.   Some days, lately, Holly sleeps until late afternoon.   Sometimes <br/>
she sets an alarm for noon or 1:00 and asks me to make sure she gets up.<br/>
<br/>
When there&#39;s a reason to get up, they set an alarm and get up cheerfully.   <br/>
When being asleep seems better than being awake, they go to bed.   Because <br/>
they&#39;ve done it all their lives, I&#39;m less concerned about it, and they&#39;re   less <br/>
likely to stay up just for the sake of staying up than might happen in families <br/>
new to the idea. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no good reason to jump straight to a different way of being, when it <br/>
can be done gradually.   Lots of little &quot;yesses&quot; are better than one giant &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t care anymore,&quot; in lots of ways.    Better with food, better with sleep, <br/>
better with choices.   Maybe even better with a curriculum, if the parents are <br/>
undecided.   Rather than &quot;try unschooling&quot; and fail from lack of <br/>
understanding or desire, might it be better if they just don&#39;t make kids start their work <br/>
or finish it, and let it peter out with all of them seeing the lack of <br/>
importance of it, and seeing the kids learn more happily other ways?   I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
 Never had to learn that one.<br/>

I like this Sandra. I don&#39;t post often, but I have been reading for years. <br/>
We started out with public school.<br/>
3.5  years ago I brought my 7 year old daughter home, just this past year <br/>
one of her older brothers decided to join us, and all of the younger <br/>
children (now 8,6,3,and 8 months) have never been to school. I have always <br/>
been what&#39;s coined an &quot;Attachement Parent&quot; but school always just seemed <br/>
like what you had to do.  I&#39;ve learned so much over the years through some <br/>
great books, message boards, and discussion lists etc. We still use a math <br/>
curriculum, and a bit of &quot;scheduled&quot; reading but that&#39;s a far way from where <br/>
we use to be, and it works for us. I say &quot;yes&quot; more than I say &quot;no&quot; now, and <br/>
I always think about why I&#39;m going to say &quot;no&quot; if I do. I think that just <br/>
throwing all rules to the wind could be confusing to children and adults <br/>
alike. So we take it slow. The big thing that&#39;s important to me is that I <br/>
have really talked to my kids, as we have slowly made the changes. To me <br/>
what&#39;s most important is that my kids will and do talk to me about their <br/>
lives and their thoughts. We discuss things and our relationships seems real <br/>
and respectful in both directions:-).<br/>

Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] sleep<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Our experiences with sleep predate our unschooling.   When the kids were<br/>
&gt; babies I&#39;d nurse them to sleep and stay with them or in the next room, and <br/>
&gt; if one<br/>
&gt; woke up I&#39;d go in and carry him or nurse him or rock him.   I never &quot;put <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; down for naps,&quot; and my friends who did that, who scheduled hours of dark <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; quiet and tried to &quot;train them&quot; to sleep seemed even in that first year or <br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; to be less connected to their babies than I wanted to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When Kirby was old enough to say he wasn&#39;t sleepy, when I was really <br/>
&gt; sleepy,<br/>
&gt; there were a couple of things I&#39;d do.   Sometimes I would put on a <br/>
&gt; cassette<br/>
&gt; tape and ask him to just listen to it until it ended, and then if he was <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; awake he could wake me up.    Maybe twice he lasted through, but dozens of<br/>
&gt; times he&#39;d fall asleep before it was over.    The other thing was if he <br/>
&gt; woke up in<br/>
&gt; the middle of the night and I wasn&#39;t able to wake up enough to be with <br/>
&gt; him,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d set him up with finger food and a sippy cup in a high chair with a <br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; videotape, and a little blanket, and he would either eat and drink and <br/>
&gt; watch<br/>
&gt; until I woke up, or more often would put the blanket down as a pillow and <br/>
&gt; fall<br/>
&gt; asleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were in a small house then, and we could hear each other speak in <br/>
&gt; normal<br/>
&gt; voices, and at night when it was quiet we could hear each other breathe. <br/>
&gt; In<br/>
&gt; the big house we&#39;re in now, that wouldn&#39;t have worked as well.   But what <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; have done here, though Holly was turning six when we moved here, was to <br/>
&gt; lie down<br/>
&gt; on the couch in the den, with her on a futon on the floor watching a movie <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; which she would fall asleep.   I was still asleep, but she wasn&#39;t alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just last week we played a verson of that.   Holly wanted to watch a movie<br/>
&gt; with me.   I&#39;d already watched it earlier, and told her I might fall <br/>
&gt; asleep.<br/>
&gt; She said okay.   I was in a recliner and was awake enough that if she said<br/>
&gt; something I could respond, and I as trying to keep track of where we were <br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; movie a little, but mostly I slept.   When it was over we both went to <br/>
&gt; bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To tell a child &quot;If you don&#39;t sleep eight hours you&#39;ll be grumpy&quot; is the <br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt; as saying &quot;if you eat too much candy you&#39;ll get sick.&quot;     You risk flatly<br/>
&gt; telling a lie.   It&#39;s threat for the purpose of control.   It&#39;s working on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; assumption that what a mother says is truth because she&#39;s a mother and <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; dangerous thought to think.   Partly we think it in justification of our <br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; mothers and grandmothers.   &quot;Why would she have said it 200 times if <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no truth to it?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To be mindful we need to consider each thing we do in its own immediate<br/>
&gt; light.   It&#39;s worth reminding children of scheduled activities the next <br/>
&gt; day, but to<br/>
&gt; try to *make* them sleep eight hours before is likely to cause agitation <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; stress, and people do NOT fall asleep when they&#39;re stressed and agitated. <br/>
&gt; Five<br/>
&gt; or six hours of peaceful, gentle sleep is WAY way better than eight hours <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; being in the bed feeling unloved and controlled and ashamed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids are 19, 16, and 13.   Recently, Marty has been going to sleep the<br/>
&gt; earliest.   If he has to go to work the next day, he&#39;s usually asleep by <br/>
&gt; midnight<br/>
&gt; or 1:00.   He works from noon to five.   When he&#39;s not going to work, he<br/>
&gt; might be up later with friends, either online or out at an allnight <br/>
&gt; resaurant or<br/>
&gt; Walmart.    Kirby works at 11:00 each weekday.   He doesn&#39;t need as much <br/>
&gt; sleep<br/>
&gt; as Marty.   He gets himself up and gets there on time.   Holly has had the<br/>
&gt; most erratic schedule lately.   Now that school has started it&#39;s getting <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; regular, because the kids she plays Halo II   can&#39;t stay up so late on <br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt; nights, so the school schedules of kids in other parts of the country are<br/>
&gt; affecting her at our house.   That&#39;s interesting.   But after they&#39;ve gone <br/>
&gt; to bed and<br/>
&gt; Kirby wants to go to sleep (the XBox is in his room), she sometimes stays <br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; later on the computer, chatting with some of the kids she met at HesFes, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; their friends, before they go to school in the morning, or later if it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not a<br/>
&gt; schoolday.   Some days, lately, Holly sleeps until late afternoon. <br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt; she sets an alarm for noon or 1:00 and asks me to make sure she gets up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When there&#39;s a reason to get up, they set an alarm and get up cheerfully.<br/>
&gt; When being asleep seems better than being awake, they go to bed.   Because<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve done it all their lives, I&#39;m less concerned about it, and they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; less<br/>
&gt; likely to stay up just for the sake of staying up than might happen in <br/>
&gt; families<br/>
&gt; new to the idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no good reason to jump straight to a different way of being, when <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; can be done gradually.   Lots of little &quot;yesses&quot; are better than one giant <br/>
&gt; &quot;I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t care anymore,&quot; in lots of ways.    Better with food, better with <br/>

&gt; better with choices.   Maybe even better with a curriculum, if the parents <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995350234">That&#39;s exactly how I&#39;ve always been.  All of my friends have such a regimented sleep schedule that it is mind boggling.  They all think I&#39;m very radical because I don&#39;t have naptimes and the kids have all slept in my bed and then in my room until they felt ready to move into their own room.  I am SO far from radical (sigh).<br/>

I try not to tell my kids the eight-hour lie, because I know that every person is different. But the truth is that the boys ARE tired a good portion of the time, with dark circles under their eyes and my 9yo, the one who can&#39;t sleep late even when he tries, is starting to get the sniffles.  But I think they just need to learn their own bodies and learn what makes them feel the most comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
My original post wasn&#39;t about getting the kids to bed earlier so much as it was a question on how to create a balance between what my younger children want and need and what I need. <br/>
<br/>

I like this  a lot, maybe because I tried &quot;jumping into&quot; unschooling a couple of years ago and it was a disaster.  Now we&#39;re getting there gradually and the results have been truly amazing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410123495">I get up at 530 and leave the house by 545, back by 645 so that my husband can get in the shower at that time, that way, if one of the girls wakes up, my husband or I will be there for them.  I take my 7mo old with me.<br/>
I guess I could resume my walking schedule in a few years, but I actually just started it a month or so ago because my doctor says I need to lose weight since I&#39;m at very high risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes.  I&#39;ve tried exercise tapes and that sort of thing, but my baby wakes up when I get out of bed so I&#39;m not able to exercise unless he&#39;s with me and being rocked (so he&#39;s either in the stroller or in the Baby Bjorn).<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought about a neighborhood teenager coming by.  We live in a very small town and I can&#39;t imagine anyone wanting their kid to come over before dawn to hang out at my house (not to mention we really can&#39;t afford it), but I guess I should stop being such a naysayer and actually make an effort to try one of your suggestions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998099363">I definitely think you&#39;re right about the deschooling aspect of choosing their own bedtime.  I keep telling my husband that we just need to be patient and realize that they need to push the limits for a while to find out where their own boundaries lie.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to go about making dark and quiet more desireable than what the boys are experiencing, but I&#39;m thinking that if I can just be patient and try to establish a bedtime routine that is really pleasing to the girls, that they are helping to create, things will be fine. <br/>

Congratulations on being so committed to your health that you get up so  <br/>
early!  I&#39;m impressed.<br/>
 <br/>
There are lots of studies out now that say you don&#39;t have to get your  <br/>
exercise all at once.  You can spread it out a little all throughout  the day.  You <br/>
could take a shorter early morning walk with the baby,  and then take walks <br/>
with the kids at other parts of the day.  Walk to other  places in town, the <br/>
park, the grocery store, instead of driving.<br/>
 <br/>
The point is to keep moving all day, no matter what you&#39;re doing.  The  <br/>
reason we have to &quot;exercise&quot; in our modern world is because we don&#39;t have to  <br/>
&quot;work&quot; for our survival.  So spend some time imagining what it would be  like <br/>
without electricity &lt;g&gt; and do those kinds of things throughout the  day.  Tend a <br/>
garden, sweep the carpet instead of vacuum, cook  outside, spend lots of time <br/>
outside with the kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
I spend a lot of time imagining what my dad&#39;s childhood was like,  based on <br/>
the stories he&#39;s told me over my lifetime and knowing his mother and  putting <br/>
her stories together. (She&#39;ll be 100 in November, but her mind is  gone.)  She <br/>
had 4 kids and a farmhouse to run, and her husband died while  her kids were <br/>
young, and the river flooded and changed course and took their  farm and they <br/>
had to move into town.  So what was her life like?   Nursing twins (my daddy <br/>
and his sister) and giving birth again so soon  after.  Cooking what she grows <br/>
or slaughters.  I can still  remember her drinking black coffee out of the <br/>
saucer and the smell of burnt  bacon in her house.  My dad told me a story about <br/>
how the mule got  stuck in the mud with all 4 kids on it&#39;s back, and his mother <br/>
dragged that  mule out and all 4 kids with just her own strength.  I think <br/>
she was fit,  don&#39;t you?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting any mother go back to that hard life (which she never  <br/>
complained about, btw), but we can learn why we are so fat and diabetic in this  <br/>
country by considering what it was like without modern conveniences, and <br/>
emulate  that sort of activity.  <br/>
 <br/>
With three littles like you have, it&#39;s easy to get exhausted quickly.   But <br/>
just more movement built into your day will help, and that&#39;s easy to do with  <br/>
all the baby/toddler-wrangling you have to do.  The more you move, the  easier <br/>
it gets, and the more you move, the more you can do...<br/>
 <br/>
Another reason I try to move more every day is to make a good example for  my <br/>
youngest son, who has the bad diabetic genes, and I want him to have a  <br/>
history of a lifetime of fitness, instead of getting fat and lazy like his  mother <br/>
and father did.  (Not so lazy anymore!)  Maybe if you get your  older kids <br/>
moving more every day they won&#39;t be so wide-awake at midnight,  either.  <br/>

Rebecca, I had this same issue and solved it by getting a treadmill.  I still try to do it in the morning, while they&#39;re sleeping -- but they&#39;re older and could entertain themselves if I did it after they&#39;re awake.  If you&#39;re not comfortable wearing  the baby while on a treadmill (I&#39;m not sure how safe that&#39;d be?) you might be able to put the baby in a bouncy chair or swing or something and still keep him content with your presence... maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have talked about buying a treadmill, we just haven&#39;t had the money to buy one yet.  Even a used one is a little out of our budget right now...maybe Santa will bring me one!<br/>

guess I  could resume my walking schedule in a few years, but I actually just <br/>
started  it a month or so ago because my doctor says I need to lose weight <br/>
since I&#39;m at  very high risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Congratulations on being so committed to your health that you get up so  <br/>
early!  I&#39;m impressed.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of studies out now that say you don&#39;t have to get your  <br/>
exercise all at once.  You can spread it out a little all throughout  the day.  You <br/>
could take a shorter early morning walk with the baby,  and then take walks <br/>
with the kids at other parts of the day.  Walk to other  places in town, the <br/>
park, the grocery store, instead of driving.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To make something like what you&#39;re suggesting work, I would have to get more organized, because in the past I have tried doing the 10-minute here and there workout and it would never happen.  I do really well when I set aside a block of time first thing in the morning and workout before my day has begun.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t change.<br/>
<br/>
The point is to keep moving all day, no matter what you&#39;re doing.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I recently read an article that said washing dishes by hand burns 120 calories for 30 minutes, so maybe if I just look for a way to make each activity MORE active, I&#39;d burn more calories that way.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason I try to move more every day is to make a good example. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of the reason I get up so early everyday even though I&#39;d rather sleep in.  I want my kids to know that exercise and being fit is important to me and I know they&#39;ll see that if I continue to exercise and eat better.<br/>
Maybe if you get your  older kids <br/>
moving more every day they won&#39;t be so wide-awake at midnight,  either.  <br/>
<br/>

You&#39;re right.  I&#39;ve noticed that on the days they go bike riding or play basketball they go to bed earlier and sleep more soundly. So do I.<br/>

Reconsider your budget in such a way that if a treadmill will eliminate <br/>
stress, it&#39;s not just &quot;a treadmill&quot; but an investment in the mental health, <br/>
togetherness and unschooling of the family.   If it will prevent future therapy or <br/>

happiness (or at least calmer more peaceful thinking for the mom) it might be <br/>
worth not rejecting out of hand.<br/>

If you will inflexibly demand that they make their own decisions, it&#39;s <br/>
another incidence of inflexibility.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they want suggestions.   Holly can decide what to wear, but sometimes <br/>
we&#39;ll remind her of realities of the situation (conservative, dark, cold, not <br/>
nice to wear white, whatever).   My kids can decide what to eat, but a sick kid <br/>
is more likely to be gifted with soup and juice.   They don&#39;t need to make <br/>
those decisions for themselves, on their own, in the absence of oher factors and <br/>
ideas and reminders.<br/>
<br/>
There are other realities about being asleep, awake, noisy or loud when one <br/>
lives with other people, even if just one other consenting adult.   To pretend <br/>
otherwise isn&#39;t balance or principle.   <br/>
<br/>
The principle of making one&#39;s own decisions should be in the context of the <br/>
needs of the individual AND others involved.   I can drive a car whenever and <br/>
wherever I want to.   How I decide when and where has much to do with other <br/>
people in our family.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think giving choices should preclude helping kids, offering them food <br/>
and making their beds and offering to tuck them in and all that.   It&#39;s more <br/>
important to let go of &quot;have to&quot; than to let go of &quot;might want to,&quot; or of o<br/>
ffering and then being willing to take &quot;can I wait a while?&quot; for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Abandoning a whole way of life suddenly is probably almost as uncomfortable <br/>
as arbitrary rules are.   Saying yes more and more and more would feel better <br/>
for everyone, I think.   Maybe it&#39;s too late for you go gently if you&#39;ve <br/>
already jumped.<br/>

AAAAHHHH!!! This is like one of those Zen koans (is that spelled right?)that drive you nuts because they get your mind working in ways it&#39;s not used to.  I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t UNDERSTAND what you&#39;re saying.  I thought that by letting them take control of their own bedtimes, I was being more flexible, not less.  I just don&#39;t understand how I&#39;m supposed to give them the control, without letting them know that it&#39;s theirs.  <br/>
<br/>

My husband had mentioned that it seemed like our 13yo, Logan, wanted us to tell him what time to go to bed, but when I&#39;ve suggested that maybe he should go to bed since he looks tired or is yawning a lot, he says no.  So then what should I do?  <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve explained to the boys that the only way they can stay up later than everyone else is if they are respectful of everyone who is sleeping.  They also agreed to go to their room and lay low for  20-30 minutes each night so the girls would be able to fall asleep and so could Damon and I.  So I feel that the needs of everyone involved ARE being considered.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think giving choices should preclude helping kids, offering them food and making their beds and offering to tuck them in and all that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why you would think that that is what has happened.  The one thing that had fallen by the wayside that I&#39;ve reinstated, was the whole bedtime routine with brushing of teeth, washing face and hands, pajamas and a story.  Then if Colton (9yo)wants to stay up he can, but at least I&#39;ve had that time with him and he&#39;s gotten the personal hygeine part taken care of with someone to help if he needs it.  <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
So did I inadvertently replace, &quot;You have to go to bed now,&quot; with &quot;You have to stay up because you CAN stay up?&quot;  Do you think that&#39;s how the boys are taking it and if so, how do I rectify that?<br/>

Nobody here can tell you exactly what to do - nobody knows exactly  <br/>

YOU have to decide if YOU think that might be how the boys are taking  <br/>

good for your family. Use your own thinking skills on this stuff -  <br/>
you know your own kids. Maybe none of the ideas given by people here  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426601171">I know, I know.  I just feel so confused about what I&#39;m doing because this is so new to me. Also,  I&#39;m having to hold back from completely following my instincts since my husband is not really in favor of any of things that I want to do and so it&#39;s a constant compromise between what I feel is best for the kids and my husband&#39;s much more conservative views.  But you are totally right.  No one can know what is going in my home and with my sons but me and I need to have a little more faith in my own perceptions.  Thanks for the wake up call.<br/>

Nobody here can tell you exactly what to do - nobody knows exactly  <br/>
what you&#39;re really doing. We can only make guesses, based on how you  <br/>

light. This is a place for &quot;ideas,&quot; but not for a &quot;blueprint.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YOU have to decide if YOU think that might be how the boys are taking  <br/>
it. And then read all the ideas and you decide what sounds right and  <br/>
good for your family. Use your own thinking skills on this stuff -  <br/>
you know your own kids. Maybe none of the ideas given by people here  <br/>
will work, but you might come up with a variation or combination or  <br/>
something entirely different that is inspired by ideas you read here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884285951">My 13yo does a couple of pages of Key to Algebra every couple of days and the other days we do math riddles, play games (Monopoly, Equate, Yahtzee) or he cooks or practices origami.  He actually chose to do the algebra on his own after reading a Newsweek article about this college student who works in a factory over summer breaks.  He told me that he really does want to go to college and so we sat down and looked at some of the requirements for admission to some of our local colleges, so I think of his math as still being unschooling.  But he does Vocabulary from Classical Roots for about 15 minutes a day and then all of us sit down and read one of the history stories from Story of the World and then he and his brother can choose to do any of the different activities if they want to.  That&#39;s it for him.<br/>
 <br/>
My 9yo is using Saxon 54.  I usually just sit down with him, we read over the lesson together and then he does the practice problems and usually about five problems from the lesson.  If he just wants to give me the answers orally that&#39;s fine, and if he seems to understand the principle right off the bat, then he won&#39;t even do the problems from the lesson.  We do &quot;book math&quot; a couple of times a week and then the rest of the time he plays MathBlaster or Totally Tut or Subtraction Shark, etc.  He does history with his brother and I, and occasionally I&#39;ll ask him to do some spelling puzzles or we&#39;ll play Alphabug Soup or Scrabble.  That&#39;s pretty much it.<br/>
 <br/>
So we&#39;re not very structured and if there is something more interesting going on, or if the boys are reading a good book that they just can&#39;t put down or are playing a game (not a video game or watching TV because my husband is still against these things before 5pm), then we&#39;ll just skip &quot;lessons&quot; for the day.  I would eventually just like to skip them altogether, but my husband is taking some time to get what I&#39;m trying to say about unschooling.<br/>

 <br/>
What I said to the boys in terms of staying up late was that as long as they didn&#39;t wake anyone else  they could stay up, so no roughhousing, loud talking, opening and closing of doors a million times(all of our bedrooms and the den are all down the same hallway),etc.<br/>

For some reason the above line just cracked me up!  I don&#39;t feel that way at all, though.  Sometimes I DO find myself feeling that if I could just copy your life or Pam&#39;s or Joyce&#39;s then I would be doing things &quot;right&quot; but that&#39;s not realistic or even what I really want.  I love my life, I just always am looking for ways to bring more peace and joy into my home and family.  Unschooling is the way to that.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341875893">Sounds like sort of fun - math riddles and so on. You might look at  <br/>
Marilyn Burns books - &quot;Math for Smarty Pants&quot; and &quot;The I Hate  <br/>
Mathematics Book&quot; for activities, as well as &quot;Family Math&quot;  - the one  <br/>
for middle school years has algebra activities, by the way. But - a  <br/>
good move toward unschooling might be to ditch the Saxon! Do you HAVE  <br/>
to use Saxon with the 9 yo? Can you find something that is less  <br/>
stultifying and less likely to make him end up absolutely HATING  <br/>
math? Because that IS what seems to happen with so many kids who use  <br/>
Saxon.<br/>

If anybody has not looked at Julie Brennan&#39;s &quot;Living Math&quot; website -  <br/>
it is so wonderful, you really should browse around there! Julie is a  <br/>
homeschooling mom in San Diego - doesn&#39;t quite consider herself an  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406025949">We&#39;ve already ditched the Saxon for my older son - because he hated it - but I had all the Saxon stuff here at the house and I hated not to use when it cost so much money.  Yes, I know, the kids are more important than cash, but it&#39;s hard to justify (to my husband) spending additional money on math stuff when we spent a small fortune on the Saxon.  My husband grumbles and groans about the costs of homeschooling as it is.  I have very little of the typical homeschool stuff now, but I like to get books, videos, toys and museum memberships that I think the kids will enjoy, so my husband is constantly pointing out to me that &quot;public school is free.&quot;  HA!  Not only did we have all sorts of stuff we had to pay for when the kids went to ps, but the emotional cost was indescribeable, but he just doesn&#39;t get it.  Yet.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m going to put the Saxon aside and just spend $15 a month on the books you mentioned. When we lived in New Mexico I checked out all of them from the local library, but in this town&#39;s tiny library they don&#39;t have them.  <br/>

unschooling (John Holt et al) end up getting purchased because they&#39;re <br/>
not readily available in the local library, then when they have been <br/>
read and re-read and absorbed and become more of a shelf sitter than a <br/>
ready reference, it might be time to find some way to pass them along <br/>
to the next generation of folks who are asking the same questions. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, it could be unnecessary in few decades as unschooling <br/>
becomes more visible and we start getting all these grown unschooled <br/>
kids (who are just starting to reach the 18-25 demographic now, by and <br/>
large) starting to have families and all and then there&#39;d possibly be <br/>
second generation unschooled kids. In a few generations, there&#39;d be no <br/>
more grandparents saying &quot;I walked to school in 10 feet of snow uphill <br/>
both ways...&quot; lol<br/>

you buy and read stuff and then maybe in 5 or 10 years (when you get <br/>
done re-reading it) DONATE it to the library for future unschoolers.<br/>

(which reminds me I need to plan on getting 2 copies of Rue&#39;s book - <br/>
one for me and one for our hs support group&#39;s lending library - gotta <br/>
get the good stuff in there somehow...)<br/>
