Things a True Southerner Knows: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The difference between a hissie fit and a conniption fit. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pretty much how many fish make up a mess? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What general direction cattywumpus is? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That &quot;gimme sugar&quot; don&#39;t mean pass the sugar. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When somebody&#39;s &quot;fixin&quot; to do something, it won&#39;t be long. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The difference between Yankee&#39;s and damn Yankee&#39;s. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How good a cold grape Nehi and cheese crackers are at a country store. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knows what, &quot;Well I Suwannee !!&quot; means. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ain&#39;t nobody&#39;s biscuits like Grandma&#39;s biscuits !! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A good dog is worth its weight in gold. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Real gravy don&#39;t come from the store. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The War of Northern Aggression was over state rights, not slavery. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When &quot;by and by&quot; is. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How to handle their &quot;pot likker&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The difference between &quot;pert&#39; near&quot; and &quot;a right far piece&quot;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The differences between a redneck, a good ol&#39; boy, and trailer trash. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never to go snipe hunting twice. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At one point learned what happens when you swallow tobacco juice. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never to assume that the other car with the flashing turn signal is <br/>
&gt; actually going to make a turn. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may wear long sleeves, but you should always roll &#39;em up past the <br/>
&gt; elbows. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You should never loan your tools, pick-up, or gun to nobody. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A belt serves a greater purpose than holding Daddy&#39;s pants up. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rocking chairs and swings are guaranteed stress relievers. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rocking chairs and swings with an old person in them are history lessons. <br/>
