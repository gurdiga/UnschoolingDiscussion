 </span></blockquote>My son is 9 and still has trouble pronouncing his r&#39;s and s and L. He does <br/>
not want to go to a speech therapist at this point. Is there any way I can help <br/>
him at home? R seems to make him sound the most &quot;babyish.&quot; Other well meaning <br/>
people have been pointing it out to me lately that he should see a speech <br/>
therapist. <br/>
Thank you, Teresa<br/>

I think *they* might need to see a hearing specialist! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
