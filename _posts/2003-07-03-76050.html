<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490504952">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to warn every one of something I received in the mail yesterday.  <br/>
This is directed towards high school aged students (namely 11th & 12th graders <br/>
and those going to college next year) and their families.  But, those of you <br/>
who do not have students of near college age just yet, may want to be on the <br/>
look out for this type of mailing.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I received an unsolicited snail mail &quot;College Aid Application,&quot; <br/>
While it does NOT look like the FAFSA (which is the FREE application for <br/>
FEDERAL, and in some cases STATE FINANCIAL AID for College:   &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fafsaonline.com/&quot;">http://www.fafsaonline.com/&quot;</a>&gt;FAFSA Online <br/>
Application Services, FAFSAonline.com, helps you complete the Free Application for <br/>
Federal Student Financial Aid.&lt;/A&gt;), it does APPEAR to be LEGAL.  <br/>
<br/>
What it basically is, is a form for you to fill out so that they can do <br/>
SEARCHES for Financial Aid for college for you.  You MUST pay them a &quot;Processing <br/>
Fee&quot; of $39.95.  Optional fees include: an &quot;Updated Service&quot; (to receive a new <br/>
updated report in 12 months) for $15.00 (a &quot;savings&quot; of $24.95), &quot;RUSH <br/>
Processing&quot; (for priority processing/priority shipping) $10.00.<br/>
<br/>
ALL OF THESE SERVICES ARE FREE!!!!   If you are willing to do the &quot;leg work&quot; <br/>
yourself.  It is NOT difficult.  I have found numerous places on the Internet <br/>
where I have found everything from &quot;extra, low interest loans&quot; (for <br/>
students/families not eligible for Federal/State Aid), to various types of &quot;contest <br/>
grants.&quot;  These contests (or the ones that I have looked into, are FREE to enter, <br/>
are NOT scams, and offer a variety of reasons they offer the scholarships <br/>
(i.e., African American, Gay/Lesbian, dad/mom was in the armed forces, you are a <br/>
woman over 35, you are homeschooled, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to did up these websites again and send them on to every one.<br/>
<br/>
JUST DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SNAIL MAIL SCAM!!!!<br/>
