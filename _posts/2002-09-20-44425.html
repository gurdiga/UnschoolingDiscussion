<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273773552">**I need some good reading material for my husband so that he may <br/>
better understand what and why we are doing (deschooling right <br/>
now).  He does much better when left to read and find out for <br/>
himself...hmm.**<br/>
<br/>
People were saying that there are two great deschooling articles in the<br/>
current issue of HEM, Home Education Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know off of the top of my head if you can order a single issue<br/>
when it&#39;s the current issue.  But I think you can order back issues.<br/>
<br/>
If we haven&#39;t driven Helen off with our tantrums, she can give you a<br/>
definitive answer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563031880">Thanks for all the suggestions everyone!  I have order several books <br/>
but it take s a while for them to get to me and HEM as well.  I <br/>
should have more resources by the time I get all of my materials.<br/>
