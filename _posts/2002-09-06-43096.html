&lt;&lt; I&#39;m just curious because I guess I haven&#39;t run into any of these people. <br/>
Are <br/>
 the majority of Christian homeshoolers like this???<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have to say the majority think that spanking is fine.<br/>
I don&#39;t know the varying degrees of hitting and the percentages that would <br/>
agree with belts or Ezzo or other BS.<br/>
But in the case of homeschooling Christians, they feel that God has directed <br/>
them to do it and they seem to fall on the side of very conservative or <br/>
fundi.  That is my experience, and simply a generalization. I don&#39;t think <br/>
there&#39;s any way to know numbers.<br/>
I have heard many of the homeschoolers down here say that they didn&#39;t want to <br/>
homeschool, they didn&#39;t want their kids home but God TOLD them to.<br/>
I wonder what kind of voice God had when he directed them to do this thing? <br/>
Interesting. I&#39;m still scratching my head over that one.<br/>
Apparently God likes having kids home to torture their parents who were happy <br/>
they were in school. Poetic justice perhaps? lol<br/>

Bible DOES say if you spare the rod, you spoil the child and I DO <br/>
believe that the Bible should be our guide for life.  What I&#39;ve <br/>
changed is that maybe the word &quot;rod&quot; doesn&#39;t mean a literal rod, but <br/>
a measuring tool.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you believed that your house had to be kept a certain way--no <br/>
dust, beds made perfectly every day, shiny floors that you could see <br/>
your reflection in, never a dish in the sink--it would be so much <br/>
easier to do if there were never kids in the house to mess it up.  Or <br/>
if you believed that you needed time to yourself to sit and watch <br/>
soaps all day.  Or if you believed that you needed to do all kinds of <br/>
volunteer work that you couldn&#39;t do with small kids along. Probably a <br/>
lot of us have had SOMETHING, somewhere along the way in our <br/>
parenting experience,where we say that we would like to do something <br/>
but can&#39;t because we have kids to take care of.  Jury duty or <br/>
SOMETHING! lol <br/>
<br/>
But yet, deep inside of us, we know that what we REALLY want to do--<br/>
what would REALLY be the right thing to do for our kids-- is to keep <br/>
them home.  <br/>
<br/>
Christians believe that it is God telling them to keep their kids <br/>
home, non-Christians believe it is just their convictions or inner <br/>
voice or whatever.  <br/>

<br/>
The following webpage has an excerpt from Mothering Magazine by William<br/>
Sears, himself a Christian, about the infamous Proverb &quot;Spare the rod<br/>
and spoil the child&quot;. I found it very interesting. Briefly, he refers to<br/>
other passages about the Rod as the Shepherd&#39;s rod of guidance, rather<br/>
than punishment. Since Christ is also said to be the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; it<br/>
seems to be lovely way to bring Old and New Testaments together on this<br/>
issue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly how I think it is (being a Christian myself). That&#39;s why I <br/>
don&#39;t understand anyone who professes to be a Christian, aka follower of <br/>
Christ&#39;s teachings, who believes in the rod/spoil, homeschool to get away <br/>
from &quot;them&quot;, etc. Christ taught to accept all people not just those with <br/>
similar beliefs. You should try to be a decent person but that doesn&#39;t &quot;buy <br/>
you a ticket into heaven&quot;. I have no idea what will happen when I die. I have <br/>
certain beliefs, but I know that I won&#39;t find the answer until that happens. <br/>

The same part of the Bible that says that says hundreds of OTHER things that <br/>
American fundamentalists totally ignore.  HAPPILY ignore.  If questioned, <br/>
they&#39;ll start about &quot;the new covenant,&quot; and &quot;Jesus died to save us by grace&quot; <br/>
and stuff.  So they&#39;ll eat pork rinds AND spank their kids.  If they can eat <br/>
pork rinds, they should relegate that spanking-justification to things Jesus <br/>
died to save them from, part of the &quot;old&quot; covenant, stuff just JEWS do.  Like <br/>
not eat pork.<br/>
<br/>
And... come to think of it, does anyone know any Jewish teachers who advocate <br/>
spanking children?   How come those who are reading that in the original <br/>
Hebrew aren&#39;t whippin&#39; up on their kids?<br/>

<br/>
So Christian leaders who tell their &quot;flocks&quot; (I hate that imagery and analogy <br/>
that makes christians sheep to be herded around by &quot;pastors&quot;) that God <br/>
commands them to chastise their children physically are pretty much <br/>
interpreting a proverb as a commandment.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus didn&#39;t say to hit any kids.  He said it would be better if a  man had <br/>
never been born than that he harm one of those children.<br/>
<br/>
There is a large block of Christianity which picks and chooses from the Bible <br/>
to justify being controlling and abusive.  And within that &quot;community&quot; there <br/>
are thousands of homeschoolers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;The Lord is my shepherd...&quot;  In fact, Christ had a real problem with <br/>
the priestly establishment... HE is the Good Shepherd and there is a <br/>
clear distinction between the &quot;Good&quot; and the &quot;Ordinary&quot; shepherd. The <br/>
Good Shepherd seeks out the lost wayward sheep and puts himself <br/>
between the wolf (read &quot;evil&quot;) and the sheep to protect the sheep and <br/>
lead them to a place of safety.  The ordinary shepherd runs away and <br/>
has no inner resources or physical where-with-all to withstand the <br/>
threat of the &quot;wolf&quot; and the dark places.<br/>
While the old testement lessons teach the truth of God&#39;s authority, <br/>
Christ offers a new teaching which has little to do with the &quot;spare <br/>
the rod, spoil the child&quot; mentality.</div>
