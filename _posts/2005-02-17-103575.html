<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996471951">Thank you so much, Pam, for this post. I really needed to hear that. <br/>
With all that I&#39;m going through right now, it was good to hear this. Tomorrow is a very scary day for me. Hospital tests and I may have to stay overnight (or so). Won&#39;t know until I get there. So I may go &quot;no email&quot; so I don&#39;t have four hundered posts on my email when I get back. ;-)  If I do, you&#39;ll know why. Thanks again.<br/>
 <br/>
Much Peace to you,<br/>
 <br/>
Susan <br/>

Your son is right, Susan. People share. Women, especially, share.<br/>
<br/>
There are email lists that don&#39;t allow any actual real personal <br/>
information - it is ALL about theories. I find those incredibly boring <br/>
and useless.<br/>
<br/>
But many of us learn by telling our stories to each other and working <br/>
on them together - we chew on them - we dig for the bigger principles <br/>
at work, we figure out how we feel about things by talking about <br/>
real-life situations. Although we post specifics - true anecdotes and <br/>
situations - it is the underlying basics that we really focus on. <br/>
That&#39;s how we learn from each other. I post that my kids sing all the <br/>
time - at the top of their voices - they LOVE to sing. You may not have <br/>
singers, but you may have a kid who plays the radio loudly all the <br/>
time. Or kids who just use really loud voices. At the same time my <br/>
specific issue is looked at, perhaps in some depth with differing <br/>
responses, people will be comparing and contrasting it to other <br/>
situations that they&#39;ve faced. Two of the most important things we&#39;ll <br/>
do will be to see how general unschooling principles apply to this <br/>
specific situation and to see if general unschooling principles can be <br/>
developed out of this specific situation. Either way - it is all useful <br/>
analytical discussion. NONE of it is about us all somehow determining <br/>
who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or otherwise. None of it is personal. None of <br/>
us have any authority over each other.<br/>
<br/>
However, we have simply found that if it is all hypothetical, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have that ring of truth to it that makes it so real and useful.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t share much, to be honest. I didn&#39;t get any sense from your <br/>
original posts of what your decision-making was like, what your <br/>
relationship was like, etc. Without that context, people&#39;s responses <br/>
will be more shots in the dark - so keeping in mind that they may be <br/>
useful to somebody else, you simply need to either ignore what doesn&#39;t <br/>
fit or expand on your situation more so that the conversation can be <br/>
more focused, if that is what you&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
If not, your comments might be the starting point for a discussion that <br/>
will expand and branch out in directions that are no longer even <br/>
relevant at all to your own situation.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, NOTHING written is really about any individual - we know so <br/>
very little about each other (most of the 1600+ of us, anyway), that <br/>
we&#39;re all just responding to what WE get from what others write.<br/>
<br/>
Take what you can use - if something provokes thought, consider it a <br/>
gift. Ignore the rest - unless you feel like questioning it or adding <br/>
to it or expanding upon it or disagreeing with it - or, in other words, <br/>
analyzing it yourself.<br/>
