I like this.<br/>
When I feel a bit overwhelmed at Jalens neediness (he&#39;s two), wanting to <br/>
breastfeed a lot still, not sleeping all night etc...<br/>
I just look at him and remember I&#39;m holding a little man that will be strong <br/>
and tall and independant one day.<br/>
It makes this time all the sweeter.<br/>
He&#39;s just a man in his little boys body right now.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I think that too.  And there&#39;s no time at which they turn off their childhood <br/>
and being their &quot;real&quot; life with memories.  These times will be remembered <br/>
and part of their real, whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more people had felt that way when I was younger, and treated me more <br/>
as a whole person instead of a potentially future person in training.  It&#39;s <br/>
not right, and it&#39;s damaging.<br/>
