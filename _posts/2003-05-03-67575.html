<div id="ygrps-yiv-72459675">Well, we have come to the conclusion that Joy is not bringing the pups out.. <br/>
They are crawling out on thier own.. Evidently, she can&#39;t keep track of <br/>
them... She may even still be having puppies.  We had the one, trying to take <br/>
care of it.. Then, another one appeared outside a few feet from the workshop. <br/>
 We just put it on the blade of a shovel and put it back beside her.. She <br/>
didn&#39;t reject it.   So, we brought #1 wayward puppy back and put him with her <br/>
too.  I do think, when she comes out, we will just have to get her and bring <br/>
her in the house and then get the puppies.  Otherwise, she seems to keep <br/>
&quot;losing&quot; them.  They are incredibly strong and mobile to be only hours old.<br/>
