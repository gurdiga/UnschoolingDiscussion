Most dogs behave poorly because they&#39;re lonely  and are <br/>\nnot trained and socialized to the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, which is why we tried a few times at first.  But, I honestly can say I didn&#39;t try all that hard after my son got the stitches.  She seemed fairly happy out back, for the most part, but I know she could have it better.  We didn&#39;t do our best, I&#39;m glad we found someone who could.  I want to wait a while before we try again, to make sure we do this right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---I wouldn&#39;t get another dog until I learned about dog behavior and  committed <br/>\nto training the dog properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t, one of the problems was that we were not ready for this dog, she came as an impulse from dh.  He won&#39;t make that mistake again.  I didn&#39;t even get to go and help them pick out our dog.  They were supposed to browse, not buy.  Believe me, he has learned that it needs to be a family decision.  I want to learn to properly train a puppy, maybe have Ben take it to puppy classes.  This dog was a rescue from the HS and dh is insisting we do that again.  She was almost a year old and very wild.  I really want to go with the puppy like someone suggested.  I&#39;m going to really research, just like I thought we were going to last time.  Live and learn.  I&#39;m glad it worked out okay for her.  Dh went by there and she seems happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n---And, frankly, learning about dog behavior and training the dog properly is as easy as reading this wonderful, short book (SuperPuppy: How to Raise the Best Dog You&#39;ll Ever Have!..... by Peter J. Vollmer), which is a good read BEFORE you get a puppy, but makes more sense afterwards and is not too difficult to use *in the moment*, either:  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the title, I will look for it.  Any recommendations on breeds?  We want a medium sized dog.  Not purebred, mixed.  Dh still wants a pound puppy. <br/>\n<br/>\n---If I ever got a puppy again, I&#39;d definitely crate train it.   It gives the<br/>\npuppy his own space and time away from the kids when he needs it.  Plus is<br/>\ngives you some peace of mind when you are not there to keep an eye on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking into this.  I&#39;ve heard it is good, but it sounds awful leaving them in there so much. But, I think the puppy having his own space would be a plus especially with kids around.  And, not having to constantly keep on eye on him.  We go on lots of outings, so that would be hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen was better today and even said he understands a little better why we had to find her a new home.  I was so worried we were scarring him for life.  He can really turn a phrase that just tears your heart and yes, he did say &quot;this is the worst day of my young life&quot;.  He also said, &quot;my heart is breaking into a million and a half pieces.  I will never get over this.&quot;  He is very dramatic.  Today, he barely mentioned her.   I&#39;m sure he needed a break from his feelings today.   His imaginary friend, Clocky made an apperance today, so that means he is having a hard time.  Clocky only comes around now when he&#39;s feeling sad or nervous.  He showed up at gymnastics and pushed him off the balance beam.  Ben used to have up to ten imaginary friends, quite a menagerie.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also mentioned wanting a bunny.  So, we might get a bunny.  I always wanted a bunny and never got one.  So, a bunny might be just fine.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all of your input and advice.  It was very helpful.  We did the right thing, I know.  But, it was hard hurting him so much.  He seemed so upset.  He does feel things so deeply and almost always to the extreme.  Complete joy, utter sadness, blinding anger, and he so sweet and sentimental, yet a rough and tumble wild boy.    We do talk a lot about feelings and he really has learned to express himself well.  <br/>\nLaura <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] going against a child&#39;s wishes","postDate":"1098223647","msgId":100713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE5MjIwNzE5Lk1XQVQyMTg4Lm10YTExLmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWM0YjYyNCQ5NDBiNjg3MCRiMTFkMzI0M0BkaWdhdGl6ZXI+"},"prevInTopic":100711,"nextInTopic":100719,"prevInTime":100712,"nextInTime":100714,"topicId":100692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If I ever got a puppy again, I d definitely crate train it.

Those ideas are pretty articulate for a 5 year old. (Though I can imagine my youngest <br/>\nhaving had the language for that kind of thought.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is good to listen to him.

We will probably wait a while to get the puppy, he says he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant one right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing you don&#39;t need to do is to keep justifying why you let the dog go to another <br/>\nfamily. If you do that, you will need to make the dog worse than she was and your son&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings less important than they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s true is that you and your son are at cross-purposes with reference to the dog.

We have found our dog a new home.  Here is the story.  A few months back, dh called me while I was working to say he found the perfect dog.  We had planned to look around for a while, and find one that was a puppy that would grow into a medium sized dog.  I was put in the position to agree, since he had already pretty much told our son who is 5, that they would get her, I was working and couldn&#39;t really discuss it well.  She turned out to be a much older, larger and completely out of control dog.  She chews up everything in sight and has even chewed up the outside of our house.  She has been living in the backyard ever since.  She is very rough with Ben and has even caused him to fall from his play fort and get 8 stitches on his chin.  She nips him, in play, but it hurts and he hardly ever played with her or even remembered that she was there.  She knocks him down and is just too rough.  A sweet dog, just very rambunctious for a kid that is a bit timid around large animals.  They just didn&#39;t click.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the poor dog was so lonely being outside all of the time.  She had complete access to my dh&#39;s air conditioned gameroom/shed, it wasn&#39;t cruel, just not great for her.  We went out of town this weekend and a friend took care of her.  They asked if they could keep her.  We brought her home, Ben had been concerned that she wouldn&#39;t come back.  So, I wanted to make sure she did.  Dh and I decided that we were not providing a good home for her and that it would be best for everyone if she went to live with our friends.  Ben can visit anytime, he and dh go over there often.  He is now heartbroken and has been crying all day.  I feel awful and so does dh.  But, honestly, he hardly ever paid attention to her.  We talked about getting a dog that fit our family better and that we found a family that she fit better in.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you balance letting your child make choices with doing what is best for the family or the pet?  He is just saying things that really break my heart &quot;you shouldn&#39;t give away a child&#39;s dog, that&#39;s not right.  she is part of our family and you are just breaking the rules and giving her away.  this is the worst day of my young life and you did this to me &quot;  I&#39;m just trying to listen and comfort him and let him feel sad and angry at us.
