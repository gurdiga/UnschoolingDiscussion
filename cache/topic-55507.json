Dd&#39;s are always putting on<br/>\nfashion shows, and playing dress up like movie stars, princesses and<br/>\nsuch. Dh is always giving them the &quot;you look just fabulous daaling&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;aren&#39;t you beautiful&quot;. Come to think of it, 3dd has a preoccupation with<br/>\n&quot;beautiful&quot; too. She only wants to wear her &quot;beautiful dresses&quot;, and just<br/>\nlast night she only wanted to sleep on the<br/>\n&quot;beautiful sofa&quot;, the floral one. Maybe we just use the word &quot;beautiful&quot;<br/>\ntoo lightly in our house.

Maybe <br/>\nwhen she gets older, who knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I thought of when you mentioned why your daughter wants them <br/>\nwas when my mom puts her clip on earrings (at 77, she never had her ears <br/>\ndone) on my Alyssa, who is 2. She comes and shows us and of course the first <br/>\nthing we all say is, &quot;Look how beautiful you look!!&quot; Maybe something like <br/>\nthat innocently said stuck in her mind. It could just be her own taste and <br/>\nfeeling. She thinks they are beautiful (the earrings that she doesn&#39;t have) <br/>\nand of course would see someone more beautiful with some on. I somehow don&#39;t <br/>\nthink at 5, with how you say you are with her, she is into material things <br/>\nand sees beauty as only with accessories!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 with e-mail virus protection service: 2 months FREE* <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128897139,"authorName":"love-it-here@juno.com","from":"love-it-here@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: Tattoos/Pierced Ears","postDate":"1042900891","msgId":55517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTE4LjA5NDEzNy4tMzQ0NDE5LjAubG92ZS1pdC1oZXJlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55508,"nextInTopic":55544,"prevInTime":55516,"nextInTime":55518,"topicId":55507,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sat, 18 Jan 2003 06:23:23 -0500 Fetteroll  ... their ...

The<br/>\nway we live is to emphasize on the natural beauty in things, not the<br/>\nartificially created/culturally suggested way. So I asked dd what would<br/>\nmake her feel that way. Apparently the discussion on her not being<br/>\nbeautiful without earrings had more of an impact on me than her, because<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t even remember the conversation. She did however remember her<br/>\n5yo cousin (who had her ears pierced at 2 months) telling her that she<br/>\nwould be pretty if she got earrings too. So then we talked about beauty,<br/>\nand I asked her if she knew how pretty she was. She said &quot;sure Mom.
