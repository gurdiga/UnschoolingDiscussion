The fact the doctor<br/>\nis starting out with arthroscopy is really good, and it will be great if he<br/>\ndoes not have to make a big incision, heals much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the question on whether or not you should have the ACL done, that is<br/>\ndifficult to decide.  My general advice to anyone since all these knee<br/>\nsurgeries, would be to not ever have surgery until you have no other<br/>\noptions.(Before this last surgery, I basically said I would not have another<br/>\nsurgery until it got to the point I could no longer walk.  Well, that day<br/>\ncame, and rather than be wheel chair bound I took the surgery.  Since my<br/>\nknee is now plastic and titanium it is doing great!)  But, if your ACL is no<br/>\nlonger connected, you will end up with a knee that is weak and gives out on<br/>\nyou, that isn&#39;t fun, I can tell you from personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, it has to be a personal decision, but my best advice would be to<br/>\nproceed with caution if that is possible. (Though it sounds like the surgery<br/>\ndate is already set). And if you have the surgery, as I said before, be<br/>\nreally serious about the PT!<br/>\n<br/>\nmany blessings,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Puddinghead1@...\">Puddinghead1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, January 04, 2003 5:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: OT-Any advice on ACL reconstruct knee<br/>\nsurgery?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thanks I will let you and everyone know how things go.

I tore my ACL about twenty<br/>\nyears ago, and have had oodles of trouble since.  I am now in the fifth<br/>\nmonth of recovery from a total knee replacement though, so things are<br/>\nlooking up. (I have had eight surgeries on that knee since the ACL, all to<br/>\nno avail.  I am not saying this to scare you, but to let you know that I<br/>\nhave lots of experience with knee surgery, lol.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy very best advice to you is this.  After you have had the surgery and you<br/>\nare given exercises to do at Physical Therapy, or at home, do them!  I tore<br/>\nmy ACL as a college student and did not keep up with the therapy.  Your knee<br/>\nwill only be as strong as those quad muscles, so determine that you are<br/>\nreally going to work at it.  If the doctor&#39;s try to just give you an at home<br/>\nprogram and don&#39;t send you to PT, keep fighting until they do send you.<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to lay around(and let m your family wait on you) and let the<br/>\nknee heal at first, but as soon as you are ready for more strenuous stuff,<br/>\ndo the exercises and keep them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be in my prayers.
