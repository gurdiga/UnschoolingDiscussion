Well, books needed to study for <br/>\nthe tests would be extra, so let&#39;s say for under $1000, max. <br/>\nWhoopee!!!

Using this <br/>\nmethod, you could theoretically complete your entire bachelor&#39;s <br/>\ndegree within a few days! If you&#39;re interested in this method, <br/>\ncontact Excelsior College. They&#39;ve prepared a list of textbooks for <br/>\neach test and a practice sheet that includes sample questions as well <br/>\nas a description of the examination&#39;s content. You can find these at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.excelsior.edu\">http://www.excelsior.edu</a> To receive the official GRE study <br/>\nmaterials and more information contact: GRE-ETS, P. O. Box 6000, <br/>\nPrinceton, NJ 08541-6000, 609/771-7906, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gre.org\">http://www.gre.org</a> &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVoeller does clearly state that these GRE tests are not easy and that <br/>\nstudents should study and prepare very well before taking them.  <br/>\nStill at only $130 each for the GRE exams, and only $46 each plus <br/>\nanother $10-$15 for the test registration center&#39;s fee for the CLEP <br/>\nexams, one could theoretically get a four year accredited college <br/>\ndegree for less than $1500 in only as long as it takes to study for <br/>\nthese tests and take them. Wow! <br/>\n<br/>\nSurely this is an option suitable for many who would rather spend <br/>\ntheir lives &quot;being&quot; and &quot;doing&quot; something rather than &quot;becoming,&quot; and <br/>\npaying a great deal of money, spending a great deal of time, for the <br/>\nprivilege of &quot;becoming.&quot; All the options he lists would also be <br/>\nsuitable for adults who never finished college and decide to complete <br/>\ntheir college degree. Or for those who decide to start late in life <br/>\nand who could benefit greatly by saving years and years and thousands <br/>\nof dollars they might otherwise spend on their families and their <br/>\nlives. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, he clearly spells out all the other options available <br/>\nfor getting college credit without going to or enrolling in a class, <br/>\nwhich include: CLEP exams, Excelsior College exams, DANTES Subject <br/>\nStandardized Tests (DSSTs), Thomas Edison College Exam Programs <br/>\n(TECEP), our own Ohio University correspondences courses (60 of which <br/>\ncan be taken on a credit-by-examination basis), the New York <br/>\nUniversity Foreign Language Testing Program, AP Exams, and the <br/>\nGraduate Record Exams.<br/>\n<br/>\nContinuing he spells out the how-tos of portfolio assessment for <br/>\ncollege course credit, another easy way to get credit for experience, <br/>\ngiving step-by-step instructions on how to put together a well-<br/>\nconstructed portfolio for any course. Then he goes on to explain how <br/>\nto get credit for portfolio assessment even if the college you are <br/>\nattending does not grant this type of credit. <br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing this he details how to use internships, exisiting <br/>\ninternship programs or by designing your own internships, for college <br/>\ncredit.  Then he provides lots of detailed information on online and <br/>\ncorrespondence courses for college credit, independent study and <br/>\ncommunity college resources, general online study resources, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s only the first one-third of this excellent book! The last two-<br/>\nthirds of this book are excellent resources on how to increase your <br/>\nlearning capacity, how to speed up the learning process while <br/>\nincreasing comprehension, how to cut study time by 50%, especially <br/>\nfor the types of tests and exams that these techniques require, a <br/>\nwealth of study enhancing information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend that every home educator, especially those who do <br/>\nnot buy into the huge mega billion dollar industry that is higher <br/>\neducation in this country, those who have learned that quality <br/>\neducation does not take place only in classrooms, spend the meager <br/>\n$19.99 for this book. Or order it from your library and see for <br/>\nyourself. It is a goldmine of time and money-saving information, <br/>\noffering many alternatives to the independent learner, to anyone who <br/>\nchooses to be resourceful rather than to follow traditional <br/>\neducational dictates. With today&#39;s economy this book would pay for <br/>\nitself in one CLEP exam&#39;s college credit, or one portfolio assessment <br/>\nfor course credit.
