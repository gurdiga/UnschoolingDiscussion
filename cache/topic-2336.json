Their current","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1461650020\">Is it a new development or something that has been going on before the<br/>\nmother shared that there was another baby on the way?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four sons. Their current ages are 15, 13, 10 1/2 and 8. My 13 year<br/>\nold used to be full of rage from about age 2 to four. Daily he would throw<br/>\nthings and nothing within 10 feet was safe! In his case, I think he was<br/>\nmostly frustrated with his inability to express himself clearly or with his<br/>\nbody&#39;s inability to do what he wanted his body to do. He was developing<br/>\nnormally but his expectations were greater than his developmental level.<br/>\nAnyway, everyone would have to run out of the room or risk getting hurt. I<br/>\nwould stay and grab all hard and breakables out of his reach. Grabbing him<br/>\nand holding him lovingly did not work. It only made him angrier. My usual<br/>\nstrategy was just to wait it out as long as everyone was safe. After about a<br/>\nyear of this, I tried something different. I waited until he finished<br/>\nthrowing and then turned to him and said, &quot;I am angry and mad&quot;. I stamped on<br/>\nthe floor and acted slightly angry. His eyes were wide open with surprise<br/>\nbecause &quot;mommy&quot; never behaved that way before. I turned to him at that point<br/>\nand said, &quot;You know what I am going to do? When I am mad, I draw big black<br/>\nlines&quot;. I grabbed paper and crayons and proceeded. He watched. This strategy<br/>\nhelped for a while to change how he expressed his anger because after that I<br/>\nwas able to grab a crayon and paper and give it to him when he had a<br/>\ntantrum. I wanted to let him work through his anger in a way that our family<br/>\ncould handle. This helped for a while. When he was between 3 and 4, he still<br/>\nhad temper tantrums but stopped throwing objects. One day, I cried with him.<br/>\nWhen I had his attention, I was straight with him. I told him that when he<br/>\nwas in emotional pain, I was too because I had no idea how to help him. I<br/>\nasked him if he could tell me how to him when he are not happy? He actually<br/>\ncalmed himself down to answer me. That was the turning point for him (as<br/>\nwell as for me). I knew then he had reached the level of maturity to control<br/>\nhis anger. He did share strategies that he wanted me to use to comfort him.<br/>\nRarely did he have tantrums after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my approaches will give your sister ideas to consider that may work<br/>\nwith your niece. In my opinion, the first and important thing your daughter<br/>\nneeds to learn is a more appropriate way of dealing with her anger. She<br/>\nneeds to know that her feelings are ok but not the manner she is expressing<br/>\nit. She needs to know that her mother wants to be there for her, love her,<br/>\nand guide her. When children are angry, it scares them because they feel<br/>\nthis anger take control and that is scary. They sometimes need help and<br/>\nguidance so that they learn how to manage those feelings so that they are<br/>\nstill in control of their mind and bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is my two cents. Hope it generates ideas for your sister and their<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI- I am new to this board but not new to unschooling.

Anyone hitting is wrong.  This child is doing it repeatedly and <br/>\naccording to what was said here, not wanting to hear that this behavior <br/>\nis not acceptable.

At four mom (or dad as mom is pg) <br/>\ncan pick up Drue and take her to the other room physically.  When Drue <br/>\nis hitting an adult can pick her up and hold her lovingly but firmly and <br/>\nsay &#39;we don&#39;t hit in this house, period.&quot; repeating that until Drue is <br/>\nunder control.  And when Drue is not hitting they can reinforce that <br/>\nbehavior as well, and spend lots of time with her, giving her time to <br/>\nvent her emotions and concerns.  Play therapy could really help this <br/>\nchild get past this difficult time in her life. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and she was marginalized.  She&#39;s about to be<br/>\n&gt; #3 on the priorities list, not the smaller (need- and attention-wise) <br/>\n&gt; of two,<br/>\n&gt; but of three.  She might feel like she&#39;s about to disappear.   That&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; &quot;crap.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, her feelings and needs are not crap.  However, her reaction to that <br/>\nmight be considered that.  Again, not the word I would use, but <br/>\nregardless of the word, the behavior is not acceptable!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Drue doesn&#39;t get a choice in the decision for another family member, <br/>\n&gt; so no<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; should make like she does. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sounds like it&#39;s okay for decisions to be made for HER, though by <br/>\n&gt; everyone<br/>\n&gt; else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She can get to help make whatever decisions her parents decide she can <br/>\n&gt; make. <br/>\n&gt; There are people who have had other children or not, based in part <br/>\n&gt; from input<br/>\n&gt; of their existing children.  That&#39;s not crap either.

As I first read it, I<br/>\nthought the people were a bunch of over-sensitive whiners.  I grew up in a<br/>\nfamily of 9 and don&#39;t remember any of those thoughts.  I always knew my<br/>\nfolks loved me...how could they not??  I&#39;m wonderful!!  But as I read more<br/>\nin the book, I realized that lots of those thoughts and feelings might have<br/>\nbeen experienced by my siblings.  I haven&#39;t asked them, but I&#39;d bet money<br/>\nthat some of it applied.  I took a few good things away from that<br/>\nbook....things that seemed at first to be ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell from the message, but was Drue &quot;coddled&quot; when Declan arrived?<br/>\nDid Mom and Dad promise that they still loved her and they would still have<br/>\ntheir time together?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids come along, we don&#39;t talk about that stuff.  We tell them that<br/>\nthere&#39;s a new baby coming and isn&#39;t that wonderful.  We talk about all the<br/>\nthings they&#39;ll be able to teach the baby and how much more love we&#39;ll have<br/>\nin the family.  My kids know that love multiplies, it doesn&#39;t get divided.<br/>\nThey also know that *time* gets divided and shared and that that&#39;s just a<br/>\nfact of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time I hear something like, &quot;I hate him!  I wish he were never<br/>\nborn!!&quot; is when they are really mad or if a young&#39;un has just kicked over<br/>\nthe chinese checkers game (again).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who has two kids and they have done the &quot;this new baby won&#39;t<br/>\nreplace you in my heart&quot; routine.  The girls do get along well, but there is<br/>\na constant jealous undertone.  Now there is another baby on the way and all<br/>\nthe concern is there again, making the problem bigger than it needs to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just anecdotal evidence, but I think that if parents make a big deal<br/>\nout of the negatives of a new family member, even by reiterating the<br/>\npositive ways to counteract the negatives, the child will seize on the<br/>\nnegatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer parents are going to have to quit putting up with Drue&#39;s crap.  She can<br/>\nhave all the feelings that she wants, but when it comes to others in the<br/>\nfamily, especially those younger and weaker than she is, she needs to shape<br/>\nup.  I think that having her own room doesn&#39;t help matters much.  Drue<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get a choice in the decision for another family member, so no one<br/>\nshould make like she does.  That&#39;s unfair to all concerned.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nthis child&#39;s behavior can be changed without some serious effort on the<br/>\nparents&#39; part.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Siblings","postDate":"1065901353","msgId":82754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYTMwMWMzOTAyZiRkMjg0YjE0MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNGODg1OEI5LjEwNTA5MDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":82753,"nextInTopic":82755,"prevInTime":82753,"nextInTime":82755,"topicId":2336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I guess I would take a two fold approach.  I would <br/>\nfirst make it so she could not be in the same room or within a few feet <br/>\nof her brother without someone touching her, even if it is simply they <br/>\nare holding her hand or holding her in their lap.  THere are times when <br/>\nmy two girls are constantly bickering (although they rarely hit, <br/>\nsometimes they pinch or violate each other&#39;s physical space with their <br/>\nfeet, etc.) and I simply say it sounds like you both need some time away <br/>\nfrom each other, so for a while you are not allowed in the same room.  <br/>\nThey are a bit older by my five year old understands this so I think <br/>\nmost four year olds would understand.  After a few hours of being told <br/>\nthey can&#39;t be in the same room they are begging to play with each other <br/>\nagain.   The two children just simply should not be in the same room <br/>\nunless there is constant, immediate supervision, with mom or another <br/>\nadult right there.  It sounds like the two share a room, and if possible <br/>\nthat should end.  If not, then the parents need to make sure both are <br/>\nasleep before letting them share a room.  The 2 year old can go to sleep <br/>\nin mom&#39;s room until the 4 year old is asleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there is something making this little girl very angry and the <br/>\nparents need to figure it out.  If there is a good play therapist around <br/>\na few visits might not hurt, especially with a new baby on the way.  <br/>\nAlso mom (and dad)  needs to find time to spend with each child alone, <br/>\nat least 30 minutes a day and a longer time on the weekend.  My parents <br/>\nused to have Saturday be my day and Sunday be my sister&#39;s day.  This was <br/>\nwith my mom while the other kids were with my dad, but the next weekend <br/>\nit would be dad&#39;s turn to take me out while my sister and brother stayed <br/>\nwith my mom.  My brother had a day too, I&#39;m sure.  (Just so you dont&#39; <br/>\nthink my parents ignored him).  But anyway, it really helped to have <br/>\nthat alone time.  During the week we&#39;d read, talk, etc.  At four some of <br/>\nthe best times I had with my daughter was when she was taking a bath and <br/>\nright before bed.  Lots of one on one and talking without other things <br/>\nto do or distractions. Letting the child pick the activity, but <br/>\nencouraging activities (likes walks, book reading, etc.) that allow lots <br/>\nof talking, holding hands, cuddling. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere area  lot of good books about new siblings.  And books about angry <br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and if the parents spank, it&#39;s time to stop and never spank again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis little girl is very unhappy and stressed.

She has two kids,<br/>\nDrue who is four, and Declan who is two.   She is expecting another baby<br/>\n(and Drue has said that she&#39;s not happy about it and that she wants my<br/>\nsister to herself).  From here on I&#39;m quoting my sister:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is unheard of for a day to go by without her hitting, punching, kicking,<br/>\nand yelling. She is soooooo mean to him. When we try to talk to her she says<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not listening to you at all&quot;. She gets mad at him for everything. If he<br/>\ncomes in their room she flips out for him to get out. She will punch him so<br/>\nfast and hard before I can stop her. If he looks at a toy she&#39;s<br/>\nholding...BAM. We don&#39;t know what to do. He is so sweet to her, too. Any<br/>\nideas? &quot;<br/>\n~Rue</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Becky Wollenslegel","from":"&quot;Becky Wollenslegel&quot; &lt;beckycraigw12@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"tiRJ6NBgclYB2ZtOkGbavnxxXZkAOCS-ZJiKTuyj2soeP5sBBLeqROX-LR_jY3l709vHHbr7SvK69GM2tN9SITvwc8LFOjS9QEWrr-HehcQfL3aZJqHC4T4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Siblings","postDate":"935757304","msgId":2336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNzMuMjMzNi45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":82729,"prevInTime":2335,"nextInTime":2337,"topicId":2336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Susan!

You said:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been lurking....things have been SO crazy here....but I just had to<br/>\nditto Jill&#39;s message.  People assume a big negative for me with HS is not<br/>\ngetting a break from the children.  I find I&#39;m worn out from the baby and<br/>\npreschool age child....But I LOVE having my 7.5 year old around.  It&#39;s a joy<br/>\nto have her be here and stay closely connected to her younger siblings<br/>\nrather than being pulled into the &#39;world of school&#39;  while the little ones<br/>\nare home.  And she and I have learned to give each other space and &#39;breaks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo true!<br/>\nOne of the reason my daughter - at 9th grade- decided to homeschool was<br/>\nbecause she had seen the bond between her brothers (12yo & 1yo) grow and she<br/>\nfelt left out.  The baby really didn&#39;t know her!  The boys are still very<br/>\nclose (at 18 & 7) in spite of the age differance.  Although when Cole asked<br/>\nlast night if he had plans for 5:00, Cody replied &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;  I guess<br/>\nhe&#39;s learning that sometimes older brothers will offer activities that are<br/>\nmore work than fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nBecky in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82825,"nextTopicId":82833}}
