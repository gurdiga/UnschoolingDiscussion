I went to al-anon <br/>\nfor awhile and never heard about the reparenting thing, but it&#39;s sort of what <br/>\nI&#39;ve been doing! I had never heard of it before so it&#39;s so validating to hear <br/>\nabout it. I just sorta figured that as my son grows, I&#39;ll be reminded and put <br/>\nin touch with all the yucky stuff from my own childhood, at each age and <br/>\nstep. And taking different routes and making different choices is healing for <br/>\nme, and gives me great confidence that I&#39;m not repeating the pattern onto my <br/>\nown child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also found that I do repeat my own patterns unless I&#39;m being <br/>\nconscious. I cannot make different choices if I&#39;m not actively working on my <br/>\nissues, and while I&#39;m giving my son everything I can, he&#39;s giving me more <br/>\nthan I ever dreamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to thank you and share a bit. I&#39;m not that great at <br/>\narticulating my own thoughts and process so hope it makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to add that al-anon produces lots of literature. You can attend <br/>\none meeting and take a few books home with no pressure. I have two little day <br/>\nby day books that I read from time to time. Esp. the &#39;courage to change&#39; <br/>\nbook. While I&#39;m no longer in psycho relationships, ideas like detachment from <br/>\noutcomes, gratitude, self-love, etc. are always good reminders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also learned a lot from a book called &#39;It could never happen to me&quot; by <br/>\nClaudia Black. Really outlined the different routes of behavior taken by <br/>\nchildren in homes with addiction, from the unproductive addict to the super <br/>\nachiever workaholic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26149,"nextTopicId":24243}}
