Holly aimed a toy gun at me <br/>\nand fired it, and I said, &quot;I don&#39;t like that at all, Holly.&quot;  She asked why, <br/>\nand I said it was always the rule that you could only shoot at someone who was <br/>\nalso playing.  Then I realized she was never a gun-playing little kid, and <br/>\nthat it had been fifteen years ago since that rule was in effect.  &quot;Same as <br/>\nboffers,&quot; I said.  &quot;You don&#39;t hit someone who&#39;s not also holding a boffer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that&#39;s just common sense, isn&#39;t it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was the same as the principle (couldn&#39;t have been a rule, but it was <br/>\ndiscussed when applicable) that it&#39;s only playing if everyone&#39;s playing.  As soon <br/>\nas someone&#39;s not having fun anymore (feelings are hurt, wants to quit for any <br/>\nreason) the other person can&#39;t say &quot;I was only playing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the other person isn&#39;t engaged in the game (whether boffers, toy guns, <br/>\nwater play, wrestling, teasing) then he&#39;s not fair game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99771,"nextTopicId":99819}}
