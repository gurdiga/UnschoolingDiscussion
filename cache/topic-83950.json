Our kids create impromptu and elaborate costumes non-stop <br/>\naround here, but the stuff they run into one the tele-tube, in the <br/>\nnight, the mall or even the grocery store (the management and clerks <br/>\nhave both been known to go overboard with the gorey masks and <br/>\nmakeup) on Halloween and long beforehand gives &#39;em the heebie-<br/>\njeebies.  A few years back two of our neighbors decorated their <br/>\nyards -- one with a guillotine complete with the trimmings and one <br/>\nwith a monster mask.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time we went out to the van to run errands, the displays <br/>\ncaught the eye -- you had to make a real effort to avoid this scene <br/>\nfor an entire month.  Forget playing out in the front yard and the <br/>\nwindow/shelf displays everywhere accost them, too.  Both of these <br/>\nfamilies had young daughters (under six) whose elementary school bus <br/>\nrode by those yard decorations every day, and one of them actually <br/>\ntold us her mother had refused to take her trick or treating that <br/>\nyear because she&#39;d been disturbed all night dealing with nightmares <br/>\nafter the last fright fest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that sounds a little sensitive and paranoid, but I never <br/>\nliked that kind of thing when I was a kid growing up in the sixties, <br/>\neither, and still don&#39;t.  Scariest thing I remember was the older <br/>\nteenagers who refused to grow up and cut in on our scene with a bad <br/>\nhippy costume and a smiley face button :o) One of the aliens on a <br/>\nreally lame episode of Star Trek still runs through my mind, too.  <br/>\nWe dressed up as &quot;cute&quot; witches and ghosts, not gorey goblins from <br/>\nanother galaxy and it was considered tacky to go to somebody else&#39;s <br/>\nneighborhood to trick or treat unless you lived out in the boonies.  <br/>\nIn that case, you hooked up with a school friend _and_ their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s always Mardi Gras (which has more goodies but can <br/>\nget off the wall) and Highland Games/Caleidh, Civil War (Re-<br/>\nenactment-toddlers don&#39;t like seeing people get shot and <br/>\nmaimed)/Antebellum Balls and the Society for Creative Anachronism, <br/>\nto name a few other &quot;costume parties&quot; out there which can substitute <br/>\nfor Halloween if need be.  The possibilities are endless... not to <br/>\nmention that we live in the land of make-believe here in central <br/>\nFlorida, so there&#39;s never a lack of opportunity in that department.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoyed the thread ... gotta go help my son finish his new kilt (we <br/>\ngot some genuine Clan Davidson tartan for his birthday) before the <br/>\nGames and holiday parties.  Our daughter picked up a pattern for <br/>\nScarlett O&#39;Hara&#39;s barbeque dress when she and her sister <br/>\nparticipated in the Junior Belle program -- strolling the grounds in <br/>\nantebellum gowns for a couple of hours at Cypress Gardens -- before <br/>\nthey closed the park down for lack of funds.

Didn&#39;t mean for it to come across that way -- but <br/>\nusing a religious quote in any context frightens people more often <br/>\nthan a ghost story around the campfire.  Although my own &quot;hope&quot; is <br/>\nbased in Christian Science (CS), I was thinking more along the lines <br/>\nof the description of the list on Unschooling.com, which is all-<br/>\ninclusive of the worldwide range of conversation we shared way back <br/>\non HEM&#39;s first e-mail list.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was Earl Gary Stevens who first started mapping out the <br/>\nparticipants -- we had between 50 and 200 max on the listserv back <br/>\nthen, if I recall correctly, from all points of the States and <br/>\naround the globe.  We were awestruck by the magnitude of the <br/>\nInternet and its capabilities for networking back then -- little did <br/>\nwe know! <br/>\n<br/>\n***Unschooling.com&#39;s e-mail list, a hotbed of conversation. No set <br/>\ntopics, pretty much anything related to unschooling goes- and we all <br/>\nknow that means just about everything! Another good way to get to <br/>\nknow other people, and share opinions and information about all <br/>\nsorts of things.*** <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd well do we understand that the &quot;reason for the hope within&quot; <br/>\nvaries just as widely as the locales of the unschooling crowd -- in <br/>\nfact, that&#39;s how we first found out about Taking Children Seriously <br/>\nand other wonderful ways of trusting each other.  One of the best <br/>\nthings we learned about CS is that so-called age and status are <br/>\nbasically irrelevant -- it&#39;s more about stages of growth, not <br/>\nphysical but spiritual (which again is individual according to <br/>\nbelief,) and in all fairness -- autodidacts of all ages/stages can <br/>\nand should be trusted to direct their own education in the world and <br/>\nreason with confidence on relevant topics without fear of judgment <br/>\nor censorship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSimply stated, thanks for trusting us enough to pass the post along <br/>\nto the group despite &quot;off-topic&quot; appearances and offering us a <br/>\nchance to clarify.

That <br/>\nmay be where some of the confusion came about with the Nicaean <br/>\nCouncil&#39;s conclusion a few hundred years after Jesus&#39; departure.   <br/>\nMrs. Eddy explained that Christ was originally used as an honorary <br/>\ntitle for Jesus, as in Jesus _the_ Christ or Christ Jesus, rather <br/>\nthan a synonym or &quot;surname.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nFascinating stuff for a conventionally-raised Christian.  MBE&#39;s <br/>\nbook, _Science & Health with Key to the Scriptures_ (S&H) is now my <br/>\nall-time favorite companion to the Bible (and yes, I prefer the KJV <br/>\nover the other interpretations, although they&#39;ve all got their <br/>\nflaws.)  Not to come across as a thumper or anything, but I&#39;m one of <br/>\nthose who can claim to have been healed while reading this book.  A <br/>\ndecade&#39;s worth of suffering the heartbreak of progressively <br/>\ncrippling psoriasis simply began to fade away before I even noticed <br/>\nit -- that was nine years ago this fall to be exact and I&#39;m still <br/>\ntrying to find the answer to that (divinely natural) miracle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll never believe it was a mere coincidence, although I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nevery excuse to refute that CS is legit or this particular disease <br/>\nwas incurable as the doctors all said.  It was certainly a miserable <br/>\nburden before I found CS, so I gotta give credit where credit&#39;s <br/>\ndue.  The last chapter of S&H is filled with testimonies from others <br/>\nwho were healed in the same way, and according to the record (over <br/>\n125 years since S&H was first published,) CS has been known to cure <br/>\nevery known disease on the planet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that I can type on this keyboard (when I could barely hold <br/>\na pencil or dress myself) is living proof to me that there is always <br/>\nhope, with a whole lotta faith (understanding, not blind) and love <br/>\nin the mix.  There&#39;s a lot of mind over matter lit out there, but <br/>\nS&H is the only one that I&#39;ve found which wholly gives the power to <br/>\nheal to the one Mind, God.  Mrs. Eddy is also the only one whom <br/>\nwe&#39;ve found to uphold John&#39;s statement that &quot;God is Love&quot; (not <br/>\nsubject to human whims, weaknesses, or temper tantrums, but only <br/>\nfound to be practicing parental perfection, i.e. Love.)  If that&#39;s <br/>\nnot Taking Children Seriously, nothing is!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter nearly ten years, I&#39;m still hooked on CS if you can&#39;t tell!  I <br/>\nlove to hear other&#39;s &quot;reason for the hope within,&quot; especially with <br/>\nall the frightening mess going on in the world.  This is where CS <br/>\nhas its finest hour -- allaying fears of all magnitudes -- and <br/>\nthat&#39;s what heals not only individual physical challenges, but <br/>\nspiritual and moral dis-ease on a universal basis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt really doesn&#39;t matter whether Halloween is classified as pagan or <br/>\nChristian, hacker or terrorist fodder -- it&#39;s basically a fright <br/>\nnight.  Some think that&#39;s a good/holy/fun thing, depending on their <br/>\nbasic beliefs.  Personally blood and gore, etc., grosses me out, <br/>\nfaked or otherwise, and the kids feel the same way -- so we try to <br/>\navoid it as much as possible.  The non-stop graphic advertisements <br/>\nconvinced us to turn off the tube years ago.  At least we have a <br/>\nlittle more control over this medium, but it&#39;s becoming a real toss-<br/>\nup with all the invasive pop-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of this lengthy three-in-one post as my way of saying we&#39;ve <br/>\nmissed the unschooling crowd and Sandra Dodd&#39;s words of wisdom -- so <br/>\nglad to have caught up with everybuddy on the forum.  Thanks for <br/>\nposting my message as a &quot;newbie&quot; unschooling veteran (is that an <br/>\noxymoron? :o) We&#39;re still looking through the responses to the <br/>\ndriver&#39;s dilemma.  If only Yahoo! hadn&#39;t removed the &quot;Reply to <br/>\nMessage#&quot; reference link at the bottom of the posts -- makes it <br/>\ntough to review the history of a topic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally figured out that the Digests were the source of many <br/>\nreplies, so decided the search engine was my best bet (thank <br/>\ngoodness Yahoo! finally added this feature!)  Guess our son will <br/>\nfeel better about moving back to FL once he hears about the new law <br/>\nin SC (or not!) He has been lamenting that we left just a few months <br/>\nbefore he turned fifteen since his birthday in September.  Still it <br/>\nwould&#39;ve taken another year to get a full-fledged license (albeit <br/>\nrestricted) that would transfer over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeard from the Senator&#39;s assistant after posting -- typical &quot;It&#39;s <br/>\nthe law, conform or get over it&quot; response, but she said she&#39;d pass <br/>\nour concerns along to the ever-so-busy legislators.  Is Pat <br/>\nMontgomery out of the country?  I expected to hear from someone at <br/>\nClonlara by now.

No dressing up; no begging for candy; no handing out<br/>\ncandy (or anything else) If it isn&#39;t, then why make up some<br/>\nbig &quot;baptized&quot; version of it? sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree; if Christians are going to define Halloween as evil, they shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave anything to do with it at all.  Doing so &quot;compromises&quot; your belief<br/>\nsystem, in my opinion.  However, so many Christians believe so many<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\nthings, such as total immersion baptism or sprinkling of water - what about<br/>\nbabies<br/>\nbeing baptized?  There&#39;s a hot topic with Christians.  Oh, here&#39; s a really<br/>\nhot<br/>\ntopic-once saved always saved???  I think God looks at our hearts and the<br/>\nintent we have when we commit an act.  The Bible is too conflicting in its&#39;<br/>\nstatements.  You can support each idea by searching through Scriptures and<br/>\ntaking<br/>\nthem out of context-sometimes even in context.  I personally don&#39;t look at<br/>\nHalloween as evil.  To my family, it is just a fun time to dress up and go<br/>\ntrick-or-treating.  And I even let my kids be whatever they want to be,<br/>\nwhether it is<br/>\na witch, a demon, a ghost-whatever.  For this reason, we don&#39;t go to church<br/>\nfall festivals.  If you want to welcome people I don&#39;t believe you can put<br/>\nstipulations on the welcome mat.  At least not at church.  In my own home,<br/>\nI&#39;ll<br/>\ndecide what parameters I want.  As I write that it sounds like a double<br/>\nstandard, but I reason it with &quot;but I&#39;m not God.  I&#39;m not all forgiving and<br/>\nall loving<br/>\nand all accepting.  I&#39;m not willing to die on the cross for the entire<br/>\nworld.&quot;  Does that make sense, or am I making excuses?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 7<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 05 Nov 2003 21:40:53 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: on candy and other  limits<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah!

(and can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the title. It is a scholarly, historian thing. Like, a PhD<br/>\nthesis or something. 500 pages + ) The Reformers wanted Christians to<br/>\nmake a clean break from R Catholicism; therefore, they stigmatized<br/>\nvarious Catholic practices by saying they came from paganism.<br/>\nAccording to this essay, archaeological data indicates that many of<br/>\nthese traditions didn&#39;t come into practice until after Christianity<br/>\ngot into an area. I&#39;ll try and remember specifics. The Yule Log was<br/>\none of the &quot;pagan practices&quot; debunked in the book. sheesh. can&#39;t<br/>\nremember, but Christian feast days coming from paganism or not, isn&#39;t<br/>\nmy main point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF Christian traditions come from paganism, my question just takes on<br/>\nmore weight. Why is Halloween evil (and it IS considered evil by many<br/>\nChristians. Take my word on that one. One of my best friends won&#39;t do<br/>\ntrick or treating, and another one completely ignores the day...) Why<br/>\nis All Hallow&#39;s Eve considered evil, and to be shunned, when<br/>\nChristmas and Easter are embraced? IF they come from pagan practices,<br/>\nwe should shun all of it. And in fact, the Reformers and their<br/>\nfollowers DID. Christmas was illegal in Puritan America. The<br/>\nbook &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; was written by the Puritan Daniel Defoe. He<br/>\nmakes a point of ignoring Dec. 25. by having the main character mark<br/>\noff days on his calendar and pointedly having Dec. 25 be just another<br/>\nday, nothing special.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Puritans tried to rename the days of the week, even. Sunday being<br/>\nnamed after the Sun, Monday after the Moon, and so forth. Can&#39;t have<br/>\nTHAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Hallowe&#39;en is evil, having come from paganism, then we must follow<br/>\nthrough on our logic and ban other Christian high holy days. But<br/>\ntoday&#39;s Christians don&#39;t follow through. They just consider<br/>\nHallowe&#39;en evil, but only certain parts of it, like trick or<br/>\ntreating. They allow the dressing up and the candy, but ban the trick<br/>\nor treating...or, just put it in the church basement or parking lot.<br/>\nAnd they never think twice about Christmas and Easter or the origin<br/>\nof any other tradition.<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.
