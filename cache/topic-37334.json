She was around a lot of guns. She went to the range, she<br/>\nsaw (and heard) them fired (with eye and ear protection on, of course),<br/>\nand I think we even shot up a watermelon with her. I had a target I&#39;d<br/>\nshot hanging on ther back of my bedroom door. She knew what guns did. To<br/>\nthis day, I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;d never point a gun at anyone unless she<br/>\nmeant to kill them, since that was the rule everyone followed. She had<br/>\ntoy guns, of course, but those were different, it was pretty easy to tell<br/>\nthe difference. We showed her our guns, took them apart, let her hold<br/>\nthem, talked about how a gun could look unloaded but there could be a<br/>\nbullet in the chamber... she really did get all this. I truly think a<br/>\nshooting range or a practical pistol competition can be a great trip for<br/>\na little kid... the people there are very serious about gun safety, they<br/>\nreally respect the power of their firearms.<br/>\n<br/>\nRain also watched &quot;blood and gore&quot; movies when she was little...<br/>\nDragonheart and Jurassic Park at 2 or 3, Star Wars, all that stuff. I<br/>\nremember playing &quot;making a movie&quot; with her when she was 3. We&#39;d act out a<br/>\nscene together, usually involving violence or death, and then yell &quot;Cut!&quot;<br/>\nand whoever was dead or injured would jump up and we&#39;d high-five each<br/>\nother and say &quot;Great job!&quot;. It was pretend...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 5 I got a scanner, and we scanned in all sorts of photos and<br/>\ncut and pasted and did weird things, like showing her riding a giant cat.<br/>\nEven back then we talked about how the movie&#39;s special effects might have<br/>\nbeen created, just throwing out ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\nRain&#39;s nephew came out to visit us a year ago, when he was 2 1/2, and he<br/>\nloved to watch our Jurassic Park and Land of the Lost videos... &quot;Watcha<br/>\ndinosaur movie?&quot; was his big line. His mom (Rain&#39;s sister) said they<br/>\nowned the Making of Jurassic Park video, and the first time he saw that<br/>\nhe was just enthralled...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\nThey think they&#39;re for the purpose of blowing people <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; away, if that&#39;s what they&#39;re first impressions of gun use is.

So you sit and tell <br/>\n&gt; them that it isn&#39;t real this is MAKE-BELIEVE??  But in these movies <br/>\n&gt; these are real people and real guns that they&#39;re seeing and I cannot <br/>\n&gt; believe that a four year old can reason that well as to draw a line <br/>\n&gt; between what they&#39;re watching and what&#39;s real or make-believe?<br/>\n&gt;   I don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic or offensive if I come off sounding <br/>\n&gt; that way, I apologize.

The way I see it now that I have examined the issue<br/>\nmore closely in our own home is that I trust my son and I know who he<br/>\nis.  He is a gentle boy who takes the trouble to avoid accidentally<br/>\nstepping on bugs outside, shows extreme compassion to me and animals and<br/>\nhis friends, has never (even as a toddler) hit anyone, and is fascinated<br/>\nwith guns and lasers and weapons in general.  What is that?  I&#39;m beginning<br/>\nto believe it is some biological urge boys have, but whatever it is I<br/>\ncannot deny it and I cannot make it go away by pretending he doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nguns, etc., and wishing he were more like me.   For years I would not<br/>\n*allow* toy guns in the house, but  sword were okay.  I told him that<br/>\nswords and knifes could also be useful tools (cutting an apple on a hike,<br/>\netc.) but that there were no good uses for guns, which were only meant to<br/>\nkill animals and people.  Well, he heard me, but that did not change his<br/>\nurges or his fascinations.  I have lifted the weapons ban at home, and Liam<br/>\nis as happy as ever, and is still a gentle, loving boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was running the risk of making Liam feel badly for this natural urge he<br/>\nwas feeling.  And, I ran the risk of alienating him.  Again, this was not<br/>\nthe desired effect I had in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that when you have an open, honest relationship with your kids, you<br/>\ncan talk about ANYTHING, and they will know you are speaking from an honest<br/>\nplace.  Kids really appreciate our honesty and frankness and trust.  I<br/>\nappreciate it when people approach me in that way.  It shows me that I am<br/>\nrespected for my intelligence and ability to handle things.  When someone<br/>\nshows me that they think I can handle stuff, it behooves me to rise to the<br/>\noccasion.  But, it&#39;s not all or nothing.  You don&#39;t have to sit a<br/>\n4-year-old in front of Die Hard.  Neither do you have to sequester them<br/>\nfrom our world.  There&#39;s a middle ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes sense!

Nor is the &quot;no violent games or movies&quot; the answer<br/>\nto every family with a 4 yo. Every family situation is different and the<br/>\nanswer is to look at the situation objectively and make decisions that are<br/>\nappropriate to that particular situation, rather than grasping at a one size<br/>\nfits all decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing these games are being played by the older kids in the family<br/>\nand the boy is drawn to them. Forbidding him from interacting with his<br/>\nbrothers while they get to play would just make whatever is attracting him<br/>\nall the more enticing.

I think<br/>\nthat a four year old is capapble of understanding fiction vs. reality<br/>\nand death.<br/>\nBut I agree that if a parent can&#39;t figure out how to explain it, she<br/>\nshould avoid exposing her child to it.  I like the traffic analogy.  I<br/>\nam also very concerned about the gun aspect.  If a child sees these<br/>\nmovies with no input from parents and then finds a gun at a relatives<br/>\nhouse, he may point and shoot it because he thinks the person will get<br/>\nright back up.  So I think it is very important to get that &#39;guns are<br/>\nnot benign things&#39; through as soon as the child starts to be<br/>\ninterested in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget - somewhere on the fence in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Betty Holder&quot; &lt;ninnyridge03@p...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Whoa!!

The way I see it now that I have examined the issue <br/>\nmore closely in our own home is that I trust my son and I know who he <br/>\nis.  He is a gentle boy who takes the trouble to avoid accidentally <br/>\nstepping on bugs outside, shows extreme compassion to me and animals and <br/>\nhis friends, has never (even as a toddler) hit anyone, and is fascinated <br/>\nwith guns and lasers and weapons in general.  What is that?  I&#39;m beginning <br/>\nto believe it is some biological urge boys have, but whatever it is I <br/>\ncannot deny it and I cannot make it go away by pretending he doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nguns, etc., and wishing he were more like me.   For years I would not <br/>\n*allow* toy guns in the house, but  sword were okay.  I told him that <br/>\nswords and knifes could also be useful tools (cutting an apple on a hike, <br/>\netc.) but that there were no good uses for guns, which were only meant to <br/>\nkill animals and people.  Well, he heard me, but that did not change his <br/>\nurges or his fascinations.  I have lifted the weapons ban at home, and Liam <br/>\nis as happy as ever, and is still a gentle, loving boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was running the risk of making Liam feel badly for this natural urge he <br/>\nwas feeling.  And, I ran the risk of alienating him.  Again, this was not <br/>\nthe desired effect I had in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that when you have an open, honest relationship with your kids, you <br/>\ncan talk about ANYTHING, and they will know you are speaking from an honest <br/>\nplace.  Kids really appreciate our honesty and frankness and trust.  I <br/>\nappreciate it when people approach me in that way.  It shows me that I am <br/>\nrespected for my intelligence and ability to handle things.  When someone <br/>\nshows me that they think I can handle stuff, it behooves me to rise to the <br/>\noccasion.  But, it&#39;s not all or nothing.  You don&#39;t have to sit a <br/>\n4-year-old in front of Die Hard.  Neither do you have to sequester them <br/>\nfrom our world.  There&#39;s a middle ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes sense!

Mine saw Rocky Horror <br/>\nPicture Show (video) when they were little, but they could always get out of <br/>\nthe room, and they saw it for the goofy alien-nonsense rock and roll humor <br/>\nthat it was.  And the sex stuff they didn&#39;t pay any attention to because it <br/>\nmeant nothing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I hidden it or forbidden it, they might be studying it in secret today, <br/>\nbut they can sing some of the songs and not see it as an important or <br/>\npowerful or frightening thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I just can&#39;t see treating a four year old as you would an adult when it <br/>\ncomes to choosing what they watch. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t choose materials for adults to watch, so I&#39;m thinking your statement <br/>\nwasn&#39;t worded the way you meant for it to be.   I don&#39;t choose what my <br/>\nchildren watch, either, but I always gave them options.

None of them ever for a minute stared at a <br/>\nscary scene against their will.  None of them sought out disturbing movies.  <br/>\nThey watched things they liked.  LOTS of cartoons and musicals.  Pirates of <br/>\nPenzance was a favorite.  For a while Holly watched Stand By Me every day, <br/>\nsometimes twice.  She was little, maybe four.  Marty said I shouldn&#39;t let <br/>\nher.

I think <br/>\nthat a four year old is capapble of understanding fiction vs. reality <br/>\nand death.<br/>\nBut I agree that if a parent can&#39;t figure out how to explain it, she <br/>\nshould avoid exposing her child to it.  I like the traffic analogy.  I <br/>\nam also very concerned about the gun aspect.  If a child sees these <br/>\nmovies with no input from parents and then finds a gun at a relatives <br/>\nhouse, he may point and shoot it because he thinks the person will get <br/>\nright back up.  So I think it is very important to get that &#39;guns are <br/>\nnot benign things&#39; through as soon as the child starts to be <br/>\ninterested in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget - somewhere on the fence in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Betty Holder&quot; &lt;ninnyridge03@p...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Whoa!!   I must DISAGREE with this line of thinking!  IMO, a four <br/>\n </span></blockquote>year old should NOT be watching blood and gore movies and video games <br/>\nespecially if you have no clue as to how to teach one that young about <br/>\nthis. Why put yourself in the position of having to deal with it??   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Now come on folks, just because a four year old wants to do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>something, does not mean because we call ourselves UNSCHOOLERS we must <br/>\nbend over backwards to let this child DO what it wants.  If he wanted <br/>\nto go play in the traffic in the street , would you first explain to <br/>\nhim what the possibilities are of getting himself run over and how <br/>\ndangerous it is and then let him do it and hope for the best JUST <br/>\nbecause that what he &#39;s interested in??  Let&#39;s use a LITTLE bit of <br/>\ncommon sense! IF we say we have no clue how to teach this sort of <br/>\nthing to a child that age then do we just let them watch it and hope <br/>\nfor the best ?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Sorry, but even the  movie and video makers try to set limits on <br/>\n </span></blockquote>how much young children see. (By ratings of movies and video games) <br/>\nShouldn&#39;t we as loving parents, be even more cautious? <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I just can&#39;t see treating a four year old as you would an adult <br/>\n </span></blockquote>when it comes to choosing what they watch.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Am I the only one who feels this way about this?  If I am, then <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to sign off this list and go read a good book!!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   As for teaching them about guns, IMO, that is something that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>should be taught REALISTICALLY, NOT explained because they&#39;re exposed <br/>\na violent movie!  Movies nowadays (and video games) use guns to blow <br/>\naway anybody that gets in the way.  HOW can you let a small child <br/>\nwatch things like this and then try to explain to them the dangers of <br/>\nguns??????   They think they&#39;re for the purpose of blowing people <br/>\naway, if that&#39;s what they&#39;re first impressions of gun use is.  You <br/>\nmight talk your head off but as long as they sit and watch what guns <br/>\nare used for what are they going to believe??  So you sit and tell <br/>\nthem that it isn&#39;t real this is MAKE-BELIEVE??  But in these movies <br/>\nthese are real people and real guns that they&#39;re seeing and I cannot <br/>\nbelieve that a four year old can reason that well as to draw a line <br/>\nbetween what they&#39;re watching and what&#39;s real or make-believe?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic or offensive if I come off sounding <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that way, I apologize.  But I think we have to use some COMMON SENSE <br/>\nin raising our children!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Betty- yes, Mary, Life is GOOD!! <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37359,"nextTopicId":37401}}
