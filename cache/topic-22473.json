My older boys father is multiply guilty.  Nobody has suffered like he did.  He had the biggest mosquitoes to bite him. The meanest Dad. The worst everything.  Thanks.  What a good term  &quot;superior deprivation&quot;.  May I use it? Your use of language is wonderful.<br/>\nHowever, some dogs do bite bicycles, and cars and trucks!!  I have (1st person) seen a bulldog go round and round hanging onto the the front tire of moving car he bit! and wouldn&#39;t let go.  Dogs knocked into motorcycles causing crashes with my little brother...and they are aften big enough to jump up on the shoulders of a bicycle rider.  The ammonia in a squirt bottle that Lynda uses is a usefull idea.   We have done that since childhood.  Still, it isn&#39;t always enough re: the motocycle. And not all dogs will stop at a property line.  Especially ferral or semi-ferral  canines.  Dogs can be a realy danger!<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\nDogs don&#39;t bite bicycles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 <br/>\n<br/>\nI was asking for food and she was insulting me, and bragging <br/>\nup her superior deprivation to shame me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nI quit telling her I was hungry.

I <br/>\ncan&#39;t quite figure out where this post is going but I do know that chasing <br/>\ndogs do bite as that is quite frequently their objective in chasing.  Were <br/>\nthat not so, then the statement that followed (&quot;took down a calf&quot;) would be <br/>\nfalse.  In the interests of accuracy, chasing dogs do bite, they chase, they <br/>\nbite, the calf goes down.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the balance is what really leaves me somewhat perplexed.  The basic web <br/>\nof this fabric starts with an adult maybe, maybe not being bitten by a dog, <br/>\nprogresses to arguing the definitive value of the word &quot;severe,&quot; makes a <br/>\nrather extravagant leap to questioning motherly concerns over an injured <br/>\nchild and now progresses to a valuation on parenting.  Hmmm, most <br/>\ninteresting, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems a bit convaluted, and while I am sorry that some people have <br/>\nhorrendous childhood memories which seem to have left deep scars, it really <br/>\nhas no significance on what the previous poster said.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now that you are all wishing I would shut up and go back to lurking, I <br/>\ndo have one other comment on this situation.  While it may be true that the <br/>\nchildren &quot;don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; what the land is worth, it is also <br/>\ntrue that some of them are old enough to know and value the land and just <br/>\nmay, in fact, care about it and its value.  I would be inclined to think <br/>\nthat they do &quot;give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; over the press and folks labeling their <br/>\nmother as &quot;mentally ill&quot; and &quot;paranoid&quot; because she evidenced concern over <br/>\ntheir home being stolen.  And, I think that is where the concern in some <br/>\nposts came from, a defense of the mother&#39;s position.  Perhaps if some good <br/>\nsoul had taken the time to &quot;give a rat&#39;s patootie&quot; over this very issue <br/>\nbefore it ended up in the hands of the media the children&#39;s suffering would <br/>\nbe limited to that felt over the loss of a parent and they would not be <br/>\nsuffering the added burdens of fear and anguish over loosing their home and <br/>\nhaving their mother summarily and without due process taken from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Teri<br/>\nA good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the <br/>\ntruth about its author. -- G.
