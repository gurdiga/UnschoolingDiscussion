There <br/>\nare some people that will NEVER want to do this.  I have to respect <br/>\npeople&#39;s choices, particulary people whom I care about.  If someone <br/>\ncomplains I listen and try to offer them help or advice within <br/>\nthe &quot;school&quot; realm if I can think of something useful.  If their <br/>\nchild is going to stay in school than I certainly want to offer and <br/>\nhelp to make that as plesant as possible if I have any advice that <br/>\nis usable.   But I do start quite a few sentences with &quot;That was one <br/>\nreason we decided to keep Keiran at home..&quot;  Also, if I am having a <br/>\nbad day with my kids I would not want someone to say &quot;send them to <br/>\nschool&quot; or &quot;I told you so&quot; either so I am sure they feel the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, amycats2@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/12/2003 2:09:38 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n&gt; adonai@s... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; She doesn&#39;t believe in homeschooling so <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I just bite my tongue while she rants but I really want to <br/>\nsay &quot;Obviously, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there is an option!!&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Why does she call YOU?
