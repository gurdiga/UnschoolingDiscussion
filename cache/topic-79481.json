I will definitely try them out.  I LOVE French<br/>\nIn Action...took it in college.  I always sit to watch when I catch it on<br/>\ntv!\r<br/>\n    I deschooled back when we started four years ago.  Then it seemed like I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t deschool enough, so we did some more.  But these schoolish notions<br/>\nstill persist!  I think she is afraid to venture out on her own.  She went<br/>\nto school from Pre-K through 4th grade.  Alot of stuff already ingrained in<br/>\nher.  She loves anything to do with Ancient Egypt, so she is venturing out<br/>\nto learn all she can on that.  I am hoping she will gain confidence to<br/>\ncontinue to do so.\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79370,"nextTopicId":79451}}
