Today, I was SO thankful for <br/>\nthe &quot;cool&quot; weather &#39;cause I was in a wedding this afternoon that took place <br/>\noutside!  The heat broke just in time, and despite the cloudy skies, it was a <br/>\ngorgeous ceremony.  Only, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get that rain today.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my dh is going into the woods with some guys down in the Hill Country <br/>\nthis weekend.  Heat broke JUST in time!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  the San Marcos, Guadulupe and Frio Rivers are still running, which I&#39;m SO<br/>\n&gt;  surprised they haven&#39;t dried up ... I saw a report that the Blanco River <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  BONE DRY (I think it wsa the BR)???   AND SO MANY GRASS FIRES!!!  the<br/>\n&gt;  countryside is just PARCHED!!!  dh said he&#39;s really nervous b/c sparks from<br/>\n&gt;  the wheels of the train start fires all the time and MANY of the tankcars<br/>\n&gt;  are FLAMABLE materials; wellllllll great, that&#39;s just one more thing to<br/>\n&gt;  worry about while he&#39;s on the road :(<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hopefully, something will happen soon.  I&#39;m so darn tired of the sun!  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think we&#39;ll be making that tubing trip down the Guadulupe this year.  <br/>\nNow, we may walk down it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  btw ... since you are a Dallasonian do you know the name of the park/area<br/>\n&gt;  that has the dinosaur tracks located near Dallas???  we wanted to see this<br/>\n&gt;  next week but for the LIFE OF ME, I don&#39;t recall the name???  tia :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sure, you&#39;re talking about Dinosaur Valley State Park -- it&#39;s near Glen Rose, <br/>\nsouth of Cleburne.  You can get some information on the park and directions <br/>\nto it from the Texas Parks and Rec website:  www.tpwd.state.tx.us.   It is <br/>\npretty awesome to go down in the river bed and actually walk in the footsteps <br/>\nof dinosaurs.  Also in that area is the Rossil Rim Wildlife Center, a drive <br/>\nthrough wild animal park where you get to feed the animals from your car.  We <br/>\nreally like it there.  Try www.fossilrim.com.  But, that&#39;s all about 1 to 1 <br/>\n1/2 hours south of here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  *YES*, we almost had to pull air out our sweaters from mothballs today b/c<br/>\n&gt;  it *only* reached 96*!!!  ohhhhh, it felt GREAT ... it&#39;s funny how just 15*<br/>\n&gt;  LOWER helps you keep your SANITY!!! :}<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yea, I thought the same thing!  It was actually a pleasure taking the dog for <br/>\nhis walk this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck Grandma!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12995,"nextTopicId":12916}}
