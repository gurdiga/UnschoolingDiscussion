One case of paralytic poliomyelitis was<br/>\nreported in Peru in 1991.... Since that time the Americas have been<br/>\npolio-free. ... All cases of paralytic polio in this country since 1979<br/>\nwere either caused by the oral vaccine or contracted in a foreign<br/>\ncountry during travel. ... An average of 8 cases of vaccine-associated<br/>\nparalytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) occur each year in the United States....<br/>\nThe risk of acquiring wild polio in the United States is zero.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also states that polio can be contracted by contact with the feces of<br/>\na person recently vaccinated with the oral (live) vaccine. And, in<br/>\naddition to the neurological damage that any vaccine can cause, the<br/>\npolio vaccine has been implicated in the spread of certain monkey<br/>\nviruses, such as SIV - and may have been the cause of HIV (although the<br/>\nauthor does not directly state that). There IS a way to vaccinate for<br/>\npolio that is relatively safe, though, and involves two or more doses of<br/>\nthe killed vaccine followed by the oral (live) vaccine. <br/>\n<br/>\nScary stuff, here. The profit motive for pushing vaccines is huge, and<br/>\nthe fact that the very people who are profiting also have the power to<br/>\n*require* the whole population to consume their product... wow. <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13350,"nextTopicId":13353}}
