My son went through a<br/>\nterrible time with allergies when he was 4. I will always be grateful that<br/>\nhe was still nursing because there were times when there were so few foods<br/>\nhe could eat that we knew were safe, at least I knew he was getting great<br/>\nnutrition through the breastmilk (and since I also had a younger nursling,<br/>\nit was still plentiful at that age). Of course, it also meant that I had to<br/>\ngo on the same food-avoidance diet that he was on until we got his allergies<br/>\nfigured out, but that&#39;s a small sacrifice for some great peace of mind.<br/>\nI also have to wonder if his allergies, which sent us to the ER a couple of<br/>\ntimes, would&#39;ve been more severe, and thus even more life-threatening, if he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have several years of nursing beneath his belt.<br/>\nOne reason I hope my 3 y.o. doesn&#39;t wean any time soon is that there&#39;s some<br/>\npretty scary illnesses out there in the world. With something like West Nile<br/>\nvirus or SARS that have the potential to be deadly, maybe the fact that a<br/>\nchild was still nursing could make the difference between life and death.<br/>\nI&#39;ll never forget a woman on an email list whose child got E.Coli. She<br/>\nnursed him all the way through it, and it made a huge impact on how he made<br/>\nit through the course of the disease, esp. as that&#39;s another one that can<br/>\neasily kill small kids and toddlers.<br/>\nYou just can&#39;t go wrong with breastmilk, IMHO.

No ear <br/>\ninfections, no allergies of any kind, etc, is what I think is directly related to the <br/>\nbreastfeeding. I was breastfeed until I weaned myself, very healthy kid and <br/>\nadult, and still not ever allergic to a thing.

She&#39;s allergic to most meds, even the ones <br/>\npeople take who are allergic to other meds. When she gets sick, which is often, <br/>\nand always has been, the Drs. get nervous! (Now, I certainly don&#39;t mean there <br/>\nare not breastfeeding=healthy exceptions, going either way, obviously there <br/>\nare! AND the duration of breastfeeding plays a huge part too, as do other life <br/>\nstyle factors!) Anyway, breastfeeding does make you healthier and I mean a <br/>\n****life-long**** healthier - not just babies/kids.

I was worried I was starving them and I had major stomach pains <br/>\n(C-section landed me with an ileus sp both times) and ended up having my stay <br/>\nextended by 3 days with each of them.  That stay helped so much with the <br/>\nnursing.  Cassidy lost a few pounds but they said she prob. contained lots of <br/>\nfluids. She is now 75% percentile has been all along. Nicholas lost maybe a pound <br/>\nand is also around the 70%.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to nurse, so before I choose a doctor I also looked in to the <br/>\nhospital that I thought would support that and that also had lactation consultants <br/>\non staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a personal choice and some may not be able to or want to nurse.
