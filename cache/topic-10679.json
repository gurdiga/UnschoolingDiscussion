I&#39;m attaching the little<br/>\nsection in my book (&quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;) on Suzuki below.  I&#39;ll be<br/>\nhappy to e-mail the whole chapter (and the little appendix on &quot;How to Choose a<br/>\nMusic Teacher&quot;) to whomever asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I&#39;d add to what I wrote below is that it is somewhat rare to find<br/>\na real Suzuki teacher in the U.S., outside of major cities.  If you (as parent)<br/>\nare not required to take instruction separately from your child, you are not<br/>\ngetting Suzuki -- that is integral to the method, and in Japan, there is no<br/>\n&quot;Suzuki&quot; instruction without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I&#39;d add (which I say at length in Skylark), is that no method is<br/>\nthe right one if it doesn&#39;t take account of the particularities of your own<br/>\nchild. I began with a strong bias in favor of the Suzuki method (and am still<br/>\nbiased in its favor), and yet ended up with two musical children, for neither of<br/>\nwhom was Suzuki the best approach.  This is mainly because they didn&#39;t fit the<br/>\nprofile (as below.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll be happy to share more as needed.   (P.S. -- given other possible choices,<br/>\nI DON&#39;T recommend the violin for a child, unless she is REALLY committed to it<br/>\n-- of all instruments -- with the possible exception of the oboe as I have<br/>\nlearned from my older one -- it is the instrument least likely to provide quick<br/>\ngratification to the ear.  There are other, better choices for most young &#39;ums,<br/>\npiano being the first -- it is always in tune if you keep it that way, and your<br/>\nchild will be able to play a tune the first day!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Seeing and hearing Ali and our younger daughter Meera today, parents often ask<br/>\nour opinion of the Suzuki method.  This is despite the fact that neither of our<br/>\nchildren learned by utilizing it.  But for what it&#39;s worth, from what we know,<br/>\nwe look upon Suzuki quite favorably.  Firstly, it must be said that Suzuki is<br/>\nsingle-handedly responsible for hundreds or even thousands of string programs<br/>\nspringing up in elementary and middle schools across the country, which, for<br/>\nsome children, is the best experience they will ever have in school.  When Ellen<br/>\nand I were growing up, the violin was thought to be simply too difficult for all<br/>\nbut the most talented children.  Band instruments, pianos, or even, perish the<br/>\nthought, accordions! (I too have my own prejudices) were the recommended choices<br/>\nfor pre-teens.  Now we know, thanks to Suzuki, that stringed instruments can be<br/>\ntaught effectively to children at an early age.  Furthermore, recent brain<br/>\nresearch suggests that for a string player to have any real hopes of succeeding,<br/>\ninstruction should commence before age 12 (and preferably much earlier) to<br/>\nreinforce brain/fine-motor skill interactions.  I would note, however, that my<br/>\nown experience and that of the late John Holt, a founder of the modern<br/>\nhomeschooling movement who successfully took up the cello after age 40, are firm<br/>\nreminders that our early childhoods do not have to be the sole determinants of<br/>\nour musical destinies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, Suzuki insists on substantial parental involvement, more than just<br/>\ndriving one&#39;s child to and from lessons.  In some larger Suzuki schools<br/>\nincluding most of those in Japan, parents are required to attend their own<br/>\nclasses while their children are learning.  That level of parental commitment is<br/>\nsure to redound to the child&#39;s benefit, as is the creation of a musical<br/>\ncommunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thirdly, the early stages of Suzuki teaching focus on repetitive motion<br/>\ntraining.  It&#39;s rather like learning to throw a baseball the right way -- you&#39;re<br/>\nmore likely to get it if you do it a couple of thousand times.  Repetitive<br/>\nmotion training is particularly useful for the majority of children who are<br/>\nreasonably physically coordinated, have moderately good musical ears, but may<br/>\nnot yet be ready to tackle complex symbol systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourthly, the selections included in the well-edited Suzuki music books are<br/>\nmeticulously chosen to allow a child to progress and gain technical<br/>\nproficiency.  The accompanying music tapes provide an aural crutch and standard<br/>\nby which students can chart their own progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n Lastly, while there have been some notable exceptions, Suzuki was under no<br/>\nillusion that he was going to produce a bumper crop of virtuosi, though he<br/>\nsurely had his share.  His goal was to create a climate in which music could be<br/>\nbetter appreciated by young and old, and raise the general benchmark levels of<br/>\nmusical performance.  The major growth of community youth symphonies around the<br/>\nU.S. and the rest of the world, even at a time when general understanding and<br/>\nappreciation of classical music is on the decline, in part attests to Suzuki&#39;s<br/>\nsuccess.  If today I have a single quibble with the application of Suzuki&#39;s<br/>\nwork, it is with some Suzuki teachers who, at some remove from the master,<br/>\nelevate technique over musicianship, control and method over total involvement<br/>\nand the free flight of the child&#39;s imagination.  But then I wouldn&#39;t only say<br/>\nthat about Suzuki teachers!<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless of what we might think of Suzuki, after six months of sawing, Ali<br/>\ninformed us and her music teacher in no uncertain terms:  she wanted to read the<br/>\nnotes.  Out went Suzuki and in came Leopold Mozart, scales, and later, the<br/>\nprogressively more difficult exercise books....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nI will touring the East Coast September 1-19, giving homeschooling talks and<br/>\nworkshops related to &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;.
