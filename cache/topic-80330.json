The situation is much the same here in NC.

Play group is in the afternoon... <br/>\nit seems they limit a lot of &quot;field trips&quot; ( we just call them &quot;going to so <br/>\nand so&quot;..lol)  ..There is usually some curriculum, testing, grade level talk <br/>\namong the mothers, but Pam and I just kind of tune it out or nod and smile..   <br/>\nUntil unschooling becomes more popular around here, I guess she and I will just <br/>\ncontinue to be the wierd ones.. LOL.  It&#39;s funny though, because we think THEY <br/>\nare wierd..  Yesterday, a gorgeous day at the park..perfect weather.. One <br/>\nmother said they had to go home because her daughter didn&#39;t finish her school <br/>\nwork that morning.   And another mother promised her son a &quot;mega reward&quot; for <br/>\nreciting the American&#39;s Creed.
