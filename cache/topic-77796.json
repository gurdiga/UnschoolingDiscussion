But he was just<br/>\ngetting into Harry Potter when he got them a year and some ago, so they&#39;re<br/>\nalmost round.

I got<br/>\nteased a lot, and I was sure everybody was going to tease about them, except<br/>\nthat the most popular boy in my class got glasses the exact same day, and<br/>\nthat seemed to save me from most of it.  Actually, I loved my glasses; I<br/>\nnever knew I was supposed to be able to read what the teacher wrote on the<br/>\nchalkboard and see leaves on tall trees!

My boys used to get headaches, though, actually they still do.  Then they would want to come home to lay down.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Funny story about my daughter&#39;s first eye exam.  There was a bus from the Lion&#39;s Club giving free exams at a festival one day so I had my kids get their eyes tested.  My daughter was 4 at the time.  The man asked her to read the first line, she said she couldn&#39;t.  So he asked her to read the next line, she said she couldn&#39;t.  Then the third line, she couldn&#39;t.  So he got irritated at her and said, &quot;can&#39;t you just try!&quot;.  She answered, &quot;no, I can&#39;t read&quot;.  It was so funny.  I hadn&#39;t even thought about that when I put her on the list to be tested.  Obviously he didn&#39;t think about that either.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Crystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","profile":"amycats2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"glasses","postDate":"1059562751","msgId":77796,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4LjNiOWNkMzY1LjJjNThmZWZmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77799,"prevInTime":77795,"nextInTime":77797,"topicId":77796,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, So Trevor (age 6 in September) goes for his first ever eye exam yesterday.
