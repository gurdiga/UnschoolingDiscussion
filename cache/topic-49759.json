The music school does weekly 30 min. private lessons, and <br/>\nseveral 1 hour  weekly band lessons.  Lots of days to choose from on the <br/>\nbands, and the kids go to the band that is on their level.  They also have <br/>\nconcerts, and a huge 4 day festival held over the Memorial Day weekend, in <br/>\nwhich the kids compete against three other schools.  They also have specialty <br/>\nbands in which the kids have to be either invited, or advanced enough to go <br/>\ninto.  There is also a competition at the festival called show band <br/>\ncompetition, in which each of the four schools puts on a show, any of the <br/>\nkids in the school can audition for the show but only the kids in show band <br/>\ncan play in the band that accompanies the show.  There is a band that teaches <br/>\nthe kids improv, they must learn the different scales and how to negotiate <br/>\nthem, this is jazz.  They also have rock combos where the teachers invite <br/>\nadvanced students to form a rock band and perform.  All of these things keep <br/>\nthe kids interested and eager to improve.  My eldest son plays the <br/>\nsynthesizer, electric guitar, and bass.  He has learned to do the sound board <br/>\nfor performances in and out of the school.  My youngest plays the electric <br/>\nguitar and drums, he is also lead singer in the rock band they formed a year <br/>\nago.  At present, they have cut a demo CD and have played many independent <br/>\ngigs.  They love the music, and plan to become professionals.  They have <br/>\ntheir friends over nearly every weekend to jam.  They are also involved in a <br/>\nbudding jazz band that they formed on their on from their theory class, and <br/>\ntheir teacher was so blown away with them that he wants to work with them to <br/>\ngig out also.  <br/>\nThey have been doing this for five years, there were times when they didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to practice, and there were times they wanted to quit.  We didn&#39;t let <br/>\nthem, we simply looked for other ways to make it more interesting, and in <br/>\nsome cases, let them change instruments.  But they did not loose the love of <br/>\nmusic, and what they wanted to quit was the instrument, not the music. Now <br/>\nthey play them all, and play any type of music from rock to reggae, they have <br/>\nexperience in studio recording, live performing outside the sheltering arms <br/>\nof the family and school, they can do sound board operation, sing and act, <br/>\nTheir social activities center around the school, they are there 5 and soon <br/>\nto be 6 days a week, because I allow them to be in whatever bands or combos <br/>\nthey want.  Sounds like a unit study doesn&#39;t it?  LOL.  <br/>\nI know this is long, but there are things that can be beneficial, even if <br/>\nthey are structured and you have to give them a push every now and then. If <br/>\nthey want the music, they need the leeway to find the instrument, that is the <br/>\nthing, finding the right instrument and watch them take off<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5972,"nextTopicId":49765}}
