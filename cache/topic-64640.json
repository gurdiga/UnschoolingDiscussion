But some principles are the <br/>\nsame.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, we try to live our lives as if no such thing as school <br/>\nexisted. We read, play games, cook, garden, go to museums, go to parks, <br/>\ntravel, craft, explore, experiement, you name it. I&#39;m sure you may have done <br/>\nmost of those things while using a curriculum too. The difference is in *my* <br/>\nunderstanding about how learning works. I don&#39;t do all these fun and <br/>\ninteresting things to &quot;get to&quot; the learning. I know from experience that the <br/>\nlearning will come naturally just by doing all these fun and interesting <br/>\nthings. I sometimes pre-plan activities, but I don&#39;t pre-plan the outcomes. <br/>\nI let the learning lead the way, rather than me trying to lead my kids to <br/>\nthe learning.
