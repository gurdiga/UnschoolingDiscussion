Lots of children who were vaccinated caught chicken pox<br/>\nand we (child care workers) had to enlighten <br/>\nthe parents bc the doctors had not.  the same goes for other<br/>\nvaccinations-people don&#39;t know what they are getting <br/>\nand they are lead to believe it will save them. I strongly disagree with<br/>\nthe fear tactics that are used with immunizing.<br/>\nWe do not vaccinate and try not to medicate  (unless absolutely<br/>\nnecessary). My children are so much healthier than their peers.  I laugh<br/>\nbc our doctor still gives me the antibiotic prescription (just in<br/>\ncase-says the dr.) and we have yet to use it. If we were a high risk<br/>\ngroup maybe I would have to reconsider but for now it works for my<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\nIn the spirit of unschooling,<br/>\nKathy<br/>\nmother to Emily 4 & Ethan 20 months<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, 09 Feb 2001 00:08:53 -0600 &quot;Annette Naake&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naake1999@...\">naake1999@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One reason I immunized my boys was that my father was ill with <br/>\n&gt; leukemia for <br/>\n&gt; years and his immune system was suppressed.
