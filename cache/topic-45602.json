We have had <br/>\nevery imaginable color in this house of it. My Sierra loves to try them all <br/>\nand see which ones she likes better. I drink it and prefer the blue and <br/>\nlight green (not the lime one) and also the fierce purple. Alyssa, my <br/>\ntwo-year old likes it too. Needless to say, anything she drinks or eats <br/>\neventually gets spilled!! I have had it on her skin and clothes. Blue, <br/>\nfierce grape and fierce berry. I&#39;ve never had it stain her skin or clothes <br/>\nto where I couldn&#39;t get it out.
