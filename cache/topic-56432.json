You can&#39;t just let kids chat with ANYONE!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUGH!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey completely missed the point.  No harm was done and we all learned A LOT.  I bet I can say with 100% certainty that my kids will never make that mistake again BECAUSE of this experience...not because of any advice I gave them before.  And NOW they know how to track someone who does this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nUGH again.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56378,"nextTopicId":56434}}
