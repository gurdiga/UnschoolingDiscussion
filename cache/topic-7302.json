(not neccessarily <br/>\nnature drawing, just whatever they feel like drawing.  for my 7yo it is <br/>\negyptian people in ancient dress at the moment!)  i am reading &quot;the charlotte <br/>\nmason companion&quot; (k. andreola) right now and enjoying it.  i dont plan to <br/>\nfollow the method, but enjoy hearing the philosophy, and parts of it i will <br/>\nabsorb i&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\ni attended a raymond and dorothy moore seminar this wk and  couldnt believe <br/>\nhow &quot;unschooly&quot; they are!  many of you will be familiar with them, their <br/>\nnames have been around in homeschooling since the 70&#39;s-- and are both turning <br/>\n85 this year!  they call themselves &quot;the grandparents of homeschooling&quot; (a <br/>\ngenerous term) but in reality have had an influence and have some great <br/>\nrecommendations to share.  the &quot;moore formula&quot; includes a(n equal?) <br/>\ncombination of work, service and study with NO formal schooling til at least <br/>\n10-13years old.  they share lots of research about the proof for delaying <br/>\nformal studies including some interesting info from opthalmogists on the <br/>\ndevelopment of the eye.  they encourage parents to listen to our children, <br/>\nfind their interests and let them be motivated to learn all they want!   i <br/>\ndid not agree with everything i heard (they promote ezzo and babywise for <br/>\nbabies!!  ugh.  ...and dont recommend reading fiction... ????)  but much of <br/>\nwhat i heard was affirming and encouraging.    btw, i would recommend their <br/>\nbook or some tapes over hearing them in person-- they are a bit, well, <br/>\nreflecting their age when they speak!<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7300,"nextTopicId":7303}}
