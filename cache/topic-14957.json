I am<br/>\npretty new to this list and have also been lurking to get the &#39;lay of<br/>\nthe land&#39; so to speak, and I am going to unlurk in order to second Ann&#39;s<br/>\nopinion on the Miele vaccuum.  As a severe allergy sufferer myself (and<br/>\nafter spending at least $1,000.00 on bad vaccuums over the last 10 yrs)<br/>\nI decided to do the research too, and THIS time buy one that would work<br/>\nmore than 6 mos. As the Miele&#39;s ARE rather expensive, I didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nput in my experience with them as a new member, but as a affirmation of<br/>\na seasoned list member, I will!
