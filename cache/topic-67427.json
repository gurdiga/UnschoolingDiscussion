I always HATED when <br/>\nwe went to community egg hunts.  so we started having our own and we set it <br/>\nup so each kid would be a winner. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the kids were little we had one tradition which stuck, no matter what <br/>\nelse.  This is the first year we didn&#39;t do eggs (my leg was hurting and kids <br/>\nwere older and had company coming over).  But last year, even though the <br/>\nyoungest was ten, they reminded me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe put out plastic eggs with coins in them, either exclusively or with other <br/>\nthings.  But SOME eggs had a paper dollar.  Instead of having it be a <br/>\nscramble, of those we made as many as there were kids, and hid them all in <br/>\nthe same place.  Often in a basket or nest-like thing (or one year, an old <br/>\nbird&#39;s nest that had blown down).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone came to where there was more than one egg in one place, they only <br/>\ntook one.  The kid who found that last might not know that was &quot;the prize <br/>\negg&quot; but at that point it didn&#39;t matter, they&#39;d only get one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66494,"nextTopicId":67396}}
