Her dad ( whom doesn&#39;t live with us) speaks no English. I made the decision to Unschool specifically because I resented( and still do) the notion that success in this country can only come in a certain language, following a specific pov historically etc.  I mean even the term success is subjective. Can homeschooling work in a non English dominant, immigrant family? I would think so...even more so unschooling. What could be a problem is resources ( money, time, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nM. la Mala<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I speak German, so it made it easier. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe &quot;blended&quot; as well as we could. Cameron was only an infant---but was <br/>\nwalking and talking before we left. He fit RIGHT in with the neighbors. He <br/>\nunderstood certain customs and certainly their language. I think that if the <br/>\nparents isolate the children, they may take longer to blend in---but if the <br/>\nchildren hang out with American kids, visit in their homes, talk with them on <br/>\nthe phone, go to birthday parties, etc.,  they should be just as &quot;American&quot; <br/>\nas native kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to school would basically let them know what &quot;school&quot; culture is ONLY. <br/>\nAnd even Duncan will never know THAT! &lt;g&gt; On the plus side, this family&#39;s <br/>\nchildren could be bi-lingual.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"An interesting debate","postDate":"1050251647","msgId":64646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFOTk5MTdFLkE4RURGNTlEQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFlOC42ODVkZmY5LjJiY2ExZGQxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64710,"prevInTime":64645,"nextInTime":64647,"topicId":64646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been talking with a lady who s parents are Chinese and emigrated to Canada just before they had 6 kids.
