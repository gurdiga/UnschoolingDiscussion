Sometimes I<br/>\nwould read the posts aghast, and think &quot;There is no WAY I could do that --<br/>\nthat is so irresponsible!&quot; or &quot;Shouldn&#39;t kids just have to obey without all<br/>\nthis pussyfooting around?&quot;  (Okay, I am terribly embarrassed to admit it<br/>\nnow, but I was also in the process of deschooling myself!  Still am, in lots<br/>\nof ways.)  Anyhow, yesterday I had to drop the older two off at the &quot;Y&quot; for<br/>\ntheir gym and swim session.  I usually run errands for the first hour while<br/>\nthey do whatever the sport of the week is, and join them in the pool for the<br/>\nlast half.  The 2 year old was most anxious to go swimming, and needed<br/>\nconstant reassurance that she would get to go.  She fell asleep in the van<br/>\non the way to the pool, which left me with a real dilemma.  Should I wake<br/>\nher from her nap and contend with a grumpy toddler, or let her sleep and<br/>\nbreak my promise?  I mean, how important was a promise to a two year old,<br/>\nanyway? She wouldn&#39;t even remember when she was older.  And she&#39;d be much<br/>\nbetter off with the extra sleep.  Now, I know for most of you there wouldn&#39;t<br/>\neven have been a question here.  Unschooling is just second nature.  Ashamed<br/>\nas I am to admit it, I actually had to reason it out.  I finally took a deep<br/>\nbreath and woke her.  Sure enough, she woke up howling and demanding her<br/>\nhat.  I was completely mystified, as she has no hat.  She grudgingly put on<br/>\nher suit, and then sobbed for a good quarter of an hour in the pool while I<br/>\nheld her and rocked her and asked if she wanted to go home, or play, or<br/>\nnurse, or what.  She just kept asking for her hat.  Feeling very frustrated<br/>\n(but  remembering to try to not say &quot;no&quot;), I finally asked her what her hat<br/>\nlooked like.  She described it, and I promised that as soon as we got home,<br/>\nwe would find a hat just like that. (And we did!) She finally calmed down,<br/>\nleaned her head against me, and said, &quot;I love you mama; in the whole world.&quot;<br/>\nThen she splashed happily about.  Could she have used the extra sleep? Given<br/>\nher response to being waken, most assuredly.  WIll she remember I kept my<br/>\npromise?  Possibly not -- but hopefully I am establishing a pattern here.<br/>\nWas it wretched having her howl and yowl and advertise to the &quot;Y&quot; at large<br/>\nthat I am the World&#39;s Worst Mother?  Oh, don&#39;t even go there.  The<br/>\ntemptation to say, &quot;What&#39;s your mama&#39;s name, little girl?  Shall I help you<br/>\nfind her?&quot;  and be elevated to Heroic Rescuer instead of WWM was almost<br/>\noverwhelming.  But it&#39;s like those mastercard commercials:  they add up all<br/>\nthe costs of whatever, but then deem the experience &quot;priceless&quot;. SO although<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t second nature, I think I am finally starting to internalize what<br/>\nyou lot know already.  Thanks for the help along the journey.
