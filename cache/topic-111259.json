Noah (dh) cruised the internet learning about <br/>\njewel faceting.  I went to Curves with my Mom, and on the way home <br/>\ndefended unschooling, just a bit, between deep breaths.  My Dad <br/>\nthrew up a lot, having caught the virus Lucy and I had.  Lucy took a <br/>\nnap with Noah and Cricket and I played with her Barbie and did some <br/>\nneedlework crafting.  I am just venturing into felt embroidery.  I <br/>\nlove the look of it, but sequins and tiny beads and 2 & 4 yos makes <br/>\nme sweat a little.  But Cricket&#39;s great and loves all the crafty <br/>\nthings.  Lucy woke, I made chocolate chip cookies that rock, and <br/>\nCricket put on a show for us (minus Dad) about Action Girl <br/>\n(sometimes her, sometimes Barbie).  Now Noah&#39;s reading a new bio on <br/>\nShakespeare, Mom and Dad are resting, the girls are playing (though <br/>\nLucy&#39;s heading this way), and I am getting caught up with you guys.  <br/>\nI love those Dropshots!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza Rose in NC for a bit longer...<br/>\n<br/>\nps - we&#39;re visiting Greensboro until Feb. 1... any one out there <br/>\nwant to visit?  mail me offlist... !!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55279,"nextTopicId":111125}}
