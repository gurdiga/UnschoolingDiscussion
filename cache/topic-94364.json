Please feel free to<br/>\nask any other questions you might have here or privately and we can see if<br/>\nwe can help you. :) Jane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion #1 - How would you &quot;define&quot; unschooling?<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if there is a way to define unschooling, I just do my things<br/>\nand go day to day doing what I want to do. I find it&#39;s the best &quot;life style&quot;<br/>\nfor me. There aren&#39;t many rules to follow and barely any structure. In<br/>\npublic school I never felt like I ever got enough time to read into subjects<br/>\nI was being force fed, but with unschooling, instead of just going from<br/>\nsubject to subject I&#39;ll go in phases where I&#39;ll take any knowledge I can<br/>\nget. For a while I was a beatnik, reading only Kerouac, Burroughs, Kesey and<br/>\nGinsberg and then I&#39;ll be interested in urban legends and social sciences. I<br/>\nnever set out to be an unschooler, I guess I just am.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion #2 - What is your favorite thing about homeschooling?<br/>\nEverything, way too many list off, so here is a few:<br/>\n#1. I like not being confined in the walls of a school all day long.<br/>\n#2. I like the ability to learn at my own pace when and where I want<br/>\n#3. I like to be able to have a Job(Puppeteering,Working with Loran (his<br/>\ndad), T-shirts)<br/>\n#4. I like being able to go where ever I want at my leisure, not having to<br/>\nask for a hall pass or excuse slip.<br/>\n#5. I like the more realistic social settings than the social settings in<br/>\nschool where you are kept with people your own age, except your teacher, and<br/>\nable to have friendships with everyone from 8 to 80 instead of your<br/>\ndesignated age range.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion #3 - What is a typical day like for you? (what are you &quot;into&quot;?)<br/>\nI wake up at my leisure, take a shower, eat breakfast, Some days I go to the<br/>\nthrift store down the street and buy some records or something and then come<br/>\nhome work around the house, work on the computer, go somewhere, read<br/>\nwhenever, ride a bike around, talk to people, take some photos. When I was<br/>\ndoing &quot;The Mikado&quot;  puppet show at the folly theater, I lived with some<br/>\nfriends, the Usher&#39;s,  in Kansas city and rode my bike to work everyday,<br/>\nwhich was 5 blocks away from the Folly. I got to do alot of sight seeing in<br/>\ndowntown Kansas city and I always had a camera, when I had rehearsals I<br/>\nworked over on Linwood and Troost and would ride over there and in the<br/>\nafternoon ride back to the Ushers or I&#39;d go to Westport or the Plaza or to<br/>\nmy girlfriend Ida&#39;s. That was a much further ride like many miles. I feel<br/>\nlike that was a good &quot;unschooling&quot; experience and know that If I were in<br/>\nschool I&#39;d never have those experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;earthwaterairfire&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthwaterairfire@...\">earthwaterairfire@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 20, 2004 7:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] I&#39;m not doing well in high school<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if I should quit or stay: I feel like quitting but my<br/>\n&gt; parents say it&#39;s free knowledge<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve researched about unschooling and am interested in what other<br/>\n&gt; teens have to say about unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
