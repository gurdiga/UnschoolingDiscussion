We&#39;ll<br/>\nalso be travelling the Natchez Trace from southern Mississippi to southern<br/>\nTennessee and taking a look at some non-Civil War sites there, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion first:  Have you been to any CW sites that were particularly<br/>\nriveting that we just shouldn&#39;t miss?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: We&#39;ve only got two weeks altogether, and will be driving from<br/>\nHouston to DC and back, so time is of the essence.  What would you<br/>\nparticularly recommend in the DC area?  We just can&#39;t do the whole thing,<br/>\nand this is not the trip for it.  I was thinking of Ford&#39;s Theater...are<br/>\nthere any other particular CW sites that we should visit there?  (I<br/>\nknow....I&#39;m checking online too. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird: Any great places to eat or stay?  We&#39;re looking at a tight budget,<br/>\nbut can splurge once in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth:  Good scenic routes?  In particular, can anyone tell me if<br/>\nInterstate 81 through western Virginia is good?  I&#39;d love to be able to get<br/>\noff the interstates altogether and take back roads, but we just won&#39;t have<br/>\nthe time.  The map looks like 81 goes right through the long middle of the<br/>\nW. Virginia mountains on the west and the Blue Ridge on the East.  Is it<br/>\nnice there, or have they managed to make that interstate as boring as so<br/>\nmany others?  We will, however, be able to take back roads for select<br/>\nperiods.  Any favorites?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your time in responding!<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura,<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Staunton VA, right at the intersection of I-81 and I-64 East.  We<br/>\nalso love going to the Civil War sites and have been to lots of them.  I can<br/>\nsuggest places to stop and routes you might take to see as much as possible<br/>\nin this area of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been to Vicksburg, MS and Chattanooga/Chickamuagua parks and enjoyed<br/>\nthem both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll put it in the closest to chronological order that makes sense<br/>\ntravelling a circuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d go up I-81 into VA (you&#39;ll be travelling through the Great Smoky Mts. in<br/>\nTN) and  stop at Lexington.  There you&#39;ll find Stonewall Jackson&#39;s House<br/>\n(I&#39;d skip it with time constraints) and the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery,<br/>\nwhere he is buried.  Right down the road is Washington & Lee University,<br/>\nwith Lee Chapel on the grounds, where Robert E. Lee is buried.  At the VMI<br/>\nMuseum you could see Jackson&#39;s horse (I forget his name) and other Civil war<br/>\nmemoribilia.  This is a very small town and worth getting off the interstate<br/>\nto drive through.  Everything is right on/by the main street (Hwy 11)<br/>\nthrough town.<br/>\n<br/>\nContinue north on 81 to New Market Battlefield.  The VMI cadets marched from<br/>\nLexington to there and fought in that battle - very moving story.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nnever spent the time or $ to go to the private museum that&#39;s next door, so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say if it&#39;s any good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWest on I-66 to Manassas (Bull Run) where the first land battle took place.<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing that people from DC came out in their carriages for a picnic to<br/>\nsee the show!  Also, it&#39;s the place where &quot;Stonewall&quot; got his nickname.<br/>\n<br/>\nInto DC - Ford&#39;s Theater is great, but be sure and check times and rehearsal<br/>\nschedules!  We took my MIL there and couldn&#39;t get in because of a rehearsal.<br/>\nAcross the stree is the &quot;House where Lincoln died&quot; - They give a lot of info<br/>\nin a little time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorth you want to see Antietam (MD) and Gettysburg, for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you come back down I-95 to Fredericksburg (nice site, interesting because<br/>\nof them crossing the river), go slightly west and also see Chancelorsville<br/>\n(where Jackson was shot) and The Wilderness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have time and want to, continue south on 95 to see Richmond (capital<br/>\nof the Confederacy) and Petersburg (supposed to be good - I haven&#39;t been to<br/>\nthat one).<br/>\n<br/>\nGo west, either from Chancelorsville, Richmond, or Petersburg (all smaller<br/>\nroads through the Piedmont - rolling hills - scenic) to Appomatox<br/>\nCourthouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWest through Lynchburg to I-81 and south.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s plenty more to see here, and the country along I-81 is beautiful, I<br/>\nthink.  As you travel north, first you&#39;re in Mts., but then in the Great<br/>\nValley of VA, with the Alleghenies on the west and the Blue Ridge on the<br/>\neast.  You could take a little time to go up on the Blue Ridge Parkway if<br/>\nyou like mt. views, but you&#39;ll get plenty of those along the trip anyway.<br/>\nAlso, you could get off the Interstate some and travel Hwy 11(the<br/>\nLee-Jackson Hwy).  It was the main route even back in the 1800s. You&#39;ll see<br/>\nlittle towns (like villages), some interesting eating places,<br/>\nbed&breakfasts, and lots of antiques shops.  But I&#39;d mostly stay on 81 to<br/>\nget to places faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things to see - in Staunton, where I live, there is the Blackfriar&#39;s<br/>\nPlayhouse, the only re-creation in the world of Shakespeare&#39;s indoor<br/>\ntheater.  Beautiful place, great plays!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, The American Frontier Culture Museum, with working farms, English,<br/>\nGerman, Scotch-Irish, American blend, but from an earlier era than the Civil<br/>\nWar.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong the entire valley there are caverns (as in TX).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn DC the new American Indian Museum will be open at the Smithsonian.<br/>\nSounds fantastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I hope this helps and was not too boring for anyone else reading it!<br/>\nI&#39;m from Arlington, VA and lived in TX for years, so have made many trips<br/>\nback and forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you don&#39;t have this, I&#39;d recommend getting the Passport book at the<br/>\nNational park service.  You can save money just getting the cancellations in<br/>\nanother book or notebook, but my kids really treasure their special<br/>\npassports).   Get cancellations at all of the National sites, but also ask<br/>\nat non-national park sites if they have a stamp (like the Alamo does).  It&#39;s<br/>\na wonderful keepsake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, sorry this was so long.  Have a wonderful trip!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98872,"nextTopicId":98874}}
