I&#39;ve been intrested in the idea of<br/>\nunschooling for a couple of years now, my friend introducing it to me<br/>\nat first, not trying to push anything onto me, just giving me some<br/>\nresources to check out and consider. I soon plan to buy The Teenage<br/>\nLiberation Handbook after reading a three-chapter excerpt online. But,<br/>\ncurrently, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do of my situation.<br/>\n���But, the county only permits 10 excused absences,<br/>\nof which I have 14, if Im absent again I will fail my classes, repeat<br/>\nthe grade, and my parents may be brought to court for, as the notice<br/>\nsaid, &quot;not seeing that I am kept in school&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi James,<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting by reading and research is a good idea. However it is difficult to<br/>\nsee how you could become a homeschooler without getting your parents on<br/>\nboard and supportive. I strongly suggest that you collect all your<br/>\ninformation and be able to present it to them, as has been suggested,<br/>\nespecially beginning with the legalities of homeschooling in Florida. There<br/>\nis all the legal information at the NHEN website. Your parents need to feel<br/>\nsecure that they will not be prosecuted if the State�s regulations are<br/>\nfollowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, you will notice I am saying homeschooler rather than unschooler. I<br/>\nsuspect that parents suddenly presented with the notion of unschooling for<br/>\nthe first time, may balk and initially have the belief that you are just<br/>\ngoofing off. I am perhaps assuming too much � maybe they already know about<br/>\nthe concept. Nonetheless, many people come to unschooling gradually. I<br/>\nsuggest that you present to your parents a �study program� that includes all<br/>\nthe things you are into, especially the computer stuff, with some idea of<br/>\nwhere these things might take you. As they become more relaxed, and see you<br/>\ntaking responsibility for your own learning, and as they learn more about<br/>\nunschooling, the structure you begin with will fade to become what you can<br/>\ntruly enjoy. Also I suggest that you bone up on homeschoolers who have made<br/>\ngood without a traditional education, and the number of folks who have good<br/>\ncollege degrees who were homeschooled. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs well as the book Pam suggested, you might find it helpful to get �The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child� � the author�s daughter continues to enjoy great academic<br/>\nsuccess at college. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that the important thing will be to reassure your parents that you<br/>\nwill not grow up to be a deadbeat, at least not because you changed your<br/>\neducational situation. There are many resources available at HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;http://www.unschooling.com/&quot;www.unschooling.com<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck on the message boards. Someone very recently was posting about a teen<br/>\ne-list also, so check the archives of this list. There is a wonderful<br/>\narticle about a teen rising out of school in a recent Life Learning<br/>\nmagazine. Make sure you include information about �deschooling� for you and<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the event that you can�t convince your parents to join you on this<br/>\njourney immediately, there are some articles around about families who are<br/>\nunschoolers at heart, but have some of their children in public school,<br/>\nusually from the child�s choice. I realize that this is not your situation.<br/>\nHowever, the focus is on how to gain from the system without becoming<br/>\ninvested in it or damaged by it � a kind of skeptical detachment � they may<br/>\nhelp you anyway. I believe at least one is at HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;http://www.sandradodd.com/&quot;www.sandradodd.com <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also investigate local homeschooling support groups, especially<br/>\nany teen groups, and possibly sports organizations for homeschooler, if you<br/>\nare interested, and look for some mentors in your special interest areas who<br/>\nare not part of the school system. (This is a good idea even if you stay in<br/>\nschool for now) The very volume of information will be reassuring to your<br/>\nparents, and help demonstrate your commitment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI alluded to the idea of you taking responsibility for your learning � and<br/>\nthat is really very key. If you have frustrations or difficulties they will<br/>\nbe all your responsibility to work through � you won�t be able to blame the<br/>\nbus, the principal, or any notion of having to live up to your brother�s<br/>\nglory, for any problems. It is important to tell your parents not only that<br/>\nyou are seriously unhappy at school, but to show them that you have serious<br/>\ninterests and a genuine desire to keep learning and pursuing your dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I mean that intuitively you know. Your heart knows. <br/>\nYou feel it in your gut. And you are starting to work it out <br/>\nintellectually too.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually making it happen is, I know, a different thing, because you <br/>\ndon&#39;t just have to worry about yourself but about what your parents <br/>\nwill think. Because you&#39;re a minor, the law says that your parents <br/>\nhave a say in what you do. So, worst case scenario, they freak out <br/>\nand force you to stay in school. You can in that case either <br/>\npractice a form of civil disobediance and refuse to go anyway, <br/>\nthough I imagine there would be some stress associated with that <br/>\nchoice. Or you could just make up your mind to &quot;serve your time&quot; <br/>\nuntil you can legally drop out of school. Stress there too, only you <br/>\nknow which is an easier choice to live with.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you are clearly an intelligent, thoughtful person, and therefore <br/>\nhave the tools to be able to present your case well. Your parents <br/>\nmay be stuck in the mindset that says that success at school means <br/>\nsuccess in life. However, they won&#39;t be able to help but be <br/>\nimpressed by the initiative you are taking in doing this research. <br/>\nUnless they completely refuse to listen to you in the first place, I <br/>\nthink you&#39;ve got a very good chance of convincing them to allow you <br/>\nto start directing your own education. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend you read John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, and Grace <br/>\nLlewellyn. (Just to start. :)) Gather together a packet for them, <br/>\nhighlighting parts that especially speak to you. You might even <br/>\nwrite something up  an essay explaining the benefits of this form <br/>\nof education. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I say I feel that everything about school is wrong, yet I still feel<br/>\nguilt and annoyance when I do poorly on tests and the like, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do any of the subjects with which I am charged.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would probably be helpful for you to look for the true <br/>\nsource of this guilt and annoyance. I bet anything it&#39;s not because <br/>\nyou are not learning what is not valuable to you. It probably has <br/>\nsomething to do with what others are thinking about you (even if you <br/>\nknow that their opinions are misguided) and being confronted with <br/>\ntheir negative reactions somewhere down the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bright side, you are thinking about this *now*. Which means <br/>\nthat you are getting an earlier start than most people do in <br/>\novercoming the feeling of obligation to meet others&#39; unreasonable <br/>\nexpectations. (Some people never manage to, a tragedy.) <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of my main intrests is building computers, and I want to dabble <br/>\na bit in programming, which I know is readily learnable on one&#39;s <br/>\nown. But, my school does not offer anything of the like, and Im <br/>\nswamped with enough work to sink a ship already, leaving little free <br/>\ntime, having to read 6 to 8 books every 9 weeks, 90% of which are <br/>\nthings that intrest me in the very least.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this will be a strong point in your argument. Success depends on <br/>\nlearning, and you will learn well only that which you are interested <br/>\nin and care about. It is absurd and illogical to instead devote your <br/>\nenergy to laboring over things that you are not interested in and do <br/>\nnot care about. As you have already figured out, that is not <br/>\naccomplishing anything positive.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My administrator has already talked to me, telling me various <br/>\nthings about I have to stay in school for a future, how I&#39;ve &quot;given <br/>\nhim my word&quot; that I&#39;ll try to do good, and even had me tell it to my <br/>\nparents over the phone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to think about it from his perspective. He has no idea what is <br/>\ngoing on in your head, so to him maybe it looks like you are just <br/>\naimless, lazy, short-sighted, whatever. He sees the potential in <br/>\nyou, though, and this makes him think, geez, I have to do something <br/>\nhere to make sure this kid doesn&#39;t do anything to jeopardize <br/>\nhimself. But here is the thing. He is mistaken. And if he knew he <br/>\nwas mistaken, he wouldn&#39;t expect you to keep your word, he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\neven have asked you for it in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, you shouldn&#39;t feel obligated to keep your word in this <br/>\nsituation. First, because it is based on a basic lack of knowledge <br/>\n(that of the admin and your parents.) Second, it was made through <br/>\ncoercion (expressing concern and disappointment in someone is always <br/>\na good technique to manipulate them into doing what you want them to <br/>\ndo!) Third, keeping your word will harm you, and breaking it will <br/>\nnot harm anyone else.

Maybe you could talk to one of <br/>\ntheir counsellors/advisors about what alternative programs he knows of in that <br/>\nschool or in the community otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could get a job with a computer place near you, doing repairs or <br/>\ninstallations, and that might help you and your parents feel better too.

I&#39;ve been intrested in the idea of<br/>\nunschooling for a couple of years now, my friend introducing it to me<br/>\nat first, not trying to push anything onto me, just giving me some<br/>\nresources to check out and consider. I soon plan to buy The Teenage<br/>\nLiberation Handbook after reading a three-chapter excerpt online. But,<br/>\ncurrently, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do of my situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother, currently a junior in Boston University, attended the same<br/>\nhigh school Im in now, passing with very high grades and getting to<br/>\nknow the teachers well, graduating second highest in his class (forgot<br/>\nthe exact term for it). And every teacher instantly recognizes my last<br/>\nname, especially since Im in most of the honors classes he was in at<br/>\nmy age (along with one AP), and it seems like that I must do well<br/>\nbecause I am his brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel that everything about the way public schools are set up is<br/>\nutterly incorrect and shouldn&#39;t be, yet I can&#39;t do anything about it,<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m &quot;a stupid teenager&quot;. I admit I have been trying to avoid<br/>\nschool as much as I can, which is somewhat easy for me as long as<br/>\nguilt doesn&#39;t take over my mind. My father works from 5:00am until<br/>\n6:00pm and my family only has one car, I live about a half an hour<br/>\ndrive from my school, so if I am to miss the bus, I have no way of<br/>\ngetting to school. But, the county only permits 10 excused absences,<br/>\nof which I have 14, if Im absent again I will fail my classes, repeat<br/>\nthe grade, and my parents may be brought to court for, as the notice<br/>\nsaid, &quot;not seeing that I am kept in school&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say I feel that everything about school is wrong, yet I still feel<br/>\nguilt and annoyance when I do poorly on tests and the like, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do any of the subjects with which I am charged. One of<br/>\nmy main intrests is building computers, and I want to dabble a bit in<br/>\nprogramming, which I know is readily learnable on one&#39;s own. But, my<br/>\nschool does not offer anything of the like, and Im swamped with enough<br/>\nwork to sink a ship already, leaving little free time, having to read<br/>\n6 to 8 books every 9 weeks, 90% of which are things that intrest me in<br/>\nthe very least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can legally drop-out at the age of 16, which I will be Januray 19th<br/>\nof 2005, my Sophmore year, but I don&#39;t know how much longer I can put<br/>\nup with this life.
