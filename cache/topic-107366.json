We generally<br/>\nget along very well, and she for the most part keeps her mouth shut<br/>\nwhen I do things she disagrees with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is, however, *very* concerned about my kids and unschooling. <br/>\nMostly that my just turned 8 year old isn&#39;t reading yet.  She just<br/>\nexpressed her concern to me again just last week, when she went to the<br/>\nHarry Potter event at Barnes & Nobles with me and my kids.  She saw<br/>\nthat my son was very excited to get the book so that I could read it<br/>\nto him, but she saw that as a negative, not a positive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer argument was this:  I did school at home with my now 12 year old<br/>\ndaughter, and taught her how to read when she was 4, and she<br/>\nabsolutely loves reading now.  When she was 8, she read all the time.<br/>\n &quot;But look at Matt, he&#39;s not reading at all, and he&#39;s eight&quot;, she<br/>\nsaid. She said &quot;he&#39;s eight&quot; in a dramatic whisper, as if it was a<br/>\nhorrible, horrible tragedy that she couldn&#39;t bear to voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained the unschooling philosophy to her several times.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nemailed her links to a few of Sandra&#39;s articles.  Once I took the time<br/>\nto give a lengthy explanation to a non-unschooling online friend about<br/>\nunschooling and reading, and I copied and pasted it and sent it to her<br/>\nwith a friendly, &quot;Hey Mom, someone asked me about unschooling and<br/>\nreading and I know you&#39;ve expressed concern about that aspect of<br/>\nunschooling, so I thought you might enjoy the response I gave this<br/>\nperson&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this time I started to give her the &quot;he&#39;ll learn when he&#39;s ready&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;look at all the cool things he IS doing&quot; etc, she interrupted me<br/>\nand said, &quot;Yes, I know all that, I&#39;ve heard all those lines before,<br/>\nand I know you do all kinds of good, interesting things that<br/>\ncontribute to their education.  But they NEED phonics and things like<br/>\nbasic math&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I could do at that point was stand my ground and disagree.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA few days later she stopped by to see Matt&#39;s hotwheels set that he<br/>\nput together.  She had gotten it for him for his birthday.  While she<br/>\nwas there, I printed out some pages from the journal that I keep of<br/>\nthings my kids learn.  I picked some pages that showed some really<br/>\ncool things about numbers and letters that they learned naturally, on<br/>\ntheir own, while doing fun, interesting, non-schooly things.  I<br/>\nthought for SURE she would be impressed at what they&#39;re learning and<br/>\nunderstand.  I asked her today what she thought, and she acted like<br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t impressed.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law is equally concerned, mostly about the reading issue.<br/>\n People aren&#39;t as concerned about Alisha, because she can read.  But<br/>\nthe late reading is a huge hurdle for some people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be easier if they were complete jerks who were rude to our<br/>\nkids and don&#39;t care much about them.  But when you know that they<br/>\ngenuinely love their grandkids and are truly concerned, it&#39;s nice to<br/>\nat least try to make them understand. I know that if my children<br/>\nwanted to send my kids to public school and punish them if they didn&#39;t<br/>\nmake the honor roll, I wouldn&#39;t want them sticking their nose in the<br/>\nair at me instead of talking it through with me. ;)  And I know my mom<br/>\ndoes understand and accept more about unschooling than she used to. <br/>\nWhether or not she ever will completely get it or not remains to be<br/>\nseen.  There comes a point when you just have to accept that they<br/>\nmight never get it, and stand your ground.  If they&#39;re nice about it,<br/>\ngreat.
