She did not <br/>\nhave alot of friends in school, not really good ones, anyway. When she quit <br/>\ngoing to school they all pretty much dropped her and she was not interested <br/>\nin meeting any hs kids her age for quite awhile. That did eventually change, <br/>\nand she still has her best friend-a girl 6 years older, who she has known <br/>\nall her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it&#39;s possible that meeting others on the internet could really<br/>\n&gt;help.

She also played a MUD with the kids from Holland <br/>\nwhich made her alot of friends. She spent hours on the computer-sometimes <br/>\nstaying up all night. I know that the list they were on was called Home <br/>\nLearning Teens-they may not be on it anymore, I think they got a bit tired <br/>\nof it eventually. I&#39;m sure you can find a group for her-I think someone here <br/>\nmentioned starting one.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t get home til Saturday, but next week I will have her write to <br/>\nKatrina-you can send me her new email addy privately if you like. I have had <br/>\nher connect with other kids I found on the net. I found Adam, the boy who is <br/>\nhosting the camp out, on a message board and he has become a wonderful <br/>\nfriend of out whole family. I eventually met his parents and he spent a week <br/>\nwith us last month.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there, let her heal, think about what is really important for her to <br/>\nlearn instead of what she would be doing in school, and have some fun <br/>\ntogether.
