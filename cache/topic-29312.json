For some reason I never knew (or remembered??!!) that bit of info.<br/>\nI know you have a range ... :-)<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lynda <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 03, 2001 6:11 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:reading late<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Eldest son was that way.  Like a long dry spell without reading anything<br/>\n  that didn&#39;t, I guess you could say, give him something &quot;useful&quot; in return<br/>\n  for his reading.

Her loss, yes, but she&#39;ll still be able to get along as an<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;adult with these skills and that&#39;s all I care about with regard to<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;reading. Seems your son is the same...<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I think so.  The thing I just don&#39;t *get* though, is how he could go from<br/>\n  &gt; absolutely loving to have fiction read to him, to not wanting to read it<br/>\n  &gt; and rarely wanting it read to him.  I can understand not wanting to be<br/>\n  read<br/>\n  &gt; to at age 14, though I still enjoyed it sometimes at that age as a family<br/>\n  &gt; reading time.  But to not want to try to read the fiction he&#39;s always<br/>\n  &gt; loved.....?  I guess it&#39;s still too hard for him to read fast enough to<br/>\n  &gt; enjoy it.  When he&#39;s reading non-fiction, he&#39;s reading for specific info<br/>\n  &gt; that he wants.<br/>\n  &gt; Tia<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Tia Leschke   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\n  &gt; On Vancouver Island<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  ****************************************************************************<br/>\n  ****************<br/>\n  &gt; It is the answers which separate us, the questions which unite us. -<br/>\n  Janice<br/>\n  &gt; Levy<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
