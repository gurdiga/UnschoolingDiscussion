I have a <br/>\nrelative who went to some parenting classes put on by a PhD in Early <br/>\nChildhood Education. It was stressed that it is important for kids to <br/>\nhave an early bedtime so that parents get their alone time. The person <br/>\ntalked about how one of the biggest mistakes young parents make is that <br/>\nthey want more time with their kids (after work and daycare all day) so <br/>\nthey keep them up too late and lose out on couple time. Blah blah blah. <br/>\nSo my relative has this kid who is a little unusual in that he really <br/>\nhas always needed fairly little sleep - at four he really sleeps only <br/>\nabout 8 hours and that&#39;s enough for him. He&#39;s never been much of a <br/>\nsleeper - not a napper, etc. So - they put the kid to bed at 7:30 or 8 <br/>\n- because that&#39;s his bedtime and it is ruining their family life <br/>\nbecause the kid is up and wakes them up at 4 in the morning. They have <br/>\nno sense of thinking logically about this problem - all they do is try <br/>\nto figure out how to apply the expert&#39;s advice - it doesn&#39;t occur to <br/>\nthem that the expert doesn&#39;t know THEIR kid and their family and that <br/>\nthey can work out their own solution.
