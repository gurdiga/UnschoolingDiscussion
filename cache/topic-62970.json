Is there a wonderful moment when<br/>\n                    parents can become detached spectators in<br/>\n                  the lives of their children and shrug, &quot;It&#39;s<br/>\n                         their life,&quot; and feel nothing?<br/>\n  <br/>\n                When I was in my twenties, I stood in a hospital<br/>\n                    corridor waiting for doctors to put a few<br/>\n                  stitches in my son&#39;s head. I asked, &quot;When do<br/>\n                       you stop worrying?&quot; The nurse said,<br/>\n                  &quot;When they get out of the accident stage.&quot; My<br/>\n                  mother just smiled faintly and said nothing.<br/>\n  <br/>\n                  When I was in my thirties, I sat on a little<br/>\n                  chair in a class-room and heard how one of my<br/>\n                children talked incessantly, disrupted the class,<br/>\n                       and was headed for a career making<br/>\n                license plates. As if to read my mind, a teacher<br/>\n                     said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they all go through<br/>\n                 this stage and then you can sit back, relax and<br/>\n                       enjoy them.&quot; My mother just smiled<br/>\n                            faintly and said nothing.<br/>\n  <br/>\n                  When I was in my forties, I spent a lifetime<br/>\n                 waiting for the phone to ring, the cars to come<br/>\n                  home, the front door to open. A friend said,<br/>\n                    &quot;They&#39;re trying to find themselves. Don&#39;t<br/>\n                  worry, in a few years, you can stop worrying.<br/>\n                    They&#39;ll be adults.&quot; My mother just smiled<br/>\n                            faintly and said nothing.<br/>\n  <br/>\n                By the time I was 50, I was sick & tired of being<br/>\n                    vulnerable. I was still worrying over my<br/>\n                  children, but there was a new wrinkle, there<br/>\n                       was nothing I could do about it. My<br/>\n                 mother just smiled faintly and said nothing. I<br/>\n                  continued to anguish over their failures, be<br/>\n                 tormented by their frustrations and absorbed in<br/>\n                             their disappointments.<br/>\n  <br/>\n                 My friends said that when my kids got married I<br/>\n                       could stop worrying and lead my own<br/>\n                    life. I wanted to believe that, but I was<br/>\n                    haunted by my mother&#39;s warm smile and her<br/>\n                 occasional, &quot;You look pale. Are you all right?<br/>\n                      Call me the minute you get home. Are<br/>\n                         you depressed about something?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n                    Can it be that parents are sentenced to a<br/>\n                  lifetime of worry? Is concern for one another<br/>\n                 handed down like a torch to blaze the trail of<br/>\n                      human frailties and the fears of the<br/>\n                  unknown? Is concern a curse or is it a virtue<br/>\n                  that elevates us to the highest form of life?<br/>\n  <br/>\n                    One of my children became quite irritable<br/>\n                  recently, saying to me, &quot;Where were you? I&#39;ve<br/>\n                  been calling for 3 days, and no one answered.<br/>\n                     I was worried.&quot; I smiled a warm smile.<br/>\n                           The torch has been passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62923,"nextTopicId":62973}}
