I live in New Zealand and the<br/>\ninformation here does take a bit of digging to locate but some of the<br/>\ngreatest books I have read apart from John Holt and John Taylor Gatto (of<br/>\ncourse!!!) have been &quot;Taking The Joy Out Of Egypt&quot; and &quot;And The Skylark<br/>\nsings With Me&quot; I do have to add the proviso however that after reading both<br/>\nbooks I did look at my kids a bit slit-eyed wondering why none of them<br/>\nshowed any desire to study architecture or make their own telescopes!! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI have realised of course that all kids are gifted and special in their own<br/>\nways and my kids will discover their particular passions when they are ready<br/>\n(but still, I am only human and seriously considered &quot;casually&quot; leaving<br/>\nbooks on physics scattered about!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter than books though (which do sometimes seem to be a bit daunting!!<br/>\nespecially if your kid would rather make planes out of books than study<br/>\nthem!!) are these message boards!
