They, also add pressure on the bottom the spine.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to add a note here.  My oldest was born with a dislocated hip<br/>\nand had to wear a brace for six months, and was seen by a pediatric<br/>\northopedic specialist for the first year of his life.  Because of the brace<br/>\nconventional carriers did not work, and he *had* to be carried in order to<br/>\nbe happy.  I saw a sling carrier in a magazine and bought it hoping it would<br/>\nwork.  It did, and I loved it.  I can&#39;t remember the brand, it was one of<br/>\nthe first ones, with metal rings.  I used it for my three kids, a friend<br/>\nused it for her two in between my three, and I passed it on after I was done<br/>\nwith it.  Very durable!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe orthopedist told me that the sling was very good for babies, as it held<br/>\nthem in a natural position.  He also said that the umbrella strollers were<br/>\nunhealthy for young babies since it forced them to sit up and put too much<br/>\npressure on the spine.  Strollers that allow babies to recline are best for<br/>\nbabies.  Remember that bones are actually cartilage when babies are born,<br/>\nand even at one year old there is still a significant amount of cartilage.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9412,"nextTopicId":9435}}
