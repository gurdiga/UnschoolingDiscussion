My dad is a person who has <br/>\na natural gift for understanding and explaining history and philosophy.  He <br/>\nnever went to college and is retired from the Post Office.  My sister has a <br/>\nB.A. in History and she says he knows a lot more history than she does.  <br/>\nHowever, he has always felt inadequate because he is not at ALL mechanical or <br/>\nconstruction oriented.  Maybe if he had the degree and had worked in those <br/>\nfields it would be different (?) but at any rate, it really bothers him.  <br/>\n    I think what it comes down to is that all types of learners should be <br/>\nvalued and that we should all find ways to do the things which seem to be the <br/>\nright match for us at any given time.  My dad now works part time as a noon <br/>\nduty aide at a middle school to supplement his retirement and although I&#39;m <br/>\nnot a public school fan, I have to say that he is making a great contribution <br/>\nbecause he treats those kids with such a kind, reasonable attitude.  They <br/>\nreally like him.  He feels embarrassed at times about his job because it&#39;s <br/>\nnot prestigious and he has friends who are making a lot more money but I am <br/>\nalways telling him that what he&#39;s doing is really important for those kids.<br/>\n    I think it&#39;s sad that so many of us feel inadequate because we focus too <br/>\nmuch on which gifts we lack rather than on those that shine in us.  Also, we <br/>\nneed to get way past the idea that our talents are only utilized well if we <br/>\nmake a lot of money from them.  There are so many different ways to live <br/>\nmeaningfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"John O. Andersen","from":"&quot;John O.
