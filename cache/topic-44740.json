It was really good.  <br/>\nThe kids enjoyed it and Devin was particularly amazed because of <br/>\nSamuel Clemmons becoming a writer...as that is what he wants to be.  <br/>\nDespite his great difficulty in writing a simple sentence, getting <br/>\nthe thoughts from mind to paper or even mind to mouth and his <br/>\nreluctance to read he wants to be a writer!  I think it is <br/>\nabsolutely wonderful.  He puts his khaki hiking vest on, puts a pen <br/>\nor pencil in the pocket (leaves sticking out to be sure it is <br/>\nvisible), sports his camoflauge hat with daddy sewn patches on it <br/>\nand last but not least a notebook under one arm.  He sometimes <br/>\nwrites in the car and in his bed, sometimes not at all for days.  <br/>\nBut he is a writer at heart and I imagine with the support, one day <br/>\nit will spread elsewhere.  Check out the movie if you haven&#39;t seen <br/>\nit.<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44685,"nextTopicId":44744}}
