We were unloading stuff into<br/>\nthe barn and the kids were settling the animals into pens.  I noticed an<br/>\nelderly couple watching the kids.  (Lots and lots of people stop to talk and<br/>\nask questions at stock shows so I didn&#39;t think anything about it.)  I went<br/>\nout for another load and when I came back in, these people were praying over<br/>\nmy kids!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdriane and Zach are fairly polite kids so they didn&#39;t say anything, just<br/>\nkind of stood there.  When I walked up, this little old lady says to me &quot;The<br/>\nkids just made a decision for Jesus.&quot;  I about puked.  I informed her the<br/>\nkids had been baptized for many years and sent her on her way.  The kids<br/>\nthought it was silly and I was furious.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt did give us a chance to talk about how we see God and none of us thought<br/>\nhe could be sold door to door like a vacuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56332,"nextTopicId":56075}}
