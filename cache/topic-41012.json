When <br/>\nthey give out the money, they tell you what you can do with it.  It&#39;s <br/>\nall about them telling you what THEY think you should be doing.  They <br/>\nthink it&#39;s good for kids to be in school, so they offer big <br/>\nincentives to keep them in school.  And they probably feel very self-<br/>\nrighteous about this &quot;good&quot; thing they&#39;re doing.  Kind of like a <br/>\nteacher handing out stickers for kids who learn their lessons well. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchools train us to live in a world where we accept these kinds of <br/>\nincentives.  Unschoolers are going to have these things to deal with, <br/>\nbut the more we deal with them and inform others why we deal with <br/>\nthem differently, the better chance we have of having an impact on <br/>\nthe world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know we hardly use our health insurance at all now that our family <br/>\nis being treated by a homeopath.  The insurance won&#39;t pay for a cent <br/>\nof it.  They want to discourage anything other than allopathic <br/>\nmedicine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember once when my insurance would have paid for a vaccination <br/>\nbut wouldn&#39;t pay for a blood test to see if the child was already <br/>\nimmune (turns out he was and didn&#39;t need the vaccination!)  And when <br/>\nI wanted to use infertility drugs, the insurance wouldn&#39;t pay for it <br/>\nbut they would&#39;ve paid for an abortion.
