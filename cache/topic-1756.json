I just had to wait until he could function well in that<br/>\n&gt; situation.  That is not to say that I didn&#39;t try things - I just didn&#39;t keep<br/>\n&gt; doing them if they didn&#39;t work well for my child or others.  It isn&#39;t good<br/>\n&gt; for children to be in situations that they can&#39;t handle either - no matter<br/>\n&gt; how much we think it might be good for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The hard bit is when you have other children, who then get angry that their fun<br/>\nhas been spoiled, so it&#39;s great if you can find a sympathetic friend who is<br/>\nwilling to take on your other children while you remove the disruptive one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think I hate the gifted label as much as I hate any other label.  Not<br/>\n&gt; every parent or child abuses it but I think it is so easy to misuse this<br/>\n&gt; information.  If it helps a parent find appropriate activities for the child<br/>\n&gt; great.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah. If it helps explain behaviour so that the child gets more stimulation,<br/>\ngreat. But it can put tremendous pressure on the child, and can be badly abused.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  No child is gifted in all areas.  I<br/>\n&gt; think it behooves us to remember that.  No matter how smart my son is about<br/>\n&gt; reading or numbers or facts or figures every other kid out there will<br/>\n&gt; probably be better than him at something.  Thank goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is interesting that even among gifted children groups there is much talk<br/>\nabout theories such as Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences, yet when it<br/>\ncomes down to it some sort of intelligences (interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic)<br/>\nare only accepted as such if they are associated with the more traditionally<br/>\nacademic areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Gifted children need to know<br/>\n&gt; this.  If not they feel better than others and confused when they can&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; something well.  It is almost setting them up for failure in life.  The<br/>\n&gt; statistics on Mensa people indicate that they are not all that successful in<br/>\n&gt; life.  Obviously some are successful but so are many people who don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; these amazing IQ&#39;s.  It is great for kids to feel that they are good at<br/>\n&gt; certain things but they also need to know that they don&#39;t have to be good at<br/>\n&gt; everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Very very important. So much talent is lost to suicide among these people<br/>\nbecause of low self esteem, due to unreal expectations of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of the big benefits of unschooling is that you can work with your child<br/>\n&gt; at whatever level they are capable of without having to compare to others.<br/>\n&gt; It is irrelevant to the child that they are reading at 5th grade level when<br/>\n&gt; they are 4.  How does that help them learn more stuff in interesting ways?<br/>\n&gt; How does that help them be a better person?  How does that help the parent<br/>\n&gt; you are telling whose 9 year old isn&#39;t reading?  How does it make others<br/>\n&gt; want to interact with your child?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Great points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is great to feel proud of your<br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s achievements but the child must feel that you are proud of them not<br/>\n&gt; what they can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve become uncomfortable with the whole concept of &#39;pride&#39;. It seems like if I<br/>\nam proud of my child&#39;s achievements, I am somehow taking ownership of the<br/>\nachievement for myself, and away from the child???

I spoke to one of the teachers about it and she<br/>\nsaid that her brother had ADD.  She told me that if you see a child with ADD<br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to wonder if they need help you know it.  There is a big<br/>\ndifference in treating a child like this and medicating a large group of<br/>\nchildren who do not fit into the classroom situation.  Because doctors and<br/>\nteachers (who seem to make many of these diagnoses) don&#39;t differentiate<br/>\nbetween the children with clinical ADD and those who are medicated for the<br/>\nconvenience of the teacher (and often the parent) it is difficult to discuss<br/>\nthe issue.  Many of us live with children who would be diagnosed as ADD if<br/>\nthey were in the school system and we know our kids do not need medication.<br/>\nI would not assume that all children labeled ADD are misdiagnosed and I<br/>\nwould not pretend to know what it is like to live with these children.<br/>\nBasically, we are talking about apples and oranges here but society&#39;s label<br/>\nis the same.  It would be cumbersome to always write &quot;those children who are<br/>\nlabeled ADD but are fine (although challenging)  if they are not in school&quot;.<br/>\nUsing labels in e-mail is a real problem.  In a face to face discussion you<br/>\nwould say - well I am not talking about children with clinical ADD or some<br/>\nsuch thing and the other person wouldn&#39;t be feeling judged.  Yet if you have<br/>\nto clarify the label every time you use it - it would be impossible to read.<br/>\nNot sure what the answer is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very difficult for parents to buck the teachers if they are<br/>\nrecommending Ritalin.  If the parent believes that the schools/teachers know<br/>\nwhat they are doing they think it will help their child succeed.  I think<br/>\nthat it is also often a relief for the parents who have been struggling with<br/>\n&quot;controlling&quot; these kids and trying to get them to conform.  Most people and<br/>\nparticularly parents who don&#39;t have spirited children are very ready and<br/>\nvocal in telling you that your parenting is the problem.  That you are<br/>\nfailing your child by not making them behave appropriately.  What a relief<br/>\nto be told that your child has a medical problem that he/she can be treated<br/>\nfor.  What a relief that their grades in school will improve and that the<br/>\nteacher will no longer be &quot;picking&quot; on your child.  Although I strongly<br/>\ndisagree with these parents decision to medicate (not talking about true ADD<br/>\nhere) I do understand and I do believe that many if not most parents are<br/>\ndoing what they believe is the best thing for their child.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44122,"nextTopicId":44194}}
