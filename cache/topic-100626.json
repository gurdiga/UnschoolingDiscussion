My 11yo dd is not doing math and reading as are her ps peers - or her hs peers (as far as anyone is willing to disclose).  I will tell you what helps me.  I focus on all the wonders, beauty and amazing things she is doing. And when my fear pushes me into the comparison headset i stop and recognize all the things that she does that are unique to her and that none (or few) of her peers (by age) might be doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part of the situation has been other peoples perceptions.  Primarily family because outside of family no one seems to notice (at this point most people just assume the skills are there already).  It helped tremendously for my dh to go to the LiveandLearn conference and to never hear from anyone - &quot;you&#39;re kidding, she&#39;s not reading yet...have you had her tested?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does require my assistance in anything that requires reading.  And while at times it would be nice to have a dd who is more independent in this area it does not seem to reflect in anyway her ability to cope with the world or her intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always had complete confidence in the inevitability of her learning to read.  However, in the past year i&#39;ve been challenged by my unschooling friends to consider the possibility that she may never be fully literate.  It&#39;s been really enlightening to once again recognize a preconceived expectation that i need to let go of.  Though, as i continue to see her growing in this area (albeit in slow motion - as i call it) i still have confidence that it will happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100620,"nextTopicId":100634}}
