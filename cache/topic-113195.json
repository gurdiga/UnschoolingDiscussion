The children are ready to go with tons of energy!  Let them bike or hike this energy away  in a hike-bike event during the week of May 24th through the 30th. Pick a day and time, advertise for other homeschoolers/unschoolers to join you in the newspaper or your group, and have fun while the children burn the excess energy off and enjoy the great outdoors!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot hard to do and a fun and nature filled day! See many new plants beginning to grow, find some animal tracks, identify rocks and trees while you bike or hike! Can be as along as hours or as short as you want!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo group around to do this with/ ask a friends family and so one on your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee our website for a press release and more information!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freewebs.com/homeschoolhikebike/\">http://www.freewebs.com/homeschoolhikebike/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send us some pictures!<br/>\nSet your event up today and let us know the details!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Spring!<br/>\nEarlene Sorrells</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113194,"nextTopicId":113196}}
