When I did shows I<br/>\nwould basically recruit people I knew, or shoppers in the store. I never<br/>\nwent through agents. <br/>\nAs far as the artsy stuff, I have a copy of a fashion body form that I<br/>\ncan send or fax to you. Your daughter can practice drawing on that. If<br/>\nyou can&#39;t find a copy of *WWD*, maybe a copy of Vogue will give her<br/>\ninspiration. Another thing I thought of was a book I read years ago. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember if it was a biography, or autobiography, but it told the<br/>\nlife story of Gloria Vanderbilt. Might be something to look into.<br/>\nAs far as the sewing stuff, do you have a machine? I can send you some<br/>\nextra fabric, and ideas and stuff. If you don&#39;t, I am probably about an<br/>\nhour and half away. If you feel like taking a road trip, we can plan a<br/>\nsewing day.
