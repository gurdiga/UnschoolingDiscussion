It&#39;s quite different than Gore<br/>\nor Bush or Bore or Gush.   He&#39;s predicted to get 15% of the vote in<br/>\nAlaska.  He&#39;s bringing out some important issues.  Nader is from the<br/>\nGreen Party.  I have no idea of his stand on homeschooling.  His running<br/>\nmate is a Native American gal from a Minnesota Indian Reservation.  The<br/>\nproblem with a third party in this election is that mostly only<br/>\nRepublicans and Democrats have a chance.  Next Tues. at our<br/>\nhomeschooling meeting we will be discussing the upcoming election.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry<br/>\nFrom Upper Michigan,USA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13602,"nextTopicId":13622}}
