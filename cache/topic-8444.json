With Ms. Kugai&#39;s cooperation, KnoK NEWS has <br/>\nrecently translated, expanded and updated that original Japanese Q & A <br/>\nlist into English. We share the latter part of that listing with you now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKugai, along with her partner, Mr. Junichi Ono, and their 14-year-old <br/>\ndaughter, Momo, have been homelearners for more than six years. Kugai <br/>\nalso heads a support group called &quot;Home Schooling Network - Himeji&quot; in <br/>\nthe city of Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan. (The group&#39;s <br/>\nJapanese homepage is at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/\">http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nKugai&#39;s family and homelearning activities have been reported on Japanese <br/>\nTV, as well as in Japanese newspaper and magazine articles. The Kyoto <br/>\nShimbun, a major metro daily newspaper in the Japanese city of Kyoto, <br/>\njust last month carried a few articles on Kugai and other regional <br/>\nhomelearning activities; the stories came across as supportive of <br/>\nhome-based learning in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may remember that in Part 1 of our Q & A listing, sent out about a <br/>\nmonth ago, we introduced some of the basic questions being asked by <br/>\nJapanese families about homelearning. We also touched upon some of the <br/>\ngeneral legal issues concerning home education (i.e., It is *not* against <br/>\nthe law for children to learn at home in Japan).<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 2 of our Q & A listing by Tomiko Kugai covers topics that are more <br/>\nspecific to Japan, such as *fu-toko* (avoiding school), and the <br/>\neducational challenges young homelearners in Japan may face as they get <br/>\nolder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs mentioned last time, we hope to take a deeper, more comprehensive look <br/>\nin the future at legal and other issues as they relate to homelearning in <br/>\nJapan. For now, however, we offer this Q & A overview in the spirit of <br/>\nhonest, open information-exchange and networking.<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   *   *   *<br/>\n<br/>\n          *  Q & A ON HOMESCHOOLING IN JAPAN -- Part 2  *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-12: EXACTLY HOW DO FAMILIES IN JAPAN GET STARTED IN HOMESCHOOLING? WHAT <br/>\nKIND OF STEPS DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-12: In many cases in Japan, families start out homeschooling through <br/>\n*fu-toko* (school avoidance) on the part of their child: Parents think <br/>\ntheir child has a problem, so they go through counseling and prepare to <br/>\nsend the child back to school through so-called corrective facilities <br/>\n[kyosei shisetsu], such as an &quot;adjustment guidance room&quot; [*teki-o shido <br/>\nkyo-shitsu*] at school, a municipal &quot;child consultation center&quot; [jido <br/>\nsodan-jo] or a &quot;free school&quot; program.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, there are those exceedingly few parents in Japan who <br/>\nare finding a problem with the methods of school itself, and they go on <br/>\nto choose learning at home as a way to raise their children. In such a <br/>\ncase, the homeschooling child&#39;s name will continue to be listed on the <br/>\nschool register in Japan, so there would be no need to individually <br/>\nnotify the local board of education. Once parents have notified officials <br/>\nat the school of their child&#39;s desire to learn at home, that is generally <br/>\nsufficient in many cases.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a slowly rising number of households in Japan that are <br/>\nchoosing homeschooling from the very beginning. Here, too, there are no <br/>\nfixed procedures in Japan for dealing with homeschooling, so many <br/>\nhomeschooling parents find it easier at this stage to go through the <br/>\nformal motion of registering with the school, and then inform school <br/>\nofficials at that time of the child&#39;s intent to learn at home, instead of <br/>\nat school.      <br/>\n<br/>\nQ-13: WHAT HAPPENS IF A FAMILY IN JAPAN INTENDING TO HOMESCHOOL RECEIVES <br/>\nNO COOPERATION FROM EDUCATION/SCHOOL OFFICIALS? WHAT RECOURSE DOES THE <br/>\nFAMILY HAVE?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-13: It used to be that a child in Japan who didn&#39;t show up for school <br/>\nwould not be moved up a grade or would not be allowed to graduate -- but <br/>\nthis was for *fu-toko*, not for homeschooling in particular. And even <br/>\nthen, such actions by a school against *fu-toko*, for the most part, are <br/>\nrarely taken nowadays. There are the occasional cases of a school <br/>\nprincipal -- usually one who possesses little understanding of the matter <br/>\n-- making such threatening statements, but the Ministry of Education is <br/>\ntelling school officials these days to refrain from such actions. If a <br/>\nhomeschooling family finds itself facing such a situation, it can -- with <br/>\nthe backing of a support group, for example -- obtain the actual facts <br/>\nfrom various areas in Japan and present that information to the school <br/>\nprincipal during discussions. (Taking the case to a local board of <br/>\neducation in Japan usually proves futile, and unfortunately no other <br/>\nofficial organization exists to mediate such matters between a family and <br/>\nschool.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of whether or not there are restrictions on graduation, it is <br/>\nstill possible for a child to proceed to a higher school level by taking <br/>\nand passing tests sanctioned by the Education Ministry, such as those for <br/>\ngraduating from middle school [*Chu-gaku Kentei*] and entering university <br/>\n[*Dai-gaku Kentei*].     <br/>\n<br/>\nQ-14: ARE THERE ANY COURT CASES IN JAPAN BEING HEARD AT PRESENT ON THE <br/>\nSPECIFIC ISSUE OF HOMESCHOOLING?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-14:  There are none at present, as far as I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-15: AUTHORITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES TEND TO CONFUSE HOMESCHOOLING WITH <br/>\n&quot;CHILD NEGLECT&quot; OR &quot;CHILD ABUSE.&quot; IS THIS A PROBLEM IN JAPAN TOO?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-15: There is always the possibility of such confusion occurring. But <br/>\nwhere homeschooling itself is concerned in Japan, the relevant <br/>\nauthorities for the most part don&#39;t make it a point to come to the home <br/>\nand check on things. So there doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-16: HOW MANY HOMESCHOOLING SUPPORT GROUPS ARE THERE THROUGHOUT JAPAN?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-16: There are about 10 independent support groups in Japan, like &quot;HSN <br/>\nHimeji,&quot; that have no religious affiliation. Many families in Japan are <br/>\nalso registered with &quot;free schools&quot; such as Tokyo Shure that have <br/>\nhomeschooling support programs, and with overseas schools like Clonlara <br/>\nin the United States. There are other Christian-affiliated support groups <br/>\nin Japan too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nQ-17: WHAT IS A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A &quot;TYPICAL HOMESCHOOLER&quot; LIKE IN <br/>\nJAPAN? ARE ALL HOMESCHOOLERS THE SAME?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-17: Homeschooling differs with every home. In our family, for instance, <br/>\nhomeschooling is centered around our child&#39;s interests. So, excluding <br/>\ntime for meals and household chores, our child herself decides how each <br/>\nday is spent. She reads books, paints pictures, cooks, does workbooks, <br/>\nwatches TV -- it changes with her interests and moods. Once a week, she <br/>\ngoes to the library and checks out books. We as a family also participate <br/>\nin our support group functions, do some shopping, go to the movies. So we <br/>\nspend a lot of time outside as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-18: WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL STANCE OF JAPAN&#39;S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION ON <br/>\nHOMESCHOOLING? HOW DOES THAT STANCE AFFECT HOMESCHOOLERS&#39; DAILY LIVES?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-18: The Japanese government has issued no official opinion on <br/>\nhomeschooling one way or the other. The ministry did, in 1992, issue a <br/>\nstatement on *fu-toko* [school avoidance] to the effect that: &quot;As any <br/>\nchild is likely to turn to avoiding school at any time, children need not <br/>\nbe forced to return to school.&quot; This signaled the government&#39;s apparent <br/>\nrecognition that to continue pushing school avoiders to go back to school <br/>\ncould worsen an already serious problem. Following this statement by the <br/>\nministry, school officials nationwide have generally softened their <br/>\nstance on children who avoid school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for those who homeschool: Though there may be exceptions, the ministry <br/>\nfor the most part does not interfere in the daily lives of homeschooling <br/>\nfamilies at present, neither encouraging nor discouraging such activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-19: WHAT HAS JAPANESE MEDIA COVERAGE OF HOMESCHOOLING BEEN LIKE?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-19: The Japanese mass media have been covering homeschooling in Japan <br/>\nas an issue since around 1993. At first, many news stories focused on how <br/>\nto remedy the rising numbers of &quot;school-avoiding children.&quot; But recently, <br/>\nmedia coverage in Japan has been treating homeschooled children&#39;s own <br/>\npersonalities and self-determination more seriously; as such, media <br/>\nstories these days are introducing homeschooling in Japan as a new <br/>\nlearning alternative to school.    <br/>\n<br/>\nQ-20: HOW DO THE RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS AND COMMUNITIES OF HOMESCHOOLING <br/>\nFAMILIES IN JAPAN REACT TO HOME-BASED LEARNING?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-20: Among those people who are actually familiar with homeschooling <br/>\nfamilies or are aware of the educational growth of homeschooled children, <br/>\nthere seems to a broadening of understanding, though it is hard to say to <br/>\nwhat extent. (This, of course, may also depend on the region in Japan. <br/>\nThere seems to be little interference in homeschooling matters in urban <br/>\nareas, anyway.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nQ-21: DON&#39;T HOMESCHOOLED CHILDREN NEED A DIPLOMA OF SOME KIND TO GET INTO <br/>\nUNIVERSITY? DO THEY STILL NEED TO TAKE JAPAN&#39;S INFAMOUS UNIVERSITY <br/>\nENTRANCE EXAMS?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-21: There are two ways to enter college or university in Japan: by <br/>\ngraduating from high school or by passing the Education <br/>\nMinistry-sanctioned university entrance test (*Dai-gaku Kentei*). It is <br/>\nnot necessary to graduate from primary school, middle school or high <br/>\nschool to TAKE the *Dai-gaku Kentei*. It should be noted, however, that <br/>\npassing this test would merely qualify a person to take university <br/>\nentrance exams; a homeschooler wanting to enter a university would still <br/>\nhave to take the entrance exams of the university she/he wanted to get <br/>\ninto, just like other applicants.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-22: ARE JAPANESE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACCEPTING HOMESCHOOLED <br/>\n&quot;STUDENTS&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-22: If a homeschooler passes a college&#39;s or university&#39;s own entrance <br/>\nexams, there would be no problem getting in. There is no special system <br/>\nset up for homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ-23: DO HOMESCHOOLERS IN JAPAN HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO GET <br/>\nSATISFACTORY JOBS? CAN THEY SURVIVE IN THE COMPETITIVE JAPANESE JOB MARKET?<br/>\n<br/>\nA-23: We don&#39;t know much about this area yet, since the homeschooling <br/>\nmovement in Japan is rather young and the numbers of children being <br/>\nraised through homeschooling are comparatively few in Japanese society. <br/>\nEven so, it can be said with some certainty that lots of homeschooled <br/>\nchildren in Japan are broadening their capabilities and that they have an <br/>\nabundance of will to try things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcademic record is still regarded as important for fighting it out in the <br/>\nJapanese job market. But just because somebody is a homeschooler doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean the roads to higher education are closed in Japan: Former &quot;school <br/>\navoiders&quot; go on to graduate from university and do well as adults in the <br/>\nbusiness world; many of them work in a variety of fields as newspaper <br/>\nreporters, teachers and so on. And of course, there are many working <br/>\npeople who have never been to college.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor homeschoolers, it is their own efforts and abilities that count most. <br/>\nMany people who choose homeschooling tend to place a higher value on <br/>\nwhether or not they are playing the leading role in their own lives, or <br/>\nwhether or not they are truly happy, rather than on social success or <br/>\nfighting to victory in competition.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[End]<br/>\n<br/>\n                           *   *   *   *<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n             WISH I&#39;D SAID THAT  (Quote of the Day):<br/>\n<br/>\n*On knowledge....<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To know is to exist; to exist is to be involved, to move about, to see <br/>\nthe world with my own eyes.&quot;   <br/>\n   --Alice Walker, *In Search of Our Mothers&#39; Gardens*, 1983</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8443,"nextTopicId":8445}}
