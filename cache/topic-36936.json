If that is the correct interpretation, it is indeed reason to be<br/>\nconcerned. As a close to home example (my husband is an architect), an<br/>\narchitect usually has a Bachelors degree and experience working under a<br/>\nlicensed architect before receiving a state license. Since you have to pass<br/>\na state licensing exam, too, it seems that having the additional requirement<br/>\nof a high school diploma from an accredited school is ridiculous. Passage of<br/>\nbills like these could limit our kids&#39; choices. We have tried to discourage<br/>\nour two from going into architecture (considering it an expensive hobby),<br/>\nbut there are plenty of other state licensed occupations that they might<br/>\nchoose to pursue?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRicka Gerstmann<br/>\nThe Resourceful Homeschooler<br/>\nMaterials to involve, inspire and support independent learners of all ages<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.resourcefulhomeschooler.com\">http://www.resourcefulhomeschooler.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12162,"nextTopicId":36943}}
