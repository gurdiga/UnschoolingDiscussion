","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-874113941\">&quot;Its seems that some of the most popular books out thier about<br/>\nhomeschooling that talk mostly about kids that are gifted (atleasts<br/>\nthats how I percieve it).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure who originally wrote this.  But reading it raised two<br/>\nquestions in my mind:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, to what books are you referring?  I&#39;m scouring the globe<br/>\n(metaphorically speaking) for books on homeschooling that aren&#39;t so<br/>\nlimited to the mid-curve that they&#39;re utterly useless for my gifted<br/>\nson.  I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve not yet ventured into the &quot;family memoir&quot;<br/>\nsub-genre; I&#39;ve been focussing my attention on those that are written as<br/>\nguides, or collections of tips, or resource directories, as collecting<br/>\nenough material to keep a rich environment at his ever-changing level is<br/>\nmore relevant to me than reading about someone else&#39;s experience at the<br/>\nmoment.  The books I&#39;ve seen are packed with tips on &quot;age appropriate&quot;<br/>\nactivities that are not the least appropriate for him--either because he<br/>\ncan&#39;t physically perform the indicated action until he&#39;s long past being<br/>\ninterested in the intended lesson, or because he&#39;s just not engaged by<br/>\nwhat&#39;s aimed at the sensibilities of a child 2-3 times his age.  They<br/>\nprominently feature &quot;developmental timetables&quot; that resemble nothing<br/>\nthat will EVER happen in this house.  They burgeon with guidelines on<br/>\nhow to reinforce information in which he is just becoming deeply<br/>\ninterested by referencing &quot;everyday&quot; concepts which are familiar to a<br/>\nchild at the &quot;right age&quot; for learning X, Y, and Z. . .but totally<br/>\nforeign to my son, who already knows X, has a reasonable grasp of Y, and<br/>\nis doggedly pursuing an understanding of Z without benefit of said<br/>\nreinforcement.  The books I most often see lauded as indispensable on<br/>\nhomeschooling mailing lists typically prove to hold little utility for<br/>\nus, BECAUSE my son is gifted.  My observation up to this point has been<br/>\nthat the literature (even when it purports to cover the full spectrum)<br/>\nis heavily weighted toward children in the middle ranges of the IQ<br/>\nchart, and that anyone whose child(ren) fall into that range has a much,<br/>\nmuch broader pool of relevant resources on which to draw.  I would truly<br/>\nLOVE to get a booklist from you that would alter that perception.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, what makes you so sure the kids mentioned in those books are<br/>\ngifted?  I mean, do their authors say, &quot;Sarah, a gifted nine-year-old,<br/>\nhas learnt to play Mozart on the violin. . .&quot;, or are you assuming that<br/>\nSarah MUST be gifted in order to have done so?  If the latter, I&#39;m<br/>\nsomewhat confused.  If you&#39;re going to assign the title &quot;gifted&quot; to<br/>\nevery high achiever, doesn&#39;t that guarantee that, definitionally, no<br/>\nnon-gifted child will ever BE a high achiever, no matter what they do,<br/>\nand, therefore, that every book that mentions achievement WILL be about<br/>\na gifted child?  It sounds like circular logic to me.  If the books ARE<br/>\nabout gifted children explicitly, well, O.K., so why feel inadequate?  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t remember the basketball coach at my old highschool ever looking<br/>\nout at a room full of 5&#39;10&quot; and under sophomores who couldn&#39;t hit a<br/>\nthree-point shot to save their lives and saying, &quot;If I don&#39;t produce an<br/>\nNBA all-star in this group, I&#39;ll know I&#39;m a rotten coach.&quot;  I doubt<br/>\nreading a biography of Shaquille O&#39;Neal would make him do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that your true complaint has nothing to do with giftedness, but<br/>\nis about achievement and the pressure to achieve, which is an ENTIRELY<br/>\ndifferent, and at best tangentially related, issue.  Moreover, the<br/>\npressure seems to be something you&#39;re generating yourself, which<br/>\ncertainly can&#39;t be blamed on those who homeschool gifted kids or those<br/>\nwho write about them.  Those books (whatever they may be) which inspired<br/>\nyour complaint trouble you because you compare your child(ren)&#39;s (and by<br/>\nextension your own) ACHIEVEMENT to that of the children (and parents)<br/>\nmentioned in them.  So, don&#39;t.  I know that may seem flippant, but it&#39;s<br/>\njust a straightforward acknowledgment of the only solution to the<br/>\nproblem.  You decide what you concentrate on.  My son will not excel in<br/>\neverything.  He will not even ever dip into most things--no one could.<br/>\nSuch is the nature of our world, so richly diverse that a hundred<br/>\nlifetimes will not permit us to experience its every facet.  Do I weep<br/>\nthat he might never be a banana farmer?  Does it trouble me that he may<br/>\nhave been born without the capacity to someday stand as one of history&#39;s<br/>\ngreatest pearl-divers?  Do I worry that I must be a poor mother and a<br/>\nworse teacher if he reaches adulthood lacking the skills to be a<br/>\nsnakecharmer?  Of course not.  He&#39;s him, and entirely sufficient in<br/>\nhimself.  If I teach him that, and help him acquire the skills to make<br/>\nhis life what he wants it to be, I will have done an unimpeachable job<br/>\nof raising AND teaching him, no matter what he does or doesn&#39;t achieve<br/>\nin the eyes of others.  And they can write all the books they want about<br/>\nanything they want without altering that simple fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty Blagg<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:athterath@...\">athterath@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14925,"nextTopicId":14955}}
