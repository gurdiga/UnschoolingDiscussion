I was in the kitchen cooking <br/>\nand cleaning.  I thought that was plenty respectable!  But Marty, who was 13 <br/>\nand pretty disdainful of religion, came over and subtly turned down and then <br/>\noff the &quot;Chef Aid&quot; South Park CD I was listening to.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood thinking, Marty!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are lots of videos and music we will turn off for the sake of <br/>\nhomeschooling kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I was in the car, though, listening to the oldies station, and I <br/>\nnotice in the rearview mirror there&#39;s a hushed but fast conversation going on <br/>\nbetween Holly and a friend of hers, who&#39;s covering her ears, but still trying <br/>\nto hear Holly&#39;s questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe song which was too offensive for her was &quot;Under the Boardwalk.&quot;  But <br/>\nshe&#39;s too respectful of adults to ask me to turn that horribly nasty song off <br/>\nin her Christian presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a dilemma for her.  It was an irritation for me, because musically <br/>\n&quot;Under the Boardwalk is wonderful.   But it does say &quot;we&#39;ll be making love,&quot; <br/>\nand she couldn&#39;t hear that phrase without the taint of sin.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this week we were babysitting kids from a Christian family.  Holly <br/>\nand Kirby needed to leave to go to a Harry Potter tournament.  Holly didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to say &quot;Harry Potter&quot; to them.

I becamse dissatisfied with <br/>\nevangelical theology. I&#39;ve always been a person who had to <br/>\nunderstand who was going to heaven and who wasn&#39;t. We were <br/>\nmissionaries for pete&#39;s sake. I went on a major search through <br/>\nevery possible permutation of how salvation theology has been <br/>\nconceived and it led me to a place of less clarity and more <br/>\nirritation with traditional teachings. That&#39;s led us out of church <br/>\nand into a sort of spiritual no-man&#39;s land. We&#39;ve always been <br/>\narts focused and open to culture, too which is somewhat less <br/>\nembraced in the homeschooling world we&#39;re in. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt times I feel like I am in a foreign country at our homeschool <br/>\ngatherings. My kids are passionate HP fans, for instance. My <br/>\n11yos wore an HP t-shirt to our hoemschool co-op and got <br/>\nopenly ridiculed by his friends. One friend worried that he would <br/>\ngo to hell or become involved in witchcraft. Then my oldest (14 at <br/>\nthe time) in his ASL (sign language) class had to endure the <br/>\nteacher skipping the lesson for the day to warn him against the <br/>\nevils of HP since his mother didn&#39;t seem to understand how bad <br/>\nthe books were. This really riled me up. She and I got into it after <br/>\nthe class. An adult using her position of power to shame my kid <br/>\nabout something we totally approved in the home. Outrageous!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was most bugged that she took our one hour per week class <br/>\nperiod and wasted it. And I was especially upset that my kdis <br/>\nhave been the focus of really harsh comments by friends who tell <br/>\nthem things like, &quot;How can you listen to a band that is going to <br/>\nhell?&quot; (Metallica) or &quot;How can you be friends with a fag?&quot; to my <br/>\ndaughter who knows and loves some gay friends she has on the <br/>\nInternet. This kind of thinking so upsets me that I can hardly <br/>\nstand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ve been evangelical Christians for over twenty years. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t until the last three years when I started studying theology <br/>\nthat the conservative worldview of faith came crumbling down for <br/>\nme. I started with Hans Kung (liberal Catholic) and have since <br/>\nread Marcus Borg, Bishop Spong, Richard Holloway and others <br/>\nwho have rejected fundamentalism and have embraced a less <br/>\ndogmatic view of faith. Not sure where we&#39;ll shake out in all this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids would love to make friends outside their current circle <br/>\n(not to replace those kids completely but to have the chance to <br/>\nshare their passionate interests without ridicule).

I can do both. Thanks <br/>\nSandra for posting the results of your search.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a place (Cincinnati Sci-Fi) that sells comics and <br/>\ngaming stuff right nearby and I hadn&#39;t even imagined that kids <br/>\ngather there to play1 Will check that out right away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe library is also a great idea. My kids are currently on the teen <br/>\nboard there and organize events all the time. Will suggest they <br/>\nsuggest organizing a night for gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis switch from one world (conservative Christian <br/>\nhomeschoolers) to the next is odd. &quot;Fallin&#39; off the sidewalk/My <br/>\nlips move but I can&#39;t talk...&quot; (Bono, U2, &quot;Tryin&#39; to Throw Your Arms <br/>\nAround the World&quot;) but I&#39;m getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55801,"nextTopicId":55812}}
