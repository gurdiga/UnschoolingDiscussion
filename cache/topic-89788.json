You can rent costumes at the Visitor&#39;s Center (the one in town is closed for the winter). Although it&#39;s pricy, it is sooo much fun! I would do this over a carriage ride, given the choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso try to see the Powell House (It&#39;s just outside the main village area, behind the Capitol. There&#39;s lots of hands-on stuff there (you can climb on the bed to try it out) and a working kitchen. The fife and drum parade is lots of fun too, and you can follow it as it goes by.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!

We are so excited.. We are going with another unschooling <br/>\nfamily, 3 daughters and the mother.   We have never been to Wlmsbrg, <br/>\nalthough the other family has been before.   If anyone has been to <br/>\nColonial Williamsburg, do you have any &quot;must sees&quot;?   The main <br/>\ndecision we have to make is whether or not to do Jamestown/Yorktown.  <br/>\nWe are on a budget, and we may not have enough to buy tickets to <br/>\nthose attractions.   The other family IS going To JT/YT, but they are <br/>\nnot buying tickets to  Col. Wlmbsbrg, since they have been before.  <br/>\nWe are buying the Heritage passes for Wlmsbrg, which are good for a <br/>\nyear.   Anything mentionable about the area, the attractions, <br/>\nrestuarants, etc.. would be appreciated.   I am taking a laptop, so I <br/>\nwill be able to check my email.  Oh, for those who do not know me, my <br/>\nkids are dd, 14, ds, 12 and ds 8, so they are all old enough to do <br/>\nsome &quot;intensive&quot; touring and to enjoy the exhibits.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTHANKS<br/>\nTeresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87356,"nextTopicId":89598}}
