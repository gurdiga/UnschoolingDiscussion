I saw this quote this<br/>\non a word origins list:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention <br/>\nof its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of<br/>\nattention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the<br/>\noverabundance of information sources that might consume it. -Herbert<br/>\nAlexander Simon, economist, Nobel laureate (1916-2001)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just had the sudden picture of presidents and their advisors, how<br/>\nimpossible it is that every decision the president makes is his own. <br/>\nI mean, the information that&#39;s considered of key importance for the<br/>\npresident&#39;s consideration.  How does that get decided?  There&#39;s<br/>\nsomething wrong with that picture, but it&#39;s likely to be something I<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to myself and my family being able to choose for themselves the<br/>\ninformation each person finds valueable...
