It can be deadly, quickly for little<br/>\ndogs.  The equivelancy ratios, if I remember correctly is 1 oz baking<br/>\nchocolate, 3 oz. semisweet and 10 oz milk chocolate.  Weights, and I&#39;m doing<br/>\nthis from memory, works out to 1 oz milk chocolate per pound of dogs weight,<br/>\n3/10 oz semisweet/lb. dog weight and 1/10 oz baking chocolate/lb. dog weight<br/>\nare the toxic doses.<br/>\n<br/>\nChocolate has theobromine in it.  Dogs acquire a taste for it once they have<br/>\nit and  they don&#39;t have as acute a sense of taste, so they can &quot;smell&quot; the<br/>\nchocolate but they can&#39;t &quot;taste&quot; the difference between the bitter and sweet<br/>\nchocolates.

Sometimes I call the shots <br/>\nand control the behavior, too, without waiting for the child to learn, all on <br/>\nher own, from her mistakes. One example that comes to mind is that I told one <br/>\nchild today to stop feeding chocolate chip cookies to the dog and when she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t move fast enough and the dog was about to gulp down more cookies, I <br/>\nreached out and took the plate and put it out of the dog&#39;s reach. Now, I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it nastily and I didn&#39;t yell and I didn&#39;t punish her for feeding <br/>\nthe dog in the first place and I did suggest to her that she could find some <br/>\nalternative treat to feed the dog.  But, although there are undoubtedly <br/>\npeople here who are also followers of the noncoercive parenting philosophy, <br/>\nmost unschoolers are probably going to (respectfully, of course) call the <br/>\nshots and control behavior sometimes. We just aren&#39;t going to coerce kids <br/>\ninto learning according to a school schedule in a schoolish way. Past that - <br/>\nwhen we get into parenting issues - I&#39;d imagine that unschoolers tend to be <br/>\non the less coercive end of the spectrum - but not to the point that they <br/>\ncould say they are truly noncoercive parents (as in the Taking Children <br/>\nSeriously/Sarah Lawrence meaning).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling discussion","postDate":"1018329799","msgId":34290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxM2YwMWMxZGY5MCQzODVlYjRlMCQ0OTVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDAzNjEwMWMxZGY0ZCRiMzA3ZTc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBjb2F0c3YwMS5wYS5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPHAwNTAwMTkzMGI4ZDdjZDlkNDZjMEBbMjA4LjI2LjIzNS4yMDRdPg=="},"prevInTopic":34289,"nextInTopic":34291,"prevInTime":34289,"nextInTime":34291,"topicId":34279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welll, it just seemed/seems contrary to the whole unschooling life style/mind set--allowing folks to make mistakes and learn from them without a parent/teacher","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1898767921\">Welll, it just seemed/seems contrary to the whole unschooling life<br/>\nstyle/mind set--allowing folks to make mistakes and learn from them without<br/>\na parent/teacher etc., calling the shots and controlling the behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\nAn expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a<br/>\nvery narrow field.<br/>\n            -- Niels Bohr<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Helen Hegener&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, April 08, 2002 3:53 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling discussion<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; At 6:35 PM -0400 4/8/2002, Mary Broussard wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just wanted to say that I have really appreciated this discussion<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the last couple of days.

Etc. Even quizzes <br/>\nthat test your knowledge are fun - that&#39;s what trivia games are (fun for some <br/>\nof us, not for everybody, I know). And quizzes are useful for testing our <br/>\nlearning about something too -- what isn&#39;t fun is being forced to &quot;learn&quot; <br/>\n(using the term very loosely) something just FOR a quiz and then getting a <br/>\ngrade on what you managed to spit out on the quiz and then having your future <br/>\ndecided based on those kinds of grades. I can spell S-T-U-P-I-D AND it wasn&#39;t <br/>\never on a spelling test, either -- because when I was a kid it was a &quot;bad <br/>\nword&quot;! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1294635,"authorName":"Helen Hegener","from":"Helen Hegener &lt;HEM-Editor@...&gt;","profile":"hemhelen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling discussion","postDate":"1018306407","msgId":34281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNTAwMTkzMGI4ZDdjZDlkNDZjMEBbMjA4LjI2LjIzNS4yMDRdPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzNjEwMWMxZGY0ZCRiMzA3ZTc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBjb2F0c3YwMS5wYS5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAzNjEwMWMxZGY0ZCRiMzA3ZTc0MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBjb2F0c3YwMS5wYS5jb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":34279,"nextInTopic":34282,"prevInTime":34280,"nextInTime":34282,"topicId":34279,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
