I love K&#39;nex because for some reason Sam has more patience with <br/>\nthem than many building sets and he&#39;ll build and unbuild and rebuild again <br/>\nwithout feeling frustrated.  But this time he was starting to get frustrated <br/>\nand he explodes when he&#39;s frustrated (I&#39;ve just put in a request for &quot;The <br/>\nExplosive Child&quot; at the library - Thanks, Pam, for the recommendation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went over and made sure Nicky was out of the way and sat down with Sam <br/>\nand said something about maybe he could swith the black rod for a red <br/>\nconnected to a yellow cause I could see that the sides weren&#39;t going to be <br/>\nparallel the way he was building it.  &quot;NOOOOOOO!!!&quot; he screamed and I said <br/>\nsomething about not liking being screamed at when I was only trying to help.  <br/>\nHe tried something else that didn&#39;t work and he screamed again.  I&#39;m almost, <br/>\nbut not quite sure, that I bit my tongue and didn&#39;t say anything about how it <br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t work that way.  I&#39;m sure I made at least one other <br/>\nsuggestion and he screamed.  I said something about not wanting to be <br/>\nscreamed at and maybe I should get up and go in the other room.  &quot;NO!  Stay <br/>\nthere!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, do you want me to help you or not?&quot;  He shook his head angrily, not <br/>\nlooking up from his building.  &quot;But you want me to stay here?&quot;  He nodded, <br/>\nstill not looking at me.  I sighed exasperatedly, then took a few breaths, <br/>\nfidgeted, looked at the clock and the mess within arm&#39;s reach.  But he&#39;d made <br/>\nit pretty clear he just wanted me there, so I calmed down and just watched <br/>\nhim work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I was just BEING he got it to work even though his cross beam was <br/>\nlonger than the end pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\n(By the way, I think my behavior that day was a pretty good example of <br/>\n&quot;obtuse.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pam T.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43717,"nextTopicId":43759}}
