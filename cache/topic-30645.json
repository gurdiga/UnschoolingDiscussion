We call her rage behavior<br/>\n&quot;fits&quot;.  They started when she was 5.  At first they were very infrequent<br/>\nsay once a month, then became more and more frequent until they were every<br/>\nfew hours.  I knew something was wrong and talked to the pediatrician.  He<br/>\nrecommended a therapist.  The guy was awful.  First he said it was my fault<br/>\nthen he tried to pin the ADD label and some sort of defiant disorder thing<br/>\non her but he said thad didn&#39;t really fit because she knew she had a problem<br/>\nwith her temper and wanted some help.  Well he was no help at all.  As it<br/>\nturned out, my daughter was the one that actually figured it out.  I was<br/>\ngiving her some Triaminic medicine to try to relieve her very stuffy nose.<br/>\nBefore a dose, she said to me, &quot;I know how that stuff works, I take it, have<br/>\na fit which makes me cry a lot and then my nose runs&quot;.  I called the Dr. and<br/>\nasked if the yellow dye in the medicine could give my daughter behavior<br/>\nproblems.  He said it was unlikely that it was the dye but it could have<br/>\nbeen the active ingredient that made her a little anxious.  I told him I had<br/>\nnoticed behavior problems with her shortly after she at a blue snow cone<br/>\nonce.  He said that a Dr. Feingold developed a program for children with<br/>\nbehavior problems related to food additives.  The reason he did not mention<br/>\nit earlier was because it has not been clinically proven.  Through it all we<br/>\nhave determined that she is sensitive to artificial color, artificial<br/>\nflavor, BHT, TBHQ, and nitrates.  We have eliminated all of these things<br/>\nfrom her diet and she is a different person, she is 10 now.  It was very<br/>\ndifficult for her when she was in ps.  They offer candy as a reward for many<br/>\nthings.  She has developed a tremendous amount of self-control regarding her<br/>\nfood choices.  The hardest time of year is Halloween.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One more thing, she gets leg aches and wets her bed if there is something<br/>\nin her food that we didn&#39;t catch - never fails.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pat<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Nichoel<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 1:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Food sensitivites/dyes..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the subject of food sensitivities:<br/>\n&gt; My daughter (9 years old now) used to do what I call &#39;raging&#39;..From the<br/>\ntime she was 2 she would have these horrendous fits; at least once, most of<br/>\nthe time more times a day..When she was 2 I attributed it to her age and<br/>\nlack of ability to communicate fully her needs....As she got older I<br/>\nattributed it to having two different sets of rules between her dad and<br/>\nmyself..but then her dad passed on..So I attributed it to my unavailability<br/>\nas a parent (At this point she is ooh about 5 and I am working in corporate<br/>\nAmerica; so we are seeing each other less than 4 hours a day..)..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then when she was 6, I became a SAHM...the rages did not decrease in<br/>\nvelocity or in number even after 2 years of a very stable and loving<br/>\nenvironment..(She was still in PS at this point..) They were so *fierce*<br/>\nthat she even put her hand through her wall in her room..and they would last<br/>\nanywhere from 20 minutes on the short end, to 2 hours on the long end (This<br/>\nwas beginning of summer 2001, I pulled her from public school end of May<br/>\n2001 due to some issues with anxiety which she unfortunately inherited from<br/>\nme, and the fact that well frankly she wasnt doing anything but sitting in<br/>\nthe nurses office every day..and she was making herself sick at home so she<br/>\nwouldnt have to go to school..Didnt take long for me to realize I was doing<br/>\nher NO good by forcing her...and yanked her so fast I think the school&#39;s<br/>\nhead spun :&gt;...) Anyhow, back to the point of this post...I did a lot of<br/>\nresearch on conduct disorders, rage issues and the like...She was in therapy<br/>\nwith a wonderful therapist that used music therapy with kids (and had been<br/>\nso I knew that wasnt changing her raging, even though it was helping<br/>\nimmensely with her self esteem and the like)..Anyhow, it really helped her<br/>\nto work out her feelings..One of the things I happened upon in my research<br/>\nwas red dye 40.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now realize; our family is not one who eats organically all the time, back<br/>\nthen it was never organic..now I am more mindful of how we eat but we&#39;re<br/>\nstill not out of the processed food ....BUT I did eliminate red dye 40 from<br/>\nher diet completely..because I saw that almost *everything* she ate had it<br/>\nin it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It took about 2 weeks but the rages stopped. Completely. She has only<br/>\n&#39;raged&#39; once since we eliminated RD40; and that was after eating a red jello<br/>\nsalad at a church function :|...She is very aware of her sensitivity to the<br/>\ndye and for the most part checks on her own to make sure what she is<br/>\nbuying/wanting/eating doesnt have it in it..She is now a completely<br/>\ndifferent child, she is much less volatile, even when we dont agree with<br/>\neach other, or she&#39;s unable to do something she wants right then (which used<br/>\nto be a huge trigger, when I&#39;d say her friend couldnt stay the night due to<br/>\nour schedule the next day etc, a rage would ensue..) she is much more able<br/>\nto talk to and reason with..It just amazes me that the crap is still legal<br/>\n(RD40 is a petroleum based product..)..But it may be something that you want<br/>\nto look at if you are looking for possible food sensitivities being the<br/>\nreason for behavioral issues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;ramble off&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nichoel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fertility Friend Online Support Guide<br/>\n&gt; Now you CAN conceive online..<br/>\n&gt; www.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: debbie jones<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 10:39 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Milk and milk products<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Kolleen,<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks for all the great tips. I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I<br/>\never had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried<br/>\nsoy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were<br/>\ndrinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for<br/>\nlack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has.

What has changed in our society to bring this<br/>\non? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not<br/>\nhave the solution to the problem years ago?

My son is feeling very<br/>\ndeprived<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy),<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is<br/>\nprobably<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping.

Yet, cows milk is best digested by<br/>\nbaby<br/>\n&gt;   cows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Personally, I&#39;d rather have the real thing (yeah, my upbringing brought<br/>\n&gt;   this on) than have a substitute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather<br/>\n&gt;   than introduce another substitute?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when<br/>\n&gt;   butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my<br/>\n&gt;   bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my<br/>\n&gt;   choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found<br/>\n&gt;   repulsive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt;   great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made<br/>\n&gt;   cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic<br/>\n&gt;   shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?)<br/>\n&gt;   bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of<br/>\n&gt;   butter). They turned out great (hint, use 1/2 expresso chips and 1/2<br/>\n&gt;   semi-sweet chips, follow *almost* the entire Nestle Tollhouse recipe,<br/>\nuse<br/>\n&gt;   organic ingredients. The sugar was dehydrated cane and I just added some<br/>\n&gt;   molasses to make up for the lack of organic brown sugar)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The cheese part is a tough one. I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses<br/>\n&gt;   but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a<br/>\n&gt;   milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know<br/>\n&gt;   your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Debbie, good luck with the elimination.

If you are talking about the medical community such as AMA, I think they are too tied to the Drug companies otherwise why wouldn&#39;t the recognize the benefits of chiropractors yet?  Obviously it is not in their best interest!  I wonder why findings clinically proven?  Maybe he has but the AMA does their own tests to counter his findings and then gives the conflicting info to the medical community.  If I can tell the difference in my daughter, I&#39;m sure it could be proven in a test.  Last night my daughter was very grouchy and was complaining of leg aches.  We tried to think of what she might have eaten that was different.  It turned out to be BHT in refried beans.  I didn&#39;t even think to look at the can.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to beat a dead horse here but this is the same attitude I have about tv producers and advertisers.  I think they are secretly poisoning our children&#39;s minds and they know exactly what they are doing.  Like the food additives, it doesn&#39;t affect everyone, but my food sensitive dd, who never complains of boredom after a few days without tv or video games, goes into a rant because she has nothing to do after a weekend of too much tv.

At first they were <br/>\nvery infrequent say once a month, then became more and more frequent <br/>\nuntil they were every few hours.  I knew something was wrong and <br/>\ntalked to the pediatrician.  He recommended a therapist.  The guy was <br/>\nawful.  First he said it was my fault then he tried to pin the ADD <br/>\nlabel and some sort of defiant disorder thing on her but he said thad <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really fit because she knew she had a problem with her temper <br/>\nand wanted some help.  Well he was no help at all.  As it turned out, <br/>\nmy daughter was the one that actually figured it out.  I was giving <br/>\nher some Triaminic medicine to try to relieve her very stuffy nose.  <br/>\nBefore a dose, she said to me, &quot;I know how that stuff works, I take <br/>\nit, have a fit which makes me cry a lot and then my nose runs&quot;.  I <br/>\ncalled the Dr. and asked if the yellow dye in the medicine could give <br/>\nmy daughter behavior problems.  He said it was unlikely that it was <br/>\nthe dye but it could have been the active ingredient that made her a <br/>\nlittle anxious.  I told him I had noticed behavior problems with her <br/>\nshortly after she at a blue snow cone once.  He said that a Dr. <br/>\nFeingold developed a program for children with behavior problems <br/>\nrelated to food additives.  The reason he did not mention it earlier <br/>\nwas because it has not been clinically proven.  Through it all we <br/>\nhave determined that she is sensitive to artificial color, artificial <br/>\nflavor, BHT, TBHQ, and nitrates.  We have eliminated all of these <br/>\nthings from her diet and she is a different person, she is 10 now.  <br/>\nIt was very difficult for her when she was in ps.

They were so *fierce*<br/>\nthat she even put her hand through her wall in her room..and they would last<br/>\nanywhere from 20 minutes on the short end, to 2 hours on the long end (This<br/>\nwas beginning of summer 2001, I pulled her from public school end of May<br/>\n2001 due to some issues with anxiety which she unfortunately inherited from<br/>\nme, and the fact that well frankly she wasnt doing anything but sitting in<br/>\nthe nurses office every day..and she was making herself sick at home so she<br/>\nwouldnt have to go to school..Didnt take long for me to realize I was doing<br/>\nher NO good by forcing her...and yanked her so fast I think the school&#39;s<br/>\nhead spun :&gt;...) Anyhow, back to the point of this post...I did a lot of<br/>\nresearch on conduct disorders, rage issues and the like...She was in therapy<br/>\nwith a wonderful therapist that used music therapy with kids (and had been<br/>\nso I knew that wasnt changing her raging, even though it was helping<br/>\nimmensely with her self esteem and the like)..Anyhow, it really helped her<br/>\nto work out her feelings..One of the things I happened upon in my research<br/>\nwas red dye 40.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now realize; our family is not one who eats organically all the time, back<br/>\nthen it was never organic..now I am more mindful of how we eat but we&#39;re<br/>\nstill not out of the processed food ....BUT I did eliminate red dye 40 from<br/>\nher diet completely..because I saw that almost *everything* she ate had it<br/>\nin it...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It took about 2 weeks but the rages stopped. Completely. She has only<br/>\n&#39;raged&#39; once since we eliminated RD40; and that was after eating a red jello<br/>\nsalad at a church function :|...She is very aware of her sensitivity to the<br/>\ndye and for the most part checks on her own to make sure what she is<br/>\nbuying/wanting/eating doesnt have it in it..She is now a completely<br/>\ndifferent child, she is much less volatile, even when we dont agree with<br/>\neach other, or she&#39;s unable to do something she wants right then (which used<br/>\nto be a huge trigger, when I&#39;d say her friend couldnt stay the night due to<br/>\nour schedule the next day etc, a rage would ensue..) she is much more able<br/>\nto talk to and reason with..It just amazes me that the crap is still legal<br/>\n(RD40 is a petroleum based product..)..But it may be something that you want<br/>\nto look at if you are looking for possible food sensitivities being the<br/>\nreason for behavioral issues.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;ramble off&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nichoel<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fertility Friend Online Support Guide<br/>\n&gt; Now you CAN conceive online..<br/>\n&gt; www.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: debbie jones<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 10:39 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Milk and milk products<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Kolleen,<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks for all the great tips. I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I<br/>\never had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried<br/>\nsoy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were<br/>\ndrinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for<br/>\nlack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has. My son<br/>\nused to eat sherbet but really doesn&#39;t want that either. Just fatty ol ice<br/>\ncream. I&#39;m trying out other things just to keep him from feeling too<br/>\ndeprived. If he won&#39;t try them, fine.<br/>\n&gt;   The things we do for our kids.... : )<br/>\n&gt;   What I am really trying to figure out is why there are so many kids<br/>\ndiagnosed with ADHD anymore. What has changed in our society to bring this<br/>\non? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not<br/>\nhave the solution to the problem years ago? Too much medicating whatever<br/>\nails us seems to be a contributing issue.<br/>\n&gt;   Ok, well, I&#39;m getting off topic I suppose.<br/>\n&gt;   Debbie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt; Since I&#39;m just starting my path<br/>\ndown the food sensitivity route, and<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;believe milk and milk products are causing a large problem of ADD<br/>\nsymptoms<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;to my son, what would you recommend to use as substitutes for milk, ice<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;cream, cheese in macaroni and cheese, etc? My son is feeling very<br/>\ndeprived<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy),<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is<br/>\nprobably<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping.

And as I<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt;   beleive it to be so, I can&#39;t think of anything as *comforting* than a<br/>\n&gt;   host of foods with milk products. Yet, cows milk is best digested by<br/>\nbaby<br/>\n&gt;   cows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Personally, I&#39;d rather have the real thing (yeah, my upbringing brought<br/>\n&gt;   this on) than have a substitute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather<br/>\n&gt;   than introduce another substitute?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when<br/>\n&gt;   butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my<br/>\n&gt;   bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my<br/>\n&gt;   choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found<br/>\n&gt;   repulsive.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt;   great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made<br/>\n&gt;   cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic<br/>\n&gt;   shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?)<br/>\n&gt;   bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of<br/>\n&gt;   butter).

I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses<br/>\n&gt;   but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a<br/>\n&gt;   milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know<br/>\n&gt;   your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Debbie, good luck with the elimination.

We call her rage behavior &quot;fits&quot;.  They started when she was 5.  At first they were very infrequent say once a month, then became more and more frequent until they were every few hours.  I knew something was wrong and talked to the pediatrician.  He recommended a therapist.  The guy was awful.  First he said it was my fault then he tried to pin the ADD label and some sort of defiant disorder thing on her but he said thad didn&#39;t really fit because she knew she had a problem with her temper and wanted some help.  Well he was no help at all.  As it turned out, my daughter was the one that actually figured it out.  I was giving her some Triaminic medicine to try to relieve her very stuffy nose.  Before a dose, she said to me, &quot;I know how that stuff works, I take it, have a fit which makes me cry a lot and then my nose runs&quot;.  I called the Dr. and asked if the yellow dye in the medicine could give my daughter behavior problems.  He said it was unlikely that it was the dye but it could have been the active ingredient that made her a little anxious.  I told him I had noticed behavior problems with her shortly after she at a blue snow cone once.  He said that a Dr. Feingold developed a program for children with behavior problems related to food additives.  The reason he did not mention it earlier was because it has not been clinically proven.  Through it all we have determined that she is sensitive to artificial color, artificial flavor, BHT, TBHQ, and nitrates.  We have eliminated all of these things from her diet and she is a different person, she is 10 now.  It was very difficult for her when she was in ps.  They offer candy as a reward for many things.  She has developed a tremendous amount of self-control regarding her food choices.  The hardest time of year is Halloween.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  One more thing, she gets leg aches and wets her bed if there is something in her food that we didn&#39;t catch - never fails.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pat<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Nichoel <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 1:48 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Food sensitivites/dyes..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the subject of food sensitivities:<br/>\n  My daughter (9 years old now) used to do what I call &#39;raging&#39;..From the time she was 2 she would have these horrendous fits; at least once, most of the time more times a day..When she was 2 I attributed it to her age and lack of ability to communicate fully her needs....As she got older I attributed it to having two different sets of rules between her dad and myself..but then her dad passed on..So I attributed it to my unavailability as a parent (At this point she is ooh about 5 and I am working in corporate America; so we are seeing each other less than 4 hours a day..)..<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then when she was 6, I became a SAHM...the rages did not decrease in velocity or in number even after 2 years of a very stable and loving environment..(She was still in PS at this point..)

Completely. She has only &#39;raged&#39; once since we eliminated RD40; and that was after eating a red jello salad at a church function :|...She is very aware of her sensitivity to the dye and for the most part checks on her own to make sure what she is buying/wanting/eating doesnt have it in it..She is now a completely different child, she is much less volatile, even when we dont agree with each other, or she&#39;s unable to do something she wants right then (which used to be a huge trigger, when I&#39;d say her friend couldnt stay the night due to our schedule the next day etc, a rage would ensue..) she is much more able to talk to and reason with..It just amazes me that the crap is still legal (RD40 is a petroleum based product..)..But it may be something that you want to look at if you are looking for possible food sensitivities being the reason for behavioral issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;ramble off&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nichoel<br/>\n<br/>\n  Fertility Friend Online Support Guide <br/>\n  Now you CAN conceive online..<br/>\n  www.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: debbie jones <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 10:39 AM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Milk and milk products<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Kolleen,<br/>\n    Thanks for all the great tips. I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I ever had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried soy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were drinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for lack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has. My son used to eat sherbet but really doesn&#39;t want that either. Just fatty ol ice cream. I&#39;m trying out other things just to keep him from feeling too deprived. If he won&#39;t try them, fine.<br/>\n    The things we do for our kids.... : )<br/>\n    What I am really trying to figure out is why there are so many kids diagnosed with ADHD anymore. What has changed in our society to bring this on? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not have the solution to the problem years ago? Too much medicating whatever ails us seems to be a contributing issue.<br/>\n    Ok, well, I&#39;m getting off topic I suppose.<br/>\n    Debbie  <br/>\n<br/>\n      Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt; Since I&#39;m just starting my path down the food sensitivity route, and <br/>\n    &gt;believe milk and milk products are causing a large problem of ADD symptoms <br/>\n    &gt;to my son, what would you recommend to use as substitutes for milk, ice <br/>\n    &gt;cream, cheese in macaroni and cheese, etc? My son is feeling very deprived <br/>\n    &gt;right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby to <br/>\n    &gt;over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy), <br/>\n    &gt;thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I have <br/>\n    &gt;since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is probably <br/>\n    &gt;it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at what <br/>\n    &gt;point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping. I haven&#39;t given him the <br/>\n    &gt;Adderall in the last week and wonder if I can give him the medication and <br/>\n    &gt;still do an elimination diet at the same time?<br/>\n    &gt;Debbie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I remember hearing once that cows milk is best for baby cows. And as I do <br/>\n    beleive it to be so, I can&#39;t think of anything as *comforting* than a <br/>\n    host of foods with milk products. Yet, cows milk is best digested by baby <br/>\n    cows.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Personally, I&#39;d rather have the real thing (yeah, my upbringing brought <br/>\n    this on) than have a substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\n    So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather <br/>\n    than introduce another substitute?<br/>\n<br/>\n    For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when <br/>\n    butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my <br/>\n    bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my <br/>\n    choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found <br/>\n    repulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n    When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that was <br/>\n    great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made <br/>\n    cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic <br/>\n    shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?) <br/>\n    bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of <br/>\n    butter). They turned out great (hint, use 1/2 expresso chips and 1/2 <br/>\n    semi-sweet chips, follow *almost* the entire Nestle Tollhouse recipe, use <br/>\n    organic ingredients. The sugar was dehydrated cane and I just added some <br/>\n    molasses to make up for the lack of organic brown sugar)<br/>\n<br/>\n    The cheese part is a tough one. I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses <br/>\n    but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a <br/>\n    milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know <br/>\n    your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Debbie, good luck with the elimination. I know its a hard road to climb <br/>\n    since it takes a lot of time and energy to keep track of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Let us know how you fare!<br/>\n<br/>\n    regards,<br/>\n    kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Yahoo!

She has only &#39;raged&#39; once since we eliminated RD40; and that was after eating a red jello salad at a church function :|...She is very aware of her sensitivity to the dye and for the most part checks on her own to make sure what she is buying/wanting/eating doesnt have it in it..She is now a completely different child, she is much less volatile, even when we dont agree with each other, or she&#39;s unable to do something she wants right then (which used to be a huge trigger, when I&#39;d say her friend couldnt stay the night due to our schedule the next day etc, a rage would ensue..) she is much more able to talk to and reason with..It just amazes me that the crap is still legal (RD40 is a petroleum based product..)..But it may be something that you want to look at if you are looking for possible food sensitivities being the reason for behavioral issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;ramble off&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNichoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFertility Friend Online Support Guide <br/>\nNow you CAN conceive online..<br/>\nwww.fertilityfriend.com/sm/21749/<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: debbie jones <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 10:39 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Milk and milk products<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kolleen,<br/>\n  Thanks for all the great tips. I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I ever had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried soy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were drinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for lack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has. My son used to eat sherbet but really doesn&#39;t want that either. Just fatty ol ice cream. I&#39;m trying out other things just to keep him from feeling too deprived. If he won&#39;t try them, fine.<br/>\n  The things we do for our kids.... : )<br/>\n  What I am really trying to figure out is why there are so many kids diagnosed with ADHD anymore. What has changed in our society to bring this on? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not have the solution to the problem years ago? Too much medicating whatever ails us seems to be a contributing issue.<br/>\n  Ok, well, I&#39;m getting off topic I suppose.<br/>\n  Debbie  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt; Since I&#39;m just starting my path down the food sensitivity route, and <br/>\n  &gt;believe milk and milk products are causing a large problem of ADD symptoms <br/>\n  &gt;to my son, what would you recommend to use as substitutes for milk, ice <br/>\n  &gt;cream, cheese in macaroni and cheese, etc? My son is feeling very deprived <br/>\n  &gt;right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby to <br/>\n  &gt;over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy), <br/>\n  &gt;thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I have <br/>\n  &gt;since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is probably <br/>\n  &gt;it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at what <br/>\n  &gt;point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping. I haven&#39;t given him the <br/>\n  &gt;Adderall in the last week and wonder if I can give him the medication and <br/>\n  &gt;still do an elimination diet at the same time?<br/>\n  &gt;Debbie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remember hearing once that cows milk is best for baby cows. And as I do <br/>\n  beleive it to be so, I can&#39;t think of anything as *comforting* than a <br/>\n  host of foods with milk products. Yet, cows milk is best digested by baby <br/>\n  cows.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I&#39;d rather have the real thing (yeah, my upbringing brought <br/>\n  this on) than have a substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather <br/>\n  than introduce another substitute?<br/>\n<br/>\n  For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when <br/>\n  butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my <br/>\n  bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my <br/>\n  choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found <br/>\n  repulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that was <br/>\n  great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made <br/>\n  cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic <br/>\n  shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?) <br/>\n  bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of <br/>\n  butter). They turned out great (hint, use 1/2 expresso chips and 1/2 <br/>\n  semi-sweet chips, follow *almost* the entire Nestle Tollhouse recipe, use <br/>\n  organic ingredients. The sugar was dehydrated cane and I just added some <br/>\n  molasses to make up for the lack of organic brown sugar)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The cheese part is a tough one. I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses <br/>\n  but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a <br/>\n  milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know <br/>\n  your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Debbie, good luck with the elimination. I know its a hard road to climb <br/>\n  since it takes a lot of time and energy to keep track of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Let us know how you fare!<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!

They started when she was 5.  At first they were very infrequent say once a month, then became more and more frequent until they were every few hours.  I knew something was wrong and talked to the pediatrician.  He recommended a therapist.  The guy was awful.  First he said it was my fault then he tried to pin the ADD label and some sort of defiant disorder thing on her but he said thad didn&#39;t really fit because she knew she had a problem with her temper and wanted some help.  Well he was no help at all.  As it turned out, my daughter was the one that actually figured it out.  I was giving her some Triaminic medicine to try to relieve her very stuffy nose.  Before a dose, she said to me, &quot;I know how that stuff works, I take it, have a fit which makes me cry a lot and then my nose runs&quot;.  I called the Dr. and asked if the yellow dye in the medicine could give my daughter behavior problems.  He said it was unlikely that it was the dye but it could have been the active ingredient that made her a little anxious.  I told him I had noticed behavior problems with her shortly after she at a blue snow cone once.  He said that a Dr. Feingold developed a program for children with behavior problems related to food additives.  The reason he did not mention it earlier was because it has not been clinically proven.  Through it all we have determined that she is sensitive to artificial color, artificial flavor, BHT, TBHQ, and nitrates.  We have eliminated all of these things from her diet and she is a different person, she is 10 now.  It was very difficult for her when she was in ps.  They offer candy as a reward for many things.  She has developed a tremendous amount of self-control regarding her food choices.  The hardest time of year is Halloween.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, she gets leg aches and wets her bed if there is something in her food that we didn&#39;t catch - never fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Nichoel <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, January 02, 2002 1:48 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Food sensitivites/dyes..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of food sensitivities:<br/>\nMy daughter (9 years old now) used to do what I call &#39;raging&#39;..From the time she was 2 she would have these horrendous fits; at least once, most of the time more times a day..When she was 2 I attributed it to her age and lack of ability to communicate fully her needs....As she got older I attributed it to having two different sets of rules between her dad and myself..but then her dad passed on..So I attributed it to my unavailability as a parent (At this point she is ooh about 5 and I am working in corporate America; so we are seeing each other less than 4 hours a day..)..<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when she was 6, I became a SAHM...the rages did not decrease in velocity or in number even after 2 years of a very stable and loving environment..(She was still in PS at this point..)

Anyhow, back to the point of this post...I did a lot of research on conduct disorders, rage issues and the like...She was in therapy with a wonderful therapist that used music therapy with kids (and had been so I knew that wasnt changing her raging, even though it was helping immensely with her self esteem and the like)..Anyhow, it really helped her to work out her feelings..One of the things I happened upon in my research was red dye 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow realize; our family is not one who eats organically all the time, back then it was never organic..now I am more mindful of how we eat but we&#39;re still not out of the processed food ....BUT I did eliminate red dye 40 from her diet completely..because I saw that almost *everything* she ate had it in it...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took about 2 weeks but the rages stopped.

I&#39;m taking note of them. I don&#39;t think I ever had trouble with dairy foods, but in the last few years I have tried soy milk and now that is all I drink. Regular (skim) milk that we were drinking is now not appealing to me. Soy just seems so much &quot;cleaner&quot; (for lack of a better term). No filmy consistency that regular milk has. My son used to eat sherbet but really doesn&#39;t want that either. Just fatty ol ice cream. I&#39;m trying out other things just to keep him from feeling too deprived. If he won&#39;t try them, fine.<br/>\n  The things we do for our kids.... : )<br/>\n  What I am really trying to figure out is why there are so many kids diagnosed with ADHD anymore. What has changed in our society to bring this on? Worse eating habits? Environmental toxins? I don&#39;t know. Did we just not have the solution to the problem years ago? Too much medicating whatever ails us seems to be a contributing issue.<br/>\n  Ok, well, I&#39;m getting off topic I suppose.<br/>\n  Debbie  <br/>\n<br/>\n    Kolleen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kolleen@...\">Kolleen@...</a>&gt; wrote: &gt; Since I&#39;m just starting my path down the food sensitivity route, and <br/>\n  &gt;believe milk and milk products are causing a large problem of ADD symptoms <br/>\n  &gt;to my son, what would you recommend to use as substitutes for milk, ice <br/>\n  &gt;cream, cheese in macaroni and cheese, etc? My son is feeling very deprived <br/>\n  &gt;right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby to <br/>\n  &gt;over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy), <br/>\n  &gt;thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I have <br/>\n  &gt;since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is probably <br/>\n  &gt;it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at what <br/>\n  &gt;point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping. I haven&#39;t given him the <br/>\n  &gt;Adderall in the last week and wonder if I can give him the medication and <br/>\n  &gt;still do an elimination diet at the same time?<br/>\n  &gt;Debbie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I remember hearing once that cows milk is best for baby cows. And as I do <br/>\n  beleive it to be so, I can&#39;t think of anything as *comforting* than a <br/>\n  host of foods with milk products. Yet, cows milk is best digested by baby <br/>\n  cows.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Personally, I&#39;d rather have the real thing (yeah, my upbringing brought <br/>\n  this on) than have a substitute.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So as part of your elimination, maybe you could opt to do without rather <br/>\n  than introduce another substitute?<br/>\n<br/>\n  For example, as kids we were gluttons for bread with butter. So when <br/>\n  butter was obviously not a great choice as an adult, I try to dip my <br/>\n  bread in olive oil (flavoured at times) when I have bread. It was my <br/>\n  choice as opposed to going to some form of soy butter which _I_ found <br/>\n  repulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the kid was young, he went from breastmilk to rice milk and that was <br/>\n  great. Its sweet and its not dairy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tropical Source makes some great dairy free chocolate chips. I just made <br/>\n  cookies with them last night, and instead of butter, we used organic <br/>\n  shortening. (As a side note, this was not by choice, guything (dg?) <br/>\n  bought the chips at WholeFoods, he grabbed dairy-free, and I ran out of <br/>\n  butter). They turned out great (hint, use 1/2 expresso chips and 1/2 <br/>\n  semi-sweet chips, follow *almost* the entire Nestle Tollhouse recipe, use <br/>\n  organic ingredients. The sugar was dehydrated cane and I just added some <br/>\n  molasses to make up for the lack of organic brown sugar)<br/>\n<br/>\n  The cheese part is a tough one. I haven&#39;t tried any of the soy cheeses <br/>\n  but I know they exist. Although you may not want to introduce soy as a <br/>\n  milk substitute until after you&#39;ve eliminated milk long enough to know <br/>\n  your not replacing one *reaction* with another.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Debbie, good luck with the elimination. I know its a hard road to climb <br/>\n  since it takes a lot of time and energy to keep track of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Let us know how you fare!<br/>\n<br/>\n  regards,<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!
