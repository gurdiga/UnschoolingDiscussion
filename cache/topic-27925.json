For<br/>\nyears I tried many non-medical ways to counter this condition (when I<br/>\nfinally realized what I was suffering from).  Excercise (until recently,<br/>\nI was always very athletic and active), diet (years of being on a vegan<br/>\nand then a macrobiotic diet, etc.).  I tried many different things.  I<br/>\nfinally resorted to medication.  Prozac was my answer.  It has made a<br/>\ntremendous difference in my life.  I swear by it.  It is right for me.<br/>\nI wish I had found it many years before I finally did.  Obviously, I<br/>\nmake no secret of my need for this medication.  I&#39;m not embarrassed by<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, people start questioning me about, &quot;well did you try changing<br/>\nyour diet?  Or, do you excercise, etc.?&quot;  I have recently found myself<br/>\nresenting the fact I have to go through my whole history (which is very<br/>\nextensive - there are many factors invloved, which goes back 3<br/>\ngenerations) to explain why I have found that I need to medicate<br/>\nmyself.  Maybe I&#39;m just too sensitive.  After all, aren&#39;t these people<br/>\njust trying to help me?  People need to realize how different we all are<br/>\nand respect their choices just as I try to respect my childrens&#39;<br/>\nchoices, which I think is a big factor in unschooling.

If you have no experience<br/>\nwith that, then I am happy for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK-&quot;&lt;&lt;Is<br/>\nalcoholism just a habit?

I bought cheap bourbon<br/>\nyesterday to make a <br/>\nfruit <br/>\ncake.  I had a margarita last month.  No addictions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Again I am glad that these items are not addictions<br/>\nfor you personally. For many people they are a real<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;Beans and tortillas are super-common here.

Again I am glad they are not a problem for<br/>\nyou personally.   <br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;All humans eat some kind of bread.  Have we been<br/>\nbread addicts for a <br/>\nthousands of years?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK- Maybe many of us are. Breads are commonly referred<br/>\nto as &quot;comfort foods&quot;, mood altering, calming, and<br/>\nsoothing. Personally wheat makes me feel drugged, but<br/>\nI don&#39;t even notice it until I avoided it for quite a<br/>\nlong time. Trying it again was like being high. There<br/>\nare many other life sustaining grains out there. Why<br/>\nis wheat so important? Maybe it is a calming food. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because something has always been done or is<br/>\n&quot;just the way things are&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that it will be<br/>\nhealthy for everyone. It just makes it harder for<br/>\nanyone to believe there could be any problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmoking is an example of something that has been done<br/>\nfor thousands of years. Anyone who said it was<br/>\naddictive or unhealthy would have been laughed at. Yet<br/>\nnow the popular scientific opinion has changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS-&quot;Maybe addiction is too strong a word to use for<br/>\nevery single thing <br/>\npeople <br/>\nlike and need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nK-Of course it is too strong a word for every single<br/>\nthing people like or need. I did not use it that way.<br/>\nI used it to describe certain foods that some people<br/>\ncrave and keep eating, even though that food makes<br/>\nthem ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not claiming that everyone is in denial if they<br/>\nthink they have no food allergies. I think that lack<br/>\nof personal experience with it doesn&#39;t make it true or<br/>\nfalse. I expect everyone will do their own experiments<br/>\nand research, and see for themselves whether or not it<br/>\nis true for them. Many people I know have been<br/>\nsurprised.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am proposing this idea as an open question to anyone<br/>\nwho may have (or be caring for someone who has)<br/>\nchronic health problems like obesity, exhaustion,<br/>\ninability to concentrate, asthma, digestive troubles<br/>\nand basically anything that really bothers you that<br/>\nyou have no other known cause for. I am asking you to<br/>\nask your own questions about the relationship of what<br/>\nyou eat to how you feel.
