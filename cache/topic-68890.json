I really like polyergic - dh uses it as<br/>\nhis business name (Polyergic Consulting), got it from one of our kids<br/>\nwho used it for things, including his email.  Many dictionaries don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the word, but it basically means able to act (capable of acting) in<br/>\nmany different ways.  So guess I&#39;d use that if we needed a school name.<br/>\nUm.  Polyergic...?  Polyergic Academy?  Center for Polyergic Life?<br/>\nSomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68872,"nextTopicId":68893}}
