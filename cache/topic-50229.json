I explained to her that when we go to the zoo or to <br/>\nthe tidepools at the beach or when we read together...we are still <br/>\nlearning and that is real school.  I also explain to her that the <br/>\nworkbooks are still on the shelf if she ever wants to work in them <br/>\nand I can help if she needs it.  I feel bad though...but I want her <br/>\nto become comfortable with unschooling and not feel like she needs <br/>\nworksheets...she hasn&#39;t even been in much traditional school.  My 8 <br/>\nyr old on the other hand is now at the opposite corner.  No reading, <br/>\nno writing, no math at all!!!  Of course baking cookies is okay :) <br/>\nAnd playing the game with coins where you have to trade them in for <br/>\nlarger coins until you get to a quarter and then you get to keep the <br/>\nquarter!  That is okay too :) And we just got the placemats...they <br/>\nlove them.  I just let them look through them all and discuss with <br/>\nthem what they want.  My son is fascinated with maps...any time he <br/>\nsees one it stops him dead in his tracks and he is always making his <br/>\nown...I find that intriguing.  <br/>\nMichelle B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50171,"nextTopicId":50243}}
