Occasionally the food comes and we look at each other<br/>\nand whisper, &quot;What IS that?&quot; and giggle.  Sometimes he&#39;ll take the first<br/>\ntaste and tell me, &quot;You can try it if you want to, but it&#39;s awful.&quot;  I<br/>\nalmost always do try it.  Sometimes it is awful!<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we were at an International festival in Frankfurt and decided to try<br/>\nout the Egyptian food booth.  We got the sampler plate, and several things<br/>\nwe both poked at a bit before summoning the courage to try them.  I liked<br/>\nmost of it, but I definitely need to bring peanut butter to Egypt for Tim if<br/>\nwe ever go there!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73132,"nextTopicId":73282}}
