For those who haven&#39;t and who read it as nasty, <br/>\nall I can guess is that they&#39;ve put THEIR voice and intent and inflections on <br/>\nit.    Or something, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly got a letter from her uncle last week, Keith&#39;s oldest brother.   He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t write as he speaks at all, whatsoever.   He doesn&#39;t write as ANY human <br/>\nspeaks, but he writes as his mom writes letters.  It&#39;s like a whole different <br/>\nlanguage.   One of my best friends years ago was an English major, as was I (but <br/>\nhe ended up being rich from his hobby, which was computers in the 70&#39;s...) <br/>\nand he wrote well, but it was always very stilted.   He had a whole different <br/>\nvocabulary and &quot;voice&quot; when he wrote.    So it was pretty good reading but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;sound like him.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what it is about Keith&#39;s mom and brother.   It&#39;s a combination <br/>\nof stilted language and platitude that grates on me.   It&#39;s polite on the <br/>\nsurface, but the irritation is in &quot;WHY is this being written, and why not just use <br/>\nregular, living English?!&quot;   Still, I&#39;m glad to get the letters, and the <br/>\nletter to Holly was a full page typed, and she&#39;ll read it a few more times as she <br/>\ngets older, and that will be cool I&#39;m sure.   Sample, though (and it&#39;s all <br/>\nabout her trip to Europe):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Your experiences are really quite unique and I am sure that you will <br/>\ntreasure the memories of 2005 forever.   It has been several years since my last trip <br/>\nto Europe (Fall 1984-Italy), but the experience not only of that trip but of <br/>\nthe other previous trips or vacation to the continent will last a lifetime.   <br/>\nI was not as fortunate as you as to have a friend to be my tour guide and I am <br/>\nsure that you have been able to see and do things that are most unique.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was an officer in the Navy and so most of his trips were duty-related, I <br/>\nthink.   The sentiments are nice, but the writing seems unnatural to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other extreme, though, I guess, it the language of instant messages and <br/>\ntext messaging.   Maybe someone has a teen who could translate the paragraph <br/>\nabove down to its barest form.   I guess it would start &quot;coo&quot; and be about over <br/>\nby then. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] spelling, stalking and writing","postDate":"1119718500","msgId":106981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmZTkzYzRkMGM2YmM5NmE4NTIxN2ZjYzY0YTU4OWM2QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjI1MDY0NTU4LjUxMzcucW1haWxAd2ViNTE4MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjI1MDY0NTU4LjUxMzcucW1haWxAd2ViNTE4MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106980,"nextInTopic":106982,"prevInTime":106980,"nextInTime":106982,"topicId":106975,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know the point was more to show <br/>\nHolly&#39;s writing, but what I loved so much was how patient and wonderful <br/>\nyou are to your children. This to me was a PERFECT example of how <br/>\nunschooling should work. It is parental involvement -- taking time with <br/>\nthem -- to answer their questions -- to be there for them. **<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a point worth underlining.  Having seen Sandra interact with Holly (look I have one data point and I&#39;m making a theory out of it!), I would say that sweet is an excellent word to describe it.   People who&#39;ve only seen her logical side in online conversation may not be able to imagine how consistent this is in her parenting.  (Even if you HAVE heard the plum shopping story.)  And Sandra has a musical voice which also sweetens everything she says, but it completely washes out in online text, unless you imagine it back in.  This medium has big limitations!  As a perpetual comedian, it really bothers me that I can&#39;t put the proper comic timing and inflection in my comments.  Nor can I smile winsomely. ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, back to the topic...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my mothering style has picked up too much sitcom mom sarcasm, even if it is flung around with a gentle hand.  Sometimes I notice that I treat my husband and my friends much as I learned to treat my brother growing up (and my male dorm mates), with a consistent style of poke-in-the-ribs putdown humor.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever mean-spirited or hostile, but I do seem to be irreverant (and loopy) almost all of the time.  (Wait -- I guess I am mean about politicians that I don&#39;t like.  Not as fierce as Molly Ivins, but about as much as Jon Stewart, my hero, and aparently my role model.)  (Wait!  I don&#39;t make sex jokes about my kid (ick) like he does.)  For the record, most of my jokes are about me, with me being the butt of the humor.  The rest of my snarky remarks appear to be well received.  No one, no one in my family anyway, is bursting into tears or shunning me or (apparently) smoldering with resentment.  (If someone else made you feel that way, please don&#39;t imagine that I look and act just like them.  Humor should never be used for evil.  Really, I took a pledge. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone earnest on TV any more?  Sweet?  I&#39;ve been rereading Anne of Green Gables (to myself) and she was VERY sweet, abut that was a hundred years ago!  I&#39;ve been reading A Series of Unfortunate Events to my son -- and a MORE sour and bitter book for children would be hard to imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nCulturally, we don&#39;t have many role models for sweetness.  I guess sweetness doesn&#39;t &quot;get the ratings&quot; needed to stay on the TV airwaves.  We live in a pretty cynical, irreverant era.  Certainly sweetness doesn&#39;t live long on the school playground.  The other kids sense weakness and attack it.  When we are adults people around us can be quick to tell us if they think we are too sweet, too kind and too accomodating with our children, especially if our kids are getting sweet things that they never, ever had.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  I suppose Spongebob himself is pretty sweet for a contemporary cartoon character.  But he doesn&#39;t live in a sweet world.

I&#39;ve always tried to add one more bit, one connection, <br/>\nor one contrast, and not consciously, like a little terminator pulldown menu, <br/>\nbut just to throw in one piece of bonus info.   Then sometimes the <br/>\nconversation continues a bit, as it did with Holly in that IM, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t, <br/>\nand that&#39;s cool.   Sometimes it goes on and ON, and picks up the next day, and <br/>\nthat can be pretty fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith words and spelling, I&#39;ve tried to name another related word, or if I <br/>\nknow the reason for a spelling oddity, I usually say so, briefly.    Holly has <br/>\nfor a couple of months been using the phrase &quot;as opposed to,&quot; but earlier in the <br/>\nspring she would say &quot;opposed to,&quot; and I corrected her and said the phrase is <br/>\n&quot;as opposed to,&quot; so she got it right and uses it lots.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had left me an e-mail about a typo on the webpage about her England trip, <br/>\nand used it but had never written it or seen it written, so she wrote &quot;as <br/>\naposed to,&quot; and I wrote back that I&#39;d fixed the typo, and that it was spelled <br/>\n&quot;opposed&quot; as in &quot;opposite&quot; and &quot;opposition,&quot; but I didn&#39;t know exactly what the <br/>\n&quot;op&quot; meant.   I didn&#39;t look it up right then, but either Holly will or I will <br/>\nsometime, probably.   Or not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd night before last she said &quot;thrice&quot; about something, and asked if thrice <br/>\nwas really a word, and I said yes, like twice.   We talked about there not <br/>\nbeing one for &quot;four times,&quot; and that of the series once, twice, thrice, north <br/>\nAmericans only really use the first two anymore.      We talked about &quot;twins&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;twilight,&quot; both very old English words, and the t-w-o spelling of &quot;two,&quot; <br/>\nwhich   used to be pronounced (and spelled, sometimes) &quot;twa.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier not to be cranky that &quot;two&quot; is spelled that way if you think of <br/>\ntwins at twilight twice.   &quot;Twilight&quot; is two lights, half-and-half day and <br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to be cranky about &quot;to&quot; &quot;too&quot; and &quot;two&quot; until you remember it&#39;s <br/>\ncool that we don&#39;t have to wonder which one it is when we&#39;re reading, and in <br/>\ncontext you can tell.   It&#39;s only in the unnatural arena of school&#39;s spelling <br/>\ntests and all that it gets so confusing.   In the natural world it&#39;s not so hard <br/>\nto learn the differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":188356966,"authorName":"Brandie","from":"Brandie &lt;scrapdiva73@...&gt;","profile":"scrapdiva73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] spelling, stalking and writing","postDate":"1119681958","msgId":106978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjI1MDY0NTU4LjUxMzcucW1haWxAd2ViNTE4MDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFlOS4zZWFkOTRkOC4yZmVkYzM3MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106976,"nextInTopic":106979,"prevInTime":106977,"nextInTime":106979,"topicId":106975,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I totally loved reading that.

I know the point was more to show Holly&#39;s writing, but what I loved so much was how patient and wonderful you are to your children.  This to me was a PERFECT example of how unschooling should work.  It is parental involvement -- taking time with them -- to answer their questions -- to be there for them.  This one little message showed all of that.  So many parents will say they do this, but don&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow involved a prent must be to successfully unschool is big on my mind right now as someone on a local homeschooling list seems to think that unschooling means that we as parents don&#39;t do anything.
