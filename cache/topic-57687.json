You","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2114899963\">Hey<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a decade ago, or a little less, I did a &quot;word study&quot; on the <br/>\nwords &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn,&quot; to see what the Bible has to say about <br/>\nthose concepts. You define your words (dictionary) and you find <br/>\nusages of your word in the Bible (concordance) and then you write an <br/>\nessay about what you found. It&#39;s very educational, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I just this morning remembered that word study, and I can&#39;t <br/>\nfind it right now, but I do remember what I found.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) teach has a connotation of piercing. Of an arrow finding the mark. <br/>\nHas anyone on this list ever had that happen? I&#39;d liken it to <br/>\nan &quot;aha&quot; moment on speed! L &quot;wow. This is TRUE. or This is BEAUTIFUL. <br/>\nor This is GOOD.&quot; and it sets your heart flying, when this happens. <br/>\nIt IS like being pierced, with joy or profundity or deep <br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) there is one passage in the Bible that directly says &quot;teach&quot; about <br/>\nParent to Child. It is in Deuteronomy, and it says <br/>\n(paraphrased) &quot;Teach these things to your children when they rise, <br/>\nwhen you are walking along the way with them, and when they go to <br/>\nsleep.&quot; IOW, throughout the day, be with your kids, teaching them. <br/>\nThe context happens to be about teaching God&#39;s Law to them, but I say <br/>\nit&#39;s about teaching them. Period. This group has mentioned teach by <br/>\nexample/ Well, how, if they aren&#39;t with you every day, for the major <br/>\nportion of their time?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) other mentions of teach deal with a pleading with God, to teach <br/>\nHis statutes directly to the &quot;pleader.&quot; i.e. &quot;teach me thy ways, Oh <br/>\nGod, and I will know them.&quot; and, going to the Creation to learn. <br/>\ni.e. &quot;Go to the ant, thou sluggard...&quot; if you want to learn about <br/>\nworking and being prepared. <br/>\n<br/>\nIndirectly, (not necessarily with the words teach or learn right <br/>\nthere in the passage) you can find examples of eagles, badgers, <br/>\nserpents, locusts, lizards, lions, roosters, male goats, ships at <br/>\nsea, a weaned child, a tree by a river of water, kings, slaves, <br/>\nwomen, men, babies...TEACHING. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the main thing I remember from my word study: that God <br/>\nteaches, and that His creation teaches. Here is where I can take the <br/>\nmain ideas of unschooling (people will pursue knowledge if let to do <br/>\nso) and say &quot;It&#39;s Biblical, for even God himself says to learn from <br/>\nthe creation.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t find any mention in scripture of sittin em down and makin em <br/>\ndo seatwork...but plenty about listening to your father&#39;s instruction <br/>\nand the guidance of the Word in a person&#39;s life, about diligence and <br/>\ndoing good, about working vs. being lazy...hmmm, about DOING?<br/>\n<br/>\nanyways. Just some thoughts this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace, Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57689,"nextTopicId":57686}}
