The environment might be lacking.<br/>\n&gt;The parent might not know how to interact with the child, for instance an<br/>\n&gt;adult who was bookish might be less inclined to give her kinesthetic child<br/>\n&gt;the freedom to use his body as much as he needs, not being able to perceive<br/>\n&gt;that as learning. Child led is only a part of the picture.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But if we define unschooling as how children *naturally* learn then we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;say unschooling won&#39;t work because it&#39;s the same as saying children can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think one of the stumbling blocks with unschooling and learning<br/>\n&gt;disabilities is that there isn&#39;t a large enough community of unschoolers of<br/>\n&gt;LD kids. All the research is oriented towards kids who are expected to learn<br/>\n&gt;what is taught in school, with the goal of hopefully getting them into<br/>\n&gt;school. The research supports that being taught through particular methods<br/>\n&gt;is what various LD kids need.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But does that research apply to helping LD kids learn naturally? Helping<br/>\n&gt;them become themselves rather than products to be fed to colleges or the<br/>\n&gt;workforce?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If we begin with the premise that kids don&#39;t need taught then the quest is<br/>\n&gt;to find ways to help kids learn what they want to learn, not learn what we<br/>\n&gt;think they should learn in the time we think they should learn it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For instance there are ways of helping dyslexic people read. But if those<br/>\n&gt;ways involve coercion, regardless of how authoritative someone is, then<br/>\n&gt;perhaps it&#39;s a good idea to look at the goals they are imposing on the<br/>\n&gt;dyslexic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I copied the whole damn thing again.
