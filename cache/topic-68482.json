Right, where DO you look for accurate information??<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your little ones are concerned...you have enough time to relax and <br/>\nwatch them learn so unschooling will just be a natural extension of that <br/>\nobservation and exploration.  It really is that simple!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your baby girl doing these days?  Learning how to stand, walk, talk? <br/>\n  Are you teaching her how to do those things?  If you hear a yes in your <br/>\nhead or catch it bobbling to and fro, then I ask, are you using a book or <br/>\ncurriculum to do it?  I imagine you sit by nervously as she attempts her <br/>\nfirst steps, allowing her to tumble and get back up on her feet again.  Then <br/>\nthe big moment comes and she ventures out on her own two wobbly feet.  <br/>\nSometimes, you hold her little cherubic hand and guide her along, praising <br/>\nher and loving her and others, you stand a few feet away so she can come to <br/>\nyou on her own.  This is what unschooling feels like.  Offering them the <br/>\nfreedom to explore, experiment, observe and absorb whilst you sit on the <br/>\nsidelines, sometimes cheering, sometimes calming your butterflies, other <br/>\ntimes offering a supportive hand.  Understanding it all in the beginning can <br/>\nbe complicated.  Allowing it to happen and watching your children blossom <br/>\nand grow isn&#39;t!
