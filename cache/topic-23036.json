You can opt out of<br/>\nvaccinations <br/>\nfor religious, medical, and philosophical reasons in most states,<br/>\nalthough <br/>\nsome states only allow one or two of those three. Of course, they don&#39;t<br/>\nlike <br/>\nyou to know that you have that right, because then you might exercise<br/>\nyour <br/>\nfreedom to do so. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two youngest children have only had one vaccine injection (tetenus),<br/>\nand I know about the exemptions for PS and such.... but does anyone have<br/>\nany info on organizations such as the YMCA?  We live in Washington state,<br/>\nby the way.  We recently joined the Y and I&#39;d like to let my 2 & 4 year<br/>\nolds go to the daycare occasionally so I can swim alone but on the<br/>\nadmissions form in BOLD letters it states that any child without<br/>\nup-to-date vaccines will not, under any circumstances, be allowed in the<br/>\ndaycare. You have to fill out the vaccine dates and everything.  My<br/>\ndesire to have them in there once a week for an hour or so is not enough<br/>\nincentive for me to launch a full-blown argument with them, but I&#39;m<br/>\ncurious as to what my options are, if any.
