I&#39;m wondering because my 1 year old <br/>\ndaughter who has a brachial plexus injury also has hip dysplasia.  We took <br/>\nher to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon when she was a week old, and he put her <br/>\nin a special harness for 6 weeks.  He said that usually does the trick - but <br/>\nit didn&#39;t in her case.  She&#39;s in another type of brace now - a hard plastic <br/>\none - that she wears to bed at night.  She has a check up with the orthopedic <br/>\ndoctor the end of this month.  Hopefully her hip will look good enough to <br/>\ntake her out of the brace.  I guess I&#39;d just like to know how your hip <br/>\ndysplasia has affected you.  How painful is it?  Do you think there is any <br/>\nconnection between hip dysplasia and low muscle tone?  Does your hip pop <br/>\noften?  Do your other joints click or pop often?  I&#39;d really appreciate any <br/>\ninformation you or anyone else could give me.  Oh, and thank you for the <br/>\nchiropractic information. I&#39;m seriously considering making an appointment for <br/>\nthe baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7991,"nextTopicId":7998}}
