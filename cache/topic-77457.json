It can be rolling <br/>\nyour eyes when he&#39;s doing something you might not approve of. Offering him too <br/>\nmuch too early (I did that---bringing books home and NOT just leave them lying <br/>\naround, but handing them to him.). Suggesting that he do something---anything. <br/>\n Not that you&#39;re doing any of these things. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be really clear on this---and I feel foggy. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK---When a child&#39;s in school and feels that his life is being lived FOR him <br/>\n(the way Cameron felt), he NEEDS almost to have an *absence* of stimulation <br/>\nfor a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the regular posters here, whom I learned so much unschooling from, <br/>\nnever had kids in school---They knew about it early or they pulled them out <br/>\n*very* early. They got it early enough to not have to deschool. I think <br/>\ndeschooling has GOT to be THE hardest thing for a parent to do. It&#39;s not &quot;natural&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a child in private school (which comes with a WHOLE nother set of <br/>\nproblems than public school!!!). Not only was he in school, but the teachers CARED. <br/>\nThat sounds like a good thing &lt;g&gt;, but that meant they were involved in every <br/>\nsingle aspect of his life! Every one! I can see now how that has GOT to be <br/>\nintimidating---back then I thought it was a GOOD thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think that deschooling almost needs a HUGE vacuum.--or what are <br/>\nthose things called that are void of light, sound, movement? The child needs NOT <br/>\nto do anything for a long while. We say to DO all of these really cool <br/>\nthings---go out to eat, buy great art supplies, rent movies and games, play, play, <br/>\nplay. And to an extent, that&#39;s right and good. But the schooled child may need <br/>\nNOTHING for a while. This is really hard when you wnat SO much FOR him. When <br/>\nyou KNOW that unschooling can offer so much. What what he may really NEED is <br/>\nNOTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe NEEDS to find out Who He Is, not who everyone wants or thinks him to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron had NONE of his current interests when he came out of school. They <br/>\nall evolved out of ... of nothing! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finally quit nagging (and it can be the SLIGHTEST thing---remember <br/>\ntweens and teens are VERY sensitive!), Cameron started becoming himself. We went <br/>\nthrough a horrible Goth period &lt;g&gt; when he first started becoming. We&#39;ve dyed <br/>\nhis hair several times. He&#39;s redone his room and plain made over his LIFE! HIS <br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s such a cool person. I hate what I and the private school did to him. But <br/>\nhe has his own life now---and like I said there arent enough hours in the <br/>\nday!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year he hardly participated in the conference---my own son. He spent the <br/>\nwhole weekend in the hotel room! This year he&#39;s very excited about it and is <br/>\nplanning to help a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him time---lots of time. Unlimited time---it will limit itself. And the <br/>\nfreedom to do NOTHING. TELL him this! When he wakes from the school stupor, he <br/>\nwill have found himself and become Who He Is---and he&#39;ll be fascinating. It <br/>\njust takes time----and no nagging! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4335759,"authorName":"HaHaMommy@aol.com","from":"HaHaMommy@...","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] A question about boredom","postDate":"1059019827","msgId":77525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3LjNiZTUwMDQxLjJjNTBiNjMzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77524,"nextInTopic":77531,"prevInTime":77524,"nextInTime":77526,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7-23-2003 9:35:45 PM Mountain Daylight Time, mina@mabb.net ... can you hop onto cartoonnetwork.com and play the cartoon related games??

My daughter, Anna, was <br/>\nin the  7th grade and she loved school.  She was an excellent student, every <br/>\nteacher&#39;s dream.  The first few months of being out of school ( we unschooled <br/>\nfrom the start), she was very antsy, anxious, worried.  She also asked me to <br/>\nget her workbooks, make her a schedule, give her assignments..etc.   She felt <br/>\ntotally lost and and like she was just &quot;wasting time&quot;.     I never prohibited <br/>\nher from &quot;doing work&quot; I did make workbooks available to her.  I did make her out <br/>\na schedule and give her assignments. She didn&#39;t do any of them.. LOL.   She <br/>\nsaid, what was the use in doing them if they were not &quot;required&quot;  Unschooling <br/>\nwas a big adjustment for her.   It was so different from school life.  And, in <br/>\nher case, she enjoyed school and all of it&#39;s trappings.  OR, so she thought <br/>\n:-)   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna slowly but surely started to trust herself., to become self-motivated.   <br/>\nShe began to see that she had the freedom to learn about anything she wanted <br/>\nto.. or not.   She began to explore her own personal interests and hobbies in <br/>\ndepth.   One of the biggest things she learned was that SHE was capable of <br/>\ndirecting her own learning.    She now does not have to rely on someone else to <br/>\ntell her what to do, what to learn.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  Of course, I had to guide and nurture that trust.  I didn&#39;t just say &quot;get <br/>\nover it&quot;.   If she said she was bored, I would make suggestions.  Sometimes she <br/>\nfollowed them, sometimes not.  I was (am) here to answer any questions she <br/>\nhas, provide any resources she wants/needs.  (books, transportation, passing <br/>\nalong info I recieve, etc) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ironic that just today, before I read the post I am replying to.. Anna <br/>\nand I had this conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe- &quot;How do you like unschooling?&quot; <br/>\nAnna- &quot;I like it, I like it alot&quot;.<br/>\nMe- &quot;Do you want to keep unschooling, or do you want to do more curriculum <br/>\ntype stuff?&quot; <br/>\nAnna - . &quot;UNCHOOLING!, DEFINITELY!&quot; ( no hesitation)  lol...<br/>\n Me -  &quot;But at first, you didnt really like it&quot; <br/>\nAnna -  &quot;I know, but, now I do, I think its alot better than school or school <br/>\nat home&quot;<br/>\nMe- &quot;Do you feel like you are learning all the time&quot;<br/>\nAnna - .. &quot;Hmm, well, yeah, but I also think that now I know you don&#39;t really <br/>\nhave to know all the crap they teach in school to be a happy, successful <br/>\nperson&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  I laughed at that, and I said, &#39;well, yeah, thats true. but, we are really <br/>\nalways learning, all the time.. all of us.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna - &quot;Yeah, you are right.. because you just told me all about how these <br/>\ndrinks (Set-ups from a local grill) were really intended as alcohol mixers&quot;   <br/>\nMe-    &quot;LOL, yeah, you&#39;re right.. see, we do learn something new every day&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, before you folks think I gave Anna a &quot;lesson&quot; on the origin of Set-ups.. <br/>\nlol.. Let me clarify.   We stopped at the local grill to get Set-ups.. a <br/>\nsummer ( well, anytime) favorite.  Anna asked me what was in Set-ups, and I told <br/>\nher.  Sundrop, Cherry soda, cherries and lemons.  She said, &quot;why are they c<br/>\nalled &quot;Set-ups?&quot;   So, I told her what a REAL &quot;Set-up&quot; is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnna has made the most radical changes in her thinking among my children.  <br/>\nEthan and JP hated school, so they always loved unschooling..  She wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nDREAM of doing a workbook now.  At times I think.. OH NO, She is TOO independent.. <br/>\nlol.  The other night, I was watching &quot;The Donner Party&quot; on PBS.  I  asked <br/>\nher if she wanted to watch it with me.  She said.. &quot;uhh, no&quot;.  I said. &quot;come on, <br/>\nits good, its a true story, very historical&quot;.

Have you asked him what he means by bored?  Boredom is<br/>\nactually a <br/>\nprecursor to creative explosions at my house.  But the state of boredom<br/>\nis <br/>\ngenerally not very pleasant for any involved.  Sometimes my kids (age<br/>\n10-19, 3 <br/>\nboys and 3 girls) use the boredom thing to indicate that they need more<br/>\nfriend <br/>\ncontact, or that they can&#39;t find anything to watch on TV or do on the<br/>\ncomputer.  <br/>\nBut sometimes &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; means I am a tired, I am sad, or I am having a<br/>\ndown <br/>\nday rather than that there are not exciting opportunities available.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nToday he is bent on getting a new game, thinking that will solve all<br/>\nproblems.  I keep trying to reason with him that the last 5 games I<br/>\nbought this summer haven&#39;t solved anything yet, but... I may get one<br/>\nanyway since I&#39;m trying to talk him into coming to a very boring hair<br/>\nappointment with me (and I can&#39;t get ahold of any grandparents for some<br/>\nreason).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the beginning when I first pulled my kids out of school they were<br/>\nbored a <br/>\nlot.  They had certain expectations of being entertained.  After a<br/>\nwhile, for <br/>\nthe youngest it was about 3 weeks, for the older one it was months, they<br/>\n<br/>\nreally developed some wonderful skills to find an interest in many<br/>\n&quot;mundane&quot; things <br/>\nand they learned to rely on each other for stimulation.  These skills<br/>\nwere <br/>\nmanifest in a striking contrast when I had to take my kids to my<br/>\nsister&#39;s <br/>\nfuneral.  All of the cousins were at the visitation and funeral and,<br/>\netc., and there <br/>\nwas much whining about boredom from many quarters but not from my kids.<br/>\nThe <br/>\nother relatives remarked on it.( these are the same people who think I<br/>\nam <br/>\ncertifiable for homeschooling) and my kids shortly organized a bunch of<br/>\npencil <br/>\npaper quiet games for the visitation with the younger children.  Then<br/>\nback at the <br/>\nhouse they organized creative ball games that all the kids could star in<br/>\nand <br/>\nan interesting synchronized scooter and skateboard show for the tween<br/>\nset.  I <br/>\nwas proud of their abilities to not only occupy themselves and others<br/>\nbut also <br/>\nfor their wonderful abilities to converse with all the adults as well <br/>\n(something none of the other teenagers in their sullenness were<br/>\ninterested in).<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this input!  It&#39;s exactly what I suspected, but wasn&#39;t too<br/>\nsure.  Since I was &quot;homeschooled&quot; and in the boonies with few friends I<br/>\nalso became good at self-entertainment.  But I may have been good at it<br/>\nanyway, who knows.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, your son may just need time to develop some more skills to <br/>\nself-motivate and entertain.  He may also be really missing his brother<br/>\nand not know how <br/>\nto say it exactly.  I would help him process his feelings and explore<br/>\nhis <br/>\nsolutions rather than rushing to up the entertainment ante.  A lot of<br/>\nthe <br/>\nphilosophy of unschooling as I understand it is about being &quot;real&quot; in<br/>\nyour learning.  <br/>\nIn my house, at least, it is very &quot;real&quot; that life is not one series of <br/>\nentertaining events after another, but it doesn&#39;t have to be boring<br/>\neither.  Listen <br/>\nto him talk about how he feels and what he wants, share with him your<br/>\ndesires <br/>\nand thoughts as well.  Hopefully somewhere in there you will figure it<br/>\nout <br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, life shouldn&#39;t be all about trying to entertain all the time.<br/>\nI&#39;m never sure how much of that to do - my youngest would like me to<br/>\nplay games with him *all day* and I get bored to death after awhile.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] A question about boredom","postDate":"1058981164","msgId":77468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJDQjM0NzdBLUJEMzItMTFENy04OTUyLTAwMEE5NTZFMTA5RUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzNTEyZCRhZWU5YzU0MCQzODc3ZmVhOUBNT01TVE9ZPg=="},"prevInTopic":77467,"nextInTopic":77469,"prevInTime":77467,"nextInTime":77469,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How do you all deal with <br/>\n&gt; boredom?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is probably a big adjustment for kids to suddenly have whole<br/>\ndays to fill, and maybe sometimes when you can&#39;t think of anything you<br/>\nwant to do right away, you sort of panic and go towards the familiar,<br/>\nwhich would be school. There are also all the societal messages about<br/>\nschool that your son has gotten, even if he&#39;s not consciously aware of<br/>\nit, he&#39;s heard for years how School is Important and You Must Attend. I<br/>\nthink it can be scary to make that change, and sometimes when I&#39;m sort of<br/>\nlow-grade scared about things it manifests more as being sort of antsy<br/>\nand bored. <br/>\n<br/>\nRain only went to kindie, and she went to two different kindies, both odd<br/>\nin their own ways, and we decided to unschool near the end of the school<br/>\nyear and she was like, *Yes!*&quot;, and she already had good friends who were<br/>\nhomeschooling... but it still was an adjustment. I don&#39;t remember her<br/>\nsaying she was bored, but she might have. I do remember her feeling like<br/>\nshe should be in school, somehow, and doing &quot;school stuff&quot;. She missed<br/>\nthe tire swing and the trinomial cube a lot. It lasted until maybe<br/>\nOctober or November... a couple of times she said she thought she&#39;d like<br/>\nto go back to school, and we talked specifically about what she was<br/>\nmissing and got our own trinomial cube and did some more structured stuff<br/>\nthrough the regional parks, and by November it wasn&#39;t an issue anymore,<br/>\nshe&#39;d adjusted and wasn&#39;t at all conflicted any more... but she only went<br/>\nto one year of school, a semester of teeny tiny Montessori (7 kids, I<br/>\nthink) and a semester of Reggio Emilia whole language anti-bias<br/>\ncurriculum charter school (think Berkeley, although technically the<br/>\nschool was a couple blocks into Oakland).<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12226183,"authorName":"Quiltsixer@aol.com","from":"Quiltsixer@...","profile":"quilt6er","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] A question about boredom","postDate":"1058979537","msgId":77462,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlYi5kOWFiNmM5LjJjNTAxOGQxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77461,"nextInTopic":77466,"prevInTime":77461,"nextInTime":77463,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sarah, You report that your son is bored to death but you didn t know it until you asked him.

Have you asked him what he means by bored?  Boredom is actually a <br/>\nprecursor to creative explosions at my house.  But the state of boredom is <br/>\ngenerally not very pleasant for any involved.  Sometimes my kids (age 10-19, 3 <br/>\nboys and 3 girls) use the boredom thing to indicate that they need more friend <br/>\ncontact, or that they can&#39;t find anything to watch on TV or do on the computer.  <br/>\nBut sometimes &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; means I am a tired, I am sad, or I am having a down <br/>\nday rather than that there are not exciting opportunities available.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning when I first pulled my kids out of school they were bored a <br/>\nlot.  They had certain expectations of being entertained.  After a while, for <br/>\nthe youngest it was about 3 weeks, for the older one it was months, they <br/>\nreally developed some wonderful skills to find an interest in many &quot;mundane&quot; things <br/>\nand they learned to rely on each other for stimulation.  These skills were <br/>\nmanifest in a striking contrast when I had to take my kids to my sister&#39;s <br/>\nfuneral.  All of the cousins were at the visitation and funeral and, etc., and there <br/>\nwas much whining about boredom from many quarters but not from my kids.  The <br/>\nother relatives remarked on it.( these are the same people who think I am <br/>\ncertifiable for homeschooling) and my kids shortly organized a bunch of pencil <br/>\npaper quiet games for the visitation with the younger children.  Then back at the <br/>\nhouse they organized creative ball games that all the kids could star in and <br/>\nan interesting synchronized scooter and skateboard show for the tween set.  I <br/>\nwas proud of their abilities to not only occupy themselves and others but also <br/>\nfor their wonderful abilities to converse with all the adults as well <br/>\n(something none of the other teenagers in their sullenness were interested in).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, your son may just need time to develop some more skills to <br/>\nself-motivate and entertain.  He may also be really missing his brother and not know how <br/>\nto say it exactly.  I would help him process his feelings and explore his <br/>\nsolutions rather than rushing to up the entertainment ante.  A lot of the <br/>\nphilosophy of unschooling as I understand it is about being &quot;real&quot; in your learning.  <br/>\nIn my house, at least, it is very &quot;real&quot; that life is not one series of <br/>\nentertaining events after another, but it doesn&#39;t have to be boring either.  Listen <br/>\nto him talk about how he feels and what he wants, share with him your desires <br/>\nand thoughts as well.  Hopefully somewhere in there you will figure it out <br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":70316959,"authorName":"AimeeL73@cs.com","from":"AimeeL73@...","profile":"aimeels73","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] A question about boredom","postDate":"1058977991","msgId":77461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5LjNhZjE1ZDQzLjJjNTAxMmM3QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77460,"nextInTopic":77462,"prevInTime":77460,"nextInTime":77462,"topicId":77457,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He finishes his &quot;work&quot; and reads<br/>\nthe rest of the day.
