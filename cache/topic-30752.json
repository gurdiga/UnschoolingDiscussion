Not a<br/>\nhealthy situation in my opinion.  This boy is an only child and has grown<br/>\ntoo accustomed to these things for entertainment.&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo I would be looking at the parents of this kid and wondering why they aren<br/>\nt taking him out and about to stimulate some interests other than tv.  Why<br/>\nisn&#39;t he building with legos? Why isn&#39;t he building a soapbox car? Why isn&#39;t<br/>\nhe pulling out a game he normally plays every Friday night with his Dad? Why<br/>\nisn&#39;t hetelling your kids about some cool secret passage he&#39;s just<br/>\ndiscovered in the computer game, Myst? Is this a public schooled kid? Is he<br/>\nusing his outside-of-school time just to chill? Has he already been<br/>\nconditioned into thinking that a social life is when kids similar in age are<br/>\nlined up side by side but not interacting; rather thay are staring at the<br/>\nfront of the room/tv? \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  Pat wrote:\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I agree with Kolleen about the need for the environment to be full of<br/>\nstimulating things for kids to do including other! kids to play with&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I also agree with Kolleen that the environment needs to be a stimulating one<br/>\nand we (parents) should be taking the kids out to various places (science<br/>\nmuseums, clubs, art galleries, etc.) These can be things the parent is<br/>\ninterested in, not necessarily the children although often the kids will<br/>\ndevelop an interest when exposed to something new.  I love to do art stuff<br/>\nand I take the kids with me to all sorts of places to get inspiration and<br/>\nnew ideas. My kids also see things on tv that generate an interst and it&#39;s<br/>\nmy job to take that opportunity to expand their world in that area. (note:<br/>\nand to also realize when it&#39;s just a passing curiosity and not a real<br/>\npassion. In other words, don&#39;t go out and buy some expensive item just<br/>\nbecause they said &quot;I wonder...&quot; about it.

Just a thought.  My nephew has no limits placed on him (for anything), my children have some, when my girls spent the week with him this past summer, they wound up playing games and doing things with their aunt because their cousin was too busy watching TV or playing video games.  When we see him at the grandmothers house, he is fun to play with because the TV is not on although, during a few hour visits with us this past Christmas, he warned us that he would not respond to anyone while &quot;The Simpson&#39;s&quot; were on.  Not a healthy situation in my opinion.  This boy is an only child and has grown too accustomed to these things for entertainment.  I agree with Kolleen about the need for the environment to be full of stimulating things for kids to do including other kids to play with however once the pattern is set with too much TV, it might be hard to break.
