I don&#39;t<br/>\nforce my kids to learn anything (education) but sometimes I do need the kids<br/>\nto do something they already know how to do, such as clean up a mess they<br/>\nmade (chores---we call anything that needs to get done a chore, many of them<br/>\nwe enjoy, many of them are simply necessary, the kids have chores, I have<br/>\nchores, dh has chores)<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  I don&#39;t need dd to learn to read.  No one is relying on her to<br/>\nlearn to read.  She will learn it when she either wants to or needs to.<br/>\nBUT....I need her to clean her rabbit cages.  The rabbit is relying on her<br/>\nfor his health.  She doesn&#39;t need to learn how to do it.  She already knows<br/>\nhow, she just needs to bite the bullet.  The rabbit is a project of hers,<br/>\nchosen freely by her from which she earns ribbons, honors and sometimes even<br/>\nmoney based on how she compares with other rabbit raisers.  Because of this,<br/>\nI don&#39;t help out much with them.  I help out a lot with the dog, its a pet,<br/>\nits hers, but there is no competition as to her husbandry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we as a family have chosen to handle the chore situation is with a<br/>\nbreakfast meeting.  We all talk about what needs to be done that day<br/>\n(shopping, vacuuming, clean rabbit cages, whatever) with everyone having<br/>\ninput.  Then people begin to volunteer for chores that they prefer.  Today,<br/>\n8yo volunteered to fix lunch and dust while 4yo volunteered to clean<br/>\ntoilets.  I volunteered to clean 10yo rabbit cages because her wrist is<br/>\ninjured.  All kids volunteered to help straighten mess the 2yo made in 10yo<br/>\nroom.  Usually there are 1 or 2 things left that nobody jumped up an down<br/>\nabout and usually I do those or we do them together.  But we consider these<br/>\nthings chores because they have to get done.
