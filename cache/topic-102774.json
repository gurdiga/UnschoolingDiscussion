I checked out the spicey discussion on the message <br/>\nboard.  I&#39;m glad to see that Grace Llewlynn has posted a response <br/>\njust yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not uncommon for people to misunderstand bellydancing (and in <br/>\nthis case, perhaps, hold grudges) and I think this is part of what <br/>\nthe upcoming movie on Belly Dance attempts to delve into.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know Grace personally, but I do live in the same town as her <br/>\n(Eugene, Oregon), and can say that bellydancing is VERY popular and <br/>\nloved in this town.  There is a Gypsy Stage at The Oregon Country <br/>\nFair which has bellydancing (and a little African and Flamenco) all <br/>\nday long for 3 days (plus more for staff and volunteers).  Grace is a <br/>\nbellydancer, and I was more intrigued with her bellydancing webpage <br/>\nthan her NBTSC, to be honest!  What can I say, I&#39;m a bellydancing <br/>\njunky!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennefer<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Date: Thu, 20 Jan 2005 11:48:33 EST<br/>\n   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: Re:Belly Dancing<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of you have any free-floating energy and want to defend belly <br/>\ndancing, <br/>\nit has been attacked as being inappropriate to have been performed at <br/>\nthe Not <br/>\nBack To School Camp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/11005.html\">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/11005.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102683,"nextTopicId":102755}}
