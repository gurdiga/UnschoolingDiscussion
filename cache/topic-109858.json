How is that<br/>\nbalanced?<br/>\nI think of children as foreigners to a strange land. Each year, they<br/>\nlearn more and better skills for navigating life..but until they gain<br/>\nthose tools, or learn those skills, they need a guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery person in this house deserves peace and safety. If anyone wants<br/>\nto take that away, I will stop that person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned through being mindful, is that 90% of problems are<br/>\naverted by being present with my children. As they get older, they<br/>\nneed that presence less, but they also have better skills by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe days we have more problems, are the days I&#39;m not being available<br/>\nenough.  It&#39;s a good reminder to really BE with them, be part of their<br/>\nworld and involved in their activities. When that happens, I can use<br/>\nthe better skills I have in negotiation and relationships, to avert<br/>\npotential fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109818,"nextTopicId":109824}}
