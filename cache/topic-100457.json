She&#39;s not quite as<br/>\n&#39;unschoolish&#39; as we are, but her daughter is part of the family while she is<br/>\nhere. Her mom works about 25-30 hours a week. Just enough to live on with<br/>\nchild support.  She doesn&#39;t have a high standard of living, but she is home<br/>\nwith her daughter. I earn a little extra money and get to play with a little<br/>\ngirl again.  We&#39;ve had her for over two years now. She gets to be involved<br/>\nin more activities as she joins us in ours and she has a homeschool friendly<br/>\nenvironment.

Unschooling need not occur between the hours of 7:15 and 2:45.  Your child could stay with a trusted friend or relative while you&#39;re at work.  Depending on your job, and the child&#39;s age, s/he could accompany you to work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf this were my situation, and my child did not want to go to school, I would find a way that she could stay out of school.
