Stay safe. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a night like that once when we lived in a somewhat seedy apartment<br/>\ncomplex in Columbia.  We were out on our balcony relaxing when five cops<br/>\ncame across the lawn with their guns drawn asking for building 333.  We were<br/>\nlike, &quot;Uh, that&#39;s this one.  Listen, we&#39;re, uh, going inside now!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to ask if you were still good with bringing that plate for Kelly,<br/>\nor if it might be easier for you to mail it, and I&#39;ll just pay you when you<br/>\nget here?  I don&#39;t want you to feel overloaded.  It occurred to me later<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll have boxes of tapes and maybe thinking sticks, and presentation<br/>\nstuff, too.  Sorry I saddled you with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re staying with Kelly&#39;s mom now.  It&#39;s better, Tim and Duncan just didn&#39;t<br/>\nwork out together.  I had a great time up in Greenville with my friend from<br/>\nGermany who moved to SC.  Tim says he&#39;s definitely going to marry her<br/>\ndaughter now.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSee you later this week.  Maybe I&#39;ll be done ranting at Deniz by then....&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] hi, and question","postDate":"1061213096","msgId":79021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Yy4xZThkZjM1ZC4yYzcyMmRhOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":79019,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":79020,"nextInTime":79022,"topicId":79019,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/18/03 7:22:53 AM, abtleo@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-814854347\">In a message dated 8/18/03 7:22:53 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I wanted to ask if you were still good with bringing that plate for Kelly,<br/>\nor if it might be easier for you to mail it, and I&#39;ll just pay you when you<br/>\nget here? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLa la la  (Shhhhhhhhhhhh.
