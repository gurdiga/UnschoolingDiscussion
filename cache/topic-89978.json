The Christmas decorations are amazing--it is a wonderful time to go if you can brave the weather. At night the line the streets with torches and have carolers and a military music concert that&#39;s terrific! All these young kids from the fife and drummers play--I could just picture my homeschool son getting into reenactments and doing something like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of the outdoor stuff doesn&#39;t happen in inclement weather (no carriage rides for instance), but there are few people at that time of the year, so you really get to talk to the re-enactors and do things that you don&#39;t get to do at busier times of the year. We spoke to one of the wig makers for quite a while, and that was truly fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that may seriously consider a trip out here, you could do a really great loop from Williamsburg to Monticello (Jefferson&#39;s home) to Mount Vernon (Washington&#39;s home) to DCs monuments and museums.  Loads of things to do!<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93092873,"authorName":"lamoseley@aol.com","from":"lamoseley@...","profile":"lsam400803","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Williamsburg covered in snow..","postDate":"1075513259","msgId":89987,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhiLjI0Yzk5N2EuMmQ0YzYxYWJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":89983,"nextInTopic":90005,"prevInTime":89986,"nextInTime":89988,"topicId":89978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am so jealous.

There are always different events scheduled, different people, etc. I don&#39;t think two visits would ever be alike! We also just *love* Colonial Williamsburg--there is so much to do. We&#39;re really looking forward to the weather warming up because we&#39;ve yet to make it to Jamestown!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, for anyone considering the Live and Learn Conference, Plimoth Plantation is incredible! I actually enjoyed the time up there even more than Williamsburg. The one bummer is that they ask guests not to dress up, whereas Williamsburg welcomes it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty much a huge fan of both, though, and would highly recommend them both.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158112576,"authorName":"Teresa","from":"&quot;Teresa&quot; &lt;TeresaBnNC@...&gt;","profile":"tbb1967","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Williamsburg covered in snow..","postDate":"1075506621","msgId":89979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ2ZXFqdCs2ZW1zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjYy4xOGI1MjE3ZC4yZDRjMzMwZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89978,"nextInTopic":89983,"prevInTime":89978,"nextInTime":89980,"topicId":89978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, the expectations for our week in Wlmsbrg did not come to fruition thanks to the winter storm that blanketed VA ( as well as many other states).

We did manage to get out for a couple of hours <br/>\non Tues, Wed, and Thurs.  Tues and Wed were so cold, mucky, yucky, <br/>\nstill icy, we only saw a couple of things and headed back in to our <br/>\nWONDERFUL accomodations. ( THANK GOODNESS we had a great timeshare <br/>\nwith all the amenities to keep 6 kids occupied and happy)  Thursday <br/>\nwas much warmer and dryer and we enjoyed several sights.  Still, we <br/>\nbarely scratched the surface of everything that is offered in this <br/>\nlovely, interesting Colonial town.  We have our Freedom passes, which <br/>\nare good for a year, so we will definitely be going back when the <br/>\nweather warms up.  The good thing is, now we are completely oriented <br/>\nwith the town, we know what we want to see, and we won&#39;t spend as <br/>\nmuch time consulting the map :-)   I have to say, for anyone who <br/>\nenjoys American History, Wlmsbrg is THE PLACE to put on your &quot;to do&quot; <br/>\nlist.  It is very &quot;self guided&quot;  You can ask as many or as few <br/>\nquestions as you like.  The interpreters ( costumed guides) are all <br/>\nvery friendly and amazingly knowlegeable about many historical points <br/>\nfrom the lives of the characters they portray, to political events, <br/>\ngeographical facts, HECK.. anything about America in the 1770s.. and <br/>\nbefore, and after.. LOL..<br/>\n<br/>\n Anna and I most enjoyed &quot;A conversation with the ladies of the <br/>\ntown&quot;  One lady was the sister of Patrick Henry, I didn&#39;t catch who <br/>\nthe other lady was.. They were sitting, doing needlework, just <br/>\ntalking about current gossip of the day, asking us questions, <br/>\nanswering questions.. It was most intriguing.  Patrick Henry&#39;s speech <br/>\nwas also very interesting. The boys loved the foundry.  They each got <br/>\nto file on some pewter spoons, pull the bellows to stoke the fire.. <br/>\nWe watched the tradesmen tarnish candlesticks and mold spoons and <br/>\nfile candlesticks.  JP would have glady stayed as thier apprentice :-<br/>\n)  We also especially enjoyed visting with a slave from Peyton <br/>\nRandolphs house.  In the slave quaters, we warmed ourself by the fire <br/>\nin the small, sparse room that accomdated over 15 slaves.   John, <br/>\n(the HUGE man) joked and laughed with us, asked the kids riddles, and <br/>\nlet Ethan try on the Mans servant coat.   Although it was cold, and <br/>\nwe didnt get to do nearly as much as we wanted, the quality of the <br/>\ntime we spent in town was exceptional.  Since there were few <br/>\ntravelers, we got lots of one on one time and special attention.  We <br/>\nall agreed that a dream come true would be to get to &quot;work&quot; in <br/>\nWlmbsrg as an interpreter..
