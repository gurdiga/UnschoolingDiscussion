And, like other antiques, <br/>\nthings like provenance, rarity, and condition play a part in the <br/>\nvalue. And, too, sometimes they&#39;re just fun - really old atlases are <br/>\npretty interesting (we&#39;re talking atlases from the 1800s and such).</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191465758,"authorName":"Beverley Paine","from":"&quot;Beverley Paine&quot; &lt;contact@...&gt;","profile":"beverleypaine1958","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"book worship","postDate":"1125564071","msgId":108066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTIwMWM1YWVkMCRlODViYWQ0MCQwMTAwYThjMEB3b3JrYWhvbGljPg==","referencesHeader":"PDExMjU0ODE0MDUuNDkyLjEyOTg2Lm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108067,"prevInTime":108065,"nextInTime":108067,"topicId":108066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, speaking of book worship, which I freely and unabashedly admit...

Ahhhhh....now it&#39;s finally <br/>\nstarting to feel like home. I love my books!<br/>\nWho was it--Cicero?--who said a room without books is like a body <br/>\nwithout a soul.<br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all, when I finally tire of doing all the silly things I fill my life up with, I&#39;m going to build a library. I did this exercise once, from The Artists Way by Julia Cameron, where I wrote down all the things my inner perfect child wanted and she wanted a library, kind of like the one in the My Fair Lady movie. I liked the dresses too... so my library will have lots of rich textures and smells - wood grain, leather, stone, silk, satin, velvet... And glass fronted bookshelves... <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to stock the library with classics and books that I love, especially children&#39;s books, and antique books (is there such a thing as antique books?) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I grow up (retire?) I&#39;m going to turn into a reader of books. Right now I spend all day reading the screen... and writing. (and renovating houses and landscaping and gardening and growing plants). <br/>\n<br/>\nwishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>\nBeverley Paine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a> and <br/>\nAlways Learning Books - www.alwayslearningbooks.com.au <br/>\nPO Box 371, Yankalilla 5203 South Australia<br/>\n<br/>\nSend a self-addressed, stamped envelope for a free getting started <br/>\nwith homeschooling information newsletter to the above address.<br/>\nRead latest Homeschool Australia blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hablog.beverleypaine.com\">http://hablog.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com\">http://homeschoolaustralia.beverleypaine.com</a><br/>\nReceive regular tips about how easy homeschooling can be, as well as book reviews:<br/>\nemail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">dailyhomeschoolingtips-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108065,"nextTopicId":107941}}
