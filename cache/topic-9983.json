The youngest two<br/>\nwanted jobs to do too so we gave them some paying jobs too. We made the<br/>\nwages age appropriate. 50 cents a day for daily jobs and if you did all<br/>\nyour jobs every day without being nagged then you got double allowance<br/>\nat the end of the week.<br/>\nNathan put over $200 away in a year .<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve gotten away from that style of payment but I think it&#39;ll be<br/>\nrevised and we&#39;ll be using that method again shortly (they&#39;re all a lot<br/>\nolder and can handle different more complex responsibilities now so they<br/>\nshould be paid accordingly).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all either help or do their own laundry. The oldest (14 ) is<br/>\nresponsible for the supper dishes and puts out the recylables to the<br/>\ncurb once a week.She is responsible for our puppy in the evenings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 10 yob gets to take the trash out once a week. He helps with puppy<br/>\nand is the official pooper scooper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe youngest 8 1/2 yog just likes to help so she helps with little<br/>\nthings like folding tea towels and dish cloths etc. She is always asking<br/>\nto help in the kitchen with baking etc ... not just licking the spoons<br/>\n;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pay for a job when it is completed satisfactorily they are told<br/>\nwhat&#39;s expected and have it demonstrated a couple of times (like<br/>\ncleaning a bathroom or washing a floor) and if you don&#39;t do it right the<br/>\nfirst time then you have to go back and do it right to be paid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people think that&#39;s harsh. We don&#39;t force them to do this. They are<br/>\nexpected to do their regular chores. We&#39;ll buy them an ice cream ,toy,<br/>\nkit or a soda when we&#39;re out shopping etc, so it&#39;s not a case of them<br/>\nhaving to earn to buy that kind of thing for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do have to earn though to buy those pokemon cards that I refuse to<br/>\nbuy or get clothes that I figure they don&#39;t need or are frivolous. They<br/>\ncan earn and spend their own cash on that kind of thing. There is always<br/>\na closet that needs cleaning out or weeds to be pulled or canning that I<br/>\ncould use help with etc.<br/>\nThere are plenty of opportunities to earn hard cash around here!<br/>\n<br/>\nBuzz<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   <br/>\n The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when <br/>\n Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been <br/>\n Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n Samantha                  B.F.
