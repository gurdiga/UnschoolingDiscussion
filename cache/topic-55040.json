I have friends in town who are <br/>\nFrench. I&#39;ve lived in France and speak French. I went to college in <br/>\nFrance for a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the French moms invited a number of homeschoolers <br/>\nover to meet other French mothers. They didn&#39;t know anything <br/>\nabout homeschooling and asked us all kinds of questions. The <br/>\nmost startling response to all our sharing was when one mother <br/>\nsaid,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Even if the education is inferior and even if the children don&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy it, I would not want to pull my children out of the state <br/>\nfunded programs to make them better than other people. We <br/>\nshould all have the same education and not make some <br/>\nsuperior to others.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell tie my shoelaces!<br/>\n<br/>\nRight there I saw the cultural absorption of the ideals of <br/>\nsocialism. all the motehrs basically agreed with this position, yet <br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t let go of their fascination with our way of doing <br/>\nthings. It was enlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing they also said was that their kids loved going to school <br/>\nin the states! They loved the way the students could get up and <br/>\nmove around a classroom, the encouragement of group projects <br/>\nand the absence of ridicule as a method of motivation (very <br/>\nprevalent in France). They also preferred the way teachers used <br/>\nmulti media to the typical workbook program all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was interesting. France made these poor kids keep up with <br/>\ntheir French grade levels in addition to their schooling here so <br/>\nthese kids were literally doing two times the work of our kids in <br/>\nschool here. I felt so badly for them. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nUniversity in France was a kick! Classes began in Sept. but the <br/>\nstudents didn&#39;t show up until mid Oct and sometimes not until <br/>\nthe New Year. Classes lasted all year. I actually enjoyed my <br/>\nclasses there very much, even though they weren&#39;t that rigorous. <br/>\nI was used to UCLA which is a pretty academic school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a painful apathy in French children and they are <br/>\nnotoriously mischevious. It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve noticed over <br/>\nthe years (we lived in Morocco too and knew French families <br/>\nthere...). But the mothers are actually quite wonderful in many <br/>\nways too. They don&#39;t believe in corporal punishment, are very <br/>\naffectionate and they lead rich artisitc lives compared to what I&#39;m <br/>\nused to here.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that to say that I&#39;m not at all surprised that the government <br/>\nwould say school isn&#39;t meant to be fun. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112038769,"authorName":"Shyrley","from":"Shyrley &lt;shyrley.williams@...&gt;","profile":"bobalinga","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"School is meant to be boring...","postDate":"1042640595","msgId":55040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFMjU2RUQzLjlCRTNBMzNBQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE1NTI2MTE4MzYtMTQ2Mzc0NzgzOC0xMDQyNjIwOTUyQHRvcGljYS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":55073,"prevInTime":55039,"nextInTime":55041,"topicId":55040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think there is an unparallelled opportunity to send letters to the Times about the superiority of home education.
