I have never been to the Rowe conference center but have heard<br/>\nwonderful things.  It sounds a bit like the place people are describing<br/>\nin Great Barrington.   It has trails and bunk houses, etc...Usually<br/>\nprices for conferences held there include food (vegetarian), lodging and<br/>\nworkshops.  I can let you know what I think after I attend the Flower<br/>\nEssence conference which is held there in June.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe website is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:retreat@...\">retreat@...</a>.<br/>\nI also wanted to mention a group I have met in Arlington Ma.  The web<br/>\npage is homeschoolingtogether.org and they put together a one day<br/>\nunschooling conference last April.  They may be able to help or have<br/>\nsome ideas to offer.  Looking forward to meeting othres!  :) Sharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66527,"nextTopicId":66219}}
