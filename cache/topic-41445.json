Many people who show animals are cruel to them.<br/>\nExamples commonly used in 4-H goat programs:  tying a goat with his head<br/>\npulled as high as possible for at least an hour per day, keeping goats in<br/>\nsmall pens, chasing goats with dogs or 4-wheelers to &quot;exercise&quot; them,<br/>\noverloading the animals with vaccinations and wormers rather than providing<br/>\na semi-natural habitat for them, overloading them with grain to increase<br/>\nweight which leads to medical problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t treat our animals that way.  Ours are treated as humanely and<br/>\nrespectfully as possible.  We use attention and relationships with our<br/>\nanimals to train them.  We would not want to be lumped in with people who<br/>\nmistreat their animals simply because we train and show animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that in most areas of animal showmanship there are &quot;bronc busters&quot;<br/>\nand there are &quot;horse whisperers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41425,"nextTopicId":41410}}
