No U.S. endangered species would be affected.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Conservation groups counter that killing or capturing even a few animals<br/>\n&gt; is hardly the best way to protect endangered species, and say the<br/>\n&gt; policies cater to individuals and businesses that profit from animal<br/>\n&gt; exploitation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s a very dangerous precedent to decide that wildlife exploitation is<br/>\n&gt; in the best interest of wildlife,&quot; said Adam Roberts, a senior research<br/>\n&gt; associate at the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute, an advocacy group<br/>\n&gt; for endangered species.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The latest proposal involves an interpretation of the Endangered Species<br/>\n&gt; Act that deviates radically from the course followed by Republican and<br/>\n&gt; Democratic administrations since President Nixon signed the act in 1973.<br/>\n&gt; The law established broad protection for endangered species, most of<br/>\n&gt; which are not native to America, and effectively prohibited trade in them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kenneth Stansell, assistant director for international affairs at Fish<br/>\n&gt; and Wildlife, said there has been a growing realization that the<br/>\n&gt; Endangered Species Act provides poor countries no incentive to protect<br/>\n&gt; dying species. Allowing American hunters, circuses and the pet industry<br/>\n&gt; to pay countries to take fixed numbers of animals from the wild would<br/>\n&gt; pay for conservation programs for remaining animals, he said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; U.S. officials note that such trade is open to hunters, pet importers<br/>\n&gt; and zoos in other Western nations. They say the idea is supported by<br/>\n&gt; poor countries that are home to the endangered species and would benefit<br/>\n&gt; from the revenue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Officials at the Department of Interior and Fish and Wildlife, who are<br/>\n&gt; leading many of the new policies, said the proposals merely implement<br/>\n&gt; rarely used provisions in the law.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;This is absolutely consistent with the Endangered Species Act, as<br/>\n&gt; written,&quot; said David Smith, deputy assistant secretary at the Department<br/>\n&gt; of Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. &quot;I think the nature of the<br/>\n&gt; beast is such that there are critics who are going to claim some kind of<br/>\n&gt; ulterior motive.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Animal-welfare advocates question the logic of the new approach, saying<br/>\n&gt; that foreign countries and groups that stand to profit will be in charge<br/>\n&gt; of determining how many animals can be killed or captured. Advocates<br/>\n&gt; also warn that opening the door to legal trade will allow poaching to<br/>\n&gt; flourish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;As soon as you place a financial price on the head of wild animals, the<br/>\n&gt; incentive is to kill the animal or capture them,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; minute people find out they can have an easier time killing, shipping<br/>\n&gt; and profiting from wildlife, they will do so.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The proposals also trigger a visceral response: To many animal lovers,<br/>\n&gt; these species have emotional and symbolic value, and never should be<br/>\n&gt; captured or killed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The Endangered Species Act prohibits removing domestic endangered<br/>\n&gt; species from the wild. Until now, that protection was extended to<br/>\n&gt; foreign species. Explaining the change, Stansell said, &quot;There is a<br/>\n&gt; recognition that these sovereign nations have a different way of<br/>\n&gt; managing their natural resources.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Indeed, many of the strongest advocates for &quot;sustainable-use&quot; programs<br/>\n&gt; -- under which some animals are &quot;harvested&quot; to raise money to save the<br/>\n&gt; rest -- have been countries that are home to various endangered species.<br/>\n&gt; Foreign trade groups and governments have tried for years to convince<br/>\n&gt; the United States that animals no longer are in limited supply, or that<br/>\n&gt; capturing or killing fixed numbers would not drive a species to <br/>\n&gt; extinction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That could change after Friday, the end of the public-comment period on<br/>\n&gt; one proposed change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; John Monson, a New Hampshire trophy hunter and former chairman of that<br/>\n&gt; state&#39;s Fish and Game Commission, said the program would help preserve<br/>\n&gt; rare animals. Monson applied for a permit in 1999 to shoot and import a<br/>\n&gt; straight-horned markhor. He was turned down.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Monson is president-elect of Safari Club International, a national<br/>\n&gt; hunting advocacy group. He agreed to an interview only in his personal<br/>\n&gt; capacity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Safari Club International gave $274,000 to candidates during the 2000<br/>\n&gt; election cycle, 86 percent of it to Republicans. It also spent $5,445<br/>\n&gt; printing bumper stickers for the Bush presidential campaign. Monson has<br/>\n&gt; made a variety of personal contributions, including $1,000 to the Bush<br/>\n&gt; for President campaign.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teresa Telecky, former director of the wildlife trade program at the<br/>\n&gt; Humane Society, blamed lobbying by Safari Club International and other<br/>\n&gt; special-interest groups for a &quot;sea change&quot; in conservation policy. &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; approach of this administration is it is all right to kill endangered or<br/>\n&gt; threatened species or capture them from the wild so long as somebody<br/>\n&gt; says there would be some conservation benefit,&quot; she said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stansell said conservation goals, not lobbying, drove the proposals,<br/>\n&gt; which he said evolved through previous administrations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Still, the application of &quot;sustainable use&quot; never has been so broad. The<br/>\n&gt; United States in November reversed its long-held position and voted to<br/>\n&gt; allow Botswana, Namibia and South Africa to resume trade in ivory.<br/>\n&gt; Stansell said the sales, which have not begun, will support elephant<br/>\n&gt; conservation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Susan Lieberman, former chief of the Scientific Authority at the<br/>\n&gt; Fish and Wildlife Service and now director of the species program at the<br/>\n&gt; World Wildlife Fund, said legal trade in ivory always triggers illegal<br/>\n&gt; poaching. &quot;Money doesn&#39;t always mean conservation,&quot; she added. &quot;To me,<br/>\n&gt; the theme is allowing an industry to write the rules, which is a Bush<br/>\n&gt; administration pattern.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Smith, the administration official, said permits would be issued only<br/>\n&gt; after foreign countries showed they had strong conservation programs.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;There is nothing else we have as a country to force other countries to<br/>\n&gt; conserve their wildlife, other than being paternalistic and saying &#39;no,<br/>\n&gt; no, no,&#39; &quot; he said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Copyright © 2003 The Seattle Times Company<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reprinted from The Seattle Times:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/\">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/</a><br/>\n&gt; nationworld/2001763582_animals110.html<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001763582_animals110.html\">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001763582_animals110.html</a>&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

She said he just hated bikes being on the road. The intern <br/>\nsaid there is an old man that lives in her neighborhood that shoots a <br/>\npellet gun at a group of 30 or so that ride by their house.she said.

Once again, more <br/>\ncalls rained in from people who agreed with him, and said that they <br/>\nwould do the same. Clear Channel stations across the nation are <br/>\nbroadcasting almost criminal &quot;kill bicyclists&quot; verbiage by shock jocks. <br/>\nThe recent attacks occured on G105 in the NC Triangle market two days in <br/>\na row (9/22-23/03). This follows similar comments by shows in Houston <br/>\nand Cleveland. Perhaps it is time to let Clear Channel know that these <br/>\nactions will not be tolerated by the cycling community. I would suggest <br/>\ncontacting current advertisers, both local and national, until Clear <br/>\nChannel adresses this problem. Some of the advertisers with G105 include <br/>\nToyota, US Cellular, Con Agra Foods, Applebees, and Kroger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis info was gathered from numerous posts on cycling forums and first <br/>\nhand accounts of the broadcast. TMTB.com urges you to contact the <br/>\nadvertizers on the show, g105 and Clear Channel to politely voice your <br/>\nopinion on the subject. They follow the money. If enough people write in <br/>\nand let them know they are going to stop listening, stop going to the <br/>\ncompanies that advertise; they might get the message.<br/>\n<br/>\nG105<br/>\nWDCG -FM Raleigh/Durham/<br/>\nChapel Hill<br/>\nMusic For All People<br/>\n<br/>\n3100 Smoketree Court,<br/>\n7th Floor<br/>\nRaleigh, NC 27604<br/>\n<br/>\nBusiness Hours: M-F, 9:00am - 5:00pm<br/>\nMain Phone: (919) 878-1500<br/>\nRequest/Contest Phone: (919) 860-1051<br/>\nStudio Fax: (919) 876-8578<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClear Channel<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr@...\">pr@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pr@...\">pr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInvestor Relations<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:randypalmer@...\">randypalmer@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:randypalmer@...\">randypalmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLowry Mays<br/>\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LLowryMays@...\">LLowryMays@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LLowryMays@...\">LLowryMays@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Mays<br/>\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MarkPMays@...\">MarkPMays@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MarkPMays@...\">MarkPMays@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1123183,"authorName":"dacunefare@aol.com","from":"dacunefare@...","profile":"undermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4027","postDate":"1064120747","msgId":81087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Ny4xZmU0ZWU1My4yYzllOGJhYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":81796,"prevInTime":81086,"nextInTime":81088,"topicId":81087,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://www.militantbreastfeedingcult.com/index_a.html A wonderful and truly humorous site in response.
