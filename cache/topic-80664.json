I did not agree with the true *chores* thing but <br/>\nwas not sure if we were doing the right thing by not requiring <br/>\nsomething.    You  have given me a new perspective on that.  You are <br/>\nright, he is just too busy playing and maybe when he is older it <br/>\nwill be different. <br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, we just moved and have a playroom downstairs and I could <br/>\ncare less about it&#39;s appearance.  In the other house, when the boys <br/>\nroom was messy it drove me crazy because they had to sleep in it so <br/>\nthis is much less stress :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nah, I don&#39;t think scheduled chores will help much, esp if he&#39;s so <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hit or <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; miss.  That would add stress, dontcha think?  And, he&#39;s only 5!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would just continue to ask him to do little things I would add <br/>\n </span></blockquote>asking him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to put his shoes away, and other little stuff that *he&#39;s* left <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out.  If you get <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a lot of no&#39;s on his own stuff, I would talk out loud about it as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you clean <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it up, asking him questions about where he would like it, etc.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;ll give him <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; an awareness of how much mess he made without being shamed or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pressured.  I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; would ask if he needs help putting something bigger or messier <br/>\n </span></blockquote>away, kinda <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hinting that it needs to be done, but not make a big deal if he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>wants to leave it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out for a while, or if he&#39;s busy.  Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>anyway, so <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that&#39;s my two cents. lol  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re not chore people here.  I&#39;m a reformed slob, so I&#39;ve gotten <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pretty <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; regimented as I clean and organize.  We bought a new place last <br/>\n </span></blockquote>year, and we moved <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from a grimey basement apt to a beautiful new condo, so I got very <br/>\n </span></blockquote>motivated <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to schedule ( or at least pay attention to how often things got <br/>\n </span></blockquote>done) my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; housework.  But if I don&#39;t wash the floor on tuesday, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>matter.  Maybe <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tuesday was a crappy day, or I was tired or busy, or we were out.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>If I have that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kind of flexibility, why should I be rigid about a chore schedule <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for my son? <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I&#39;ve read about charts and stars, etc, and that kind of thing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just makes my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; skin crawl! lol  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But it also means that a lot of times I want to vacuum and I find <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a pile of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; toys on the floor, or I want to dust and there&#39;s a project on the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>table, and if <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I ask my 9 yo if he&#39;s done for now, or if he could put that away <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so I can <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; clean, he almost always does that, or plays with it somewhere <br/>\n </span></blockquote>else.  It involves <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him somewhat but the line is his own stuff, he knows what he needs <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to do, but <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that I&#39;ll do it if he&#39;s busy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He does help out an awful lot, if I ask him, and more and more, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>even when I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; don&#39;t. If the sink is empty, he&#39;s likely to wash his plate or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bowl, because he <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; knows I like an empty sink.  If there&#39;s a bag of garbage, he&#39;ll <br/>\n </span></blockquote>often take it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out, and put a new bag in.  He always helps with the laundry, as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s three <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; floors down, bringing loads up and down.  He loves dusting, altho <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he&#39;s not very <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thorough. ;-)  Sometimes he negotiates pay for certain jobs, now.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He often <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gets a quarter for helping with the laundry, a quarter for washing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a sink full <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of glasses ( altho the hubby says he&#39;s not too good at reaching <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the bottom of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the glass!  EW), etc.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But this happened from me just asking him to put his own stuff <br/>\n </span></blockquote>away, and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; helping him to organize a little.  He sees me doing certain jobs <br/>\n </span></blockquote>often, and just <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; started helping me with them on his own.  As he got older, he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>started <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; contributing more and more.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last week, when hubby and I weren&#39;t feeling well and we were <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hanging out in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bed, he finished dinner, swept the kitchen floor and cleaned the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>glass coffee <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; table, and he said it was because he wanted me to rest.  I also <br/>\n </span></blockquote>knew that it <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was because he wanted to &quot;take care.&quot;  It was generous of him, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>very sweet.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And totally unnecessary!  lol  Except for the dinner part, that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was awesome.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He baked the biscuits and chopped and added the veggies for the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stew I had <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; started earlier.  I thought it was cute when he told me how much <br/>\n </span></blockquote>work he thought <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that when parents and kids share life in the house, that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; naturally start sharing the work as well.  It&#39;s just that when <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids are young, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they&#39;re too busy playing, and I think that&#39;s the way it should <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be.  Asking, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; suggesting, and talking about cleaning up, tho, makes the child <br/>\n </span></blockquote>aware that it is not <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; magick that puts the legos away, or puts the clothes in the drawer <br/>\n </span></blockquote>clean and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; folded.  ;-)  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;laziness&quot; altho sometimes it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sure seems like <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it is, I know!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, his room is another story. His life is too busy, it&#39;s one <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thing and then <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; another, so I try to understand that&#39;s why the mess develops. ( <br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I don&#39;t <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hang out in there much, so....I don&#39;t see it and don&#39;t care!)  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>He&#39;s just not in <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the habit of putting away.  I&#39;m not going to force him to develop <br/>\n </span></blockquote>those <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; habits, even tho I think they are good ones to have.  He&#39;ll learn <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that or not, on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his own.  It&#39;s not laziness, tho, I don&#39;t (CAN&#39;T) think of it that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>way, or I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get resentful and he doesn&#39;t need that!  I help him straighten up <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a little very <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; few days, and he&#39;s grateful, but it&#39;s his space so it&#39;s up to him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>how it looks <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and where he puts stuff.  It works out well that way.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this helped a little, didn&#39;t mean to let this get so long, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wanted to share my story about how things developed as my son got <br/>\n </span></blockquote>older, because he <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; was a lot like you describe your 5 yo when he was that age.  It <br/>\n </span></blockquote>gets better, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; not worse, as they get older.

Kirby needs to drive <br/>\nan hour in the dark.&quot;    She said she had been trying to ask me to fix her <br/>\nsome protein food because she had a terrible headache.  She wanted beans and <br/>\ncheese on a tortilla.  &quot;But I can get it myself,&quot; she said really sadly, and I <br/>\nzoomed away, but felt guilty.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby works less than a mile from the house.  I asked him to call Holly and <br/>\ntell her we&#39;d be right back to make her food.  He said he wanted some too <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was sweetly thrilled when we got there, and Marty came out to see what <br/>\nall the bustle was.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe four of us all pitched in to do these grated cheese/bean/dip in sour <br/>\ncream things for Holly and Kirby.  Everybody was doing something, and the kitchen <br/>\nwas crowded, but we weren&#39;t bumping and grumpy.  I asked HOlly if she could <br/>\nput the silverware away because the dishwasher is right by that drawer and <br/>\nnobody was in that corner.  &quot;Sure!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe got her food and took it in her room, and I asked Marty to see if she had <br/>\ngotten milk.   &quot;Sure!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe came out and said &quot;I knew I forgot something!&quot;<br/>\nMarty offered to get it for her, so she fed the dog while he was doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had lots of chores and rules, I think (from experiences when I was <br/>\nlittle, and other families I&#39;ve known) there would have been a lot of &quot;It&#39;s not my <br/>\nturn&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s her milk&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s Marty&#39;s dog,&quot; but there was not one <br/>\nnegative second in that whole fifteen minute flurry of crowded activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Kirby and I went out so he could drive in the dark for an hour, which <br/>\ncompletes his supervised practice chart, and he gets his license next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we hadn&#39;t gone back home, Holly would have felt abandoned (and the food <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make her headache go away, so she probably would have cried, too), Kirby <br/>\nwould&#39;ve been driving hungry, and I would have felt guilty about leaving Holly <br/>\nwith her sad headachy face.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Responsibilities/Chores","postDate":"1063816401","msgId":80774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYzUwMWMzN2Q0NyRhY2M1Y2NhMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGJrOGVzOCt2ZWE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":80771,"nextInTopic":80781,"prevInTime":80773,"nextInTime":80775,"topicId":80664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"leschke@shaw.ca Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. - Ralph Waldo Emerson ...

That would add stress, dontcha think?  And, he&#39;s only 5!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would just continue to ask him to do little things I would add asking him <br/>\nto put his shoes away, and other little stuff that *he&#39;s* left out.  If you get <br/>\na lot of no&#39;s on his own stuff, I would talk out loud about it as you clean <br/>\nit up, asking him questions about where he would like it, etc.  It&#39;ll give him <br/>\nan awareness of how much mess he made without being shamed or pressured.  I <br/>\nwould ask if he needs help putting something bigger or messier away, kinda <br/>\nhinting that it needs to be done, but not make a big deal if he wants to leave it <br/>\nout for a while, or if he&#39;s busy.  Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done, anyway, so <br/>\nthat&#39;s my two cents. lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not chore people here.  I&#39;m a reformed slob, so I&#39;ve gotten pretty <br/>\nregimented as I clean and organize.  We bought a new place last year, and we moved <br/>\nfrom a grimey basement apt to a beautiful new condo, so I got very motivated <br/>\nto schedule ( or at least pay attention to how often things got done) my <br/>\nhousework.  But if I don&#39;t wash the floor on tuesday, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Maybe <br/>\ntuesday was a crappy day, or I was tired or busy, or we were out.  If I have that <br/>\nkind of flexibility, why should I be rigid about a chore schedule for my son? <br/>\n  I&#39;ve read about charts and stars, etc, and that kind of thing just makes my <br/>\nskin crawl! lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it also means that a lot of times I want to vacuum and I find a pile of <br/>\ntoys on the floor, or I want to dust and there&#39;s a project on the table, and if <br/>\nI ask my 9 yo if he&#39;s done for now, or if he could put that away so I can <br/>\nclean, he almost always does that, or plays with it somewhere else.  It involves <br/>\nhim somewhat but the line is his own stuff, he knows what he needs to do, but <br/>\nthat I&#39;ll do it if he&#39;s busy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe does help out an awful lot, if I ask him, and more and more, even when I <br/>\ndon&#39;t. If the sink is empty, he&#39;s likely to wash his plate or bowl, because he <br/>\nknows I like an empty sink.  If there&#39;s a bag of garbage, he&#39;ll often take it <br/>\nout, and put a new bag in.  He always helps with the laundry, as it&#39;s three <br/>\nfloors down, bringing loads up and down.  He loves dusting, altho he&#39;s not very <br/>\nthorough. ;-)  Sometimes he negotiates pay for certain jobs, now.  He often <br/>\ngets a quarter for helping with the laundry, a quarter for washing a sink full <br/>\nof glasses ( altho the hubby says he&#39;s not too good at reaching the bottom of <br/>\nthe glass!  EW), etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this happened from me just asking him to put his own stuff away, and <br/>\nhelping him to organize a little.  He sees me doing certain jobs often, and just <br/>\nstarted helping me with them on his own.  As he got older, he started <br/>\ncontributing more and more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, when hubby and I weren&#39;t feeling well and we were hanging out in <br/>\nbed, he finished dinner, swept the kitchen floor and cleaned the glass coffee <br/>\ntable, and he said it was because he wanted me to rest.  I also knew that it <br/>\nwas because he wanted to &quot;take care.&quot;  It was generous of him, and very sweet.  <br/>\nAnd totally unnecessary!  lol  Except for the dinner part, that was awesome.  <br/>\nHe baked the biscuits and chopped and added the veggies for the stew I had <br/>\nstarted earlier.  I thought it was cute when he told me how much work he thought <br/>\nit was!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that when parents and kids share life in the house, that they <br/>\nnaturally start sharing the work as well.  It&#39;s just that when kids are young, <br/>\nthey&#39;re too busy playing, and I think that&#39;s the way it should be.  Asking, <br/>\nsuggesting, and talking about cleaning up, tho, makes the child aware that it is not <br/>\nmagick that puts the legos away, or puts the clothes in the drawer clean and <br/>\nfolded.  ;-)  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;laziness&quot; altho sometimes it sure seems like <br/>\nit is, I know!  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, his room is another story. His life is too busy, it&#39;s one thing and then <br/>\nanother, so I try to understand that&#39;s why the mess develops. ( And I don&#39;t <br/>\nhang out in there much, so....I don&#39;t see it and don&#39;t care!)  He&#39;s just not in <br/>\nthe habit of putting away.  I&#39;m not going to force him to develop those <br/>\nhabits, even tho I think they are good ones to have.  He&#39;ll learn that or not, on <br/>\nhis own.  It&#39;s not laziness, tho, I don&#39;t (CAN&#39;T) think of it that way, or I <br/>\nget resentful and he doesn&#39;t need that!  I help him straighten up a little very <br/>\nfew days, and he&#39;s grateful, but it&#39;s his space so it&#39;s up to him how it looks <br/>\nand where he puts stuff.  It works out well that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helped a little, didn&#39;t mean to let this get so long, but I <br/>\nwanted to share my story about how things developed as my son got older, because he <br/>\nwas a lot like you describe your 5 yo when he was that age.  It gets better, <br/>\nnot worse, as they get older.

(GOTTA have a clean kitchen...my own little specialty, I <br/>\nguess) However, clutter gets on my nerves. However, I used to ignore <br/>\nit until it got awful, then holler at the kids to do it.

Now that I <br/>\nhave taken on the chores without negativity, my kids go for it much <br/>\nmore readily. I ask &quot;would you please?&quot; and usually they do.

Her <br/>\nhouse is always a mess. I am NOT passing judgment here, just stating <br/>\nfacts. I&#39;ve seen her carpet look like the floor of a car, cereal and <br/>\nmilk spilled across a counter top and drying in place, etc. Really <br/>\nmessy. The friend gets asked to clean up, on a regular basis. <br/>\nSometimes, my daughter and her friend can&#39;t get together because <br/>\nfriend&#39;s room is a mess and must be clean before she can go out. When <br/>\nfriend is asked to clean up, she doesn&#39;t do it. plain and simple. <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, she doesn&#39;t do it, because cleaning is never modeled to her.

It looks the <br/>\nsame as her house did, when all those non-helpful men were around. <br/>\nIOW, she doesn&#39;t keep up with the housework, and it shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nsurprise her if her family didn&#39;t...she never modeled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids help without having a chore chart, usually I need to ask <br/>\nthem; sometimes they take the initiative.

Since unschooling and coming to this list our family has done away with the &quot;family meeting&quot; we had every week where we did fun things like giving each other compliments and planning dates but also discussed problems and agreed on chores.  It has been such a relief to do away with the chore chart.  My boys do offer to help (at 6 and 3) and love to vacuum and mop (I detest mopping).  They don&#39;t always want to clean up after playing so I do it with or for them. They sometimes help when asked and sometimes don&#39;t.  I am becoming more and more O.K. with the times they don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember thinking as a child, &quot;If only she (my mother) wouldn&#39;t ask me to do the dusting or dish washing (0r whatever it was) I would do it on my own.&quot; I told her this and she didn&#39;t believe me.  But I remember that feeling so well.  When we create something ourselves, (as opposed to being pushed or led into it) we don&#39;t destroy it.  This includes creatively serving one another and giving back to those we love. My 6 yr. old proudly made us lunch today, unasked. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been all that enthusiastic about house cleaning and I really believe it&#39;s because of my mother&#39;s expectations about it. My husband loves to clean (truly, he does  :)) and his experience growing up was this - he &quot;played&quot; at cleaning up every week with his siblings and the house cleaner. It was a game the kids initiated.  I now see that forcing the chores would be as wrong as forcing the curriculum.  I believe they learn responsibility through our modeling and through being in touch with their own inner compassion.  Of course, sometimes I wish they had more consistent access to that iner compassion cavity!  I just know that my chore charts(and rules) will create big road blocks in their journey there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

But we&#39;ve totally changed what that means due to <br/>\nunschooling. We have seven people in the family and we make <br/>\nbig messes. The kids agreed (in dialog with us) that something <br/>\norganized would make living together better than nothing. So we <br/>\nhave divvied up the way we get the house cleaned. But we&#39;ve <br/>\ntaken their input seriously and have made big changes in <br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one does a job that brings him/her to tears (we&#39;ve seen that). <br/>\nIf someone is really pressed, has an opportunity or is simply <br/>\nhaving a bad week, the cleaning task slides and someone else <br/>\npicks up the slack. For the ones who struggle, we pitch in and do <br/>\nhalf (parents do this).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see chores as responsbility training ground. I see caring <br/>\nrelationships as the primary responsiblity of family members. If <br/>\nthere are coerced chores, caring isn&#39;t often on the map or radar <br/>\nscreen. Chores get top billing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we move chores into the category of more opportunities to <br/>\ncare for one another, then taking humans seriously becomes <br/>\nmore important than clean bathrooms or mowed lawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, we&#39;ve had a much more relaxed approach to <br/>\nchores since January. We saw amazing amounts of growth in <br/>\nthe first few months (kids volunteering to set the table or hand <br/>\nwash dishes or sweep when they had only ever done what was <br/>\nrequired before). But recently, I&#39;ve noticed an even more <br/>\nsignifcant change: Consideration!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy teens have become considerate people right before my very <br/>\neyes. They say the most amazing things: &quot;Mom, I know you&#39;re <br/>\ntired and have driven me everywhere. Why don&#39;t yo go to bed and <br/>\nI&#39;ll get those dishes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: &quot;Mom, Dad&#39;s out of town. You have a lot going tomorrow. If <br/>\nyou want me to come and help you out, I will.&quot; (This formerly <br/>\noblivious daughter then came with me at 9 a.m. on her sleep-in <br/>\nday to work in the snack shack at a soccer game for two hours <br/>\nand to play with younger siblings while I worked. I remain <br/>\nstunned.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: &quot;Can I make lunch? You always do it for everyone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: &quot;I&#39;ll take the largest section for lawn mowing.&quot; (Why? comes <br/>\nto mind... maybe to be nice! Yes I think so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint is: coercing chores makes it impossible for kids to offer <br/>\ntheir acts of service as gifts of generosity.

My 10 yo ds and 6 yo dd each<br/>\nhave 2-3 things they are responsible for.  2.5 yo ds tries to jump in here<br/>\nand there as he can.  Sometimes we use a timer to motivate us for 10 minute<br/>\nwork segments and alternating break times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number one thing that makes it work is that we are all--myself<br/>\nincluded--working at the same time.  I think one thing that made me resent<br/>\nchores so much as a child was the sense that I was being forced to do the<br/>\nunpleasant jobs my parents didn&#39;t want to do and had no option about what to<br/>\ndo.  My kid brother did the &quot;boy&quot; chores and I did the &quot;girl&quot; chores (ever<br/>\nnotice there are more of the latter than the former?).  Meanwhile my parents<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do routine housecleaning chores at all.    My allowance was<br/>\ncontingent on adequate completion of chores by week&#39;s end, but I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nchoose to forgo a given chore, even if I was willing to forgo a portion of<br/>\nmy allowance, until my senior year in high school.  That year I decided to<br/>\ndrop *all* chores outside of cleaning my own room and bathroom.  I had a<br/>\n$50/week job, so the hassle of chores I hated was no longer worth the<br/>\n$15/week I earned doing chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children do get weekly allowances.  I try to keep the allowances<br/>\nseparated from the chores.  Ideally, the idea is you do chores because you<br/>\nare a member of the family and you get allowances because you are a member<br/>\nof the family.  I do encourage the completion of chores as a prerequisite to<br/>\nbeing free to have some fun activity (i.e., we need to do our chores before<br/>\nwe can go to the park this afternoon).  That&#39;s more of a work-before-play<br/>\nthing, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have input on which chores they do.  (Plus their respective ages<br/>\nlimit what they&#39;re able to do at present.)  I feel it&#39;s not appropriate or<br/>\nhelpful to a future householder to just say it should be a child&#39;s choice<br/>\nwhether or not to help with household management.  In families things *do*<br/>\nhave to get done--we can&#39;t just decide not take out the trash or wash the<br/>\nlaundry.  The choice comes in how the child will help.  (And yes, I do think<br/>\nthat should have applied to me as a teen--was it right that I could decide<br/>\nto ditch all chores just because I could earn more money working outside the<br/>\nhome?  It would have been a lot better if my folks had made a list of all<br/>\nthe chores that needed to get done in the week and let us all divvy them<br/>\nup--perhaps I would have enjoyed mowing the yard on the riding mower,<br/>\nsomething my brother loathed, and I know I would have rather he cleaned his<br/>\nown pee-spills up in the bathroom than that being my job!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nPenny<br/>\n<br/>\n-------<br/>\nPenny Piercy, MA, MLS, MSTie, MRS, and MOM<br/>\nliving and learning in Magnolia, TX, USA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159022987,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;mccluskieo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Responsibilities/Chores","postDate":"1063762631","msgId":80683,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJrOGRzNytobDF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzOWIwMWMzN2NhZiQyZjFmMzA0MCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":80680,"nextInTopic":80688,"prevInTime":80682,"nextInTime":80684,"topicId":80664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We are struggling with this idea ourselves.
