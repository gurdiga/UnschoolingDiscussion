I think this is great! And its about time! My problem with this was<br/>\n&gt; that my then 4-5 yr old never wants to wait until the rest of us are finished,<br/>\n&gt; and is always trying to unlock the door. Therefore, my potty breaks have<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; been done as quickly as the consumption of my food during a lunch break. I<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; wish I had the energy level that kids do. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18615,"nextTopicId":18677}}
