I guess that just hasn&#39;t been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if its not necessarily the schools, but whether they feel safe to *be* kids wherever they happen to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to confess that my 7-8 year old LOVES to play house and plays babies.  And she will play barbies sometimes, but she prefers brat dolls instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 year old definitely does look and act older than she is but she also has her moments of cuddle time with mom, and just talking and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey *all* (psers too) play tag in the yard...and this is a cute one:  they all got the old play kitchen out last summer and ALL of them played restaurant, even those who were 13 and 14 at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, maybe its not so much the kids or the schools, but the environment they are in at the moment, or the example of the adults in the environment.  I know my best friend runs a rec program in a nearby town, and almost all of the kids are psers.  But they all come voluntarily to this program, and suddenly all cliques from school disappear and they play ball, and make crafts, and mix crowds.  VERY often the kids tell her that although they really *like* a certain friend, it is not possible for them to be friends outside of the rec program, (in school).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house has evolved into a kind of rec program like that.  Everyone comes over and they play games or play on the computer or watch tv or whatever.  The ps friends ask me to play chess with them.  And they go outside at night and they all play &quot;flashlight&quot; hide and seek in the summers.  Everyone sleds here too, or builds snow stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I know *my* kids are happy to be homeschooling if only because they can be friends with anyone they want and not worry about what others think on the playground.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n  //////////////////----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Mary <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 13, 2003 6:20 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] smoking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;Have A Nice Day!&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t agree that they don&#39;t like to do fun stuff.

The topic hasn&#39;t come up <br/>\nagain, but my husband and I were talking about it and decided neither of us <br/>\nare comfortable allowing our kids to smoke.  We&#39;re just trying to find a way <br/>\nto talk about it without making it a &#39;forbidden fruit&#39;.  Hopefully, we can <br/>\nfigure it out befor it comes up again. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n***What if it were sex at say 8?***<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, we have already been through this, sort of.  None of the kids have <br/>\nmentioned an interest in sex, as far as actually having it anyway, but we <br/>\nhave always talked about sex in our home.  From the beginning, we explained <br/>\nit as a loving act between adults that love, respect and consent to one <br/>\nanother, although not in such stuffy language. ;)  Nicholette is my only <br/>\nchild that ever brings it up but she does tell me she can&#39;t wait to be a <br/>\ngrown up so she can have sex and get a baby girl in her tummy with pink <br/>\nribbons in her hair. LOL  We smile and tell her somehwere, there is a little <br/>\nboy growing up just like her who wants to be her babies&#39; Daddy when HE&#39;S <br/>\ngrown up and we can&#39;t wait to meet him.  (She loves that one. &lt;bg&gt;)  So <br/>\nthat&#39;s actually been pretty simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n***When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe <br/>\ntomorrow&quot;,<br/>\nwhen she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I smoke now?&quot;  I<br/>\nwould just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking tomorrow.  She<br/>\nsoon grew tired of that conversation and took to &quot;smoking&quot; crayons. <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem with this, for me, would be that my kids would be very mad <br/>\nat me for lying to them and I wouln&#39;t blame them.  They are aware of what <br/>\ntomorrow means and I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything to break the trust we <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Best of luck with your daughter, sometimes we just feel our way through <br/>\nit.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, I think I made it a much bigger deal than it really was.  I said my <br/>\nlittle bit of calm peace and it went away.  I think that worked out to be <br/>\nthe best for us.  I&#39; sure a lot of it had to do with the fact that I told <br/>\nthem I&#39;d needed time to think about it and we would talk tomorrow.  (The day <br/>\nafter it happened.)  My kids are very in tune with me and know that I&#39;m very <br/>\nserious if I say that.

As far as the smoking, do you<br/>\nreally think that your 6 yo would really like smoking? I can&#39;t really imagine that. I was<br/>\na social smoker in college (only occasionally when I had been drinking...we smoked menthols<br/>\nLOL!) Part of the appeal was doing something &quot;bad&quot;. I have to say that I did not like waking<br/>\nup with smoke breath in the morning. I just can not see what a 6 yo would see as appealing<br/>\nin smoking...it tastes yucky, makes you cough and smell bad. Kind of scary to think about<br/>\ntrying out that theory though, huh? ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been thinking about something similar. My 6 yo seems occasionally curious about <br/>\nalcohol. It has been mentioned in some books we have read and we do occasionally have<br/>\na drink with dinner or in the evening. We have had talks about how it makes people <br/>\nact different and affects your judgment but that some people like to use it to relax. <br/>\nHe has had sips of beer and did not like it. But he did try some of my Mike&#39;s Hard <br/>\nLemonade and loved it. Asked for some the next day (we did not have any so I did not <br/>\nhave to figure out what to say). But it got me thinking...would I really let my 6 yo <br/>\ndrink a whole bottle? Would I let him get drunk? I would be comfortable letting older <br/>\nkids (maybe older then 10 not sure why that age, but that is what comes to mind??) have <br/>\nsome, but 6? But then I would worry about making it too attractive by saying no.<br/>\nWould a 6 yo like getting drunk? Would it be ok if he did? Or would it scare him? Still <br/>\nworking on this one. For now, I just don&#39;t drink Mike&#39;s around him. It is not like <br/>\nwe drink that much even so it is not a big deal, but still interesting to ponder. Of course <br/>\nmy 3 yo really liked his sip of beer (and really likes his rescue remedy (which has an <br/>\nalcohol base)) so we will have to see where that one goes!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe interesting thing is that a month or so ago, Jason found shockwave.com. They have<br/>\nsome really neat games there, but they also have some realistic shooting games. This<br/>\nwas his first intro to these type of games. He found one that I really did not like<br/>\nbut I did not say no. In fact I was getting ready to post a question here about how<br/>\nto approach it (I was not going to say he could not play it but wanted to try to <br/>\nfigure out how to explain to him what I did not like about it - it was one of those<br/>\ngames where you are behind the gun and go around shooting people who start spurting<br/>\nblood). But before I could post, I realized that he had stopped playing it.

As mentioned, I started smoking when I <br/>\nwas 12 or 13, just one or two here and there when someone offered <br/>\nthem.  On through junior high I would smoke one or two a morning <br/>\nbefore school.  Once in high school, I just didn&#39;t really smoke much <br/>\neven though I hung out with people who did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, I started smoking at a job that I had, mainly to pass <br/>\ntime.  (It was in a bar, so I could smoke all night.)  Plus I liked <br/>\nthe little buzz I got because I didn&#39;t smoke them regularly.  But <br/>\nonce it got to where I was smoking 4 a night (during a 5 or 6 hour <br/>\ntime-span) I decided that I didn&#39;t want it to become a habit, so I <br/>\njust stopped.  Once in a while I will smoke again, but only maybe 4 a <br/>\nweek at most.

Ugh!  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well I guess I am lucky because my daughter (very much UNlike me) is <br/>\na rule follower.  She wants to know what the rules are, and once she <br/>\nknows, she is cool with it.  So if she were to ask to smoke NOW, I <br/>\nwould tell her that it is against the law to smoke until you are 18.  <br/>\n(Or maybe the law is actually that you just can&#39;t BUY them until you <br/>\nare 18, but for now, it is close enough to reality for her.)  So she <br/>\nwould probably just settle it in her mind that she will think about <br/>\nit again when she is 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that would not have been how I would have reacted as a kid.  But <br/>\nin fact, for as wrong as I was led to believe smoking was, I still <br/>\njumped at the chance to do it when I was about 12 or 13.  (But much <br/>\nrebellion had occured during those years, mainly due to my <br/>\nrealization that I had been taught a bunch of crap from a bunch of <br/>\nhypocrites, and that I wanted to be nothing like them.  If smoking is <br/>\nbad, then by golly that is what I am going to do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress...I guess if she were truly hell-bent on smoking at 6, <br/>\neven if I told her about the law, hmm....would I just let her smoke <br/>\none?  Not a puff, the whole thing?  Is that horrible?  I don&#39;t really <br/>\nthink she would like it.  I have let her try my alcoholic drinks <br/>\nbefore, and she really doesn&#39;t much like them except the dacquari&#39;s, <br/>\nbut only the ones that have so little alcohol they really couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nmuch to her.  For as much as I know smoking is bad for you, I also <br/>\nknow that the &quot;coolness&quot; of the forbidden fruit can lead to much <br/>\nworse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo really, that is probably what I would do.  Let her smoke one a <br/>\nday, and count on the fact that it would not last long.  But of <br/>\ncourse, I would teach her HOW to smoke it the RIGHT way...you know, <br/>\nreally inhaling, not just suck in--blow out. (Cough, hack, cough, <br/>\ngasp.)  I just can&#39;t believe she would think it was that great.  And <br/>\nI would think at the younger age, she would be less inclined to <br/>\ndisregard the bad (cough hack) for the &quot;good&quot; (coolness.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also don&#39;t have an older child to worry about.  But the thing <br/>\nis, all you can do (or should do, if they are anything like I was) is <br/>\ntell them the truth about what it does to you and why you wish they <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do it.  If Haleigh is determined to do it, the more <br/>\nnegativity from you, the more she will just be inclined to do it away <br/>\nfrom home, or at least not let the younger ones in on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hesitate to even post this, because I am certainly not telling you <br/>\nthat you ought to do what I THINK I would do in the situation.  These <br/>\nare just my first thoughts, and my first inclinations as to what I <br/>\nwould do based on my knowledge of my daughter.  Sorry to have <br/>\nrambled.

I&#39;m very torn as to how I feel about <br/>\nfully allowing them the freedom to make their own choices and standing <br/>\nbehind their decisions.  That sounds awful, I know.  It&#39;s so much easier <br/>\nwhen they are young and dangerous things aren&#39;t so much of an <br/>\nissue...smoking, drugs, std&#39;s, just to rattle off a few.  Now, if they were <br/>\n16, maybe I might be more inclined to want them to make their own decisions. <br/>\n  It just seems like these things are more difficult for them to understand. <br/>\n  (I hope I&#39;m getting this across as I intend.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of giving them information.  Insight and examples of *why* <br/>\nsmoking is harmful, explore their reasons as to why they wanted to try it <br/>\nand then talk about other things they could have done to satisfy those <br/>\nreasons, *without* smoking.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, they weren&#39;t sitting around <br/>\npuffing away like chimney&#39;s or anything.  As far as I know, they all just <br/>\ntried one puff or so.  I don&#39;t want to make it a huge to-do but I don&#39;t want <br/>\nit to pass by unnoticed either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m working on it.  Trying to sort out all the crap in my head about <br/>\nkids being too young to make well informed decisions, etc.  It seems easier <br/>\nwith my 12 year old, but my 6 yr old is the one I&#39;m really struggling with.  <br/>\nI&#39;m actually glad this happened late in the evening, so it didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nloom over us like a black cloud all day.  LOL...just caught the pun in that. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I&#39;d had all this worked out BEFORE it happened! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

What actually <br/>\nbothers me more is that my mom never stepped in to knock some sense <br/>\ninto me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have told my daughter about the whole smoking issue (she is <br/>\nsix, and we had these discussions over a year ago) is that smoking is <br/>\nsimilar to many other things in life in that too much of it is bad <br/>\nfor you.  (Now don&#39;t attack me here, I know even a little smoking is <br/>\nbad for your lungs, but my goal is to de-mystify it.)  Too much <br/>\nsugary food is not good, too many carrots or too much water can make <br/>\nyou seriously ill.  I am trying to get her to understand moderation.  <br/>\nIt is kind of like lifting restrictions on food and not <br/>\nplacing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; labels on things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe spent several weeks questioning me off an on about smoking, and <br/>\nat first she thought only men smoke.  (Not many people in our lives <br/>\nsmoke...not by choice, just by chance, but the ones who do are men.)  <br/>\nSo I started pointing out women who smoke.  I just want her to see <br/>\nlife as it really is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, one day she told me that when she grows up, she wants to <br/>\ndrive a motorcycle and smoke one cigarette a day.  I said, &quot;Sounds <br/>\ncool.  Will you take me for a ride on your motorcycle?&quot;  She <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Sure!&quot;  I have heard no mention of cigarettes since. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTory</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40256956,"authorName":"jmcseals SEALS","from":"&quot;jmcseals SEALS&quot; &lt;jmcseals@...&gt;","profile":"sevenhavei","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] smoking","postDate":"1052629671","msgId":68539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjhiMXM3bmxUMk5xRkowMDAxMzFlZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68538,"nextInTopic":68541,"prevInTime":68538,"nextInTime":68540,"topicId":11892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree.

You can also tell them that many people (maybe <br/>\nmost?) start smoking when they&#39;re young and impressionable because there is <br/>\nthis &#39;coolness&#39; attached to smoking in our pop culture, but they soon grow <br/>\nto regret it when they try to quit but are not able to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I would also tell my son that there are certain things that he may <br/>\ndo that I might not want him to do, and that I really cannot stop <br/>\nhim.

He may want to try smoking (but I doubt it <br/>\n&#39;cause I&#39;ve given him a lot of bad press about it, and he&#39;s not at all <br/>\nimpressed with people who smoke), and then he may decide that it&#39;s <br/>\ndisgusting and stop.  But, I told him my story, which was that I started <br/>\nsmoking at the age of 13 because all my friends smoked and I wanted to be <br/>\ncool and included.  I told him how I had to smoke a whole pack of <br/>\ncigarettes one night to get past the dizziness and nausea and that it was <br/>\nreally disgusting.
