Up to one third of youngsters (sometimes more) do well enough at school to go on to tertiary education and professional jobs. The remainder leave school with the notion that they are indeed &#39;stupid&#39;. This self-image stays with them for the rest of their lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why teaching thinking for just five hours to unemployed youngsters on the Government New Deal programme increased the employment rate five hundred per cent. These youngsters suddenly realised they were not stupid at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why all schools should teach thinking and operacy as a core subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nEdward de Bono Author, &quot;The Six Thinking Hats&quot;<br/>\n5th January 2003<br/>\nFrance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74042,"nextTopicId":74049}}
