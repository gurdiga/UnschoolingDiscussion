Well, \nnot really , my oldest is 28 with children older than her sister. I&#39;m 48 myself \nand had not encountered any &quot;baby boomer&quot; moms with young homeschoolers. sherry, \nhave you thought of developing a new interest, something perhaps you always \nwanted to learn but never had the time before. After years as an RN,and \nsuffering from severe burn out, I dropped out of the work force, re-evaliated my \nlife and proceeded to start over. during this recouping phase, found myself \nunexpectedly, &quot;expecting&quot; and thus begun this wonderful and creative phase of my \nlife. I found that I had interests and talents I never knew I had, took up oil \npainting with a passion. Now, at age five, daughter is developing her own \ncreative pursuits right along side Mom. sherry, I would say take some \n&quot;reflective&quot; time. I know deep down there&#39;s a yearning to do something that \nperhaps you always felt you couldn&#39;t or circumstances wouldn&#39;t let you. \nRenée</font></div>\n<div><font face=\"Sans\" size=\"4\">Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one \nless traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
