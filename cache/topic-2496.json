If find that more unsettling than I&#39;m<br/>\nready to deal with I suppose.  I can&#39;t see the next step if I toss the text<br/>\nbook. Is that any more clear?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;How do I make sure that they get all they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; need in math with unschooling &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, how were you going to be sure with a textbook? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As magical as they &#39;are&#39; &lt;VBG&gt; I&#39;ve met the wrong answers.  They don&#39;t<br/>\nbother me.  I just explain that the books are done by people and we all<br/>\nmake mistakes.  BUT, the textbook supplies me with the outline of what,<br/>\ni.e., 2 digit multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, geometry (they<br/>\ncould leave that one out as far as I&#39;m concerned :o)  and the steps that<br/>\nget the kids to the understanding of how to do these things.  I don&#39;t see<br/>\nhow they learn long division unschooling.  Hope that helps.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  This sometimes means that their time<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;table will be vasty skewed from the public school time table, which can be<br/>\n&gt;uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find that very uncomfortable.  My own mother died young thus I think of<br/>\nthese things.  And in my first year attempt (just starting year 2) of hsing<br/>\nI had to consider what approach I would take in each subject to keep the<br/>\nkids at a point where no subject would be an albatross during a time where<br/>\nthey already had enough to deal with, specifically the loss of any parent.<br/>\nThat loss is enough in and of itself.  To be burdened with an extra problem<br/>\nof not being where they need to be in a subject, whether it be English<br/>\nGrammar, Spelling or Math is something I don&#39;t want to put my kids through.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you die, their ability to do math in concert with some public school<br/>\n&gt;classroom will be the least of their concerns.  Living in fear isn&#39;t a great<br/>\n&gt;way to live.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really live in fear of this I&#39;m just aware that none of us have any<br/>\npromise of tomorrow or even later today.  I look at it more as a reason<br/>\nbehind my choices.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;Another concern I have is once they learn what they need to know is it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; hard for them to put it down on paper or do they know what to do with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; problems on paper if/when they encounter them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m not following you here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, let me try again.  Does unschooling teach a child to recognize the<br/>\nmathematic symbols used in textbooks?  From the unschoolers I&#39;ve known math<br/>\nis mostly mental math - which is great - yet I don&#39;t see where they<br/>\nexperience the math sentence and different layouts of mathematic problems<br/>\non paper.  I would think this could potentially cause a problem at some<br/>\npoint would it not?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI once worked with a guy (ps high school grad) that couldn&#39;t count to 5 let<br/>\nalone write a sensible math statement.  Talk about scary!  This kid (18 or<br/>\n19) couldn&#39;t even count items from one box to another - he must have never<br/>\nused manipulatives.  LOL  It was scary to me to think that any 18-19 yo<br/>\ncould be so unknowledgeable in basic math.  This it is possible for a child<br/>\nto end up in such a state.  Obviously this is an extreme in life, not one<br/>\nthat many will experience but I want to be sure my children can read and<br/>\nwrite math problems in such a way as to be employable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;School Math ruins Real Math.  There are mathie types on the list that will<br/>\n&gt;do justice to what math really is. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK so what is Real Math?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  And not everyone has<br/>\n&gt;to do math first thing, they can ride the rollercoaster first, then<br/>\n&gt;somewhere around 13-14 they can work on math. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So you are saying that ages 13-14 is where math should begin?  Thus<br/>\nentering into the algebras, trigs, geometry, etc.?  Then where is the<br/>\nchild&#39;s base?  Math like any other subject must have a foundation.  When<br/>\ndid they learn multiplication (note I didn&#39;t say memorize the entire<br/>\nmultiplication table) and division, fractions, decimals, etc.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Did ya ever go anywhere with someone who wanted to see ALL the sights and<br/>\n&gt;ride ALL the rides??  Did ya notice they spent so much time trying to cram<br/>\n&gt;everything in they forgot to have fun?  Don&#39;t do that to your homeschooling<br/>\n&gt;adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ooops!  Maybe that&#39;s the problem - I&#39;m the guy trying to see all the sites<br/>\nand ride all the rides!  I don&#39;t want to miss anything! :o)  I smile but I<br/>\nreally am the kind of person that does just what you wrote.  Although from<br/>\nmy perspective I still have fun, just not with reckless abandon.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now I have to go back to writing the stuff I was writing, cause I need to.<br/>\n&gt;But this was a whole lot more fun. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lisa,  Thanks for taking the time to respond.  I enjoyed this too.  Some of<br/>\nmy questions are perhaps not worded quite right just yet as I&#39;m still<br/>\nunraveling my concerns - kind of thinking out loud.  But give me time and<br/>\nI&#39;ll eventually figure out exactly what it is I&#39;m trying to say boggles me<br/>\nabout this subject.

Somehow I can see it coming<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us but it scares me to death.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t be scared!  You know the ps didn&#39;t work in the first place, so now<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; have the freedom to try anything and everything.

Those texts were written by humans, so they are magical.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a secret here and it&#39;s hard to believe at first.....but you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to be sure they will get all they need.   THEY will be sure they get<br/>\n&gt; what they need, because the NEED it.   This sometimes means that their<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; table will be vasty skewed from the public school time table, which can be<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;and be sure they would not be thrown for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; loop if, God forbid, a truck hit me head on and they were thrown back<br/>\ninto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ps? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you die, their ability to do math in concert with some public school<br/>\n&gt; classroom will be the least of their concerns.

Our kids use real life, need to solve real<br/>\nlife<br/>\n&gt; problems, writing them down to sort them out is one option.  Thankfully<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; not the only option.  I create many word problems......but I rarely write<br/>\n&gt; them out. I TALK them out.  There are members of this list snorting about<br/>\n&gt; now, as they have tried to sort out my written problems.  It&#39;s better to<br/>\n&gt; call me on the phone. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now what do I do when I encounter a written problem, or something to sort<br/>\n&gt; out?  I go read it out loud to myself or I have my dh read it.  I  talk<br/>\n&gt; through my answer and THEN I write it out.  Sort of.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; School Math ruins Real Math.  There are mathie types on the list that will<br/>\n&gt; do justice to what math really is.  Just rest assured that out unschooled<br/>\n&gt; kids *get* and *do* math just fine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My one dd, age 10, had a horrible time in ps with math and now has a<br/>\n&gt; bushel<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of attitudes to show for it.  This makes it hard - I know she is already<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behind where she would be in ps and I don&#39;t want her to lose any more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ground.  Suggestions welcome!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First put away all those Shoulds. They are a false set of ideas.  Should<br/>\nall<br/>\n&gt; 3 month olds be able to sit up? 6 month olds?  When should all babies be<br/>\n&gt; walking?  If we know enough not to put our babies on a timetable, why do<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; think all 9 year olds ought to understand multiplication or all 13 year<br/>\nolds<br/>\n&gt; should be introduced to algebra??  Each child has his or her own time<br/>\n&gt; table. Cognitive growth comes in spurts just like physical growth.  We<br/>\n&gt; should wait for it and enjoy it when it happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a 5 year old that just sounded out her first word a couple of days<br/>\n&gt; ago. She&#39;s spending tons of time trying to read everything that comes her<br/>\n&gt; way.  Her 7.5 year old brother hasn&#39;t discovered the existance of the<br/>\n&gt; alphabet yet.  Wait.. he knows on and off and ok and a few other words<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; appear on his video games. Otherwise that son exists in a word of things.<br/>\n&gt; Things to do, things to take apart, things to break, things to talk about.<br/>\n&gt; No words and no reading allowed, at least not yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Losing ground can&#39;t be done.  Think of learning as a huge amusement park.<br/>\n&gt; Lots of rides, shows and sights to see. It matters not what you do first<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; how many times you choose to do the same thing. It only matters that you<br/>\n&gt; take care of yourself while there and that you explore until your heart is<br/>\n&gt; content.  Some of us will hone in and only ride the very fast, daredevil<br/>\n&gt; rollercoasters. Some will only see the shows.  We all will have a great<br/>\ntime<br/>\n&gt; and feel we got out money&#39;s worth.  Not everyone has to ride the<br/>\n&gt; rollercoaster and not everyone has to be a math whiz.  And not everyone<br/>\nhas<br/>\n&gt; to do math first thing, they can ride the rollercoaster first, then<br/>\n&gt; somewhere around 13-14 they can work on math. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Did ya ever go anywhere with someone who wanted to see ALL the sights and<br/>\n&gt; ride ALL the rides??  Did ya notice they spent so much time trying to cram<br/>\n&gt; everything in they forgot to have fun?  Don&#39;t do that to your<br/>\nhomeschooling<br/>\n&gt; adventure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now I have to go back to writing the stuff I was writing, cause I need to.<br/>\n&gt; But this was a whole lot more fun. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lisa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS!

What if the textbook<br/>\nleft something out,or didn&#39;t stress it enough or was just plain wrong about<br/>\nsomething? Those texts were written by humans, so they are magical.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a secret here and it&#39;s hard to believe at first.....but you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be sure they will get all they need.   THEY will be sure they get<br/>\nwhat they need, because the NEED it.

Our kids use real life, need to solve real life<br/>\nproblems, writing them down to sort them out is one option.  Thankfully it&#39;s<br/>\nnot the only option.  I create many word problems......but I rarely write<br/>\nthem out. I TALK them out.  There are members of this list snorting about<br/>\nnow, as they have tried to sort out my written problems.  It&#39;s better to<br/>\ncall me on the phone. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what do I do when I encounter a written problem, or something to sort<br/>\nout?  I go read it out loud to myself or I have my dh read it.  I  talk<br/>\nthrough my answer and THEN I write it out.  Sort of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool Math ruins Real Math.

Somehow I can see it coming for<br/>\n&gt; us but it scares me to death.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes it still scares me to death,  but I love it anyway :-)  We <br/>\nstarted unschooling our son in 5th grade.  We started with a variety <br/>\nof resources, not a specific curriculum,  but a lot of schoolish <br/>\nideas.  Within the first week,  my son would question why we were <br/>\ndoing this or that.  What was he learning.  I begin to question it <br/>\ntoo.  Plus,  I figured out really quickly that he was forgetting the <br/>\nthings he wasn&#39;t interested in.  Within a couple of months we were <br/>\ndoing math,  a little writing,  plenty of free-choice reading, and <br/>\nunschooling the rest of the time.  Then I saw that the little bit of <br/>\nmath I was still &quot;assigning&quot; was becoming very tedious.  We were <br/>\nusing Saxon and even leaving out a lot,  there was too much <br/>\nrepetition.  He began to dread math and he had always loved it, and <br/>\nreally understood it.  All the while,  I had been reading everything <br/>\nI could get my hands on about unschooling and sharing it with dh.<br/>\nHe&#39;s a college professor that sees on a daily basis what&#39;s happening <br/>\nto education.  Anyway,  we finally decided to go for it.  We felt <br/>\nlike if we only stuck our toe in intead of jumping in completely,  we <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be able to convince our son that he really was in charge of <br/>\nhis education and that it was his choice from now on.  <br/>\nIt took a while - quite a bit of deschooling to do,  but he&#39;s such a <br/>\nbeliever now that I can&#39;t imagine going back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I make sure that they get all they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; need in math with unschooling and be sure they would not be thrown for a<br/>\n&gt; loop if, God forbid, a truck hit me head on and they were thrown back into<br/>\n&gt; ps?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling involves a lot of trust.  You have to trust that your <br/>\nchild will learn what he needs to know when he needs to know it.  And <br/>\n- if God forbid something happens,  your child has the benefit of the <br/>\ntime he/she has spent learning on their own - learning how to learn, <br/>\ntrusting themselves - becoming self-directed, independent learners.<br/>\nIf they do go back to school,  it&#39;s with a different attitude.  <br/>\nThey will still take more responsibility for their education instead <br/>\nof expecting the school to have all the right answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of 6th grade,  my son decided that he wanted to try 7th <br/>\ngrade.  He was worried that he might be behind in math so he asked me <br/>\nto help him work throught the rest of a math book at that level.  <br/>\nWell, you can imagine what happened.  He went back,  and they put him <br/>\nin the advanced math class.  He only stayed for one quarter,  but it <br/>\nwas so different from when he had been in school before.  He jumped <br/>\nthrough the hoops that he had to,  but for the most part,  he took <br/>\nwhat he could use and left the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another concern I have is once they learn what they need to know is it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hard for them to put it down on paper or do they know what to do with<br/>\n&gt; problems on paper if/when they encounter them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  For instance, one way to become a good writer is <br/>\nto read a lot.  Areas overlap and strengths make up for weaknesses.<br/>\nPlus,  I think that when you need these skills,  you can practice <br/>\nthem and become proficient rather quickly.  I would imagine that <br/>\nif my son decides to take the ACT or SAT that we will practice because he <br/>\nwon&#39;t have had a lot of experience with standardized tests.  It will <br/>\nbe useful to practice,  but it wouldn&#39;t have been worth it to have <br/>\nhad him take them every year just so that he had the experience.<br/>\nHe does a lot of math in his head that I have to write down.  It&#39;s <br/>\njust different - not good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My one dd, age 10, had a horrible time in ps with math and now has a bushel<br/>\n&gt; of attitudes to show for it.  This makes it hard - I know she is already<br/>\n&gt; behind where she would be in ps and I don&#39;t want her to lose any more<br/>\n&gt; ground.  Suggestions welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know how you feel.  I felt like this when we first took our <br/>\ndaughter out of high school.  Be patient.  It&#39;s more important that <br/>\nshe comes back to math on her own terms.  Then she&#39;ll remember what <br/>\nshe learns and have a chance to enjoy it.  She has the rest of her <br/>\nlife to learn math if she wants to.  It doesn&#39;t matter where she <br/>\n&quot;should&quot; be right now.  When she&#39;s ready,  she&#39;ll be able to learn it <br/>\nso much better and faster than she will now if coerced.  You&#39;ll lose <br/>\nmore ground in the long run if she continues to develop a dislike for <br/>\nmath.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to ramble so!  Hope it helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jeff & Diane Gwirtz","from":"&quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;jagwirtz@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"AZKPihwI2UBoJDaqduSKDQvUWy88un_3S5eOs_FQrAXJjydoDd1k6SG-ie_ntVl-d1rObPjwo-7sm20xUPxCQLt9-wKrrH_-yoDMgO5yCg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling or Eclectic?","postDate":"936388642","msgId":2500,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xODMuMjUwMC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2496,"nextInTopic":2501,"prevInTime":2499,"nextInTime":2501,"topicId":2496,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Today, in fact he was using a geometry <br/>\ntextbook.   We make textbooks available just like we make fiction <br/>\navailable.  Textbooks are a resource at our house and my son uses <br/>\nthem how and when he wants to.  We recently had a discussion here <br/>\nabout the University of Missouri correspondence program - maybe <br/>\nthat&#39;s what you are referring to.  I think that courses like these <br/>\ncan be another unschooling resource, as long as it follows the <br/>\nchild&#39;s interests, goals, and desires.  Last year my son returned to <br/>\nps briefly.  We considered that unschooling because it was what he <br/>\nwanted to do.  We approached it in a very unschoolish fashion and <br/>\nwhen he had gotten what he needed, we moved on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOften, homeschoolers come to unschooling gradually.  First they give <br/>\nup the spelling tests,  then the grammar lesson.  It seems like the <br/>\nlast to go is often the math book.  That&#39;s the way it was with us.<br/>\nAlso,  some families are &quot;eclectic homeschoolers.&quot;  They may use <br/>\ncurriculum for certain subjects and unschool others.  For us though,  <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t work.  Once my kids tasted unschooling,  they wanted it <br/>\nall.  I&#39;d probably still be sitting here happily doling out math <br/>\nassignments,  but they weren&#39;t going for it.  Now,  it&#39;s such a <br/>\npleasure to watch my son (daughter is in college), tackle math <br/>\nbecause he likes it - geometry no less........<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2875,"nextTopicId":2863}}
