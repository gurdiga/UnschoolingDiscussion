My car needs a <br/>\nnew clutch.  The past two mornings, the kids have wanted to come with me, so <br/>\nI brought them along to the church and put them to work.  After work on <br/>\nMonday I took them to the library and we hung out there for quite a while.  <br/>\nToday, I left for work ahead of them, and told them to follow at their own <br/>\npace.  I gave them a scavenger hunt list of things to look for along the way. <br/>\n This way I got about 1/2 hour of work in before they got there, and I felt <br/>\nit was somewhat educational in the sense that they had to read, observe, and <br/>\nwork together as a team.  Okay, okay.... so maybe I&#39;m stretching it just a <br/>\nbit.
