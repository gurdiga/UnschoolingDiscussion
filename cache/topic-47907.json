I&#39;m used to certain levels of actvity and noise and chaos -<br/>\nwe had a party here a few weeks ago with 50+ unschoolers of all ages<br/>\n(spread out over the 3 houses and a few tents on the farm) and while it<br/>\nwas great fun, I also felt frazzled most of the time, and had to keep<br/>\nducking out for some quiet interactions with my anti-social friend and<br/>\nthe ball games. I&#39;m really more of an introvert, and Rain right now seems<br/>\nmuch more extraverted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to do other things - bring food, buy pizza, babysit at their house,<br/>\nrun errands - that are easier for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lots of people tell me how wonderful Rain is, and how much they love<br/>\nhaving her over, and that makes me feel really good. I have one email<br/>\nfriend who I&#39;ve known for almost 7 years now, who apparently knew a lot<br/>\nof only children who didn&#39;t play well with younger siblings, and she<br/>\nassumed that that was typical, and never seemed to believe me when I said<br/>\nRain wasn&#39;t like that. We&#39;ve gotten together a handful of times in person<br/>\nnow, and the last time she told me that her girls (Rain&#39;s age and a few<br/>\nyears older) had told her with some amazement that Rain really *was* good<br/>\nwith younger kids. She had played a game of chess with their younger<br/>\nbrother, and had spent most of the rest of the day with a friend&#39;s 2 year<br/>\nold on her hip. So that felt good... and there were times when she handed<br/>\nme the 2 yr old and quietly mentioned that they were trying to play<br/>\npollies and they were too little for E to play with, and I was happy to<br/>\ntake her out to collect eggs for half an hour or so.

Not only was I not familiar with <br/>\nbabies in general, but I had no friends who had kids her age. All my friends <br/>\nwere older and had started much younger having kids. So Tara was pretty much <br/>\nalone with just adults for her first 4 years. The result was a very vocal <br/>\nand mature child at a very young age. By the age of 2, an adult could <br/>\nactually sit and have a conversation with her. I mean a real converstation. <br/>\nWhen I would take her to a rare occasion where there were other little kids, <br/>\nshe would refuse to play with them. Always said they did stupid stuff that <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t interested in. I took her everywhere with me, but again she was <br/>\nonly around adults. She had one cousin 10 months younger that she played <br/>\nwith at the most, once a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had to send her to preschool, she was teachers pet and refused to <br/>\nplay with the kids. She still tells horror stories of how awful it was. She <br/>\nnever really hung out with kids until like 3rd grade. She considered herself <br/>\na nerd until like 6th grade. Then she started going straight to the I want <br/>\nto be grown up stage. Pretty sad. Now she&#39;s great and very social but she <br/>\nmissed a lot of being a kid. I&#39;m sure some of it was just her personality <br/>\nbut a lot of it was also me screwing up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChoose an Internet access plan right for you -- try MSN! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/default.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124349609,"authorName":"moonlitbatiks","from":"&quot;moonlitbatiks&quot; &lt;moonlitbatiks@...&gt;","profile":"moonlitbatiks","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: only children","postDate":"1035553098","msgId":47937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwYmhnYStjbzgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFwYWpiNCs2bTA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47912,"nextInTopic":47940,"prevInTime":47936,"nextInTime":47938,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I also have a practically only child (13yo half bro visits once a week).

My daughter is 5 years old.  For the past year she has craved <br/>\nsooo much social contact with other kids, that I&#39;ve had a hard time <br/>\nfullfilling her wishes.

Still, it&#39;s a school, and don&#39;t like <br/>\nher having to be around 21 other kids 3 hours a day.  I think it <br/>\nshould be a child&#39;s choice to go to school or not, so though I want <br/>\nto unschool her, I struggle with the decision.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; play with them.

I know parents who <br/>\nhomeschool and don&#39;t expose their children to other adults, and their <br/>\nchildren are socially retarded.  Look at kids who&#39;ve spent there <br/>\nchildhood in daycares around other children.  I know I don&#39;t want my <br/>\ndaughter acting like them either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to question the value of her having lots of time with <br/>\nkids her age.  I think I pushed her into it when she was 3, thinking <br/>\nshe needed to have peer friends, and now I regret it. I wish I had <br/>\nencouraged her to enjoy being by herself more at that age. I think <br/>\nit&#39;s great that she&#39;s outgoing, but I see that she tries too hard to <br/>\nimpress her friends and is not discovering who she is.  I am slowly <br/>\nchanging her mind about school (I can&#39;t imagine she&#39;d like spending 7 <br/>\nhours a day there next year)  and trying to find a small group of <br/>\nhomeschooled children for her to play with.    <br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90421708,"authorName":"katielouba","from":"&quot;katielouba&quot; &lt;LsMe@...&gt;","profile":"katielouba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: only children","postDate":"1035522212","msgId":47912,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFwYWpiNCs2bTA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDI0LjIxMzkxNy4tMjAzNzk3LjMuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47907,"nextInTopic":47937,"prevInTime":47911,"nextInTime":47913,"topicId":47907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
