He was my senior English teacher in high <br/>\nschool. We did all sorts of grueling exercises that I looked back <br/>\non, even as early as a few months after graduation, and realized how <br/>\nuseful the tools we had developed in that class turned out to be for <br/>\ncollege type stuff. We did timed writing - we&#39;d show up in class, <br/>\nput away everything except 2 sheets of paper and a pen, he&#39;d write a <br/>\nsentence or question on the board and we had 15 minutes to rough <br/>\ndraft and final draft a 5 paragraph essay on the topic sentence or <br/>\nquestion, referencing materials we had read in class and elsewhere. <br/>\nPhew those were rough - but then when I had 90 minutes to write an <br/>\nessay for the placement exams at college (the day after I got back <br/>\nfrom 10 days in Spain. Can you say &quot;jet lag&quot;? lol) I finished in <br/>\nunder 30 minutes, leisurely, and went out to catch up with my folks <br/>\nwho were touring around the campus. We also did precis writing - <br/>\nturning 5 paragraphs into 5 to 10 sentences without losing the sense <br/>\nof the essay. That usually took a series of rewrites, each shorter <br/>\nthan the last (in half, half, half again ...). You&#39;d never know it <br/>\nby my posts (lol) but I got really good at that. I found it a unique <br/>\nchallenge, like a jigsaw puzzle, to craft a paragraph or so that <br/>\nconveyed an essay&#39;s worth of information. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat stuff actually did serve me in good stead in my first job - <br/>\nworking for a newsletter in a niche computer industry market, <br/>\nabstracting articles and press releases for the boss to use in his <br/>\narticles and later as a bylined writer in my own right.

How do you help them <br/>\nprepare for formal instruction in general?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not difficult to teach writing formats to anyone who is interested and comfortable <br/>\nexpressing him/herself in writing. If your kids use live journals, spend time emailing or <br/>\nposting on email lists that relate to their interests, they are already doing the kind of <br/>\nwriting that will prepare them for timed essay writing (such as the SAT in 2005 and ACTin <br/>\n2006).<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are college-bound (by choice) will want to prepare. They can take courses online <br/>\n(I happen to teach several) or they can use books to prepare. One little book taht I really <br/>\nlike is called &quot;Daily Writing Warm-ups.&quot; It happens to be in the format that will likely <br/>\ncharacterize the SAT tests. There are quotes from famous people that catalyze a response.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe student&#39;s job is to write about the quote in a way that shows organization and <br/>\npersonal flair.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who read a lot, talk to adults often and who are comfortable expressing themselves in <br/>\nwriting are already far ahead of the average school child and even homeschooled child <br/>\nwho hates writing. If you have a child who doesn&#39;t write (for pleasure or even due to <br/>\nnecessity), then you want to ask your child for his goals and what he is really interested in. <br/>\nWriting instruction can be a real joy (my online classes are so popular with high school <br/>\nstudents because they have the opportunity to write for each other and to really sink their <br/>\nteeth into the writing process in a supportive, conversational, competent atmosphere.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com\">http://www.bravewriter.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119145590,"authorName":"April M","from":"&quot;April M&quot; &lt;abmorris23@...&gt;","profile":"klkb624","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] a question about formal writing &unschooling","postDate":"1094565318","msgId":99229,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5IQkJLT1BDS0xHR0NQQUlOREpETUVOSUZHQUEuYWJtb3JyaXMyM0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJENjMzMkY0LjJCMUIxJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":99226,"nextInTopic":99232,"prevInTime":99228,"nextInTime":99230,"topicId":99210,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have an interesting story about this.

I know that I didn&#39;t really learn to write a good &quot;paper&quot; until I went to college.  I spent much of high school in the parking lot or at the beach myself.  So, I really learned it in Freshman Communications class.  It was a big awakening that I had &quot;somehow&quot; missed what most other students knew.  If you realize your child is college bound, how can you help them learn formal writing, so they don&#39;t go into it not knowing how to follow a scripted planned paper.  Which is what most profs are looking for.  I am new to unschooling, but am learning so much from this group.  This question came up with a friend the other day and I wasn&#39;t sure of the answer myself.  How do you help them prepare for formal instruction in general?<br/>\nLaura J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99659,"nextTopicId":99750}}
