I&#39;m hardly ever home. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went camping in the Big Hole and got evicted because of the threat of<br/>\nfire.  That fire near Wisdom crept to within twenty miles and we were<br/>\nvery smokey.  We had to come out behind a pilot car  - finished up our<br/>\ncamping time at Georgetown. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been doing a lot of hiking in the Pintlars.  Just day hikes, David<br/>\nwas worried about bears and didn&#39;t want Dylan and I alone in our little<br/>\ntent if big, bad Mr. Bear showed up.  Why on earth he thinks a bear is<br/>\nmore dangerous than I am I&#39;ll never know.   Bears don&#39;t eat hikers, only<br/>\ncampers?  Hmm... <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve seen exactly one bear this year, in Refrigerator canyon (over near<br/>\nyou, in that Helena direction) and he was very interested in leaving us<br/>\nto ourselves.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid&#39;s out of work again for a while and MY HECK I&#39;m getting sick of<br/>\nbeans and rice, but I saved enough for a quick trip to Yellowstone<br/>\nsometime this month.   Dylan has a dog sitting job this weekend but after<br/>\nthat we&#39;re free.   It&#39;s thirty dollars a night to pitch a tent in West,<br/>\nwhich is crazy but our tent doesn&#39;t qualify for camping in the park.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ll see some bears at Grizzly discovery center, if no where else. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nWhen I was a foolish teen we used to hitchhike to West Yellowstone and<br/>\nskinny dip in the hot springs and camp FREE anywhere there.   The times<br/>\nthey are a changin&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re off today to Georgetown again if it doesn&#39;t hail and sink us, we<br/>\nshould have some fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154774423,"authorName":"Nichole","from":"&quot;Nichole&quot; &lt;ms_fausey@...&gt;","profile":"pseudonna","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Deb&#39;s dilemma WAS being home all day with kids","postDate":"1060248380","msgId":78066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzIwMWMzNWNjNSRmNjgzNTI2MCQwZTAyYThjMEBGcmVlZG9tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDRkLjMzMjgyYjdjLjJjNjMxZDMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78062,"nextInTopic":78076,"prevInTime":78065,"nextInTime":78067,"topicId":78059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I doubt that any amount of activity is going to make Deb forget about her baby niece.
