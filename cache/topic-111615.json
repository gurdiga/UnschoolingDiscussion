They adopted him as an infant. They  <br/>\nspecifically requested that they not be given a child whose birth  <br/>\nparents were known to have a history of mental illness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeremy grew up near me - was friends with my nephew and other kids I  <br/>\nknow. His family was good and warm and loving. When he exhibited  <br/>\nsigns of mental problems, they took him to counseling. He was  <br/>\nreferred to a psychiatrist who prescribed amphetamines of some kind.  <br/>\nHe got addicted to drugs and he got worse and worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe murdered a little girl in a casino in Las Vegas.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out his mother was, at the time of the adoption, in a mental  <br/>\ninstitution for severe schizophrenia. She&#39;d been hospitalized for  <br/>\nmental illnesses over 60 times. Social workers purposely held back  <br/>\nthat information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that anybody knows if his mental illness was inherited  <br/>\n- but there is clearly that possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my sister adopted her daughter, the social workers did NOT give  <br/>\nher information about what my niece had been through. My sister  <br/>\nslowly got some of it - but she had to piece things together and it  <br/>\nwas very very difficult to try to help her without knowing her history.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh - which reminds me of another reason why unschooling might be  <br/>\nproblematic - my niece needed constant supervision and she was  <br/>\nexhausting. My sister needed time away from her far more than most  <br/>\nmoms need time away from their kids.

I&#39;m in touch with all of<br/>\nthem, love them all dearly, but see the pain that has been caused too.<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe I&#39;d change a thing....but my parents have said many<br/>\ntimes they would have done it different if they could reverse time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111559,"nextTopicId":111571}}
