Luckily for us, we <br/>\nwere on this when he was little, before we knew we were going to be involved <br/>\nin homeschooling.  We had helped him develop workable self-calming routines <br/>\nwhen he was a toddler, and we had learned ourselves (Keith and I) tricks for <br/>\nhelping him center quickly when he was about to spin out.  It was another <br/>\nwhole deal when Marty became a factor in Kirby&#39;s life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHad we used the same methods and ideas our parents had, Kirby would likely be <br/>\na hostile, defensive mess now, and we might be the kind of parents who would <br/>\nsay we didn&#39;t much like him, and we would probably be grounding him and other <br/>\nnon-productive parent vs. kid behaviors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe worked hard at helping him be the best we and he together could figure out <br/>\nfor him to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of running a homeschooling playgroup for many, many years we have met <br/>\nother families (&quot;met&quot; is too light a word for families you see weekly, whose <br/>\nkids stay over, whose moms share intimate home-stories, etc.) with boys who <br/>\nwere eight, ten, fourteen and who came to homeschooling because the boys were <br/>\nNOT peaceable, self-controlled, likeable guys.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone decides the path they&#39;re on is not leading where they want to <br/>\ngo, some of them decide to homeschool.  And at that point they make lots of <br/>\ndecisions.  Will they continue as they were?  What factors in that child&#39;s <br/>\nlife are making the situation worse?  What could be done to re-direct energy, <br/>\nto rebuild self-esteem, to back up (because it DOES involve some backing up <br/>\nand being still) and choose a new direction and a new pace and a new idea <br/>\nabout the destination?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the boys (I&#39;m thinking of five of them specifically) whose parents <br/>\nwent from structure to unschooling, only one maintained his bristliness, and <br/>\neven in that case he wasn&#39;t in trouble for it as he had been in school, <br/>\nnobody was attacking him for it, he wasn&#39;t in tears over trying to explain <br/>\nhis side of situations at home, at school.  He was able to get time and <br/>\nprivacy to read and be by himself and calm down, luxuries he hadn&#39;t had when <br/>\nhe was in school and his parents were just desperately trying to get him to <br/>\n&quot;be good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he still has his irritating traits, but he also has real friends.  And <br/>\nbecause I know his parents and his sister and have met an aunt and a <br/>\ngrandmother, I know that he&#39;s like his dad.  And his dad (though sometimes <br/>\nirritating! &lt;bwg&gt;) is a good guy, artistic, hard-working, funny, inflexible, <br/>\ncontrolling, reactionary, and he has learned over the years how to deal with <br/>\nhis quirks, so he can help his son do it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OH!..
