It&#39;s the way kids learned<br/>\nfrom the moment they were born. Some people define unschooling as not doing<br/>\nschool. Some people define it as child-led learning. I find the defintions a<br/>\nlot more useful to people who already understand unschooling. They are<br/>\nshorthand ways of saying things we already understand but they are<br/>\nmisleading and leave out a huge amount of information for those who don&#39;t<br/>\nalready understand. For instance people will hear not doing school and<br/>\nconclude they can&#39;t let their kids do workbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people also want to stretch unschooling into parenting so figuring out<br/>\nhow to be our children&#39;s partners in life as well as learning also gets<br/>\ndiscussed. (Unschoolers who don&#39;t want to stretch unschooling into parenting<br/>\ncan find standard parenting discussed oodles of places on the internet.<br/>\nThere are very few places where &quot;unschooling parenting&quot; gets discussed and<br/>\nthis happens to be one of them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning the definition of unschooling by reading about unschooling is like<br/>\na toddler learning English. Kids pick up the rules of word order just by<br/>\nlistening and using English. And it works a whole lot better than being<br/>\ntaught the rules of English.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This told me some things that unschooling was<br/>\n&gt; NOT, but did not begin to define what it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The first paragraph of the introduction tries to give a flavor of how<br/>\nunschooling gets discussed here. If it doesn&#39;t make sense to you then it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably a pretty good indicator that your defintion is very different. And<br/>\nthe last line of the first paragraph is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>\n&gt; find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>\n&gt; learning, come join us!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So does a place that advertises:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they<br/>\n&gt; need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a<br/>\n&gt; facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and<br/>\n&gt; how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob<br/>\n&gt; Squarepants!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sound like a place you&#39;d like to hang out in?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second paragraph is intended to help people who arrive with some of the<br/>\ncommon other definitions of unschooling that are popping up in the general<br/>\npopulation. It was to help people figure out if this list would be useful to<br/>\nthem. The misunderstandings have gone way down since the description was put<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, gee, I thought<br/>\n&gt; what my daughter was doing with spelling was just that:  parent-<br/>\n&gt; directed learning while she was engaged in a learning activity of her<br/>\n&gt; choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As someone pointed out, parent-directed learning isn&#39;t part of the scope of<br/>\nthis list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No child under the care of loving and responsible parents is totally<br/>\n&gt; free to choose the what, when, where and how of their learning.  For<br/>\n&gt; some things they might choose could also get the parents thrown in<br/>\n&gt; jail, or will cost a lot to repair the damage done while choosing<br/>\n&gt; some less constructive learning paths.  Maybe rich people&#39;s kids get<br/>\n&gt; that kind of total freedom, but I&#39;m not rich.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then your imagination is leading you to conclude that being free to choose<br/>\nmeans choosing to stop thinking and stop caring and being free from<br/>\ninformation and other people&#39;s feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have families here whose children are free to choose and whose children<br/>\ndo take decision making seriously. My daughter could drip wax onto the<br/>\ncarpet or throw rocks through windows but she chooses not to because she&#39;d<br/>\nsee what would be gained by it (the result) wouldn&#39;t balance out what would<br/>\nbe lost (things ruined).<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of kids who have been controlled get destructive when control is<br/>\nreleased. But that&#39;s a response to the control not to the freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren having free choice doesn&#39;t make much sense in our society.<br/>\nDecisions of when to control children are based on what we&#39;re certain will<br/>\nhappen rather than anyone&#39;s real experience with what will happen. For<br/>\nexample it&#39;s easy to conclude that kids won&#39;t learn unless they&#39;re forced<br/>\nbecause most (schooled) kids avoid anything that looks like learning when<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t in school. But the conclusion is based on the assumption that<br/>\nhaving to go to school has no effect on kids behavior. That how schooled<br/>\nkids behave is how kids behave. Obviously unschoolers know differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd parents who have raised their children with the freedom to choose in<br/>\ntheir lives also know differently: that control does alter people&#39;s natural<br/>\nbehavior and assumptions based on the behavior of controlled children (which<br/>\nis most children!) doesn&#39;t apply to children without those controls.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: SchoolAtHomers/spelling","postDate":"1037928557","msgId":50485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYmMwMWMyOTFjYSQ4OWRiY2QyMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyLjI5MTEwMDMyLjJiMGViZjg5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":50478,"nextInTopic":50500,"prevInTime":50484,"nextInTime":50486,"topicId":50379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Call me ...

Did I say that she <br/>\ncould ONLY do these three things with me ALWAYS checking her <br/>\nspelling?  No.  I was referring to one specific very brief period in <br/>\nher life, our lives, when she did this, for a few months at age 8 <br/>\nmore than 7 years ago.  She was only allowed to use ICQ and IM <br/>\ntransmissions with supervision.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one she used the most often and the one I supervised most closely <br/>\nwas a chess site that she liked because she was getting very good at <br/>\nchess.  And it had accompanying chat/IMing.  I had already discovered <br/>\nthat some of the boys, claiming to be 12-13, used very sophisticated <br/>\nlangauge patterns and vocabulary and spelled meticulously, usually a <br/>\nsign of someone much older than 12-13.  And I soon found that the <br/>\nmessaging on this site was deteriorating into vulgarity and sexual <br/>\ninnuendo, so we discussed it and she determined that it was no longer <br/>\na fun site.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe left that site but she continued some ICQ and IM messaging.  But <br/>\nsince anyone can be faking it on these kinds of transmissions I <br/>\nmonitored them.  Not so for e-mail, actually, though I would help her <br/>\nwith spelling if she asked, which she often did.  Which is how this <br/>\nall got started in the first place, because she asked for help, <br/>\nwanted to spell correctly.  She became very adept at using spellcheck <br/>\nand various dictionaries and soon no longer needed any help from me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t checked her spelling in years now.  The brief period when I <br/>\ndid this was also when I was running my business with my computer, my <br/>\nonly computer then, and so I also monitored to make sure that nothing <br/>\nhappened to my system, which was very important.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n&lt;&gt;Checking emails for safety reasons is a totally different issue <br/>\nfrom checking emails because correct spelling is &quot;important for your <br/>\nchild&#39;s future.&quot;&lt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy statement about spelling being important for your child&#39;s future <br/>\ncame after I had clearly stated that I felt that the convention of <br/>\nspelling, along with other grammar and punctuation conventions should <br/>\nnot be pushed because they are not indicators of intelligence, which <br/>\nrelated to a comment someone else had made, slurring folks who did <br/>\nnot spell correctly on message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;The former would probably strike many people as reasonable but not <br/>\nso much the latter.  And you were specifically talking about <br/>\nspelling, not about safety.  If you had said something vague like &quot;I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s very important to check my young daughter&#39;s emails before <br/>\nshe sends them&quot; that would be open to the question &quot;oh, why do you do <br/>\nthat?&quot;  But when the topic is spelling, and you say clearly that you <br/>\ninsist on proofreading because spelling&#39;s an important convention, <br/>\nthen there&#39;s no assuming going on... just responding.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing goes back to a post that apparently everyone has long <br/>\nforgotten, though it was only yesterday.  Time flies when you are <br/>\nbeing attacked!  It is possible, of course, that the person who came <br/>\nafter me on this was only trying to deflect from my comments about <br/>\nclass and spelling and labeling people as stupid or lacking in <br/>\nintelligence because they could not spell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still want to know why we are supposed to allow our children to do <br/>\nwhat they want when they want, but we have different rules completely <br/>\nfor adults here?  And there&#39;s still this underlying assumption that <br/>\nsomehow, by osmosis, or by plowing through thousands of posts, all <br/>\nnew members are supposed to know exactly what the list moderator and <br/>\nowner mean by their specific version of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI admit to being a little bit forewarned about the incongruity on <br/>\nthis list when I read, &quot;As discussed on this list and at the <br/>\nUnschooling.com website, unschooling is *not* defined as the free <br/>\nlearning kids do outside of parent-directed learning, nor is it done <br/>\non a part-time basis.&quot;  This told me some things that unschooling was <br/>\nNOT, but did not begin to define what it was.  And, gee, I thought <br/>\nwhat my daughter was doing with spelling was just that:  parent-<br/>\ndirected learning while she was engaged in a learning activity of her <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other statement that telescoped subtle incongruity was:  &quot;An <br/>\nunschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and how of <br/>\ntheir learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>\nSquarepants!&quot;   As I said, I&#39;m coming to your house for the throwing <br/>\nrocks through windows phase of learning, or the melting candles on <br/>\ncarpet phase, or any of the other expensive and dangerous phases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo child under the care of loving and responsible parents is totally <br/>\nfree to choose the what, when, where and how of their learning.  For <br/>\nsome things they might choose could also get the parents thrown in <br/>\njail, or will cost a lot to repair the damage done while choosing <br/>\nsome less constructive learning paths.  Maybe rich people&#39;s kids get <br/>\nthat kind of total freedom, but I&#39;m not rich.       <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"patti.schmidt2@verizon.net","from":"&lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"SchoolAtHomers/spelling","postDate":"1037892226","msgId":50379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMTIxMTUyMzQ2LkJIRkUyNTA3NC5vdXQwMDQudmVyaXpvbi5uZXRAWzEyNy4wLjAuMV0+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50428,"prevInTime":50378,"nextInTime":50380,"topicId":50379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Snd the best way to use this is to never assume anything.
