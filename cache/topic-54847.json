Neill) and wanted to share some quotes.  Even though it<br/>\nwas (is?) a school, it is really like unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, we set out to make a school in which we should allow children freedom<br/>\nto be themselves.  In order to do this, we had to renounce all discipline,<br/>\nall direction, all suggestion, all moral training, all religious<br/>\ninstruction...<br/>\nMy view is that a child is inately wise and realistic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What is Summerhill like?  Well, for one thing, lessons are optional.<br/>\nChildren can go to them or stay away from them - for years if they want to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have no new methods of teaching, because we do not consider that<br/>\nteaching in itself matters very much.Whether a school has or has not a<br/>\nspecial method for teaching long division is of no significance, for long<br/>\ndivision is of no importance except to those who WANT to learn it.  And the<br/>\nchild who WANTS to learn long division WILL learn it no matter how it is<br/>\ntaught.&quot;  [I used caps where he used italics.  Also, this sounded like a<br/>\nrecent conversation I&#39;d read here.  This next part does too]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Children who come to Summerhill as kindergarteners attend lessons from the<br/>\nbeginning of their stay; but pupils from other schools vow that they will<br/>\nnever attend any beastly lessons again at any time.  They play and cycle and<br/>\nget in people&#39;s way, but they fight shy of lessons.  This sometimes goes on<br/>\nfor months.  The recovery time is proportionate to the hatred their last<br/>\nschool gave them.  Our record case was a girl from a convent.  She loafed<br/>\nfor three years.  The average period of recovery from lesson aversion is<br/>\nthree months.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Creators learn what they want to learn in order to have the tools that<br/>\ntheir originality and genius demand.  We do not know how much creation is<br/>\nkilled in the classroom  [or structured homeschool?]  with its emphasis on<br/>\nlearning... This notion that unless a child is learning something the child<br/>\nis wasting his time is nothing less than a curse - a curse that blinds<br/>\nthousands of teachers...&quot;  [and parents?]<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54837,"nextTopicId":54873}}
