I don&#39;t remember Oregon&#39;s requirements, but have you looked into<br/>\nFLO? (Family Learning Organization). You can purchase standardized tests<br/>\nfrom them. I did this with my almost 11 yo last spring. Her first test. It<br/>\nwas easy that way....it was mailed to me and I administered it here at home,<br/>\nthen just mailed it all back to FLO and they sent me the results. They have<br/>\na wide variety of tests to choose from.
