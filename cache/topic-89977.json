I think I understand but would appreciate some &quot;samples&quot; if you have time. thanks<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOk  -- I&#39;ll try to think of any that might have happened yeasterday. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday evening, Lydia brought me a large stack of Berenstain Bears books and asked me to read them.  I responded that I didn&#39;t like Berenstain Bears books enough to read that many of them in a row.  My next question prompted to think about her goal (a key negotiation strategy) -- Do you want to replace some or all of the BB with other books, so that we can read that many books or do you want me to start reading them and see when I get tired of reading BB books.  She choose to have me read as many of them as possible. Without prompting (although possibly based on other conversations we have had in the past) she sorted through the books to put the ones that she really wanted to have read first (another key strategy, being able to separate your more important goals from your less important goals.).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds really minor -- but you would be surprised how many adults in negotiations don&#39;t seem able either to identify their goals or to sort them for importance. <br/>\n<br/>\n I suspect, based on her behavior generally, that she brought me so many BB books because she knew that I would read more of them than I would have if she only brought me a few.  That ability (asking for more than you are prepared to settle for) is another key aspect of negotiation.  She seems to do that instinctively - maybe most kids do, I did.  I haven&#39;t done anything to encourage it (I&#39;m not sure why, I have to think about that) -- but I am very careful not to discourage it, such as by saying somethign like  &quot;I would be more likely to read if you brought me only the ones that you really wanted.&quot;   That statement happens not to be true -- but I have heard parents say things like that to their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes she will come to me with reasons why we should do something and I will say yes right away before she has finished her list of reasons, which she then wants to finish telling me.  I usually tell her that in negotiation, once she has gotten to &quot;yes,&quot; she should stop talking -- but I also listen to her if she really just wants to tell me all the rest of the reasons it is a good idea to do the thing she wanted to do. <br/>\n <br/>\nHmm...trying to think of some other times.  Suppose we were playing somewhere, and I wanted to leave soon to go home and start dinner. This is a composite of many times, rather than an actual incident that I am thinking of.  I might say to her, I want to leave soon, so I can start dinner.  Is there anything you want to make sure your do before we go?  She might say, I want to play in the tree house and also get an ice-cream from the machine.   I might say, the ice-cream could take awhile to eat and I want to start supper soon because I am hungry.  She might then suggest that I also eat an ice-cream.  I might then say, if true, that while that would help my hunger, daddy might be hungry when he gets home.  She might then offer to eat the ice-cream in the car on the way home, or she might want to eat the ice-cream at the playplace, but offer to entertain Jonathan (her 1yo brother) when we got home so that it would be easier and faster for me to start dinner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat kind of give and take -- rather than just stating &quot;we are leaving so that I can start dinner&quot; or having arranged in advance that &quot;we are leaving at 6:00 --  is the kind of negotiation that gets us funny looks from other parents - who sometimes seem to feel that some things (like a parent getting to start dinner &quot;on time&quot;) should be sacrosanct. <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont&#39; know if you were on the list (or whether it was this list!) but someone once posted what their daughter&#39;s reaction would be to having someone tell her not to stand on the table (it involved sucessive meeting of each of the parent&#39;s objections as to safety to the table, safety to the child, sanitation, not offending her father&#39;s sensibilities).  That is the sort of dialogue that we might have -- but whereas the original poster seemed to find it unpleasant or unfortunate, I would enjoy it and be impressed by her negotiation skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she negotiates things with other people, I sometimes point out the power aspect: i.e.,  it is Akira&#39;s ball, so he ultimately gets to choose what happens to it -- why don&#39;t you try to think of something that he want also want to do.  Or to point out that if she is asking something in a whiny or demanding voice, it is hard for people to hear/process her request instead of just focussing on the whining or the demanding.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess though, as I think about it, I have focussed on the aspects of negotiation that require knowing your goal, being able to sort your goal for importance, being able to think of ways to meet your goals that also allow the other person to meet theirs.   I can find this to be surprising hard for myself-- sometime when I think I want to tidy, what I really want is a quiet chance to zone out by sorting things -- and playing SET with Lydia will do just as well.  Sometimes what I want is the stuff off the floor so that we can walk, and we can crank up the stereo and DanceClean.   I talk myself through this process out loud, so that Lydia and Jonathan get used to hearing the process.    <br/>\n    <br/>\nHope this helps a little.  If I come across other examples I&#39;ll try to post them.     <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140408439,"authorName":"Erika Nunn","from":"&quot;Erika Nunn&quot; &lt;erikanunn@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Need advice...","postDate":"1075608716","msgId":90041,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctRjkzZnNZQWdoNGJ0WncwMDAwNjE2OUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":90030,"nextInTopic":90053,"prevInTime":90040,"nextInTime":90042,"topicId":89977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam wrote...

I do try to prepare the boys when we<br/>\ngo; tell them in advance and if they have any situations they don&#39;t<br/>\nlike, I give them ideas what to respond (they are 6 and 4 now), or give<br/>\nthem the alternative to wait for me in the car (when it&#39;s a quick<br/>\nthing).

The past couple of <br/>\n&gt; months, whenever we go to to certain people&#39;s houses, she acts really <br/>\n&gt; strangely.  For example, today I took her to my mom&#39;s house to pick <br/>\n&gt; something up.  She gets infuriated when my mother tries to talk to her, <br/>\n&gt; which is usually in that faky grandmom-type way, or she talks right in her <br/>\n&gt; face (she clings to me, or hides her head, or tries to hit my mom and puts <br/>\n&gt; on her spiteful, angry face).  She also tends to really cling to me the <br/>\n&gt; whole time, and sometimes she will get kind of rude to me, talking in a <br/>\n&gt; snotty way.  (I hate using those words, but that is how she comes across.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now, when I take her to some people&#39;s houses, she is totally fine.  She <br/>\n&gt; sticks to me at first, but then goes off and is quite happy.  Let me mention <br/>\n&gt; that the people that she is fine with are also much more child sensitive, as <br/>\n&gt; in they don&#39;t rush over and greet her - they just give her space and time to <br/>\n&gt; open up at her own pace.  In addition, she is usually very outgoing when <br/>\n&gt; around strangers, so it does not seem that she is worried in those <br/>\n&gt; situations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, my questions are....do you think that this behaviour will pass on its <br/>\n&gt; own?  Right now I keep her on my lap if she wants to be there, and if she <br/>\n&gt; acts rudely to me or my mom, I tell her that she may not talk that way, but <br/>\n&gt; she may tell the person that, &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk right now, please.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Another example was today when she was clinging to me and hiding her head, <br/>\n&gt; my sister said to her, &quot;Sophia!  Soooophiaaaaaa???  You with the blonde <br/>\n&gt; hair?!  I want to ask you a question?&quot;  It was very obvious that my daughter <br/>\n&gt; did not want to respond, and so I told my sister that.  This is usually met <br/>\n&gt; with, &quot;But I just wanted to ask her a question,&quot; or &quot;But I&#39;m her <br/>\n&gt; grandmother.&quot;  Another example was that my father tried to talk to her (this <br/>\n&gt; time he was okay, but in the past he has been known to pester her), and she <br/>\n&gt; threw her head up in the air as if to ignore him and stomped off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I think that this is more of a problem with my mom (and sister), as I <br/>\n&gt; have asked them repeatedly to not go to her, but to let her go to them on <br/>\n&gt; her own time.

The past couple of <br/>\n&gt;months, whenever we go to to certain people&#39;s houses, she acts really <br/>\n&gt;strangely.  For example, today I took her to my mom&#39;s house to pick <br/>\n&gt;something up.  She gets infuriated when my mother tries to talk to her, <br/>\n&gt;which is usually in that faky grandmom-type way, or she talks right in her <br/>\n&gt;face (she clings to me, or hides her head, or tries to hit my mom and puts <br/>\n&gt;on her spiteful, angry face).  She also tends to really cling to me the <br/>\n&gt;whole time, and sometimes she will get kind of rude to me, talking in a <br/>\n&gt;snotty way.  (I hate using those words, but that is how she comes across.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, when I take her to some people&#39;s houses, she is totally fine.  She <br/>\n&gt;sticks to me at first, but then goes off and is quite happy.  Let me mention <br/>\n&gt;that the people that she is fine with are also much more child sensitive, as <br/>\n&gt;in they don&#39;t rush over and greet her - they just give her space and time to <br/>\n&gt;open up at her own pace.  In addition, she is usually very outgoing when <br/>\n&gt;around strangers, so it does not seem that she is worried in those <br/>\n&gt;situations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, my questions are....do you think that this behaviour will pass on its <br/>\n&gt;own?  Right now I keep her on my lap if she wants to be there, and if she <br/>\n&gt;acts rudely to me or my mom, I tell her that she may not talk that way, but <br/>\n&gt;she may tell the person that, &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk right now, please.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt;Another example was today when she was clinging to me and hiding her head, <br/>\n&gt;my sister said to her, &quot;Sophia!  Soooophiaaaaaa???  You with the blonde <br/>\n&gt;hair?!  I want to ask you a question?&quot;  It was very obvious that my daughter <br/>\n&gt;did not want to respond, and so I told my sister that.  This is usually met <br/>\n&gt;with, &quot;But I just wanted to ask her a question,&quot; or &quot;But I&#39;m her <br/>\n&gt;grandmother.&quot;  Another example was that my father tried to talk to her (this <br/>\n&gt;time he was okay, but in the past he has been known to pester her), and she <br/>\n&gt;threw her head up in the air as if to ignore him and stomped off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Also, I think that this is more of a problem with my mom (and sister), as I <br/>\n&gt;have asked them repeatedly to not go to her, but to let her go to them on <br/>\n&gt;her own time.  So my other question is, how do I politely, yet firmly, tell <br/>\n&gt;my mother and sister that she doesn&#39;t HAVE to talk to them or run over and <br/>\n&gt;give them a hug?  How do I make sure that her personal boundaries are being <br/>\n&gt;respected, while at the same time making sure she is not being outright rude <br/>\n&gt;to me or other people?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am confused.
