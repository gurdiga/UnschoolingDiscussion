Both very smart, <br/>\nloving, loyal dogs. Right now, my Dad has a Yellow Lab named Andy. Andy goes <br/>\nto work with my Dad every day. He stays in the shop while my Dad is <br/>\nsupervising the guys loading the bauxite ore into the trucks, and when the <br/>\ntrucks are gone to the ships, Andy gets to run on the piles. He sits in the <br/>\nbed of my Dad&#39;s truck and *guards* it, and when my Dad is at his house, Andy <br/>\ntries to be a lap dog! When my Dad flies home on the weekends to be with my <br/>\nMom, Andy gets the run of the backyard. He loves the kids and tumbles around <br/>\nthe yard with them when they visit my folks. <br/>\nWhen I was growing up, my dog was a Golden Retriever named Sam. He used to go <br/>\nswimming with me and helped me with the cattle. Sam would even ride with me <br/>\nin the tractor! He died playing fetch with my Dad and me when he was 13 years <br/>\nold. He went out to get the ball I had thrown into the field, caught it, and <br/>\ncollapsed. Dad even tried mouth to mouth all the way to the vet. Sam was our <br/>\nabsolute favorite dog over the years. After he died, my Mom scanned a picture <br/>\nof him, and made a crosstitch pattern. It is in an oak frame with Sam&#39;s chain <br/>\nlooped beneath. We took down a family portrait and hung Sam&#39;s there instead. <br/>\n(we are that much of a dog loving family) <br/>\nWe don&#39;t have a big enough yard for a large dog, and I never thought I would <br/>\nlike a small dog. But I found Maggie one day at an auction, she was the runt, <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t have that typical Boston flat nose. All her littermates were <br/>\nbeing sold for hundreds of dollars and nobody wanted this (ugly by Boston <br/>\nstandards) puppy. I picked her up and the lady said I could have her if I <br/>\npromised to love her even if she was ugly! Next to Sam, she is the best dog I <br/>\nhave ever had.<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]Definitely  Doglovers","postDate":"1033457378","msgId":44915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDAxLjAwMjk0MC4tMTQ4ODU3LjYuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44919,"prevInTime":44914,"nextInTime":44916,"topicId":44915,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
