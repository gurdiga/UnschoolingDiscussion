I&#39;ve always fancied the ride behind tent-like <br/>\ncarriers, but this is just WOW!  Having 3 little ones too small to ride <br/>\nbikes, I may have to invest in one of these!  This way, two could ride in <br/>\nthe tent and watch the other kids ride their bikes while one can sit up <br/>\nfront for some special Mommy time.  Then we can take turns!  What an <br/>\nexercise motivator. &gt;BG&lt;  It&#39;s so hard to get exercise with all the little <br/>\nones.  They hate being pinned up in a stroller, of course!, and a sling gets <br/>\nreally hot really FAST on a Texas walk, but this looks like so much FUN!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for the link, as I don&#39;t have the magazine, YET!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65562,"nextTopicId":65587}}
