My son started getting into Star Wars books a lot, I think he was older <br/>\nthan 8 when he started.

We read Aesop&#39;s <br/>\nFables, classic children&#39;s poetry, hand picked fairy tales (some of these are <br/>\nso graphicly gross and depressing, that we skipped them), and lots of folk <br/>\ntales from different countries (again hand picked, usually).   Also, short stories <br/>\nby Tolstoy, O. Henry, Twain, etc.  The Just So Stories by Kipling are great <br/>\nfor an 8 year old!   There are tons of great Newbury books, but many of them <br/>\nhave death as a major theme, which my kids didn&#39;t really like at that age, <br/>\nexcept in smaller doses.  There is also Swiss Family Robinson, and a host of <br/>\nstories like that.  I found that the kids loved classics if I read to them, but the <br/>\nvocabulary was often too much for them to do on their own.  By reading to <br/>\nthem, we could discuss what they didn&#39;t understand, and they soon grew to love <br/>\ndiscussing the ideas in the book, and their ideas about those ideas.  This has <br/>\nbecome a really important and wonderful ritual for us - it takes more time than <br/>\nif they read on their own, but it&#39;s worth every minute.   They are now reading <br/>\nclassics on their own, but I&#39;m still reading to them, again, above their <br/>\nliteracy level - now we&#39;re into adult classics.  My son was skeptical at first, <br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t continue reading something that was obviously boring him (he hated <br/>\n&quot;Hiawatha&quot; but laughed his head off at &quot;Just So Stories&quot;) - I was willing to <br/>\ndrop stuff without finishing it if there was little interest, and keep looking <br/>\nfor something that would grab him.     <br/>\n<br/>\nCory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86521,"nextTopicId":6396}}
