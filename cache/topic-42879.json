Let the unschooling ideas flow <br/>\nover and around you. Pretty soon you&#39;ll just float away with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think one of the reasons that I have had such a difficult time with the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;concept of unschooling is because a family that we spend a LOT of time <br/>\n&gt;&gt;with is very traditional in their schooling.  When I see what they are <br/>\n&gt;&gt;doing I feel like we are doing nothing!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Stop looking at their schoolwork! Start looking at what those kids are doing <br/>\nin their free time. How are they using all those traditional academics? Are <br/>\nthey incorporating what they &quot;learn&quot; into real, meaningful activities? If <br/>\nnot, then what&#39;s up with that? Could there be a beter way?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd keep on looking at what your kids like to do and then DO IT! Invite that <br/>\nother family along to do something really amazingly cool on a Tuesday <br/>\nmorning, and then feel sad that they have no time because of schoolwork. <br/>\nThis happens to us all the time. I&#39;ll never understand missing a trip to <br/>\nexplore caves because the kids have to practice handwriting. :-P~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I truly need to connect with other unschoolers as well.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Keep connecting here and at www.unschooling.com. It really helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have to tell myself the reason I chose to homeschool was because I <br/>\n&gt;&gt;wanted dd to have fun and live a very relaxed childhood.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me it&#39;s that and even more. It&#39;s about learning because there&#39;s <br/>\nsomething you want to know. It&#39;s about keeping that spark alive that all <br/>\nchildren are born with. It&#39;s about keeping a child whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Live life,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>YES! Unschooling is also about allowing children to live life right now.
