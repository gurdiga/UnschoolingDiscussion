I do,<br/>\nhowever, say when they DO decide to help that &#39;More<br/>\nhands makes the work light&#39; and sometimes point out<br/>\nthat we have more time for fun stuff when everyone<br/>\nhelps...but I am never tacky and say that when they<br/>\ntell me &#39;no, Mom I don&#39;t want to help&#39;, I only want it<br/>\nto be a positive reinforcement.
