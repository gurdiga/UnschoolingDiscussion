I<br/>\nnever really used the journal for that, but reading about our<br/>\ninvolvements did reninforce my belief that unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;Talking to your kids is also a great way to be reassured.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIMHO, that is THE best way. It takes time and effort, and being involved<br/>\nin their lives--and shows you who they are becoming and what interests<br/>\nthem most. Funny thing, when we give the standardized tests to our kids<br/>\n(easiest form of &quot;proof of progress&quot; for us to give the state), they<br/>\ndon&#39;t tell us anything new; they just confirm what we already knew about<br/>\nour children&#39;s strengths and weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;A kid telling you all about this wonderful book they read is a book<br/>\nreport-an oral one-and has more value than answering 10 comprehension<br/>\nquestions on a worksheet. They will learn, and you will see it-just have<br/>\nfun and have faith in them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n\tExcellent advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shay<br/>\n<br/>\nFOLC homeschool support group:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/page/folcfolks\">http://expage.com/page/folcfolks</a> <br/>\n&quot;Va.
