My son went to school until two years <br/>\nago (he finished 6th gr) so he does have that mentality.  It is tough <br/>\nto get him to try things that he considers baby stuff or stupid or <br/>\nnot cool.  We have a family calendar that I have all sorts of outings <br/>\nlisted on.  I ask him which ones he&#39;d like to be a part of and which <br/>\nones he&#39;d rather not, so I can plan.  Most times I just accept what <br/>\nhe chooses, but every so often I know he&#39;ll enjoy the outing, but he <br/>\nwill decline because he&#39;s too cool.  Those are the ones I try to talk <br/>\nhim into trying &quot;just once&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago, I took my 18 yo daughter to a farm to volunteer.  This <br/>\nis not just any farm, it is a farm that donates farm animals around <br/>\nthe world and it has mini villages set up like the villages where the <br/>\nanimals are going to go.  It has a lot of unusual animals like water <br/>\nbuffalo and camels besides regular farm animals.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>\nbabyish about a farm anyway unless you look at a farm the way it is <br/>\nportrayed in baby books about farm animals (the cow says...).  But, <br/>\nmy son was adamant that he wasn&#39;t interested in visiting a farm, so <br/>\nmy 18-yo daughter and I went alone.  We came back with so many cool <br/>\nstories that he agreed to try it out the next week.  He went, and he <br/>\nenjoyed himself.  We helped out in the kitchen that day freezing <br/>\nvegetables from the garden.  Now he wants to go back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing happened at the zoo.  My son only came with us because <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want to stay home alone, but once we got there he wanted to <br/>\nstay in the car and listen to music.  So, fine.  My 13-yo daughter <br/>\nand I went in and we saw lots of stuff we knew he&#39;d like so we went <br/>\nback to the car and told him some of the animals we saw and THEN he <br/>\ncame out to see them.  Once he got in there he was the one asking me <br/>\nto wait while he looked at stuff a second time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I told the story about the kids in the car.  When I first <br/>\ngot the tapes, we listened to one story.  My son kept begging me to <br/>\nturn on the radio instead because the stories were for little kids.  <br/>\nMy daughter and I enjoyed the stories.  I though maybe because we&#39;d <br/>\nseen Jim Weiss in person and he didn&#39;t.  Anyway, that day in the car <br/>\nthat the kids were bickering, I just put the tape on and all three <br/>\nsettled down to listen.  He didn&#39;t even ask me change it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI bought my daughter a $100 pair of Timberland boots at a second hand <br/>\nstore for $6 in new condition!  Actually, I bought them for him, but <br/>\nnow he doesn&#39;t want them.  At first he told me he&#39;d wear them if I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t tell anyone where I got them (no problem).  Now he won&#39;t wear <br/>\nthem because the color is last year&#39;s color.  Lucky for him they are <br/>\ntoo big for him (Tim&#39;s run big) because I wouldn&#39;t have gotten him a <br/>\ndifferent pair just because he didn&#39;t like the color.  In all <br/>\nhonesty, he is a lot LESS brand conscious than other kids I know and <br/>\nI know that is because he has not gone to junior high or high school, <br/>\nbut it still is there.  I bought him a hoodie (a sweatshirt with a <br/>\nhood) the other day and he had a hard time picking one because it <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have a zipper and it had to have pockets on the side, etc, <br/>\netc because that is what his friend has.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Holly, my 13-yo daughter has no problem watching Telletubbies <br/>\nand Rocky Horror Picture Show in the same day.
