How their child is <br/>\nmiserable, how unfair the teacher or other kids are, how stifling, on <br/>\nand on. They say they could never homeschool because (choose one or all <br/>\nof the following:) they&#39;re not organized enough, coundn&#39;t work that <br/>\nhard, that they don&#39;t know enough, that the kids need socializing, or <br/>\n(the saddest &quot;reason&quot; of all) that they couldn&#39;t stand being around <br/>\ntheir kids that much. I do mention that I am not really that organized, <br/>\nand that I find unschooling much easier that fighting a system. Mostly <br/>\nI just say that the real beauty of homeschooling is that you can work <br/>\nit out to fit your own families needs, and do what&#39;s best the way you <br/>\nsee it. Change things around to use what works and throw out what <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s so flexible, and very individual.

It&#39;s about how they feel about what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing. Treat it as though it was their problem <br/>\nbecause it is only theirs. Yeah, it feels like a problem for you when <br/>\nthey start in again, trying to get a reaction. Try not to take it on as <br/>\nyour own. Nobody can make you feel bad without your <br/>\nconsent. I don&#39;t mean you have to ignore them, but you don&#39;t have to <br/>\nplay by their rules either. Maybe there is no magic phrase to use, but <br/>\nif you are feeling different about the whole concept <br/>\nof criticism it can change what you do say and do about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen others have a problem with what I&#39;m doing, I might say again <br/>\nnicely that &quot;We are having a fine time and the unschooling (or <br/>\nwhatever) is really working for us&quot;.
