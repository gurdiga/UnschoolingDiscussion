Hopefully unschooling for you isn&#39;t <br/>\n  tantamount to no-learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This list is currently expending a hell of a lot of energy taking a guy to <br/>\n  task who has real problems with modern government. (Ned, funny how <br/>\n  California&#39;s R4 filers today received a note telling them that they can no <br/>\n  longer claim private school status and must stop homeschooling, unless it is <br/>\n  through the state. Keep up the good work.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  People are talking about having their feelings hurt and such, because they <br/>\n  hold gentler views about the state and its education than he does, and he <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t seem to want to let it drop. Fine. Let&#39;s move on. But you come along <br/>\n  with a statement that only an ignoramus could make, and not one peep from <br/>\n  anyone at this list. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your figures are asinine. Regardless, one murder in the name of Jesus is one <br/>\n  too many. But the interesting thing is that Christianity has a paradigm with <br/>\n  which people as yourself can use to see if its adherents are measuring up. <br/>\n  Read the Sermon on the Mount (you might call it &quot;doing some research.&quot; <br/>\n  Interesting concept, eh?), and if ever you see a Christian not living up to <br/>\n  it, you can be sure that it is the Christian -- not Christianity -- that is <br/>\n  at fault.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So lets get to some of those undeniable secular figures. In THE LAST CENTURY <br/>\n  ALONE, atheists have killed: 54 million in the Soviet Union; 35 million in <br/>\n  China; 1.5 million in Cambodia.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Der Fuhrer openly hated Christianity (and there is evidence that he <br/>\n  surrounded himself with occultists). The number he&#39;s responsible for? I&#39;ll go <br/>\n  with the conservative but common figure of 6,000,000 (no offense to Mr. and <br/>\n  Mrs. Altman). <br/>\n<br/>\n  Spare us, next time, the truly insulting and ignorant claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bob Sale<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
