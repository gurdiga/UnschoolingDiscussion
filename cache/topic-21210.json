In Mo. we don&#39;t have to file any<br/>\nforms stating we are homeschooling. I am tempted to print something up on<br/>\nthe <br/>\ncomputer, with my husband as the principal and present that to them. <br/>\nI could easily make a letterhead. How does that sound?<br/>\nNorma<br/>\n===============================<br/>\n***<br/>\nJust wondering, Judie - instead of squirting it up there<br/>\nhow bout squirt it on HIM so I can get some sleep LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMom speaks highly of vinegar - she uses it as a disinfectant<br/>\nI put bleach in my dishwater if doing them by hand and we have<br/>\nany buggies runnin thru the house (colds etc) but (sigh)<br/>\nI normally just run them thru the dishwasher (bowing head<br/>\nin shame in the presence of women who homeschool AND <br/>\nhave time to wash dishes heheeh)<br/>\n===========<br/>\nHot water only kills germs if it&#39;s at least 160 degrees, which is too<br/>\nhot for you to put your hands in.  Also, vinegar and lemon juice<br/>\nwork to kill germs because anything below a pH of three<br/>\nextinguishes all life.  It works great as a contraceptive too....squirt<br/>\nsome lemon juice in there, and you will not get pregnant.<br/>\nJudie<br/>\n================================<br/>\n***<br/>\nJust a note on this one.<br/>\nMy son went thru a phase of this<br/>\nHe had been trained and then started messing his pants in bed<br/>\nI took him to the doc, wondering what on earth ... doc said it happens<br/>\na lot ... esp in boys and should end right away on its own, if not to <br/>\nbring him back in ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen my lil guy told me he had a secret one day ... so we went thru<br/>\nthe &quot;mommy is the one to tell secrets to&quot; thingy and he finally confided<br/>\nin me and told me when he had to go &quot;poop&quot; he would go and lay down<br/>\nand go to sleep so he didnt have to go anymore because it had hurt<br/>\nlast time he had done it ...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I talked to doc about it he said this is very common if kids<br/>\nfor some reason have a hard bowel movement in their pants or in <br/>\nthe toilet it scares them thinking it will always hurt ... so they stop<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I tried and it worked with him, was I told him I would go in<br/>\nwith him when he had to go and be there and that I promised him<br/>\nit would not hurt (then I gave him juices to be sure I kept my<br/>\npromise LOL and once he got past that initial fear he was fine <br/>\nand we never had messy pants again ...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I had a neighbor whose son used to hold his bowel movements<br/>\nfrom fear and it caused damage inside ... he now will mess his pants<br/>\n(at 11) and not even know he has to go - awake or asleep - how horrifying!<br/>\nHer doc said it is because he held it so much it damaged internally and<br/>\nthey need to do surgery at 12 if it doesn&#39;t correct itself by then :(<br/>\nPoor lil guy ...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo .. having said all that,  I wouldn&#39;t sweat it - as they say it happens<br/>\nalot but you might encourage it or help it with some things that loosen<br/>\nthe bowel and encourage him to try with you there so he has nothing<br/>\nto fear?<br/>\n<br/>\nAND if it is fear because he is afraid of sititng on the potty, maybe that<br/>\nbig hole<br/>\nof water is scary? They have games real cheap you put on toilet ... you aim<br/>\nand <br/>\nshoot rofl<br/>\n<br/>\nOR <br/>\nthey have a gold game you sit on the toilet and putt while waiting for &quot;it&quot;<br/>\nto happen - may take his mind off what is below him?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought but you may have already tried that. - I wish you the best<br/>\nwith it ... <br/>\n<br/>\nNice part is - they train themself in time ... as they age and come to care<br/>\nabout stuff <br/>\nthey work it out ...  Just remind him it doesnt make him bad, but you want<br/>\nto help him<br/>\nto grow up in this way and he can help you by telling you how you can help<br/>\n...?<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aisliin@...\">aisliin@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n Now we just have to get over his resistance to<br/>\n pooping in the potty, which he has yet to do.
