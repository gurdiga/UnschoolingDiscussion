I had a wonderful vacation, got back yesterday, late.  <br/>\nCanada is wonderful, as always!  Swam and ate and rested all week, with a party <br/>\nor two thrown in, and the whole family, Canadian and American, was up there.  <br/>\nAlex spent the whole time in the water or in the sand, he had his snorkeling <br/>\nmask on so often he has a semi-permanent line around his eyes, and he became a <br/>\nmuch stronger swimmer, too.  I wish we had gone on more hikes, but Alex and I <br/>\nlove the water so much, we couldn&#39;t take the time to get shoes and real <br/>\nclothes on!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everybody who sent suggestions on travel activities.  Alex&#39;s <br/>\nfavorite was a game where you think of a phrase, and the other person has to start a <br/>\nsentence ending with that phrase to make you laugh.  For example, &quot;bowl of <br/>\ncereal&quot;and I say, The kitties were swimming in....and he has to say &quot;bowl of <br/>\ncereal&quot;.  Of course most of the sentences that cracked him up were fart, pee or <br/>\npoo related, but that&#39;s not surprising... lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a homeschooling discussion while I was up there, and I just want to <br/>\nsay thank you to everyone who has helped me &quot;live unschooling&quot; so much that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t much care when everybody delivered the typical questions that used to <br/>\nupset me. Socialization, testing, etc.   I didn&#39;t get defensive or frustrated <br/>\nlike I used to.  Their doubts don&#39;t trouble me anymore.  Hooray!  And maybe I <br/>\nmodeled enough respectful interactions with *their* kids to turn a light on in <br/>\ntheir brains?  One can hope.......<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77961,"nextTopicId":78511}}
