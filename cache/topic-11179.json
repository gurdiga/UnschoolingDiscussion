It<br/>\nhelps to keep it peaceful and they learn how to work<br/>\nthings out and what isn&#39;t appropriate behavior when<br/>\ndoing so.

If <br/>\nyou don&#39;t feel up to the mess, maybe a paint with water book. I guess I am <br/>\npicturing you all around the kitchen table, with him getting to do something <br/>\nreally fun that he can&#39;t do all the time, so he will have a positive <br/>\nassociation with the reading time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also read in the garden while he plays outside, or at the <br/>\nplayground, or while he is taking a bath. Maybe you could find a 10 or so <br/>\nyear old neighbor who would like the practice for baby sitting-one who could <br/>\nkeep your little one occupied for a bit while you are there for a good <br/>\nreference and maybe a bit of pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nCathie<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Corallyn Berger","from":"Corallyn Berger &lt;hape2day@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"5brvX9enk6cRVD1CSpxq5LiJpkjLgekDSvdSItNLbMZpCid7J7XUZOI1DjKrgGUt4rwsJg5obaBU3OZat50KixuJYsmUW7GdnNpD","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] reading together","postDate":"963807803","msgId":11179,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzE3MDQyMzIzLjQwMTcucW1haWxAd2ViOTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11184,"prevInTime":11178,"nextInTime":11180,"topicId":11179,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you tried letting 3yo choose his/her favorate book and reading it first.

Then let the 7yo choose a<br/>\nbook. Explain to 3yo that you are going to take turns<br/>\nchoosing the book that is read before you start so 3yo<br/>\nunderstands what is going to happen. Then if 3yo<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to sit for 7yo&#39;s choice 3yo doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto, but be sure to offer alterative activity for 3yo<br/>\nthat can be done unsupervised so you can read to 7yo.<br/>\nIf this doesn&#39;t work then try reading to 7yo at bed<br/>\ntime instead of mid day until 3yo is old enough to<br/>\nhandle this.  Corallyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I try to read a chapter book to my 7yo, the 3yo<br/>\n&gt; starts getting really <br/>\n&gt; restless and agitated, to the point of yelling, &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; hate (name of book -- at <br/>\n&gt; the moment it is, you guessed it, Harry Potter),&quot;<br/>\n&gt; throwing stuff around, <br/>\n&gt; whining for food, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find I get through about two sentences between the<br/>\n&gt; interruptions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone else deal with this, and how? I have<br/>\n&gt; resorted to sending the 3yo <br/>\n&gt; to his room, but I kind of hate to punish him around<br/>\n&gt; books, for fear he&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; develop bad associations and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They have the same bedtime and the 3yo usually<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t nap, so he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; basically around, and conscious, all the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Help!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Annette<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet Yahoo!
