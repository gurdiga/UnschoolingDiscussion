I&#39;ve just jumped on Coca Cola detractors.<br/>\nIs that political?

They respond with something, or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Where did Jesse/Jon/whoever hear that, do you think?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nVery often it unravels as just something the kid pulled out of nowhere to <br/>\nhave something to say.  They need to consider that ANY information *could* be <br/>\nmade up on the spot, and so they need to figure out other ways to decide <br/>\nwhether it&#39;s worth trying to confirm, whether it&#39;s the sort of thing that <br/>\njust makes logical sense (like how to turn the water off to a whole house, <br/>\nwhich kids had to do at the neighbor&#39;s house the other day and they borrowed <br/>\nthe tool from us), whether it&#39;s something said out of fear... this is <br/>\nrhetoric.  Knowing rhetorical devices (not necessarily formally, by name, but <br/>\nbeing aware that they exist) and being on the lookout for purposeful or <br/>\naccidental falsehood is a BIG part of thinking, and of judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it involves the probity or reputation of the source.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Russ Anderson","from":"&quot;Russ Anderson&quot; &lt;anderclan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9lFiQCxgoMR_LnVZMRipddxLvD-dfv2hnD1iLmwDoekdotkdONb5WC8u4xQ02yEuxh-r2zjR169gGQvvrJcgW7BZDa7tGOnxdhue","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Compliments and Insults about thinking","postDate":"981134683","msgId":15767,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMwOGQzZCQwOTE3MDk0MCQ5ZjY2MTJkMEBSdXNzZWxsQW5kZXJzb24+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15772,"prevInTime":15766,"nextInTime":15768,"topicId":15767,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Guess I ll stick with this list for now.. mostly just for the fun of seeing what Sandra will say next!
