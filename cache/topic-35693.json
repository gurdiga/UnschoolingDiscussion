I&#39;m going to type out part of the text that grabbed my <br/>\neye, it so perfectly describes the journey to unschooling for me:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;......Small changes in behavior, attitude, feelings, can, like the <br/>\nlittle pebbles, add up to another kind of miracle. Small miracles do <br/>\nbuild up and they can last.<br/>\nWhen I stopped waiting for something &quot;significant&quot; to happen, and <br/>\ninstead began noticing what WAS happening, not what I wished was <br/>\nhappening, a series of small miracles occurred.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I began to trust what I was doing even when it didn&#39;t seem to <br/>\nmake sense, when I understood that what I was doing was seeking, then <br/>\nwhat I was seeking was shown to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople knocked on my door and said, &#39;would you like this?&#39;  Chance <br/>\noccurrences, unexpected meetings made me feel I was not alone.<br/>\nWhen I trusted I was doing something of value, goals and timetables <br/>\nhad a way of taking care of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJung called the &#39;meaningful coincidences.&#39;  Peter, a Swiss friend, <br/>\ndescribed the German word Zufall, which rougly translates as &#39;to fall <br/>\ninto.&#39;  &#39;Something falls to you,&#39; he said, &#39;not as something you <br/>\ncaused, but a coincidence you are ready to accept and absorb in your <br/>\nlife.&#39;  I realized he was describing serendipity.  I notice these <br/>\nmoments come when I&#39;m not demanding or insistent that they come.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, stapled on a telephone pole crowded with other posters, I <br/>\nsaw: &#39;Allow-for the possibilities.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Sue Bender<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what unschoolers do all the time...allow for possibilities.<br/>\nAnd I think that second paragraph is even more meaningful when worded <br/>\nthis way:<br/>\nWhen I began to trust what my children were doing even when it didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to make sense, when I understood that what they were doing was <br/>\nseeking, then what they were seeking was shown to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow....unschooling in a nutshell.<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35691,"nextTopicId":35596}}
