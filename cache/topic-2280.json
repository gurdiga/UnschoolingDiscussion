Financial needs<br/>\nare a percieved reason for both parents working.  It is not a necessity.<br/>\nFolks in this country are so brainwashed by the media and the consumer<br/>\nculture that they think they &quot;need&quot; much more than they really do.  It is a<br/>\nlifestyle &quot;choice&quot; which many claim to be unable to change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not &quot;NEED&quot; to buy clothes new in retail outlets, with so many options<br/>\nfor second hand goods and wholesale or wharehouse shopping.  That is a<br/>\nchoice.  We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to eat meat every day or other expensive foods,<br/>\nnor buy convenience foods.  That is a choice.  We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to have a<br/>\nbuying orgy for gift giving during the holiday season.  That is a choice.<br/>\nWe do not &quot;NEED&quot; to purchase gifts based on TV shows or movies for our<br/>\nchildren, buy video games, computer programs, or computers for that matter.<br/>\n We do not need cable, VCRs or even TVs.  Those are ALL lifestyle choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quality of your life does not have anything to do with how much money<br/>\nyou make.  But your luxury level DOES have to do with money, and Wants and<br/>\nNeeds are two very different things.  The choice of how to parent, whether<br/>\none chooses homeschooling and Stay at Home, Institutionalized Schooling and<br/>\nWorking, or some other combination of these and other factors, is a luxury<br/>\nthat we have as citizens in a modern and wealthy nation.  The cop-out of<br/>\nsaying that one has &quot;no choice&quot; when that is probably not the case, is<br/>\noften done unconciously.  People (whom I think of as &quot;Sleepwalkers,&quot; going<br/>\nthrough the motions of life and are not really growing or thinking deeply,)<br/>\noften do not see their choices for what they are, or do not see that they<br/>\neven HAVE choices until they really WAKE UP and start thinking in new ways.<br/>\n These people are not READY to do it any other way, and it has to happen<br/>\nfor them in their own time, sometimes not at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI made a choice when I became a mother (and long before that) to stay home<br/>\nwith my children.  My choice must then be supported by and reflected in the<br/>\nother choices I make for my life.  Where to work and what to do (work at<br/>\nhome could have been an option had I been a single mother,) What I do with<br/>\nmy children, etc, are choices too.  I choose to be a very active in my<br/>\nchildren&#39;s upbringing and I do not want to send them off to be raised by<br/>\nsomeone(S) else I hardly know, if at all, for most of their waking hours.<br/>\nThat is MY choice and what works for me.  But that does not mean that I do<br/>\nnot respect and accept the choices of others, and try not to be<br/>\njudgemental.  Everyone is at a different place in this life, and most<br/>\npeople move up and down the path, and diverge onto those less beaten tracks<br/>\nas well, throughout their lifetimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31786,"nextTopicId":31813}}
