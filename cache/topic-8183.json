I think Jackie hit the nail on the head that often<br/>\nit&#39;s us as parents who &quot;need to get a grip&quot;.  There are TONS of shy kids<br/>\nout there so this has GOT to be completely normal behavior.  It&#39;s<br/>\ntypical social development for most of us.  And look how many adults<br/>\nstill struggle with some level of shyness and depend on a glass of wine<br/>\nto get their courage up at gatherings etc...Pushing the issue, denying<br/>\nit exists, lacking the understanding or humiliating a child only<br/>\nexacerbates the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kayelle42@...\">kayelle42@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;    Karen<br/>\n&gt;    I think you did a great job with your son!
