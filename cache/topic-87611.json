I&#39;ve had four kids so I figured I should get on that path too.(My Gran had problems)  Anyway take a class from someone who really knows what they are doing then if you want grab a book or video to continue.  A lot of the videos don&#39;t go into detail about what you are supposed to do and go to fast.
