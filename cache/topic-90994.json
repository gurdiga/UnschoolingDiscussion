We got 150 channels of Dish TV <br/>\nin October, and after Xmas when it was rainy here, we burrowed down and <br/>\nwatched tons of TV.  On days when we are home, I would estimate that my <br/>\nson watches at least 4 hours of TV (which sound like a lot) and I watch <br/>\na similar amount, but I might be folding laundry or sewing or even <br/>\nreading magazines while the TV is on.  It seems like TV is the dominant <br/>\nthing around here, and I realize it has a lot to do with us not being <br/>\nvery connected to our new community and me not having lots of energy and <br/>\nideas.  And my child doesn&#39;t have siblings.  But, some days we aren&#39;t <br/>\nhome all day.  On Tuesdays and many Fridays we leave the house at 10am <br/>\nand play all day and don&#39;t come back until 8 or 9 or even 10 pm.  There <br/>\naren&#39;t any &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; from the rumored &quot;TV addiction&quot;.  ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t be accurate for me to say that my son has a steady diet of <br/>\nnothing but TV and Playstation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa H","from":"&quot;Lisa H&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] to all the posters on the tv issue","postDate":"1076691659","msgId":91004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTQtREFWMTE5YVpiTEFYM2MwMDAwMGFiNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGMwaTUxaCtjNmE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDAyQkE5QTguMjA3MDMwNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":91003,"nextInTopic":91005,"prevInTime":91003,"nextInTime":91005,"topicId":90994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One thing that surprised me, when my 9 year old was a few years younger, is that he would watch a rented kids movie that he especially liked three or more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1008141092\">One thing that surprised me, when my 9 year old was a few years younger, <br/>\nis that he would watch a rented kids movie that he especially liked <br/>\nthree or more times.

We kind of <br/>\nmissed the toddler book repetition age (my son didn&#39;t like books a great <br/>\ndeal as a toddler and was nursed to sleep for many years, instead of <br/>\nbeing read to sleep.)   Anyway, the video repetition surprised me when I <br/>\nobserved it, because it&#39;s rare for me to watch anything twice, at least <br/>\nin the same day or even month.  I had (and probably still have) some <br/>\npro-book, anti-other-media prejudice.  I could ignore that feeling <br/>\nthrough ONE showing of The Three Ninjas, or other low-budget kid video, <br/>\nbut after the third or fourth viewing, my conscience was screeching <br/>\nabout &quot;wasted time&quot;.  And, clearly, although parents may joke about <br/>\ngetting bored reading the same book over and over, I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>\nthinks an extra repetition of a bedtime story is a waste of the child&#39;s <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79793286,"authorName":"rachel_foodie","from":"&quot;rachel_foodie&quot; &lt;rachel_foodie@...&gt;","profile":"rachel_foodie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"to all the posters on the tv issue","postDate":"1076664177","msgId":90994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMwaTUxaCtjNmE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":90998,"prevInTime":90993,"nextInTime":90995,"topicId":90994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been up til, hmmm it s 4:22am now, so a long darn time.

We had a talk <br/>\nabout tv tonite, so it was providential that I found the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I have not been on the pc for almost a week. Last I was here, I <br/>\nposted quotes from Gatto and Pam thought I didn&#39;t like tv because of <br/>\nit. May I state that we have Dishnetwork w/tivo recieves and HBO, 4 <br/>\ntvs, 4 dvd players,2 or 3 cd players, 3 vcrs, 2 laserdisc players,2 <br/>\nor 3 laptops, 3 pcs, hundreds of cds, dvds,laserdics, <br/>\nvideotapes,video games (oh yeah 2 gaming systems so far) ,  a new <br/>\nminivan with cd/dvd player and 2 dropdown screens and 6 cd player <br/>\nplus navigation system (it&#39;s the new Nissan Quest and it ROCKS!). My <br/>\nhusband is an avid EQ player. My 14 year old son wants to be a film <br/>\nmaker (and has a new kick ass digital movie camera).  WE LOVE TV!!!  <br/>\nI also, personally, LOVE books. Love them to bits. I am always <br/>\nreading about 10 at a time. And I can&#39;t stop buying them. I am <br/>\ntotally addicted to books. So, hey, go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I worry about the balance of tv when my kids lie on the couch <br/>\nseveral afternoons in row watching the same Spongebob dvds. We all <br/>\nknow all of them by heart...no joke.&lt;g&gt; But then other stuff happens, <br/>\non other days, that doesn&#39;t involve tv and I realize it&#39;s no big <br/>\ndeal.
