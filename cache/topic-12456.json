This friend is<br/>\n&gt; rather hot headed and tends to get into trouble a lot.  My daughter<br/>\n&gt; is the opposite.<br/>\n&gt; Friends mother has said that my daughter is a good influence on<br/>\n&gt; friend. Friends teacher also said My daughter a good influence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Friend in trouble again.  Another teacher told friends mother, that<br/>\n&gt; my daughter is a bad inluence - and - this is what made me so mad -<br/>\n&gt; My daughter should be in school as she has to much time on her<br/>\n&gt; hands....<br/>\n&gt; Who is this women?  My daughter is with me most of the time .  When<br/>\n&gt; she is not with me i always know where she is.  When did teachers<br/>\n&gt; become GOD<br/>\n&gt; It is because of teachers like this, who judge unfairly, that my<br/>\n&gt; daughter ended up depressed at the begining of the year.  The reason<br/>\n&gt; she is now unschooling - I should have unschooled her from the start.<br/>\n&gt; Marianne </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12454,"nextTopicId":12457}}
