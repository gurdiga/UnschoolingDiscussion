Hard to explain, but we rented SWAT, and <br/>\nI watched the deleted scenes and little featurettes (while playing neopets on <br/>\na computer next to the TV), and then told Marty which he would especially <br/>\nlike.  The boys will watch a movie, summarize it for me, and just show me the <br/>\nscene or two that reminded them of my preferences or interests.   It&#39;s kind of <br/>\nlike a report, or like someone reading you a paragraph from a long article, or <br/>\nlike a personalized preview.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do a lot of &quot;connect the dots&quot; kind of things, moving from one movie to <br/>\nanother because of an actor or director or plot similarity or period or...   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty heard Colin Ferrell with an Irish accent, he thought it was a <br/>\nreally good job at faking one.  No, I explained, Marty had just heard him more <br/>\nthan once do a really good job faking an American accent.  So we moved on to <br/>\nSecondhand Lions, impressed with Michael Caine&#39;s Texas accent, and enjoyed what he <br/>\nsaid about having learned it (on some of the DVD extras) and today Holly and <br/>\nI watched &quot;Noises Off&quot; in which Michael Caine does his own accent, but several <br/>\nAmericans are doing English accents (some of the time, and lapsing humorously <br/>\nto their own accents sometimes:  John Ritter, Carol Burnett, Christopher <br/>\nReeve).   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat has just come out on DVD this week.  BUMMER:  No extras.  Extra <br/>\nlanguages (French) and subtitles, but not commentary.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93785,"nextTopicId":93803}}
