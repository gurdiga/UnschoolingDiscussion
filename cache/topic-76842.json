I started very young fearing my mom and my dad. <br/>\nTo get me to listen or for safety issues, a good beating was my lesson. Didn&#39;t <br/>\nteach me shit though. I still fear mom till this day which is why I&#39;m having <br/>\na hard time breaking ties.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our son was in school, I was the same way with him. He was the best <br/>\nbehaved kid in town, straight A student, teachers pet and so on. Part of that is <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s a great kid BUT a lot of that was because he feared me and what <br/>\nstupid harsh punishment I would hand out if he were to behave otherwise. I never <br/>\nspanked him but I did swat him on the butt once when he was 5 and he still <br/>\nremembers that!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with school and us, we did a lot of damage to our son and since we have <br/>\nchanged we have learned just how much he couldn&#39;t stand the way we were and <br/>\nthe things we did. We have been dealing with all kinds of emotions from anger <br/>\nto depression to resentment, you name it and he is doing so much better and we <br/>\nhave this awesome relationship but that is only because we have changed. <br/>\nPlease don&#39;t for a minute think that fear of a parent is good for a child in any <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76828,"nextTopicId":76843}}
