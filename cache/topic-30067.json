Its possible *terrorists* have them, I&#39;m not sure how probable. The <br/>\nWHO was pretty emphatic about it not existing - and they held that beleif <br/>\nfor years and years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe smallpox scare was put into action before 9/11 (also the anniversay <br/>\nof the Balfour treaty for those that want to understand the tragedy <br/>\nbetter).<br/>\n<br/>\nA few WHO ex-researchers were contacted long before and asked if they <br/>\nwere researching specifically Anthrax, Smallpox and any other plagues. A <br/>\nNYC hospital was trained to watch out for the above (Elmhurt Hospital) <br/>\nlong before that infamous day.
