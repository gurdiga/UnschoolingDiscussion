That ones in the tv room, the monitor tv broke so <br/>\nwe thought. Our old Br tv is in the 4yo room so she can watch her tapes as the <br/>\ntv room no longer has a VCR. We did buy our oldest a tv years ago and he has <br/>\nthe Xbox for DVD&#39;s and can move to the tv room if he chooses. Our bedroom has <br/>\nthe 27&quot; so we can see it and a VCR/DVD combo that the kids use. It has taken <br/>\nseveral years to get them all but they are here for use when wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a big price jump on products in the UK. Once when I had my .com a <br/>\ncustomer called from the UK and wanted a Baby Jogger. Here they are 216.00 after <br/>\nshipping and cost he was looking at 700.00. He said they ran closer to 800 <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n Laura<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Are TVs cheaper in the US?
