It isn&#39;t <br/>\nperfect - I love the first half and then I start wanting to do some <br/>\nrewriting when I get into later parts of it. But it is the best there <br/>\nis out there for algebra concepts described in words as opposed to just <br/>\na textbook that teaches how to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might also try going to a therapist - believe it or not a LOT of <br/>\nthe reason people have so much trouble learning is that they have <br/>\nmental blocks resulting from extreme anxiety. It causes them to not be <br/>\nable to concentrate when math is involved.
