You tell me if I get it. :)  <br/>\nWhat I mean is that we don&#39;t have a rule about swearing, but we<br/>\ngenerally don&#39;t swear in our family.  (I won&#39;t say never. You might,<br/>\nonce and a great while, hear a well placed SH**!! here or there.)<br/>\n  <br/>\nUntil recently, I hadn&#39;t thought about implied rules, or rules that<br/>\nshe assumes are in place. And even if it&#39;s a principle, won&#39;t she<br/>\nstill feel sneaky? <br/>\n<br/>\n  I might add that, although we&#39;ve never consciously implemented  any<br/>\nrules per se, she&#39;s always been a great rule follower and has prided<br/>\nherself on it. I&#39;ll try to explain. Example: When she was younger and<br/>\nknew she shouldn&#39;t ride her bike in the street, she would make sure<br/>\neveryone that rode bikes with her also stayed on the sidewalk, and got<br/>\nangry if they didn&#39;t.  I wish I could remember now how I handled it<br/>\nthen, because though I&#39;ve always leaned toward a RU parenting style, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t then have the insights and information that I do now.  (I<br/>\nimagine I would&#39;ve told her how great that was that she stayed on the<br/>\nsidewalk and that I was proud of her.)  She has a strong sense of<br/>\n&quot;doing what&#39;s right&quot;  and doesn&#39;t always know for herself what that is. <br/>\n<br/>\n So, I&#39;ve often wondered in my inner battles, if there are some kids,<br/>\nmy dd included, who like the safety and boundaries of rules and of<br/>\nknowing that they&#39;re doing the &quot;right&quot; thing.  I worry that if I tell<br/>\nher it&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; to swear online but there may be consequences,<br/>\n(friend&#39;s parent seeing it and passing judgement, for example) that<br/>\nshe&#39;ll feel (I&#39;m struggling with the right words here) maybe lost<br/>\nor even overwhelmed by the responsibility it gives her? For<br/>\nher it seems easier to just have a rule to go by. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, more explanation needed again. (Sorry) She often has a hard time<br/>\nwith too many choices and making decisions. She frequently asks me to<br/>\nmake decisions for her.  When instead I try to help her realize the<br/>\nbest decision for herself she&#39;ll get angry and tell me to &quot;just tell<br/>\nme what to do!&quot;  The funny thing is that, more times than not, when I<br/>\ntell her my opinion, she&#39;ll do the other thing!  LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve got millions of different issues I want to address here, <br/>\nbut this was long enough for now.  I will add that she&#39;s my only child<br/>\n(my husband has 2 older- dd & ds ) she&#39;s been attatchement parented,<br/>\n(nursed well past school age, family bed even now for the most<br/>\npart)and has never been to school, but is now wondering what it&#39;s like<br/>\nand wants to try it.

But she changed it to &quot;Kirby&#39;s Sister&quot; which is amusing to  <br/>\nKirby&#39;s friends, and a kind of definite &quot;back off&quot; to anyone who  <br/>\nmight think she&#39;s young and unattended.  She changed her age to 80  <br/>\nfor a while (I suggested something that was an obvious lie, not a  <br/>\npossible purposeful misrepresentation), and then changed it to 14.   <br/>\nSo now people can&#39;t see anything but the beginning part of her page  <br/>\nunless they&#39;re her &quot;friends&quot; (mutual agreement to link).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents attempt to prevent kids from seeing what other teens are  <br/>\ndoing, the kids will likely imagine worse than it actually is.  And  <br/>\nif parental attempt fails, kids have to be sneaky.  If parental  <br/>\nattempt succeeds, kids lose the opportunity to learn to sort other  <br/>\nkids out when they&#39;re all 14, and if they come into the whole teen  <br/>\nscene at 17 or 18 and in person, and haven&#39;t had the opportunity to  <br/>\nsee how some kids posture and bullshit, and how others are  <br/>\nresponsible and kind, they&#39;re likely to make some honestly horribly  <br/>\nbad mistakes:  non-virtual mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has an offensive, stupid online friend that won&#39;t lead to  <br/>\ndrugs or pregnancy.   They should experiment with some stupidity from  <br/>\nthe safety of your home, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a teen we only had school and clubs and church as places  <br/>\nto see other kids show their true colors, and we were VERY very often  <br/>\nseparated from our homes and parents by circumstances, distance,  <br/>\ntime, work hours, etc.  I have been &quot;stuck&quot; with boys I didn&#39;t trust  <br/>\nin various ways and places, but I was &quot;where I was supposed to be,&quot;  <br/>\nand assumed to be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people express fear about online exchanges and webpages, I  <br/>\npicture it side-by-side with all I knew and saw from Jr. High and  <br/>\nHigh School.  I am assured from all sources that school is MUCH  <br/>\nrougher and more dangerous and less chaperoned now than it was in  <br/>\nformer decades.   Our kids are not involved in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd up another tangent:  Holly showed me her myspace page as she made  <br/>\nit.  Every time she makes a change to it she shows me, not because I  <br/>\nwould make her do it, but because she&#39;s excited about the kinds of  <br/>\ntricks she&#39;s learned to put music and links and art on it.  And when  <br/>\nshe gets a new friend she gets excited, and will show me those.   <br/>\nMarty made me a friend first (I have two friends on myspace:  Marty  <br/>\nand Holly &lt;g&gt;), and has gotten me to help him get photos to use  <br/>\n(Kirby has too).   Because they&#39;re showing me voluntarily, I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to sneak to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child isn&#39;t volunteering that and the parent sneaks to see,  <br/>\nthere is still some sneakiness going on.  I looked at some  <br/>\nlivejournal stuff that was on the desktop in years past, and saw a  <br/>\nfew things I wished I hadn&#39;t.  Nothing horribly immoral; nothing  <br/>\nillegal.  Just posturing and angst by kids I knew well.  It didn&#39;t  <br/>\nhurt them for me to see it, and it didn&#39;t hurt me, but I felt a  <br/>\nlittle peeping-tomish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Advice about swearing","postDate":"1139152724","msgId":111727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDkwMWM2MmE2NyQ3NGNhZTU5MCQ1MTFhODk0NUBrcmlzdGVueDMxZHZkOD4=","referencesHeader":"PGRzMzI1dis0bWZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDAyMTAxYzYyOWQ4JDZhYTBkZGMwJGViYzZkZTE4QGRyYWdvbj4gPDAwMmEwMWM2MjlmMCQwNmZmZTAwMCQ1MTFhODk0NUBrcmlzdGVueDMxZHZkOD4gPDI2NTRFRjhDLTkwMjAtNDZFNy05N0VFLUVEQjY2RDZGNzY0MEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":111726,"nextInTopic":111728,"prevInTime":111726,"nextInTime":111728,"topicId":111720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ================= I ve always reminded my kids that some people will be offended, and they need to decide whether that s worth the risk or not.

In the midst of the moment, she handled the whole situation extraordinarily well, scaring the guy off and getting everyone to safety....and she also successfully prosecuted him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The moms who are upset are the ones who have 10 year old and under kids using the sites (because my 10 year old created a website for them, and it may perhaps blow away their innocence.)  I don&#39;t blame them for being upset, but I guess in our family its always been such an open topic and my youngest already knows a lot about the bad language, etc because of her older brother and sister.  There&#39;s more than just bad language though.  The kids often portray themselves as sexually experienced or &quot;gangsta&quot; and comment each other about how they are going to beat each other up.  And my daughter actually has gotten into a couple of fights but nothing too major.  It all seems very immature to me, but then they *are* immature.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I go through periods where I hear a lot of tapes running in my head.  I wonder sometimes if I&#39;m a terrible parent because I don&#39;t really worry that much about what my kids are saying on there...its not something I take all that seriously.  I told one mom that I don&#39;t take it all that seriously and she about flipped out on me.  I think she really had to bite her toungue.  And then I panic and start to &quot;crack down&quot;.  I told my 13 year old that I don&#39;t want swearing or references to sex on her site because its *not* private and it sends a bad message.  On the other hand, its a rather safe way to try on different identities as long as they know not to meet people in person without discussing it with me or another adult, or make sure they are making safe (public) arrangements, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And just the other day I told my daughter that she was leaving references to where she would be on Sat nights, along with her picture and that maybe that was too much information.  Anyone could show up claiming to be someone who comments on her site.  I&#39;m sure it will probably be ok, but I was worried she may not have thought it through completely.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Having read this thread, I&#39;m actually relieved to hear what the 18 year old daughter said, since my gut agrees with her.  I really do worry that if I make an issue of it, it may become a &quot;self fulfilling prophecy&quot; and my daughter will stop talking to me.  And that would be worse than having the stuff there and guiding her through it. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Whatever she may be writing on the xanga, she does care about what others think.  Just last night she was trying on a new look and asked my opinion.  She wants to look &quot;preppy&quot; but when she uses clothes that are too small for her, it gives a bad impression.   She actually did take my advice and changed clothes and we agreed that the look she wanted was a great look, but that she needed to get new clothes to accomplish it without the &quot;hooker&quot; overtones :o).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m glad she took my advice and it just goes to show me that whatever she is writing on her xanga, she really does care about herself and she does take what how I feel into some consideration.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Graduate school education  High school education  Home school education  <br/>\n        Middle school education  New york school education  School education in california  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
