I caught even more flack for refusing to tell<br/>\n&gt; them to NOT tell other kids.  I felt it was wrong to make them feel like they<br/>\n&gt; had a dirty secret because we chose not to participate in the norm.  I DID<br/>\n&gt; explain that most children are told that they are real and their parents<br/>\n&gt; probably don&#39;t want her to tell them otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;ve caught flack too, but imagine how distressing it would have been to my<br/>\nkids when the tooth fairy sometimes took 2 weeks to drop in at our house, but<br/>\ncalled the same night as the tooth came out to other kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why does Santa bring bikes and skateboards to some kids, and only a few<br/>\nlittle things to others? I&#39;ve heard kids ask these questions. My kids have always<br/>\nchosen to play the games, but eventually they have all reached the point of<br/>\nsaying &#39;couldn&#39;t you just pay me for the tooth as soon as it comes out, instead<br/>\nof having to go through all this?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest came home for Christmas this year, with his newly wedded wife, and she<br/>\nwas so rapt that on Christmas morning there was a stocking with silly little<br/>\ngifts in it for her! But when your kids have always known Santa / Easter Bunny /<br/>\nTooth Fairy don&#39;t exist, there&#39;s no need to stop the fun :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I *was* totally traumatised when I discovered the truth about Santa. I had<br/>\nnot had the least suspicion, but woke up and needed to go to the bathroom in the<br/>\nmiddle of the night and caught Mum and Dad in the act! My sister (4 years older<br/>\nthan me) told me that if I let on that we knew, we&#39;d never get another present.<br/>\nMy parents must have thought they had the slowest kids in the country because we<br/>\nwere still firmly declaring our belief when I was about 12 and she was 16!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16230,"nextTopicId":16233}}
