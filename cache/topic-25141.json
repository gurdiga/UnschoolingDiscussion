I chose the <br/>\ncharterschool and I believe I chose to do so with good reason. I didn&#39;t sign <br/>\nwith them just to sign with them. I&#39;m trying to protect my children from <br/>\nbeing kidnapped by CPS. My children choose what they do with their own <br/>\neducation. If we purchase anything wth the funds we get, they choose it, if <br/>\nwe use the funds at all. When I explained to my children what the charter <br/>\nschool program was, what they did for us, and what mommy would have to do for <br/>\nthem, my children were okay with this.

Whether or<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; is it unschooling, whether or not it is run in an economically sound way,<br/>\n&gt; whether or not your child or your family will use it, whether or not<br/>\nothers<br/>\n&gt; have abused the system, and the ps system -- these things don&#39;t enter into<br/>\n&gt; it.  This is her decision and I think it very impolite to state that she<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; dishonest to use something that is available to her to benefit her child<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; to get thru the hogwash as best she can.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In Florida, for instance, if you are registered with the county (instead<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; an umbrella school) you have to have an annual evaluation.  The least<br/>\nonerous &gt; method involves displaying a portfolio and log book and having a<br/>\nteacher<br/>\n&gt; verify that your child has made appropriate progress.  Seems very anti-un<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; me but you can get thru that hogwash and still continue to unschool.  Or<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; can become an umbrella school -- which is what we did -- or enroll in one.<br/>\n&gt; Then the hogwash is reporting attendance!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But -- the point is -- most of us have a certain amount of hogwash to get<br/>\n&gt; thru.  If you don&#39;t, you are lucky.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also in Florida, if your child is hsed thru the county registration, they<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; eligible for special ed programs -- whatever the child would have received<br/>\n&gt; had they been enrolled in ps.

For example, students are expected to be<br/>\nreading &quot;grade level appropriate text&quot;. In the schools, that would be<br/>\nHoughton Mifflin&#39;s Grade 3 Reader. For Cacie, it may be Asterix or (her<br/>\nnew fave) Politically Correct Fairy Tales. Kids are supposed to &quot;know how<br/>\nproducers and consumers are related in food chains and webs&quot;. Feed the<br/>\napple core to the worms, feed the worms to the blue gill.

He in fact came up as we were <br/>\nengaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we do, <br/>\nit&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the <br/>\ncharterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my neighbors <br/>\nare trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers desguised as <br/>\na governmetn agency.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters work <br/>\nhard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our unschooling <br/>\nlives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage in and <br/>\nthese are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our Educational <br/>\nSpecialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a <br/>\nportfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in last <br/>\nyear was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I don&#39;t <br/>\nin any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of learning, <br/>\nbut I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to the <br/>\ncharter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve never <br/>\nsaid I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I perfer <br/>\nto call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves anythign at <br/>\nall. We do what works for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly U  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marbleface@aol.com","from":"marbleface@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4XFnQdNDKOpZySz1qCfgu7HbAcAOdCUtT5Ybi-PWalBNPu5jYZNRZsFSosLz8XPpHcWIbPf1Jib_","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fieldtrip to a Public School???","postDate":"1000244053","msgId":25305,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwLjFhOTE4NDQ5LjI4Y2ZkZDU1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25283,"nextInTopic":25306,"prevInTime":25304,"nextInTime":25306,"topicId":25141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/11/2001 3:05:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

The least onerous <br/>\nmethod involves displaying a portfolio and log book and having a teacher <br/>\nverify that your child has made appropriate progress.  Seems very anti-un to <br/>\nme but you can get thru that hogwash and still continue to unschool.  Or you <br/>\ncan become an umbrella school -- which is what we did -- or enroll in one.  <br/>\nThen the hogwash is reporting attendance!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut -- the point is -- most of us have a certain amount of hogwash to get <br/>\nthru.  If you don&#39;t, you are lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso in Florida, if your child is hsed thru the county registration, they are <br/>\neligible for special ed programs -- whatever the child would have received <br/>\nhad they been enrolled in ps.

However we are actually considered public school students as we are<br/>\n&gt; signed up with a home based charter school known as Horizon. That&#39;s a<br/>\nwhole<br/>\n&gt; other story. The charter school does let us unschool. The founder of the<br/>\n&gt; charter school, Randy Gaschler, was quoted in an LA Weekly article<br/>\nrecently<br/>\n&gt; as saying &quot;Horizon does not require parents to teach anything or even to<br/>\n&gt; teach, only that students learn, nor do we prevent it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, since we are legally considered public school students, I&#39;m not<br/>\nworried<br/>\n&gt; about answering any questions. That was actually my idea to help educate<br/>\n&gt; people about what homeschooling is. I know Stephen&#39;s kindergarten teacher<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; very interested in homeschooling when we mentioned to her that we had<br/>\ndecided<br/>\n&gt; to do so after that school year was over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Stephen didn&#39;t ask me today about public school. Last week for 3 days<br/>\n&gt; straight he kept telling me &quot;Tomorrow you have to bring me to the school<br/>\nso I<br/>\n&gt; can go there now.&quot; I kinda came up with reasons why we couldn&#39;t the next<br/>\nday.<br/>\n&gt; Have to go get something from grandma at her work, have to go see<br/>\nso-and-so.<br/>\n&gt; If he keeps persuing it I&#39;m not sure if I can actually go forward and let<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; enroll.

However we are actually considered public school students as we are <br/>\nsigned up with a home based charter school known as Horizon. That&#39;s a whole <br/>\nother story. The charter school does let us unschool. The founder of the <br/>\ncharter school, Randy Gaschler, was quoted in an LA Weekly article recently <br/>\nas saying &quot;Horizon does not require parents to teach anything or even to <br/>\nteach, only that students learn, nor do we prevent it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, since we are legally considered public school students, I&#39;m not worried <br/>\nabout answering any questions. That was actually my idea to help educate <br/>\npeople about what homeschooling is. I know Stephen&#39;s kindergarten teacher was <br/>\nvery interested in homeschooling when we mentioned to her that we had decided <br/>\nto do so after that school year was over. <br/>\n<br/>\nStephen didn&#39;t ask me today about public school. Last week for 3 days <br/>\nstraight he kept telling me &quot;Tomorrow you have to bring me to the school so I <br/>\ncan go there now.&quot; I kinda came up with reasons why we couldn&#39;t the next day. <br/>\nHave to go get something from grandma at her work, have to go see so-and-so. <br/>\nIf he keeps persuing it I&#39;m not sure if I can actually go forward and let he <br/>\nenroll. I&#39;m sure before a week is even up he&#39;d be totally frustrated with it <br/>\nand not wanting to go back again. Sigh.

If the school would just let your child visit it <br/>\nwould not be so bad. But to have to let the principal and school ask you <br/>\nquestions on what you do in your homeschool is a bit much. Of course it <br/>\ndepends on what state you are in and what the laws are but I am sure that <br/>\nmost schools would not approve of unschooling. In some states it could be a <br/>\nserious problem. I hope you are in a homeschool friendly state. Maybe your <br/>\nchild would like to visit a private school? Probably not. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe to went through this once when my oldest was about 7. I kind of said we <br/>\nwill see and then I began to quickly look for ways to remove her attention <br/>\nfrom school. I began to look for activities for my daughter to do. For <br/>\nexample she joined a karate club and started taking dance classes. She loved <br/>\nboth and I said you know if you went to school you could not do these <br/>\nactivities, there would not be enough time. I also made trips to the lake to <br/>\nswim while everyone else was in school. Or we went to Grandma&#39;s, always a <br/>\nfavorite. A trip to the park with a homeschool friend. Etc.  Soon her friends <br/>\nin public school were telling her how lucky she was to not have to go to <br/>\nschool and so she could do these fun things. Now she tells me that she is <br/>\nglad we did not put her into school at her wishes. But it was not easy. <br/>\nKnowing that she wanted to do something and steering her another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this works out well for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheering you on no matter what your choice<br/>\nCandace</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Homeschool4us123@aol.com","from":"Homeschool4us123@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"N9Xj9SDKMorZNwYn2fahyxFXR10MDE1UehUNm38vb81M6beHF-dS8Fx_UuvN8Eh7IIlgkwvTM-T8UKT5C1jz","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fieldtrip to a Public School???","postDate":"1000164306","msgId":25141,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVmLjFhOWYzNTZkLjI4Y2VhNWQyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25164,"prevInTime":25140,"nextInTime":25142,"topicId":25141,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, here s my predicament.

My 7 year old son says he wants to go back to <br/>\npublic school. Now, I&#39;m sure he would greatly dislike it knowing his <br/>\npersonality and how he&#39;s become accustomed to do as his interests call him. <br/>\nThe children in our neighborhood went back to school last Thursday. The day <br/>\nbefore school was to start he told me he wanted to go too. I asked him why, <br/>\nand he said he wants to see what teacher he would have, what classroom, what <br/>\nthe classrooms are like, what the kids do, etc. I told him, okay. If he <br/>\nwanted that he didn&#39;t have to go back to school there. That I would call the <br/>\nschool and ask for them to allow us to visit and observe for a day. Well, my <br/>\nson wasn&#39;t too pleased with this. He hasn&#39;t said it, but I know my son pretty <br/>\nwell and he tends to want to do what other kids are doing alot of the time. <br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if he&#39;s feeling left out because he&#39;s not going back to school <br/>\nlike the rest of his friends. Our local homeschool support group is planning <br/>\na not-back-to-school day, but I&#39;m not sure if that would quench his want. I <br/>\nfigure it&#39;s probably normal for some kids to have this happen, them want to <br/>\ngo to public school when school starts and going back to school is the big <br/>\nthing at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else dealt with this with their child? Any suggestions on how to <br/>\ndeal with the situation? I&#39;ve always told myself that if my child truely <br/>\nwanted to go back to public school, I would keep an open ear, although now <br/>\nthat he&#39;s saying it, my heart is jumping in fear of even the thought. I want <br/>\nto stay open to him though. I really don&#39;t think he would want to go back, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s what he says he wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went ahead and called the public school and told them we are homeschoolers <br/>\nand that I have children who are curious about what goes on at &quot;school&quot; and <br/>\nthat we were welcome to in exchange answer any questions the <br/>\nschool/families/students may have about homeschooling. They told me that they <br/>\nwould have their principal call me back. I&#39;m not sure about actually having a <br/>\n&quot;Field trip&quot; to the public school. If my kids do want to we will though.<br/>\n<br/>\nHELP!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly<br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly U  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25527,"nextTopicId":25531}}
