The seperateness was startling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also had some abuse that was belittled, and made light of,  but am dealing with it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as you said,  when I had children,  I didn&#39;t enjoy *really* playing with them or later,  even really *being* with them.   I didn&#39;t know how, I was never shown.  I needed some solitude and felt it (I am an introvert) when my oldest 2 were 18 months and a baby, it was especially hard.   I was never told that this would be a short time,  enjoy them and cuddle them,  it will help them and you in the long run.....and so on.   <br/>\nYou are probably ahead of me on this and have heard all of this, but this was advice that I didn&#39;t even think of or hear of until after the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint being,  I  am now enjoying my children.  We are living together happily,  playing together.   And I don&#39;t get sick of them.  They hang with me sometimes,  go on their own sometimes.  They are older now.     We are all healing and loving this unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have to make a conscious decision though.  I was going to parent differently from how I was parented and every so often I have to remind myself.   Especially with society being so different than these ways.

My little girl is extremely verbal and creative and talks pretty much the entire time she is awake.  I usually love to listen to her chatter, but sometimes I do need a break.  I build in two breaks a day, in fact, and they are both at the gym.  My gym has day care, and I can drop Margaux for an hour in the morning and an hour after my husband gets off work.

I know that as a relative newcomer to this list I have often felt like I could never imagine being the perfect parent that is illustrated so often on this list. I think that it becomes more of a reality as easier over time of practicing some of the ideas and thoughts that have been articulated beautifully on this list but I clearly remember having a miny breakdown a few months after joining this list because I was trying soo hard to practice these ideas and let go of some of my &quot;issues&quot; and I just found myself totally overwhelmed by all three of my children and yelling at one of them for something (so stupid and silly I don&#39;t even remember what it is now) but I remember thinking, my God, do those unschooling moms ever screw up like this? and feeling a little inept. I quickly apologized for my behavior and went on but the fact remains that parenting for me has<br/>\n been the most rewarding wonderful, heartbreaking and exhausting job I have ever had. I wish all those mothers that may struggle great luck and love in their pursuit to find some joy in parenting and unschooling.

I could really <br/>\ndo without that whole stage. Large slugs! &lt;g&gt; I LOVE toddlers---could eat them <br/>\nwith a spoon, Eighteen months to three years? A housefull! I think it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause they are learning SO much SO quickly. They are &quot;coming into their own&quot; as <br/>\npeople with obvious likes and dislikes---and can finally let you know. And <br/>\nthey&#39;re so damned funny!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other stage I like is teens. Probably again for the same reasons! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get tired of teens. They change so much every day! And they want to know <br/>\nSO much (just not necessarily what YOU want them to know! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nA deal! I&#39;ll ship tiny babies to someone, if you&#39;ll ship them back to me at <br/>\n18 months. You get them back at three. I get them again at 13! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] being home all day with kids","postDate":"1060190507","msgId":78024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC5lNWEyMDBjLjJjNjI5MzJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78018,"nextInTopic":78025,"prevInTime":78023,"nextInTime":78025,"topicId":78018,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/6/03 10:06:25 AM, Heatherette@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-723982897\">In a message dated 8/6/03 10:06:25 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Heatherette@...\">Heatherette@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; She turned everything <br/>\ninto a game and I was so envious of her ability to do that.

If you <br/>\nwant to unschool, you need to have some flexibility and joy and happy <br/>\nexpectation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you an introvert and just get crowded?  Can you hire a mother&#39;s helper, <br/>\nto hang out with the kids and get them snacks and water and play with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t like to read to my kids, I don&#39;t like it when they <br/>\ntry to &#39;help&#39;.  I feel like a creep! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms like one age lots more than others.  Maybe you don&#39;t love toddlers, <br/>\nbut if you don&#39;t love THESE particular children, it will be harder to unfold <br/>\nwith them as they grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can heal your own childhood traumas by looking at little things your <br/>\nchildren do and thinking that you wish you could have done that.  And if you think <br/>\nit sweetly instead of with jealous resentment, you can allow the hurt child <br/>\ninside you to experience a moment of release.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI could be off on this, but if you have childhood issues you&#39;ve been burying <br/>\nor ignoring, it might be the season to release them.  If it&#39;s <br/>\nchild-of-alcoholic stuff, al-Anon can help you and it won&#39;t cost money.  If it&#39;s codependency, <br/>\nyou might find a self-help group too.  If it&#39;s survival of sexual abuse, <br/>\nlikewise.  If it&#39;s less generic, it might be worth going to counselling for a <br/>\nwhile, so that you are freed up and open to give your children what they need so <br/>\nthat they don&#39;t grow up with a lump left over from childhood too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 32 I started four years of going to Adult Children of Alcoholics <br/>\nmeetings.  Without that, I would not have been a good mom, and my marriage <br/>\nprobably wouldn&#39;t have lasted, because I had knots in me I didn&#39;t know that other <br/>\npeople didn&#39;t all have.  In that same first season, I got pregnant with Kirby. <br/>\n And I went to La Leche League after he was born.  Those two organizations <br/>\nand their ideas about how peple can and should live in peace changed my life, <br/>\nand my kids&#39; lives, and my husband&#39;s life in really good ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling seemed quite like more of the same, to me,  beause it&#39;s related <br/>\nto them both.   Children have natural needs for peace and positive regard and <br/>\nfor joy.  They grow best when they&#39;re not stunted, which seems obvious, but <br/>\nit&#39;s easy to forget if we go with the cultural flow which says children are bad, <br/>\nirritating, whiney, sneaky and so forth.  Children raised openly and kindly <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that where your kids are or aren&#39;t won&#39;t matter unless you change <br/>\nyour own heart and eyes toward them and toward yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":98863955,"authorName":"Heather Hall","from":"Heather Hall &lt;Heatherette@...&gt;","profile":"harrietsmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] being home all day with kids","postDate":"1060179855","msgId":78018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4NTdCQzRFLUM4MTktMTFENy05REYxLTAwMzA2NUEzMDAyNEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNjAxMzI3NDAuMzA2Ni42NjQ2Ni5tMTZAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":78024,"prevInTime":78017,"nextInTime":78019,"topicId":78018,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is the hardest part for me.
