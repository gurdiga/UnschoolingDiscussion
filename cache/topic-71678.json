Even when you like the guy it is the least romantic environment in the world and after doing the same kiss take after take you are so ready for a toothbrush and a shower and a walk outside... O.K., I am still thinking about that disgusting little man.  I can&#39;t imagine it would be all that hard with say... Sting, Mel Gibson, Sam Elliott, Paul Newman.  You&#39;de never know I married someone four yrs. younger looking at that list.  This list would all smell like smoke too.

Imagine photographers following you everywhere and millions of people speculating on your motives all the time. I don&#39;t think I could cope with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mark and I were watching Zoolander a couple of nights ago (love Ben Stiller-not doable but very funny!) and we got to the part where Derek, Hansel and Matilda got raunchy over tea. As they both began kissing her shoulders I thought how weird that was (Stiller and Taylor are married). Mark would beat anyone who attempted that with me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know it&#39;s acting but I wonder how hard that is for a couple who act. Could I support my husband in his career if it meant he was going to get naked with other women frequently? How insecure would I get? Couple that with endless magazines speculating further and I wonder how  any marriages in Hollywood survive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
