Also, she should<br/>\njoin <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NCSecularNetwork@egroups.com\">NCSecularNetwork@egroups.com</a>, owned by Diana (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Diana1422@...\">Diana1422@...</a>) and<br/>\nask to get on her list. Diana&#39;s is mostly an informative list rather than a<br/>\nchatty one but she could make connnections to people in her locale via<br/>\nDiana&#39;s list. Also, Diana&#39;s organized a zoo trip to Asheboro on 9-29-00,<br/>\n10:30 at the North American Entrance. Call the zoo to make your free<br/>\nhomeschool reservations and meet us there. Nobody knows anybody...(except a<br/>\nfew)... it&#39;s a group composed of people on the NCSecular list.<br/>\nAnyhow.... Lisa is her best bet at making an unschooling connection in that<br/>\npart of the state. I&#39;m too far away from her to get together very often :(.<br/>\nDon&#39;t let your friend get confused about Lisa... she owns the NCLoop list,<br/>\nwhich has IMHO been taken over by mostly fundies :( but Lisa is NOT like<br/>\nthat (a fundie, that is).  I can&#39;t explain why she puts up with all that<br/>\nstuff except to say she&#39;s very open and inclusive :-).<br/>\nGood luck to your friend. She can contact me anytime she&#39;d like for info.<br/>\nPass my address onto her....<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12689,"nextTopicId":12569}}
