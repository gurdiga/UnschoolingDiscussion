We&#39;ve <br/>\nfound a rented house back home and will be paying for it from Nov 15th <br/>\nso I can go any time after that. I&#39;m justa bit reluctant to set a final <br/>\ndate cos DH doesn&#39;t have his Brit security clearance yet plus I&#39;m still <br/>\nin two minds about whether to spend Xmas in an empty furnitureless house <br/>\nwithout DH in the UK or with him here but flying later in pregnancy.<br/>\nI wish he&#39;d get that clearance before I left though! They are waiting <br/>\nfor the police report from America to show he&#39;s not committed any crime <br/>\nhere. They US is being slooooooooooooow on this. Sigh.<br/>\nI really don&#39;t want to move back, pay for the shipping and then find out <br/>\nDH doesn&#39;t get his clearance. It will then be too late for me to fly <br/>\nback until after the baby is born then I&#39;d have to get an immigrant visa <br/>\nwhich can take 6 months for the babe. Plus work out whether I&#39;d stay in <br/>\nthe UK or return to the US.<br/>\nAaaaarrrrrrggggggggghhhhhh<br/>\nBut, fingers crossed it all goes to plan. I will stay on list apart from <br/>\nthat 4 weeks when my computer is on a ship. And I&#39;ll certainly tell <br/>\nstories, after I&#39;ve entertained all my English friends with stories of <br/>\nthe funny ways of yanks ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley, getting stressed</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Shyrley leaving","postDate":"1067362895","msgId":83340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwMzEwMjgwOTQwNTkuMDI1ODJjNjBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4LjM2YmFhM2IxLjJjY2ZmM2UyQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY4LjM2YmFhM2IxLjJjY2ZmM2UyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":83338,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":83339,"nextInTime":83341,"topicId":83326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
