And the area I&#39;m in is exceptionally reasonable. Here&#39;s a little blurb about the NW towns.<br/>\nHaving lived in Alaska and the West Coast, I am amazed at how reasonable Florida is, especially considering the beautiful beaches....much nicer than anything on the West Coast in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSouthern Small Fries<br/>\nThere may not be a Starbucks on every corner in Wilmington, Delaware, or Fort Walton Beach and Tallahassee, Florida, but they&#39;re certainly the cheapest places to live in the South. (Maybe the dearth of $5 soy latt�s is what keeps prices down in these areas?) Still, there are tradeoffs: Commute time, housing and utilities are cheaper in Wilmington than Philadelphia, but according to recent statistics, violent crimes occur more often in Wilmington than Philadelphia. Yet the negative statistics haven&#39;t made a dent in Wilmington&#39;s tourism. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Gulf Coast, Fort Walton Beach is just 200 miles away from the Big Easy, with cheaper housing and healthcare and less crime. Its 20 parks, numerous beaches, resorts and hotels may make it a popular, yet affordable retirement area. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to the southeast of Fort Walton, Tallahassee has just as much sun as Tampa, two power schools�Florida A&M University and Florida State University�and remains an affordable Florida city in which to retire, with average home costs of $99,790. In addition to good weather and good prices, Tallahassee has a variety of cultural events and tourist activities.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] housing prices","postDate":"1069209511","msgId":84979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMzYWU0NiQzOGEwOWU2MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdlLjQxZDBjN2QwLjJjZWI5NTJjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84967,"nextInTopic":84995,"prevInTime":84978,"nextInTime":84980,"topicId":84967,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1473499636\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Halo5964@...\">Halo5964@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I had the same reaction as Ren-average price 200k?
