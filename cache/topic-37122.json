We&#39;ve already read as many of the<br/>\nRedwall books as we can handle--they start seeming too much alike after a<br/>\nwhile. My older son loved THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN when he was about<br/>\nthat age, but my younger one is fixated on the animal adventures at the<br/>\nmoment. I think it&#39;s because it is less threatening to him if something bad<br/>\nhappens to one of the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think of BEN AND ME and MR REVERE AND I, since I<br/>\ncarry them in the store. There is another one about Columbus&#39; dog, too.<br/>\nPerfect solutions, thanks once again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRicka Gerstmann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36997,"nextTopicId":37123}}
