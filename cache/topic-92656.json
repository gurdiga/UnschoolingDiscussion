They came out to the livingroom where I was still sleeping, <br/>\nJason having left for school many hours before the rest of us wake <br/>\nup. They climbed up on the couch and rubbed my back and sang songs to <br/>\nme till a woke up. Jaiden then went into the kitchen a poured me a <br/>\ncup of coffee(his new fave thing to do)and Avery found the remote so <br/>\nhe could turn on the t.v. We watched the end of Yuh-Gi-Oh and went in <br/>\nto the kitchen to get breakfast, kids decided on Life and I went with <br/>\noatmeal. We were cuddled up on the couch, trying to be quiet, when <br/>\nJesse(my brother) came out and asked the boys if they wanted to play <br/>\non the PS2 with him, he had set up his in our &#39;puter room last night <br/>\nso he could play Final Fantasy #something or other, with them. They <br/>\nall like Blitz Ball. So They played for a while while I checked my <br/>\nemail. After about 45 min and a bag of easter candy later they all <br/>\ndecided they needed FOOD so I was drafted to make omlets while they <br/>\nchecked out what was on the National Geographic channel tonight, <br/>\nJaiden was hoping for something on mummies or the dark side of the <br/>\nmoon and Avery wanted snakes. After we ate, again Jesse took the boys <br/>\nout so I could do a little unpacking, I spent most of my time online <br/>\ninstead. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they came back Jesse had to take off for work and the kids <br/>\ndecided to watch Tom and Jerry, not my fave show, so I went in and <br/>\nunpacked a few of their boxes and listened to them giggling. They <br/>\ncame in to their room to see what treasures had been unearthed and <br/>\nwere very excited to see all their army men and dino&#39;s after a 5 <br/>\nmonth confinment in boxes and various storage garages. They are now <br/>\nplaying in the back yard, with a combo of army men, dinos, farm <br/>\nanimals, mud, shovels, bubbles and rocks enjoying a beautiful spring <br/>\nday. I&#39;m inside, listening to them run, laugh, and play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad that we chose this path, that they get to be outside on <br/>\nthis beautiful day, digging in the dirt, smelling the air, feeling <br/>\nthe sun, playing, playing, playing. Instead of being inside a <br/>\nclassroom (or stuck at the kitchen table) looking longingly out the <br/>\nwindow wishing they could be outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sooooo glad that I&#39;m home today and WITH them instead of waiting <br/>\nfor them to get home from school. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a beautiful day, and I just wanted to share it.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92707,"nextTopicId":92756}}
