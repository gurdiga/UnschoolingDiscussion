I know it has been a very hard road to find a doctor that is good...both \npersonally related, and medically..Actually we have had such bad experiences \nwith doctors it lead us to seek out educational oppurtunities in \nhealthcare..such as self care..and in the process we learned alot about taking \nour wellness into our own hands instead of leaving it to the not so \nexpert-Experts..who knows you best but yourself..if you have the time to get to \nknow yourself that is..we have learned about many ways to nourish health in our \nfamily, and I believe that is the key..wholeness..our way of eating has changed \nalot over the past few years...and we did happen to find a doctor that was \nexcellent..He is quite a wise man..he is a child advocate of the rainforest \n..taking kids over on tours to teach them about earth preservation, and an \nethnobotanist that has studied plants for many years, and teaches how to use \nthem in your home as medicine, and food...I haven&#39;t personally taken any of his \nclasses, cause I&#39;ve already taken native plant, and medicine classes, but I am \nglad to hear that My doctor provides this sort of education for the \ncommunity...this is important to me, when it comes to doctors..do they have \nsomething to share? that will improve my life? or do they have something that \nwill confine my life? or bring me fathter from where I want to be?..we really \nrelated to him, as we have liver problems, and he suggested to us the very thing \nwe were already doing with a friend...sweat lodge...it&#39;s a wonderful detoxifier, \nas well as a spiritual journey...i would recommend it to anyone who has physical \nor emotional or for that matter spiritual ailments that they are ready to attend \nto.&nbsp; I really relate to the part where someone mentioned ..and even if they \ndidn&#39;t, that disease often has it&#39;s roots in experience...it&#39;s interesting how \nthings occur..and the processes of healing..I do believe above all that all has \nit&#39;s purpose, and that many extroidinarily misunderstood conditions are of also \nof a spiritual nature, and can be cared for as such.&nbsp; It seems the Earth \nhas given us all the cures for the worlds, sometimes seemingly unjustly \nailments....it is our choice to , and readiness to heal that is often the \ncrucial factor..and even sometimes..it is the disease itself that heals us..of \nthings we would not imagine we are ailed with.&nbsp; Boy am I on a weaved web \nthis clear and beautiful night..I checked out those great sites on \nAstronomy...we will be returning to them..my favorite planet has always been \nMercury, personally..I was amazed at the history they had available..Thanks so \nmuch for sharing that with us.....Well the garden is one rewarding adventure my \nson, my husband and I share...I am the main entrepenuer but they follow with \nenthusiasm..it brings us togeher especialy during the harvest seasons..when we \ncan all sit for a spell, and munch on the garden delites...we enjoy the garden \nvery much, and I would like to hear more about other people&#39;s gardens&#39;s, foods, \nand outdoor adventures in the wild....if anyone can share.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nMichelle</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7568,"nextTopicId":7574}}
