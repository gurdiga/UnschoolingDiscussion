Feel free to e-mail me if you ever want to chat! I also have no support from family for the way I&#39;m choosing to raise my children, instead I get alot of criticism. My marriage is also on the rocks and I&#39;m just trying to figure out a way, at this point, to be able to keep doing what I&#39;m doing with the kids. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m glad Stephanie mentioned these experiences - the warnings, her<br/>\n  exasperation, envy of parents who have certainty, almost fear of talking<br/>\n  to friends about the non-controlling philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been going through a lot of that lately.  My marriage is in<br/>\n  turmoil - in addition to many other issues that we haven&#39;t got around to<br/>\n  discussing my dh will not discuss (or read about) unschooling and<br/>\n  resents both that I have chosen to support the children without<br/>\n  schooling and that I wish to be a non-coercive parent.  In our<br/>\n  counselling the counsellor asked what I feared if I would &quot;compromise&quot;<br/>\n  with my dh in the homeschooling.  When I couldn&#39;t answer the question<br/>\n  because of the ambiguities - particularly her desire to &quot;leave the<br/>\n  children out of the issue&quot; and I became annoyed with her insistence she<br/>\n  ends up telling me that it sounds to her that I have made the<br/>\n  homeschooling choice because of my own experiences and that I am afraid<br/>\n  to compromise with my dh because of a control issue relating to the way<br/>\n  my father was!  At the end of that session she intended to &quot;consult&quot;<br/>\n  with her colleagues and now I&#39;m wondering what all she wants to consult<br/>\n  on, and I hate the paranoia of wondering if she is checking out whether<br/>\n  and how to interfere with our (boys & I) educational choice!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m feeling vulnerable and uncertain.

It is kind of like asking someone why you want to breastfeed your baby, but don&#39;t mention the child. If the child isn&#39;t in there that leaves you or the world at large.

Your reasons for unschooling are sound: this is the best way for your children to learn.  End of sentence.

But then is that <br/>\n&gt; against the unschooling philosophy?? I don&#39;t know??<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one of the concepts I have been wrestling with too. I think where<br/>\nI am now, though is realizing that I really can not instill (teach) my<br/>\nvalue system. All I can do is model and explain why I make the choices<br/>\nthat I make. I can not *make* my kids choose the same way that I do (and<br/>\nin trying to force them to, will make it more likely that they will not).<br/>\nBy not buying my kids something that they want I am not modeling, but rather<br/>\nam forcing them to live by my value system. Modeling would be to see <br/>\nsomething that *I* want and choose to put it back and not<br/>\nbuy it.  Interestingly, I had a conversation with my 5 yo at little while ago, <br/>\nwhere I mentioned how I wanted a new sofa, but have not gotten one because we have <br/>\ndecided to get other things so far. This seems to have had more impact on him <br/>\n(he asks me about it periodically) then any of our other conversations about <br/>\npriorities (usually when I would not buy *him* something). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other piece of this that I am wrestling with is about deciding what my kids need.<br/>\nIs it really my place to decide what they really need? Can I really determine what<br/>\nvalue they will get out of something? When I was in elementary school, my brother <br/>\nand I want to the store with my dad to pick up a last minute something. He (after<br/>\nsome whining) bought me a *very* cheap plastic angel ornament and my brother a snowman.<br/>\nWe played with these ornaments extensively...making up scenes, carrying them around.<br/>\nIt for some reason became one of my favorite ornaments and I *still* have it and<br/>\nput it on my tree every year. It brings back wonderful memories. If my kids wanted<br/>\nsomething like this ornament, I most likely would have said no (extremely cheaply made<br/>\nand plastic).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where do I draw the line and how do I make these decisions...I really am trying to<br/>\nlook at it from the boys perspective and not make arbitrary (in their eyes) decisions. <br/>\nFor example...I hate to pay vending machine prices (especially $1 for a coke!). So <br/>\nif we were leaving somewhere for home, I would tell the boys no (and why) and that <br/>\nwe could have a coke when we got home (or at least now I would since I am trying to <br/>\nease up on the food restrictions LOL!). But if we were out and not going home, I <br/>\nwould be more likely to go ahead and buy it (if I had the money on me).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping that once the boys see that I *am* willing to get them things, they will<br/>\nbe more open to hearing about why I make the choices for myself that I do. And that<br/>\nthey will start thinking more about the choices that they make. Funny thing happened<br/>\nin the grocery store a couple of days ago...we were going down the cereal aisle when<br/>\nJason saw a Capt Crunch box advertising Bionicle cards with purchase. He of course wanted it<br/>\n(he LOVES bionicles!). Instead of just immediately saying, no, it is junk cereal, I <br/>\nwent over and looked at the box (I decided that if he really wanted it I would say yes).<br/>\nHe looked at all the boxes and I read them and we realized that you only got the one<br/>\ncard that was taped to the front. When he realized that, *he* decided that it was not<br/>\nworth buying the box of cereal to get one card! Could have blown me away....<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read Sandra&#39;s article on spoiling? It was a real eye opener...told me things that<br/>\nI already knew, but had a hard time believe as everyone has been telling me the exact <br/>\nopposite....<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled.html\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":80046248,"authorName":"Dalene and Andy","from":"&quot;Dalene and Andy&quot; &lt;mactier@...&gt;","profile":"mactiers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Tools of convincing","postDate":"1033303282","msgId":44803,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOGEwMWMyNjdiNSQ4NjgwNmM2MCRmNzViMzZkMkBocHBhdj4=","referencesHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDE0MTlDNjZAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44763,"nextInTopic":44845,"prevInTime":44802,"nextInTime":44804,"topicId":44587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Stephanie I enjoyed your post.

I have printed off some posts and usually leave them in the bathroom. ;o)<br/>\nI actually have started to feel sorry for the poor guy lately! I think that <br/>\nsometimes he wishes that he married a more normal (mainstream) person. His dad<br/>\nwas navy and ran a very tight ship. They did not talk back to him or they would<br/>\nget spanked. (The funny thing is that his dad is now the sweetest teddy bear of<br/>\na grandfather. My MIL has mentioned a few times that it is a shame that he could<br/>\nnot have relaxed and enjoyed his own boys as much as he enjoys his grandsons.) SO <br/>\nJeff really has a farther way to come to get to where I am. I know that there are <br/>\ntimes when he does not feel like he has to explain himself and that Jason should<br/>\njust do what he said because he said it. I am working on getting him to not take<br/>\nJason&#39;s actions so personally...they are not acts of defiance against him, but <br/>\nrather very normal reactions from a little boy who is still learning. That<br/>\npunishments are not the only way to teach him (and that in reality they do not <br/>\nreally do much to teach him at all). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I was talking with a friend of mine today about unschooling/un-tving/un-junk <br/>\nfooding etc and it hit me that if kids learn better by observing and being in life, <br/>\nthen why can&#39;t this apply to learning right from wrong and other life lessons? I <br/>\nthink that I had been unconsciously viewing parenting as teaching them lessons <br/>\n(about what to eat, how much tv to watch, how many toys to buy, how much money <br/>\nto spend) and if I did not teach them, they would not learn. But I can see that <br/>\nis not true. The past couple of days I have been trying to just enjoy them. To not <br/>\nworry about whether they are watching too much tv or if Jason has been playing his <br/>\nbionicle game on the computer for too long. And things seem to be going smoother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have these nagging thoughts in my head however...things like kids need (and want)<br/>\nparents to set the limits...that &quot;good&quot; parents are supposed to control tv viewing <br/>\nand junk food  etc etc etc. Still working on it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening...not sure if everything I wrote here makes sense or not!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

She never had a moral <br/>\ndilemma to deal with.

Is it with someone insisting that you have <br/>\nto know it, or is it when you decide it&#39;s something you want to know <br/>\nmore about? Consequences for actions happen naturally. No one has to <br/>\nforce unnatural consequences on a child. For instance, if Laurie <br/>\nripped one of her books to shreds (as she did a few times as a child) <br/>\nshe learned quickly that the book could no longer be read. No one <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Now Laurie, look what you did to your book. Now you can&#39;t read <br/>\nit.&quot; It was obvious what she had done. The same when she disassembled <br/>\na favorite toy and lost some of the parts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; Is there a point where one can be so worried about not &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that they forget that being taught can also be a pleasurable or <br/>\nimportant thing and that teachers and being taught are not the <br/>\nnemesis of home learners? <br/>\n<br/>\n**** Worry was not a part of our unschooling.

I have printed off some posts and usually leave them in the bathroom. ;o)<br/>\nI actually have started to feel sorry for the poor guy lately! I think that <br/>\nsometimes he wishes that he married a more normal (mainstream) person. His dad<br/>\nwas navy and ran a very tight ship. They did not talk back to him or they would<br/>\nget spanked. (The funny thing is that his dad is now the sweetest teddy bear of<br/>\na grandfather. My MIL has mentioned a few times that it is a shame that he could<br/>\nnot have relaxed and enjoyed his own boys as much as he enjoys his grandsons.) SO <br/>\nJeff really has a farther way to come to get to where I am. I know that there are <br/>\ntimes when he does not feel like he has to explain himself and that Jason should<br/>\njust do what he said because he said it. I am working on getting him to not take<br/>\nJason&#39;s actions so personally...they are not acts of defiance against him, but <br/>\nrather very normal reactions from a little boy who is still learning. That<br/>\npunishments are not the only way to teach him (and that in reality they do not <br/>\nreally do much to teach him at all). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I was talking with a friend of mine today about unschooling/un-tving/un-junk <br/>\nfooding etc and it hit me that if kids learn better by observing and being in life, <br/>\nthen why can&#39;t this apply to learning right from wrong and other life lessons? I <br/>\nthink that I had been unconsciously viewing parenting as teaching them lessons <br/>\n(about what to eat, how much tv to watch, how many toys to buy, how much money <br/>\nto spend) and if I did not teach them, they would not learn. But I can see that <br/>\nis not true. The past couple of days I have been trying to just enjoy them. To not <br/>\nworry about whether they are watching too much tv or if Jason has been playing his <br/>\nbionicle game on the computer for too long. And things seem to be going smoother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have these nagging thoughts in my head however...things like kids need (and want)<br/>\nparents to set the limits...that &quot;good&quot; parents are supposed to control tv viewing <br/>\nand junk food  etc etc etc. Still working on it though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening...not sure if everything I wrote here makes sense or not!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117801964,"authorName":"MO Milligans","from":"MO Milligans &lt;Ozarkren@...&gt;","profile":"trozark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Tools of convincing","postDate":"1032927195","msgId":44587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMi4yMDAyMDkyNDIzMTIwNC4wMGEwOWVjMEBlZGlzb24ucmlwaW50ZXJuZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEzREM3NDZAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGkgb25zLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44591,"prevInTime":44586,"nextInTime":44588,"topicId":44587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == Have you considered printing some of the better posts, and then just leaving them lying around? :) Todd If you choose not to decide, you still have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2031729150\">At 11:03 PM 9/24/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Slowly trying to prepare him for where<br/>\n&gt;I am headed.
