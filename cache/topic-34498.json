Someone said <br/>\nthat left and right in politics are just different ways of acheiving the <br/>\nsame end (improvement of conditions for people), while Green politics is <br/>\nabout something else altogether - it&#39;s about caring for the earth, <br/>\n(which of course includes people as well). So Green politics is actually <br/>\nneither left nor right, which is a little confusing for those who have <br/>\ngrown up thinking that all political ideas have to fall somewhere on the <br/>\nleft - right continuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we ask this about unschooling&#39;s place in homeschooling.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Where exactly is the line <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;between unschooling and not unschooling?<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Bridget<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s more than just a line, even for people who are on there <br/>\n&gt;way there, and pretty darn close.

Not on the school-at-home - eclectic - do nothing continuum, <br/>\nall aiming for the child to &#39;end up&#39; &#39;successfully educated&#39;, but <br/>\nrather, unschooling is in a different place altogether, aiming for the <br/>\nchild to &#39;continue being&#39; &#39;successfully who they are&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34370,"nextTopicId":34460}}
