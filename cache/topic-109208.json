Maybe <br/>\nI&#39;ll get another chance to see the top of a hook and ladder truck   ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo truly understand my interest, you have to realize that I am terrified of <br/>\nheights.

By the time I reached the top, I was shaking uncontrollably and <br/>\nhad to hold the handrail with a deathgrip so I didn&#39;t fall down the stairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie<br/>\n--<br/>\nwww.naturallynhkids.com<br/>\nGreat parenting is a great career!
