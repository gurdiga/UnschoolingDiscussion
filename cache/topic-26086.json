When I found it, it was freshly run over <br/>\nlengthwise by a car, quite dead but still &quot;warm&quot; (for a snake) and my teacher <br/>\nreally wanted me to throw it away, but no, it was educational and I was <br/>\nfascinated so I put it in a shoebox, took it home, and it eventually lived <br/>\n(stiffly) stuck above the horseshoe above the door of one of my dad&#39;s storage <br/>\nsheds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt mostly passed when I was 15 or so and able to give away some dolls and <br/>\nstuffed animals to younger female friends and neighbors.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an adult friend who personifies her furniture and cars, but she&#39;s not <br/>\na packrat, so when I see her name and talk to something and then just give it <br/>\naway or sell it, it makes her seem cold to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one of her old couches (given name unknown to me &lt;g&gt;).  She kept it <br/>\nsuper clean and all.  I let the dog use it to look out the front window, and <br/>\nHolly jumps on it.  My friend probably thinks I care less about it than she <br/>\ndid, but I&#39;m just giving it more freedom than she did!  A less structured <br/>\nlife.  It used to have scheduled baths and bedtimes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26006,"nextTopicId":25976}}
