I&#39;m <br/>\njust confused about how I get comfortable with just doing whatever the next <br/>\nthing is and do I have to keep entertaining them or will they ask for what <br/>\nthey need and if they don&#39;t will I be neglectful?

So we have <br/>\nthe right mix.  I have Zak in a preschool at the moment, but the more he&#39;s <br/>\nthere (and this is a school where all they do is play), the more <br/>\nuncomfortable I am with the idea of him going to something that&#39;s rigid and <br/>\ndecides what he learns and when.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback from you all would be great on how to allay my fears.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to reading more on this list and learning a lot<br/>\nDawn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9491,"nextTopicId":9501}}
