He argues that effective <br/>\ncommunication depends on a shared body of knowledge between the persons <br/>\ncommunicating. If someone is talking about cows, for example, what is said <br/>\nwill be unintelligible unless the person listening has some idea what a cow <br/>\nis, what it is good for, and in what contexts one might encounter one. In <br/>\nusing the word “cow”, Nørretranders says, the speaker has deliberately <br/>\nthrown away a huge body of information, though it remains implied. He <br/>\nillustrates the point with a story of Victor Hugo writing to his publisher to <br/>\nask how his most recent book, Les Miserables, was getting on. Hugo just wrote <br/>\n“?”, to which his publisher replied “!”, to indicate it was selling well. <br/>\nThe exchange would have no meaning to a third party because the shared <br/>\ncontext is unique to those taking part in it. This shared context Tor <br/>\nNørretranders calls exformation. He coined the word as a abbreviated form of <br/>\nexplicitly discarded information, originally in Danish as eksformation; the <br/>\nword first appeared in English in an article he wrote in 1992. He says <br/>\n“exformation is everything we do not actually say but have in our heads when <br/>\nor before we say anything at all. Information is the measurable, demonstrable <br/>\nutterance we actually come out with”.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the information content of a message alone, there is no way of measuring <br/>\nhow much exformation it contains.<br/>\n[Tor Nørretranders, The User Illusion (1998)]<br/>\n<br/>\nThought, argues Norretranders, is in fact a process of chucking away <br/>\ninformation, and it is this detritus (happily labelled “exformation”) that <br/>\nis crucially involved in “automatic” behaviours of expertise (riding a <br/>\nbicycle, playing the piano), and which is therefore the most precious to us <br/>\nas people.<br/>\n[Guardian, Sep. 1998]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57376,"nextTopicId":57514}}
