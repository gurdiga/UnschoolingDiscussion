I grew up in an addicted family, mother <br/>\nis an alcoholic, albeit functioning and father was (he died 13 years ago) a <br/>\nsex addict... For those of you unclear on sexual addiction (the biggest <br/>\naddiction we actually have in this country that&#39;s not talked about.... just <br/>\nlook at Bill Clinton)... Sex addiction can be anything from masturbation, <br/>\nvoyerismn, multiple sexual partners, rape, abuse, reading porno on the <br/>\ninternet, in magazines, in porn stores,... it&#39;s about getting a &quot;high&quot; <br/>\nfeeling from the act of being involved with something sexual.... Just wanted <br/>\nto clarify what it is...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother wasn&#39;t available emotionally, although she was there physically and <br/>\nmy father wasn&#39;t available in all ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chances of children becoming either addicts or codependents are extremely <br/>\nhigh if they are exposed to this behavior in the people that raise them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t advocate single parents and my belief is that children need role <br/>\nmodels of each sex for a physically, emotionally, spiritually and mentally <br/>\nhealthy upbringing.  However, one non-addcited person is better than one <br/>\nnon-addicted and one addicted together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI speak from the painful experience of recovering from drug and alcohol <br/>\naddiction myself 15 years ago.
