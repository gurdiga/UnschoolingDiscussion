I recently had to &quot;finish&quot; our <br/>\nbedroom floor which was bare grey concrete in order to appease an appraiser. I <br/>\nhad less than a week to do it, so not enough time to lay the tile that&#39;s sitting <br/>\nin the garage. Priced professionally coloring concrete and that was around <br/>\n$1000 and out of the question. So, I rag painted it a beautiful subtle sea blue <br/>\nw/paint I already had.  You just buy some painter&#39;s rags and some latex enamel <br/>\npaint or even milk paint...dip the rag in being careful to not soak it and <br/>\nwipe the floor in a circle or big swooping arks. Just rub it in and play w/it <br/>\nuntil you get the look you&#39;re happy with. It&#39;s so easy..like cleaning the floor. <br/>\nThen when you&#39;re finished let it sit a day or so to dry and then seal w/water <br/>\nbased sealer. I still have to seal ours and it&#39;s not wearing well (with four <br/>\nbig dogs and an active 5 1/2 yo) at all w/out sealer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\ndebbie~:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94512,"nextTopicId":94485}}
