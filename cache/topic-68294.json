They are not wanting a curriculum but may use a math book here <br/>\nand there.<br/>\nI also told them that they really need to allow plenty of time to deschool a <br/>\ngood year is possible maybe more. Also that if they truly deschool with the <br/>\nintent to Unschool they most likely will not return to school nor want too.<br/>\nOur son is unbelievable explaining what he does, what he has done and learned <br/>\nover this past year. <br/>\nNot sure if this little bit helps, be honest and maybe make a list before you <br/>\ngo in your mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269514,"authorName":"Betjeman and Barton Tea Merchants","from":"&quot;Betjeman and Barton Tea Merchants&quot; &lt;karen@...&gt;","profile":"anoontea","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] explaining unschooling to a new homeschooler","postDate":"1052516770","msgId":68332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWEwMWMzMTY3NCQ2N2M1MzI2MCRiYzM3ZmVhOUAxejVtcTAxPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFkNy45MDQ0ZWFhLjJiZWQ2ZDdiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68329,"nextInTopic":68382,"prevInTime":68331,"nextInTime":68333,"topicId":68294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think you should let her go to the library to check out The Unschooling Handbook (Mary Griffith) and THEN have them over for a Q & A session.
