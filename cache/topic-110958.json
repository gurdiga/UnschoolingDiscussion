I <br/>\ncannot always buy everything they want but we manage compromises <br/>\nmost of the time.  For example, my son&#39;s latest passion is watching <br/>\nEbay for Star Wars Lego kits auctions.  Those things are expensive!  <br/>\nIn the month before Christmas, I spent $150 on 2 Lego kits.  At the <br/>\nsame time, I was purchasing Christmas gifts (more Lego sets).  Now <br/>\nhe&#39;s been telling me about some kit that costs $300.  Egads!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can only be as active as they&#39;ll allow me to be.  My son <br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t like involving me too much.  He hates asking for <br/>\nhelp.  We&#39;re trying to help him see it&#39;s not a weakness or a flaw to <br/>\nneed another person.  I do as much as he lets me.  My daughter has <br/>\nbeen the same way.  Even when she demanded that I teach her how to <br/>\nread, she really meant for me to sit quietly while she figured it <br/>\nout.  And that&#39;s exactly what we did!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, I&#39;m here when they need me.  Thanks for the book <br/>\nrecommendation as well.  To be honest, I don&#39;t recall learning much <br/>\nHistory in high school.  I vaguely recall a Civics class because I <br/>\nremember playing a Jeopardy like game in the classroom.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember any History at all.  That&#39;s one reason I&#39;ve thoroughly <br/>\nenjoyed reading History alongside the kids.

I also love Barnes & Noble, but only the <br/>\nchildren&#39;s and teacher sections.  I loved school through 7th grade.  <br/>\nHigh School began at 8th grade and that&#39;s when I started disliking <br/>\nschool.  I had some really bad teachers.

Basically, I end up buying curriculum <br/>\nbecause *I&#39;m* bored and want something to do with my children that <br/>\nwill be fun and educational.

My son has been making his own choices of what to do.  <br/>\nHe spends most of his time playing Nintendo (some with me and some <br/>\nwithout me), surfing the &#39;net, watching tv and playing Legos.

We&#39;ve been busy with the holidays and we just got back <br/>\ninto town from a trip.  My DH and dd7 are still on vacation from <br/>\nwork and school so we&#39;re just kicking back and enjoying family <br/>\ntime.  Most of the stuff I plan to sell hasn&#39;t been used in months <br/>\nanyway.  Some of it is in boxes in my closet and some is on a <br/>\nbookshelf in my bedroom.  The things we&#39;ve had out are things my son <br/>\nchose back in mid-November when I took him out of school again.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to get rid of his Math things, but he would like to <br/>\nsell the writing things I&#39;ve had on hand for months.  He&#39;s been <br/>\nwanting to read about the Middle Ages and he&#39;d like to sift through <br/>\nthe things I bought to see what looks interesting.  The whole point <br/>\nis that we want to keep anything we find interesting!  Also, my dd7 <br/>\nmay be in school right now but there are some things that she wants <br/>\nto keep as well.

My name is Beth.  I <br/>\nlive in Georgia with my DH and 3 children.  My kids are dd13, ds9 <br/>\nand dd7.  Right now, only my 9 year old son is homeschooling.  I <br/>\nshare custody of my oldest daughter with her dad (he and his wife <br/>\nare school teachers) and she has never been homeschooled.  My 7 year <br/>\nold is in 2nd grade at the local public school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe began our homeschooling journey in early 2002 when we took our <br/>\nson out of ps Kindergarten.  We started with a traditional boxed <br/>\ncurriculum which turned out to be a horrid expensive mistake.  We <br/>\nthen learned about unschooling and moved into a relaxed lifestyle <br/>\nthat left all the pressures of school behind.  Sometime during that <br/>\nyear, I discovered a literature based curriculum and started <br/>\nborrowing books from its catalog.  Then I decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt <br/>\nto just jump in and do a whole program.  I&#39;ve been curriculum <br/>\nhopping since that time.  I&#39;m sad to say I reached a point last <br/>\nOctober where I felt totally overwhelmed with life and put my two <br/>\nyoungest children back in school.  My ds9 was against the whole <br/>\nthing and hated it from the 1st day.  My dd7, otoh, was very excited <br/>\nto be going to school.  She&#39;s a social butterfly and says that being <br/>\nhome is very boring.  She wants to be around a bunch of kids all day <br/>\nevery day.  I took my son out after 13 days.  He is so much happier <br/>\nat home.  My daughter isn&#39;t ready to quit though.  I thought for <br/>\nsure that she&#39;d decide to remain home after the holiday break but <br/>\nshe is eager to return this week.  I must say I feel terribly <br/>\ndisappointed.  She said she&#39;d quit if I really wanted her to quit <br/>\nbut that she&#39;d rather stay in for a while.  My DH wants me to leave <br/>\nher in until she decides to come home on her own.  I&#39;d feel better <br/>\nabout that decision if she loved every day, but she comes home 2 - 3 <br/>\ndays per week in tears because she&#39;s had a bad day.  I&#39;ve asked her <br/>\nhow I can make homeschooling more appealing again but she says there <br/>\nisn&#39;t anything I can do and that she&#39;d rather stay in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve jumped around in homeschooling methods, trying to find that <br/>\nperfect fit.  Most of the time we begin something enthusiastically, <br/>\nonly to have it fizzle out within a few weeks.  When I look deep <br/>\nwithin myself, I see it&#39;s always me pushing though, and my kids just <br/>\ntrying to please me.  We get to a point where we&#39;re all unhappy so I <br/>\nstop schooling so we can catch our breath and just live happily.  <br/>\nYet, I always find my way back to curriculum.  I realize this is a <br/>\nbad cycle that must be broken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just finished reading my favorite homeschooling book, <br/>\n_Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves_ by Alison <br/>\nMcKee.  I seem to go back to this book whenever I feel a need to be <br/>\ninspired yet again about homeschooling.  Every time I read this <br/>\nbook, I&#39;m reminded of how steeped I am in traditional education.  <br/>\nEach time I feel like I&#39;ve finally let it go, only to find myself <br/>\ndrawn back to it all.  So I guess we&#39;re now back in a deschooling <br/>\nmode.  My son and I are thinking about rounding up all the <br/>\ncurriculum in the house and selling everything we don&#39;t like.  We <br/>\nalso need a hobby and we&#39;re looking into geocaching.  We&#39;re not big <br/>\noutdoor people but my son likes the idea of &#39;treasure&#39; hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this far!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110967,"nextTopicId":32224}}
