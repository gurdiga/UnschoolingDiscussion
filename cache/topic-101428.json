Oy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, another young woman who had gotten on at Hampshire (very  hippy-ish, <br/>\n&quot;typical&quot; Hampshire student &lt;g&gt;) immediately jumped forward  and extended her <br/>\nhand to the woman, asking, &quot;Are you OK?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was  such a small act of kindness and it hit me *really* hard--made me <br/>\nashamed for  my feelings at the time and was such a clear lesson in what to do if <br/>\nsomeone  is hurt or embarrassed in public.  It also made me realize how cruel <br/>\nmy  public school peers were and how cruel I had become.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat woman  was such a good example to me--I&#39;ve never forgotten her.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know  that many of the students at Hampshire were homeschooled, and maybe <br/>\nthat young  woman wasn&#39;t one of them, but it strikes me that that sort of <br/>\nbehavior might  be more common among kids who&#39;ve avoided the dog-eat-dog mentality <br/>\nof public  school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for letting me reminisce.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy  S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************************************<br/>\nIt probably didn&#39;t have to have anything to do with whether she was  <br/>\nhomeschooled or public schooled or whatever.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy experience there was that it was so different from public high school,  <br/>\nand that the people were so happy it was, it led to more sane behavior. Yeah,  <br/>\nthere were lots of drugs and some alcohol there (early 80&#39;s), but unlike my  <br/>\nfriends at UMass or even Amherst College, the students were really into learning <br/>\n and exploring. Not just &quot;The Next Step on the Path.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOne story: after I graduated I volunteered for the Admissions office for a  <br/>\nwhile doing interviews for students who wanted them or were required to have  <br/>\nthem. Most weren&#39;t required, but for special circumstances they were.<br/>\n <br/>\nI got one kid who would have been an easy Yes for most schools. He was top  <br/>\nfive in his class, straight A&#39;s, jock, Eagle Scout, wanted to do  computers.  <br/>\nHampshire was requiring an interview because they were  concerned he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nbe a good fit. They mostly wanted to get a good answer to  &quot;Why Hampshire?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nHe was this cool kid who talked about his parents meeting at Woodstock and  <br/>\nthat while he was very, very good at traditional school he wanted to go to a  <br/>\nplace where he could actually learn something about the world and about <br/>\nhimself.  He knew that Hampshire wasn&#39;t the prestige place for computers but that the <br/>\n resources were there.  He got in, and he loved it.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191519185,"authorName":"huntmom1996","from":"&quot;huntmom1996&quot; &lt;huntmom1996@...&gt;","profile":"huntmom1996","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hampshire College","postDate":"1101735074","msgId":101429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNvZjhiMitidDB1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101428,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":101428,"nextInTime":101430,"topicId":101428,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is a funny coincidence, I was at the park with my dd (who s only 7!) and a youg man with his son, about 2, was asking about her.
