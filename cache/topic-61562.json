I have not forbidden my children to sell their <br/>\nbodies on Central Avenue.  They know about prostitution.  Holly and I once <br/>\nhad twenty minutes to kill waiting to do something in that neighborhood, and <br/>\nI took her cruising to see prostitutes.  The only one we saw was a <br/>\ntransvestite, black male, NICE legs, pretty dress.  She had me go around the <br/>\ncorner and pass by again and tell her how I had first noticed it was a man.  <br/>\nWig is no proof.  Legs and posture.  Arm muscles.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean Holly will be out there next?   I didn&#39;t tell her she should <br/>\nor shouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an extreme and true example.  Let&#39;s bypass all the little examples and <br/>\ngo straight to a wild and crazy one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this same family in which the kids know prostitution exists has ZERO kids <br/>\nwho have expressed an interest in making some extra money that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve seen cigarettes.  Smelled them.  Not liked it.  <br/>\nWhen they visit a home where there are cigarette smokers, they&#39;ll come home <br/>\nand take their clothes off and say &quot;MOM, please wash this stuff, it stinks.&quot;  <br/>\nWhen their grandmother used to sew for them and send clothes, the very first <br/>\nthing when we opened the box, out came a cloud of cigarette stench because <br/>\nshe smokes while she sews and it gets all into the cloth.  The last couple of <br/>\npackages, we just opened by the washing machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I forbid them to smoke?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t be NEARLY as effective as their own freely made decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with drinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to forbid things when you discuss principles and live a <br/>\nprincipled life.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then that statement won&#39;t make sense to someone whose principles involve <br/>\nraising and protecting children from worldly influences, political <br/>\ncorrectness, and the influence of Satan.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another reason I don&#39;t think unschooling can work for everyone.

Then there was a marathon or something and a bunch of shows were on during the day and he asked me to watch them with him.

And it turns out that they rarely watch TV apart from a few shows like Stargate, Tracker, Red Dwarf and the Simpsons.<br/>\nMy 10 yo has just started watching The Daily Show (satirical news) and there will be lots of one -offs like Children of Dune. They never watch cartoons which I find a bit bizarre given that they are 10,<br/>\n9 and 7.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve just joined Netflix so the other day they were trawling through that and picking out movies and ordering them.
