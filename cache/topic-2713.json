Unschool = NOT school.<br/>\n&gt; And we do NOT<br/>\n&gt; school at my house.  We have fun and learn.  That is why I have chosen the<br/>\n&gt; term Natural<br/>\n&gt; Learners to describe what we do.  It doesn&#39;t smack of the 60s (unhip<br/>\n&gt; uncool ungroovy<br/>\n&gt; unschool).  It is a natural term that describes a natural process.  You<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need to get hung up<br/>\n&gt; on positions of authority.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some of which I could have chosen to take personal offence to - being the<br/>\nage I am - a teenager in the 60&#39;s and all &lt;g&gt;  The sort of unschooling<br/>\ntalked about on Unschooling.com is a lot more than just &lt;Unschool+NOT<br/>\nschool&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt Linda was just asking you about aspects of your style of unschooling<br/>\nthat are different from the styles of many other unschoolers, and those<br/>\ntalked about on Unschooling.com..<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also said, in 2 different posts<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The whole issue of &quot;pushing&quot; at our house is a non-issue.  There<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; be parents who want to nudge their kids some and there may be others who<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t.  It is definitely a parental perogative.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Everybody needs a little push now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, it is a parental perogative. So is the style of homeschooling. This<br/>\nlist is for discussing unschooling. Discussion, I thought, involved a<br/>\nconversation of some sort, not just a whole lot of people making statements<br/>\nwhich are never commented on? I like to read what others do, ask questions,<br/>\nthen decide if I stick to my original view, or change in light of new ideas<br/>\nand information. And having done that in this case, I have to admit that I<br/>\ndo push my kids sometimes. But what I hoped to find on this list was support<br/>\nfor trying to learn to become a more unschooling homeschooler and that is in<br/>\nfact what I assumed the purpose of the list  was. I cannot for the life of<br/>\nme see how pushing can be part of unschooling.  Perhaps we have a different<br/>\ndefinition of pushing? Perhaps to you it means the same as guidance? But I<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t want to ask you to explain how that works for you in a<br/>\nunschooling context now, because I feel that you would be likely to take it<br/>\nas criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I knew very well that I was introducing ideas that some people would frown<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; on,<br/>\n&gt; but I can&#39;t let that stop me from being honest in my post, nor can I let<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s pushing their opinions on me sway me from what I intend on doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe Linda was pushing her opinions on you. And I don&#39;t see much<br/>\npoint of being on a list unless I am interested in listening to others<br/>\nopinions, with the possibilitity in mind that they *might* sway me because<br/>\nthey *might* have more experience, or knowledge or insight than me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Perhaps Linda&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; reaction was because she thought I was dissing what unschooling is about.<br/>\n&gt; I am NOT.<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is NOT unguided.  It is guidance with the highest awareness of<br/>\n&gt; sensitivity to the<br/>\n&gt; kids.  It is allowing kids to learn by living. (It is Yoda style<br/>\n&gt; guidance!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Assuming you mean &#39;discussing&#39;? That&#39;s just it. You&#39;re not &#39;discussing&#39;. You<br/>\nmade statements about what you think unschooling is, but rejected<br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I JUST want to visit and share with parents who unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me too. But I have nowhere, ever, in the 13 and a half years I&#39;ve been<br/>\nhomeschooling and trying to unschool, seeing &#39;pushing&#39; described as part of<br/>\nunschooling. Which is why I said &lt;in terms of the descriptions of<br/>\nunschooling found on the Unschooling.com website I thought Linda&#39;s questions<br/>\nwere perfectly reasonable. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems like<br/>\n&gt; neither you nor Linda want me around.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a matter of not wanting you personally D.J., around. I don&#39;t own<br/>\nthis list, so it&#39;s not for me to say. But over the years I have seen many<br/>\nsupport groups, and more recently e-mail lists start out with one focus and<br/>\nthen change focus, so that, in the case of the support groups anyway, the<br/>\npeople that wanted the original focus have had to go away and start anew.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is tempting to just leave, but<br/>\n&gt; then I might miss out on some good friendships, including ones with you<br/>\n&gt; and Linda.  Perhaps I am misinterpreting your comments, but it seems<br/>\n&gt; hard to give them any other spin other than the critizisms they either<br/>\n&gt; imply or directly state.  It is also entirely possible that I have<br/>\n&gt; misread your intent and am being overly defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am a vegetarian, and I write poetry, and I make hand bound books, I&#39;m into<br/>\nhomeopathy and natural therapies and homebirth and child-led weaning and we<br/>\nhave just bought some land that we are going to build on and develop along<br/>\npermaculture lines and ...... but I don&#39;t expect to discuss them here. Nor<br/>\ndo I expect to discuss structured curriculum or &#39;pushing&#39;. Except maybe to<br/>\nask help and support when I feel a surge of pushiness descending on me &lt;g&gt; I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want or intend to criticise you. Homeschoolers are by nature a strong<br/>\nminded lot. But if we can&#39;t question or discuss statements about the nature<br/>\nof unschooling, as Linda did, then what&#39;s the point of an &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>\ndiscussion list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;There are as<br/>\n&gt; many different ways of defining unschooling as<br/>\n&gt;                  there are people doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep. But I still believe there are some things that just aren&#39;t<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39;. Many of which find a place in my life, to my regret. But if<br/>\nyou eat meat only once a week, it is still intrinsically incorrect to claim<br/>\nthat that is vegetarian behaviour. The lines are far more blurred with<br/>\nunschooling but I still believe that blurry though they may be, discussing<br/>\nthe lines is part of what this list is about.

Although I,<br/>\n&gt; too, found D.J.&#39;s description of &quot;pushing&quot; and &quot;requiring&quot; a little more<br/>\n&gt; schoolish than unschoolish, I don&#39;t feel she deserved the reaction that she<br/>\n&gt; received.  In fact, haven&#39;t many of us been through that phase of feeling<br/>\n&gt; there are things our children &quot;ought&quot; to be doing, and if they aren&#39;t doing<br/>\n&gt; it for love, they need to do it for (fill in the blank)____, (self<br/>\n&gt; discipline, practice, progress, keeping up, fulfilling my needs, etc.).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I certainly don&#39;t think D.J. was trying to change the tone or focus of the<br/>\n&gt; list.  But D.J., I don&#39;t think anyone was suggesting that you would be<br/>\n&gt; unwelcome.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I went back to reread some unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; posts from the links you gave me, and the one I read was, &quot;There are as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; many different ways of defining unschooling as<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                  there are people doing it. Reading through what various<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                  people have to say about it may help you to a better<br/>\n&gt; &gt;                  understanding, or at least be interesting and make you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling spans the spectrum from &quot;just&quot; not using a packaged curriculum<br/>\n&gt; to uninvolvement in the child&#39;s activities.  Few of us consider that<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is either of these extremes.  What is interesting and exciting<br/>\n&gt; about this list is the different views of what our children need in terms of<br/>\n&gt; learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t speak for Linda, but I wonder if her comments to you, D.J.  might<br/>\n&gt; have been more acceptable if they had been worded more diplomatically.  I,<br/>\n&gt; too, thought that her tone was terse, although I would have asked the same<br/>\n&gt; questions about why you feel the need to &quot;push.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Many of us have evolved from school-at-home to unschooling.  I cringe when I<br/>\n&gt; remember what I required of my children in my first couple of years<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling.  I don&#39;t think we should jump all over newbies who tell us<br/>\n&gt; what they are doing and are asking for honest feedback.

I don&#39;t have any problem with how you are raising<br/>\nyour kids.<br/>\nI knew very well that I was introducing ideas that some people would<br/>\nfrown on, but I can&#39;t let that stop me from being honest in my post, nor<br/>\ncan I let people&#39;s pushing their opinions on me sway me from what I<br/>\nintend on doing.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it seems to me, D.J that you didn&#39;t like the tone of Linda&#39;s<br/>\nquestions, yet they seemed quite reasonable to me in the context of this<br/>\nlist. How we each define unschooling is own own business as is how we<br/>\nbring up our children. However, this list is, and I quote from the<br/>\nonelist description:<br/>\n<br/>\nDescription<br/>\n              This is a networking and discussion list for the<br/>\nUnschooling.com website.<br/>\n              For more information:<br/>\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Now, in terms of the descriptions of unschooling found on the<br/>\nUnschooling.com website I thought Linda&#39;s questions were perfectly<br/>\nreasonable. This is the 2nd time since this list started not long ago<br/>\nthat this sort of discussion has arisen, and the same thing has happened<br/>\non another list I was on. I&#39;m relatively new to internet and lists, so<br/>\nperhaps those who have been around longer than I could clarify. Is it<br/>\nusual for a list to start with a particular focus, and then to have<br/>\npeople join and complain about it having that focus?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jane E.","from":"&quot;Jane E.&quot; &lt;jaelise@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ZOOdcORbZ9sf_6-f2TVfG2RA1iK9pNT_PbC8PWYZjJTfdY027vbpxoebrbq0SfiQV06Dxd9CxYNMarmQ9STCY2B-R0618lumvRAa","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: What is unschooling?","postDate":"936726067","msgId":2716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xOTQuMjcxNi45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2715,"nextInTopic":2723,"prevInTime":2715,"nextInTime":2717,"topicId":2713,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Although I,<br/>\ntoo, found D.J.&#39;s description of &quot;pushing&quot; and &quot;requiring&quot; a little more<br/>\nschoolish than unschoolish, I don&#39;t feel she deserved the reaction that she<br/>\nreceived.  In fact, haven&#39;t many of us been through that phase of feeling<br/>\nthere are things our children &quot;ought&quot; to be doing, and if they aren&#39;t doing<br/>\nit for love, they need to do it for (fill in the blank)____, (self<br/>\ndiscipline, practice, progress, keeping up, fulfilling my needs, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t think D.J. was trying to change the tone or focus of the<br/>\nlist.  But D.J., I don&#39;t think anyone was suggesting that you would be<br/>\nunwelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I went back to reread some unschooling<br/>\n&gt; posts from the links you gave me, and the one I read was, &quot;There are as<br/>\n&gt; many different ways of defining unschooling as<br/>\n&gt;                  there are people doing it. Reading through what various<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;                  people have to say about it may help you to a better<br/>\n&gt;                  understanding, or at least be interesting and make you<br/>\n&gt; think!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling spans the spectrum from &quot;just&quot; not using a packaged curriculum<br/>\nto uninvolvement in the child&#39;s activities.  Few of us consider that<br/>\nunschooling is either of these extremes.  What is interesting and exciting<br/>\nabout this list is the different views of what our children need in terms of<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t speak for Linda, but I wonder if her comments to you, D.J.  might<br/>\nhave been more acceptable if they had been worded more diplomatically.  I,<br/>\ntoo, thought that her tone was terse, although I would have asked the same<br/>\nquestions about why you feel the need to &quot;push.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of us have evolved from school-at-home to unschooling.  I cringe when I<br/>\nremember what I required of my children in my first couple of years<br/>\nhomeschooling.  I don&#39;t think we should jump all over newbies who tell us<br/>\nwhat they are doing and are asking for honest feedback.  Let&#39;s all try to<br/>\nkeep our tones a little more gentle.<br/>\n<br/>\nJane<br/>\nThe Meddler</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42055,"nextTopicId":42062}}
