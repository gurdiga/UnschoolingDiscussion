All the friends are invited here..open door invitation...and they have been here for a couple of days (except at night).<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we got movies (8 mile, Sweet Home Alabama, and Crossroads) and watched movies, and ate food...lots and lots of food.  It was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed being with the kids.  I&#39;ve got another one calling me &quot;mom&quot; now. LOL.  (By the way 8 Mile is a very interesting movie.  It explains so much of Eminem&#39;s lyrics.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then today, they washed the dishes for me (for a small fee, but I was GLAD to pay it with all those dishes!!!).  I really have to invest in paper cups and plates, etc. LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...I took them ALL to the skatepark.  We squeezed 8 kids in the suburban and left.  The kids were aged 7 to 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t do any skating (too many older pros), but they sure had a great time.  They were rolling down the grassy hill, racing, doing gymnastics, and went exploring in the woods.  They were playing in a water pipe and the park ranger had to tell them to stop &lt;smirk&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home they were cranking up the music and waving at people on the highway LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they&#39;re outside hanging out, not sure what they&#39;re up to at the moment but I can still hear them. <br/>\n<br/>\nTomorrow I&#39;m going to ask that they come over a little later in the day so that we can have family visit and not have a lot of ruckus goin&#39; on.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told the kids over and over again that I want them to hang out here where its safe.  They know I won&#39;t get in their hair.  And I&#39;m collaborating on how we can make this the kind of hang out they&#39;d like to come to...instead of wandering around town bored.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully they&#39;ll give me more ideas after this weekend.  Now, to find parts for a go-kart......<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65444,"nextTopicId":65447}}
