I am learning much from the death of my<br/>\naunt.  She got engaged Saturday night and was killed Sunday morning while<br/>\nriding on the back of her fiance&#39;s motorcycle.  I can&#39;t continue to spend<br/>\nthe amount of time on the computer that I have been, and my home business is<br/>\ntaking enough computer time as it is.  I will likely search for a lower<br/>\nvolume unschooling list in a few months, but for now I need to curl up with<br/>\nmy babies and live and play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thank you for the ideas and support both in parenting and unschooling, and<br/>\nthe help with finding words for my cousins&#39; journals.  I&#39;ve learned a lot in<br/>\nthe few months I&#39;ve been on this  list.  I look forward to meeting many of<br/>\nyou IRL at the Live and Learn conference this August.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith care, <br/>\nKristi <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi Hayes<br/>\n<br/>\nMamatoto Advocate<br/>\n<br/>\nGypsyMama.com<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyful mama to Morgaine, Orion, and Isaac<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are no great things, only small things with great love.
