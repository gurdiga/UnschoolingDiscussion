Maybe <br/>\nbecause I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s meant as a question, or advice to others, or <br/>\nneither? It seems like some kind of edgy challenge to everyone else, with all the <br/>\ncomments about &quot;honesty&quot; and not lying, and denigrating television <br/>\n<br/>\n       If it is a sincere search to &quot;find that balance&quot; by bringing it here, <br/>\nmaybe some descriptions of how your children do or don&#39;t respond to tv, what <br/>\nthey are or aren&#39;t missing by watching, and/or telling the list whether you <br/>\nwatch with them or plot to forcibly unplug them with your clandestine copy of <br/>\nGatto behind your back &lt;g&gt; would be less offensive and more useful?
