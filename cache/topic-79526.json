It&#39;s mostly raptors, but they <br/>\nrehabilitate ANYTHING wild (injured turtles, foxes, opossums, bobcats, bunnies). <br/>\nThey know about me: I get all their domestic rabbits. When the novelty has <br/>\nworn off, some folks think that they can just release a domestic bunny out into <br/>\nthe wild---or that they can drop it of at Wildlife Care. But since they aren&#39;t <br/>\nwild and I have a bunny cage....   Anyway, you might try asking around for <br/>\nsomething similar---or STARTING something similar. Ours was started with grants. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a small building with a lot of cages (mostly dog crates and bird cages).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m SURE that if your son would start one, he could get plenty of press <br/>\ncoverage, grants, donations, and volunteers as well as info and assistance from the <br/>\nzoo (and not just your own). He would need special permission of some sort to <br/>\nhandle raptors as it&#39;s illegal to posess many of the birds of prey--or even a <br/>\nfeather!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe organization here is Wildlife Care of Carolina.  5551 Bush River Road <br/>\nColumbia, SC 29212   (803) 772 3994. I can&#39;t imagine that they wouldn&#39;t agree to <br/>\ntalk with you and answer questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also know of a wolf rehab group in North Carolina. I&#39;m sure that if you <br/>\nasked around, you&#39;ll find others nearby with the same interest and SOMEONE <br/>\nwilling to give him a leg up. I know that Wildlife Care is always in need of money <br/>\nAND volunteers!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for animal TRAINING, he might want to look into movies. If there are any <br/>\nmovies made in your area, there&#39;s bound to be a wrangler. Hook up with one. <br/>\nAgree to kennel sit/scoop poop/water & feed the animals during the week when most <br/>\nkids are in school. All that will also work with dog breeders. We often need <br/>\nsomeone to &quot;man the kennel&quot; during a show weekend. With some time, he could <br/>\nsoon be GOING to the shows as an assistant and handling the dogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen&#39;s recently gotten into falconry and has been training raptors----she can <br/>\ngive some info there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn ability to handle and understand animals is another one of those <br/>\n&quot;intelligences&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!

She is trying to volunteer at our <br/>\nvet&#39;s office. She spends time at a local wildlife rescue/refuge as well. Her Girl <br/>\nScout leader works there and is a contact for people who have found injured <br/>\nwildlife, or need opossums, raccoons, etc. removed from their homes, garages, <br/>\nsheds and whatnot. She is the person who got Moly involved in caring for <br/>\nanimals at the nature center. At this time, they are feeding both a bald and golden <br/>\neagle, a turkey vulture, two coyote pups, an orphaned fawn, various snakes, <br/>\nturtles, a cross eyed opossum, and other small birds. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe participates in the local Audubon society, going on bird watching walks, <br/>\nand some of the &quot;field trips&quot; (for lack of a better word) they offer. We also <br/>\ngo to K-State every now and then to go through the vet school where she can <br/>\nask questions, and out to the Kanza Prairie. She also participates in some of <br/>\nour local zoo&#39;s educational programs, and although she likes most of the <br/>\nprograms, she isn&#39;t too happy with the zoo. Lately they have had some problems and <br/>\nhave been under investigation at various times in the past few years. But, to <br/>\ntheir credit, they are working very hard at improving the conditions for the <br/>\nanimals; expanding habitats, making the habitats more natural and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things Moly does is read tons and tons of books on anything animal <br/>\nrelated, and watch as much Animal Planet as her heart desires. Some of her <br/>\nfavorite shows are The Crocodile Hunter (and all the spin-offs of that) The Jeff <br/>\nCorwin Experience, and Animal Cops. The last one is kind of heart wrenching to <br/>\nwatch, and depending on her mood, Moly will say she wants to be a vet, so she can <br/>\nhelp the animals on the show. An animal cop, so she can rescue the animals <br/>\nand arrest people who mistreat the animals, both a vet and a cop, because <br/>\nsometimes the animals need both at the same time. And sometimes she gets so upset <br/>\nover some horror, she just wants to do to the people the same things they do to <br/>\nthe animals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis past summer, she found out about a protest of a local pet store chain <br/>\nbecause of their known practice of buying and selling puppy mill puppies and she <br/>\nwanted to participate, so she did. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many, many things a person can do. Look for nature centers, <br/>\nwildlife rescues, zoos, shelters, vets... anyone who welcomes volunteers. Keep an eye <br/>\nout for injured wildlife on walks, but be careful because injured animals <br/>\ntend to bite, some carry rabies and bubonic plague. Raccoons tend to be rabid, <br/>\nprairie dogs and gophers tend to carry the plague, crows tend to carry the west <br/>\nNile virus. Also, know that in some areas birds with injured wings are iffy. <br/>\nIf the wing is repairable and the bird could be returned to the wild, then they <br/>\nare, but there are some new laws that state that birds with wings that have <br/>\nto be amputated or are otherwise useless cannot be used as teaching birds <br/>\nanymore, but must be euthanized. So don&#39;t be discouraged if that is the case in <br/>\nyour area too. Another thing to be aware of is local and state wildlife laws, if <br/>\nyour son is a &quot;collector&quot; of pets know that sometimes some animals are <br/>\nendangered or protected. Our state reptile, the box turtle, is protected. When my <br/>\nkids find one on the road, we let them keep it for a few days to check that it is <br/>\nhealthy and not in need of vet attention. Then we release them far out in the <br/>\ncountry or at the nature center, as it is illegal to keep them, no matter <br/>\nthat the kids really want one as a pet! <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to your son!<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nWe call them dumb animals, and so they are, for they cannot tell us how they <br/>\nfeel, but they do not suffer less because they have no words. <br/>\nAnna Sewell <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Animal Trainers","postDate":"1062301038","msgId":79526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJpcnFoZStkcTIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79532,"prevInTime":79525,"nextInTime":79527,"topicId":79526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all.
