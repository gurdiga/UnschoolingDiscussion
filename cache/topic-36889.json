But nevertheless there&#39;s still the obstacle of overcoming the age-old tradition of having that piece of paper from the STATE.  <br/>\n  I know a lot of people are aware of the quality of education that a person gets from homeschooling by far exceeds the state&#39;s efforts, BUT this is still going to be an issue that we have to deal with.

I am sorry if I have offended you by my opinions. I just really value parents having the right to make decisions regarding their children freely, and without intimidation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1.. S.B. 88, the Senate version of H.B. 1435, creates a new big government program called &quot; Learning Gateway&quot; and will involve &quot;developing strategies for offering hospital visits or home visits by trained staff to new mothers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  2.. Upset by the defeat of H.B. 1435, Senate Majority Leader John McKay has pushed S.B. 88 into a fast track. He has pulled it from committee and sent it directly to the floor by &quot;special order.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  3.. The purpose of S.B. 88 is to &quot;screen&quot; children from birth to age 9 for &quot;biological, environmental, and behavioral risks,&quot; and &quot;learning problems.&quot; Furthermore, Learning Gateway providers will conduct &quot;intake with families,&quot; conduct &quot;needs/strength-based assessments of families,&quot; and &quot;make referrals for needed services&quot; and &quot;developmental monitoring.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  4.. This will all be done in &quot;collaboration&quot; with the Florida Department of Children and Family Services and numerous other big government agencies and programs.<br/>\n<br/>\n( Ok, if you don&#39;t live in Florida you may not be aware of what Florida Department of Children and Family Services is capable of)<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently like a little over a year ago, they &quot;misplaced&quot; a 5 year old girl in South Florida... only they just realized they don&#39;t know where she is... They regularly place children in homes where the &quot;Foster&quot; family, who is supposed to be screened, but often is not, severely hurts or kills the child... there&#39;s more but I think you get the idea. But this is the dept that will head this up.<br/>\n  1.. S.B. 86 and 88 mandates automatic referrals of high-risk newborns to the local Learning Gateway through the Office of Vital Statistics. Who determines what is considered &quot;high risk&quot;? There is no parental consent required for this referral. What happens if the parent chooses not to follow up on this referral?<br/>\n<br/>\n  2.. S.B. 86 and 88 direct that screening processes be developed and tested to address social/emotional/behavioral indicators which could be signs of future problems. Will the Florida Department of Children and Families take the child away if the parent chooses to follow his own doctor&#39;s advice instead of the government&#39;s?<br/>\n<br/>\n  3.. S.B. 86 and 88 require that an electronic data system be developed to track children who are screened, assessed, and referred for services. Will parents be able to remove the child from the government programs once the initial screening is done without their consent?<br/>\n<br/>\n  4.. S.B 86 and 88 create a huge, expensive bureaucracy, with the intent of expanding the program statewide. The pilot project is $6 million the first year for only three counties---what will it cost taxpayers to fund this program for the whole state?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis bill is currently known as S.B. 1844 and is sitting on the Gov&#39;s desk waiting for his decision. I am sorry if legal issues are not interesting to you. They are to me. I want to help insure that we, parents and homeschoolers like are free to raise our children the way we see fit. I want the freedom to refuse unnessasary medical treatment for my children. You really need to see the whole picture with the state and children. Not just Florida but the US. They already think they own our children, and that they are allowing us to take care of them for a while... this is looking like just another step towards their desire to control our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Legislative heads up","postDate":"1020954113","msgId":36904,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3OC44MTFjNTgzLjJhMGJlMDAxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36902,"nextInTopic":36906,"prevInTime":36903,"nextInTime":36905,"topicId":36889,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/9/02 8:13:17 AM, bacwoodz@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-887602499\">In a message dated 5/9/02 8:13:17 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bacwoodz@...\">bacwoodz@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It has nothing to do with achieveing proper standards in education - <br/>\nbecause as is clear homeschoolers far surpass the state standards, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because the average test scores of homeschoolers who take tests are <br/>\nhigh, on average, that doesn&#39;t mean individuals within that group take a pass <br/>\non it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because my family can document the heck out of our unschooling if <br/>\nnecessary doesn&#39;t mean that a negligent family where the kids are getting no <br/>\nparental attention doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccreditation isn&#39;t new, so I don&#39;t understand why it would even be a topic <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMANY colleges have for years held applicants up or back for having diplomas <br/>\nfrom sub-standard schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it is all about CONTROL.

Between that bill and the ones such as this diploma thing - I think it has nothing to do with the state making sure we have correctly educated our children - because it is clear that homeschoolers tend to be better educated than their public school peers. It is merely a matter of control. By requiring a specific diploma from an accredited institution they are trying to gain control. This was the same with the issues in CT. The legislatures were stating that their intent for their bill was to keep homeschoolers from using older siblings to babysit younger ones - or taking in foster children for the same reason. It was ridiculous. It has nothing to do with achieveing proper standards in education - because as is clear homeschoolers far surpass the state standards, it is all about CONTROL.

Most homeschooled kids have surpassed that by leaps and bounds.  But nevertheless there&#39;s still the obstacle of overcoming the age-old tradition of having that piece of paper from the STATE.  <br/>\n    I know a lot of people are aware of the quality of education that a person gets from homeschooling by far exceeds the state&#39;s efforts, BUT this is still going to be an issue that we have to deal with.  I can see the concern of those of us who homeschool and KNOW that our children are better educated that anything the state has turned out, yet are going to be turned away by many because the STATE has not sanctioned it.<br/>\n    Betty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

As home schoolers we can<br/>\nnever relax!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCrosswalk.com HomeSchool Channel - The Alarming Saga of House Bill 3364<br/>\n(A special thanks to SCAIHS&#39; attorney Ken Wingate and HSLDA attorney Dee<br/>\nBlack for their collaborative efforts in composing this article.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Discovery of House Bill 3364<br/>\n<br/>\nThe home schooling community in South Carolina has a team of people who are<br/>\ncommitted to the process of protecting parental rights in the South Carolina<br/>\nGeneral Assembly. We have legal counsel in Washington, legal counsel in<br/>\nSouth Carolina, grassroots activists, and home schooling advocates who<br/>\nconstantly monitor and analyze pending legislation. In addition, many of us<br/>\nwork diligently to maintain a positive and visible presence at the state<br/>\ncapitol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral weeks ago Tandy Collier (home schooling mother and support group<br/>\nleader from the Upstate) asked me to take a look at a bill, which had<br/>\nalready passed the entire State House of Representatives and was currently<br/>\nresiding in the Senate Education Committee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I read through the text of H. 3364, I was amazed, flabbergasted, and<br/>\nappalled at what I was reading. I took a deep breath and read the bill<br/>\nagain, thinking that somehow it would become more palatable with a second<br/>\nreading. It was worse. I called Dee Black with Home School Legal Defense<br/>\nAssociation (HSLDA). He was deeply concerned. I called Ken Wingate, the<br/>\nSouth Carolina attorney for SCAIHS, and he echoed the concerns of HSLDA.<br/>\nOthers that I contacted voiced similar concern-including Lee Safley,<br/>\npresident of the South Carolina Home Educators Association (SCHEA).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Text of House Bill 3364<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bill is short, and you should read it in its entirety.<br/>\n<br/>\nA BILL<br/>\nTO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY ADDING SECTION<br/>\n59-39-155 SO AS TO PROVIDE THAT IF ANY STATE LICENSING, APPOINTMENT,<br/>\nELECTION, ADMISSION, EMPLOYMENT, OR OTHER PROCESS REQUIRES THE APPLICANT TO<br/>\nPOSSESS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR ITS EQUIVALENT, NO SUCH DIPLOMA OR<br/>\nCERTIFICATE SHALL BE ACCEPTABLE FOR PURPOSES OF THAT PROCESS UNLESS THE<br/>\nSTATE BOARD OF EDUCATION CERTIFIES THAT THE STANDARDS OF THE INSTITUTION<br/>\nGRANTING THE DIPLOMA OR CERTIFICATE OR THE STANDARDS OF ANY TESTING USED TO<br/>\nGRANT THE DIPLOMA OR CERTIFICATE ARE AT LEAST COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF THE<br/>\nSTATE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36883,"nextTopicId":36978}}
