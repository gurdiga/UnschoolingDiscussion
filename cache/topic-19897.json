We live smack<br/>\ndab in heavy hobo country.  They are not webspinners,<br/>\nbut nomads, hence the name.  They are also<br/>\nopportunistic hunters, and very agressive.  I have<br/>\nseen them chase my kids, or my nieces, clear across a<br/>\nroom at top speed until the kids hopped onto a piece<br/>\nof furniture or the hobo got squished by an adult,<br/>\nwhichever came first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHobo&#39;s are LARGE, some of the largest spiders I have<br/>\never seen (barring tarantulas that is) and I have<br/>\nsquished ones as big around as a fifty cent piece<br/>\n(from leg tip tp leg tip.)  That is not all leg<br/>\neither, but mostly heavy body.  A plus side to that<br/>\nthough, is that their bodies are so heavy that they do<br/>\nnot climb well, and you will most often find them on<br/>\nthe floor or on a lower part of a wall.  I am not<br/>\nfriendly to spiders roaming my house, particularly<br/>\naggressive, poisonous ones.  So hobos do not get a<br/>\nchance to find another home if I happen upon them in<br/>\nmy house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned something useful though.  The best<br/>\ndeterrent to hobos is other spiders.  I think they eat<br/>\nthe hobos while they are still little, as well as<br/>\ndirve them out of their hunting areas.  The first year<br/>\nwe had this house was our worst hobo year EVER.  The<br/>\nprevious owners had sprayed for bugs in the yard every<br/>\nyear.  The second year we did not spray and there were<br/>\nnoticably less hobos around.  The third year we saw<br/>\nmaybe 2 dozen in the house throughout the summer and<br/>\nfall, and last year that was halved.  I don&#39;t think we<br/>\nwill be around long enough this year before we sell<br/>\nthe house to get a good idea of how many we do or do<br/>\nnot have, since we are selling the house.  But this<br/>\nmethod of hobo control has to be practiced by someone<br/>\ncomfortable with plenty of harmless spiders about in<br/>\nthe yard and garden, and periodic cobweb cleanings on<br/>\nthe outside of the house.  Spiders love this desert<br/>\nclimate.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
