It&#39;s still parked in the <br/>\norchard at my cousin Nada&#39;s house, being a little house.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my dad bought it, and converted it to a camper.  This was in the early <br/>\n60&#39;s.  Time passed.  The late 60&#39;s came and suddenly my dad&#39;s hunting bus was <br/>\ntwo degrees from being groovy and that was NOT okay with him, not one bit.  <br/>\nHe was mortified that what he had worked so hard on was now considered a <br/>\nhippie thing.  (We kids were not mortified, of course. &lt;g&gt;  But we didn&#39;t <br/>\npaint it orange and flowery, although we sure asked him if we could!)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad did his own upholstery (cushions with zippers and piping) for the bed <br/>\nthat converted to a dining table with bench seats.  I hadn&#39;t known he could <br/>\nsew until he did that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever thought of that bus AND the one I bought <br/>\nin the late 1970&#39;s at the same time before.
