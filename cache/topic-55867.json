I&#39;m sure that gets frustrating to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read all the posts in the digests so far, and you&#39;ve gotten lots of<br/>\ngood suggestions.  I know that you&#39;ve made major changes with your family in<br/>\nthe last month or so, and as I recall, that happened as a take the kids out<br/>\nto breakfast family meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like perhaps what you need is another family meeting to talk about<br/>\nhow things are going and discuss the respect for each other you find<br/>\nlacking.  Talk about your feeling of chaos, the breaking of things, and so<br/>\non.  Use those great &quot;I statements&quot; and tell them how you feel.  Have them<br/>\ntell you how they feel, and how you can help each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have boundries.  Some of them are personal boundries, such as I cannot<br/>\nstand being tickled.  Other boundries here are family-size boundries.  We<br/>\ndon&#39;t climb on the sofa.  The sofa is new, it&#39;s the first piece of nice<br/>\nlivingroom furniture we&#39;ve ever had.  My son understands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think boundries are wrong, they just need to not be arbitrary.  To<br/>\nme, that means that the boundries don&#39;t change based on time of day or<br/>\nbehaviour of child.  As far as your stuff getting broken, why is it out<br/>\nwhere it can be broken?  One of our boundries is that my son is welcome in<br/>\nmy studio if I&#39;m in there, but not if I&#39;m not.  I have major investments of<br/>\nmusical instruments in there.  The same goes with our bedrooms.  Everybodys.<br/>\nI don&#39;t go in Tim&#39;s room without him, and he respects my room the same way.<br/>\nIt gives me a space to put things I don&#39;t want moved, broken, etc.  With a<br/>\nnumber of children, I think perhaps that&#39;s multiplied.  It&#39;s certainly fair<br/>\nfor someone (you or anyone else) to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s mine and I<br/>\nwould like you to not play with it&quot;.  Yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 year old is suffering from similar forgetfulness as your daughter.  I&#39;m<br/>\nstarting to think that it&#39;s not that he forgets what I&#39;ve asked, but that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t think about that before he starts something that looks fun.  When<br/>\nconfronted, he remembers, of course, but he wasn&#39;t thinking ahead, so he<br/>\nforgot to remember, if that makes sense.  I think it&#39;s an age thing.  It<br/>\nseems to help if I don&#39;t lose my cool, but merely tell him that I really do<br/>\nneed him to remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you can</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55727,"nextTopicId":55955}}
