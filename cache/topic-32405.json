Make it your &quot;job&quot; to have a great <br/>\ntime together within your financial ability - I mean, YOU be aware of <br/>\nfree and low-cost opportunities, trades you can make with other <br/>\nhomeschoolers, etc. I traded doing math activities with somebody else&#39;s <br/>\nkids in return for her giving my kids violin lessons, for a while. <br/>\nShe&#39;s a superstar professional violinist who somehow manages to keep up <br/>\nher career while homeschooling her two sons. What a deal -  I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave afforded her as a teacher even when I WAS working!

It means you&#39;re <br/>\ndeciding on your children&#39;s futures for them far too early. Saving for <br/>\nyourselves is a lot better deal - then you can use the money for what <br/>\nyou want, when you want. Maybe they&#39;ll win full scholarships to <br/>\ncollege. Maybe they won&#39;t GO to college.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck into group health insurance through groups you might belong to - <br/>\ncredit unions, for example. Again, make that your job to figure out a <br/>\nway to have health insurance. Maybe a part-time job with fewer hours <br/>\nthat gives you an option to buy into a health insurance program.

Rebecca <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Rebecca,<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you tell us what your reasons are for not perming?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that MY reasons would be the chemicals. After all, the skin soaks <br/>\nin everything it comes in contact with and I&#39;m not so keen about that. We <br/>\ndon&#39;t even use shampoo with Sulpher Laurates (sp) (nitrates) in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, I know some of the health food stores carry vegetable dyes now.. <br/>\nI&#39;ll make a point to find out about perms for you if thats your issue <br/>\nalso.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing my mom used to say about lettting us do whatever with our hair, <br/>\nis that it grows back.. so she didn&#39;t get bent outta shape about her 4 <br/>\ndaughters and their experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is interested in doing it herself, then maybe you can just let her <br/>\nroll it and then she can see what it would look like, sans chemicals?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you can always go and get one of those heads with real hair <br/>\nfrom the beauty store and let her practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its great that she has such a focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People take different roads seeking <br/>\nfulfillment and happiness. Just <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re not on your road <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve gotten lost.&quot;<br/>\n             -H.
