I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-173287123\">I am so relieved. My house is upside down from getting our portfolio together <br/>\nfor review, and from canning tomato sauce for the first time, but WHO CARES! <br/>\nI spent the morning outside in the cool breeze sitting with my girl <br/>\ndiscussing plans for the year. She still wants to go to fifth grade, but next <br/>\nyear, as an 11yo(she started K after just turning 5, was the youngest in her <br/>\nclass and has always been behind in emotional maturity). I saw this on a <br/>\nmessage board, and wanted to share it. I am so thankful and happy I do not <br/>\nrepresent the parent in this narrative, although that is how my precious dd <br/>\ngot her start in her education:<br/>\n<br/>\nDear World:<br/>\n<br/>\nI bequeath to you today one little girl...in a crispy dress..with two blue <br/>\neyes...and a happy laugh that ripples all day long..and a flash of light <br/>\nblonde hair that bounces in the sunlight when she runs. I trust you&#39;ll treat <br/>\nher well.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s slipping out of the backyard of my heart this morning...and skipping <br/>\noff down the street to her first day of school. And never again will she be <br/>\ncompletely mine. Prim and proud she&#39;ll wave her young and independent hand <br/>\nthis morning and say &quot;Good Bye&quot;...and walk with little lady steps to the <br/>\nschoolhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she&#39;ll learn to stand in line...and wait by the alphabet for her name to <br/>\nbe called. She&#39;ll learn to tune her ears to the sounds of school-bells...and <br/>\ndeadlines...and she&#39;ll learn to giggle...and gossip...and look at the ceiling <br/>\nin a disinterested way when the little boy across the aisle sticks out his <br/>\ntongue at her. And now she&#39;ll learn to be jealous. And now she&#39;ll learn how <br/>\nit is to feel hurt inside. And now she&#39;ll learn how not to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo longer will she have time to sit on the front porch steps on a summer day <br/>\nand watch an ant scurry across the crack in a sidewalk. Nor will she have <br/>\ntime to pop out of bed with the dawn to kiss lilac blossoms in the morning <br/>\ndew. No, now she&#39;ll worry about important things. Like grades...and which <br/>\ndress to wear...and who&#39;s best friend is whose. And the magic of books and <br/>\nlearning will replace the magic of her blocks and dolls. And now she&#39;ll find<br/>\nnew heroes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor five full years now I&#39;ve been her sage and Santa Claus and pal and <br/>\nplaymate and father and friend. Now she&#39;ll learn to share her worship with <br/>\nher teachers...which is only right. But, no longer will I be the smartest man <br/>\nin the whole world. Today when that school bell rings for the first <br/>\ntime...she&#39;ll learn what it means to be a member of a group. With all it&#39;s <br/>\nprivileges. And it&#39;s disadvantages too.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll learn in time that proper young ladies do not laugh out loud. Or kiss <br/>\ndogs. Or keep frogs in pickle jars in bedrooms. Or even watch ants scurry <br/>\nacross cracks in the summer sidewalk.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday she&#39;ll learn for the first time that all who smile at her are not her <br/>\nfriends. And I&#39;ll stand on the front porch and watch her start out on the <br/>\nlong, lonely journey to become a woman.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, World. I bequeath to you today one little girl...in a crispy dress...with <br/>\ntwo blue eyes and a happy laugh that ripples all day long...and a flash of <br/>\nlight blonde hair that bounces in the sunlight when she runs. I trust you&#39;ll <br/>\ntreat her well.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nSAHM to<br/>\nMegan Elizabeth 8/8/92 8lbs 8oz<br/>\nAshlyn Olivia 7/25/99 9lbs 8oz<br/>\n Christian James 6/09/01 9lbs 5oz<br/>\n*NEW* &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/megamom08/hometour.html&quot;\">http://www.geocities.com/megamom08/hometour.html&quot;</a>&gt;Ang&#39;s Virtual Home Tour&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;\">http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;</a>&gt;Meet MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt;   <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;</a>&gt;Christian&#39;s Birth Story&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Girls page&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n|w|w|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42155,"nextTopicId":42124}}
