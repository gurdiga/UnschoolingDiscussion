If you feed<br/>\nthem a lot of tomato scraps (like after canning  tomatoes) the their shells<br/>\nare rubbery.  Different things can make  them harder or more brittle.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s true.  Our chickens have always been able to roam where ever  (we <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any close neighbors) so the bulk of their food is probably what a  wild <br/>\nbird would eat.  About once every 13 or 15 years (something like that)  here <br/>\nin WV there is a mass hatching of Cicada&#39;s (everyone calls them  locusts)...I <br/>\nmean gazillions of them...everywhere you step...they even get in  your hair.  <br/>\nThat year, we would put food out for the chickens and they  wouldn&#39;t even <br/>\ntouch it.  They were feasting on Cicadas!  It sure  helped keep the number of bugs <br/>\nwe had to deal with much lower.<br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112598,"nextTopicId":112657}}
