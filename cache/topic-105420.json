She might be talking about her brothers and some of our <br/>\nother  unschooled friends as much as about herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s going to England to  visit friends she&#39;s known as long as she can <br/>\nremember, from here, who&#39;ve lived  there for six years. She&#39;ll get to go to France <br/>\nfor a wedding while she&#39;s there,  too. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all very cool, but Keith is in the hospital and Holly is worried  about <br/>\nnot having any spending money while she&#39;s there, and that&#39;s smaller than  my <br/>\nworries about the situation, but... <br/>\n<br/>\nIn conjunction with the news that  this message board will be retired, I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to sell off the tapes I have, and  Thinking Sticks, and I have morning <br/>\nglory seeds I collected from my many vines  last year, too. I&#39;d like to do a <br/>\nselling push so that I&#39;ll have money to  transfer to Holly while she&#39;s there <br/>\nwithout having to trouble Keith for it if  he&#39;s still sick, and it would reassure <br/>\nHolly to know I have a fundraising plan  for her so she&#39;ll have spending money <br/>\nwhile she&#39;s there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two  tapes available, one on Peaceful Parenting and an intro to <br/>\nunschooling, but I&#39;ll  put the details elsewhere for fear of violating policies <br/>\nhere. I&#39;ll put info  here very soon: <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tapes_\">http://sandradodd.com/tapes_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tapes)\">http://sandradodd.com/tapes)</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and HesFes is in SW  England, and is short (I think) for Home Educators&#39; <br/>\nSeaside Festival.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra   <br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n By _Sandra  Dodd (Sandradodd)_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-profile.cgi?action=display_profile&profile=sandradodd-public)\">http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-profile.cgi?action=display_profile&profile=sandradodd-public)</a>  on Friday, <br/>\nApril 15, 2005 - 08:50 pm:  <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tapes_\">http://sandradodd.com/tapes_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tapes)\">http://sandradodd.com/tapes)</a>  <br/>\nThat page is all set and ready to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if anyone uses the  PayPal link and it has any problems with it, <br/>\nplease let me know. And if you did  use that, it should take you to a thank-you <br/>\npage with other details. Please let  me know if that&#39;s not working. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s still in the hospital for at  least three or five more days (maybe <br/>\nmore, depending on what happens with the  next round of tests, which can&#39;t be <br/>\ndone for three or five more days). Luckily,  Holly is playing Halo II online and <br/>\nbeing merrily distracted. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd our  clothes dryer broke. I have contracted to buy a used one. I&#39;m not <br/>\njust whining  now. It&#39;s an appeal for sympathy (although honestly deserved <br/>\nsympathy!! ) and  further sales tallies. <br/>\nSandra  <br/>\n--------------[Update on Keith 4/18:  He might be out of the hospital  today <br/>\nor tomorrow.  He had a CAT scan this morning and things look good  enough to <br/>\nsend him home.  He&#39;s got a tube and a drain (gross to describe,  so I won&#39;t) <br/>\nand is weak and doesn&#39;t eat much, but he might as well lie around  and watch <br/>\ngood movies at home as lie around and watch bad cable in the  hospital.  At least <br/>\nhere we won&#39;t keep waking him up to ask if he&#39;s  asleep.   He&#39;s on short-term <br/>\ndisability and will be out of work for a  while.]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105414,"nextTopicId":105443}}
