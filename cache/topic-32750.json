I<br/>\nhave been homeschooling for a few years now.  I have a 7 year old and <br/>\nan<br/>\nalmost 1 year old.    I made a website for<br/>\nthe homeschoolers here and for all homeschoolers.  It has a classified<br/>\nsection too, that all homeschoolers can use for free to sell your <br/>\nhomeschool<br/>\nitems or other items. I also have a calendar for field trips/chats to <br/>\nbe added too,<br/>\nthat anyone can use.   I also have a lot of links to sites for <br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\nHave not had a lot of traffic yet so hope that you all will take a <br/>\nlook at<br/>\nit and bookmark it. If you like it please tell other homeschool <br/>\nfriends about it too.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lewiscountyhomeschool.com\">http://www.lewiscountyhomeschool.com</a> Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32701,"nextTopicId":32753}}
