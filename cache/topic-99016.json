We had TONS of fun, but exhausting fun, and we&#39;re glad <br/>\nto be home.<br/>\nYesterday when we got home I explored the changes in the yard, watered some <br/>\nstuff, and went shopping with Keith so we could tell stories.  I fell asleep <br/>\nabout 8:00 and woke up at 3:15 with a sore throat, but I DON&#39;T CARE!  I&#39;m <br/>\nhome.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is playing with her rats and Marty is playing a video game in his room. <br/>\n They&#39;re up early from being up early for a week on Eastern time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for the rest of the day I guess I&#39;ll be answering week-old (and <br/>\nincreasingly more recent) posts, until I quit to take Marty clothes shopping or to take <br/>\nHolly to a D&D game she wants <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I think the crafts are more compelling if they are grown-up, <br/>\nauthentic things. Making a banner is more interesting if you have a <br/>\nreal herald there showing you what some of the symbols mean, <br/>\naccurate color combinations and layouts and such.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking as an unschooler, as a longtime SCA member, and as a Mistress of the <br/>\nLaurel (which will mean nothing to most of this list, which is fine), I think <br/>\npeople shouldn&#39;t have to wait for a real herlad to show them about layouts <br/>\nand color combinations, because there are some GREAT heraldry books and webpages <br/>\nout there.   Preparations for events like costume making, banners, dishes, <br/>\nlearning to weave, should ideally all take place away from events and so the <br/>\nlearning that happens should happen in preparation for going to an event all <br/>\ndoodied up in period outfits.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how I see it as the most unschooling-glorious activity it can be.   <br/>\nAnd for people who are already long &quot;out of school&quot; and have no children, for <br/>\nthem too the learning should be at home, with friends or alone, at guild <br/>\nmeetings MAYBE (our group resisted &quot;guild&quot; culture) but for fun.  And if it&#39;s not <br/>\nfun, it shouldn&#39;t be done.   And when someone really cares about medieval or <br/>\nRenaissance life, all that learning is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99015,"nextTopicId":98993}}
