The thing I like about it is that you are never <br/>\nbehind, you just start where you are. I have three kids that don&#39;t really <br/>\n&quot;clean&quot; yet. If they do try to clean their rooms it is never how *I* would <br/>\ndo it and I have found that *that* is OK. I do not obsess over their rooms <br/>\nor over my house. I do my *zones* so that it never gets totally out of <br/>\ncontrol (like not being able to see yourself though the toothpaste splatters <br/>\non your bathroom mirror). The 27 fling bogie worked for me for a few months <br/>\n(I had a lot of junk I did not really like)and after that I just quit doing <br/>\nthat part. Like FlyLady says you can delete the e-mails at will. You don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to do them if they do not fit into your lifestyle. There is no whining <br/>\nabout that, just delete and do what is right for you. It is working for me <br/>\nbecause I really needed routines, and needed to know when it was time to <br/>\nwash my dishes because for some reason I was not built with that internal <br/>\nclock that let me know until it was to late...lol (until I had no clean <br/>\ndishes and no place to stack anymore if I did have them)! Anyway, FlyLady <br/>\nhas worked for me and my family only because I have adapted her ideas into <br/>\n*our* lives. I do not live to do housework, but my house (now) is <br/>\npresentable if someone just happens to knock on the door, and I like that <br/>\nfeeling!<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: Rachel Ann Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> To: <br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> Subject: RE: Re [Unschooling-dotcom] <br/>\n&gt;Intro Date: Wed, 05 Mar 2003 08:43:24 -0500 (Eastern Standard Time)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also hated fly-lady.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;First her stance, no bitching. Well, if you couldn&#39;t bitch about problems <br/>\n&gt;with her system that meant her system went unchallenged. Either it works or <br/>\n&gt;you didn&#39;t work, one or the other. Second, it was all up to whoever was <br/>\n&gt;reading the emails; mostly women. The system was suppose to make the family <br/>\n&gt;members help. HA! I went on this kick for awhile, cleaning so that when I <br/>\n&gt;did the living room I was washing the floors with wood soap (Wood floors) <br/>\n&gt;each week....by hand, it was so clean, and no one really helped all that <br/>\n&gt;often.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Half my problem is not my stuff but others. She leaves you two choices; <br/>\n&gt;leave it or toss it, if it is the kids. Well, I&#39;m not tossing the <br/>\n&gt;children&#39;s stuff, or dh&#39;s and my own stuff, basically if I keep it I want <br/>\n&gt;it. The boogies (27 boogie) meant I was either tossing things I may have <br/>\n&gt;wanted or I was tossing bit of paper etc. But the house is not going to <br/>\n&gt;look clean if my dh doesn&#39;t do the recycle, doesn&#39;t want me to do it (he <br/>\n&gt;has a particular way) and the recycle keeps flowing out of it&#39;s area and <br/>\n&gt;into the rest of the house. The house isn&#39;t going to stay clean if five <br/>\n&gt;minutes after I&#39;ve put everything away, the kids take out their toys and <br/>\n&gt;spread them on the ground.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;After awhile all my attention was focused on trying to keep the house clean <br/>\n&gt;and i was becoming bitter and angry. I ended up working all the time to <br/>\n&gt;keep it clean, feeling like a dishrag, and hating the house, the family <br/>\n&gt;etc. etc. And then I would get sick, or have some other obligation that <br/>\n&gt;kept me from doing my routines; the house would just collapse and become a <br/>\n&gt;mess, and no one was pitching in. It just didn&#39;t work for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Maybe we have too many people with too much stuff for the size of the <br/>\n&gt;house, but FlyLady just left me angry, not happy, and made me feel like a <br/>\n&gt;person who is always on a diet, where they can think of nothing but food.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;be well, Rachel Ann<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-------Original Message-------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> Date: Wednesday, March 05, 2003 <br/>\n&gt;07:43:53 To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> Subject: RE: Re <br/>\n&gt;[Unschooling-dotcom] Intro<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My flylady rant: I was subscribed to flylady from last May until just after <br/>\n&gt;Christmas. The house was much cleaner but I was also *so* much more <br/>\n&gt;conscious of it. I mean, all day long, reading message after message about <br/>\n&gt;clutter and how bad it is. It made me feel like all of our stuff was <br/>\n&gt;clutter. I was busy &quot;fling boogie&quot;ing things left and right because, you <br/>\n&gt;know, &quot;you can&#39;t organize clutter&quot;. Rather than make me more relaxed, it <br/>\n&gt;made me more anxious. After all, if 150,000 other women now have spotless <br/>\n&gt;homes thanks to the system, why is mine uncontrollable? It made me think of <br/>\n&gt;my children&#39;s belongings as clutter. After a series of flylady messages <br/>\n&gt;about throwing away kid&#39;s stuff because they don&#39;t need that much anyway <br/>\n&gt;and etc, I pulled out a trash bag and decided to get rid of some stuff. My <br/>\n&gt;son was absolutely horrified, and I came to my senses and realized it&#39;s not <br/>\n&gt;my decision to make. And it&#39;s not helpful to constantly get emails telling <br/>\n&gt;me that the kids&#39; stuff all over the place is a bad thing. Also, I was in a <br/>\n&gt;lot more pain when I was doing flylady. I injured my back three years ago <br/>\n&gt;and it usually doesn&#39;t hurt. But setting a timer and cleaning everything I <br/>\n&gt;can for 15 minutes straight made me want to cry. She says &quot;you can do <br/>\n&gt;anything for 15 minutes&quot; but honestly it was causing a lot of back pain to <br/>\n&gt;clean for 15 straight minutes. Maybe I sound lazy, admitting I can&#39;t clean <br/>\n&gt;house for 15 minutes at a time. But it&#39;s true and I&#39;d always be lying on <br/>\n&gt;ice afterwards, or I&#39;d get the living room picked up and then my husband <br/>\n&gt;would vacuum for me while I sat down and took aspirin. So yes, my home is <br/>\n&gt;much messier since I unsubscribed, but I&#39;m much more at peace about it <br/>\n&gt;without her nagging me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorcha<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
