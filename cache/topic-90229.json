Her fav is softball.  I find myself getting overly involved <br/>\nand sometimes embarrassed by my own words that some how just pop out <br/>\nof my mouth before my brain before my brain gets a chance to capture <br/>\nthem and edit.  I could not tolerate sitting in the car (nor did dd <br/>\nlike it) so I bring a book.  When I feel worked up, I read.  It has <br/>\nworked every time.  Bring my BP back down to normal in no time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda worry about the mom who&#39;s son won&#39;t let her forget that she <br/>\nmissed two games in all those years.  And you missed because you were <br/>\nin childbirth or shortly after?  I hope he is tongue in cheek teasing <br/>\nhis mom.  Please.  Will he be sensitive to a wife during and after <br/>\nlabor if he isn&#39;t to his own mom?  He WAS teasing, right?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90204,"nextTopicId":90235}}
