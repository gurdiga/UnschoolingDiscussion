You always \n  unschooled, right?<br><br>Well... our oldest son took a state correspondence \n  course program for <br>the first grade when we lived in Alaska. It only took \n  us about a <br>month of reading the textbooks and filling out the workbooks to \n  <br>figure out that it was mostly busywork, that he either already knew \n  <br>all that stuff or could pick it up quicker with short explanations \n  <br>than via their texts. So we skipped most of the textbooks and just <br>did \n  the stuff he found interesting. He passed at the end of the year <br>with a \n  special commendation from the overseeing teacher for a paper <br>mache globe \n  he built on his own. Of course almost anyone can pass <br>first grade \n  &lt;g&gt; but it showed us that schooling, even long-distance <br>schooling, \n  was mostly about keeping kids busy.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Did you have discussions \n  with your children while they were growing <br>&gt;up about the unschooling \n  philosophy and compare it to other options?<br><br>We publish Home Education \n  Magazine, and when our kids were young we <br>travelled to conferences all \n  over the country, where, in addition to <br>helping us do workshops and answer \n  peoples&#39; questions, and sitting in <br>on the other workshops and speeches, \n  our kids compared notes with <br>lots of other kids, so they grew up knowing \n  about all the various <br>ways people homeschool - everything from our very \n  laid back approach <br>to the school-at-home other end of the \n  spectrum.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Has any of them ever said they wish they&#39;d been \n  &quot;pushed&quot; into <br>&gt;learning anything?<br><br>Yes. Our oldest son, John, \n  spent about six months living with his <br>biological dad and that dad&#39;s new \n  wife, who knew nothing about <br>homeschooling and was convinced that it was \n  all just a very bad idea. <br>John came home one day and confronted us with \n  questions about why we <br>hadn&#39;t sent him to school so he could be like \n  &quot;normal&quot; kids... or at <br>least forced him to do schoolwork and take tests \n  and all that. We <br>recognized the source of the problem and the reasons for \n  John&#39;s <br>questions, so we patiently explained all the reasons we believed in \n  <br>this different way of learning, why we had decided that school was an \n  <br>unhealthy place for kids, basically nothing new, but just reinforcing \n  <br>what we&#39;d always done. And we discussed it all in front of the <br>younger \n  kids, because we knew they were interested in what had <br>happened, and why \n  John was upset, and we wanted them to be able to <br>discuss it with him, too. \n  (Interesting aside: John&#39;s younger brother <br>Jim wasn&#39;t interested in living \n  with the bioDad and the new wife - he <br>thought the new wife was too \n  controlling and flaky. Apparently my <br>ex-dh decided so too, as they split \n  after less than a year.)<br><br>Right now our youngest son, 15, has been \n  insisting on more and more <br>structured learning opportunities, books on \n  certain subjects, <br>computer programs, etc., because he&#39;s interested in the \n  idea of going <br>to college. He&#39;s spent some time at various colleges in \n  Seattle where <br>his cousins and several of our kids&#39; friends are now, and \n  likes the <br>atmosphere, the ambiance... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; What age \n  do you think a child has to be to be able to really think <br>&gt;about these \n  things?<br><br>I think that totally depends on the child. All our kids have \n  <br>developed on very different schedules.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Did you ever \n  &quot;encourage&quot; certain learning?<br><br>All the time! From publishing this \n  magazine for so long we receive <br>incredible amounts of curriculum \n  materials, computer programs, all <br>the newest, best stuff. And we always \n  make sure the kids know it&#39;s <br>available to them if they&#39;re interested. They \n  rarely are. They see <br>all those learning resources (some of which I think \n  are quite <br>wonderful) as just ways to trick kids into learning, to make \n  parents <br>happy, or something. Their BS detectors are pretty refined. \n  &lt;g&gt;<br><br>So I content myself with buying - or more often these days, \n  helping <br>them figure out how to buy - what they *are* interested in, which \n  <br>translates to tons of books and magazines on their favorite topics, \n  <br>and tools and materials for all kinds of endeavors from furniture \n  <br>building to horse training to car repair to gardening to cooking. \n  <br>They&#39;re all hands-on learners - they get interested in something, <br>like \n  making pottery or stained glass windows, and just dive in and <br>start doing \n  it, learning as they go. This spring they&#39;ve all been <br>interested in \n  sailing, so the house is full of books and magazines on <br>sailing, we&#39;ve \n  been watching movies about sailing, they&#39;re lining up <br>adventures this \n  summer with all our friends who own sailboats, and <br>studying how much a \n  small one would cost! Immersion learning.<br><br>We&#39;ve always travelled a lot \n  - we just spent 2 weeks in California <br>and Oregon, and we go to Alaska at \n  least 2 or 3 times a year - and <br>travelling is always an excellent way to \n  learn, especially when <br>you&#39;re able to take your time and enjoy the special \n  places along the <br>way. And of course they also like computer and video \n  games, movies, <br>music... all the usual stuff.<br><br>&gt;I have an (almost) \n  8-year-old son and I still worry about choosing <br>&gt;the unshooling \n  philosophy :o) for him as opposed to his being able <br>&gt;to decide for \n  himself... Did you ever worry about what they might <br>&gt;want &quot;to be when \n  they grow up&quot; and worry if the unshooling <br>&gt;philosophy would prepare \n  them well-enough?<br><br>Nope. I never really questioned our decision to let \n  our kids follow <br>their bliss and learn from living an interesting life - \n  but then I <br>already knew how well it had worked for me and my brothers and \n  <br>sisters.<br><br>&gt;I know that supposedly children will what they need \n  when they need <br>&gt;it but did you ever worry? etc., etc., etc.! As you can \n  see, I&#39;m in <br>&gt;worry mode right now...<br><br>Well... I think that&#39;s \n  good. Parents are supposed to worry about <br>what&#39;s best for their children, \n  to be concerned about their futures, <br>whether or not they&#39;re doing the \n  right thing, or enough of the right <br>thing... And now, please don&#39;t take \n  this wrong, but I&#39;m potentially <br>going to get myself in hot water with this \n  list... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>I&#39;m not convinced that the kind of totally laid-back, \n  no textbooks, <br>no expectations approach we took with our kids is right for \n  everyone. <br>In fact, we don&#39;t even advise it as anything to emulate. For \n  those <br>who find it working, great - we do think it&#39;s an excellent way to \n  <br>live with your kids, to prepare them for all the various <br>peculiarities \n  of life. But one needs to come to that kind of <br>understanding about \n  learning on their own, not because someone - no <br>matter how respected they \n  may be - says it&#39;s something they should <br>do. It&#39;s not something you can \n  try this week, decide it&#39;s not <br>working, and go back to a curriculum next \n  week saying it didn&#39;t work. <br>It&#39;s not an approach to learning so much as a \n  way of life, a belief <br>and a trust and a certain surety about the outcome. \n  Not that one is <br>ever finished learning... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>But I do think \n  it takes a certain kind of headset. Mark and I are <br>both very relaxed and \n  mellow people. We tend not to worry about <br>things, feeling that even when \n  things aren&#39;t going the way we think <br>they should, we can learn and grow \n  from the experience and figure out <br>what needs to be done differently to \n  make them go the way we think <br>they should. Sometimes even that doesn&#39;t \n  work out, and then we need <br>to totally rethink everything... and more often \n  than not we end up <br>doing something completely different than what we&#39;d \n  started out <br>doing. That&#39;s just not a comfortable way for some people to \n  function. <br>We&#39;ve learned that many people need certainty, rules, \n  regulations, <br>proven solutions, and all the rest. And that&#39;s okay for them, \n  but it <br>might make unschooling difficult. At least I can&#39;t imagine how the \n  <br>kind of radical unschooling we&#39;ve embraced would work without a \n  <br>serious amount of flexibility involved.<br><br>Hope this \n  helps,<br>Helen<br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message \n  boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: \n  <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n  message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n  Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n  use of Yahoo!

You always unschooled, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well... our oldest son took a state correspondence course program for <br/>\nthe first grade when we lived in Alaska. It only took us about a <br/>\nmonth of reading the textbooks and filling out the workbooks to <br/>\nfigure out that it was mostly busywork, that he either already knew <br/>\nall that stuff or could pick it up quicker with short explanations <br/>\nthan via their texts. So we skipped most of the textbooks and just <br/>\ndid the stuff he found interesting. He passed at the end of the year <br/>\nwith a special commendation from the overseeing teacher for a paper <br/>\nmache globe he built on his own. Of course almost anyone can pass <br/>\nfirst grade &lt;g&gt; but it showed us that schooling, even long-distance <br/>\nschooling, was mostly about keeping kids busy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Did you have discussions with your children while they were growing <br/>\n&gt;up about the unschooling philosophy and compare it to other options?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We publish Home Education Magazine, and when our kids were young we <br/>\ntravelled to conferences all over the country, where, in addition to <br/>\nhelping us do workshops and answer peoples&#39; questions, and sitting in <br/>\non the other workshops and speeches, our kids compared notes with <br/>\nlots of other kids, so they grew up knowing about all the various <br/>\nways people homeschool - everything from our very laid back approach <br/>\nto the school-at-home other end of the spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Has any of them ever said they wish they&#39;d been &quot;pushed&quot; into <br/>\n&gt;learning anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. Our oldest son, John, spent about six months living with his <br/>\nbiological dad and that dad&#39;s new wife, who knew nothing about <br/>\nhomeschooling and was convinced that it was all just a very bad idea. <br/>\nJohn came home one day and confronted us with questions about why we <br/>\nhadn&#39;t sent him to school so he could be like &quot;normal&quot; kids... or at <br/>\nleast forced him to do schoolwork and take tests and all that. We <br/>\nrecognized the source of the problem and the reasons for John&#39;s <br/>\nquestions, so we patiently explained all the reasons we believed in <br/>\nthis different way of learning, why we had decided that school was an <br/>\nunhealthy place for kids, basically nothing new, but just reinforcing <br/>\nwhat we&#39;d always done. And we discussed it all in front of the <br/>\nyounger kids, because we knew they were interested in what had <br/>\nhappened, and why John was upset, and we wanted them to be able to <br/>\ndiscuss it with him, too. (Interesting aside: John&#39;s younger brother <br/>\nJim wasn&#39;t interested in living with the bioDad and the new wife - he <br/>\nthought the new wife was too controlling and flaky. Apparently my <br/>\nex-dh decided so too, as they split after less than a year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now our youngest son, 15, has been insisting on more and more <br/>\nstructured learning opportunities, books on certain subjects, <br/>\ncomputer programs, etc., because he&#39;s interested in the idea of going <br/>\nto college. He&#39;s spent some time at various colleges in Seattle where <br/>\nhis cousins and several of our kids&#39; friends are now, and likes the <br/>\natmosphere, the ambiance... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  What age do you think a child has to be to be able to really think <br/>\n&gt;about these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think that totally depends on the child. All our kids have <br/>\ndeveloped on very different schedules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Did you ever &quot;encourage&quot; certain learning?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All the time! From publishing this magazine for so long we receive <br/>\nincredible amounts of curriculum materials, computer programs, all <br/>\nthe newest, best stuff. And we always make sure the kids know it&#39;s <br/>\navailable to them if they&#39;re interested. They rarely are. They see <br/>\nall those learning resources (some of which I think are quite <br/>\nwonderful) as just ways to trick kids into learning, to make parents <br/>\nhappy, or something. Their BS detectors are pretty refined. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I content myself with buying - or more often these days, helping <br/>\nthem figure out how to buy - what they *are* interested in, which <br/>\ntranslates to tons of books and magazines on their favorite topics, <br/>\nand tools and materials for all kinds of endeavors from furniture <br/>\nbuilding to horse training to car repair to gardening to cooking. <br/>\nThey&#39;re all hands-on learners - they get interested in something, <br/>\nlike making pottery or stained glass windows, and just dive in and <br/>\nstart doing it, learning as they go. This spring they&#39;ve all been <br/>\ninterested in sailing, so the house is full of books and magazines on <br/>\nsailing, we&#39;ve been watching movies about sailing, they&#39;re lining up <br/>\nadventures this summer with all our friends who own sailboats, and <br/>\nstudying how much a small one would cost! Immersion learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always travelled a lot - we just spent 2 weeks in California <br/>\nand Oregon, and we go to Alaska at least 2 or 3 times a year - and <br/>\ntravelling is always an excellent way to learn, especially when <br/>\nyou&#39;re able to take your time and enjoy the special places along the <br/>\nway. And of course they also like computer and video games, movies, <br/>\nmusic... all the usual stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have an (almost) 8-year-old son and I still worry about choosing <br/>\n&gt;the unshooling philosophy :o) for him as opposed to his being able <br/>\n&gt;to decide for himself... Did you ever worry about what they might <br/>\n&gt;want &quot;to be when they grow up&quot; and worry if the unshooling <br/>\n&gt;philosophy would prepare them well-enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope. I never really questioned our decision to let our kids follow <br/>\ntheir bliss and learn from living an interesting life - but then I <br/>\nalready knew how well it had worked for me and my brothers and <br/>\nsisters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I know that supposedly children will what they need when they need <br/>\n&gt;it but did you ever worry? etc., etc., etc.! As you can see, I&#39;m in <br/>\n&gt;worry mode right now...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well... I think that&#39;s good. Parents are supposed to worry about <br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for their children, to be concerned about their futures, <br/>\nwhether or not they&#39;re doing the right thing, or enough of the right <br/>\nthing... And now, please don&#39;t take this wrong, but I&#39;m potentially <br/>\ngoing to get myself in hot water with this list... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not convinced that the kind of totally laid-back, no textbooks, <br/>\nno expectations approach we took with our kids is right for everyone. <br/>\nIn fact, we don&#39;t even advise it as anything to emulate. For those <br/>\nwho find it working, great - we do think it&#39;s an excellent way to <br/>\nlive with your kids, to prepare them for all the various <br/>\npeculiarities of life. But one needs to come to that kind of <br/>\nunderstanding about learning on their own, not because someone - no <br/>\nmatter how respected they may be - says it&#39;s something they should <br/>\ndo. It&#39;s not something you can try this week, decide it&#39;s not <br/>\nworking, and go back to a curriculum next week saying it didn&#39;t work. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not an approach to learning so much as a way of life, a belief <br/>\nand a trust and a certain surety about the outcome. Not that one is <br/>\never finished learning... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do think it takes a certain kind of headset. Mark and I are <br/>\nboth very relaxed and mellow people. We tend not to worry about <br/>\nthings, feeling that even when things aren&#39;t going the way we think <br/>\nthey should, we can learn and grow from the experience and figure out <br/>\nwhat needs to be done differently to make them go the way we think <br/>\nthey should. Sometimes even that doesn&#39;t work out, and then we need <br/>\nto totally rethink everything... and more often than not we end up <br/>\ndoing something completely different than what we&#39;d started out <br/>\ndoing. That&#39;s just not a comfortable way for some people to function. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve learned that many people need certainty, rules, regulations, <br/>\nproven solutions, and all the rest. And that&#39;s okay for them, but it <br/>\nmight make unschooling difficult. At least I can&#39;t imagine how the <br/>\nkind of radical unschooling we&#39;ve embraced would work without a <br/>\nserious amount of flexibility involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps,<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"OmTdiHkvSdlUO2-HzgrJ_NsJNLMHGvUkHUum04ffI9b9YdKGKzAwxKLXHOTEder4kpnNHDbM4Dfp","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re Changing the world","postDate":"986564405","msgId":18176,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRiLjEyYjBmN2E4LjI3ZmYyMTM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18174,"nextInTopic":18223,"prevInTime":18175,"nextInTime":18177,"topicId":18130,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/5/01 9:58:47 PM, HEM-Editor@home-ed-magazine.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-160094639\">In a message dated 4/5/01 9:58:47 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; their favorites were <br/>\nwatched over and over and over again until the tapes practically wore <br/>\nout.
