Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift.<br/>\n     That&#39;s why it&#39;s called the present!<br/>\n<br/>\n* Killing time murders opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Devote each day to the object then in time and every evening will<br/>\nfind something done. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Do not dwell in the past. Do not dream of the future. Concentrate the <br/>\nmind on the present moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Dost thou love life? then do not squander time, for that is the stuff <br/>\nlife is made of. <br/>\n<br/>\n* I wasted time, and now doth time waste me. <br/>\n<br/>\n* If you lose an hour in the morning, you have to hunt for it the rest <br/>\nof the day. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of<br/>\nit. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off        <br/>\ntill to-morrow what you can do to-day. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Lost, yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden <br/>\nhours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered, for<br/>\nthey are gone forever! <br/>\n<br/>\n* Neither will the wave which has passed be called back; nor can the <br/>\nhour which has gone by return.<br/>\n <br/>\n* One always has time enough, if one will apply it well. <br/>\n<br/>\n* The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely <br/>\nto see. <br/>\n<br/>\n* The future comes one day at a time. <br/>\n<br/>\n* The future influences the present just as much as the past. <br/>\n<br/>\n* The Future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty <br/>\nminutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is. <br/>\n<br/>\n* The velocity with which time flies is infinite, as is most apparent<br/>\nto those who look back. <br/>\n<br/>\n* We take no note of time but from its loss. <br/>\n<br/>\n* What a day may bring, a day may take away. <br/>\n<br/>\n* What a folly to dread the thought of throwing away life at once, and <br/>\nyet have no regard of throwing it away by parcels and piecemeal. <br/>\n<br/>\n* When you sit with a nice girl for two hours, you think it&#39;s only a <br/>\nminute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think        <br/>\nit&#39;s two hours. That&#39;s relativity. <br/>\n<br/>\n* You wake up in the morning, and lo! your purse is wonderfully filled <br/>\nwith twenty-four hours of the tissue of the universe of your life. No<br/>\none can take it from you. No one receives either more or less than you<br/>\nreceive. Waste your infinitely precious commodity as much as you will,<br/>\nand the supply will never be withheld from you. Moreover, you cannot<br/>\ndraw on the future. Impossible to get into debt. You can only waste the<br/>\npassing moment. You cannot waste tomorrow. It is kept for you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4973,"nextTopicId":4796}}
