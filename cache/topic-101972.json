It&#39;s just one piece of advice, and everyone else here has the opportunity to give their own, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s contrived, manipulative or disrespectful, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not antithetical to unschooling as it works at my house and at some others.<br/>\n<br/>\n======<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my most recent descriptions of what I do--not a bit of it is <br/>\ndisrespecting my children, imo or theirs. Granted, my children are <br/>\nyoung, but I&#39;ve been unschooling, as in officially declared, for three <br/>\nyears now--not veteran, but not newbie either.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing, for me, is all about having cool and interesting things in the<br/>\nhouse. If I see something I think is cool, I pick it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that &quot;strewing&quot; is a way of creating a rich environment from<br/>\nwhich children can freely pick and choose. It is *not* a way of slyly<br/>\nconstructing a curriculum that includes all the requisite subjects, like<br/>\nmath, science, literature, history, etc. Does that difference make<br/>\nsense? Some folks hear the word &quot;strew&quot; and think, &quot;oh, okay, so I can<br/>\nstrew that science book or math book or classic.&quot;  That, in my mind, is<br/>\nnot what strewing is about; that&#39;s replacing a canned curriculum with a<br/>\nmanipulative one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things I strew could be considered &quot;schooly,&quot; but mostly they&#39;re<br/>\njust interesting. I can remember quite clearly in elementary school,<br/>\nback when we were in the same classroom all day with the same people:<br/>\nthere was one girl identified as &quot;gifted&quot; before the &quot;gifted and<br/>\ntalented&quot; program existed. She was allowed to go to the back of the room<br/>\nand learn things like typing and other stuff that seemed so cool, but<br/>\nwhich we weren&#39;t allowed to do. I also remember the G&T kids getting to<br/>\ngo on archeology digs while the rest of us stayed in school. The things<br/>\nthey were doing were still &quot;educational&quot; but they were intriguing in a<br/>\nway that rote math and reading were not. This is the way I think about<br/>\nthe schooly stuff we have around the house: it&#39;s there because it&#39;s<br/>\ncool, not because it will offer a specific lesson or a specific skill.<br/>\nIt&#39;s there to explore because someone may find it interesting, not<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a required subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got the kids an elementary chemistry set for Christmas, which I know<br/>\nwill prove to be one of their favorite gifts of all because they&#39;re into<br/>\nthat kind of thing. I&#39;ve found it really interesting and enlightening to<br/>\nwatch and analyze what about this gift is schooly vs. unschooly, and it<br/>\nillustrates quite well the difference that I&#39;m trying to get at. What<br/>\nI&#39;ve realized is that I&#39;m not going let dh use it anymore with the kids.<br/>\n;) He&#39;s just not far enough along yet on his unschooling journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids get to play around, follow their curiosity, experiment<br/>\nfreely, learn empirically about the different reactions and parts, then<br/>\nthis is a cool gift to strew in an unschooling way. When dh sits down<br/>\nwith them and performs a specific experiment, tells the kids to sit and<br/>\nwatch, won&#39;t let them use the test-tubes because *this* experiment<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require them, then it becomes a lesson and a disappointing,<br/>\nschooly gift with lots of rules and parameters that discourage genuine<br/>\ncuriosity and experimentation. Same gift, different outcome. See what I<br/>\nmean? That&#39;s the difference between strewing for genuine interest and<br/>\nstrewing a hidden curriculum, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing needs to be about all things interesting holding equal value<br/>\nand importance. We ought to be just as excited to strew some Teen Titan<br/>\ntoys that will fuel a current passion as we are about strewing that<br/>\nchemistry set because both will offer innumerable opportunities for<br/>\nlearning and exploration. I value learning--life-long learning, natural<br/>\nlearning, organic learning. I think we learn with every breath, that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat makes us sentient beings. I think it is impossible not to learn<br/>\nunless one actively shuts down and closes off the learning<br/>\nopportunity--that&#39;s what schools and lessons teach us to do, acting in<br/>\ndirectly antithetical ways to true learning. Unschooling to me isn&#39;t<br/>\nabout devaluing learning, but about valuing learning in all its forms,<br/>\nabout valuing the act of living itself as providing the means of<br/>\nlearning with every step and every breath.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example: I had some money from my mom to spend on the kids for<br/>\nChristmas, some of which I spent on beautiful wooden bead sets, some of<br/>\nwhich I spent at the bookstore. (I had intended to spend all of it at<br/>\nthis great art supply store, but it had closed down! I was very grumpy<br/>\nabout that.) From the bookstore, I bought:<br/>\n-- a book on knitting because Julia and I both would like to learn to knit<br/>\n--a book on MC Escher because Em and I had been talking about him<br/>\nrecently and the kids are into tessellations<br/>\n--a klutz book on magic<br/>\n--a klutz book on paper twirling, or quilling<br/>\n--a belly dancing kit, complete with finger cymbals, CD and DVD<br/>\n--a book on paper airplanes<br/>\n--a book of poetry for children, called _Animal Poems_ because it has<br/>\none of the kids&#39; favorite poems, &quot;Tyger&quot; by William Blake<br/>\n--a deck of Tarot cards<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a really practical example of the way I &quot;strew.&quot; I&#39;m also<br/>\nnotorious for buying things at museum gift shops--I buy all kinds of<br/>\nthings that look interesting. I&#39;ve gotten books, coloring books, nature<br/>\njournals, craft kits, rebus makers, instruments, CDs, cards and games. I<br/>\nbuy interesting stuff at the hardware store--spools of colored wire,<br/>\nfunnels, different size measuring tapes, seeds of plants we&#39;ve<br/>\nread/heard about. I buy cool computer game bundles at Sam&#39;s Club, pick<br/>\nup interesting books at the library, rent topical DVDs of stuff we&#39;re<br/>\ncurrently interested in, order toys online. I subscribe to magazines,<br/>\nbuy museum memberships, research vacations, explore new parks or<br/>\nclimbing areas. We have all kinds of stuff to explore and pull out in<br/>\nour home, none of which is required. Often, things sit for months, even<br/>\nyears before someone takes an interest in it or the moment presents<br/>\nitself to pull it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s probably a fine line somewhere between the kind of<br/>\nstrewing I do and blatant consumerism, but I&#39;m still discovering what<br/>\nthat is. ;)  How much do I spend on unschooling? Everything and nothing. *g*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s strewing page is good, but my favorite piece that<br/>\nillustrates most closely what I do is her &quot;House as a Museum&quot; piece.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/museum\">http://sandradodd.com/museum</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also an interesting thread along these lines going on now on the<br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, here&#39;s something from an essay I&#39;m working on now that touches on<br/>\nthis topic:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shelves, cabinets, baskets and bins are filled with goodies to explore<br/>\nand excite. I accumulate and acquire stuff with an obsessive quality<br/>\nthat rivals the above mother&#39;s obsession to control the stuff in her<br/>\nhome. As Unschoolers, we dive into topics with gusto, devouring all that<br/>\nwe can get our hands on and then moving onto the next entr√©e. Many<br/>\ntimes, I&#39;ll see something that whets my own appetite with its future<br/>\npromise and I pick it up, waiting for just the right time to pull it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also keep stuff forever, like the calligraphy set I picked up when I<br/>\nwas probably twelve or thirteen. Its multiple nibs and colors fascinated<br/>\nmy girls as we played with them and compared the pens to a quill my five<br/>\nyear old daughter had bought at Colonial Williamsburg. My husband&#39;s<br/>\nmolecule model set from college chemistry has also proven quite<br/>\ninteresting and offered hours of fun building in addition to<br/>\nillustrating conversations on water molecules and, most recently,<br/>\nchirality in nature spurred by Jim&#39;s work and Emily&#39;s recent interest in<br/>\ngenetic mutation, thanks to the X-men.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"diana jenner &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: .RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing too little?

I took a new  job, <br/>\nand they made me sit through 6 weeks of boring and dull training, with  tests.  <br/>\nAt the end there are two finals (different subjects).  If I  didn&#39;t pass the <br/>\nfinals, I didn&#39;t get to keep the job.<br/>\n <br/>\nHowever, I knew once I got through the training, all the information I  would <br/>\nneed while I&#39;m on the job would be at my fingertips in a book or a  computer, <br/>\nor from the person at the next desk.  I had been actually doing  the job <br/>\nunder supervision, and not studying as I had the first few weeks.   I was actually <br/>\ndoing the job.  When I was notified I would be taking the  final, I decided <br/>\nto cram for it as soon as I realized how many of the minute  details I had <br/>\nforgotten, or simply didn&#39;t use in the course of the job.   Yet, I needed to know <br/>\nthem ALL for these several moments in time where it would  all be put to the <br/>\ntest.  So, I crammed for the finals test, and I  passed.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShortly after that on the same day, they put me back on the job, which I  had <br/>\nbeen doing already, it was starkly clear that I would soon forget the  <br/>\ninformation I crammed in.  I remeber what I need for the job, and WHERE TO  FIND IT <br/>\nwhen I need it, and I&#39;m learning that better as I need it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s the binge and purge method.

But  honest-to-goodness <br/>\nconnections from your point of view to something he  definitely has in his point <br/>\nof view is not deliberate exposure.  It&#39;s  having a relationship with your kid. <br/>\n It&#39;s being excited about the  connection and helping him make the <br/>\nconnection, too.  Maybe he&#39;ll only make  the connection halfway, or maybe he won&#39;t see <br/>\nthe connection at all.  You  talked to your kid, though, and you shared some <br/>\nenthusiasm.<br/>\n <br/>\nWill and I talk in the car, mostly.  Well, he talks to me all the time  he&#39;s <br/>\nin my presence, but I&#39;m not interested in a lot of what he tells me about  <br/>\nSpongebob, so I tune out sometimes.  (When he really wants me to  listen, he says <br/>\nso.  Otherwise, he recognizes that I&#39;m not so interested  and he&#39;ll find <br/>\nsomething else to talk about!)  But I am interested  when talks to me about the <br/>\nmusic he&#39;s listened to recently, and I try to find  some relevance to Linkin <br/>\nPark in my life.  I told him about the Lincoln  Park Zoo in Chicago, where I went <br/>\na lot as a kid, and how I wonder if the Linkin  Park band has anything to do <br/>\nwith the zoo or Chicago.  So we make  connections to each other in that way.<br/>\n <br/>\nI can see the influence of the way my parents treated us as kids in my  <br/>\nparenting, too.  My mother didn&#39;t want to listen to arguments, ever.   Her word was <br/>\nlaw, and we couldn&#39;t be right.  Unfortunately, I inherited the  same trait.  <br/>\nI temper mine (I hope!).  I still see where the same  situations that I <br/>\nencountered with my mother are being recreated with my  children.

I almost got suspended over it.  I sat  there and <br/>\nargued how irrelevant whatever he was saying was to me.  This was  a particularly <br/>\nstodgy old skinny-60s-tie history teacher.  But I could find  no relevance to <br/>\nmy life to what he was trying to tell us about.  His  only defense was that <br/>\n&quot;someday&quot; history would mean more to me. <br/>\n <br/>\nWell, he was right.  Certain history does mean something to me,  now.  What I <br/>\nwas trying to get him to see was that I needed to be able to  *apply* what he <br/>\nwas saying in order to understand and he was doing a piss-poor  job of <br/>\nfinding relevance to the life of an 17 yo girl in 1979.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Will and I talk about historical things, I try to relate it to  his <br/>\nexperience in some way.  Our house is 110 years old, which is  usually a good <br/>\nreference point.  When he was younger, I used the year his  Poppy was born (1935) <br/>\nor when I was born (1962) or when his big brother was born  (1982).  Sometimes <br/>\nI say, &quot;When this house was brand new...&quot; and I  draw him a word picture <br/>\nabout what we&#39;re talking about.  In order to  draw that picture, I have to take <br/>\nstep backwards into what I know until I reach  what he knows (not always a <br/>\nlinear progression) and find that common  ground.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, he doesn&#39;t always see the common ground, or the steps of how I  <br/>\ngot from here to there.  But he&#39;s been exposed to something *beyond* what  he <br/>\nknow, and maybe he&#39;s put another hook on his model of the universe.   Only he <br/>\ncan tell you that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWill and I have had great fun being Lemony Snicket fans, and sharing other  <br/>\nbooks together, and being interested in baseball together.  So, maybe just  <br/>\ndeveloping an interest together would be helpful, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: .RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Doing too little?
