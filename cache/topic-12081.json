Ariel is 9 <br/>\nand when she was at Jenny&#39;s age she had that sense of just loving the world.  <br/>\nI saw that  disappear to a certain degree when she went into school for three <br/>\nyears.

We&#39;ve been home <br/>\none year and I see that enthusiasm for life coming back. <br/>\nShe had taught me how to &#39;see&#39; a butterfly again and reminded me how <br/>\nwonderful and  mysterious the world around us really is.  I had forgotten.  <br/>\nSince she is so intuitive,  she reminds me of those innate abilities I had <br/>\nshut off for so many years.   Now that I think about it, I mostly run my life <br/>\nnow through intuitive/gut feelings because I have found they never steer me <br/>\nwrong.

One of my friends <br/>\nsaid when his daughter was young she used to see &#39;colors&#39; around people, and <br/>\nI know my daughter has telekinetic abilities, she showed me once, but said <br/>\nshe never wanted to use it to make money or anything  because that would be <br/>\nwrong.  She was so matter of fact about the whole thing.  It suprised me at <br/>\nfirst, but there was a part that wasn&#39;t suprised at all, that knows there is <br/>\nso much more going on here than we can imagine.

She sounds like a great person.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also learn so much from my kids. Jenny, my baby, has been my joy teacher, <br/>\nas I have mentioned before. She is 3 now. When she was a baby she had to be <br/>\nin the garden every day. We would usually go out in the morning for <br/>\ncoffee-if we missed that time for some reason or other she would get fussy <br/>\nand we realized that was the problem so we would take her out for a bit and <br/>\nall would be fine. To her, a leaf falling onto the tray of her walker was a <br/>\nprecious gift from the heavens. She was filled with wonder at the song of a <br/>\nbird or a butterfly passing by. When that baby smiled, the joy came from <br/>\nevery ounce of her being. You can&#39;t be near that without realizing that <br/>\nthese things are available to us as well. Bliss truly is our inherent <br/>\nnature.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that she is 3, she talks so much more and I can show her so many things. <br/>\nShe has a garden of her own-full of zinnias so she can pick as many as she <br/>\nwants, and it attracts loads of those butterflys that she loves. We made a <br/>\npicture a few weeks ago from shapes that I cut out and she glued, of <br/>\nconstruction paper. It disappeared from the refrigerator, and I saw this <br/>\nlight in her face when I said &quot;We&#39;ll just have to make another on.&quot; She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize that we could do it again! Then she wanted to duplicate the <br/>\nfirst picture exactly-I suggested making it a night picture, and we made <br/>\nstars and a moon instead of a sun and clouds. You can see the connections <br/>\nand the ideas growing in her mind as the possabilities opened up for her. <br/>\nAnd I get to share it all-I get to see all the things that I have taken for <br/>\ngranted through these new eyes. I get to feel the joy and wonder at flowers <br/>\nand falling leaves and the magic that happens to a cookie through the window <br/>\nof the oven door. We share in the learning-I may be the one who knows how to <br/>\ncut the shapes or mix the dough, but she is the one teaching how wonderful <br/>\nit is to be able to.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, thanks for getting me inspired to write all of this-I think that now <br/>\nwith my house all quiet and the sun coming up I will turn off the computer <br/>\nand take my coffee to the garden! I have 4 more kids, so maybe tomorrow I <br/>\nwill write of another of my teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Cathie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JENNIFE30@...\">JENNIFE30@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] indigo children<br/>\n&gt;Date: Sun, 20 Aug 2000 20:13:26 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for this interview!  I got the book some months ago after having <br/>\n&gt;many<br/>\n&gt;people recommend it after meeting my daughter.

She has her own agenda and is <br/>\n&gt;very<br/>\n&gt;intelligent.

I have found there are a lot of<br/>\n&gt;adults that still believe in the &#39;be seen and not heard&#39; child, and those<br/>\n&gt;adults have a big problem with her.  The ones that don&#39;t think of children <br/>\n&gt;as<br/>\n&gt;inferior and as little people they need to &#39;control&#39; actually &#39;hear&#39; her <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;are amazed at the things that come out of her at times!   She also seems to<br/>\n&gt;naturally gravitate to people who are open and receptive to her and who <br/>\n&gt;treat<br/>\n&gt;her as an equal and to shy away from those who see her as less.  She has a<br/>\n&gt;hard time relating to a lot of kids and her best friends are other adults.<br/>\n&gt;She just walks right up to people and starts conversations and she&#39;s done<br/>\n&gt;this ever since she could walk and talk.  I never discouraged this, and it<br/>\n&gt;taught me how friendly and wonderful people actually are, as I would end up<br/>\n&gt;in the conversation when I came to get her.
