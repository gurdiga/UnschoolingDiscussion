I<br/>\nnever &quot;got&quot; math.  I could perform the calculations but I never understood<br/>\nwhat I was doing.  I simply memorized what went where and as soon as the<br/>\nclass was over, promptly forgot the equations.  I thought I was stupid in<br/>\nmath, regardless of the fact that I had a Bachelor of Science degree (heavy<br/>\non the math).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when I was about 34, I truly did have an epiphany.  I wasn&#39;t &quot;trying&quot;<br/>\nto learn something.  I was watching Bill Nye with my kids.  He was talking<br/>\nabout physics, again something I thought was just over my head for some<br/>\nreason, figured I just didn&#39;t think that way.  Watching this video, the<br/>\nlight came on.  I already KNOW this stuff.  It is just putting labels on<br/>\nthings I already know.  Suddenly, I understood math.  The equations just<br/>\ndescribe what I already know.  I can now remember the fractions stuff<br/>\nbecause I know what I&#39;m doing with it.  I understand why the denominators<br/>\nhave to match to add and subtract.  I GOT IT!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think your son is right in that math may well come to him as an<br/>\nepiphany and wrong in that he isn&#39;t stupid, just not ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58078,"nextTopicId":58081}}
