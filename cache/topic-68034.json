They brought the tape, recorded April 29, to officials&#39; attention and police arrested Duchow over the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuchow admitted slapping the child in anger and hitting him in the leg, according to the criminal complaint. The complaint notes that Jacob also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis parents played some of the tape for reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe driver can be heard shouting at Jacob because the boy is making bus engine noises, yelling and fiddling with his seat belt. At one point, the driver stops the bus and moves toward the boy, followed by what sounds like a hand slapping clothing. The driver can be heard threatening to break the boy&#39;s arm and beat him, and warns, ``Stop before I beat the living hell out of you.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nJacob, attends the Academy of Accelerated Learning, a Milwaukee public school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67792,"nextTopicId":68041}}
