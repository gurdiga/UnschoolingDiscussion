Without getting into too many specifics of the <br/>\nVirginia law here, there are 4 options for applying and for the most part<br/>\nwhere they say describe the curriculum you can get away with a couple of <br/>\nsentences describing the type of resources you are going to use (library, <br/>\nreading, field trips, etc) keeping it very generic. As far as the testing <br/>\ngoes...you do have to show &quot;proof of progress&quot; for 1st grade on up, however<br/>\nit is not as bad as it sounds. You can either pull together a portfolio for <br/>\nevaluation or take a standardized test (must score at least a 23%). <br/>\nFrom what I have read, most unschoolers seem to choose the testing as it is <br/>\nthe least intrusive (finding an evaluator who understands unschooling can be <br/>\ntricky). They just do not put any importance on the tests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not belong already, I would suggest joining the Virginia Eclectic<br/>\nHsing email list:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/VaEclecticHomeschool/?yguid=1572768\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/VaEclecticHomeschool/?yguid=1572768</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone is an unschooler, but there are many on there who might be<br/>\nable to help with your questions. This is also a great resource for any<br/>\nquestions that you might have with dealing with state law. I know that they<br/>\nhelped put my fears to rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also check out the following websites for more great info on hsing<br/>\nin Virginia.

Feel free to email me off-list if you have any questions.<br/>\nI do not claim to have all the answers, but I might be able to point you in the right<br/>\ndirection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I return to my lurkdom to enjoy and learn. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110563815,"authorName":"singbarbershop","from":"&quot;singbarbershop&quot; &lt;abaker242@...&gt;","profile":"singbarbershop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Online resources?","postDate":"1022727348","msgId":37851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFkNDRiaytzNTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37855,"prevInTime":37850,"nextInTime":37852,"topicId":37851,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello--I m a very recent addition to this list (about 2 minutes ago- LOL).
