I read your responses, said thanks and went to <br/>\nabsorb them.  then I sat down to watch some TV and let my pain meds do <br/>\ntheir job and relax.  Started watching Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya <br/>\nsisterhood.  Just so ya know, don&#39;t EVER watch that if you are feeling <br/>\ndown about your momming skills.  holy cow!  So I had a good cry and yet <br/>\nagain resolved to give myself a kick in the pants and quit whining.  <br/>\nThis crap has always been on my back, it isn&#39;t going anywhere, it&#39;s my <br/>\nchoice what to do with it, right?  Easier said than done, but attitude <br/>\ngoes a long way.  There is a mom and tot yoga class on Mondays that I <br/>\nthink I may peek into to see if me and Harriet *and* Crispin could go <br/>\nto with out disrupting the class.  He is 18 months, and kind of behind <br/>\ncompared to other kids his age.  We&#39;ll see.  I think if we eased into <br/>\nsome regular stuff like that, it may be easier for me to find away to <br/>\nshare my whole time (with Charles at work) with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the rest of you do for *me* time?  Do you forgo it completely?  <br/>\nMost times people say they do it after the kids are asleep.  I need to <br/>\nsleep from 10pm to 8 am to be human and humane.  Harriet and Crispin go <br/>\nto sleep with Daddy at about midnight and get up at 6:30 and rarely nap <br/>\nanymore.<br/>\nWe do swap with another couple to get date nights once a month or so.  <br/>\nWe just started that, so far so good.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHeather, mom to<br/>\nHarriet 12.15.99<br/>\nCrispin 01.25.02<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherette@...\">heatherette@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78129,"nextTopicId":78109}}
