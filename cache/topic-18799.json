It took awhile to get the message from their ears to their brains, \n<br>though. They didn&#39;t want to be teased (at their ages, especially the teens) \n<br>for running home and telling &quot;mommy and daddy&quot; but they finally understand \n<br>that being safe is far more important the names kids may call them for \n<br>telling my dh and I. Our police dept. is very concerned about the amount of \n<br>fighting around here and want to stop it (we live in a village of about 1500 \n<br>people ). Sadly most of the parents of these bullies could care less that \n<br>their children (boys AND girls) are this way. I can&#39;t even tell you how many \n<br>times my sons have been physically attacked by GIRLS and the boys &nbsp;tell me \n<br>how unfair that is, if boys can&#39;t hit girls then girls shouldn&#39;t be allowed \n<br>to hit boys. I HAVE tried talking to parents....it has never worked.\n<br>\n<br>So many of the kids around here labeled as trouble makers AREN&#39;T (mine have \n<br>this label).....they are kids that eventually get tired of the names other \n<br>kids call their parents/comments they make about their parents (especially \n<br>me...comments like &quot;how much does your mom charge&quot;, &quot;does your mom take a \n<br>credit card--after last night I want a running bill&quot;, etc..) , them (my sons \n<br>have heard MANY racist comments based on their being Jewish) and they &quot;stand \n<br>up for themselves&quot;. OR...the bullies tell their story and sound all innocent.\n<br>\n<br>I believe in the &quot;it takes a village to raise up a child&quot; philosophy and I \n<br>WELCOME the kids labeled as trouble makers in to my home. The 3 boys my older \n<br>2 sons hang around with (the 5 of them are a group of close friends) are \n<br>called trouble makers and they come here every single day, have spent the \n<br>night a few times and they LOVE being here. I always tell them how much I \n<br>appreciate them following our rules, tell them what great kids they are, etc. \n<br>and their faces just shine.....2 of the boys do NOT get this at home! I told \n<br>one &quot;if I ever find out you got in a fight, you aren&#39;t coming here anymore&quot; \n<br>and you know what? he has been walking away from confrontations, not mouthing \n<br>off back to name callers, etc.. He likes coming here too much to mess it up. \n<br>Last night we had 2 of the boys stay the night and they wanted to stay again \n<br>tonight!\n<br>\n<br>Anyway...sorry for rambling. It&#39;s late and I get a little hot under the \n<br>collar when I think of how many bullies wouldn&#39;t be bullies if they just had \n<br>parents who cared enough to say enough when a parent tells them what their \n<br>child has done instead of say &quot;not my kid&quot;. If an adult came here and told me \n<br>my boys had done something wrong you can bet that I would listen to them and \n<br>I would have a long talk with me sons!\n<br>\n<br><p

When he was finished, we followed him home and<br/>\nhe got in the van. Then we parked in an unobtrusive<br/>\nspot and watched for kids.

So we went around the<br/>\ncorner, and I parked, and Erik and Aubrey got out and<br/>\nnonchalantly walked past the group, while I was ready<br/>\nto spring out of the van, snapping photos and looking<br/>\nintimidating. But it wasn&#39;t the right boy. After they<br/>\npassed the boys, Aubrey grabbed Erik and was giving<br/>\nhim a noogie when I pullled up, so I snapped some<br/>\npictures of them, and as they climbed in, I said, &quot;I<br/>\ngot it!

I love the idea of taking a<br/>\npicture. One problem is that Erik doesn&#39;t know their<br/>\nnames, so I can&#39;t talk to their parents. But, some<br/>\nother kids were around the second time, and we&#39;ve told<br/>\nhim to ask those kids what the bullies&#39; names are. We<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know he brought the shovel the second time. In<br/>\nfact, I wouldn&#39;t have let him go alone the second<br/>\ntime, but I had just told him to go pick up some books<br/>\nhe&#39;d put on hold from the library (a block away in the<br/>\nother direction) and that&#39;s where I thought he was<br/>\nheading. I guess I was NOT being aware. My husband<br/>\nsort of pointed that out. <br/>\n<br/>\nErik says he&#39;s not afraid of the bullies. But I liked<br/>\nthe idea of driving the route, not with him, but sort<br/>\nof following and watching in a way that the bullies<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t know I was with him. And I&#39;ll have a camera.<br/>\nJust in case. <br/>\n<br/>\nI should have thought of the picture. Here&#39;s one of<br/>\nthose school stories I was asked not to tell, but this<br/>\none is relevant here. Erik was in second grade gym<br/>\nclass, horsing around in a non-violent but silly way<br/>\nwith a boy. The gym teacher apparently called the<br/>\nboys, who didn&#39;t hear her. So she marched over and<br/>\nGRABBED them by the front collars of their shirts,<br/>\nGOUGING four DEEP scratches into Erik&#39;s neck with her<br/>\nfingernails. When he got home, my husband took LOTS of<br/>\npictures, and we brought these to the principal. Turns<br/>\nout there was a student education major observing<br/>\nthere who would NOT stand up for the gym teacher.<br/>\nThat, with the pictures, got the teacher in trouble,<br/>\nbut not much.

We have always had trouble <br/>\nwith bullies and very rude public school kids. ( even at Bible School) Here <br/>\nthey have summer recreation activities that are sponsored by each towns, not <br/>\nschools. When the kids were younger they liked to go. They could ride the bus <br/>\nand go to swimming lessons, ice skating, baseball games, and etc. When my <br/>\nolder two girls (age 9 and 11) went alone they complained that the kids <br/>\nteases them on the bus. It ruined the whole trip. So I had an idea. In order <br/>\nfor my younger boys to go a parent was required to go too. So I going to <br/>\nusing the boys as my excuse to be there and the public school kids cooled it <br/>\nsome. The girls seemed so glad to have me there. Once when we were at an <br/>\narcade a big kid (twice my oldest girls size) bullied her. While my oldest <br/>\nwas waiting in line for tickets, with her littlest brother, this boy came <br/>\nalong and physically shoved her to the floor as hard as he could. She told me <br/>\nlater that she is not sure what happened next as instinct just kicked in. (5 <br/>\nyrs of karate by that time) She said she was off the floor before she hardly <br/>\ntouched it, she stepped in front of little brother, turned and nailed the <br/>\nbully with a palm strike. The good news was that right before the palm strike <br/>\nhit him in the nose she pulled it back (could have broke his nose). The bad <br/>\nnews was that one of her fingernails did catch his face accidentally and give <br/>\nhim a bad scratch. I had no idea any of this was going on as I was with the <br/>\nother two kids. Suddenly the youngest was there crying that his sister had <br/>\nbeen taken away for fighting. I found her being chewed out by the supervisor <br/>\nof the group (school teacher). She did not like that at all. Then the older <br/>\nbrother of the bully came and called me every swearing name you could think <br/>\nof. Said we would be hearing from their parents and lawyer. I said, we are in <br/>\nthe book, please tell them to call. The bully was sitting there crying his <br/>\neyes out. That was a little amusing to see. Now I do not condone fighting but <br/>\nself defense is self defense. The bully&#39;s family has four children that are <br/>\nall very large and tower over all the kids. They are bullies to everyone. <br/>\nLater at home dad said, if you are going to get in trouble anyway you should <br/>\nhave nailed him good. We never received the calls but we did stop going to <br/>\nrec activities because my kids said they were not worth the hassles. Too bad. <br/>\nLater I learned that my oldest was very scared of running into that bully <br/>\nwith a big group of his peers and not being able to defend herself and her <br/>\nsiblings. She always felt that defending her siblings was up to her. We do <br/>\nnot live in town so it never happened and now years have passed and all is <br/>\nwell. I am not sure what I would do if I were you. I agree with Sandra that <br/>\nthe shovel is a bad idea. They may take it from him and hit him with it. <br/>\nTrying to get the papers earlier and deliver them sooner is a good idea. I <br/>\nwould talk to the paper office and see if they have any ideas. After all they <br/>\nwant those papers delivered and good help is hard to find. If nothing else <br/>\nworks I would probably suggest quitting. Sad, but I would be that concerned <br/>\nfor his safety. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may ask your son if he would be interested in taking martial arts <br/>\nclasses. Not to fight but it really builds self esteem and they do teach some <br/>\ngreat self defense techniques. My kids love them and have been in classes for <br/>\nmany years. I take classes too. I know that they will not help in this <br/>\nsituation. Martial arts changed my two boys, for the better, but that is <br/>\nanother story.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!!<br/>\nCandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"&quot;Johanna&quot; &lt;saninocencio1@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"IajMRkR4q3TW6PxnAleu8vFqV9Zci2wAdBSeiR_O24xKsaGe-3mPVZV-W7ucKyX6II2UxmiSNfpXbMsr9Ae8YMZcl9hzuEvfLWdONQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"bullies","postDate":"987515278","msgId":18876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMwYzc0OCQ0MjZhMjg0MCQxMmVjYWRjZkBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":18858,"nextInTopic":18894,"prevInTime":18875,"nextInTime":18877,"topicId":18799,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you have a dog?

Feel free to tell me to shut up<br/>\n&gt; and go away for a while!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My ds, who is 10 and will be 11 in August has a paper route. This has<br/>\n&gt; been a fantastic experience for him. He&#39;s making friends with all<br/>\n&gt; sorts of neighbors. He&#39;s got this 94 yo buddy who lives alone and is<br/>\n&gt; thrilled to see him every day. He&#39;s handling his own money, very<br/>\n&gt; wisely, I might add. He&#39;s learned to organize his time. He&#39;s becoming<br/>\n&gt; independent about making decisions. It&#39;s all been great.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But today these middle schoolers bullied him. He doesn&#39;t know them.<br/>\n&gt; They sometimes follow him on his route on their bikes or make stupid<br/>\n&gt; comments. Part of the problem is his route time happens to be right<br/>\n&gt; when middle school gets out. His papers come right at that time and<br/>\n&gt; he has to be done by 5, so he can&#39;t wait for the middle school kids<br/>\n&gt; to get home and off the streets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, one kid rear-ended Erik (on bikes). Erik heard them<br/>\n&gt; saying, &quot;He&#39;s a wimp; let&#39;s get him!&quot; And he saw them speed up. So he<br/>\n&gt; jumped off his bike (scraping his knee) just a fraction of a second<br/>\n&gt; before the one kid rammed into his bike. Smart move, I thought. Then,<br/>\n&gt; he grabbed a  snow shovel lying in the yard where they were and<br/>\n&gt; reached out with the shovel and flipped off each of the three boys&#39;<br/>\n&gt; baseball caps with the handle. While they were retrieving their caps,<br/>\n&gt; he ran to Grandma&#39;s house and got a bandaid for his knee and waited<br/>\n&gt; until the kids left the sidewalk in front of Grandma&#39;s where they<br/>\n&gt; were waiting for him. Then he finished his route. But just as he was<br/>\n&gt; coming home, they came for him again. He rode fast, ran into the<br/>\n&gt; house and the boys left.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Then a guy called and said he didn&#39;t get his paper. No surprise,<br/>\n&gt; considering how distracted Erik must have been. Erik went out with<br/>\n&gt; the snow shovel from our garage this time, and the boys appeared<br/>\n&gt; again and surrounded him on their bikes. He did the baseball cap<br/>\n&gt; thing again and got away. I asked why they weren&#39;t prepared this time<br/>\n&gt; for the cap thing and he says they just aren&#39;t too bright. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; guessing maybe they thought it was funny the first time and let him<br/>\n&gt; do it again?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway... tomorrow and after... I&#39;m worried these boys will get him<br/>\n&gt; and beat him up or something. I&#39;m torn between leaving him to defend<br/>\n&gt; himself with his cleverness against their numbers and size or maybe<br/>\n&gt; going with him on the route? He has any number of houses to run to if<br/>\n&gt; the boys come after him when he&#39;s not on Grandma&#39;s street. In fact,<br/>\n&gt; earlier this winter, the boys were chasing him and he went into a<br/>\n&gt; neighbor&#39;s house to wait it out. Am I exposing him to danger by<br/>\n&gt; allowing him to keep the route? I don&#39;t want to baby him or<br/>\n&gt; overprotect him, but I thought bullying was a thing of the past when<br/>\n&gt; I took him out of school!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Call the police and tell them what is going on. Ask them to be \n<br>at the middle school at the time your son will be and ask him to speak to \n<br>these boys and get their names and he will go to their homes and speak to \n<br>their families. We live in a village in NE Ohio and just moved in last June. \n<br>In this time my sons have had MANY problems simply because they are the &quot;new \n<br>kids.&quot; I finally got tired of the confrontations and now I call the police. \n<br>Today a group of 3 boys stopped my sons and 2 of their friends and called \n<br>names &amp; asked them (my boys and their friends) to meet them up at the school \n<br>at 2p. They came home and told me and I phoned the police who went up to the \n<br>school at 2p, instead of my boys and their friends, and spoke to them. The \n<br>police here are trying to stop the fighting....in March there was a situation \n<br>where my boys were confronted by 3 OTHER boys and a fight followed (we do not \n<br>tolerate or encourage physical confrontations or verbal confrontations and \n<br>ask the boys to walk away but at times human emotions take over) and the \n<br>police were called. The 3 other boys and my boys and their families (4 \n<br>families all together) had to attend a meeting up at Town Hall to discuss the \n<br>situation and to rectify it. All 7 boys were told by the police that if ANY \n<br>of them were in 1 more fight EVER they would end up processed at the police \n<br>dept.. The other 3 boys have already ended up processed. Mine have not. The \n<br>police are aware that I will call EVERY time there is a problem and they \n<br>encourage me to do so. And I will, believe me.\n<br>\n<br>Also....my 10yo will be 11 in August and there is NO WAY he could handle \n<br>himself against a group of middle school aged children. I wouldn&#39;t allow to \n<br>even be in this situation alone. If your son were 13-14 I would say, don&#39;t \n<br>baby him. But your son is 10 and these children are much older and 10 is \n<br>really not old enough to deal with these things. I would go with my son OR I \n<br>would call the police. \n<br>\n<br>Just my thoughts.\n<br>\n<br></b></font><font COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE=\"2\" FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" FACE=\"Arial\">\n<br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote TYPE=\"CITE\" style=\"BORDER-LEFT:#0000ff 2px solid;MARGIN-LEFT:5px;MARGIN-RIGHT:0px;PADDING-LEFT:5px;\">But today these middle schoolers bullied him.
