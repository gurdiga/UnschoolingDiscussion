From: The Internet TourBus - A virtual tour of cyberspace [mailto:TOURBUS@LISTSERV.AOL.COM] On Behalf Of Bob Rankin Sent: Tuesday, May 15, 2001 11:01 PM ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1807457265\">-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: The Internet TourBus - A virtual tour of cyberspace<br/>\n[mailto:TOURBUS@...] On Behalf Of Bob Rankin<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 15, 2001 11:01 PM<br/>\nTo: TOURBUS@...<br/>\nSubject: TOURBUS - 15 May 01 - The End of Spam?<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n Spam Filtering: It Works!<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last issue I mentioned BrightMail, a company offering a spam<br/>\nfiltering system that&#39;s being used by service providers such as<br/>\nEarthlink/Mindspring, AT&T Worldnet, and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked for feedback from people who use the Brightmail/Spaminator<br/>\nservice and I got lots of it.  The almost universal response was that<br/>\nspam levels went down dramatically after switching on the filter, and<br/>\nthat instances of the filter catching non-spam emails was very rare.<br/>\nHere is some of the feedback I received:<br/>\n<br/>\n - I activated the spam filter and it immediately reduced the spam.<br/>\n - To say the level of SPAM went down with BrightMail is an<br/>\n   understatement.  It almost disappeared.<br/>\n - Only the occasional spam gets through now.<br/>\n - I was afraid Spaminator would filter out mail from mailing lists<br/>\n   I&#39;m on (such as this), but it recognized them as desired.<br/>\n - It even blocked the HaHa virus.<br/>\n - Now I don&#39;t worry about spam at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your ISP offers the Brightmail/Spaminator filter give it a try. It<br/>\nseems to suppress almost ALL unwanted spam and viruses; and it gives<br/>\nyou the ability to review the filtered messages.  If your ISP DOESN&#39;T<br/>\noffer the Brightmail service, tell them you want it or switch to one<br/>\nthat does.<br/>\n<br/>\n   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.earthlink.net&quot;&gt;<br/>\n   Earthlink - http://www.earthlink.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.att.net&quot;&gt;<br/>\n   AT&T WorldNet - http://www.att.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n   &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.hiwaay.net&quot;&gt;<br/>\n   Hiwaay - http://www.hiwaay.net &lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Beginning of the End?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is VERY encouraging news to me.  It seems that we have some<br/>\ntechnology at hand that comes very close to solving the spam problem<br/>\nentirely.  If a majority of ISP&#39;s adopted Brightmail or something<br/>\nsimilar, it could signal the end of spam.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt eliminates the spammers&#39; complaint that ISP&#39;s who filter are<br/>\nviolating their &quot;free speech&quot; rights, because users decide whether or<br/>\nnot to use the filter.  It also eliminates the need to track down and<br/>\npunish spammers. What could be worse than being ignored?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it would make anti-spam laws completely unnecessary.  I have never<br/>\nbelieved that involving lawyers and legislators in the process would<br/>\ndo anything to solve the spam problem.  Technology created the<br/>\nproblem, and technology seems to be solving it - hooray!<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================[ Tourbus Rider Information ]===================<br/>\n   The Internet Tourbus - U.S. Library of Congress ISSN #1094-2238<br/>\n     Copyright 1995-2001, Rankin & Crispen - All rights reserved<br/>\n<br/>\n Help the hungry, poor and sick - for free!  http://FreeDonation.com<br/>\n<br/>\n      Subscribe, Signoff, Archives, Free Stuff and More at the<br/>\n              Tourbus Website - http://www.TOURBUS.com<br/>\n=====================================================================</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21350,"nextTopicId":21294}}
