I used a old<br/>\ntreddle machine, no electric power all,<br/>\nfoot control.  My son has been sewing with me for a while using the<br/>\nelectic machine.  Mostly he just pushes the<br/>\npeddle and pretends he&#39;s driving a car.  He has also sewn a little bag<br/>\nfor himself.  He&#39;s now 6, he probably sewed<br/>\nthat bag when he was 4 with my hands guiding with the fabric through the<br/>\nmachine.  He&#39;ll be helping with<br/>\nChristmas presents this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13167,"nextTopicId":13175}}
