Sandra, what&#39;s your <br/>\nthoughts?<br/>\nHow can we handle this without leaving on bad terms? There I go with the word <br/>\nbad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>\nrelationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either and<br/>\n <br/>\nhe&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going to<br/>\n <br/>\nbreath now. Thank-you to anyone that can pass some wisdom to us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called emotional blackmail. They are not healthy, happy people...why would you let them dictate your lives?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading Barbara Sher&#39;s &quot;Wishcraft&quot; and she talks about households that produce winners. She makes a point that winners are happy to see others acheiving their life goals, they enjoy seeing others succeed and applaud them.<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re surrounded by winners right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are responsible for the happiness of yourself, your dh and son right now. Do what is right for you. It&#39;s not like you haven&#39;t held op3en the door for a good relationship with them, you aren&#39;t cutting yourselves off in any way!! THEY are.<br/>\nYou are not responsible for them any longer. You will  write, visit etc...that&#39;s all you can do. Their anger and fear is not your problem.<br/>\nDon&#39;t carry their garbage around with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74148,"nextTopicId":74153}}
