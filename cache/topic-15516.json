The &quot;official&quot; position of the Pope is anti-birth control.  However, in the US, most churches realize are somewhat more lax on certain issues.  And while abstinence is taught and obviously taken as the position of the church, we are also not ignorant of todays society. So people aren&#39;t stoned because they chose to use bc.  Most people would agree that given the choice of using bc or having an abortion, bc is the better of the two &quot;evils&quot;. It is (in my humble opinion) wrong to have an abortion. I consider myself pro-choice.... the choice part is chosing to have sex in the first place, unprotected or otherwise. As with all choices in life, there are consequences. This one being the possibility of pregnancy.

Duty.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a fundamentalist Christian, and I honestly understand their drive <br/>\nto proselytize and to help prevent sin.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristianity in its fundamental forms (devout Catholicism; Southern Baptists <br/>\nand their ilk) do not see &quot;their beliefs&quot; and &quot;other&#39;s beliefs.&quot;  They see <br/>\nTRUTH and Satanic evil.  There is some benevolent ignorance, and those people <br/>\nmight yet come to be saved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd naturally, the Catholics and the Baptists see one another as part of the <br/>\nSatanic evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I understand it in Christian terms, but I don&#39;t like to keep on seeing it <br/>\nin homeschooling discussions.  There are hundreds of thousands of families <br/>\nwho homeschool because they believe God told them to--because they want their <br/>\nchildren to associate only with likeminded Christians (that&#39;s what statement <br/>\nof faith groups are all about), and they&#39;re raising the next generation of <br/>\nAmerican leadership, leaders who won&#39;t be confused by all kinds of <br/>\npolitically correct, critical-thinking nonsense, but will be Steeped in the <br/>\nTRUTH of God.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose homeschoolers sometimes cannot fathom why others would homeschool.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re not all doing the same thing.   Sometimes unschooling families who want <br/>\ntheir children to be independent thinkers are more anethema to strictly <br/>\ncontrolling families than general schoolgoing families are.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-...while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all prescribe to the rules <br/>\nof your god.  This seems totally unfair and hypocrital of you.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, from their point of view to adopt a &quot;to each his own&quot; attitude would be <br/>\nto condemn non-believers to hell.  They NEED to try to convert others.  Jesus <br/>\ncommanded it.   They&#39;re not trying to be obnoxious, they&#39;re trying to show us <br/>\nthe one true way to live forever in joy.  I&#39;m serious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also serious when I expressed amusement that in the very same week <br/>\nbirth control clinics are condemned but dog breeding is condemned too.  NO <br/>\nmore dogs; LOTS more people.  But it wasn&#39;t logic, it was religion, and I <br/>\nforgot that for a second.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\none of over six billion cousins of monkeys</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Laura M","from":"&quot;Laura M&quot; &lt;lauramatec@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"09vzdkZgpQiHxudTOPctDnmfK20Day40IEpb0JcqHG9Inzw1U_-AaIsiDCcu0X54A8LA91nt917vg6X7h3mZRrhI1mKaZrANcA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: raising dogs & pro-life","postDate":"980901755","msgId":15516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY5MHltUTFXRTlxbDJSa2VTOFkwMDAwMDg4MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15521,"prevInTime":15515,"nextInTime":15517,"topicId":15516,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
