We were at the <br/>\n&gt;Fairgrounds for 4H. and I was sitting on the ground w/my dd&#39;s club. I <br/>\n&gt;never thought of fleas!!!  I got many many bites all over my legs and <br/>\n&gt;thighs. they get red, hot  & painfully itchy.  does anyone know of any <br/>\n&gt;herbal o homeopathic remedies for this?  I kept me up last night(along <br/>\n&gt;with the person who called about homeschooling at 12:30am!!!!! but that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;another story!)<br/>\n&gt;  thanks<br/>\n&gt;   Debra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[This message contained attachments]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11338,"nextTopicId":11374}}
