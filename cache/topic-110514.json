And the trip before last, I had <br/>\ntwo people ask me questions as I was meandering and mumbling and <br/>\nhelped them find what they were looking for. I think maybe it&#39;s <br/>\nbecause having DS around I tend to be more outward focused (focusing <br/>\nmore on him than on my inside world) and moving a bit more slowly <br/>\nand that&#39;s become habit. Pre-DS I used to turbo shop - speed through <br/>\nwithout pausing to look around and make sure not to go on the day <br/>\nthat the senior citizens bus was there. Now I relax, maybe say a <br/>\nword or two to someone here and there, chat with the cashier and bag <br/>\nperson, help the mom in the car next to mine get her groceries in <br/>\nthe trunk ASAP because a storm is coming and she&#39;s got an infant on <br/>\nhand, and so on.

It&#39;s how I think through things and make sure things get done. I&#39;m sure many of you saw me doing that at the conference! &lt;bwg&gt; I just chat away at myself!<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I specifically do it when I&#39;m with my (when-they-were-younger) boys (they&#39;re not so keen on it any more---they&#39;d rather I think to myself more! &lt;g&gt;). But it helped them to *see* what I was thinking or how I came up with the reasons why/where/how to do something.<br/>\n <br/>\nToo often I think adults DON&#39;T talk to children about what they&#39;re doing or thinking. The children have no idea where those thoughts came from---what process was used to get to the end. They don&#39;t see us struggle with day-to-day thoughts and ideas. *I* think we need to talk more.<br/>\n <br/>\nChatty, chatty me,<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1379016,"authorName":"Kathleen Whitfield","from":"Kathleen Whitfield &lt;kmckernan@...&gt;","profile":"kathwhit2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Forced discussion vs. genuine","postDate":"1133914666","msgId":110530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJGQkI2QTI5LjQ5NTgwJWttY2tlcm5hbkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU4QjY4M0MyLTBFQzUtNDY5NC04NDgxLUVEN0EzOEI2MkQ5NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110526,"nextInTopic":110538,"prevInTime":110529,"nextInTime":110531,"topicId":110514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hear that kind of thing all the time where I live (LA), where many people are trying to be the Perfect Mom, Perfect Wife, Perfect Fill-in-the-Blank -- and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-430759879\">I hear that kind of thing all the time where I live (LA), where many people<br/>\nare trying to be the Perfect Mom, Perfect Wife, Perfect Fill-in-the-Blank --<br/>\nand let everyone elseknow how perfect they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 12/6/05 3:54 PM, Sandra Dodd at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I&#39;m not at all saying you witnessed a recovering bad mom, but that it<br/>\n&lt;reminds me of a couple of times people were (seemingly) showing off<br/>\n&lt;for others around them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Forced discussion vs. genuine","postDate":"1133913266","msgId":110523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4QjY4M0MyLTBFQzUtNDY5NC04NDgxLUVEN0EzOEI2MkQ5NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMDMwMWM1ZmE4NSRiMGI1MTkyMCQ3NDAwYThjMEBtb21zbGFwdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAxMDMwMWM1ZmE4NSRiMGI1MTkyMCQ3NDAwYThjMEBtb21zbGFwdG9wPg=="},"prevInTopic":110521,"nextInTopic":110524,"prevInTime":110522,"nextInTime":110524,"topicId":110514,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Let&#39;s keep going&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fabulous choice. You picked out a really great card!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now we have to go buy detergent, so that we can wash our clothes. That way if you get paint or glue on them at preschool we can get them clean. Hop on the back of the cart and let&#39;s go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the little boy never said anything, during the entire time I saw them. Maybe he just can&#39;t yet talk. He had a glazed over look on his face. Yes..only my observation I know....<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that she was following the advice of some experts like &quot;super nanny&quot; to engage him in the process, to keep him from melting down or such. But the whole conversation was very unnatural. She seemed to speak extra loud (although I don&#39;t believe the child was hard of hearing), perhaps for the benefit of other&#39;s to hear, or maybe just because she was trying to keep his attention. I remember John Holt once mentioning in a book, about commenting on what you&#39;re doing &quot;now we&#39;ll put on the coat and zip it up&quot; etc., but he also mentioned that it had to be natural.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just wondering what you think about this type of  activity. Forced teaching/conversation. Obviously it&#39;s wonderful to include and engage our children in the activities we are doing. But is forced or almost scripted conversation good with younger children, or is better to just answer questions, be genuine, share your own thoughts etc. I tend to do the latter. Just sort of curious.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110563,"nextTopicId":110589}}
