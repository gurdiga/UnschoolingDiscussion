To learn to assess when something is providing less than what<br/>\nit&#39;s taking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a few swimming lessons worth the price your son is paying in feeling he<br/>\nis being held prisoner by money, you, the teacher, society&#39;s thoughts of him<br/>\nas a quitter?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to respond to this. My son Eric has been learning <br/>\nto play the violin the past year. This was his own choice after watching the <br/>\nmovie &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; with Meryl Streep. He loved playing. Recently he <br/>\nhas decided that he needs to take a break from weekly structured lessons. He <br/>\nsaid that he feels now that he&#39;s only practicing for the instructor&#39;s sake <br/>\nand not his own. <br/>\n       <br/>\nI e-mailed the concerns to his instructor. Though understanding of his <br/>\ndecision, she really wants him to &quot;work through this low time and make it <br/>\nthrough his first book to get his reward&quot;. She doesn&#39;t think that he&#39;ll <br/>\npractice in the interim if he is not having lessons. Eric read the e-mail <br/>\nresponse and wants to stick with his decision to stop lessons. He said that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t play to get ribbons for completing something. He also wants to <br/>\nwork on the songs that he&#39;s already learned to perfect them and not add more <br/>\njust to complete a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had just read Joyce&#39;s response above before I opened his instructors <br/>\nresponse. I agree. What good does sticking with something do if you&#39;re not <br/>\ndoing it for yourself? I told Eric that it was his decision. You should have <br/>\nseen his face knowing that I trusted him to decide. It was worth the chance <br/>\nthat his instructor may not have a place for him when he&#39;s ready to resume <br/>\nlessons (if that happens at all). <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, you&#39;re so right. This is a trust with my son that I could never buy <br/>\nback if I had forced him to continue lessons just to say that he&#39;d stuck with <br/>\nsomething. I am generally a person that likes to stick with something until <br/>\ncompletion, but I&#39;ve also learned when to bow out. I also don&#39;t want my <br/>\nchildren to quit whenever something gets a little difficult. I think that&#39;s <br/>\nwhy many people adopt the stick with it mentality. It&#39;s a hard decision to <br/>\nmake, but a decision that has to be made individually. Hopefully my son will <br/>\nlearn when to perservere and when to quit. Thank you all for discussing the <br/>\ndownside to that attitude. I see both viewpoints. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I lurk, I get so much from reading the discussions. Thanks for <br/>\nthe support.<br/>\n<br/>\nGinny from Virginia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40097,"nextTopicId":40321}}
