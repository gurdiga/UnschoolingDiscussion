Call the company or search through<br/>\nsome of the academic sales places online to see if they have &quot;academic<br/>\npricing&quot; for this program. I just found out that Adope Photoshop 7 which<br/>\nwould cost me about $650 locally can be had for about $280 through academic<br/>\npricing. Each product has different rules. SOmetimes you need to be a school<br/>\nbut I started seeing that many of these (expensive ) programs are also sold<br/>\nto homeschoolers for that price!!!<br/>\nAlso I saw some on ebay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few stores online -these were sites recommended by a company that<br/>\nhas plugins for Adobe Photoshop. I don&#39;t think they have what you need but<br/>\nthis is good info for all interested in getting what they are buying at a<br/>\nlower cost.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.academicsuperstore.com\">http://www.academicsuperstore.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.a-plus-computing.com/\">http://www.a-plus-computing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.creationengine.com/html/pr_search.html\">http://www.creationengine.com/html/pr_search.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gotrc.com/\">http://www.gotrc.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis site has a classroom program of Hooked on Phonics but looks more<br/>\nexpensive as there is more than one copy.
