My 5 yr <br/>\nold used to like playing it she didn&#39;t do the missions (she couldn&#39;t read <br/>\nthem) she used to like driving the cars and running people over. I think she <br/>\nliked the splats. The splats are more or less the same as you get on Frogger <br/>\nbut we don&#39;t have frogger it&#39;s just how I remember it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is I hate GTA it makes me cringe if I accidentaly run someone over <br/>\nonit,but she doesn&#39;t see them as &#39;real people because they&#39;re not. It&#39;s <br/>\nobvious they&#39;re not people.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe plays roller coaster Tycoon and she plays that, not by building rides <br/>\nbut by coralling the people and keeping them hanging in the air. It&#39;s the <br/>\nway she plays. She wouldn&#39;t run anyone over or coral people in real life <br/>\nbecause she is playing an imaginative game not real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional fairy stories used to be much more gory than they are now. They <br/>\ncontinue to get more and more &#39;prettied&#39; up. In the original Snow White&#39;s <br/>\nwicked Stepmother was made to dance in white hot iron shoes. Also in <br/>\nCinderella the ugly sisters had their eyes plucked out by Ravens in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor every murder now there were 10 in the medieval period. I really don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve in the &#39;good old days&#39; when children were innocent  blah blah. My <br/>\ngrandad was expected to go out to work full time at age 14. Most kids looked <br/>\nafter their siblings and worked even when at school. How many boy soldiers <br/>\nlost their lives in the civil war (USA)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was no time when everything was rosy, it was much worse and anything <br/>\nnasty was swept under the carpet. In Victorian England the child prostitutes <br/>\nwere blamed for prostitution and the tempting of young men.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea why the big deal about GTA, its a GAME! If games made you <br/>\nviolent then we&#39;d all be out hacking each other to peices for cripes sake. <br/>\nAny child who genuinely gets obsessed with real violence would get obsessed <br/>\nwith other types of stuff if the games weren&#39;t available, maybe WW2 natzis <br/>\nor commandos or cowboys or exercet missiles or saddam hussien or criminals <br/>\nin the news or spys or assassins of US presidents or Tom and Jerry or <br/>\nANYTHING. Games don&#39;t cause mental illness or violent behaviour PEOPLE do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t talk to your child, if they are too afraid to talk to you, if <br/>\nthey feel you won&#39;t listen, if they know you&#39;ll shout at them and punish <br/>\nthem if they do talk to you, if they feel you will take something away from <br/>\nthem if they talk to you, then you will never know if there&#39;s anything <br/>\nseriously wrong with your child until the day when it&#39;s obvious that there <br/>\nis and it&#39;s too late and you are left bewildered and looking around for <br/>\nsomething to blame like Games or TV.
