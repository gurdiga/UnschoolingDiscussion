By <br/>\nthat time, the damage is done. Personally, I&#39;d avoid the poison and <br/>\nI&#39;d avoid public school. I think it poisons children&#39;s minds with the <br/>\nconcepts that they need someone else to teach them in order to learn, <br/>\nthat adults can and should control every aspect of their lives, that <br/>\nwhat 30 other children their own age think about their clothes <br/>\nmatters more than anything else in the world, that what those in <br/>\nauthority say about an issue is the definitive word, and many more <br/>\nthings that I really don&#39;t want my kids to learn. If I ever started <br/>\nhaving doubts as to whether or not I should send my kid to PS, I <br/>\nwould go back and read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Six-Lesson Schoolteacher&quot; <br/>\nagain and again until I stopped :-)  ( <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html\">http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason kids look forward to going to public school is the <br/>\noverwhelming propaganda and cultural machine that makes sure kids get <br/>\nexcited about it. Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her <br/>\nspecific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school. <br/>\nMore time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn? <br/>\nRiding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange <br/>\nfor her without also burdening her with school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each <br/>\nchild is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for <br/>\nmy children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventor of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"j5EDma3ILRSm5vyW2fvs9bme5I2NKwXekV4Lgt9mHepwxxVvyhp8E0_RrBH4gGzrvTWICGq5gUxzeZecQ4zRshRC0_AyuNJklWYcoNjD","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: First grade (was I&#39;ve Had Enough)","postDate":"990130719","msgId":21365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBHREgwMEdLVlhSM1FIQG10YTcucGx0bjEzLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21386,"prevInTime":21363,"nextInTime":21366,"topicId":21365,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... the ...
