Its a conversation I&#39;ve had with friends about MY personal ability to commit to unschool If I have what it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not unsure of my ability to work and homeschool, I&#39;ve done that for now for 3 of the 5 years we have been homeschooling. It can be done...I actually think that it is easier to homeschool and work then unschooling which seems like an on call type of thing. And mentally I&#39;m just not as avalible to my son&#39;s intrests as I might need to be. When you do &quot;school at home&quot; you know you have this set amount of time each day you will be &quot;schooling&quot; and then can move on to your intrests or in my case take that afternoon nap before I go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore then anything I&#39;m working through all of this and dealing with a depressing week.
