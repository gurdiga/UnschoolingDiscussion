But then, when I re-read it again in this post (below) I <br/>\nthought, ya know... she&#39;s exactly right!  I&#39;ve been trying to believe <br/>\nthat she (MY mom) did the best she could for us under her <br/>\ncircumstances. But ya know what? She *didn&#39;t* do the best she <br/>\ncould.... she took a part time job to get *away* from all of us <br/>\n(there were five) because she never got any help from my dDad.

She only lives 15 minutes away, but I probably see her less <br/>\nthan 10 times per year.  My husband tried to bring us closer together <br/>\nfor years, but finally gave up.  Her abrasiveness and rudeness finally <br/>\ngot to him and now he refuses to invite her over for dinner anymore.  <br/>\nShe is very unpredictable and you never know what to expect when you see <br/>\nher.  Sometimes she&#39;s sweet and pleasant and other times she&#39;s very rude <br/>\nand insulting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys used to spend a couple of days a month with her when they were <br/>\nyounger.  They&#39;ll be 8 soon.  They now make it clear they don&#39;t want to <br/>\nspend so much time with her anymore.  About 2 years ago she threw a <br/>\nglass of water in Leroy&#39;s face because he was crying.  I had never seen <br/>\nhim so upset before, and it brought back memories of how angry, unhappy <br/>\nand upset I used to be when I was her child.  I decided then that my <br/>\nboys didn&#39;t need to be around her and we rarely see her now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I am a better mother than she was and I do everything I can to <br/>\nmake sure my relationships with my boys will remain loving ones forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sorry for her because she&#39;s all alone and I&#39;m the only child in <br/>\ntown.  My brother is in NYC and my sister is in Ohio.  Everyone, <br/>\nincluding my 2 uncles (her brothers) are angry at me because I don&#39;t <br/>\nspend more time with her.  But, I have decided, that my boys are more <br/>\nimportant to me than she is.  She had her chance with me years ago.  I&#39;m <br/>\nmuch too busy with my boys to worry about her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, December 27, 2001, at 05:45 PM, Sarah Carothers wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Nicki,<br/>\n&gt; In a nutshell, I don&#39;t :( .
