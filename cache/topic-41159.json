I&#39;m no theologian, but I&#39;ll try to wing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOrthodoxy (small &quot;o&quot;) teaches that God is a Trinity, three persons in one: <br/>\nGod the Father -- God; God the Son -- Jesus or Christ; and God the Holy <br/>\nSpirit -- the Spirit of God dwelling in believers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of Christ&#39;s mission on the Cross was to be forsaken -- on our behalf and <br/>\nfor our sins -- by God. &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; There was <br/>\nthat period of time when Christ was separated from God.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a book on my shelf by Dorothy Sayers, that probably gets into this <br/>\nvery thing. Now that you&#39;ve piqued my interest, I&#39;m gonna go read it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBob<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41157,"nextTopicId":41161}}
