One afternoon I was<br/>\njust desperate for a little peace and quiet.

Thunder Girl&#39;s power is her *very* loud voice which she<br/>\nuses in order to warn people of iminent danger. She can also use the force<br/>\nof the sound waves to break apart boulders blocking roads, etc. Accalia<br/>\nthought it was fun for a while, but unfortunately Thunder Girl really didn&#39;t<br/>\ncatch on when it came to reining in her powerful voice very often :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAmy<br/>\nMama to Accalia (6/14/99) and Cole (9/03/02)<br/>\n&quot;Allow children to be happy in their own way, for what better<br/>\nway will they find?&quot;<br/>\n--Dr, Samuel Johnson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thissideofsomewhere.blogspot.com/\">http://thissideofsomewhere.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Amy -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What a great idea!

It&#39;s so good to be free of that and all the crappy expectations of<br/>\nmy kids that come along with it. The kids are so happy, like I&#39;ve lifted a<br/>\nhuge burden off their shoulders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to have you back!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n </span></blockquote><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I took my boys to the story time at the bookstore this <br/>\nmorning.  Of course, my little one is picking up every book, <br/>\nignoring the reading and threw his cookie at a little girl who <br/>\nwanted his book (ooppss).  I really did not care, except for the <br/>\ncookie thing ;)  They had these worksheets to color at the end and I <br/>\nasked my 5yo if he wanted to do those or go play with his brother <br/>\nwho was already over at the thomas toys.  He went to play, and the <br/>\nfact that he turned down the &quot;educational&quot; activity did not bother <br/>\nme at all.  In fact, it looked pretty boring compared to wandering <br/>\nthe store. <br/>\n<br/>\nI offered my 5 yo all sorts of books.  Of course the only ones that <br/>\nget him excited are &quot;Captian Underpants&quot; and &quot;Yu-gi-oh&quot;..LOL!  Fine, <br/>\nthat is what we get.  I never would have done that before.  I would <br/>\nhave told him those were for older kids and directed him to other <br/>\nareas. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids played until they had had enough and it was a nice change.  <br/>\nI always felt I was an easy going mom but I realize now how many <br/>\nlittle things I felt the need to control.  Certainly, I was not <br/>\ngoing to expose him to &quot;junk&quot; like the above.  Now I figure, if he <br/>\nis interested in me reading it to him than what the heck.  Who am I <br/>\nto tell him he can&#39;t be interested in something or I always know <br/>\nbest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll these little changes are really from this list and listening to <br/>\nall the discussions and trusting, especially trusting my children <br/>\nwho are pretty cool and fun kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, it is so good to start getting back to normal around here!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80142,"nextTopicId":80335}}
