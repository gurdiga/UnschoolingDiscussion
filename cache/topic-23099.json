He<br/>\nidentified himself as Aaron Devonshire. He claimed he had read an article I<br/>\nhad written for the July/August 2001 issue of Home Education Magazine. At the<br/>\ntime, I was not home, but my husband spoke with him very briefly. My husband<br/>\nsuggested he speak with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that evening, he called again. This time, I spoke with him for<br/>\napproximately 20 minutes. He explained that he was a student at NYU, working<br/>\non a thesis. He said part of the project involved doing a survey of parents<br/>\nregarding education. He went on to say the survey was studying both<br/>\ntraditional schooling and homeschooling. He asked some very generic<br/>\nquestions: How long have you been homeschooling? Why did you start<br/>\nhomeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nI did ask if he had REALLY read my article because these questions were<br/>\nanswered in that article. He claimed he did but wanted to verify.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe then asked my opinion on whether I thought my kids were learning better or<br/>\nthe same in homeschooling. He asked if we used traditional materials or if I<br/>\nput together my own curriculum.  Then, the conversation turned very strange.<br/>\nHe asked what kind of discipline I use in my homeschool. Did I use corporal<br/>\npunishment? No, I told him I did not. He persisted, asking if I was sure I<br/>\nnever spanked the kids. I told him no, and I did not see what this had to do<br/>\nwith education.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went on to tell me that accorinding to his results, 82% of homeschoolers<br/>\nuse corporal punishment. He said that of those 82%, 62% use the &quot;traditional<br/>\nmethod&quot;, spanking the child on the rear while the child lays across the<br/>\nparents lap. He also told me that most of these parents use a paddle or some<br/>\nother device to spank.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told him that our conversation was over, that I did not think corporal<br/>\npunishment was relevant to a study on education. He then asked if he could<br/>\nspeak to my son. I told him my son was not interested. At this point, he<br/>\nbecame upset, telling me I was a &quot;permissive parent&quot; for not making my son<br/>\nspeak to an adult. I told him that I would not make my son speak with anyone.<br/>\nI then hung up the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe very next day, I decided to contact NYU. I was able to speak to a<br/>\ngentleman in the admissions office by the name of Craig Griffin. He took all<br/>\nof the information, including the phone numbers that showed up on my<br/>\nCaller-ID, and told me he would see what he could come up with. Within an<br/>\nhour, he called back to let me know that there is no such student registered<br/>\nat the university. The phone numbers did not match any in their database,<br/>\neither. He also said that a student doing a project would never ask to speak<br/>\nto a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did receive one more call from the &quot;student&quot; on July 31. He asked for me,<br/>\nand told me had some other questions. I told him I had questions, too, and<br/>\nhad called the university to inquire about him. I told him I knew he was a<br/>\nfraud. He hung up on me immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phone numbers used all came up on my Caller-ID as Connecticut phone<br/>\nnumbers. They all appear to be pay phone numbers.  The numbers are:<br/>\n<br/>\n203-255-8116<br/>\n203-222-9987<br/>\n203-261-9844<br/>\n<br/>\nThe security at NYU is currently looking into this situation. As more<br/>\ninformation becomes available, I will pass it on. In the meantime, all<br/>\nhomeschoolers should be aware of this man. He is a fraud.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Karen Hoogland<br/>\n************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kdhoogland5@...\">kdhoogland5@...</a> or <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kdhoogland@...\">kdhoogland@...</a><br/>\nCustom Stained Glass: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3BoyGlassworks.tripod.com\">http://3BoyGlassworks.tripod.com</a><br/>\nScouting for the Homeschooled <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooledscouts.tripod.com\">http://homeschooledscouts.tripod.com</a><br/>\nFamily Site <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Hoagys.tripod.com\">http://Hoagys.tripod.com</a><br/>\nGrassroots Homeschoolers <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://GrassrootsHS.tripod.com\">http://GrassrootsHS.tripod.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23084,"nextTopicId":23116}}
