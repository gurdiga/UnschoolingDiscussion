Each patrol was doing something different and interesting, all in the same room.   That became one of my fantasy ideal situations.   Sometimes at our house it&#39;s that way, with extra people over and three or four different things happening that participants can move betwee.  A week ago there was a Sunday night when some kids were playing Karaoke Revolution, some were playing Donkey Konga in another room, a couple were &quot;building decks&quot; (designing a good deck for a CCG game of some sort) and downstairs two were playing an older SNES game.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the first time it has happened, though it&#39;s usually two or three &quot;stations,&quot; rather than four, but in my own mind, that handbook illustration comes to my mind and I count it a happy success.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had other book illustrations I used to just look at for a moment of happy escape when I was a kid.  Some were full color, full page, really wonderful things.  Some were Victorian woodcuts with medieval themes and I loved those.  But this plain, modern, one- or two-colored girl scout handbook bit was attractive to me beyond any original intent of the artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love it when we can give one of our kids a really good choice, not just &quot;go do something fun or stay home.&quot;  It might be &quot;If you stay home, Renee and Julie are coming over to watch movies, but some of us are going to this or that (music/park/movie/dinner), and often they get to do some of both.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103488,"nextTopicId":103538}}
