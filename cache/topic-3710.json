Just after his second birthday,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1952276626\">A Bulldozer Taught My Two Year Old to Read<br/>\n\tBy Melanie Shimokawa<br/>\n<br/>\nMook, my two year old son, goes through phases of obsession.  Just after<br/>\nhis second birthday, the &quot;thing&quot; was bulldozers, cranes, power shovels,<br/>\ndump trucks, etc.  Every time we would pass by a construction site, he<br/>\nwould go wild, pointing at the various machines and telling everyone in<br/>\nthe world what they were.  So we got him a couple books about heavy<br/>\nmachinery - perhaps a little more advanced than for a two year old, but<br/>\nhe liked the pictures.  Those were his favorite books, and he would ask<br/>\nme or Daddy to read them to him day after day after day, several times a<br/>\nday.  He soon had the books memorized word for word.  He figured out<br/>\njust by looking at some of the words that c-r-a-n-e spelled crane, etc. <br/>\nAside from learning to recognize certain words, he also learned<br/>\neverything there was to know about those machines, except, of course,<br/>\nhow to operate one.  He delighted construction workers with his<br/>\nknowledge of their equipment, and actually got to sit in a power shovel<br/>\nonce.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about three or four months, he got tired of heavy machines.  I<br/>\nguess he figured he had learned everything there was for a two year old<br/>\nto learn about them.  Or maybe his next obsession was more fascinating<br/>\nthan the first.  Trains.  By now, he knew his letters from a computer<br/>\nprogram, and what they sounded like.  So, by the same method, when he<br/>\nlearned to recognize the names of trains, he was able to sound them out,<br/>\nand taught himself to read, not only the words in his book, but words in<br/>\nother places as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months later, dinosaurs took over, and he can always be heard<br/>\nsinging dinosaur songs, or reading dinosaur books.  He still can not<br/>\nread fluently.  That will come with time.  But he built his own<br/>\nfoundation and a love for reading.  Not because he was forced, but<br/>\nbecause he was allowed.  He still doesn*t know what 1+1 is, and I don*t<br/>\ncare to teach him right now.  But his knowledge of heavy machines and<br/>\ntrains is amazing.<br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, and other essays can be found on my incomplete website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/3440/\">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pointe/3440/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else is willing to help me by writing essays on various<br/>\ntopics, I would appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4134,"nextTopicId":4141}}
