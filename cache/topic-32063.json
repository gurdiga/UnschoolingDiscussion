Just like my son is required to<br/>\n&gt;attend homeschool in NY according to state law required hours. I<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t avoid it at home anymore than they can avoid it in their<br/>\n&gt;institution.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The democratic process doesn&#39;t mean that the ones that want to do<br/>\n&gt;workbooks can make the others do it by voting on it. It means that<br/>\n&gt;the budget, the staff (there are no teachers) members are voted in or<br/>\n&gt;out, and other non-cirruculum stuff is voted on. They also use a<br/>\n&gt;judicial committee to handle complaints between students. So in<br/>\n&gt;essence, its the non-coercive parenting type things that are<br/>\n&gt;democratic. The cirriculum is not. Each child is allowed to pursue<br/>\n&gt;their own paths. If a bunch of them get-together because they all<br/>\n&gt;want to learn something like basket-weaving, then they can vote it<br/>\n&gt;into the budget to hire a bonafide basket-weaver to teach them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The age mixing, the ability to have many kinds of adults around of<br/>\n&gt;with differing abilities to help you when you want to pursue<br/>\n&gt;something is, in my opinion, far better than unschooling at home.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;SV has a basic set of principles, then each school develops it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;own &#39;flavour&#39; in addition to the principles that allow them to be<br/>\n&gt;called Sudbury.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;regards,<br/>\n&gt;kolleen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32018,"nextTopicId":32065}}
