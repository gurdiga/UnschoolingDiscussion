THE UPS AND DOWNS OF TRAMPOLINES<br/>\n<br/>\nIn last month&#39;s Neuroscience for Kids newsletter you read about the<br/>\npotential for head injury while playing golf and in a previous newsletter<br/>\nyou may remember an article on soccer-related head injuries.  Other sports<br/>\nand sports equipment also pose risks to our heads and brains.  In fact,<br/>\ntrampoline jumping is one of these risky sports.  Now, I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nsound like your mother or father (&quot;Put on your seatbelt!&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t forget<br/>\nyour bike helmet!&quot;), but protecting your brain is important.  Brain damage<br/>\ncan have devastating consequences and recovery from such injuries can be<br/>\ndifficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a policy statement released in May 1999, the American Academy of<br/>\nPediatrics (AAP) estimated that in 1996 there were 83,400<br/>\ntrampoline-related injuries.  Of these injuries, two-thirds were to<br/>\nchildren between the ages of 5 and 15 years old.  Although injuries to the<br/>\nleg, foot, arm and hand were most common, 14% of the injuries were to the<br/>\nhead or face.  About 15% of all head injuries involved fractures,<br/>\nconcussions and internal head injuries.<br/>\n<br/>\nFatal trampoline injuries are rare.  Nevertheless, six trampoline-related<br/>\ndeaths have been reported since 1990.  Most of these fatalities occurred<br/>\nwhen people fell off of the trampoline and injured the upper part of their<br/>\nspinal cords.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the high risk of injury associated with trampoline use, the AAP<br/>\nhas recommended:<br/>\n<br/>\nA.  &quot;The trampoline should not be used at home, inside or outside.&quot;<br/>\nB.  &quot;The trampoline should not be part of routine physical education<br/>\nclasses in schools.&quot;<br/>\nC.  &quot;The trampoline has no place in outdoor playgrounds and should never<br/>\nbe regarded as play equipment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe full text of the AAP policy statement can be found at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aap.org/policy/re9844.html\">http://www.aap.org/policy/re9844.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand a complete story about trampoline-related injuries can be found on the<br/>\nNeuroscience for Kids pages at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/trampo.html\">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/trampo.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh...and remember to look both ways before crossing the street!<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  EINSTEIN&#39;S BRAIN...BACK IN THE NEWS<br/>\n<br/>\nThe incredible intelligence of physicist Albert Einstein continues to<br/>\ncapture the interest of the public and scientists alike.  On June 19,<br/>\n1999, the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; (vol. 353, pages 2149-2153)<br/>\npublished the latest study concerning Einstein&#39;s brain and the possible<br/>\nconnection with his genius.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers found that compared to normal brains, the brain of<br/>\nEinstein was wider and had a shorter groove on the parietal lobe of the<br/>\ncerebral cortex.  This area of the cerebral cortex is thought to play a<br/>\nrole in mathematical abilities and spatial reasoning.  The researchers<br/>\nthink that the characteristics found on Einstein&#39;s brain permitted better<br/>\nconnections between neurons important for these functions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough these results are interesting, it must be remembered that this<br/>\nstudy had only ONE subject in the experimental group...Albert Einstein. It<br/>\nremains to be seen if other mathematical geniuses also show these<br/>\ndistinguishing brain characteristics.  Moreover, the study did not<br/>\ninvestigate the brain at a microscopic level.  In other words, they did<br/>\nnot look to see if there were differences in how neurons were connected<br/>\nand of course, could not tell if there were differences in the way the<br/>\nneurons functioned.  Further research using modern brain imaging<br/>\ntechniques (MRI/PET) that look at the anatomy and function of the brain in<br/>\nliving geniuses may help solve some of these questions.

BOOK REVIEW<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Phantoms in the Brain : Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind&quot; by V. S.<br/>\nRamachandran and Sandra Blakeslee, New York, William Morrow & Company,<br/>\n1998, 320 pages.<br/>\n<br/>\n[This book review was written by Ira Surolia, second-year medical student,<br/>\nB.R. Ambedkar Medical College, Bangalore, India]<br/>\n<br/>\nRamachandran, a neurologist from the University of California, San Diego,<br/>\nhas written a highly readable book about the human brain.  In my opinion,<br/>\n&quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; is most appropriate for high school students and<br/>\nadults who are not experts in neurology.  The book, written in a clear,<br/>\nstory-like style, starts with an introduction to the brain and continues<br/>\nwith stories of people who have unusual neurological conditions. These<br/>\nconditions include phantom limbs (people feel the presence of a body part<br/>\nthat has been amputated), false pregnancies (women feel sure they are<br/>\npreganant when they are not), scotomas (people are blind only in parts of<br/>\ntheir visual field), neglect (people ignore parts of their bodies), denial<br/>\n(people refuse to believe something is wrong with them), and epilepsy<br/>\n(people have seizures).<br/>\n<br/>\nRamachandran starts each chapter with the description of a particular<br/>\nproblem, then follows with ideas about the underlying cause of the<br/>\ndisorder.  These theories are then supported or thrown out, depending on<br/>\nthe evidence that doctors find when examining the patients or by doing<br/>\nexperiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the book, readers are treated to Ramachandran&#39;s clever ways of<br/>\nthinking about neurology, including:<br/>\n<br/>\nA. You don&#39;t always need expensive or state-of-the-art equipment to make<br/>\nimportant discoveries.  Rather, keen observation and questioning of<br/>\npatients often help to solve some neurological puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. If you study the normal functioning of the brain and then figure out<br/>\nwhat can happen if this is interrupted, you will see how neurological<br/>\ndisorders come about.  For example, in a chapter called &quot;Knowing Where To<br/>\nScratch,&quot; Ramachandran suggests an explanation for pain or sensation in<br/>\narms and legs that have been amputated (&quot;phantom limbs&quot;).  He describes<br/>\nhow changes in the normal structure and nerve connections in the cerebral<br/>\ncortex could cause such sensations.  In a chapter called &quot;God and The<br/>\nLimbic System,&quot; he discusses how some people with epilepsy become overly<br/>\ninvolved in religion. This may be explained by neurological problems in<br/>\nthe temporal lobe, which is involved in emotions and is often damaged or<br/>\nabnormal in people with epilepsy.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n6.
