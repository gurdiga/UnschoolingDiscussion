I<br/>\nsuppose that 4-H varies a lot depending on the leader, but their stuff looks<br/>\npretty schoolish to me.  Not that people can&#39;t do schoolish things as part<br/>\nof unschooling.  But if the parent sees 4-H as a way to get their kids to<br/>\naccomplish something, it really wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have erred with telling my kids about classes and getting them signed up<br/>\nand haven&#39;t always had positive results.<br/>\nI think that a child old enough to benefit from classes would probably<br/>\neither know about their existence or would somehow be asking for help to<br/>\nlearn something.  I don&#39;t think the parent would NEED to tell the kid that<br/>\nthere are classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to bite my tongue the other day when Jackie was playing drums with one<br/>\nreal drum and two overturned buckets.  I wanted to say &quot;You could take a<br/>\ndrum class.&quot;.  I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t.  She KNOWS there are classes for all<br/>\nkinds of stuff.  She knows her cousin takes drum class and has required<br/>\npractice time.  I&#39;m certain that if she ever wants drum lessons she will let<br/>\nme know.  For now, she just wants to play her drums when she feels like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also important to give a child an out if they sign up for a class and<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it.
