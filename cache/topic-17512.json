We&#39;re vegetarians for many different reasons. I guess the<br>first and \n    foremost would be for the earth&#39;s sake. The amount of water,<br>energy, \n    chemicals, land abuse, etc. needed to sustain production of meat<br>animals \n    is horrific on the environment. Secondly would be health reasons, we<br>eat \n    organic produce or stuff we grow ourselves, I don&#39;t want to be \n    putting<br>meat into our bodies that has hormones, fertilizers, pesticides, \n    etc. in it,<br>and also I feel that meat doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to my body on \n    a cellular<br>level (I&#39;ve been a veggie for going on 20 years now, it was \n    when I started<br>exercising and came to a better awareness of my body that \n    I first felt how<br>wrong it felt for my own body to eat meat). Thirdly \n    would be animal-loving<br>reasons as the way most meat animals are raised \n    and slaughtered is pretty<br>inhumane. But I&#39;m not totally against eating \n    meat for this reason - if it<br>was like my ancestors where it was myself, a \n    deer , and an arrow, I&#39;d most<br>likely shoot the deer. After all, the \n    mountain lion would be doing the same<br>thing, nature is in itself fairly \n    cruel to animals across the board. But<br>modern methods go above and beyond \n    in the cruelty department and so I don&#39;t<br>like to support \n    them.<br><br>That brings us to the aquarium. This is an issue I&#39;ve gone back \n    and forth on<br>for many years. Do I go to zoos, circuses, wild animal \n    parks, or not? On one<br>hand, they are keeping animals in cages which feels \n    wrong to me. On the<br>other hand, zoos, aquariums, etc. have come a long \n    way since the day of the<br>bear in the concrete cage staring out through \n    the bars. Nowadays most zoos<br>are into wildlife research, reproduction, \n    animal-trading with other zoos to<br>breed species whose decline in the wild \n    is bordering on extinction, etc. And<br>they also play a big role in \n    educating the public about the dangers to our<br>earth&#39;s wild areas. So does \n    the good they do balance out the bad? Or does<br>the bad of keeping wild \n    animals caged outweigh the good of perhaps saving<br>the whole species? \n    Would panda bears be extinct now if people didn&#39;t see how<br>magical they \n    are up close and therefore send money, time, and energy to<br>organizations \n    to keep their remaining habitat safe? The Oregon Coast<br>Aquarium, where we \n    went, has some measure of fame because of their efforts<br>to rehabilitate \n    Keiko (the orca from &quot;Free Willy&quot;) and return him to the<br>wild. Is \n    supporting this a good thing? Right now, we do go to the aquarium,<br>and to \n    the zoo. We don&#39;t go to the circus because I feel that it doesn&#39;t<br>have \n    any redeeming qualities, the animals are only there for entertainment<br>and \n    no research or educational benefit is present.<br><br>A long-winded reply to \n    a question that for me doesn&#39;t have an absolute<br>answer.<br><br>Blue \n    Skies!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Robin-<br>Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I told you I \n    was going to grow up to be a<br>weirdo&quot;<br>and Asa (10/5/99) Who says &quot;Fishy \n    swim!&quot; at the aquarium, her favorite place<br>in the world<br><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    Flying Clevenger Family<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message boards, timely \n    articles, a free newsletter and more!<br>Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br><br>Addresses:<br>Post \n    message: Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com<br>Unsubscribe: \n    Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br>List owner: \n    Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com<br>List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br></tt><br><br><tt>Your \n    use of Yahoo!
