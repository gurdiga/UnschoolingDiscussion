I forgot to mention that we don&#39;t have very \nmany children in our neighborhood.&nbsp; (that was the topic, afterall)&nbsp; We \nhave friends come over and visit..I was lucky to find the only other kid on my \nstreet..is also homeschooled, so that&#39;s a plus..the meetings for the \nTPA(Teaching Parents Association)&nbsp; are pleasant to attend and mingle with \nthe parents &amp; kids...they are usuallly at the park or a library, but \nhonestly we don&#39;t go that often.&nbsp; Most of my friends kids are in public \nschool, but one family is like an extended family to us, and we visit them \nfrequently, as they do us...they are all older than my son, but the relationship \n&amp; interaction he has with them are great.&nbsp; I don&#39;t subscribe to the \nsocialization thing.....I think todays society is rather OVER \nSOCIALIZED.....before young minds have strength &amp; belief in themselves, they \nare influenced on who to become by others..always comparing themselves to \neveryone else, when there really is no true COmparison.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to have \nother kids over, this weekend we have our friend Nick over, and Zain loves \nplaying all weekend with his friend.....it isn&#39;t very often he seems deprived of \nother childrens presence, when it begins to feel that way , we just go visit \nsomeone, or have someone come visit us...but it&#39;s not mandatory, or \nconstant.&nbsp; We&#39;re lucky to have the couple of good friends we do have, and \nthey are like family, and Zain is well integrated with social situations, \ndespite not being around other kids constantly.&nbsp; Everything in moderation, \nI think..and it works, well.&nbsp; As long as the experiences we all share are \nfull of Life, Love, Fun &amp; Quality.......that is all we need.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Michelle, Dana &amp; Zain Harper<br>The Great \nNorthWest Washington<br>Legendary Tree &amp; \nLandscape<br></font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13062,"nextTopicId":13065}}
