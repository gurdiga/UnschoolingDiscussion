I&#39;m new to unschooling but thought I would throw in my experience with my <br/>\nson regarding math. My son Jordan (9 1/2) was not interested in <br/>\nmultiplication at all. He had been walking around with a calculator for days <br/>\nthen Saturday he walks in the house and says &quot;Mom, ask me these flash cards.&quot; <br/>\nGuess what, they were division flash cards. And he got over 50% of them <br/>\nright!! He was so thrilled. Can you believe it, he learned multiplication by <br/>\nlearning division? I had never heard of it. I guess it was easier to learn <br/>\nboth together. I don&#39;t know, but he now knows most of his multiplication and <br/>\ndivision facts. They truly do learn in &quot;their own way.&quot; Good luck with <br/>\nunschooling!<br/>\nLisa H.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7722,"nextTopicId":7728}}
