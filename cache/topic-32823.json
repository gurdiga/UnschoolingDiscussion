I felt obligated to teach him what he was &quot;supposed&quot; to know, and<br/>\nwhen he didn&#39;t learn I felt it was my fault. Still, it seemed like when<br/>\nwe were traveling or when I was ill my son learned more than when I had<br/>\n&quot;my act together&quot;. It seemed to me that children learned things the same<br/>\nway they learned to talk, on their own, when they were ready, and when<br/>\nthey had a good reason to. I had almost nothing to do with it. I kept<br/>\nlooking for information to show me what was going on. In the homeschool<br/>\nsection of the library I noticed a book whose cover I had been looking at<br/>\nfor years, but since I had no teens I hadn&#39;t read it.   (Grace<br/>\nLlewellyn&#39;s book, The Teenage Liberation Handbook). After hearing the<br/>\nword unschooling in that book, I looked it up on the net and found this<br/>\ngroup. I&#39;ve also found books at the library and searched the net for<br/>\ninformation that is helpful. One book that made a big impact was How To<br/>\nTalk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.<br/>\nNot being controlling doesn&#39;t mean being out of control. <br/>\nIt means: <br/>\nbeing free to be me and to feel and to think as I want without blaming<br/>\nothers;<br/>\nletting others be and feel and think as they do without me feeling<br/>\nresponsible; <br/>\nleading by gentleness and example rather than by harshness and coercion ;<br/>\nspeaking my mind without accusation or name calling; <br/>\nsearching for and learning new ways to live with others; <br/>\nlistening instead of demanding immediate compliance; <br/>\ncooperating instead of commanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59432230,"authorName":"joanna514","from":"&quot;joanna514&quot; &lt;Wilkinson6@...&gt;","profile":"joanna514","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Stepford mom","postDate":"1016720770","msgId":33024,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE3Y3FpMis4MTRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwMzIxMTQxNDUwLjg0ODk0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33023,"nextInTopic":33055,"prevInTime":33023,"nextInTime":33025,"topicId":32823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and overly tolerant was interesting to find, and I am still finding it. ... suggestions, or any other suggestions?
