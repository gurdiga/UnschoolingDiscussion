Before school started our home and<br/>\nthe neighbors where often the center on children coming to visit.  Once<br/>\nschool started no one comes over.  I wasn&#39;t impressed with most of the<br/>\nchildren.  The next door neighbor girl who is 8 gets along well with my<br/>\nson and both sets of parents like knowing where our children are, which<br/>\nhouse and such. Another neighbor recently moved in two houses down that<br/>\nhas a 7 year old boy that we&#39;ve had over, which may be helpful.   Most<br/>\nof the other parents just want to make sure their children are within a<br/>\ntwo block radius.   Unfortunately when you get more than two children<br/>\nparticularly schooled children they  start to only want to play with<br/>\nkids near their age or gender.  My son has friends of many ages and<br/>\ngenders.  My son doesn&#39;t always react in ways they&#39;d expect, he&#39;s<br/>\nsomewhat high energy and physical.  It&#39;s been helpful that he has a pet<br/>\nturtle and this gives others something to relate to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince school started and the other kids are gone it&#39;s been difficult and<br/>\nhe says he misses the kids.  I have a hard time not letting him wander<br/>\nand he sometimes goes farther that I find acceptable.  It&#39;s fortunate<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t have much traffic on our streets.  I know he can handle<br/>\nhimself it&#39;s the other kids I worry about.  We do schedule daily outings<br/>\n(this helps both of us).  We are doing weekly outings with another<br/>\nhomeschooling family, nature walks and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s tricky unschooling an only child at times.  Does anyone else have<br/>\nan only child they are unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13069,"nextTopicId":13075}}
