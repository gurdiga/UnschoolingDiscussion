In conversations about learning languages with them, many <br/>\n(but not all) have told me that English is one of the harder languages to <br/>\nlearn precisely because of that *small percentage* of irregular words and <br/>\nrules for sounds. The foreign exchange student staying with my folks two <br/>\nyears ago stated she had an easier time learning Japanese than English.
