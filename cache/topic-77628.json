Just put the <br/>\noriginal somewhere safe.  County landfill,  under the couch...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut IF someone wants proof of your registration, show them the copies with <br/>\nthe date.  Say, &quot;Look, I have copies.  Do you want one?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can send a copy to the state later if they say &quot;We don&#39;t have your <br/>\nregistration.&quot;<br/>\nYou say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.

After I read al the rules on a notice of Intent and testing I just ignored it. We managed 18 months before someone turned me in. That was at Xmas 2002. The state sent me all their stuff so I sent it back written in Welsh. No word from them for months then they write claiming they&#39;ve heard nothing. I called them up to clarify a few points of th law but so far have done nothing and not hearda peep out of them. I&#39;m hoping that this state of affairs will continue until we leave the country at Xmas. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m testing my kids.<br/>\nIf we were staying I would purchase the tests and do &#39;em myself This way I&#39;m happy cos my kids are not tested, the state is happy cos they have a piece of paper with some numbers on. I don&#39;t consider it cheating personally (although some people on another list accused me of being spawn from hell for suggesting the idea...) cos I&#39;m not claiming anything for my children. The point is that bits of paper move roound and everyone is happy. It&#39;s not like in 15 years time people wil give a stuff about supposed scores in Grade 2 or whatever.<br/>\nAnyway, personally I&#39;d just stay underground and on the offchance someone snitches on you, then claim ignorance. But thats just me. I resent laws that tell me what the state thinks I should be doing with my own children. &lt;cue land of the free rant, what would the founding fathers think etc etc&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n:-)<br/>\n <br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n <br/>\nPS.
