Or paint them<br/>\ndirectly on the walls...I don&#39;t know how crazy free you feel about<br/>\nthat. LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nRent a whole series of movies, like all of the Star Wars movies or the<br/>\nLord of the Rings, or every episode of Star Trek Classic or all the<br/>\nVeggieTales, and have a marathon complete with nachos and popcorn.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvite each person&#39;s best friend (including YOURS) over for a slumber<br/>\nparty.  Make homemade pizzas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely No Housework except the bare minimum to survive...fix meals<br/>\nand snacks, wash dishes (but use a lot of paper to throw away too),<br/>\nwash only underwear, pick up the toys a bit when the baby is tripping<br/>\nover them.

I have posted only a couple of times,but I <br/>\nfollow you guys faithfully every day.<br/>\nI am having problems coping with everything right now and could use <br/>\nsome advice.<br/>\nMy four boys(9, 6, 3, and 1) are driving me crazy!!!<br/>\nI am practically a single mom. My husband works offshore for 2 weeks <br/>\nand is home 2 weeks out of the month. I handle everything from house <br/>\ncleaning to paying bills etc. None of my boys have attended school <br/>\nexcept my oldest from 5 to 6 and then I took him out.<br/>\nMy problem is that I have been unschooling for well over a year now <br/>\nand while I DO see them learning everyday.And am very proud of there <br/>\nacomplishments, i do have a problem with them not wanting to do <br/>\nanything but watch TV and fight with each other.<br/>\nI do expect a little help.I am so busy doing housework,cooking giving <br/>\nthe little ones what they need,and such, that I don&#39;t feel I am <br/>\nspending enough time WITH them.<br/>\nMy two older ones are always screaming and fighting.The don&#39;t do <br/>\nthere simple chores when I ask and I just don&#39;t know what to do <br/>\nanymore.<br/>\nI would like more time WITH them,not just taking care of the daily <br/>\nchores. I have no one to help babysit or anything like that while my <br/>\nhusband is gone so I can get more done.<br/>\nI can&#39;t even go to the bathroom without having somone beat on my door <br/>\nor someone screaming for me. I would like to have ocational time to <br/>\nbe myself on top of all this too.<br/>\nIf anyone has any advice on what I need to change abut this, Please <br/>\nhelp me out, I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n                                         Tonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111377,"nextTopicId":111418}}
