It didn&#39;t stop me from<br/>\nconceiving very good.  ;)  The pill is also designed to change the<br/>\nlining of the uterus so that if conception should occur, the baby<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t implant on the uterus a week later like it was supposed<br/>\nto and would just starve as the yolk sac was used up.  That aspect<br/>\nof the pill failed for me too thankfully and I have a child to<br/>\nshow for it.  :)<br/>\nHad I known that my uterus lining was chemically changed to not<br/>\nallow a pregnancy to implant if the first job of the pill failed,<br/>\nI would never have taken the pills.  It would go against my<br/>\npersonal beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n<br/>\nKandice<br/>\nWe will PAY you $500-$800+ mo. to stop POISONING your kids!  ;)  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kandyc@...\">kandyc@...</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\nFREE!
