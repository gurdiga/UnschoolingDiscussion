[OE. boras, fr. F. borax, earlier spelt borras; cf. LL. <br/>\nborax, Sp. borraj; all fr. Ar. b?rag, fr. Pers. b?rah.] A white or gray <br/>\ncrystalline salt, with a slight alkaline taste, used as a flux, in soldering <br/>\nmetals, making enamels, fixing colors on porcelain, and as a soap. It occurs <br/>\nnative in certain mineral springs, and is made from the boric acid of hot <br/>\nsprings in Tuscany.
