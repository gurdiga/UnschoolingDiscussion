He loves holding a map and giving directions. He&#39;s still has a hand<br/>\ndrawn treasure map, colored on his placemat at a restaurant three weeks ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even an outdated globe can be fun to pull out and look at given the right<br/>\ncontext. No, it&#39;s not about the globe itself, but more about having fun<br/>\nstuff and finding fun stuff that you can pull out at the right time.

The world is our &quot;text&quot; book!<br/>\n<br/>\nLetterboxing is a great way to get the kids excited about going outside and<br/>\nhiking, Michele. You can find out more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.letterboxing.org\">http://www.letterboxing.org</a> and<br/>\nyou can see our stamp if you follow the Letterboxing link from my webpage<br/>\nbelow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLboxing is kind of a scavenger hunt/ hike/ outing. It gives a reason to go<br/>\nsomewhere new, and a goal for the hike, which in my experience makes all the<br/>\ndifference with kids. We were out hiking the other day, without letterboxing<br/>\nand the kids flagged about 15 minutes in--they&#39;re 7, 5 and 4. For a lbox,<br/>\nthey can hike about 2 or 3 miles--just to put it in perspective. It&#39;s a lot<br/>\nof fun, and it&#39;s great to do as a diversion on long trips. You can find some<br/>\nboxes on the way and take some time out of the car. Once the kids get older,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll probably graduate to geocaching, which is similar but with a GPS and<br/>\nsouveneirs. It sounds like great fun, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also rock climb, which gets the kids outdoors a lot. We go climbing<br/>\npretty much every weekend as a family. We also built a climbing wall off the<br/>\nkids&#39; climber, and we&#39;ll all play around on that several times a week. My<br/>\nyoungest--4 and only son--probably plays on it the least, for what it&#39;s<br/>\nworth. He&#39;s pretty happy to be inside playing his new Scooby-Doo game or<br/>\nsome other computer game. Dh and youngest dd (5) probably use it the most,<br/>\nand it&#39;s been some really great bonding time for them. I climb during the<br/>\nweek some, but I&#39;m mostly outside putzing with my gardens or my chickens.<br/>\nThe kids like coming in and out at their liesure. They help some, get bored<br/>\nor hot and go back in. They also play outside with neighbors a lot--it&#39;s<br/>\nalways more fun with extra kids. They like feeding the fish or trying to<br/>\ncatch frogs in the pond. We&#39;ve got lots of fun stuff outside--and lots of<br/>\nfun stuff inside. They&#39;re pretty much free to choose whatever, except when<br/>\nthey&#39;re totally bouncing off the walls and I &quot;suggest&quot; we all go out for a<br/>\ngame.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"Crystal","from":"&quot;Crystal&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: wanting some unschooling support","postDate":"1091642928","msgId":97283,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlcjhuZythbTV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNzEwMWM0Nzg0OCQ5ZTE1NzAwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBybWJ3YzE+"},"prevInTopic":97273,"nextInTopic":97289,"prevInTime":97282,"nextInTime":97284,"topicId":97255,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***What if the draw towards the video games is in part because of nothing better to do?**** What if they don t want anything more to do than just sit and play ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-538552567\">***What if the draw towards the video games is in part because of <br/>\nnothing better to do?****<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if they don&#39;t want anything more to do than just sit and play <br/>\nvideo games.

Spiritual.  That kind of thing.  I <br/>\nguess I was looking for other people that too enjoy getting outside, <br/>\nbut don&#39;t get the same enthusiasm from their kids.  But your <br/>\ndescription of the &quot;should&quot; part of the getting outside equation is <br/>\nalso a part of it, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve received feedback from the list about how great video games are, <br/>\nand I&#39;m not thinking that this is my concern right now.  My concerns <br/>\nare not so much about video games (I&#39;ve truly seen many benefits tied <br/>\nto making their own decisions, whether it&#39;s video games or not), but <br/>\nabout making sure that there are enough other enticing opportunities <br/>\nin case they&#39;re interested, as well as meeting my own needs for <br/>\noutdoor time.  I really appreciated your ideas about parks, puppet <br/>\nshows, etc.  We do that, but not as much as I&#39;d like, I guess.  It&#39;s <br/>\nthe rest of the time that they...make their own decisions about stuff <br/>\nwhile we&#39;re hanging out at home.  Which is great.  But then I&#39;m back <br/>\nto whether or not we have enough to do around the house for them.  If <br/>\nI&#39;m not interacting with them (or even if I am) then my son is <br/>\nplaying video games. And I do play with them, but of course, not all <br/>\nthe time. I&#39;m not so concerned about my daughter - she reads, plays <br/>\nBarbies, nurtures her guinea pig, writes stories, watches the <br/>\noccasional movie, does all sorts of things that I can appreciate.  I <br/>\nguess it&#39;s also because I don&#39;t often see my son enjoying anything <br/>\nelse but the video games.  Again, not about the video games, per se, <br/>\nbut wanting to make sure I&#39;ve got enough around here, in case he&#39;s <br/>\ninterested.  I remember a thread a while back about quilting shows, <br/>\nand the suggestion was that a 9 year old boy would not like them, <br/>\nlikely, so do things more age/gender appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, what other things have people on this list offered <br/>\n(toys,activities) for active 6 year old boys who love woodworkiing, <br/>\nsports (he&#39;s extremely athletic and capable), beyblades?  Kind of <br/>\ninto crafts, but not so much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] wanting some unschooling support","postDate":"1091627397","msgId":97289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEMzY2MUM1LjI5ODREJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0LjJmZTQ4NjZkLjJlNDIyZmE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97283,"nextInTopic":97290,"prevInTime":97288,"nextInTime":97290,"topicId":97255,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
