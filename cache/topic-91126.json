It&#39;s manipulative, prescriptive and incredibly mysogenistic. If you feel like slogging through it go ahead; it&#39;s rather eye opening. Instead, _Emile_ serves as the foundation of liberal education--the kind we see in public schools and universities all across the US. The whole purpose is to educate Emile into a true citizen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely *NOT* unschooling! Sandra, yes.
