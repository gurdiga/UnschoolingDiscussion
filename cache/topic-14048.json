LOL) to suggest an idea for you.<br/>\nMy son is also very interested in video games. Why not research with him on<br/>\nhow they are designed and ask him to design a game. You never know what<br/>\ncould happen from there. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie E.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   &gt;Anyway, my one problem with Jimmie is that he is totally <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; addicted to video games.  We have a Nintendo that has been used in<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; moderation, but if I left it up to Jimmie, the Nintendo would be<br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;24 hours a day.  When we go anywhere in the car, he&#39;s got his Game <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;Boy with him, so this is something we battle every waking hour.<br/>\n&gt; How <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;do I teach him some moderation without insulting his choices?  I <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;have to admit, I have wanted to say, &quot;Turn that silly box OFF and<br/>\n&gt; do <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;something that involves a BRAIN!!!&quot;  I have restrained myself so <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;far, but I could snap at any minute.  How would the rest of you <br/>\n&gt;  &gt;handle this?<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Carol<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14042,"nextTopicId":14016}}
