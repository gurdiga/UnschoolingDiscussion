I have been horrified to find out<br/>\nhow the animals are treated.  Goats are browsers, enjoying leaves, bark, all<br/>\nkinds of weeds and grains.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to &quot;win&quot; at the shows, the kids are encouraged to only feed their<br/>\ngoats concentrated pellets, nothing else, which give the animals &quot;grain<br/>\noverload&quot; and must be vaccinated against.  Animals are kept in small pens so<br/>\nintestinal worm overload becomes a problem so in with another chemical to<br/>\nkill the worms.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo build muscle, the goats are placed on a track and chased by a dog or a<br/>\nperson on a four-wheeler.  I was sick about it but glad to know that dd<br/>\nwould rather not win than to purposefully terrify her animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe raise our animals as holistically as possible.  We don&#39;t always win but<br/>\nat least I can look at myself in the mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40126,"nextTopicId":40151}}
