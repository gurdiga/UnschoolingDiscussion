We are kids, and we ware <br/>\nfed up with the way that we and our peers are treated. Young people <br/>\nare capable of playing a vital role in our communities. Throughout <br/>\ntime, we have participated in progressive political action. However,<br/>\nadults often overlook our potential and fail to support us. Parents, <br/>\nteachers and other adults in our lives ignore and marginalize our <br/>\nviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE WANT OUR VOICES BACK!<br/>\nWe are locked up for seven or more hours a day, for at least 13 <br/>\nyears. We are forced to &quot;learn&quot; things that aren&#39;t useful or <br/>\napplicable to our lives and that often aren&#39;t even true. We are <br/>\ntaught to obey, to keep our opinions to ourselves and to remain <br/>\nsilent. We are groomed to enter the workforce. We targeted by<br/>\ncorporations that prey on us as lucrative customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE WANT OUR MINDS BACK!<br/>\nWe are punished for pursuing our dreams. We are raised and <br/>\nindoctrinated into a culture of racism, sexism, ageism and violence. <br/>\nWe are forbidden from being in public during certain hours of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE WANT OUR FUN BACK!<br/>\nWe are taught not to question or challenge our own oppression or that <br/>\nof others. We learn onlyn how to operate within and perpetuate <br/>\nauthoritative relationships. We want to escape these destructive <br/>\nenvironments.<br/>\n<br/>\nWE WANT OUR LIVES BACK!<br/>\nFor all of these reasons, we are organizing Celebrate Youth!: A <br/>\nConference onLiberation, a three-day gathering in scheduled for Feb. <br/>\n15-17 in St. Petersburg,Florida. The conference will incorporate <br/>\nserious discussion, analyses of the problems facing youth today and <br/>\nconstructive workshops that equip us with the tools we need to <br/>\ndismantle these oppressive systems in favor of a healthier<br/>\napproach to learning and living. Of course, we will also have fun with<br/>\nactivities such as games, movies, picnics, a concert, free-form <br/>\nperformances andbike rides through the city. Through this conference, <br/>\nwe hope to empower youth and adults from a variety of communities and <br/>\ndiverse backgrounds to begin building a society based on freedom and <br/>\nrespect, rather than oppression and domination.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW CAN YOU HELP?<br/>\nWe are looking for people to speak at the conference, facilitate <br/>\nworkshops, donate money and resources and spread the word of the <br/>\nconference in their communities. Please get in touch to let us know <br/>\nwhat you can do to help.
