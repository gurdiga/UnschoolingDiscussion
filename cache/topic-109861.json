I suggest the moms talk to each other, discuss the possibilities and how they would want to handle it rather than bringing social issues with girl/boy play to the kids.

I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-369310217\">Geneva, <br/>\n<br/>\nI say pat yourself on the back for fostering what sounds like a wonderful,<br/>\nhealthy, realistic friendship and roleplay between two 5 year olds.   I<br/>\nunderstand your feelings of discomfort however, as I recall the years my<br/>\nkids did the same thing with their best friends.  I think observation is<br/>\neverything.  As a mom, you watch your kids, listen to them and are ready to<br/>\ninvolve yourself in their lives as a knowledgeable parent whenever they need<br/>\nyou to.  When something seems confusing or amiss, you find a way to talk to<br/>\nthem about it - not in an admonishing way, but in a way that helps you<br/>\nunderstand what they are thinking and what their plans are.  You can help<br/>\nguide their thinking and behavior with your questions and suggestions.  Be<br/>\nconscious about whether your concerns are fear-based (not good) or rational.<br/>\nI also recommend talking to the other mom involved (I think you already<br/>\nare?) so she knows what the kids are up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most meaningful experiences I&#39;ve ever had was in attending a<br/>\nweekend seminar with Ashley Montague (now deceased) who is a British<br/>\nanthropologist.  He&#39;s written many wonderful works and has traveled and<br/>\nstudied cultures worldwide extensively.  One of the things he talked about<br/>\nwas how important it is to the development of healthy behaviors in adults<br/>\nfor them as children to observe the behavior of adults and to freely mimic<br/>\nbehaviors through roleplaying.  He was adamant that no good behavior could<br/>\nbe learned from a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause this list seems to love controversy and shock quality information,<br/>\nMontague was also adamant that children observe their parents having sex.<br/>\nHe claimed that in other cultures where parents are unafraid of their<br/>\nchildren seeing them during sexual activity, and children are free to share<br/>\na family bed, walk into a room where parents are having sex, etc. that such<br/>\nchildren grow up without the need to experiment with sex prematurely and<br/>\nthey have healthy sexual relationship(s) as adults.  This was shocking,<br/>\nmonstrous news for me years ago when my kids were babies/toddlers, but I<br/>\nheard it at the right time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a responsible parent needs to dissect and evaluate the roots of<br/>\nanger, depression, dysfunction and rethink what is necessary to grow a child<br/>\nthat is comfortable and thriving in her own space, free to state her<br/>\nopinion, disagree and act in accordance with her own inclinations, etc.  It<br/>\ncan be real challenging trying to overcome all that our culture feeds us<br/>\nwith regard to what our kids need, what we need.  The wonderful thing about<br/>\nbeing an unschooler is that we already have so much practice thinking for<br/>\nourselves and bucking traditional &quot;wisdom&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barb.lundgren@...\">barb.lundgren@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it.

We came to unschooling about a yr and a half<br/>\nago and that has led us closer to TCS and radical unschooling.  I recognize<br/>\nthat it is a journey and dh and I have lots to learn but more than anything<br/>\nI want/try to be respectful, patient and understanding.  Now for my dilemma<br/>\n- Echo has a friend Aanaleese, she is 5.5 and homeschooled in a very relaxed<br/>\nway, her mom and I have been friends for about a year and I consider her<br/>\nvery dear and I see our friendship as a very important one that I want to<br/>\nnurture and grow old with - I hope that makes sense.  I have lots of<br/>\ngirlfriends but I see her and her family as special.<br/>\n<br/>\nAanaleese and Echo play together about once per week, sometimes more.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past couple of mos, when she visits they play &quot;family&quot;, where Echo is<br/>\nthe dad, Aanaleese is the mom and my 2 yo daughter is either the gma or more<br/>\nrecently the daughter.  Echo and Aanaleese are very loving and nurturing to<br/>\ntheir &quot;daughter&quot; and honestly I have teared up over some of the sweet<br/>\nsituations that have come up in their &quot;parenting&quot; of their &quot;daughter&quot;.  I<br/>\ncan go into more detail as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is this.Echo has never expressed any type of romantic feelings<br/>\nor play with any other kids so this is all very new for me.  I have noticed<br/>\nlately that lately when they play &quot;family&quot; Aanaleese always likes to bring<br/>\nthe role playing into bedtime.where the mom and dad are going to bed.  So<br/>\nthis basically means 2 5 yo  going to bed in the middle of the day.  What do<br/>\nthey do - they lie in bed.  There has been talk of &quot;would you like to take<br/>\nyour wedding ring off and put it on the table with mine&quot; etc.  It&#39;s all very<br/>\ninnocent and sweet and I feel proud that they both have loving relationships<br/>\nto model.  Dh and I are very affectionate and always have been without<br/>\nfeeling shameful or as if we should not kiss/hug in front of the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I am happy to divuldge any info to help you understand the goings on<br/>\nwithout typing it all out now.  I&#39;m just wondering in a nut shell if this<br/>\nall sounds okay and if you would be comfortable with all of this.  In my<br/>\nheart I am okay with it but not sure &quot;how&quot; to handle it or if I should<br/>\n&quot;handle&quot; anything in th e first place.  We have a 2 story house where the<br/>\nkids have 2 bedrooms and a bath upstairs.  When my kids are home without<br/>\nfriends over, they choose to be downstairs with me ut when they have<br/>\nAanaleese over, they choose to be upstairs.I do pop in and visit with them,<br/>\nI also invite them down to do other things with me but when Aanaleese is<br/>\nover they are almost always in character it seems.  There are 3 beds<br/>\nupstairs as well as a pretend kitchen, living area, dinette, dress up box<br/>\netc.so that is the &#39;family&#39;s&quot; homestead and when I try to involve myself<br/>\nthey obviously do not want/need me there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday.the kids came down for a snack and while I was preparing it, I<br/>\npeeked into the living room to see Echo and Aanaleese in eachother&#39;s arms.<br/>\nWell ithought it was very sweet but at the same time (was it MY upbringing<br/>\nthat triggered these feelings?) it did make me a tad uncomfortable.  Again,<br/>\nit was very innocent and loving looking.Echo says she is his best friend<br/>\never and he loves her very much OR do I need to have a talk with my son.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am just a bit confused.are they too young?  My parents shamed me<br/>\nfor this sort of thing and I don&#39;t want to make them feel shameful - they<br/>\nreally do love eachother, but they are 5!!!!  Gotta go now but I look<br/>\nforward to some feed back and hearing what you all would do/ have done in<br/>\nthis situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGeneva Goza<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal Chef Services<br/>\n<br/>\n214-660-0231<br/>\n<br/>\n214-663-0141 cell<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gozas@...\">gozas@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109824,"nextTopicId":19391}}
