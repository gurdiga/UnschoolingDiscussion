It breaks my heart when I see people ready to  give up <br/>\nand send their kids back to school, because they can&#39;t get their kids to  do <br/>\nthe work, or the kid is miserable, or all they do is fight.  The first  words <br/>\nout of my mouth are &quot;take a break for a while.&quot;  Then we talk about  just having <br/>\nfun, or reading stories together, or baking, or going for a  walk.  But <br/>\nespecially asking the kids what THEY want to do.  Finding  out whey THEY&#39;RE <br/>\ninterested in.

Most of the people are <br/>\nmoms who want to stay home with their kids, and I just love helping them to <br/>\nbe able to reach those goals. Quite a few of these women then decide to <br/>\nhomeschool their kids. One of my business partners who had put her business <br/>\non hold for about 3 years just got in touch with me a couple of days ago to <br/>\nlet me know she wished to start up again. She also let me know that she is <br/>\nnow homeschooling her kids (dd8, ds6, & dd3). We talked briefly yesterday <br/>\nand she sent me an email today. I lifted a paragraph from that email;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;After talking to you last night and you made the comment of not having the <br/>\nkids do work books that they hate. It made so much sense when you related <br/>\nit to toxins.  This morning I surprised Alexia (dd8) when I had her pick up <br/>\nher language book and hand it to me.  I then said &quot;Do you like this? Me <br/>\neither&quot; and threw it over my shoulder.  I then did the same with her <br/>\nmonotonous spelling workbook.  She was so happy and laughed and <br/>\nlaughed.  She is having problems with her spelling and phonics, but yet can <br/>\nread very well.  I will figure something out for helping her with her <br/>\nphonics and spelling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just made me so happy to help another child to have a more positive <br/>\nhomeschooling experience. I wish I could instantly turn them all into happy <br/>\nunschoolers, but I will have to try to keep from preaching too much and <br/>\njust keep working on them little by little.
