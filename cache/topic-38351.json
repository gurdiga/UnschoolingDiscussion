I have a friend that &quot;does it&quot; and her kids are always doing the most interesting things and I just don&#39;t know how to &quot;make&quot; my kids have more interests.  If I let them be, they just play barbies all the time.  (they are girls 9 and 7).  BUT after taking a couple months off at<br/>\n &quot;school&quot; as my friend suggested. They finally stopped playing barbies once I got K&#39;nex out.  They started building kits from the book for about a week then started making up their own models.  I was amazed, that my &quot;uninteresting&quot; kids are being creative.  THEN out of curiosity, I gave a copy of Home Training Tools to my 91/2 yr daughter and just asked her to look through it and see if anything is interesting to her.  I was SHOCKED!!  She practically begged for a disecting kit.  &quot;You&#39;re kidding!&quot; I thought.  Now that&#39;s something I would NEVER have picked out for her.  I told my husband and he was excited and said he wants to do it with her.  She also said she&#39;s interested in robots but wants to spend her own money on it.  Now my youngest, I did the same with her and she has expensive taste.  I had to read the catalog to her but she really wants a rock tumbler, stereoscope, and a dinsaur replica to build.  I just have to say, I am blown away.  Now if I could only get my youngest to read!!  Life would be easier.  <br/>\nSue<br/>\nSaddle Mountain Academy<br/>\n        Snake River Plains<br/>\n      ++         ++<br/>\n   +     ++ +       +<br/>\n+                          +<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38345,"nextTopicId":38149}}
