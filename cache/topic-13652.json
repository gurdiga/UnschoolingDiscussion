There are days when I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-604952870\">Hi Sherry:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am unschooling only one child, a boy who is seven, and there are lots of <br/>\ntimes I ask myself the question you have asked. There are days when I <br/>\nsuggest many activities my son and I could do together and he doesn&#39;t like <br/>\nany of them; he would prefer to work alone, on a computer program usually, <br/>\nor finish some Lego project. I feel quite unnecessary sometimes, except for <br/>\nlunches, driving him to the activities he likes, and the <br/>\nall-important  touch-base-with Mom hugs that are needed here and <br/>\nthere.  Also, I am coming to realize that parents won&#39;t always share the <br/>\npassions of their children; although I play with my son and share his <br/>\nprojects, my passions tend towards nature and natural history, not cars and <br/>\ncomputer games. (Sometimes I just can&#39;t stand playing car racing games just <br/>\none more time, and my son yawns when I get excited about seeing a new bird <br/>\nin the yard!) I guess it&#39;s good that these children can self-direct, but <br/>\nthat points up the fact that we adults should also be self-directed and <br/>\nfind things about which we can become passionate. Of course, that requires <br/>\ndeciding what interests us and pursuing those interests, thus providing a <br/>\ngood example of adults (especially female adults) leading full lives. This <br/>\nis sometimes easier said than done, at least I have found it <br/>\nso.  Unschoolers say that boredom is often a good thing because it leads us <br/>\non to new interests. Are there any hobbies or past interests that you may <br/>\nwant to revisit? Or perhaps learn something new? Well, I am still working <br/>\non finding my interests, but I can definitely say they won&#39;t include more <br/>\nhousework! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I feel we are in a similar place as far as age (I&#39;m <br/>\nturning 41) and more children go. I had a miscarriage over two years ago <br/>\nand we haven&#39;t really been trying since, but I am rethinking this idea <br/>\n(although I am worried about childbirth at this age). I am also thinking <br/>\nabout adopting an older child (perhaps toddler age?), but wonder how <br/>\nhomeschooling would affect adoption. I feel I have the time and love to <br/>\ngive to another child, but my son has been used to being an only for so <br/>\nlong that he prefers not sharing his parents with anyone else. I have <br/>\nsuggested the idea and he isn&#39;t thrilled. It is true that I am more <br/>\navailable to him now for sports play, field trips and one-on-one play than <br/>\nI would be if we had another child, especially another infant. But there <br/>\nare other personal, emotional issues that go into the decision to add to <br/>\none&#39;s family that need to be considered. It is difficult to weigh all the <br/>\noptions sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I am rambling. As a final thought, sometimes when I am feeling <br/>\nisolated and my son has spent a lot of time absorbed in one thing, I try to <br/>\nget us out of the house to do something we both like, or I spend some time <br/>\ninvestigating fresh ideas for field trips and start planning something. A <br/>\nchange of scene breaks the monotony, and if we involve other friends and <br/>\ntheir parents, I get to exchange ideas with other adults while my son has a <br/>\ngood time with other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this was too long!<br/>\nOlivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Message: 2<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2000 22:19:56 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: Sherry Hagen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oilmagic@...\">oilmagic@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: homeschooling an only child<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hi folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I wonder how many people out there are homeschooling an only child.
