I&#39;ve never seen anyone smoke pot or <br/>\ntake drugs, and I&#39;ve seen very few drunkards.  I&#39;ll tell you some <br/>\npossibilities for why I think that is so, and you can pick the ones <br/>\nyou think are most likely:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I grew up in small towns in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s in NY state (yep, NY <br/>\nhas some small towns out there).  This stuff was not as common as in <br/>\ncities, I suspect.<br/>\n2. I probably wouldn&#39;t recognize pot or drugs (but I would recognize <br/>\nbruised kids and stories of beatings if I had heard them).<br/>\n3. I have always lived in good neighborhoods. Even though my father <br/>\nas a minister did not make much money, the parsonages supplied by the <br/>\nchurches were in good neighborhoods.<br/>\n4. I have always lived in houses or upscale apartments (was single <br/>\nuntil age 39 so could afford them &lt;s&gt;).<br/>\n5. The places I have lived in did not have visible &quot;child abuse&quot; <br/>\naround me.  This one makes me wonder if I picked the few places it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen, or if it is less widespread than some people think.  <br/>\nThese places include Philmont/Walden/Somers NY state, Akron OH, <br/>\nIrving/Dallas TX, Minneapolis, and now Poughkeepsie NY.<br/>\n6. I WAS a rather geeky, nerdy child.  We didn&#39;t really &quot;get out&quot; <br/>\nmuch, but I was allowed to ride my bike all over the countryside by <br/>\nmyself (can&#39;t let the kids do that today, but would love to) and we <br/>\nhad a fair number of people visit us.  I attended public schools all <br/>\nthe way through (but despise the &quot;socialization&quot; that I got from <br/>\nthem). For many years now I have presented week-long technical <br/>\ncomputer courses all over the world to groups of up to 50, so I got <br/>\nOJS (on the job socialization).  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n7.I grew up getting a few spankings in my life (less than 6) and took <br/>\nthem for granted, just as today if I see them administered in a <br/>\nloving fashion (see another post of mine for narrow definition of <br/>\nspanking vs. brutalization) I take it for granted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen a few spankings, by the way, but I am not counting them <br/>\nas viewing child abuse.  I have not seen beltings, bruisings, <br/>\nbeatings, or even horrific verbal abuse.  Believe it or not.  If I <br/>\never see bruising going on, I will make a judgment on whether to step <br/>\nin or not (I am no longer geeky, perhaps a little nerdy still, but <br/>\nquite athletic for 51).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1512150,"authorName":"Peggy","from":"Peggy &lt;peggy@...&gt;","profile":"margotapple","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Aware of Child Abuse (was Re: Are we in this together?)","postDate":"1035344718","msgId":47452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQjYxQjRFLjM0QzQ1QTk2QGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+","referencesHeader":"PGFwNDI2ZytzMmk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47463,"prevInTime":47451,"nextInTime":47453,"topicId":47452,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mike, How can you live in this world for 51 years and NOT see child abuse?
