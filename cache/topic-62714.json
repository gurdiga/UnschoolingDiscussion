Maybe it&#39;s just YOUR time they are wanting, which is most likely true <br/>\nand it&#39;s hard to figure out how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children all had special interests and when they no longer went to school <br/>\nit made it so much easier to persue.  I took one child (the child who NEVER <br/>\nwanted to leave the house) to FL alone once, we flew down, rented a car and <br/>\nspent seven days at Nasa, no Disney, no crowds, just exploring what he was <br/>\ninterested in.  You could do that on a smaller scale right here at home by <br/>\nhiring a sitter while the one child has a special day.  My younger child <br/>\nloved to fish, I frequently packed lunches and we went to the lake but I <br/>\nlearned that he wanted HIS special time to be alone, just the two of us at <br/>\nthe lake, we did that too.  One child was amused by simple &quot;doing&quot; lunch and <br/>\nshopping at the mall without another child whinning to go home.  Yet another <br/>\nchild was very hard to please and find an interest, even though she did many <br/>\nthings nothing seemed like enough for her and it was always hard.  Now it&#39;s <br/>\nlike she is an only child and there are days when she tells the other kids to <br/>\ngo home to their own houses, the house is too noisy for her, they mostly just <br/>\nlaugh at her and tell her to go to her room, but parenting goes on, probably <br/>\neven from the grave.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I wish I had learned to do earlier was savor every single <br/>\nminute of my childrens childhood, even the hard times, the times you feel you <br/>\njust can&#39;t do it, because they are over so very soon, instead of feeling <br/>\nfrustrated, I wish I would have looked at things differently so much sooner.  <br/>\nI so often wish I had come to homeschooling when they were babies instead of <br/>\nlater in their lives so I could have had that much more time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to thank you for the wonderful (and some not so wonderful) memories <br/>\nthis thread has helped me relive and to apologize for my lengthy rambling <br/>\nresponses.  I just wish I could find the words to help you understand that <br/>\nTHIS is childhood, the perfect household days happen, but not every day, so <br/>\ntry to find the joy in the little things and don&#39;t let this control your <br/>\ndays.  Even though it&#39;s so very hard I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: handling conflict","postDate":"1049376295","msgId":62809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0LjM3YjYxMGZlLjJiYmQ5MDI3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62798,"nextInTopic":62813,"prevInTime":62808,"nextInTime":62810,"topicId":62714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/3/2003 12:56:12 AM Eastern Standard Time, sheran@ptd.net ...

It&#39;s much harder to try to <br/>\nget the child to let you kow what the REAL problem is and to help you find a <br/>\nsolution to make the home a more peaceful place.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery child is different, different things work for different children, they <br/>\nrespond quite differently to almost everthing, so a lot of parenting is trial <br/>\nand error but the answer is somewhere in your heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard when one child finds pleasure in tormenting another one but really <br/>\ndon&#39;t we all have to learn to get along with people who do things that <br/>\nirritate us?  So one child sings, loudly, maybe even badly, that child is <br/>\nsharing the joy of their heart.  Maybe the child who is irritated wishes <br/>\nhe/she were that joyful and beomes sullen and irritated by the joy coming <br/>\nfrom said child.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you know your own child best, but I&#39;m still learning what works <br/>\nwith each of my children and they are not babies to anyone but me anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example is I&#39;ve always been loud, I sometimes (too often) had a short <br/>\ntemper when the children were all little, a loud voice would immediately stop <br/>\nan unwanted behaviour in my older two children, my third seemed oblivious and <br/>\nmy fourth would immediately break into tears.  I had to consciously try to <br/>\nhold back and change the way I responded to things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only found out maybe a year or two ago that when my third child (who is <br/>\nmost like me and will blow a gasket in a second and rant for ever it seems) <br/>\ndid something very unpleasant the best way to speak to him to get him to <br/>\nlisten is in a very soft almost wisper almost baby talk, he listens without <br/>\nyelling or defending or throwing a fit.  Something that I had consciously <br/>\ntried to always use in childhood, I should have been more cognizant of during <br/>\nhis teen years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many things that HAVE to be done before considering giving the <br/>\nchild the directive to leave the house.  Such a threat will fall on deaf ears <br/>\nanyway.  Nothing changed with my child because he was threatened with leaving <br/>\nthe home, nor did it change when he was put outside the door without a key in <br/>\nthe middle of winter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that my son even wanted to come back to a place that was so cruel to <br/>\nhim is a mystery to me but I&#39;m thankful for it nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nTALKING is what made the difference, quiet reflective talking, well that and <br/>\nthe tears I think, tears have such a cleansing effect on the soul sometimes <br/>\nand children don&#39;t like to see their parents cry.

Tara has her own room, Joseph does and Sierra and Alyssa share. If Sierra wants to be alone, I&#39;ll try and keep Alyssa occupied or even Joseph will play with her in the playroom. Then with Tara gone most of the time, I can always send someone in there too to watch tv or a movie that no one else wants to see. Then we have the living room. What about setting up a place in your bedroom when one needs alone time? Kids just need a small spot and the chance to shut the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as more one on one time with older ones, what about having someone in to play with one or two of them while you attend to the others? Or a relative taking one out for awhile so you have some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra and Alyssa usually like to go with me when I go out. Target, Petsmart or even Publix. (grocery store) Joseph doesn&#39;t like to so I make a point of going somewhere he likes with just him. I try real hard to make times to go out with each child, just me and them. It makes the home time less stressed when they all want me. They each feel like they get their time. I&#39;ve made 3 separate trips to Target in one week buying each child new shoes. It was just for shoes and of course they spent some time in the toy aisle But it was just me and one child and that was very special for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here is doing something annoying to another, it depends on the circumstances as to who should stay or not. One cannot go into someone else&#39;s room and be annoying. If they are in the playroom and they alone are bothering everyone else, they are asked to take it in their own room. If they are in the living room or dining room or kitchen, then the annoyed ones get to go to the playroom or their own rooms. Then there&#39; s always outside. They are never asked to stop, just take it elsewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as outtings go, I haven&#39;t run into this much as a problem. Once in awhile, one will want to leave. I&#39;ll ask them to just be patient for awhile as the others are having fun and it&#39;s not fair for them to have to leave. Usually I can get the frustrated one all happy again and they change their mind. Just happened today at the park. We were there from 12-5:00. Joseph got a bit annoyed at his sister around 3:00 and said he wanted to go. I took him aside, wiped him down from the dirt and sweat, got him something to drink and just talked about why he was upset and then about nothing to do with that. He changed his mind and happily stayed until I needed to go at 5:00. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcusing yourself from the conversation could have let him know how important his dilemma was to you. Taking some time to calm him down first, then talk might have made a difference. Children for the most part are easy to get involved with something else once they know you are really into what they are feeling. Sometimes just knowing you understand makes all the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: handling conflict","postDate":"1049348199","msgId":62792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5LjMyMDM4ZWE5LjJiYmQyMjY3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62791,"nextInTopic":62797,"prevInTime":62791,"nextInTime":62793,"topicId":62714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/2/03 10:17:59 PM, sheran@ptd.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1028071565\">In a message dated 4/2/03 10:17:59 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; They refuse to play, because each child knows that there is a very <br/>\n<br/>\nreal possiblity that he might be the loser.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they do it enough, they&#39;ll also figure out that they have an equally good <br/>\nchance of being a winner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you&#39;re playing now, there&#39;s a loser, only they&#39;re blaming you for your <br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take yourself out as arbiter or judge and let it be random, they can <br/>\nstill be frustrated, but they won&#39;t be resentful of you (maybe).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think the problem is that no one wants to be the last one up.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you glorify last one up, and make it more valuable, the other problem will <br/>\nlessen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: handling conflict","postDate":"1049348169","msgId":62791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2Z2g4OSt1aThiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxLjJkOTM4NDAxLjJiYmQxMDc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62789,"nextInTopic":62792,"prevInTime":62790,"nextInTime":62792,"topicId":62714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Perhaps I m being overly optimistic, that there s always a way to work through what s causing them to act that way.

I hate when three different children want me to <br/>\ndo three different things at the same time.  It can be really hard to <br/>\ncome up with ways to make everyone happy.

Some nights they accept it peacefully <br/>\nbut sometimes they fight over it.  Especially my 9 year old, because <br/>\nshe used to have me exclusively for Uno until her brother learned how <br/>\nto play.  It&#39;s just not fun playing with one child while the other <br/>\nchild pouts and cries about having to wait his turn right beside <br/>\nhim.  Last night my daughter was having an especially hard time <br/>\naccepting that she had to share me, and I solved the problem by <br/>\npulling out a book that I had bought and put aside for a special <br/>\ntime.  So she didn&#39;t mind sitting and reading the new book every time <br/>\nI played a hand with her brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could get a second deck of cards, set the three year old on <br/>\nthe table beside you, and let him &quot;play&quot; while you play?  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 3.

I suggest he play GBA in the car for twenty minutes or <br/>\n&gt; so since we&#39;d driven all the way there, I was in the middle of a <br/>\n&gt; conversation, and his youngest brother was having fun playing.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; isn&#39;t acceptable to him,  so we end up leaving with half of us <br/>\n&gt; resentful that we left and half of us resentful that we wasted an <br/>\n&gt; hour going in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I can relate!  I have a son who just doesn&#39;t like to leave his <br/>\nhouse.  I&#39;ve already gone places--playgrounds, skating rinks, <br/>\nlibraries, etc.--because the 9 and 3 year old want to go but the 5 <br/>\nyear old doesn&#39;t.  Nothing will make him happy when I drag him away <br/>\nfrom the house and he spends the whole time pulling on me trying to <br/>\nget me to go home.  It&#39;s exhausting when he&#39;s like that!  The best <br/>\nsolution of course is to try to go on excursions when my husband is <br/>\nhome so that he can just stay home with him, but when there&#39;s a <br/>\nbirthday party at noon and dh is still at work, the only way to take <br/>\n2 of the kids who want to go is to drag him along to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it were my oldest child having the problem you described (It&#39;s <br/>\nso much easier coming up with a solution for someone else, isn&#39;t it? <br/>\nlol) I would probably try apologizing to my friend that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nkeep chatting because my child needs my help with a struggle he&#39;s <br/>\nhaving.  If she&#39;s a good enough friend and if your younger child is <br/>\ncomfortable with you being away for a little while, maybe even ask <br/>\nher to keep an eye on my youngest child, and take the older child for <br/>\na walk and listen to his troubles and give him some mommy support.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.

They <br/>\nthink it&#39;s funny when big sister cries and throws a fit and yells and <br/>\nscreams all kinds of things at them in frustration.  I told her that <br/>\nwhen they bother her to go to her room and scream in her pillow and <br/>\ncalm herself down, or even to quietly ask me to come with her to her <br/>\nroom and talk and cry with me so that they don&#39;t see that they have <br/>\nthe power to get her to put on a show for them.  She doesn&#39;t listen <br/>\nto my advice all the time though. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could go on.  Sometimes it seems that the intense family <br/>\n&gt; togetherness that unschooling brings is one big exercise for me in <br/>\n&gt; mediating conflict and hanging onto my sanity by a thread.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For those of you with more than one child, how do you deal with the <br/>\n&gt; rift between what I perceive to be the unschooling &quot;ideal&quot; <br/>\n&gt; (everybody happily doing their thing, together or apart, and <br/>\n&gt; supporting each other&#39;s journeys) and the day to day reality which <br/>\n&gt; can be quite different?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Help.<br/>\n&gt; Patti<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For me, I still see the unschooling &quot;ideal&quot; in our day to day reality <br/>\nbut sometimes I feel overwhelmed and think that the only way things <br/>\ncan be truly peaceful all the time is if there were more than just <br/>\none adult in the house striving towards the idea.  When dh is home <br/>\nthings are easier, because while I take one child somewhere he can <br/>\nstay home with the one who doesn&#39;t want to leave home, or he can play <br/>\na game with someone while I make supper, or comfort a child while I <br/>\ntalk to another.  The moments when all three kids want to do the same <br/>\nthing, or one can keep himself occupied while I do something with <br/>\nanother are precious, but they certainly don&#39;t happen all the time!  <br/>\nI often have three kids  pulling me in three different directions.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve found that there is often a creative solution if you&#39;re willing <br/>\nto really apply yourself but not always.  Or sometimes I&#39;m just too <br/>\ntired to think clearly enough to come up with a creative solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am resolved that if my children have children, I want to be <br/>\navailable to them to help them unschool their children.  If my <br/>\ndaughter has three kids pulling her in three different directions, <br/>\ngrandma Sheila will be there to take one or two of them and do <br/>\nsomething really special with them while their mom does what she <br/>\nneeds to do with the other one.  I really think that an active, <br/>\nloving grandmother involved in the lives of families with young <br/>\nchildren could GREATLY contribute to the peace of the family.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that you get better coming up with creative solutions <br/>\nwith practice.  I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes and had to put a lot of <br/>\nthought into thinking of ways that I could have done things better. <br/>\nSometimes I can&#39;t figure out how I could have dealt with the <br/>\nsituation better and I post on here and ask for ideas.  I always get <br/>\nawesome input here.   Then when a similar situation comes up again I <br/>\nhave a better idea of how to handle it.  There is nothing more <br/>\nsatisfying to me than to have an especially difficult situation with <br/>\nmy children come up and for me to be able to sit back afterwards and <br/>\nsay, &quot;Wow, I handled that really well!&quot;  And I think it&#39;s that desire <br/>\nto be able to say that all the time that makes me a little bit moody <br/>\nwhen things don&#39;t turn out as peacefully as I had hoped.  I have to <br/>\nconstantly keep reminding myself that in real life the roads won&#39;t <br/>\nalways be smooth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne time when they were fighting over who I would tuck in first, with <br/>\none jumping on me, crying and trying to pull me off the bed because <br/>\nhe thought I should be tucking him in first, I bribed one of them.  I <br/>\njust quietly whispered to him that if he lets me lay with his brother <br/>\nuntil he falls asleep, I would go downstairs and make chocolate chip <br/>\ncookies with him.  He agreed and we ended up having an extra special <br/>\nnight together.  I almost didn&#39;t do it, because I thought to myself <br/>\nthat I can&#39;t get into the habit of bribing.   Sooner or later it will <br/>\nstop working because they&#39;ll catch on, or sometimes I&#39;ll be too tired <br/>\nto stay up really late doing activities to make one child happy <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t get tucked in first.  But that night I figured that <br/>\nI just really wanted peace right at that moment and that I would <br/>\nworry about tomorrow night when tomorrow came.  And yes, I have <br/>\nnights that they all want tucked in first and I just have to choose <br/>\none.  I&#39;ve tried taking turns so it&#39;s fair and they don&#39;t like that.  <br/>\nBut when I take it one night at a time and really concentrate on the <br/>\npresent moment and ask myself just for THIS NIGHT how can I help <br/>\nthese guys go to bed happy, I often come up with happy solutions.  <br/>\nNot always!  But often. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: handling conflict","postDate":"1049330354","msgId":62753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2ZnZyaSttNzNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3LjFhOWVlMmIwLjJiYmNjOWExQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62746,"nextInTopic":62767,"prevInTime":62752,"nextInTime":62754,"topicId":62714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... yard and ... home under ... what needs to ...
