I<br/>\nabsolutely love it here.  Jobs are a little more scarce than in big<br/>\ncities of course, but cost of living is much lower than the Bay Area for<br/>\nsure.  Santa Maria is the cheapest, with houses in the 200s still,<br/>\nthough some people are snobbish about Santa Maria because it&#39;s more<br/>\nagricultural (read: &quot;worse&quot; schools because of language issues, plenty<br/>\nof field workers).  San Luis is more expensive, cheapest houses are<br/>\nprobably in the 500s.  It&#39;s a university town and people that live there<br/>\nlove it.  There&#39;s a very cute downtown, with a big ole Farmer&#39;s Market<br/>\nevery week that shuts down the area.  The 5 Cities are in between, beach<br/>\ntowns such as Shell Beach, Pismo Beach, Grover Beach, Oceano and Arroyo<br/>\nGrande.  They are in between in price range also, and are right at the<br/>\nbeach.  They get pretty crowded during tourist attacks, especially<br/>\nPismo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah<br/>\nSee my/our blog: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bruceportal.com\">http://www.bruceportal.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90149243,"authorName":"Michelle~ms65442","from":"&quot;Michelle~ms65442&quot; &lt;ms65442@...&gt;","profile":"ms1965442","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-Discussion] Big cities","postDate":"1058846481","msgId":77215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzNTAwNSRlYjMwYWM0MCQ5OTIwNGE0M0Bjb21wdXRlcj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzNGZhZiRhYTNlNWEzMCQzODc3ZmVhOUBNT01TVE9ZPg=="},"prevInTopic":77119,"nextInTopic":77222,"prevInTime":77214,"nextInTime":77216,"topicId":76896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok Sarah, I’m looking to get out of the Bay Area and have to ask – where is this wonderful place you live?
