Since repetition and consistency in <br/>\nthese past 3 days, James has gotten much better in his studies and <br/>\nseems to be enjoying it. We&#39;re going to approach him with going to <br/>\nan African drum session and participating in building a drum. We&#39;ll <br/>\nsee how he responds to that. Truthfully, when I try to have a real <br/>\nconversation with him as of late, he seems to be more responsive. <br/>\nMaybe its because we&#39;re spending more time together, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the posts are so rightist,not within our political beliefs, <br/>\nhow our backgrounds and history are not the same that its very <br/>\nobvious. We found info. we could use in some of the posts. Still,in <br/>\nothers I read to my friends and they couldn&#39;t understand where the <br/>\nhell those fly balls came from - too much insight in to a situation <br/>\nwhere a child has been failed and has given up and needs an <br/>\nenvironment that is more balanced; or at least conducive to <br/>\nlearning. That&#39;s why they moved here with us. That&#39;s why we&#39;re <br/>\nposting on boards and seeking advice. We&#39;ve already passed this age, <br/>\nits his turn and its more about him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted this same situation on an African unschooling site and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get such feedback, but suggestions on how to approach it all <br/>\nbecause they could relate, the language of different context and <br/>\ncircumstances for different races is an issue in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\nGwen, I know you didn&#39;t mean anything by your comments. I know how <br/>\nit is to have to continue to post to clarify what you meant. Its <br/>\npossible that 2 people can have a conversation and walk away and not <br/>\nknow/understand what the other was talking about in the end - I <br/>\nbelieve some of the posts were just that. I really appreciate what <br/>\nyou were trying to get to.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nthe smart mouthed woman named Latoya in Florida who is listening to <br/>\nthe 6 year old that says she can get rid of her hiccups by counting <br/>\nto 10 (I hope no one reads anything more in to this statement than <br/>\nthe 6 year old that says she can get rid of her hiccups by counting <br/>\nto 10)...1, 2, 3, 4,...</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105541,"nextTopicId":105256}}
