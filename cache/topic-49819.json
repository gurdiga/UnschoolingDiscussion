There have been<br/>\nsome wonderful stories about kids having *ah-ha* moments. I usually wonder<br/>\nto myself if my kids have ever had one of those. Well today I witnessed one.<br/>\nA neighbor was having a room added onto their house. A week ago I asked the<br/>\nconstruction dudes if we could have any scrap lumber. The kids love to<br/>\n*make* things. So they have been dropping off pieces here and there. Today<br/>\nmy 7 year old took two long pieces and nailed them together in a *t* shape.<br/>\nBut was frowning because she wanted the top piece to be like an arm that<br/>\nswung around (to take the beanie babies for a ride at the amusement park)<br/>\nbut it just drug on the ground. So to fix the problem she took two small<br/>\nblocks and lifted the whole *t* up and put it on the blocks. But then told<br/>\nme she forgot about the weight of the beanies and wasn&#39;t sure still if it<br/>\nwould work. She was right, the beanies weighed it down. Finally she asked me<br/>\nto take the nail out of the middle of the *t*, she then put a small block<br/>\nbetween the bottom and top piece, nailed it together and swung those beanies<br/>\nhappily for at least an hour.  I was so surprised at her and it just made me<br/>\nlaugh.<br/>\nThanks for letting me share!<br/>\nCathy H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE:Worried and full of self doubt","postDate":"1037384338","msgId":49851,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5My4xMGIxYjY2Ni4yYjA2OTQ5MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49846,"nextInTopic":49874,"prevInTime":49850,"nextInTime":49852,"topicId":49819,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/15/02 11:05:33 AM, aymee13@alltel.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-546721330\">In a message dated 11/15/02 11:05:33 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aymee13@...\">aymee13@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My son is only 3, but I taught him the majority<br/>\nof stuff he knows online at safe kid sites and through books and<br/>\ntelevision.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you think of it as his learning instead of your teaching?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; We had to teach him the alphabet and phonics through<br/>\nsinging and reading so he could talk&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would knowing phonics and the alphabet help anyone speak?

DH will be home Sunday, and every evening. Yes, no matter what, when it comes to doing new things with our children, uncertainy and nervousness are perfectly natural! We wouldn&#39;t be moms otherwise. &lt;g&gt; Playing is wonderful!!! Watch them carefully, and see what they&#39;re learning. Sharing, probably. Compromise maybe? Fine motor skills, definitely. Perhaps some math skills as they keep up with the number of cars they have? Go drag out some wooden blocks and sit down with them.... make some bridges and jumps and mazes/obstical courses for the cars, tables and chairs for the dolls. They&#39;ll probably join in and get some geometry and thinking and problem-solving practice. If they don&#39;t join in, no biggie, they&#39;ll remember it for sometime in the future. Unschooling isn&#39;t just about leaving them alone to do what they want to do, it&#39;s about doing things together and learning together. When lunchtime comes, ask who wants to help you cook. Use a recipe, and have your readers tell your non-readers what to get and how much of it you need. There&#39;s more math, and home ec - not to mention a big feeling of accomplishment they&#39;ll have. Eventually, you&#39;ll get to where you won&#39;t look for the educational value in things at all, but to begin with, it really helps to realize that they&#39;re learning no matter what they&#39;re doing.<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  Possible.  He does not use the computer much, lol.  I will see though.  Is this uncertain feeling normal?

This is our first year.  My children spent a few years in a private Christian school.  I have 4 babies &lt;grin&gt; ranging from 12-3.  We started out this year buying about 1,000 in school supplies (Alpha Omega).  Ya know the boxed curric.  This did ok for a few weeks but I could see the kids crying, struggling, and hating school.  So we switched to a more CM approach with the Simply Series from Shoebox Publications.  These seem to do ok but I still had tears.  On Tuesday I decided to put away the books and try unschooling.  I am worried that I am failing them by doing this.  It definatly feels like I am being a lazy momma and they are having a ball playing.  They do read books ALOT.  I asked them whet they wanted to learn about and got 4 diff answers so we went to the library yesterday and they all picked out books.  Some are picture books BUT they are still books.  My 6yo and 8yo are fluent readers.  My 12 you is not and really does not like to read.  He checks out magic books, and books with pictures mainly so I worry about him.  I am just scared.  My family does not accept HSing at all and when my mom calls mid morning and asks if school is over for the day I get the &quot;hmmmm&quot; when I tell her we are.  DH is very supportive of HSing.  However I printed out a few articles about unschooling and he does not get it and is not too excited that we won&#39;t be teaching lessons per say.  Maybe it is his doubt of <br/>\n  this that is making me get so scared.  I know noone else that unschools.  I am in a local HSing group but I believe most use a boxed curric or unit studies.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So my ? is.  Is it possible that my kids will suffer from this type of NON schooling?  This all seems to easy for me and DH says it is just a name I am using to condone my lack of drive to do lessons.  He is VERY supportive of HSing and is super supportive (HSing was HIS idea).  I don&#39;t want anyone thinking he is not.  He is just in the school mind that lessons, books, drills, worksheets, memorizing are all key to learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherry   <br/>\n  Unschooling Soap Diva WAHM to 4 :o)<br/>\n  naturalsimplicity.ewahm.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
