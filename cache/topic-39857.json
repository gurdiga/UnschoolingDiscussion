In all the states I know about, a private<br/>\nschool must be registered with the state and follow state regulations, or<br/>\nelse the students they enroll are considered delinquent. In California,<br/>\nat least, that means that when the children show up at school, they are<br/>\nrequired to stay for at least 4 hours, to meet state attendance<br/>\nregulations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, often the flavor of these schools varies a lot depending on who the<br/>\nfounders are. Some are very anti-parent, some are anti-tv, few if any are<br/>\ntruly as democratic as they say, IME.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see as the real problem, though, is the idea that children need to<br/>\ngo somewhere away from their families to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of setting up learning resource centers where people of<br/>\nall ages are welcome.I also like Ivan Illich&#39;s ideas about creating 4<br/>\nnetworks of educational resources:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.A reference service to educational objects (which ould be just about<br/>\nanything).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Skill exchanges, where people who are willing to serve as models or<br/>\nmentors for others trying to learn a skill list their skills<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Peer Matching , which allows people to find others with similar<br/>\ninterests and skill levels<br/>\n<br/>\n4.Educators at-Large , who would be more like career counselors or<br/>\nlearning facilitators than traditional educators - they might help a<br/>\nperson wanting to learn a foreign language find the methods that would<br/>\nwork best for him,   for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36888606,"authorName":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare","from":"Luz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;nedvare@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2192 UN in a nutshell","postDate":"1028578397","msgId":39857,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5NzQzREE0LjExOEUlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjg1NjQ4NTUuMTI0Ny45NDYxOS5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39867,"prevInTime":39856,"nextInTime":39858,"topicId":39857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 8/5/02 12:27 PM, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at ...
