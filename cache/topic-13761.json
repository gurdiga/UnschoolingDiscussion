Many aren&#39;t by the end of grade 2.  Many don&#39;t read for<br/>\nenjoyment much before grade 4 or so, if they haven&#39;t been damaged by the<br/>\nsystem and turned off from reading altogether.  My 7.5 yr old participates<br/>\nin an America Reads program at our public library and tonight I took a<br/>\npeek at his file.  *I* think he&#39;s still struggling to read and he rarely<br/>\nreads for enjoyment or pleasure as opposed to achieve a specific goal<br/>\n(like the directions to a Pokemon game).  He still makes lots of mistakes<br/>\nand is clueless a lot of the time if the context isn&#39;t really clear.  <br/>\nYet, the tutors he has worked with have continually said that he is<br/>\nsignificanlty &quot;abve grade level&quot; and has &quot;superior skills&quot; for his<br/>\nage/grade.  So, OK, those comments give me some assurance, but they also<br/>\ntell me that most 2nd graders don&#39;t read well, regardless of what people<br/>\nsay.  And, if allowed to grow on their own, these same kids *will* (most<br/>\nlikely) be independent readers one day.....<br/>\ndawn h-s</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"marianne","from":"&quot;marianne &quot; &lt;tonitoni@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"HpfYigsdNF7dQpdONu-pd385nIUkXCdbOC6ZUMFuz206cOsSgJa8BODJORzCluDRANAU7k66r-rlusEVzT4LyjtSR83H3tvjiw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re.reading","postDate":"972361983","msgId":13761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDh0MzNkditjbDBsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13762,"prevInTime":13760,"nextInTime":13762,"topicId":13761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"All my children went to ps - I removed my youngest from ps 6 months ago, she is now 12yrs old My eldest could read before he went to school.
