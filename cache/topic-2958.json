Nine other school jurisdictions were affected <br/>\nas<br/>\nwell, but the company refused to name them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools Chancellor Rudy Crew called for an independent audit of the testing<br/>\ncompany, which received more than $2 million from the school board in 1998,<br/>\nand demanded company officials attend a board meeting Wednesday to explain<br/>\nhow the error occurred.<br/>\n<br/>\nStudent test scores were incorrectly lowered because of a mathematical <br/>\nerror,<br/>\nsaid CTBMcGraw-Hill spokesman Steven Weiss. He said scores would rise<br/>\n``modestly upward&#39;&#39; with the use of new calibrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe explanation did little to mollify angry school officials, parents and<br/>\nstudent advocacy groups as the board scrambled to identify the students and<br/>\nfigure out the extent of the mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tests, given last spring to 300,000 students in grades three, five, six<br/>\nand seven, weighed heavily in determining that 35,000 students needed to<br/>\nattend summer school.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrew, who spearheaded the effort to end the system&#39;s longtime practice of<br/>\npromoting students with failing grades, said in August that there were<br/>\ninitial indications that most of the summer schoolers would pass on to the<br/>\nnext grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he revised that estimate this month, announcing that 60 percent of <br/>\nsummer<br/>\nschool students would have to repeat their current grade because about <br/>\n14,000<br/>\nstudents didn&#39;t show up at summer school or didn&#39;t bother to take the final<br/>\ntest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe test problem was just another example to some that the city rushed its<br/>\nnew no-social-promotion agenda this summer without much thought or planning.<br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s another indication of how hurried and slapdash this whole process has<br/>\nbeen,&#39;&#39; said Jill Chaifetz, executive director of the Brooklyn based<br/>\nAdvocates for Children, which sued the Board of Education on behalf of<br/>\nparents whose children would be held back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAP-NY-09-15-99 1713EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n     GRAB THE GATOR!
