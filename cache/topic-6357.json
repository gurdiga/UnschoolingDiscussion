Dave and Cheri thought these kids were living with their cousins around the corner but the cousins had kicked them out and the kids were living in the CAR around the corner ... never said anything ... fabulous kids ... Dave and Cheri became emergency foster parents ... and 2 years later have fully adopted all 7 so they now homeschool ELEVEN kids... the curriculum they are using is called PACE (don&#39;t know what the &quot;p&quot; stands for but it&#39;s Accelerated Christian Education)... it&#39;s paced work that the kids do on their own schedule ... 12 paces per subject ... I LOVE it ... my daughter does her work and if she has problems I&#39;m here but I&#39;m not her &quot;task&quot; master ... they must pass each pace before moving on ... you can find out more about them on www.schooloftomorrow.com<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps your mom decide... they also have a school you can enroll in .... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I have mentioned Dave and Cheri does anybody know anybody in the media where I can get their story told?  I am just in love with these two people and their ELEVEN children ... Dave is a retired Navy SEAL and Cheri used to do all the volunteer work for us wives when our husband&#39;s deployed.... they have been a rock to SO many people ... I have written a few letters but have gotten no responses and I guess you just have to know somebody to get your voice heard... I would appreciate it ... thanks ttyl<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 23<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 10 Feb 2000 15:16:15 +0900<br/>\n   From: Shimokawa Family &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sfamily@...\">sfamily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Anyone in Mississippi?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody know of any homeschooling groups in Mississippi?  My dad has to<br/>\nstay in MS because of his job, but my mom is thinking about taking the<br/>\nkids (she still has four living at home) back to California because the<br/>\nschools are so much better there.  I&#39;ve discussed homeschooling (and<br/>\nunschooling) with her, but she still thinks that homeschooling is doing<br/>\nassignments at the kitchen table all day long.  So, if there are any<br/>\ngroups that anyone is aware of - my family is in Collinsville - near<br/>\nMeridian - please let me know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelanie in Japan<br/>\nAOL IM: Vouget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[This message contained attachments]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6356,"nextTopicId":6295}}
