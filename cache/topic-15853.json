References to<br/>\nthese connections can be found in many books and newspaper<br/>\narticles and on thousands of websites on the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have personally done two years of research which have<br/>\nconvinced me of the validity of these accusations involving<br/>\nthree generations of your family. Among the prominent authors<br/>\nthat link the Bush family directly to Nazi Germany is former<br/>\nUS Justice Department Nazi War Crimes Prosecutor, John<br/>\nLoftus, now the President of the Florida Holocaust Museum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I did not vote for you and feel the outcome of the 2000<br/>\nelection has questionable legitimacy, I fully accept that you are<br/>\nnow the President of the United States. Therefore, it is very<br/>\nimportant that you personally address these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the election I have observed a concerted public effort on<br/>\nyour part to &quot;reach out&quot; to groups such as African Americans<br/>\nand the disabled - the same groups your family targeted for<br/>\nelimination or sterilization in the past. I&#39;d like to believe this<br/>\nrepresents a dramatic change of heart on your part rather than<br/>\nbeing a cynical public relations effort intended to make people<br/>\nforget your family history - or worse - a smoke screen for more<br/>\nhorrors to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou frequently claim to be a man of faith, a born-again<br/>\nChristian. Both the old and new testaments you read from each<br/>\nday place great emphasis on repentance and forgiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that context it would seem appropriate that you respond to<br/>\nthese allegations, either by denying or acknowledging them<br/>\nand if true, publicly apologize to the American people. That,<br/>\nrather than empty rhetoric and political posturing, could go a<br/>\nlong way towards accomplishing the &quot;healing&quot; you seek.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purpose of clarity I will list and briefly summarize<br/>\nsome details of the four main allegations in question and ask<br/>\nthat you respond to each. References from books, newspapers<br/>\nand the websites of  think tanks and foundations associated<br/>\nwith you which support each allegation can be found on the<br/>\nwebsite and in the texts noted at the end of this letter.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. THE BUSH FAMILY FINANCED HITLER<br/>\n<br/>\nYour grandfather Prescott Bush (whose picture now hangs in<br/>\nthe oval office) and his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker<br/>\n(who you are named after) were managing directors, stock<br/>\nholders and board members of Brown Brothers Harriman, once<br/>\nthe most important private banking house in America. In that<br/>\ncapacity they personally directed a constellation of interlocking<br/>\ncompanies including the Hamburg-Amerika Shipping Line and<br/>\nthe Union Banking Corporation. In 1942 a number of their<br/>\ncompanies were seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian<br/>\nunder authority of the US Congress&#39; Trading with the Enemy<br/>\nAct, which declared them to be fronts for the Nazis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese companies functioned as a means of channeling<br/>\nhundreds of millions of dollars in cash and strategic war<br/>\nmaterials to Nazi Germany and to IG Farben, an oil, chemical<br/>\nand munitions cartel half-owned by John D Rockefellers&#39;<br/>\nStandard Oil. This same IG Farben built and operated<br/>\nAuschwitz and forty other slave labor factory/death camps.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this shameful corporate history did not end with<br/>\nthe WWII era. Many of the corporations such as GM, Alcoa,<br/>\nMonsanto and the various oil companies represented so<br/>\nabundantly by your cabinet appointees were also enthusiastic<br/>\nsupporters of Nazi Germany and in a number of instances were<br/>\ndirectly involved in IG Farbens&#39; slave labor factories, the<br/>\nHolocaust and eugenics. The origin of your family fortune and<br/>\nextensive political and corporate connections can virtually all<br/>\nbe directly traced to the Third Reich.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. THE BUSH FAMILY ARE THREE GENERATIONS OF<br/>\nEUGENICISTS<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile your public pronouncements have led many Americans<br/>\nto believe you are a principled opponent of abortion and a firm<br/>\nsupporter of equal rights for minorities, the mentally ill and the<br/>\ndisabled even a little research into your family background<br/>\npaints a very different picture. In close cooperation with the<br/>\nRockefeller and Harriman families - a relationship that began<br/>\nwith financing Hitler - your family has been at the forefront of<br/>\nthe American eugenics movement for almost seventy years.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour father and grandfather were both prominently involved in<br/>\nPlanned Parenthood at a time when this was a very<br/>\ncontroversial organization.  Known today as an advocate for a<br/>\nwomens&#39; right to choose, when your father and grandfather<br/>\nwere involved this organization was at the forefront of a<br/>\nnationwide movement to sterilize minorities, the mentally ill<br/>\nand the disabled. Its&#39; founder Margaret Sanger enthusiastically<br/>\nsupported Hitlers&#39; eugenics laws in the 1930&#39;s and sought to<br/>\nestablished them throughout the US. Both your father and<br/>\ngrandfather spent many years trying to limit the population of<br/>\nthird world nations which they saw as a threat to the<br/>\ndominance of the US. As a Congressman you father was<br/>\nnicknamed &quot;rubbers&quot; by his colleagues because of his<br/>\nobsession with limiting the birthrates of minorities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you and many of your advisors, both your father and<br/>\ngrandfather were associated with the Pioneer Fund, a private<br/>\neugenics foundation in NYC founded by Wycliffe Draper.<br/>\nDraper and other Pioneer Fund members helped Hitler draft<br/>\nboth Nazi Germany&#39;s racial laws and the US laws requiring<br/>\nmandatory court-ordered sterilization which at one time were<br/>\non the books in 30 States. These were the very laws Hitlers&#39;<br/>\neugenics laws - which led to the Holocaust -  were inspired by.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilliam H. Draper III, a relative of the Pioneer Fund&#39;s Wycliffe<br/>\nDraper and co-fundraising chairman for the 1980<br/>\nBush-for-President national campaign, has also been a leader<br/>\nof the world eugenics movement. His father, William H.<br/>\nDraper, Jr. was director of the German Credit and Investment<br/>\nCorp, a Nazi front company associated with your grandfather,<br/>\nPrescott Bush.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs UN Ambassador your father worked with both William H.<br/>\nDraper III and John D Rockefeller III to expand the activities<br/>\nof the Office of Population Control at the US Agency for<br/>\nInternational Development (USAID). Your father praised the<br/>\nlifelong eugenics efforts of both Rockefeller and Draper in an<br/>\nintroduction he wrote to a 1973 book, World Population Crisis:<br/>\nThe United States Response. Many researchers now believe the<br/>\nAfrican AIDs epidemic was the result of one of the many<br/>\ncovert population control techniques employed by USAID.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile chair of the Republican Task Force on Earth Resources<br/>\nand Population your father brought William Shockley, a noted<br/>\nrace scientist, before the US Congress to testify in support of<br/>\nShockleys&#39; &quot;Bonus Sterilization Plan&quot; which proposed offering<br/>\na cash incentive to African Americans, drug addicts and the<br/>\ndisabled who would voluntarily be sterilized as a means of<br/>\nreducing welfare, social security benefits and crime.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM IS THE NEW<br/>\nEUGENICS<br/>\n<br/>\nMost Americans know that while Governor of Texas you<br/>\npresided over more executions than any US governor or world<br/>\nleader, including the executions of women, the mentally ill and<br/>\nretarded prisoners. Simultaneously, under your watch Texas<br/>\nhas had the worst record of legal assistance to accused<br/>\nprisoners of any State. Your &quot;Guinness record&quot; for executions<br/>\nis consistent with the eugenics-based efforts of both your father<br/>\nand grandfather.<br/>\n<br/>\nNumerous members of your cabinet and staff have praised or<br/>\nare direct associates of Charles Murray, author of the Bell<br/>\nCurve, a classic text of eugenics which attempts to prove that<br/>\nAfrican Americans are genetically inferior and thus have the<br/>\nlowest IQ&#39;s of any race. This bogus theory is then used by<br/>\nMurray as the justification for eliminating welfare, affirmative<br/>\naction, social service programs and for building more prisons -<br/>\nall of which are ideas you are closely associated with. Almost<br/>\nevery reference in the Bell Curve about African Americans can<br/>\nbe directly traced to the Pioneer Fund, a eugenics organization<br/>\nwith long-standing ties to your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong your appointees and advisors who share an<br/>\norganizational or personal association to the Bell Curve are<br/>\nStephen Goldsmith, Tommy Thompson, Elaine Chou, Myron<br/>\nMagnet, Marvin Olasky, Linda Chavez, Karl Rove, Floyd<br/>\nFlake, Spencer Abraham and John Ashcroft. Even your<br/>\nminority advisors have a Bell Curve connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Health and Human Services Sec. Tommy Thompson,<br/>\nbased his welfare reforms while Governor of Wisconsin on<br/>\nMurrays&#39;&#39; books and employed Murray as a consultant. Your<br/>\nchief domestic policy advisor, Stephen Goldsmith, credits<br/>\nMurray with creating the entire welfare reform movement in<br/>\nthe US and recently introduced him as a great scholar at a<br/>\nwelfare seminar at the Manhattan Institute. Myron Magnet, the<br/>\nman whose book you claim has influenced you second only to<br/>\nthe bible, praises Murray in almost every article he writes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMurrays&#39;&#39; racially-charged ideas are extensively quoted and<br/>\nlavishly praised on the websites of the Heritage Foundation,<br/>\nThe Federalist Society and the Manhattan Institute - right wing<br/>\nthink tanks closely identified with you and virtually all of your<br/>\nappointees. On some of these websites Murray is mentioned<br/>\nhundreds of times, always as a visionary and brilliant thinker.<br/>\nThese foundations significantly contributed in numerous ways<br/>\nto your becoming President and even a number of the US<br/>\nSupreme Court Justices who ruled in your favor are members.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bell Curve was written at the Manhattan Institute, the very<br/>\nthink tank that you have publicly acknowledged as the source<br/>\nof your policy ideas. Murray continues to give speeches there<br/>\nto this day alongside some of your closest advisors.<br/>\n<br/>\nManhattan Institute senior fellows, John J. DiIulio Jr. and<br/>\nStephen Goldsmith, were just appointed by you to head up a<br/>\nmulti-billion dollar &quot;faith based initiative&quot; intended to replace<br/>\nsocial services. Consistent with many facts addressed in this<br/>\nletter, the Manhattan Institute was founded by former CIA<br/>\ndirector, William Casey - a close associate of your father - who<br/>\nspent the years following WWII bringing hundreds of former<br/>\nNazis involved in eugenics to the US.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. YOU HOPE TO MAKE CHRISTIANITY THE DEFACTO<br/>\n&quot;OFFICIAL&quot; RELIGION OF THE US<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have made numerous public statements both as Governor<br/>\nof Texas and US President which imply that Christianity is the<br/>\nofficial religion of this nation, a viewpoint apparently shared<br/>\nby many of your staff, cabinet members and advisors. As<br/>\ngovernor you created an official Texas State holiday, Jesus<br/>\nDay. I am unable to find any reference to you creating a<br/>\ncorresponding Moses Day, Buddha Day or Mohammed Day<br/>\ndespite your state having many citizens of those faiths.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike any other modern-day US President you have not<br/>\nappointed a single Jewish person to your diverse cabinet which<br/>\nuniquely has an Arab-American, a Chinese-American, a<br/>\nJapanese-American, an African-American and a<br/>\nCuban-American. While campaigning for President you<br/>\npublicly stated your belief that only those who accept Christ<br/>\ncan enter heaven, which implies that followers of other<br/>\nreligions - specifically Judaism - are condemned to hell. This<br/>\nsame statement has been used for centuries to justify<br/>\nanti-Semitism, forced conversions and genocide. At issue is not<br/>\nyour beliefs but that you chose to highlight this while running<br/>\nfor the nation&#39;s highest office, despite knowing it&#39;s historical<br/>\nuse as a means of fomenting anti-Semitism.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring your father&#39;s 1988 Presidential campaign it was<br/>\ndiscovered by a Jewish newspaper that at least ten former<br/>\nNazis, a number of them SS officials directly involved in<br/>\ncarrying out the Holocaust, were working in high-level<br/>\ncapacities within his campaign. Public pressure forced them to<br/>\nresign but later many resumed working with your father.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour father is also known to be a close friend, long-time ally<br/>\nand business partner of the Saudi royal family, as is your Vice<br/>\nPresident, Dick Cheney. During WWII this corrupt, virulently<br/>\nanti-Semitic dynasty - which was set up as rulers in the 1920&#39;s<br/>\nby your father&#39;s Wall Street oil business partners - were among<br/>\nHitler&#39;s most enthusiastic supporters.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour so-called faith-based initiative &quot;guru&quot;, Marvin Olasky,<br/>\nconverted from Judaism to Christianity and actively seeks to<br/>\nconvert other Jews as well. Unlike some participants in your<br/>\nfaith-based initiative, Mr. Olasky is honest enough to admit<br/>\nthat proselytizing will take place while social services are<br/>\nperformed at taxpayer expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of these facts and your families decade long efforts to<br/>\nfinance Nazi Germany it seems only fair to ask, are you an<br/>\nanti-Semite?<br/>\n<br/>\nMr. President, I understand that you have many important tasks<br/>\nto accomplish. Nevertheless, it seems essential that you<br/>\nrespond to these questions in detail without further delay. If as<br/>\nyou have repeatedly said, you are a, &quot;uniter not a divider&quot;, then<br/>\nnothing could do more to resolve the lingering doubts millions<br/>\nof Americans have about you, your agenda, your cabinet<br/>\nappointees and your presidency than straightforward answers<br/>\nto these questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe American people would surely be comforted to find that<br/>\nall of these charges are untrue and that you are in fact the<br/>\nhumble family man and born-again Christian your aides and<br/>\nthe corporate media are so intent on portraying to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nArticles containing detailed references and links to sources of<br/>\ninformation related to the above questions can be found at<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Baltech.org/lederman/spray/\">http://Baltech.org/lederman/spray/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand in the following books and articles among many others:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Secret War Against the Jews, by John Loftus and Mark<br/>\nAarons, St. Martin&#39;s Press; Trading with the Enemy by Charles<br/>\nHigham, 1983; The Splendid Blond Beast: Money Law and<br/>\nGenocide in the Twentieth Century by Christopher Simpson,<br/>\n1993; Blowback, by Christopher Simpson, Weidenfeld &<br/>\nNicolson 1988; OLD NAZIS, THE NEW RIGHT, AND THE<br/>\nREPUBLICAN PARTY by Russ Bellant; Philadelphia Inquirer<br/>\narticle by David Lee Preston, &quot;Fired Bush Backer One of<br/>\nSeveral with Possible Nazi Links,&quot; 9/10/88;  Author links Bush<br/>\nfamily to Nazis Sarasota Herald-Tribune 11/11/2000<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newscoast.com/headlinesstory2.cfm?ID=35115\">http://www.newscoast.com/headlinesstory2.cfm?ID=35115</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMr. President I look forward to your response.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely Yours,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Lederman, President of A.R.T.I.S.T.<br/>\n(Artists&#39; Response To Illegal State Tactics)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ARTISTpres@...\">ARTISTpres@...</a>  (718) 743-3722<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Baltech.org/lederman/spray/\">http://Baltech.org/lederman/spray/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS LETTER MAY BE FORWARDED OR REPRODUCED<br/>\nAS LONG AS THE CONTENT IS NOT ALTERED</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15704,"nextTopicId":15590}}
