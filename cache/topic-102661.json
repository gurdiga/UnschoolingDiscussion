We split the cost of the game and<br/>\nare splitting the cost of the monthly online charges.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I enjoy the game and play sporadically, Nick is *really* into<br/>\nit. None of his IRL friends are into it and he finds the online forums<br/>\ntoo impersonal. He&#39;d like to talk or email with someone, or several<br/>\nsomeones :o), who also are into this game. I&#39;m not into it enough for<br/>\nhim :o) Are any of your kids playing this? And would like to talk with<br/>\nNick about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nDiana Tashjian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34321,"nextTopicId":102596}}
