None of my mother&#39;s brothers and sisters were<br/>\never spanked, they were pulled out of p.s. when they complained (guess I<br/>\ncame by that one naturally &lt;g&gt;) about the treatment, and they were all<br/>\nallowed to follow their own interests regardless of gender.  My father was<br/>\nan only child and, quite frankly,<br/>\nspoiled rotten.  My stepdad had two brothers and he and they all grew up in<br/>\na &quot;relaxed&quot; house with few if any of the contraints that I continually hear<br/>\nfolks talking about during that era.  They also were allowed, even<br/>\nencouraged, to be individuals which probably explains why one is a Steve<br/>\nMcQueen look alike and keeps up with Jack LaLane (skin diving, motorcycle<br/>\nriding, sailing, weight-lifting still when he has passed the age of 70), was<br/>\na regional manager for a Fortune 500 company and a federal contractor who<br/>\nhas retired with all the toys, one is a pastor who uses his home as a<br/>\nshelter to raise abused children and one is a coupe driving and Harley<br/>\nriding biker who lives on a reservation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I have memories of horrible things that happened when I was a<br/>\nchild--when I was 3, some south end of a donkey deliberately swerved his car<br/>\nto hit and kill my dog not a yard from my feet.  I went to a school in one<br/>\nof the worst ghettos in the U.S.  I was discriminated against and racially<br/>\nharassed.  I saw my aunt beat up by her abusive, alcoholic husband and<br/>\nsubsequently die--I was there when she was given the last rites (age 5).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t *hang onto* those memories.

Walking with my<br/>\ngrandfather and climbing up to the top of the Carson Manson to see<br/>\n&quot;forever.&quot;  Grampa Harry always having rootbeer and ice cream in the fridge<br/>\nwhen I came to visit because that was my favorite.  Grampa Charlie spending<br/>\nhours and hours patiently teaching us how to fly fish (and believe me it<br/>\ntook patience to teach very small children to fly fish).  Gramma teaching us<br/>\nhow to make &quot;bread,&quot; telling us what a great job we did and only years later<br/>\nrealising that we didn&#39;t do anything but make a major mess in her kitchen.<br/>\nHaving teenage/early 20&#39;s uncles that took time out of their life to haul us<br/>\nlittle kids all over the place, play music for us and generally not treat us<br/>\nlike the<br/>\npests we really were.
