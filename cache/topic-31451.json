My name is Nicole Bybee.  I am married to the most wonderful Brad.  We live in Idaho.  We have seven wonderful sons ages 12 down to 16 months.<br/>\nWe have just been homeschooling/unschooling for just a little over a month...so we are VERY new to this...but enjoying it!<br/>\nAnyway, I hope to see this spat resolved soon.  So much more can be accomplished when we aren&#39;t trying to prove ourselves right and open our minds to a possibly new way to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31367,"nextTopicId":31388}}
