When we were talking to DS, we were talking about the<br/>\nconsequence of not paying the bills. He asked, &quot;what happens if we don&#39;t pay<br/>\nfor the house or lights?&quot; and I replied that &quot;The bank would eventually be<br/>\nforced to take the house away from us and the electric company would turn<br/>\nour lights off.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is not a statement of fact, it is a statement of judgmental emotion.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right and I am VERY sorry.

Not paying your bills on time can have<br/>\nserious repercussions that impact your credit rating. The first time you<br/>\nmiss a bill payment they can make a report to the credit bureau.

I  <br/>\ncan remember Gary drawing racing cars over and over when we were  <br/>\nkids. He restored an old Mustang convertible when we were teenagers.   <br/>\nHe became an auto technician (a 2-year degree) and worked for a long  <br/>\ntime for GM Performance Parts, the division that makes parts for  <br/>\nracing cars. Through that connection he met the eccentric millionaire  <br/>\nand ended up working for him. Now he&#39;s got his dream job and is as  <br/>\nhappy as a pig in sh-t. He&#39;s not a race car driver, which maybe would  <br/>\nhave been his first choice, but he&#39;s in the thick of things in a  <br/>\nprofession he has loved since he was a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 24, 2006, at 5:13 PM, nellebelle wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Having charge cards does not equal bad or less good behavior.   <br/>\n&gt; Charge cards<br/>\n&gt; are a financial tool. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] literal meaning of responsibility","postDate":"1140821891","msgId":112379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIyZC42ZmU1ZjgxLjMxMzBlOTgzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":112378,"nextInTopic":112380,"prevInTime":112378,"nextInTime":112380,"topicId":112353,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/24/2006 5:18:46 PM Eastern Standard Time,  nellebell ... cards are a financial  tool.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-105141073\">In a message dated 2/24/2006 5:18:46 PM Eastern Standard Time,  nellebell<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:e@...\">e@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Having charge cards does not equal bad or less good  behavior.

I would never  <br/>\ntell my kids such a thing because it makes the world seem scarier  <br/>\nthan it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family models better behavior in the area of clarity and  <br/>\ntruthfulness, maybe (by my gauge of those things).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your family doesn&#39;t model better behavior than mine does in  <br/>\npaying bills either.  Our bills are paid.  Even when Keith was in the  <br/>\nhospital, our bills were paid.  Had he been unconscious for any  <br/>\nlength of time I wouldn&#39;t have thought about utility bills for a  <br/>\nheartbeat, because I *know* from the experience of others around me  <br/>\nthat it will be two full months before they even threaten to turn off  <br/>\nutilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Not paying your bills on<br/>\ntime is not a calculated risk it is stupid.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a statement of fact, it is a statement of judgmental  <br/>\nemotion.

If you visit her website<br/>\nFlyLady.net, you will see what it is all about. She really helped me see<br/>\nthat housework didn&#39;t have to be all work and then my son saw me having fun<br/>\nand helps when he isn&#39;t sucked into other things. It is how he learned how<br/>\nto count, match socks, sort colors, measure soap and time the loads.

They can help if they want, but that that&#39;s<br/>\ntheir choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I have realized that housework stresses me out,<br/>\ntakes up too much of my time, and (surprise) I do not like it (Feeling<br/>\nguilty for &quot;making&quot; my kids do  their chores for so long and making<br/>\nthem feel bad and ashamed for &quot;not liking it.&quot;). I would much rather<br/>\nbe available to my daughters (4 and 9) or work on my school work<br/>\n(attending college) or writing a newsletter for my husband&#39;s    <br/>\nbusiness, exercising, or taking walks...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it has occured to me that we could hire someone to clean our house<br/>\nonce a week. My husband agrees. There is only one problem. To be able<br/>\nto pay for this, we would have to stop our weekly restaurant outings.<br/>\nIt&#39;s  OK with me and my husband. We are very interested in healthy<br/>\nnutrition and we are both negatively affected by sugar, flour,<br/>\nadditives etc. It would be easire for us to adhere to our chosen diet<br/>\nwithout the restaurant outings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I am anticipating that the girls will not like it.

Or maybe have <br/>\none &#39;upscale&#39; dinner out per month and go out for pizza, burgers, <br/>\nsandwiches/subs the other weeks.<br/>\n-Can you find other places to draw funds from? - maybe have fewer <br/>\nmeals with meat (if you eat meat to start with) since meats can be a <br/>\nbig chunk of $ in the grocery bill. <br/>\n-Instead of a &#39;full professional&#39; look around for high school or <br/>\ncollege students who would do the work either inexpensively or as <br/>\npart of a barter deal (they cleanthe bathroom and vacuum the living <br/>\nroom while they have a load of laundry in your washer)<br/>\n-look at your standards (individually and collectively) for the <br/>\nhouse and see if there are places that can get scaled back - for <br/>\ninstance, does the carpet need to be vacuumed daily? can you do the <br/>\ndusting twice a month instead of every other day? And so on. <br/>\nEveryone&#39;s perspective on what is necessary varies - if you&#39;ve folks <br/>\nwith allergies, then dusting and vacuuming are important and maybe <br/>\nit would be worthwhile to lose the carpet and get wood floors that <br/>\ncan be cleaned faster with just a broom (we&#39;ve just transitioned <br/>\nfrom carpet to hardwood and it&#39;s so much easier to manage one <br/>\nlightweight broom and start at the top of the house and sweep all <br/>\nthe way to the bottom and be done than it was to haul the vacuum <br/>\naround, plug, unplug, empty, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just a few items off the top of my head and I&#39;m sure you <br/>\nguys could probably brainstorm more as well - once you&#39;ve got a nice <br/>\nbig list, then make a decision.

I thought<br/>\nI would ask this question here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am starting to come around to the idea that the care of the house is<br/>\nmy job, not my kids&#39;. They can help if they want, but that that&#39;s<br/>\ntheir choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I have realized that housework stresses me out,<br/>\ntakes up too much of my time, and (surprise) I do not like it (Feeling<br/>\nguilty for &quot;making&quot; my kids do  their chores for so long and making<br/>\nthem feel bad and ashamed for &quot;not liking it.&quot;). I would much rather<br/>\nbe available to my daughters (4 and 9) or work on my school work<br/>\n(attending college) or writing a newsletter for my husband&#39;s    <br/>\nbusiness, exercising, or taking walks...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it has occured to me that we could hire someone to clean our house<br/>\nonce a week. My husband agrees. There is only one problem. To be able<br/>\nto pay for this, we would have to stop our weekly restaurant outings.<br/>\nIt&#39;s  OK with me and my husband. We are very interested in healthy<br/>\nnutrition and we are both negatively affected by sugar, flour,<br/>\nadditives etc. It would be easire for us to adhere to our chosen diet<br/>\nwithout the restaurant outings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I am anticipating that the girls will not like it. How do I make<br/>\nthis change without &quot;making&quot; them go along?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRenata</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112542,"nextTopicId":112545}}
