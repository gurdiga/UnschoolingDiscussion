He&#39;s a TV/Nintendo junkie and he also loves the computer, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want every gift to be a computer or Nintendo game.  He&#39;s taking ice <br/>\nskating lessons and group music classes.  He&#39;s always been interested in <br/>\nspace and aviation.  He still likes Pokemon.  He&#39;s a beginning reader, but <br/>\nvastly prefers being read to.  He does not like sports, or building things <br/>\nlike Legos.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?  Any particular games or toys your children have enjoyed?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12002,"nextTopicId":12030}}
