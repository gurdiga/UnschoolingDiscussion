Yes,<br/>\nI pulled the plug and cut him off.  I did the regulating.  I&#39;ve struggled<br/>\nmany times with whether that was the right decision, although it wasn&#39;t made<br/>\nlightly.  But we&#39;re doing a lot more things together.  I have a lot less<br/>\npersonal time, a lot less time when he plays alone, and I feel it.  It&#39;s<br/>\ntiring, emotionally for me.  But it&#39;s helping, and that&#39;s been<br/>\nwonderful.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou feel that what you did worked.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that pulling the<br/>\nplug was the ONLY possible solution.  What if you had asked him if you could<br/>\nwatch him play or play with him or ask him to explain the game to you?<br/>\n(maybe you have, I don&#39;t know)<br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this list a few years ago but have often been no mail because I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t keep up.  (guess I was self-regulating, huh?).  I came back<br/>\nrecently because I felt a need for more support and information on<br/>\nunschooling.  I thought I&#39;d been giving my children freedom in TV and food,<br/>\nbut reading here helped me to realize I wasn&#39;t, truly.  As a result of<br/>\nreading these posts, I&#39;ve been watching more TV with my kids.  I personally<br/>\ndon&#39;t watch much TV on my own, because I would rather be doing other things.<br/>\nMy husband watches TV every evening, and he loves to have any available<br/>\nfamily members cuddling on the couch with him while he&#39;s watching.  It does<br/>\nmake me uncomfortable to see my kids watching so much TV be I had bought<br/>\ninto reports on TV viewing that are based on kids who spend a lot of time in<br/>\nschool.  But over and over, I hear people on this list say that children<br/>\nwith NO limits WILL self regulate.  They don&#39;t say children with no limits<br/>\nuntil the parent can&#39;t stand it anymore and must set limits for the child&#39;s<br/>\nbenefit.  They don&#39;t say that children will self regulate within 24 hours.<br/>\nThey say that eventually, children with NO limits WILL self regulate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I could continue to set MY limits on the kids watching TV, or I<br/>\ncould join them, while also continuing to offer other opportunities for<br/>\nthings to do.  Joining them has enabled me to discuss what they are viewing<br/>\nwith them.  So, I am spending more time with the kids doing what they want<br/>\nto be doing at the moment, sharing THEIR interest of the moment with them.<br/>\nAnd it does impact my &quot;personal time&quot;, but if spending time with my kids is<br/>\none of my priorities, then what we are doing together should not be as<br/>\nimportant as the fact that we are together.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, 7yod was unhappy because she couldn&#39;t find anything she wanted<br/>\nto watch on TV.  I could have decided for her that it was time to turn it<br/>\noff.  Instead I spent time with her.  I helped her look through the channel<br/>\nguide.  I mentioned that she could do something else instead, but (I hope)<br/>\nin a way that made that ONE of her options.  I asked her questions about<br/>\nwhat type of show she wanted to watch - cartoon, animal, real people, etc.<br/>\nThen, when she did settle on something to watch, I stayed in the room and<br/>\nfolded laundry while watching with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far today, my kids have made valentine&#39;s for each other and mom and dad.<br/>\nThis was not my idea or suggestion.   They had bought valentine gifts for<br/>\neach other with their own money, neither one knowing that the other was<br/>\ndoing the same thing.  Again, this was not my idea or suggestion.  They took<br/>\na shower together and both washed their hair.  (OK, the hair washing was my<br/>\nsuggestion, but they could have said no and that would&#39;ve been OK too.  I<br/>\nreminded them how good they had got at washing their own hair in the shower<br/>\nin Mexico.)  The TV was on for a few minutes, but it is off now.  They<br/>\ndidn&#39;t even watch a complete show.  Now they are playing with wooden dolls<br/>\nthat have separate heads and bodies.  Jackie got her set out first.  Lisa<br/>\nwanted to play, but Jackie would only let her use the sad faces.  They were<br/>\nstarting to get mad at each other, so I stepped in.  I said I heard that<br/>\nLisa didn&#39;t want to play unless she could have a happy face, and that it was<br/>\nOK for Jackie to choose not to give her a happy face, but it would mean that<br/>\nJackie would have to accept playing by herself.  (Those weren&#39;t my exact<br/>\nwords, but that&#39;s the jist).  I also reminded them that Lisa also has her<br/>\nown set of the dolls that are a bit different.  They got excited and decided<br/>\nto play with both sets, sharing and mix-matching the pieces.  Things could<br/>\nhave ended differently, but this time, it worked that I stopped what I was<br/>\ndoing to be with them and help them work something out (techniques well<br/>\ndescribed in How to Talk So Kids Will Listen).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart is also lighter about my household chores since reading some<br/>\nthoughtful posts here.  Why will my kids want to do chores if I&#39;m grumbling<br/>\nabout them?  I have a certain standard of how I want my house to look.  So<br/>\nI&#39;m working on that, without making it their problem.  And they are doing<br/>\nsome tasks without me asking them to.  Thanks again to the women on the list<br/>\nwho are taking the time to repeat and repeat.  I am not yet where I want to<br/>\nbe, but I am where I am, and it&#39;s really good most of the time!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58882,"nextTopicId":58894}}
