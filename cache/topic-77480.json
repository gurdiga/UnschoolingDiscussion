For some, the above is true. For others, not so<br/>\nmuch. Just like Pam&#39;s post talked about how each of her girls needed<br/>\nsomething different when they melted down, the same can be true of reasons<br/>\nto have a tantrum. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my kids almost never lost it and when she did wanted close contact<br/>\nwith me. One lost it very often, not because he wasn&#39;t listened to, just<br/>\nwent straight to it. He wanted no contact, no talking. That&#39;s the beauty of<br/>\nmindful parenting, giving each child what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77454,"nextTopicId":77482}}
