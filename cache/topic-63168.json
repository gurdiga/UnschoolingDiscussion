I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-89229611\">Just thought I would write a little about myself and<br/>\nmy kids, since I have been reading the messeges for<br/>\nabout a week now.  I have two kids, ages 5 and 2.  I<br/>\nstarted homeschooling the oldest last year.  He went<br/>\nthrough the Kingergarden curriculum in a flash.  (Some<br/>\nof you might know or remember me from the messege<br/>\nboards)  When I tried to start some harder stuff with<br/>\nhim, he ended up hating the school activies.  And part<br/>\nof it was my fault of course.  I probably pushed him<br/>\ntoo hard and expected too much from him.  So I have<br/>\ndropped the school work for the rest of the year and<br/>\nsummer at least.  I guess I will decide after that<br/>\nwhat to do.  I was planning on doing this virtual<br/>\ncharter school with him next year, but we will wait<br/>\nand see.  I do not know why I feel such a need to<br/>\n&#39;teach him&#39;.  It is not like he has any problems<br/>\nlearning on his own.  He has pretty much taught<br/>\nhimself how to read.  I bought the hooked on phonics<br/>\nprogram, but that seemed to bore him and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nlong before he was reading words not even on that at<br/>\nhis level.  So lately I have been letting them both do<br/>\npretty much what they want.  I do sometimes initiate<br/>\nactivities, but I never make either of them do<br/>\nanything anymore.  I hardest part for me has been me<br/>\nnot feeling bad because I feel like I am not doing<br/>\nenough.  Also, sometimes it is hard for me to get<br/>\ninvolved in what they are doing.  So I have been<br/>\ntrying to do one thing with them a day.  Like play a<br/>\ngame or watch a movie or something like that.  And<br/>\nsometimes it is hard for me to pay attention to<br/>\neverything the oldest is saying to me.  He talks non<br/>\nstop sometimes, but I am getting much better at<br/>\nstopping what I am doing and looking at him and<br/>\nresponding to him.  Anyway, I guess this has gotten<br/>\nlong enough.  My main point being that this has been<br/>\nas much of a learning experience to me as it has been<br/>\nfor them.  And I think I am stating to relate better<br/>\nwith my oldest son.<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

(One of my avid joys is teaching others<br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is a little different.  I was way too hands-off when Lars was<br/>\nyounger.  I thought you just set up a house with interesting stuff and the<br/>\nkid eventually picked it up.  Trouble is, I set up the house to be the<br/>\nperfect unschooling house . . . for me.  Lars never picked up any of those<br/>\nbooks I left around.  That&#39;s not how he learns.  (I had still thought that<br/>\nhe would learn from books once he learned to read . . .not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now it&#39;s much harder to &quot;insert&quot; myself back into his life.  Being 15,<br/>\nhe&#39;s not all that keen for me to do that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, I take it from that that they are not *really* bored or that boredom<br/>\n </span></blockquote>is not the reason they are playing those games.  But what they say and what<br/>\nthey do send confusing messages to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one that&#39;s familiar to me.  Lars talks about wanting to do more<br/>\nacademic stuff, but I realize now that&#39;s his friends and society talking,<br/>\nnot him.  He had said he wanted to go for a diploma through the program he&#39;s<br/>\nregistered with.  I agreed to help him even though I don&#39;t think he needs<br/>\n(or really wants) a diploma.  Just the other day he finally admitted that<br/>\nhe&#39;d like a diploma but doesn&#39;t want to sit down and do the work involved.<br/>\nSo now we&#39;re concentrating more on the kinds of things he might like to do<br/>\nas he gets older and what the minimum requirements might be.  For instance,<br/>\na lot of vocational programs at the community college here only have<br/>\nrequirements for certain courses, like a certain math level.  I&#39;m sure we<br/>\ncan find a way to document what he knows in those areas without his actually<br/>\ntaking a course in them.  So we&#39;re making some progress.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems like a tough balance to introduce new things and also to step<br/>\n </span></blockquote>back and wait for what they might show an interest in.  Its also tought to<br/>\n&quot;get on it&quot; in the midst of an already busy life.  How do you do it and<br/>\nmaintain that healthy balance?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I have a hard time with is getting used to lots of time to<br/>\ndo my thing when he doesn&#39;t want my involvement, then making the switch to<br/>\nhelping him when I&#39;m in the middle of something of my own.  When he wants to<br/>\ndo something, he wants to do it now.  I&#39;ve put him off till later enough<br/>\ntimes to know that he&#39;ll just lose interest in whatever it was by the time I<br/>\nget around to it.  So I have been working on getting around to it sooner.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an easy balance for me.  I do best at getting my own stuff<br/>\n(writing, housework, etc.) done when it&#39;s part of a routine.  When my<br/>\nroutine gets interrupted, it&#39;s hard for me to get back to it.  But that&#39;s my<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] about time, and involvement, and older kids","postDate":"1049678602","msgId":63209,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmYwMWMyZmNhNCQ0ODE4YjRkMCQ3YjdlNTI0NEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFlOC42MGI1ZWU5LjJiYzFmNjE4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":63206,"nextInTopic":63400,"prevInTime":63208,"nextInTime":63210,"topicId":63168,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The longer people go the deeper the parental involvement/knowledge/connection becomes even when the kids aren t even physically present.

Do you ever feel like you&#39;re slacking off, even if your kids seem happy?  Or maybe I&#39;m just feeling guilty for not &quot;teaching&quot;.  (One of my avid joys is teaching others &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my kids sometimes say that they are bored and thats why they are on the computer so much.  Yet, when there ARE friends here, they are STILL on the computer playing the same games.  I have to suggest to them that they have visitors and perhaps they should either share the game or go do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I take it from that that they are not *really* bored or that boredom is not the reason they are playing those games.  But what they say and what they do send confusing messages to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an avid reader.  I love to read.  I explore most of my own interests through reading, online, in books, or on TV.  I&#39;m online a lot, or I used to be before 3 kids took it over &lt;grin&gt;.  I used to feel guilty about enjoying tv movies, and online chat, but not anymore.  I LOVE a good story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe computer is my doorway to the whole wide world and I find it so exciting.  When my kids are online chatting and calling friends from other states, etc...sometimes I worry that my example is hurting them.  Are they spending *too* much time online...etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow I feel like I&#39;m not broadening their horizons enough.  I&#39;m very interested in the SCA, but I can&#39;t seem to get started...its a lot of information at once, or it seems like it is.  (I think I need to contact the right person..I forget who it is but I&#39;ll double check).  Maybe if I had one person who could walk me through the process....(sigh).  I know my kids would probably love the SCA, at least my girls would.   We have a Renaissance Fair here every year...and we&#39;ve never been there. I hope to get there this year.  They recently went to see the play Camelot with my mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we are very involved in Girl Scouts which has helped a lot for my girls, but that doesn&#39;t help my son.   He&#39;s into wiring, technical theater etc...I&#39;m just not quite sure how to make the contacts and then the days get away from me and it seems like it slips away.  Major guilt trip on mom here.   Does that happen to you guys?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like a tough balance to introduce new things and also to step back and wait for what they might show an interest in.  Its also tought to &quot;get on it&quot; in the midst of an already busy life.  How do you do it and maintain that healthy balance?<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 06, 2003 5:28 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] about time, and involvement, and older kids<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/6/03 3:00:26 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; I think people should spend at least as much time with their kids as the <br/>\n  time <br/>\n  the kids would have been in school.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a question about this.
