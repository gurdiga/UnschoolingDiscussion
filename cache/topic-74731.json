B vitamins - The B vitamins, especially folic acid and vitamin B6, help support the clearing of the stress hormones by the liver.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  b.. St. John&#39;s Wort - St. John&#39;s Wort is an herbal remedy that has been used in Europe as a treatment for mild depression. It should not be taken with antidepressant medications, especially SSRI&#39;s like Prozac or Celexa, anti-retroviral medications or birth control pills.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  c.. Fish oil - Recent preliminary studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil may be helpful in helping to maintain a healthy mind.  We think that reasonable doses of fish oil supplements might be useful with mild temporary depression. Fish oil is an excellent source of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the most common fatty acid in nerve and brain tissue.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  d..

I think it&#39;s all about the $$$$. People take it, and <br/>\n  have so many problems stopping it, that they keep on taking it <br/>\n  because they feel crazy when they don&#39;t. Crazier than they were to <br/>\n  begin with. The manufacturers say it&#39;s not addictive. I did research <br/>\n  at the website to see about the side effects, but i relied on the <br/>\n  manufacturer&#39;s word. I wished i had found quitpaxil.org and <br/>\n  paxilprogress.org beforehand. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So yeah, i&#39;m an idiot. Too proud to need medication, too strong to <br/>\n  not fight this on my own. I talked to very few people about it, no <br/>\n  one understood when I did. I got laughed at, dismissed, looked at <br/>\n  weird. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m discussing it now. Maybe this is the first <br/>\n  I have really felt comfortable discussing things with people that <br/>\n  most other people don&#39;t understand. <br/>\n<br/>\n  After the paxil incident, i trust antidepressents even less.

I fought myself for years to ever take any kind <br/>\nof pill for my depression. I don&#39;t think I took the prozac long <br/>\nenough to really get any kind of benefit from it, i felt silly taking <br/>\nit so I stopped. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Seems to me a couple of things.

I think it&#39;s all about the $$$$. People take it, and <br/>\nhave so many problems stopping it, that they keep on taking it <br/>\nbecause they feel crazy when they don&#39;t. Crazier than they were to <br/>\nbegin with. The manufacturers say it&#39;s not addictive. I did research <br/>\nat the website to see about the side effects, but i relied on the <br/>\nmanufacturer&#39;s word. I wished i had found quitpaxil.org and <br/>\npaxilprogress.org beforehand. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, i&#39;m an idiot. Too proud to need medication, too strong to <br/>\nnot fight this on my own. I talked to very few people about it, no <br/>\none understood when I did. I got laughed at, dismissed, looked at <br/>\nweird. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m discussing it now. Maybe this is the first <br/>\nI have really felt comfortable discussing things with people that <br/>\nmost other people don&#39;t understand. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the paxil incident, i trust antidepressents even less.

I just got done in january of <br/>\nthis year, 2003. I was prescribed in nov of 2001. I was only given a <br/>\nsix month prescription. Do the math LOL. I had a history of PPD with <br/>\nmy second child, and was given a sample of Prozac. I didn&#39;t do more <br/>\nthan a month with that and thought I was fine. Well with number three <br/>\nchild, he was 3 months old, sept 11th happened, and a baby on the <br/>\nmessage board born at the same time died of a heart problem. And the <br/>\nlady in texas in the news who drowned her children. I thought there <br/>\nmust be more to life than being tormented and miserable for no <br/>\nlogical reason. I went to the doc and she said you have a choice, and <br/>\nI said paxil because i saw commercials that paxil handles depression <br/>\nand anxiety. I am suspectible to both. I didn&#39;t research it, and <br/>\nstarted taking it. I went back a week later and told the doc of weird <br/>\nsymptoms, she dismissed them. Several months later I had my husband <br/>\nand SIL over because I thought I was going crazy. I didn&#39;t take it <br/>\nstraight as dosed for more than a month. But every time I tried to <br/>\nquit, I got horrible brain zaps and dizziness. They called my doc, <br/>\nand she said oh you can&#39;t just quit, do half a pill every day for a <br/>\nweek and half a pill every other day for a week, and you will be <br/>\nfine. NOPE! I was doing half a pill every four or five days for <br/>\nmonths, because the withdrawals kept coming back over and over. It <br/>\nwas hell. Finally i read somewhere (quitpaxil.org?) that taking <br/>\nprozac while withdrawing really helps, so i found my sample in the <br/>\nlinen closet from my second child PPD, and took it for ten days. It <br/>\ndid the trick. It wasn&#39;t easy, but easy enough for me to finally be <br/>\ndone with it. They don&#39;t call it Pax-hell for nothing. I hope you are <br/>\nsuccessful getting off of it in 21 days, if not, feel free to contact <br/>\nme offlist!
