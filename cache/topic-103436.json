She just never thought it was a model she wanted to follow. But, after the conference she told me, should she have children she absolutely knew she would choose unschooling.

And it&#39;s been hard for me NOT to, but I don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had no curfew, so it was *really* easy for me not to enforce curfews----oe even consider them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a little child, I was made to attend church and Sunday school---and in high school was VERY into church and religion. Atheist now, but my son is looking into Buddhism and reading/asking a little of the bible (though I think teenhood is a natural &#39;age&#39; for researching spirituality and religion). I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;d be VERY surprised to find him in the Baptist or Catholic or *any* church, but I guess it&#39;s not an impossibility. But too---that&#39;s not something that&#39;s important to me, so I wouldn&#39;t really care that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parenting thing IS. Yes, I *would* be disappointed if he put his kids in school, spanked, or were just plain unkind to his babies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose horrible teens years that we were warned about for the first 13 years of our son&#39;s life have NOT come true. I guess his easy personality has something to do with it---but I think the parenting and the unschooling have a whole bunch to do with pleasant teen years. I have no doubts that he&#39;ll be a gentler, kinder parent than I have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s that rubber band thing: the tighter they&#39;re pulled, the further they&#39;ll fly. YES! I&#39;LL SAY IT: I can&#39;t imagine mine would fly that far! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, I know that A doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to B---but I think we can come closer and closer and closer with the unschooling philosophy than with anything else anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] second generation was ap and unschooling","postDate":"1108560797","msgId":103470,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOS41NmNhYzdhMS4yZjQ0YTU5ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":103469,"nextInTopic":103473,"prevInTime":103469,"nextInTime":103471,"topicId":103436,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/16/2005 6:35:30 AM Central Standard Time, game-enthusiast@adelphia.net writes: I have a  really hard time picturing my children choosing a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-95533144\">In a message dated 2/16/2005 6:35:30 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a  really hard time picturing my children choosing a completely<br/>\ndifferent  parenting route than I have taken. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nThis is exactly what I&#39;m talking about.

We&#39;re encouraging free thought----and deep thought---on all subjects, even those we may disagree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even if Cameron were to become Baptist or---or a teacher! &lt;g&gt; I think he would do it with a lot of thought and reflection, NOT &#39;just because&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the conference helps here too. (PlugPlugPlug!) New unschooling moms may seem a little &#39;out there&#39; to their kids (and I guess we ARE when compared to the mainstream). But when children see that there are LOTS more like them in the world, that mom&#39;s not a total nut, that this philosophy is really out there and works for others----then I think it&#39;s more likely to take hold. When they see other children---who are not in school, but are smart and joyful and love to learn---who are interested and interesting. And then when they compare *those* children to their schooled friends. And when they see *older* unschoolers who are so full of life and not drained and struggling, *I* think that *they* think a little bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron didn&#39;t participate in the first two conferences (that were held HERE), but he really enjoyed himself last year. Made several very cool friends and *listened* to most of the presenters. He&#39;s a convert now! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about it a lot---his local friends are all still in school. They&#39;re miserable. He can see that and appreciate his lot now. That makes a pretty deep impression. (I don&#39;t know how Duncan will react, having never been to school and having few schooled friends---that could make a difference!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron was out in Albuquerque last week visiting Sandra and her family. He got to see it working big time out there too. We&#39;ll be in Jacksonville in a week on our way to Disneyworld and will stay with Gail and her family. I think those experiences are valuable---to see that others treat their kids respectfully too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND I think that that could be the problem with the kids (like us) who were spanked and schooled and Sunday-schooled to death: we got out there in the &#39;real world&#39; and saw that not everyone IS like that! What a concept! *Some* people are NICE to their kids! Damn!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we talk about it enough and SHOW it enough, that our kids will be more thoughtful. I think they will choose the better  (and better and better) choices BECAUSE they CAN: they&#39;ve had that experience for a long time: free choice. And their choices were respected, even when we didn&#39;t totally agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m as cynical-----REALISTIC----as you, Tuck, but I really think that the foundation of trust and respect WON&#39;T come back to bite us in the butts. I think our kids may go even further---be kinder and more trustful and more respectful than we could ever have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it in Cameron already. I just got a postcard yesterday that read: &quot;Unschooling ROCKS!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m probably  too cynical, but I prefer the term realistic.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah----but realistically-speaking: given the choice to harm another or not: what would Will choose? To allow someone else free choice or not: what would Will choose? To rear a child with trust and respect or to demand obedience: what would Will choose?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m cynical as hell about most of humankind. But my own kids? I think they are remarkably way ahead of me on this journey. I think they will make better choices---they already *have*!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74921799,"authorName":"Deborah Harper","from":"&quot;Deborah Harper&quot; &lt;debbliz@...&gt;","profile":"debbliz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] second generation was ap and unschooling","postDate":"1108473297","msgId":103446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTMwMWM1MTM2MCQ1OTJmZjMzMCQ4MjAyYThjMEBkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlmLjU4Yzc4YWEwLjJmNDM0ZGE5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103440,"nextInTopic":103457,"prevInTime":103445,"nextInTime":103447,"topicId":103436,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ahhhh.... isn t that a fear we all entertain sometimes?

But you know, there are many many 2nd generation-ers that offer examples of this not happening.  No we haven&#39;t seen it all yet, but there are at least lots of 20-something year olds that I know that were raised at least AP if not unschooled that are incredibly feeling compassionate people.  I am hopeful that at least a larger number of them will not rebel.  I think rebellion is about teenage angst and I just don&#39;t see that in these children or in this philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, February 15, 2005 8:05 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] second generation was ap and unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another topic:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I believe every generation believes they&#39;re doing it &quot;right&quot;, and that  <br/>\n  they&#39;re not doing it &quot;like they&#39;re parents did&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  There are going to be plenty (too many) of unschooled kids who grow up and  <br/>\n  become conservative Christians and raise their kids on Baby Wise and send  them <br/>\n  to school.  :::patooey:::<br/>\n<br/>\n  How many of us were raised in church and no longer go?
