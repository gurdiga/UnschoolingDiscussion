Where Kirby goes, the kids have to sign an <br/>\nagreement concerning behavior and intent.  They won&#39;t take a child against <br/>\nthe child&#39;s will (so they wouldn&#39;t be able to sell gift memberships to <br/>\nnot-yet-members/students).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome schools stress tournaments and competitions and others don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome are more interested in character building than in butt-kicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say without even leaving the house you could read the ads in the <br/>\nyellow pages--how do the schools present themselves?  You&#39;ll note differences <br/>\nright away.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could look on line for overall descriptions of the philosophies of <br/>\ndifferent associations.  Many times local schools are affiliated with one or <br/>\nanother national or international association.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a local martial-arts supply house in town (like a store that <br/>\nsells gear for the different sports) you might ask the purveyor (who is <br/>\nlikely also a martial arts teacher) about the differences in the types of <br/>\nmartial arts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing you could do as it&#39;s a gift would be to promise to pay for lessons <br/>\nand a good uniform.  In some schools you can get the basic cheap uniform <br/>\nwhich will be cotton/polyester blend, or you can opt for a better all-cotton <br/>\nuniform.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23619,"nextTopicId":23571}}
