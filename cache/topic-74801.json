Aren&#39;t  they all equal?   .. sorry,  I couldn&#39;t resist.  OH.. <br/>\nto make this post more than just a one liner.. I will add my own experience <br/>\nwith AD medications.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken paxil for over 10 years... probably closer to 12.   My <br/>\nneurologist prescribed it along with Inderal LA 80mg to help prevent migraine <br/>\nheadaches.  My ha&#39;s are very cyclic and I also have  PMS..  That combination of <br/>\nmedication, along with imitrex nasal spray, IF I happen to get a severe headache, has <br/>\ncontrolled my migraines very well.   Every few years, I build up a tolerance <br/>\nto the Inderal and I have to switch to another beta blocker.    I usually <br/>\nsuffer for several months with  headaches, and no other beta blocker works as well <br/>\nas the Inderal.  Usually after I have been off of Inderal for 9-12 mos, I can <br/>\ngo back to it with much success.   I asked my Dr once about going off of the <br/>\npaxil, he asked me &quot;why?&quot;... I really didnt have an answer.. uhmm.. &quot;because I <br/>\ndont want to take medication all of my life?.. uhhh, because I dont really <br/>\nthink it &quot;does&quot; anything for me?&quot;  He replied.. &quot;You are not the one who can <br/>\ntell if the paxil &quot;does&quot; anything for you.. (smile from Dr).. The folks AROUND <br/>\nyou are the ones who can tell, ask your husband if he can tell a difference from <br/>\nwhen you didnt take the paxil&quot;  OK.. point taken.  :-) ..  I do have to be <br/>\ncareful and not miss a dose.   Missing one dose is only mildly affecting.. <br/>\nmissing  two.. much more noticeable.  On the rare occasion I miss 3 does ( like <br/>\nrunning out and continually forgetting to get it refilled) .. its BAD NEWS.     <br/>\nNot good at all.  I know if I do ever go off the paxil, I will have to be <br/>\nweaned off it of slowly and carefully.   But, as long as I keep my headaches and my <br/>\nPMS under control, I do not expect to stop taking it<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74089,"nextTopicId":74804}}
