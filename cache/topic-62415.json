It is healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has had a difficult time coming to terms with his childhood.  <br/>\nHe loves his mother and he took care of his father when he was suffering<br/>\nand dying from Alzheimer&#39;s disease.    He is a good son.<br/>\nIf he admits to himself his parents didn&#39;t do the best they could have<br/>\nfor him he&#39;s disrespecting them.   If he tries to be a better father than<br/>\nhis father was he&#39;s admitting that things weren&#39;t right at his home.  If<br/>\nhe admit&#39;s that, he can&#39;t continue to see his mother in the same light<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t defend and protect him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s complicated and he really resented that I would defend our son if he<br/>\nwas upset with him.  He wasn&#39;t angry at me, he was angry at his own mom,<br/>\nwho didn&#39;t defend him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is a much better parent than his father was and is beginning to heal<br/>\nsome.  He is mindful and considerate and when he makes a mistake he can<br/>\napologize for it.   It&#39;s harder maybe because his father is gone and<br/>\nthere is no way for them to clear the air now.  His mother is nearly<br/>\neighty, and alone, he feels like any conversation with her now might be<br/>\ndamaging to her.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHealing takes time but every little minute you can make better choices<br/>\nand be more mindful.   And when you see your child&#39;s happiness, really<br/>\nbelieve she deserves it and that you did too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a post last year at unschooling.com Sandra shared a letter she&#39;d<br/>\nwritten to a cousin who&#39;s father had just died.

I personally haven&#39;t taken it as meanness (most of the time, though there have been a few borderline<br/>\ncomments here and there).  As I was thinking about this today, I  started to equate the personalities here to aspect of the Goddess.  There are those Goddesses who present a soft, gentle and loving<br/>\naspect of the divine (Kwan Yin, Sophia), there are those who are the destroyers of illusions who are anything but gentle (Kali), there are the nurturing earth mothers (Pachamama) and many more.  All of<br/>\nthese aspects of the divine are represented in the voices on this list.  I feel like I know when I open posts by different poeple that I am going to probably be given one or another of these<br/>\ninterpretations on any given topic.  That&#39;s OK but sometimes it is a whole lot easier to hear things when they are said with loving, caring words.  That doesn&#39;t mean that those who cut to the quick are<br/>\nnot loving, caring people.  They just have their own way of expressing it and that way is absolutely appropriate and valid too.  It&#39;s just an awareness;  you could all be saying the same thing but the<br/>\ntone with which it is said will resonate with some and not with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi R</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6121707,"authorName":"Jana Eagle","from":"Jana Eagle &lt;jana@...&gt;","profile":"jana_eagle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] plug in drug conversation","postDate":"1049063965","msgId":62465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2ZDZrODhvbzIuZnNmQGh1Z28uRklHPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFODcxQzNBLjUxMTA3RkVDQGNhcGl0YWwubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFjMC43NjcwYWY3LjJiYjg2NDZiQGNzLmNvbT4gPDNFODcxQzNBLjUxMTA3RkVDQGNhcGl0YWwubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":62450,"nextInTopic":62470,"prevInTime":62464,"nextInTime":62466,"topicId":62415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"yes, thanks ren from me too for re-posting all those old messages that you wrote on the list a couple of years ago.  i read them all and it was really helpful","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1053138611\">yes, thanks ren from me too for re-posting all those old messages that<br/>\nyou wrote on the list a couple of years ago.  i read them all and it<br/>\nwas really helpful for me to see where you are coming from.  it sounds<br/>\nlike i am in the same place you were.<br/>\n<br/>\nsorry if i have missed replying to many of the posts you all have<br/>\nwritten to me.  this is such a busy list, but i am reading it all.<br/>\nlet&#39;s just say that i have had my world turned upside down in the last<br/>\nfew days, ok?<br/>\n<br/>\ni have major communication problems with my family of origin, and up<br/>\nuntil a few days ago, i was blaming the television for it.  every<br/>\nnight we would all sit in front of the tv, absorbed in the sitcoms,<br/>\nand when the tv wasn&#39;t taking over our life, i would be subjecting to<br/>\nteasing and coersion (basically).  i think my family put up a good<br/>\nfront that everything was okay but i wanted to do different things<br/>\nthan my sisters and brother, i would have thrived if i were permitted<br/>\nto stay at home and draw all day.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni accept that i can have a good relationship with my<br/>\ndaughter while including her interests like tv and computer games.<br/>\n<br/>\nand i accept that i will probably not have a trusting relationship<br/>\nwith her if i am preventing her from doing something that she likes<br/>\n(watching tv).<br/>\n<br/>\nso if i have as my goal to be an unschooler, and to be available to my<br/>\ndaughter to explore life with her, just wondering what do i do about<br/>\nmy anger?  there are so many things i feel i missed out on when i was<br/>\na kid-- i saw tv as the culprit but i can accept that it was only a<br/>\nscapegoat-- and i think i force myself too much to be the strong one<br/>\nwhen i don&#39;t feel very in control.  no easy answers, but i thought i&#39;d<br/>\nask anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\njana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi and Brent Ricks &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rickshei@...\">rickshei@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that you care deeply for your children...that is very evident.

(Yeah, I like the comics!):<br/>\nA zen master stands before a student and the student asks, What is the <br/>\nmeaning of life?  The zen master thumps him on the head with a stick.  The <br/>\nnext day, the same thing happens.  And so on.  And so on.  One day, the <br/>\nstudent doesn&#39;t need to ask and you see the student and master smiling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think this example was incredibly cruel.  Why didn&#39;t the master <br/>\nexplain the meaning of life?  It would have been so easy and painless for <br/>\nthem both!  After many, many years of thinking of this story, I finally <br/>\nrealized.  The student *couldn&#39;t* grow in understanding until he had gotten <br/>\npast the expectations, the false presumptions of how &#39;growing in <br/>\nunderstanding&#39; works.  The master was wacking him to try and help him &#39;wake <br/>\nup&#39;, to get him upset enough that he would begin to question his own <br/>\npresumptions, his own prejudices and perspectives... to release them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list, and another I am on, are like that zen master.  Thumping folks <br/>\non the head, to help them wake up to awareness, to help them realize that <br/>\nthey need to look past their presumptions and prejudices.  (not that we <br/>\nshould run around thwacking the searchers with sticks, eh?  A little truth, <br/>\nyes.)  I occasionally get thumped, and thank goodness for it.  Sometimes, I <br/>\ncall a little truth and someone else is &#39;thumped&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWake Up!

I don&#39;t use scare tactics, <br/>\nI try to stick with facts. An occasional soda is unlikely to harm anyone <br/>\nunless they&#39;re diabetic or something. As much as I think it&#39;s harmful, I do <br/>\nthink they are capable of choosing for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of my children were really interested in a particular movie, I would <br/>\nfind a way to make it work....either by warning them of potentially <br/>\ndisturbing scenes or helping them edit to their satisfaction.<br/>\nI have a 13 y.o. that will not watch rated R. He tells people &quot;I can&#39;t watch <br/>\nrated R&quot;, I questioned him on this since I don&#39;t tell him he can&#39;t. His <br/>\nanswer was &quot;It&#39;s true Mom, I didn&#39;t say YOU wouldn&#39;t let me, I said I can&#39;t <br/>\nwatch them. I&#39;m not ready for rated R yet&quot;<br/>\nDh and I have tried to get him to watch Braveheart with us, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel ready for that intense of a movie yet!! He knows himself. I&#39;m very glad <br/>\nfor that....a level of self knowing he couldn&#39;t have gained if I&#39;d continued <br/>\nto be controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot forbidding things doesn&#39;t mean &quot;hands off&quot; in any way. We are there, <br/>\nguiding with information and being a safety net for our children. That is WAY <br/>\ndifferent than someone that only provides unhealthy food, overly intense <br/>\nmovies and then leaves a child to themselves.<br/>\nMy children are surrounded by lots and lots of choices. And they make the <br/>\nchoices that are best for them at any given moment. It&#39;s cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: plug in drug conversation","postDate":"1048994002","msgId":62415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzI5LjIwMTMyMi4xODU2LjkuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":62436,"prevInTime":62414,"nextInTime":62416,"topicId":62415,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I m sure I ll be blasted again with anything I say *** We are not interested in blasting you.

We&#39;re interested in discussing<br/>\nunschooling ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***There&#39;s got to be a rabble rouser in every crowd ***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo there really doesn&#39;t.   You&#39;re being funny maybe but coming here to<br/>\nraise heck doesn&#39;t seem beneficial to anyone, least of all you.<br/>\n<br/>\n***When I said that if anyone wants to watch TV then they have to be<br/>\nwilling to be away from the rest of the family, that was sometimes true<br/>\nbut what usually happens is that this means we all watch TV<br/>\ntogether.  This would not happen if the tv was elsewhere.  If it was in<br/>\nthe livingroom, we would keep on doing other activities and not tune in<br/>\nto what is on the tube.  I see this happen at my mil&#39;s all the time.  She<br/>\nturns it on and walks away and they end up watching some really<br/>\ninappropriate (in my opinion) things.  We like to watch with the kids so<br/>\nwe can talk about what they are seeing.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis makes absolutely no sense.<br/>\nYou keep the TV away from family life because if it was where you could<br/>\nall see it, it might not get watched?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we understood the first time.    You banished the TV and anyone<br/>\ninterested in it to the basement with cold disregard to the needs of the<br/>\nother members of the household.    They may learn to regard your<br/>\ninterests and needs in the same manner.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I was raised without a tv for my entire childhood and I thank my<br/>\nparents for making that decision.  I know I would have spent many hours<br/>\non my butt watching idiotic shows and commercials***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t know that because it was never an option for you.   If you had<br/>\nchosen TV it would have been your choice and not the TV&#39;s.  You get to<br/>\ntake responsibility for that.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I want my kids outside rather than in front of some mindless show.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about what your kids want?    Is part of the reason you&#39;re<br/>\nunschooling to help your kids do what they want?    <br/>\n<br/>\n***Kids need to know there are boundries and that those bounderies will<br/>\nmove as they are ready.  I know kids who have never had boundries<br/>\nwith their parents.  They are allowed to have coke and cookies for<br/>\nbreakfast adn watch r rated movies at age 6.  This doesn&#39;t serve the<br/>\nchild in the long run as they feel so alone in their decision making. <br/>\nThere is no one to fall back on, to get advice from. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, if a coke and cookies are ok after lunch then their ok anytime.<br/>\n  They don&#39;t magically change to Drano if you eat them in the morning.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s exactly the same thing no matter what time of day it&#39;s consumed.  <br/>\nNow, if you&#39;re entirely against coke and cookies that&#39;s another matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re new to unschooling and don&#39;t completely understand the<br/>\ndifference between it and neglect.    Unschooling is NOT neglect.   <br/>\nUnschooling parents are profoundly involved in their children&#39;s lives, <br/>\nhelping and supporting  and offering experience.    They are interested<br/>\nin keeping their kids safe and helping their children achieve their<br/>\npersonal goals.   They are NOT interested in forcing children to meet the<br/>\nparents goals and expectations.    Unschooled children know they can come<br/>\nto their parents for ANY reason, ANY help, with ANY question or problem<br/>\nor inspiration or joy and their needs will be met.   Unschooling parents<br/>\nbecome adept at anticipating their children&#39;s needs and inspirations and<br/>\njoys and do what they can to help fulfill them.   It is total<br/>\ninvolvement, not lack of involvement.   Total interest in the lives and<br/>\nwell being of their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou didn&#39;t really mean to imply we are neglectful did you?   You didn&#39;t<br/>\nreally imagine we have not given this long thought and consideration and<br/>\nmuch research?   You didn&#39;t imagine we haven&#39;t seen with our own eyes the<br/>\nhealth and joy in our children because of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62546,"nextTopicId":62561}}
