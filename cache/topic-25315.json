I researched the charter school and<br/>\n&gt; after<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on<br/>\nus.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the<br/>\ncharterschool<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last<br/>\n&gt; &quot;school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neglect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the<br/>\nhouse<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school<br/>\ninformation,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together.<br/>\n&gt; Although<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neighbors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desguised<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some<br/>\n&gt; charters<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do<br/>\n&gt; engage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Educational<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn<br/>\nover<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anythign<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all.

I researched the charter school and<br/>\nafter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on us.<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the charterschool<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specialist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that.

This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone.

The policeman came out, took down our school information,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; checked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger.

I researched the charter school and after<br/>\n&gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to other homeschoolers we decided to go ahead and sign up with the<br/>\ncharter<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school as they provided us protection if/when CPS was called on us. I<br/>\n&gt; believe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it was the day after we signed the paperwork with the charterschool I<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; CPS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; call me on the phone saying someone called them to report that my<br/>\nchildren<br/>\n&gt; do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not go to school. I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>\n&gt; Specialist<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last &quot;school<br/>\n&gt; year&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>\n&gt; neighbors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>\n&gt; eventually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I had<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child<br/>\nneglect<br/>\n&gt; &gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the house<br/>\n&gt; &gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school information,<br/>\n&gt; checked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as we<br/>\nwere<br/>\n&gt; &gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we<br/>\ndo,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>\n&gt; neighbors<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers<br/>\ndesguised<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters<br/>\nwork<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage in<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>\n&gt; Educational<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in<br/>\nlast<br/>\n&gt; &gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of<br/>\nlearning,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; charter.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I<br/>\n&gt; perfer<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves<br/>\nanythign<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all.

I gave them the phone number of the Educational<br/>\nSpecialist<br/>\n&gt; and it was dropped at that. We signed up in the middle of last &quot;school<br/>\nyear&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; By the end of the school year I again had CPS at my door, the same<br/>\nneighbors<br/>\n&gt; called on me again. This time CPS kept on us for a while and then<br/>\neventually<br/>\n&gt; said they found nothing wrong and left us alone. Just yesterday I had the<br/>\n&gt; police called on me by the same people again, accusing me of child neglect<br/>\n&gt; becaue my children are outside playing instead of &quot;inside the house<br/>\n&gt; learning&quot;. The policeman came out, took down our school information,<br/>\nchecked<br/>\n&gt; to make sure my children were in no danger. He in fact came up as we were<br/>\n&gt; engaged in a game, laughing and having a great time together. Although I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t feel I have to explain myself to anyone about why we do what we do,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s what is working for us. I would much rather signup with the<br/>\n&gt; charterschool for now and have the protection from the trouble my<br/>\nneighbors<br/>\n&gt; are trying to cause then to loose my children to the kidnappers desguised<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; a governmetn agency.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for unschooling in the charter, as Sandra Dodd said, some charters work<br/>\n&gt; hard to allow unschooling. The way it works is as we go about our<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; lives I write down the &quot;educational activities&quot; my children do engage in<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; these are categorized by subjects. Once a month I meet with our<br/>\nEducational<br/>\n&gt; Specialist and I give her the information. Twice a year I turn over a<br/>\n&gt; portfolio of samples of my childrens work. The portfolio we turned in last<br/>\n&gt; year was pretty much photographs and tape recordings of my children. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; in any way encourage my children to pursue any specific areas of learning,<br/>\n&gt; but I do notate what they do pursue and give that information over to the<br/>\n&gt; charter.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If anyone wants to consider us not unschooling, then that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever<br/>\n&gt; said I&#39;m a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler and really don&#39;t want any such title. I<br/>\nperfer<br/>\n&gt; to call ourselves natural learners, if we have to call ourselves anythign<br/>\nat<br/>\n&gt; all. We do what works for us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kimberly U<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
