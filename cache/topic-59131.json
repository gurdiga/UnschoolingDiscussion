(They didn&#39;t ask often because they were used to<br/>\nwatching their favorite shows and turning it off.)  While occasionally they<br/>\nwill spend the better part of  the day watching TV, most of the time they<br/>\nwatch little and often none. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was from today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSame at our house, but we were dealing with toddlers.  It was healing for me, <br/>\nafter a regulated childhood with punishments and spankings and such, to say <br/>\nyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby would ask to do something my first response deep inside was to <br/>\nfigure out how to say no, just to keep my own butt at rest.  I hated that <br/>\nfirst response!!  It was a reflection of every lazy-ass cigarette smoking and <br/>\nbeer drinking west Texas mom I had ever seen or been related to when I was <br/>\nKirby&#39;s age.   There was truly a lot of memory-flash of being little when I <br/>\nhad little kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are good and bad points of having vivid emotional memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would say &quot;NO&quot; to that lazy internal mom-dialog, and yes to Kirby.<br/>\nUnless there was a real safety consideration or something was impossible, I <br/>\nwould say yes.  And even sometimes the safety consideration is just that the <br/>\nkid can&#39;t do the desired thing alone, but needs an adult to hold them, or <br/>\nhold the scissors, or plug something in, or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI made it my priority to provide him with a rich and happy life.  That turned <br/>\ninto unschooling easily.  And it made MY life richer and happier than it <br/>\nwould have been if I&#39;d just sat at a table doing whatever I wanted to do, <br/>\ntelling my kids no, shut up, get out of here, I said no, because I said so.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even in parents who have never been that way, and never experienced that <br/>\n(you&#39;re lucky if you&#39;re not quite believing me that there are moms like <br/>\nthat), another version of all that is saying &quot;eat this now, right here, all <br/>\nof it; now watch your one half hour of TV; now read the book I chose for you; <br/>\nnow go to sleep.&quot;  It&#39;s sweeter and more socially acceptable, but it&#39;s still <br/>\na lot of &quot;no&quot; to them doing something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids probably get more thrill from a mom saying &quot;yes&quot; 100 times and them <br/>\ngradually figuring out that it&#39;s probably going to be yes the next time than <br/>\nthey would get from one big &quot;Yes&quot; all of a sudden.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59072,"nextTopicId":59199}}
