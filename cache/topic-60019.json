The house was much cleaner but I was also *so* much<br/>\nmore conscious of it. I mean, all day long, reading message after<br/>\nmessage about clutter and how bad it is.  It made me feel like all of<br/>\nour stuff was clutter.  I was busy &quot;fling boogie&quot;ing things left and<br/>\nright because, you know, &quot;you can&#39;t organize clutter&quot;.  Rather than make<br/>\nme more relaxed, it made me more anxious.  After all, if 150,000 other<br/>\nwomen now have spotless homes thanks to the system, why is mine<br/>\nuncontrollable?  It made me think of my children&#39;s belongings as<br/>\nclutter.  After a series of flylady messages about throwing away kid&#39;s<br/>\nstuff because they don&#39;t need that much anyway and etc, I pulled out a<br/>\ntrash bag and decided to get rid of some stuff.  My son was absolutely<br/>\nhorrified, and I came to my senses and realized it&#39;s not my decision to<br/>\nmake.

Well, if you couldn&#39;t bitch about problems<br/>\nwith her system that meant her system went unchallenged. Either it works or<br/>\nyou didn&#39;t work, one or the other.  Second, it was all up to whoever was<br/>\nreading the emails; mostly women. The system was suppose to make the family<br/>\nmembers help. HA! I went on this kick for awhile, cleaning so that when I<br/>\ndid the living room I was washing the floors with wood soap (Wood floors)<br/>\neach week....by hand, it was so clean, and no one really helped all that<br/>\noften.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHalf my problem is not my stuff but others.  She leaves you two choices;<br/>\nleave it or toss it, if it is the kids. Well, I&#39;m not tossing the children&#39;s<br/>\nstuff, or dh&#39;s and my own stuff, basically if I keep it I want it.  The<br/>\nboogies (27 boogie) meant I was either tossing things I may have wanted or I<br/>\nwas tossing bit of paper etc. But the house is not going to look clean if my<br/>\ndh doesn&#39;t do the recycle, doesn&#39;t want me to do it (he has a particular<br/>\nway) and the recycle keeps flowing out of it&#39;s area and into the rest of the<br/>\nhouse.  The house isn&#39;t going to stay clean if five minutes after I&#39;ve put<br/>\neverything away, the kids take out their toys and spread them on the ground.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAfter awhile all my attention was focused on trying to keep the house clean<br/>\nand i was becoming bitter and angry.  I ended up working all the time to<br/>\nkeep it clean, feeling like a dishrag, and hating the house, the family etc.<br/>\netc. And then I would get sick, or have some other obligation that kept me<br/>\nfrom doing my routines; the house would just collapse and become a mess, and<br/>\nno one was pitching in.  It just didn&#39;t work for us.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMaybe we have too many people with too much stuff for the size of the house,<br/>\nbut FlyLady just left me angry, not happy, and made me feel like a person<br/>\nwho is always on a diet, where they can think of nothing but food.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nbe well,\r<br/>\nRachel Ann\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, March 05, 2003 07:43:53\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: RE: Re [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMy flylady rant: I was subscribed to flylady from last May until just\r<br/>\nafter Christmas.
