Yesterday","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-381361341\">Good morning, I just wanted to say thank you to everybody for their <br/>\nwords of wisdom. I&#39;m hoping that we may be on our past this hurdle in <br/>\nour family. Yesterday Jason(dh)was able to come home early and he <br/>\ntook Avery out so that I could spend some time with Jaiden. I asked <br/>\nhim to come sit with me on the couch and started talking to him about <br/>\nwhen he was a baby and telling him all about the years before Avery <br/>\ncame then I started making up a story about what it would be like now <br/>\nif we didn&#39;t have Avery. He stoped me and told me that I forgot about <br/>\nAvery and I asked him if he wanted me to include Avery and he said <br/>\nyes, because Avery is his favorite brother and he loves him soooooo <br/>\nmuch and he would be sad if we didn&#39;t have Avery anymore. Then I <br/>\nasked him why he likes to hurt Avery so much and he said that he <br/>\ndosen&#39;t like to hurt him he&#39;s just mad at him, because now that we <br/>\nhave Avery he has to wait for everything, he never gets to be first <br/>\nanymore and that makes him mad and sad nad he just ends up hurting <br/>\nAvery because he&#39;s there. So we talked about the things that he <br/>\nmisses by not being the only one.  We also talked about him letting <br/>\nme sleep in the mornings, and he told me that the reason he wakes me <br/>\nup is because he&#39;s hungry, thirsty, and he isn&#39;t allowed to use the <br/>\nvcr by himself. (we don&#39;t have cable and we can&#39;t get reception so <br/>\nit&#39;s movies only at our house). And I remembered that before Avery, <br/>\nJason and I used to set up some snacks, a juice box, a bed on the <br/>\nfloor, and a movie so that he could come out and turn the tv on and <br/>\npress play and he had everything that he needed. We stoped after we <br/>\nhad Avery, got lazy I guess. So I promised jaiden that I would set <br/>\nhim up in the morning again like I used to if he would try to let us <br/>\nsleep a liitl longer in the morning. Jason and I also spent some time <br/>\ntalking last night about how we have been neglecting some of Jaidens <br/>\nneeds because with Avery requiring so much from us, and Jaiden being <br/>\nso self suficiant(sp?) we forget that he&#39;s 4 (just turned) and he&#39;s <br/>\nnot grown up and that it&#39;s not fair of us to expect him to behave as <br/>\none. We both agreed that we have to make sure that he gets more one <br/>\non one with both of us. And that he needs to see us putting him first <br/>\nsometimes.  So this morning I had his bed made up, his snack waiting, <br/>\nand a movie all ready to go and I got to sleep until Avery woke up <br/>\n@1.5 hours later :-)<br/>\nrebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I wanted to put my $0.02 in about spanking. My parents spanked <br/>\nme and my brother, more than that my uncle made them a paddle that <br/>\nhad my name carved into one side and my brother&#39;s name carved into <br/>\nthe other. One side for my spankings, one side for my brothers. They <br/>\nused to say that if we got hit with the wrong side it was because we <br/>\nhad made them so mad that they couldn&#39;t read and so we deserved <br/>\nanother swat with the right side.  So, I have some major problems <br/>\nwith spanking</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45156,"nextTopicId":45556}}
