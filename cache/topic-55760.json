It was very cool. So on sunday I <br/>\ndecided that no matter what my kids ate or drank I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>\nexpect that &quot;hyper behavior&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to put all the negitive <br/>\njunk my parents had put on to to me, back on to them. And damn if <br/>\nthere was no difference in their behavoir, until a friend of ours and <br/>\nhis 3 girls showed up to play, total excitement, we hadn&#39;t seen them <br/>\nsince before x-mas so they were all very excited, so it was not the <br/>\ncandy, it was the situation, major shift in thinking for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to say that both of them have been making amazing food <br/>\nchoices the last few days, I never would have thought that Avery <br/>\nwould not eat the candy in favor of the cheeese, although Jaiden <br/>\nshowed him how to wrap m&ms up in cheese, &lt;shudder&gt; but they both <br/>\nseem to like it, and thats what matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, thank you all so much for your sharing your thoughts and time <br/>\nwith me.
