I read your post--how fascinating <br/>\nto live in Japan!  Well, I have never made soap, but I looked it up on the <br/>\nweb, and came up with some possible help for you.  There is a lye calculator <br/>\non this web site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.the-sage.com/services/calculator.html\">http://www.the-sage.com/services/calculator.html</a>     If you <br/>\nhave trouble getting this info, I would be happy to try and get it and send <br/>\nit to you.  Basically, be ready to submit which kind of lye you will use- <br/>\nsolid or liquid.  The calculator will tell you the amt of lye required to <br/>\nconvert the specified amts of fats and oils to soap.  You will need to know <br/>\nwhat amts of each oil or fat you will use in your recipe.  The list of <br/>\nvarious oils and fats is pretty long to select from on the web page, <br/>\notherwise I would list them here for you.  Well, good luck, and please let me <br/>\nknow if I can help you.     Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7734,"nextTopicId":7798}}
