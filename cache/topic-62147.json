Just looking at it from a different point of view has helped me and Joe tremendously. When a situation comes up now, I stop and remember to take the time to put myself in her place. Feeling things that I wouldn&#39;t normally understand. (see previous post about her wanting me to get into the shower instead of daddy) She&#39;s even letting me hold her more and talking to me more about things. I guess she&#39;s also happy that mommy actually gets it now and isn&#39;t such a moron!!! What a difference this has all made here. No major episodes at all with her. She&#39;s only started to tear up a few times but it never came to actual crying. What a change!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to Sandra who was the only one brave enough to answer my sex and body question!!!!<br/>\nI took Sierra and Joseph to Barnes and Noble on Monday. Joseph just wanted new sneakers and Yu Gi Oh cards so he was a bit taken aback by the unplanned stop. Hey it was right next door. I told him what we were there for. He said he didn&#39;t want a book with naked people in it. The whole time Sierra is saying she does, she does!!! So I asked him if cartoon naked people would be better. He was fine with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey browsed books and I found 2 really good books for both boys and girls. They found some Barbie books with stickers and off we went. They both looked at the books in the car and were laughing at the pictures. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night Sierra came to me and was telling me about how she never knew both girls and boys grew hair down there. She was glad she isn&#39;t older yet!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nJoseph came to me last night and was telling me about a part he read about how when boys go through puberty they sometimes have swollen breasts and think they are getting boobs too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all,  a good choice and the kids seem to think so too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62141,"nextTopicId":62177}}
