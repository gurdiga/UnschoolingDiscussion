But that still only works if the <br/>\nkid(s) haven&#39;t had museums made painful and boring for them by school field trips <br/>\nwith insipid pointless worksheets, being herded away just as they found <br/>\nsomething interesting, and droning guides who always seemed to concentrate on the <br/>\nmost inane details. If mom has also tried in the past to turn museum visits into <br/>\nan &quot;educational experience&quot;, the kid may simply not be able to relax enough to <br/>\ngive it a try, and it isn&#39;t likely at all to sound to him like something more <br/>\ninteresting and cooler than watching tv. Not at first. Not until mom&#39;s built <br/>\nup some credit with him for suggesting cool stuff that actually turned out to <br/>\nBE cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m certainly not putting down museums. Museums in general are some of my <br/>\nfamily&#39;s favorite places on earth. One of my kids&#39; first questions about any <br/>\nplace they learn we&#39;re going to visit is &quot;Are there any cool museums there?&quot; But <br/>\nI&#39;m well aware that for a lot of families the idea that their kids might find a <br/>\nmuseum visit to be &quot;cool&quot; sounds like utter fantasy - I&#39;m saying, okay, save <br/>\nthat till you can all go with fresh eyes. Build up trust with your kids. Maybe <br/>\nmake your first museum visit as an unschooler to someplace none of you have <br/>\never been to before. Watch for visiting exhibits on something your kids are <br/>\nreally interested in, or on something you haven&#39;t ever thought of as <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot;. TV, maybe - :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if your kids haven&#39;t been to school and you haven&#39;t done the &quot;educational <br/>\ntrip&quot; thingie on them - don&#39;t ever start. Go to museums and have fun <br/>\ntogether. Skip the worksheets from the educational department (but check out the loan <br/>\nboxes sometime and maybe poke through the library if you get a chance). Pick <br/>\nthings to look at because they interest you or a kid, not because you think <br/>\nit&#39;s something they ought to know. Move on when someone gets bored. Spend the <br/>\nwhole visit in one spot if that&#39;s what the kid wants to do.   <br/>\n<br/>\n**Family memberships are WONDERFUL because if you want to go and just do one<br/>\nsingle thing, you didn&#39;t &quot;waste money.&quot; We&#39;ve gone to the state science <br/>\nmuseum<br/>\njust to use the microscopes, and we&#39;ve gone to the zoo just to feed the ducks<br/>\nand fish or just to look at the monkeys.**<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, memberships at museums with ASTC membership give you &quot;visiting <br/>\npriveleges&quot; at many other member museums, which makes it easy and painless to decide <br/>\nto drop into a new museum for just a quick visit while travelling. For <br/>\ninstance, this summer we stopped into the Louisville (KY) Science Center for about an <br/>\nhour while we were driving by on our way from Cincinnatti OH to Olney IL, <br/>\nbecause my son had seen a billboard advertising a temporary exhibit that <br/>\ninterested him. It was easy to do without worrying that it might not be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to always keep up a membership with the excellent smaller natural <br/>\nhistory museum two counties west of us (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.burpee.org/)\">http://www.burpee.org/)</a> - we then get <br/>\nregular notices of the goings on there (including a very cool annual dinosaur fest <br/>\nwhere the kids get to meet working paleontologists) and feel the satisfaction <br/>\nof helping a smaller institution, plus we can use the reciprocal membership <br/>\nbenefits at museums in Chicago and Milwaukee (we&#39;re pretty much half way in <br/>\nbetween).<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently Patrick is irritated with me because we haven&#39;t been able to fit a <br/>\nvisit to the Health World museum into our schedule this month, and he&#39;s aching <br/>\nto visit the Grossology exhibit. I messed up. Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":87351,"nextTopicId":87368}}
