Hillary was stillborn <br/>\na few weeks later.  It&#39;s been 11 years and I haven&#39;t been able to stand the <br/>\nsight of fish since.  My kids have been begging me for fish for years and I <br/>\nfinally gave in.  We somehow acquired another cat, two guinea pigs, 3 <br/>\ngoldfish and two snails in a matter of 3 days time.  (My willpower is <br/>\nfailing, huh? lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my luck, one of the dang fish croaked today.  I can&#39;t win!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had other rather fascinating dreams during my pregnancies.  Not many of <br/>\nwhich were bad.  I did dream once that I was in Vegas and gambling while in <br/>\nlabor and seven babies popped out of the machine when I hit the triple 7 <br/>\njackpot.  I was pregnant at the time and we were actually in Vegas on our <br/>\nhoneymoon.  Fortunately, several months later I had only one little girl. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNever did hit that jackpot. :(<br/>\n<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94271,"nextTopicId":94412}}
