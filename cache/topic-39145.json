The point is <br/>\nthat it won&#39;t, first of all, and a second point is that even IF they end up <br/>\nwanting a highly selective university degree then it doesn&#39;t make much sense, <br/>\neconomically, to spend the money getting a BA or BS from a highly selective <br/>\nuniversity -- better to go to a much much less expensive state college (and <br/>\neven start out at community college) and then, IF a highly selective degree <br/>\nis still desired, that might be the time it makes sense to spend the small <br/>\nfortune it costs - in getting a graduate degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is to relieve the fears and trepidations of those considering <br/>\nhomeschooling but who think it might interfere with THEIR college plans for <br/>\ntheir still-young child &lt;G&gt;. But it is good advice, too, for those with older <br/>\nteens who are considering college --- consider NOT spending too much money on <br/>\na BA or BS degree and then going to grad school - an extra year or two for an <br/>\nMA or MS degree - at that expensive place (there are more financial aid <br/>\nopportunities for grad school, too, lots of teaching and research <br/>\nassistanceships that cover all tuition expenses plus a monthly stipend, for <br/>\nexample).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10722572,"authorName":"Nora or Devereaux Cannon","from":"&quot;Nora or Devereaux Cannon&quot; &lt;dcannon@...&gt;","profile":"thatincase","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2153","postDate":"1026319858","msgId":39148,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA0YWIwMWMyMjgzMSRmOGQxYzIwMCQ2NDIyZmVhOUBkYnE1MjBiPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMy4xODAxZTI1OS4yYTVkYmQzOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39147,"nextInTopic":39149,"prevInTime":39147,"nextInTime":39149,"topicId":39145,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"20 years ago our son discovered square and cube exponent/roots playing with pennies on the table - he was 4. ...
