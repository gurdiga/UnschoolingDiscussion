We are<br/>\nin a couple of homeschool groups together.  One is Christain and the other<br/>\nis Inclusive.  The people are just peolple.  We all have our quirks and<br/>\noddities.  Some of the not so &quot;christian&quot; people are nicer as people, but<br/>\nit&#39;s more of a homeschooler thing than anything else, and the church that we<br/>\ngo to and is the sponsor of one of our groups is considdered by some people<br/>\nto be oh so liberal. At least that&#39;s what I heard.<br/>\nAs for me I couldn&#39;t homeschool the way I do; lax, un, relaxed, delight<br/>\ndirected, whatever with out the support of God, my friends, and groups like<br/>\nthis.  No matter who you might think you are a blessing from, you are still<br/>\na blessing to me.<br/>\nCome visit us in Sin City (Las Vegas) some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzan with a Z, wife to beloved husband Steve & happy mommy to my blessings;<br/>\n&quot;sweet girl&quot; Cassia &#39;94, &quot;beany boy&quot; Benjamin &#39;97,  &quot;totkins&quot; Aaron 2K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14351,"nextTopicId":91907}}
