But, those of you <br/>\nwho do not have students of near college age just yet, may want to be on the <br/>\nlook out for this type of mailing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I received an unsolicited snail mail &quot;College Aid Application,&quot; <br/>\nWhile it does NOT look like the FAFSA (which is the FREE application for <br/>\nFEDERAL, and in some cases STATE FINANCIAL AID for College:   &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fafsaonline.com/&quot;\">http://www.fafsaonline.com/&quot;</a>&gt;FAFSA Online <br/>\nApplication Services, FAFSAonline.com, helps you complete the Free Application for <br/>\nFederal Student Financial Aid.&lt;/A&gt;), it does APPEAR to be LEGAL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it basically is, is a form for you to fill out so that they can do <br/>\nSEARCHES for Financial Aid for college for you.  You MUST pay them a &quot;Processing <br/>\nFee&quot; of $39.95.  Optional fees include: an &quot;Updated Service&quot; (to receive a new <br/>\nupdated report in 12 months) for $15.00 (a &quot;savings&quot; of $24.95), &quot;RUSH <br/>\nProcessing&quot; (for priority processing/priority shipping) $10.00.<br/>\n<br/>\nALL OF THESE SERVICES ARE FREE!!!!   If you are willing to do the &quot;leg work&quot; <br/>\nyourself.  It is NOT difficult.  I have found numerous places on the Internet <br/>\nwhere I have found everything from &quot;extra, low interest loans&quot; (for <br/>\nstudents/families not eligible for Federal/State Aid), to various types of &quot;contest <br/>\ngrants.&quot;  These contests (or the ones that I have looked into, are FREE to enter, <br/>\nare NOT scams, and offer a variety of reasons they offer the scholarships <br/>\n(i.e., African American, Gay/Lesbian, dad/mom was in the armed forces, you are a <br/>\nwoman over 35, you are homeschooled, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll try to did up these websites again and send them on to every one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJUST DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SNAIL MAIL SCAM!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nWe forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Arthur Schopenhauer~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76047,"nextTopicId":76059}}
