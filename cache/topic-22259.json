It will become active on June 1,<br/>\n2001.<br/>\n It might be too late by then. It wipes out all files and folders on the<br/>\n<br/>\n harddrive. This virus travels thru E-mail and migrates to the<br/>\n &#39;C:&#92;windows&#92;command&#39; folder.  To find it and get rid of it off of<br/>\n your computer, do the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n Go to the &quot;START&quot; button.<br/>\n Go to &quot;FIND&quot; or &quot;SEARCH&quot;<br/>\n Go to &quot;FILES & FOLDERS&quot;<br/>\n Make sure the find box is searching the &quot;C:&quot; drive.<br/>\n Type in: SULFNBK.EXE<br/>\n Begin search.<br/>\n<br/>\n If it finds it, highlight it.<br/>\n Go to &#39;File&#39; and delete it.<br/>\n Close the find Dialog box<br/>\n Open the Recycle Bin<br/>\n Find the file and delete it from the Recycle bin<br/>\n You should be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n The bad part is: You need to contact everyone you have sent ANY E-mail<br/>\n to in the past few months. Many major companies have found this = virus<br/>\n<br/>\non<br/>\n their  computers. Please help your friends !!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n DO NOT RELY ON YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. McAFEE and NORTON CANNOT<br/>\nDETECT  IT  BECAUSE IT DOES NOT BECOME A VIRUS UNTIL JUNE 1ST.<br/>\n<br/>\n WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT OPEN THE FILE!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22200,"nextTopicId":22277}}
