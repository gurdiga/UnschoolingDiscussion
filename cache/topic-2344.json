I was a youngster when I <br/>\ngraduated from h.s. (16) and I BEGGED my parents to let me stay home for at <br/>\nleast another year and work (I had a good job that I liked) and take a couple <br/>\nof classes at a community college.  Because although I was bright and got <br/>\ngood grades, I had NO idea what I wanted to do with my life.<br/>\nThey absolutely refused.  Instead, they opted to pay for a high-price <br/>\nfreshman year at a private school where I proceeded to pretend like I was <br/>\nolder than I was, collect as many boyfriends as I could, go to as many <br/>\nparties as I could, sleep in as late as I could, etc., etc., etc. <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t consciously trying to punish them, I don&#39;t think.  But, I felt like <br/>\nI was almost giving up...kind of saying:  well, if people won&#39;t take me <br/>\nseriously, I guess I won&#39;t be serious!<br/>\nIt took me a long time to get to the point where I trusted my own desires and <br/>\nneeds...in fact, I struggle with it on a daily basis.<br/>\nThanks for sharing...<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Thomas and Nanci Kuykendall &lt;tn-k4of5@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"n2inLYe_bzIRsxfzDoP6LZaqv2Yz94qSqzENJNpsLsF42wcqUYKB3SDRZZeaJkYLWYHx61NYUNVVA65gAtf_xnNkIU-1SRevNG4FhfVGjBHcaoF9qHIcQ5k","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Giving Kids Choices","postDate":"935779019","msgId":2344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNzMuMjM0NC45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2371,"prevInTime":2343,"nextInTime":2345,"topicId":2344,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... than the end result.

I hated them for it, and they taught me to hate<br/>\nmyself for &quot;never being able to finish anything I start.&quot;  The used to tell<br/>\nme all the time when I was a child that I &quot;Never do anything right&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;Fail at everything I try&quot;  or &quot;Just do not try hard enough.&quot;  I still feel<br/>\nlike a failure and am just now learning to grow and see beyond my parents<br/>\nfalse expectations and pronouncements.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if I might have enjoyed something for myself, I often failed anyway<br/>\ndue to feeling forced, choiceless, coerced, etc.  Like when they forced me<br/>\ninto college at 16 even though I told them I was not ready.  It was either<br/>\nthat, or they were going to kick me out of the house.  So I went.  I did<br/>\nget A&#39;s in several subjects that I really enjoyed, but others I just<br/>\nstopped going to and took a failing grade.  I would have been much more<br/>\nsuccessful had it been my own choice or had I any options.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2367,"nextTopicId":2364}}
