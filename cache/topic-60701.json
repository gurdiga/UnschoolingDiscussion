I agree with a <br/>\nlot of what she said in theory. But don&#39;t agree with a lot of it too. One <br/>\nbig thing CM liked was short lessons. Maybe 15 minutes on a subject and <br/>\nthen move on. This was so that kids didn&#39;t get tired of an activity. But <br/>\nmine barely have time to get into something in 15 minutes. I like letting <br/>\nthem direct the amount of time they spend in things. Even books are read in <br/>\nvery short bites. I think this was so children had time to ruminate on the <br/>\nbooks between sessions. But again, it&#39;s awful to quit just when you really <br/>\nget into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she did respect children as people, not little vessels to be filled <br/>\nwith knowledge. And she did believe they needed a lot of time outdoors to <br/>\nexplore rather than being stuck in a school room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while her list may have been long, &quot;school&quot; time was to be short because <br/>\nshe thought they ought to be outside. But yes, most of this was organized <br/>\nand led by the teacher or mother or caregiver rather than the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like anything else, if you treat it like a cafeteria, taking what you <br/>\nlike and leaving what you don&#39;t, the CM method might have some good things <br/>\nfor you--at least some reassurances for the parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth in IN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 08:59 AM 3/11/2003 -0700, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am learning more and more about the idea of unschooling every day.

There are a lot of<br/>\nreally great ideas, like nature journals and using living books instead<br/>\nof texts.  I also loved the idea of using travel guides for geography.<br/>\nI love to read, so I liked that it was literature-based.  I also loved<br/>\nthe ideas about going outside more and having nature walks.  But when it<br/>\ncomes right down to it, I can&#39;t imagine getting up in the morning,<br/>\nsetting a timer and saying, &quot;Twenty minutes for reading, then we&#39;ll do<br/>\nmath, then a nature walk, etc.&quot;  That just isn&#39;t my style.  And though<br/>\nthe nature journals sound like fun, what if my kids don&#39;t want to do<br/>\nthem?  I bought a great book on nature journaling for myself, because I<br/>\nrealized *I* was the one who liked the idea!  And all the reading -<br/>\nit&#39;ll be great if my sons want to read classic literature.  But if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t, that&#39;s their personality.
