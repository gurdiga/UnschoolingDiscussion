It gets a lot better with age ;&gt;  And it&#39;s not as easy as saying &quot;just get over it&quot;.  There is an &quot;automatic&quot; survival response when you feel like someone is thinking you are not good enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can get better with practice.  If you just recognize the auto-response rising up, you can sometimes stop it, or just remove yourself from the scene until you can get your bearings. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis happened to me recently - my sister was visiting, and she and my mom (a really emotionally unhealthy dynamic duo) were at our house.  My boys started having an altercation over a video game (nothing new there ;&gt;).  I started responding to my beautiful boys the way I thought my very critical mom and sister expected me to, instead of how I would normally help them through these things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt terrible, and I noticed that feeling right away (in the past, this might have taken reflection to see, after some damage to my relationship with my boys had already been done, but now I can see (or feel) it immediately).  So before I got down a road with my boys that was not MY road, I said &quot;excuse me a minute&quot; and I went into the boys room and just lied down on the bed (I was dog tired from all the stress my visiting family gives me, real or imagined ;&gt;, so a rest wasn&#39;t a bad idea anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nMinutes later my boys came in happy and talking with me, altercation completely forgotten, and when we came out I just said to mom and sister &quot;sorry, I guess I just needed to lie down!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to remove myself before I treated my boys in a way I would never treat them if I wasn&#39;t trying to please a very critical audience. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying physically removing yourself is always the best way, but it was the best way for me in this situation, because I didn&#39;t see how to get out of the spiral of judgment and disapproval that was a common theme in my own childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may seem like nothing, or even silly, to those strong or confident enough not to let the judgment of onlookers bother them, but it was a pretty big and positive step for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa (FL)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; hi,<br/>\n&gt; i am very aware of other people and their opinions of me and always want to seem to be doing right in their eyes.  this is not good most of the time. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] handling other people","postDate":"1287242991","msgId":57826,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhCNjY2MzdBLUU4M0YtNDE2Mi1CMEJELUE1Q0VCNzhBMkI1MEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk5YWZzOSs4czdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk5YWZzOSs4czdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57824,"nextInTopic":57829,"prevInTime":57825,"nextInTime":57827,"topicId":57810,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know because I did it, too. I wonder if this is  <br/>\nabout your upbringing? It was my issue for too long that *I* should  <br/>\nlook good in an &quot;authority&#39;s&quot; estimation. British/Canadian military  <br/>\nchildhood, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed more important to me that I was seen to &quot;handle&quot; my daughter  <br/>\nand being doing the &quot;right&quot; thing, in the other person&#39;s eyes.  Not in  <br/>\nmy daughter&#39;s eyes and not in my own either (not how I wanted to  <br/>\nparent). Yikes! Too many years of doing what was expected of me (other  <br/>\nthan the occasional rebellion) came home to roost in my parenting, to  <br/>\nSenna&#39;s detriment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she is a very firm woman and has trained her dog to perfection with  <br/>\n&gt; control techniques(she has no children ....)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And you don&#39;t want to risk her disapproval.

The relationship you want with  <br/>\nyour daughter will always be more important than the one you have with  <br/>\na-moment-in-your-child&#39;s-life-brown owl. It can be hard, when your  <br/>\nconditioning says to get approval from people you consider authority  <br/>\nfigures. But if you don&#39;t, it will whittle away at your child&#39;s trust  <br/>\nin you to be her partner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; another example is abygail is very strong willed and if i say no to  <br/>\n&gt; something then she understandably is annoyed.  i say no rarely but  <br/>\n&gt; she wanted a sleepover after brownies and i said not tonight becos  <br/>\n&gt; it would have meant lots of cycling about in the rain to sort it  <br/>\n&gt; out.  we&#39;d been out all day and i was just too tired.  me and the  <br/>\n&gt; other mum agreed on the next week for the sleep over.  i let her  <br/>\n&gt; rant at me on the way home becos she was upset and tired and  <br/>\n&gt; hungry.  this was fine on the privacy of our walk home but she does  <br/>\n&gt; sometimes verbalise loudly in front of others who i interpret as  <br/>\n&gt; looking at me as if i am at fault and can&#39;t control her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oops, it&#39;s rearing it&#39;s head again, that need for the approval of  <br/>\nothers. Even strangers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; again my impression of what they are thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While it&#39;s important to consider the comfort of others in public  <br/>\nplaces if your daughter&#39;s upset is disturbing people, it&#39;s also your  <br/>\njob to find a safe place for her to &quot;lose it.&quot;  Plan for an escape  <br/>\nroute, be proactive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to look at here: were you prepared to be out all day?  <br/>\nDid you have food, opportunities for downtime and closeness for both  <br/>\nof you? Preparation can deal with the hunger, tiredness and  <br/>\nconsequently, the upset. If we don&#39;t plan well, our kids suffer the  <br/>\nmost for it.  That goes for such things as forgetting/not finding her  <br/>\nsash.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she is 9 and does not do this a lot, but how do i handle my feelings  <br/>\n&gt; in the light of how i think others are perceiving me and my parenting?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sorry to be blunt, but &quot;get over it&quot;. A dear friend finally said that  <br/>\nto me, perhaps with more subtlety, but it made an impression. Be on  <br/>\nyour kid&#39;s side, always. Help her negotiate tricky situations.

I know because for most of my life I have wanted others&#39; approval and have needed to feel like everybody liked me. Only in the last few years, as part of my unschooling journey, have I been able to develop the inner confidence and deep understanding that parenting in this peaceful, loving, respectful way is right, for me and for my children. Consequently others&#39; judgements hold less and less sway over me. It is sometimes not easy to be the odd one out, to take a very different path to what most parents would do, but I am finding more and more that in any given circumstance I am primarily concerned with my kids and their well-being, rather than with what others may think. I don&#39;t mean by this that I have no consideration for other people, rather that someone&#39;s judgement that I&#39;m being &#39;too lenient&#39; for example, is just not meaningful in the context of my relationship with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;i am more concerned that brown owl sees me as the parent i think she thinks i should be......and this is wrong on my part. she is a very firm woman and has trained her dog to perfection with control <br/>\n </span></blockquote>techniques(she has no children ....) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this woman has no kids and has used strict techniques to train her dog. Why are her opinions on parenting, or rather your perception of her opinions on parenting, valuable in your eyes? I mean that seriously, not sarcastically. Is it because she projects an aura of control, of being in charge, of knowing what she is doing? One of the key concepts of unschooling is letting go of the idea of controlling our kids. Partnering, being a team - these ideas are much more useful in building loving, trusting relationships. It has been discussed before on this list that often those who exert a great deal of external control have very little inner security. Far better to turn away from the idea of trying to control others and instead work on building one&#39;s own inner confidence. And when that happens, when a parent has deeply grasped these unschooling ideas and puts them into practice every day, she does project an aura of confidence and knowing what she is doing. This aura of confidence is not smugness, but rather a deep sense of &#39;I am fit to be my child&#39;s parent&#39;, &#39;I am working hard to keep our relationship strong&#39;, &#39;I am at peace with myself and am guided by my love for my child&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\nMelbourne, Australia<br/>\nKids - Ashlin, 5 & Eden, 3</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] handling other people","postDate":"1287224922","msgId":57823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczMjAzNy40MTcxMS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGk5YWZzOSs4czdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk5YWZzOSs4czdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57812,"nextInTopic":57824,"prevInTime":57822,"nextInTime":57824,"topicId":57810,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"but how do i handle my feelings in the light of how i think others are perceiving me and my parenting?

It was matted and wild and like felt in some sections. <br/>\nAnd I had a really hard time with the knowledge that others would judge me as <br/>\nlacking as a parent. It took me a lot of internal debates to get to a point <br/>\nwhere I was comfortable with the fact that it was their hair, their bodies, <br/>\ntheir selves and that they weren&#39;t reflections of me. It helped a lot that they <br/>\nwere willing to be brushed for things where I really felt their appearance was <br/>\nimportant, like going through customs when travelling or going to the doctor&#39;s <br/>\nor the dentist&#39;s who can report children they feel are not being cared for to <br/>\nsocial services. It helped a lot for me to be obviously attentive and loving and <br/>\nengaged with them when we were out. And it took real knowledge that people <br/>\nactually don&#39;t really care all that much about what some strangers are doing. Or <br/>\neven what some acquaintances are doing and if we were friends, well they weren&#39;t <br/>\nthat fussed to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter wasn&#39;t bothered by the admonition of her Brownie leader it <br/>\nisn&#39;t really that valuable for you to be. It is a waste of energy and concern <br/>\nand worry on your part. Next time make sure you have all of the pieces of her <br/>\nkit together for Brownie lessons well in advance of going. It&#39;s easy to feel <br/>\nlike you let your daughter and her Brownie leader down, you did. Use that <br/>\nfeeling to make sure that you&#39;ve got everything together for next time, or to <br/>\nhelp your daughter to get everything in one place so that it&#39;s easy and quick to <br/>\ngather up to take along. Have lists on the fridge or the door or a whiteboard in <br/>\nthe hall of everything you need to have together for whatever things you and <br/>\nyour children are committed to doing. Add to it when something is added and <br/>\nsubtract from it when something is taken away. It really helps if you are <br/>\ndisorganized generally to have in place things that will cover for your lack of <br/>\nstructure. Take more time to make sure that you and your daughter are fed before <br/>\ngoing out, bring snacks and drinks for the walk home. If you&#39;ve had a really <br/>\nbusy day, up your energy before you go do something else. Add that to your <br/>\nlists. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes no&#39;s are hard to take. That&#39;s fair enough. I get grouchy sometimes <br/>\nwhen I get a no even if it is absolutely understandable. And if you were tired <br/>\nmy guess is that your daughter was also tired. Be forgiving and generous and <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel like all that you&#39;ve done so far should mean that she&#39;s always happy <br/>\nwith you, always understanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: m_aduhene &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:m_aduhene@...\">m_aduhene@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 15 October, 2010 22:08:25<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] handling other people<br/>\n<br/>\nhi,<br/>\ni am very aware of other people and their opinions of me and always want to seem <br/>\nto be doing right in their eyes.  this is not good most of the time.<br/>\nfor example, tonight at my daughter&#39;s brownie&#39;s group i could not find her sash <br/>\nwhich holds her badges and her promise badge.  my daughter was upset(not crying <br/>\njust making known she wasn&#39;t happy, not in a shouting way, just as in &quot;it&#39;s not <br/>\nfair i won&#39;t get my smart brownie badge....brown owl please can i still have the <br/>\nbadge.&quot;  i said i was sorry to brown owl and to abygail that i couldn&#39;t find it <br/>\nand that it was my fault.  brown owl then put her finger to her lips and said to <br/>\nmy daughter &quot;now don&#39;t sulk, put that bottom lip away (almost &quot;come on stop it <br/>\nnow&quot; in that tone, not jokingly).  unfortunately becos i then get embarrassed <br/>\nand think oh no abygail is being unreasonable (which she wasn&#39;t, just upset) i <br/>\nthen get a bit annoyed with her and use the wrong tones etc.  i am more <br/>\nconcerned that brown owl sees me as the parent i think she thinks i should <br/>\nbe......and this is wrong on my part.<br/>\nshe is a very firm woman and has trained her dog to perfection with control <br/>\ntechniques(she has no children ....)  she is lovely and i don&#39;t like to offend <br/>\nbut i felt she was wrong in this situation to speak to abygail like that when i <br/>\nwas present.  i know we always meet people who parent differently but how do i <br/>\nstick up for my views and not let my negative side come out?<br/>\nanother example is abygail is very strong willed and if i say no to something <br/>\nthen she understandably is annoyed.  i say no rarely but she wanted a sleepover <br/>\nafter brownies and i said not tonight becos it would have meant lots of cycling <br/>\nabout in the rain to sort it out.  we&#39;d been out all day and i was just too <br/>\ntired.  me and the other mum agreed on the next week for the sleep over.  i let <br/>\nher rant at me on the way home becos she was upset and tired and hungry.  this <br/>\nwas fine on the privacy of our walk home but she does sometimes verbalise loudly <br/>\nin front of others who i interpret as looking at me as if i am at fault and <br/>\ncan&#39;t control her.  again my impression of what they are thinking.<br/>\nshe is 9 and does not do this a lot, but how do i handle my feelings in the <br/>\nlight of how i think others are perceiving me and my parenting?<br/>\nsorry long winded<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
