If the buyer doesn&#39;t like the book, we refund<br/>\nwith no questions asked (we get less than one return per 800 or more sold).<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding books is not a problem: thrift stores, flea markets, garage sales,<br/>\nused book stores, library book sales, rummage sales, church bazaars,<br/>\nadvertisements that you buy books in the local papers, etc., all will get<br/>\nyou more books than you know what to do with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a website, though it&#39;s just a gateway right now to our inventory on<br/>\nother sites. My husband is the web page designer and it&#39;s &quot;in progress&quot;. We<br/>\ndon&#39;t sell books on a walk-in basis, only by mail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what books are worth by research -- other booksellers asking prices,<br/>\nrecent auction results, a multitude of books on the trade, gut feeling, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy. I have had dozens of people ask me &quot;how do I get started?&quot;<br/>\nand I tell them and they try and give up in very short order. You have to be<br/>\nprepared to put in the time to learn, and then put in the sweat (books are<br/>\nheavy!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned what to buy by trial and a lot of error. My instincts and memory<br/>\nare both good, and keep us fed. Dog training was easier, but I like being<br/>\nable to work midnight to 2 a.m. (my peak hours &lt;g&gt;) and dealing with the<br/>\ndifficult people by e-mail is easier than dealing with difficult people in<br/>\nperson or even on the phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started by reading and cataloging and graphing (did anyone doubt it? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\nclosed eBay auctions in my specialty categories of choice. That sort of<br/>\nactivity helps me memorize, and I put in more than 200 hours just reading<br/>\nand graphing and indexing on line before I bought a single book for resale.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend one or two days a week buying, and the rest of the week on data<br/>\nentry, shipping, cleaning, shelving, sorting, stacking, researching and<br/>\nlugging.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children, when spying a new book, pick it up with great tenderness and<br/>\nask, &quot;Is this to sell, or do we get to keep it?&quot; The bonus for them is, they<br/>\nown a lot of books since I&#39;m always buying for them, and my husband, and<br/>\nmyself, and our friends and family, as well as for the customers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26877,"nextTopicId":26883}}
