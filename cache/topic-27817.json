It only became a &quot;fad&quot; after<br/>\ntelevision/movies made it &quot;kewl.&quot;  That does NOT say that karate IS a fad,<br/>\nonly that it &quot;viewed&quot; as a fad by certain elements in society.  Nor does it<br/>\nsay that &quot;little Kirby&quot; took up karate because it was a fad.  However, since<br/>\nwe do not live in a culture where karate is part of life, then exposure to<br/>\nit usually comes from the fact that it has become a &quot;fad&quot; or &quot;in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThings can be fads without people doing them because they are fads.<br/>\n<br/>\nSUVs are fads, they are &quot;in,&quot; they are &quot;kewl.&quot;  I own an SUV but not because<br/>\nof those reasons.

He started at nine (somewhat late for that school) and<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; still there at 15.  The two teens who outranked him have left for<br/>\n&gt; extracurricular school stuff now, and he&#39;s the ranking kid.  The school<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t allow black belts before the age of 18, but he cares nothing for<br/>\n&gt; that, because a large part of their training is personal best and team<br/>\n&gt; effort, respect for the tradition, and not advancement or glory.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For those who know about such things, it&#39;s Shorin-Ryu, and Ed Erler is the<br/>\n&gt; Sensei.  Kirby has participated in some of the regional seminars they<br/>\nsponsor<br/>\n&gt; with visiting teachers.  In those he&#39;s usually been the youngest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He went because he wants to.  He stays because he wants to.
