I have had some interesting experiences with this. I used to<br/>\ntake my kids&#39; candy after Halloween and Easter and then dole it out to them<br/>\na piece at a time because I thought they would eat it all at once and get<br/>\nsick. Then one year I was busy and forgot to take their Halloween candy.<br/>\nThey each had enough candy to fill a pillowcase. Two of my ds&#39;s had eaten<br/>\nall their candy within a couple of days. My dd was able to get hers to last<br/>\nfor about 2 weeks. My oldest ds made his last until the next Halloween, no<br/>\nkidding! After that, I quit regulating their candy stashes. My youngest ds<br/>\nstill has most of his Easter candy from this year, and they didn&#39;t get very<br/>\nmuch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, when we had made some homemade oatmeal cookies, my middle ds<br/>\nate so many cookies that he &quot;tossed his cookies!&quot; We had warned him that<br/>\nwould happen, but he did not heed the warning. He doesn&#39;t like oatmeal<br/>\ncookies anymore. But now when we warn any of the kids that they might be<br/>\nover doing it, all we have to do is remind them of the cookie incident and<br/>\nthey at least slow down their consumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother experience with my middle ds, when he was quite young, maybe 3 or 4,<br/>\nwe had to take him to the ER for bad asthma attack. Everyone else in the ER<br/>\nwas there for stomach bug. ds was admitted to the hospital for a few days. A<br/>\nfew days after he got back home, surprise! he had the stomach bug. He lost<br/>\n10 lbs! Dr told us to let him eat whatever he wanted, as much as he wanted,<br/>\nwhenever he wanted after he got well so that he could gain back the weight.<br/>\nJust about all he wanted was cold cereal, so we let him eat it for<br/>\neverymeal. Interestingly enough, at 13 1/2 yo, cold cereal is still his<br/>\nfavorite food. He likes very little else and would still like to eat it for<br/>\nevery meal. But it is too expensive to let him do so, plus when ever he has<br/>\ncereal for a meal other than breakfast, his younger brother wants some too.<br/>\nIce cream is his second favorite food. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36151,"nextTopicId":35852}}
