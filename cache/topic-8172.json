Looking back, <br/>\nis there anything that ,in your opinion, would have helped you with your <br/>\nshyness?  Do you think your parents could have or should have handled things <br/>\ndifferently, so that you would maybe have been more comfortable in new <br/>\nsituations?  I remembered being extremely shy as a child, and I definitely <br/>\ndid not want to be pushed into anything, and I don&#39;t want to push my child <br/>\ntoo much, either; however, sometimes he needs that encouragement... to find <br/>\nout that things can be fun to do.  Yesterday we went to an Easter egg hunt.  <br/>\nBefore we left to go, my little boy expressed how he was scared.  I told him <br/>\nthat we were going to go ahead and go, and that he could see what it was like <br/>\nwhen we got there, and that if he decided that he did not want to do it, that <br/>\nhe did not have to. Well, he ended up taking part,and enjoying it, so I was <br/>\nhappy for him, but the shyness is something we have to deal with continually. <br/>\nSo, if you, or anyone else, would have any thoughts on dealing with shyness, <br/>\nI&#39;d like to hear them.  Thanks in advance!                                      <br/>\n                                Karen--in Ind</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Hafidha","from":"&quot;Hafidha&quot;&lt;hafidha@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"zL-Uc96MVl2Ki70JTTpHbUHKzXaAcJKm5oe5TAwD5GOQXnZIeC7ZdpdJAJSi37yjzZIZ6pZv870gwY0rJx-HTso","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] from unschool grad","postDate":"955899992","msgId":8172,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4ZjllMDU4LjRjZTIuMEBqcHMubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8182,"prevInTime":8171,"nextInTime":8173,"topicId":8172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, ... the piano when I was younger.
