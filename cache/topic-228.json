I don&#39;t see how she can do that, when she homeschooled<br/>\nmy little sister who just graduated at the WHO ceremony on May 23rd. She keeps<br/>\nasking how Tara (5 yo) is going to get social interaction and saying that she<br/>\nneeds to be in public school. I hope you all don&#39;t mind, I forwarded some of<br/>\nyour horrifying stories about ps to her in hopes that she would get the hint<br/>\n(still no responce from her though). Does anybody have any suggestions to get<br/>\nher off my back?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: =?ISO-2022-JP?B?GyRCMjxAbiEhTUA7VkknGyhC?=  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RXP10715@...\">RXP10715@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I sure do wish I could shout it to the world - &quot;Everybody!  Unschool <br/>\n&gt;your kids!!!&quot;  But I guess like politics, homeschooling is kind of like <br/>\n&gt;a religion of its own.  There are those who agree, and those who don&#39;t, <br/>\n&gt;and no one likes people pushing religion (whether spiritual in nature or <br/>\n&gt;not).  There&#39;s an American lady nearby, and she hates being a mother.  <br/>\n&gt;She can hardly wait for her son to be in school, and thinks that the <br/>\n&gt;long school hours plus cram school plus endless hours of homework per <br/>\n&gt;night is wonderful to keep her son occupied.  I wish I could tell her <br/>\n&gt;about unschooling in a way that wouldn&#39;t be offensive to her.  I kind of <br/>\n&gt;mentioned it once, but she got so defensive (even though all I said was <br/>\n&gt;that I plan to homeschool my son, and what does she plan to do about her <br/>\n&gt;son&#39;s education) that I just dropped it.  And converting my mother and <br/>\n&gt;mother-in-law (MIL) seems impossible.  I hinted to my sister that my mom <br/>\n&gt;was thinking about possibly homeschooling her maybe, and my mom got so <br/>\n&gt;offended - now I&#39;m afraid to open her e-mails &#39;cuz most likely she&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt;flame me.  Maybe I&#39;m just the offensive type.  Does anyone else feel <br/>\n&gt;this way?  How do you get your family or neighbors or whatever to accept <br/>\n&gt;you for who you are, and not reject you because of a difference of <br/>\n&gt;beliefs?  (Even though we unschoolers are right... hehe :-))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Love, Melanie in Japan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;With more than 18 million e-mails exchanged daily...<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com\">http://www.onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;....ONElist is THE place where the world talks!<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>---SENT FROM A FREE INTERNET AND EMAIL ACCOUNT FROM WWW.FREEi.NET!---</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":346,"nextTopicId":86}}
