My<br/>\nhusband just <br/>\nput new laminate floors down a few months ago and the cat has ruined an<br/>\nentire <br/>\ncorner and the flooring is discontinued.<br/>\nThe smell is annoying and a topic weekly on trash day.

Several people have made<br/>\nsuggestions. The other is should your son be responsible for the cat,<br/>\nespecially one that is not fully well. The third issue is that you and<br/>\nyour husband have something interfering with your happy relationship on<br/>\nan ongoing basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was that maybe you should just step away from the<br/>\nsituation. Invite your husband to take the matter up with your son<br/>\ndirectly, and take up the catshit too. This is of course easier said<br/>\nthan done. My dh was always complaining about mess that Jayn makes, and<br/>\nwould walk over the doll on the floor ten times, and grumble, rather<br/>\nthan just pick the thing up. If I ask him to help me, he is always<br/>\nwilling to. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son can&#39;t take care of the cat, it should not be &quot;his&quot; cat. This<br/>\nis a living creature, and I don&#39;t think falls into the same category as<br/>\na simply messy room (see archives for lengthy discussions on that topic)<br/>\nthat can be left alone with the door shut. If it is approached as giving<br/>\nhim a break from the cat, or helping him out with it, maybe he won&#39;t<br/>\nfeel punished. Having the cat removed from his space and care sounds<br/>\nlike a natural consequence to me, rather than an arbitrary one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my room mate had a cat that started going all over the place, it<br/>\nturned out to have a bladder infection caused by too much dried food in<br/>\nthe diet. I also remember some room mates years ago that had kittens<br/>\nthat basically destroyed the carpets of our rental. I think they<br/>\neventually all moved out, but not before I had made some pretty angry<br/>\ndemands, and cleaned up a lot. The cats were pooping at the doormat of<br/>\nthe back door frequently - I think they wanted out. <br/>\n<br/>\nA final thought - what about one of those electronic litter boxes that<br/>\nrakes the clumps away?

The cat box has to be kept immaculately clean. Some cats<br/>\nare way more serious about this than others. The automatic cleaning boxes<br/>\nare great. Try all different kinds of cat litter and also cat boxes. Some<br/>\ncats like larger boxes, and some like to be concealed as in a box with a<br/>\nhood.

The cat has a skin condition and no claws so I <br/>\ncant find a home right now or offer the kitty to potty outside.

They ask<br/>\nus, or start playing all about the subject of interest, or draw pictures of<br/>\nthat, or ask for books about it, etc. And what they don&#39;t show interest in,<br/>\nwe don&#39;t push. (Not sure that&#39;s a good word as we don&#39;t push even the<br/>\ninterested subjects.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if one is just showing interest, we don&#39;t go out all gangbusters. When<br/>\nmy kids show an interest in something, I don&#39;t go and spend tons of money on<br/>\nit in case that interest is short lived. We start small and go as they want.<br/>\nThat way if the interest is satisfied, I don&#39;t feel like we&#39;ve signed up and<br/>\nspent great amounts of time with something that has passed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with tv and such. We have a love or horror movies here. Joe and Tara<br/>\nand I love them. I didn&#39;t sit my other children down and show them Friday<br/>\nthe 13th. We started with the old black and white Them. A really corney<br/>\nmovie about giant ants but the kids loved it. Joseph has a love for the<br/>\n*can&#39;t possibly be real* type scary movies. Like Starship Troopers and<br/>\nTremors. But awhile ago there was something we watched that made him tell us<br/>\nit scared him and he didn&#39;t like it. I can&#39;t even remember what it was.<br/>\nSierra was fine with it and he wasn&#39;t. He wasn&#39;t traumatized by it, but<br/>\naware that he didn&#39;t like it. So again, it was one step at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how we are able to gauge levels for each kid at different ages.
