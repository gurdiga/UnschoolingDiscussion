We didn&#39;t use it all the <br/>\ntime, just those occasions that we needed a quick bottle and didn&#39;t have time to <br/>\ndo the whole sanitization process. People used to laugh when they came to our <br/>\nhouse and went to the fridge for something to drink. Kind of like a frat <br/>\nhouse, but instead of beer, it was shelves and shelves of baby bottles. <br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: breastfeeding - why I didn&#39;t","postDate":"1063774745","msgId":80726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjNC5mMDMzYjliLjJjOTk0NDE5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":80706,"nextInTopic":80732,"prevInTime":80725,"nextInTime":80727,"topicId":80706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/16/03 10:28:27 PM Central Daylight Time, RJHill241@aol.com writes: When I got pregnant with Kass and Kree I began lactating about 4 weeks","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2023117959\">In a message dated 9/16/03 10:28:27 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:RJHill241@...\">RJHill241@...</a> writes:<br/>\nWhen I got pregnant with Kass and Kree I began lactating about 4 weeks into <br/>\nmy pregnancy.

I had never known anyone else that had that happen. We were <br/>\nwaking up in large puddles all night. It was awful. The further I got, the worse it <br/>\ngot.

I cried in pain when I took a shower, from the beginning <br/>\nto the end and for months after their birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew the entire time I would not be breastfeeding as just the thought <br/>\nhorrified me, because the pain was so excrutiating during my pregnancy, I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nfathom letting them latch on. Then when they got here, I cried at not even <br/>\nfeeling the need to try, if that makes sense. When the nurse came in to ask if I <br/>\nwould like to give it a shot, I asked her if she was high! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I won&#39;t go into all the things they experimented with trying to get <br/>\nmy milk to stop, I will say even the doctors didn&#39;t know what else to try to <br/>\nmake me stop or &quot;dry up&quot;. So for the first few months of their lives I could <br/>\nhardly be touched anywhere near my chest. But I guess since the pain was so bad, <br/>\nI didn&#39;t feel like I had lost out in any way, because here I had 2 perfect <br/>\nbabies, gone full term and they were so healthy they tried to send the babies <br/>\nhome without me! Here they were, six and a half pounds each. I had gained 64 <br/>\npounds total and the day after they were born I&#39;d lost 58. I was very sick, and <br/>\nwas not discharged. I left when they discharged the twins and told me I had to <br/>\nstay. I just couldn&#39;t believe that after all I had gone through to get them to <br/>\nEarth, they wanted to ship them home with Phil and keep me. So I left and <br/>\nPhil and my mom took care of me and the twins. They had to call my OB every 2 <br/>\nhours since I left while being under doctors orders to stay. No one was too happy <br/>\nwith me, but my babies and I knew I wasn&#39;t leaving them for a minute!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy pregnancy was full of trauma and the leaking was just a part of it. <br/>\nEverything worked out and it was definately predestined that I got two in one shot, <br/>\ncuz I&#39;d never do it again. I kept waiting to get that &quot;glow&quot; everyone talks <br/>\nabout, huh, never happened here! I guess maybe that was more than you asked for, <br/>\nbut I tend to ramble, if you haven&#39;t guessed ;-). I&#39;ll stop before I go too <br/>\nfar, hehehehehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80695,"nextTopicId":80701}}
