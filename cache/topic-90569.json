Look into<br/>\nthe Houston Unschoolers Group (HUG).  Last I heard Holly Fergason (who I<br/>\nhave seen recently here or at Alwayslearning) was the leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nHouston has some wonderful advantages.  The zoo is good and cheap.  The<br/>\nchildren&#39;s museum is a lot of fun.  Galveston is a blast for the beach.  The<br/>\nship channel is cool if you like to watch big boats.  College football is a<br/>\nlot of fun there between Uof Houston and Rice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived in Katy, just west of Houston both times.  Housing ranges from the<br/>\n70&#39;s to 500,000. Most neighborhoods and lots of individual homes have pools.<br/>\nLow crime, good restaurants.  If you check out that area, try El Jarito<br/>\nrestaurant on Mason for some great Mexican food.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail me privately if you wish.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Laura&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TomandLaura95@...\">TomandLaura95@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, February 08, 2004 9:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Moving to Houston<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t post much, and sometimes don&#39;t get to read all the posts--but<br/>\n&gt; I love being a part of this list.
