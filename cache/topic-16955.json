That is sooo terrific that your daughters <br/>\nhave adjusted so quickly and that you are comfortable with <br/>\nunschooling them!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 4th child is scheduled for c-section on Friday morning and I <br/>\ncould relate to your description of your recent pregnancy.  <br/>\nUnschooling just seems to fit into all of the rhythyms of life and <br/>\neven allows Mom to be sick or busy with the baby or a million other <br/>\nthings, while the other children are free to do the things that <br/>\ninterest them.  They also really seem to learn how to help each other <br/>\nand take care of the people around them.  I couldn&#39;t even imagine <br/>\nhaving this baby and being on my children&#39;s school timetable!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and I&#39;d love to hear more about how your days are going!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  One of the things my children like is doing mad-libs on the <br/>\ninternet or the ones from Scholastic.  They are fun for all of us!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49210,"nextTopicId":49205}}
