When I came to pick Ross up, he<br/>\nexcitedly showed them to me, and the director quickly added, with a nervous<br/>\nlook, &quot;As long as your mother says it&#39;s okay.&quot;  I replied that, sure, it was<br/>\nfine with me.  I have since found, when mentioning my son&#39;s new pets to<br/>\nfriends and family, that most mothers don&#39;t have that level of cockroach<br/>\nacceptance (actually, I think the hissing cockroaches are kind of cute<br/>\n&lt;grin&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy difficulties are with the many-legged creatures.  I&#39;m gradually getting<br/>\nused to millipedes (the wave action of their legs bothered me for some<br/>\nreason) (btw, we recently learned at the museum that the most legs they&#39;ve<br/>\ncounted on a millipede is around 780).  Centipedes - particularly the black<br/>\nones with the neon yellow legs, still bother me, however (or is it the neon<br/>\nyellow ones with the black legs?  I look away too quickly to remember &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94778,"nextTopicId":94804}}
