Evidently, she can&#39;t keep track of <br/>\nthem... She may even still be having puppies.  We had the one, trying to take <br/>\ncare of it.. Then, another one appeared outside a few feet from the workshop. <br/>\n We just put it on the blade of a shovel and put it back beside her.. She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t reject it.   So, we brought #1 wayward puppy back and put him with her <br/>\ntoo.  I do think, when she comes out, we will just have to get her and bring <br/>\nher in the house and then get the puppies.  Otherwise, she seems to keep <br/>\n&quot;losing&quot; them.  They are incredibly strong and mobile to be only hours old.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67568,"nextTopicId":66854}}
