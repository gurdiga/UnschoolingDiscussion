I did ask my son to write two <br/>\nthank you&#39;s yesterday to two sets of grandparents that always send multiple gifts <br/>\nto the children and live many states away.  He&#39;s 10 and wrote a short note to <br/>\neach talking about a couple of his favorite gifts.  I asked him to change <br/>\n&quot;crismas&quot; to &quot;Christmas&quot; in one letter because the one grandmother is very <br/>\nreligious and was a 1st grade teacher. Sometimes, it&#39;s important to take the time <br/>\nfor little things just because we love and honor someone.  He was fine with it <br/>\nand I addressed the envelopes and put in pictures of him taken on Christmas <br/>\nmorning.   It will mean so much to them all because they very seldom get to see <br/>\nthe children. However, if he had really not wanted to do it, I would not have <br/>\ninsisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did mention some of the ideas about thank you notes from this list and he <br/>\nloved the lego idea.  He then decided it would be fun to do a claymation thank <br/>\nyou and spent part of the evening deciding how he would do that.  My new view <br/>\non thank you notes (besides the two that I helped him send out) is that it is <br/>\noptional. However, I have left the thank you cards out on the table while I <br/>\nworked on them and I noticed that my 14 year old daughter has written some. <br/>\nMaybe, he&#39;ll follow up on his Claymation idea.
