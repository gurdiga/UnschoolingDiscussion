The internet is a wonderful &quot;place&quot; to contact<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;like-minded people, but it is not the same as having a real community.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter is only 2 and we have only begun researching homeschooling,<br/>\nand then ultimately unschooling, in the past 6 months.  But even so, I&#39;ve<br/>\nalready joined the local support group in our area, Tulsa, Oklahoma, for<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  I thought for sure we would be out of place being<br/>\nnon-churchgoers and planning to unschool, but to my surprise, most of<br/>\nthese families who&#39;ve been doing it for years already have moved<br/>\nnaturally from schooling at home to unschooling, and they are eager to<br/>\ntalk about it at these Mom&#39;s Night Out or Monthly meetings.  I highly<br/>\nrecommend it, even if you don&#39;t begin right away.  It&#39;s a great way to<br/>\nput into reality all the things we&#39;ve read and thought that brought us to<br/>\nthis decision.  And, it makes a real life community instead of that vast<br/>\ninternet one.  You can look in the back of GWS or HEM for the support<br/>\ngroup nearest you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!

This is a literature based <br/>\n&quot;curriculum&quot; that&#39;s not very curricular.  What you do is read some really <br/>\ngood picture books several times and explore concepts in language arts, <br/>\nsocial studies, science and art.  I think the best ages for this are 5 and 6, <br/>\nbut your potential kids could be within the range.<br/>\n(Check out the website: www.fiveinarow.com.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey do recommend supplementing Five in a Row with math and phonics <br/>\ninstruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne lesson book, covering about 20 books, or 20 weeks of lessons costs about <br/>\n$20, I think.  You can get the story books at the library, usually.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, something with lots of reading stories on the couch and having the <br/>\nsiblings work on the same stuff, but at their own level seems like it would <br/>\npromote togetherness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have less clear ideas about how to approach an 8 year old.
