I wanted to bring the principle <br/>\nbehind the discussion over to discuss in a broader forum--not an easy <br/>\ntransition. While I would agree with Robyn&#39;s characterization of the <br/>\ndiscussion (and of course the whole thing&#39;s available at AU for anyone&#39;s <br/>\nperusal), for me it went beyond any single recent post about &quot;couch <br/>\ndad.&quot; It is more a conglomeration of posts and situations and <br/>\nrecommendations, compounded by a recent reading of Rosenberg&#39;s <br/>\n_Non-Violent Communication_ as part of an ongoing monthly book <br/>\ndiscussion. For me, it&#39;s a bunch of things swirling together that all <br/>\nseem to converge at the point of *to judge or not to judge--what is the <br/>\nunschooling parent&#39;s role?*<br/>\n<br/>\nRosenberg&#39;s theory in a nutshell contains four ordered components: <br/>\nobservation, feeling, needs, request. First we observe, the &quot;trick is to <br/>\nbe able to articulate this observation without introducing any judgment <br/>\nor evaluation--to simply say what people are doing that we either like <br/>\nor don&#39;t like&quot; (6). Rosenberg differentiates between &quot;moralistic&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;value&quot; judgments. He writes, &quot;All of us make value judgments as to the <br/>\nqualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, <br/>\nfreedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can <br/>\nbest be served. We make *moralistic judgments* of people and behaviors <br/>\nthat fail to support our value judgments, e.g. &#39;Violence is bad. People <br/>\nwho kill others are evil.&#39; Had we been raised speaking a language that <br/>\nfacilitated the expression of compassion, we would have learned to <br/>\narticulate our needs and values directly, rather than to insinuate <br/>\nwrongness when they have not been met. For example instead of &#39;Violence <br/>\nis bad,&#39; we might say instead, &#39;I am fearful of the use of violence to <br/>\nresolve conflicts; I value the resolution of human conflicts through <br/>\nother means.&#39;&quot; (17).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so there&#39;s lots more, but that gets at the whole judgment thing. I <br/>\npersonally find Rosenberg&#39;s language wordy, stilted and formulaic. <br/>\nMoreover, I don&#39;t find moralistic judgments of behaviors to translate to <br/>\nthe person. I don&#39;t make the logical leap that people who choose <br/>\nviolence are evil. I believe it is possible to talk about and evaluate <br/>\nactions and choices within the moment without translating those <br/>\nevaluations to the person over all time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to put it in more practical terms, if one of my children is hitting <br/>\nanother person (friend, sibling, parent, whatever, even the dog) with <br/>\nhis sword, I&#39;m not going to stand there using the four wordy steps only <br/>\nto end in a request that he please stop hitting with the sword. I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to say &quot;Stop! Hitting hurts!&quot; or something brief and to that <br/>\neffect. If I&#39;m close enough, I&#39;m going to grab the sword in mid air <br/>\nbefore it lands another blow. The sword is available only on the <br/>\ncondition that it&#39;s not being used to hurt. As soon as that condition is <br/>\nmet, the sword is immediately available. My child decides that, not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother specific example that I posted today...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, the kids were out in the driveway drawing with chalk with <br/>\nour 8 yo neighbor, who is very sweet and quiet most of the time--tends <br/>\nto become overwhelmed by my children&#39;s exuberance. Sam (5) got very <br/>\nexcited and walked up to the little girl sitting in the driveway and <br/>\nstarted doing his &quot;butt dance,&quot; shaking his hips back and forth Elvis <br/>\nstyle, which he does when he&#39;s very excited. However, this meant that <br/>\nhis groin was right in the little girl&#39;s face shaking back and forth, <br/>\nChippendale style. All I had to say was, &quot;Sam, honey, no thank you.&quot; He <br/>\nwas fine with that; he was just really excited and having fun. He moved <br/>\noff and found something else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, however, we had a conversation about how shaking one&#39;s groin or <br/>\nbutt in someone else&#39;s face or at someone else was *inappropriate.*  I <br/>\njudged and labeled the action inappropriate without implying that Sam is <br/>\ninappropriate. We talked about how doing the butt dance at home with <br/>\nfamily was fine, but there are some things we only do at home with <br/>\nfamily and we don&#39;t do this in anyone&#39;s face. I had no qualms whatsoever <br/>\nin passing judgment on his action or making that sweeping generalization <br/>\nabout the likely interpretation of his action out in the wider world <br/>\n(even though he may someday become a Chippendale dancer and make loads <br/>\nof money doing what I labeled as inappropriate for general social <br/>\ninteraction). It was simple, easy, to the point, useful, practical <br/>\ninformation that he *needs* to have. No shame, no blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I had simply focused on his need--to express his excitement and <br/>\nexuberance--and expressed C&#39;s need--she needs to feel safe in her space, <br/>\nor whatever--that may have helped him in the moment but it would not <br/>\nnecessarily have translated into the next situation. If I had gone <br/>\nthrough all of Rosenberg&#39;s four steps with Sam in the moment, it would <br/>\nhave drawn more attention to the behavior than I deemed necessary and <br/>\nthat attention in and of itself may have been shaming. Sometimes <br/>\nsweeping generalizations are useful and expedient.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Sam had done this over at C&#39;s house where her father, for instance, <br/>\nwere the one to see it, that may have resulted in a very different <br/>\nsituation. He could have been shamed and scolded and made to feel like a <br/>\nterrible person and sent home. That&#39;s not something I want to happen, <br/>\nand if my judgment of his actions, labeling them inappropriate, can <br/>\nprevent that--great! That&#39;s what I mean when I say that I believe not <br/>\nsharing judgment and rationale can have cruel results. Not everything <br/>\nmust be learned through trial and error.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe having more specific and less hypothetical situations will make <br/>\nthis whole discussion more clear, I don&#39;t know.

The paraphrase of it all in general is <br/>\nthat some people seem to use unschooling as an excuse to do LESS with and for <br/>\ntheir children, rather than more.   Some people seem to see unschooling out of <br/>\nthe corner of their eye and glom onto it as a way to justify their inability or <br/>\nunwillingness to really see their kids directly and help them learn to live <br/>\nand act in ways that will benefit them (the children) and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, I think, is a distraction and a disservice to those unschooling who can <br/>\nand want to really create a totally nurturing life in which their children <br/>\ncan thrive.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have one quote: <br/>\n&quot;While I totally understand that most parents need to become *way* more<br/>\nchild-centered and discussions of limits and boundaries are not terribly<br/>\nuseful for getting to radical unschooling, sometimes the pendulum seems<br/>\nto go too far in that direction, imo.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been others, similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t encourage or support or think lovely thoughts about people who want <br/>\nto ignore their children&#39;s needs and say &quot;because I&#39;m an unschooler,&quot; and it <br/>\nseems that some of this discussion of judgement is a cover for that kind of <br/>\nhands-off &quot;parenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107874,"nextTopicId":107958}}
