I had a couple of questions if you guys could help me out I&#39;d appreciate it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far we&#39;ve gotten relaxed about tv, bedtime, chores, food, schoolwork.  When I say relaxed I mean we just stopped given instructions on what to do and how to do it and let the kids make decision about that.  So far it&#39;s gone good, I think.  My oldest son who is 10 really enjoys watching tv and movies.  Right now he&#39;s watching The Wonder Years.  He watched the whole first season yesterday and woke up this morning starting the 2nd season.  I&#39;ve talked to him about it and he likes the relationship between Kevin and Winnie and he likes watching the kids when they are at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is what interesting things can I show him or put out for him that could help him get more of what he&#39;s looking for.
