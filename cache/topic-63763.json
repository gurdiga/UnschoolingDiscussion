He has always been one to not give up lightly so he refused. Of course she used her power and he sat on the floor while she sat on the chair. He never went back and knew that school was not completely for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went to  a Montessori kindergarten and liked it fine as long as they left him alone to do his tasks.When they didn&#39;t then he would no longer want to be there. As it turned out he came home half way through because his sisters were coming home. They have never looked back. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere cousin whose mother is a teacher comes over and for a long time they would play teacher. I noticed the teacher was always bossy, pushy,and demanding. The cousin would play the teacher or a really defiant kid in class.Guess they worked it out cause now they just play Yu Gi Oh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTim and Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stillwaters.ca\">http://www.stillwaters.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63694,"nextTopicId":63764}}
