It virtually kills <br/>\nit --he will not have a bowel movement for days, even a week, if we <br/>\nleave it unattended. And from there, his body reacts so violently to <br/>\nthe reaction that he will have asthma for weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stopped buying regular bread altogether because he looooooooooves the <br/>\nsmell of freshly baked bread (I&#39;m a chef and love baking). And, to make <br/>\nmatters worse, I was in denial about what wheat does to me as well --it <br/>\nis said that children are born with allergies that their mothers <br/>\ndevelop during their pregnancies. I not only developed an intolerance <br/>\nto EGGS (I used to eat one almost every day) which I  thought was <br/>\nchronic fatigue syndrome but also developed IBS  (which I thought was a <br/>\n&#39;temporary&#39; bout of gas that lasted 4.5 years) and a rabid Candida <br/>\nthanks to both WHEAT and COW-DAIRY. Oh, and I had post-partum <br/>\ndepression for 4 years (2 years after Evan, 2 after Aidan) that was <br/>\nexacerbated by these foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I know? Under an allopathic doctor they were considered <br/>\nsensitivities and a psychiatrist said that feeling ill would have made <br/>\nmy depression worse. Under homeopathy, the proving that tackles the <br/>\ndepression is also the one that tackles these three food allergies AND <br/>\nreactions; meaning IBS, Candida, pp depression (plus a host of other <br/>\nproblems I had like ciatica and amenorrhea).<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I happy that I cannot have wheat? Let&#39;s put it this way, it makes me <br/>\nsooooo ill, that the way I feel healthy far outweighs my cravings for <br/>\nthe food. I am a human being these days and not a bag of illnesses. <br/>\nThat said, I arm myself with extra doses of homeopathics for the <br/>\noccasional croissant --and prepare myself emotionally to deal with the <br/>\nconsequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there. Once your family finds what healthy is --not just <br/>\nmeans-- they&#39;ll learn to love it and honor it. Evan is 6 years old and <br/>\nwill not even touch spelt for fear of the consequences.

If you are allergic to <br/>\nwheat it does not mean you are allergic to all glutens but gluten, as a <br/>\nmarker, will point to other potential problems.

The lactose in cow-derived products is not only the <br/>\nmost difficult to digest but the most genetically tinkered dairy source <br/>\nknown to humanity. Just because one is allergic to cow-dairy it this <br/>\ndoes not mean that one will be allergic to all dairy --sheep and goat <br/>\ndairy products are viable options. Still I have read of cases where <br/>\nkids where so sensitive to lactose that they were allergic to their <br/>\nmother&#39;s milk (I read this in a &#39;Living Without&#39; magazine, btw).

Our 3 yr. old dd has had a &quot;curse&quot; of eczema since the fall.  It<br/>\n&gt; started because she loved taking baths, so she took a couple a day.  At<br/>\n&gt; the time I thought - why not - I&#39;ll just have a REALLY clean kid.  LOL<br/>\n&gt; Then the eczema came.<br/>\n&gt; Since then we have tried all kinds of creams - herbal and otherwise,<br/>\n&gt; homeopathics, oat baths,,,,etc... most of which helped to a point but<br/>\n&gt; never got rid of it all together.  We have come to the conclusion that<br/>\n&gt; it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we have noticed<br/>\n&gt; dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash worse and ITCHY. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75506,"nextTopicId":75517}}
