The college <br/>\nasked for SAT or ACT scores and instead I submitted a brief letter <br/>\nexplaining why we do not participate in this type of testing.  They <br/>\nalso requested letters from her teachers and a guidance counselor.  I <br/>\noffered to write these, but suggested that since I am <br/>\nteacher/mother/guidance counselor that this might get a little <br/>\nredundant.

The good news is that this class convinced me that I was <br/>\ndefinitely in the wrong graduate program and I switched from English <br/>\nLiterature to Philosopohy the next session.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy test of what counted is what I remember. I can remember tiny <br/>\nlittle details from jobs I held in high school, details that have <br/>\nstuck with me for 40+ years since.  I remember hours and hours spent <br/>\nin the law library doing high school debate team research.  But I can <br/>\nonly remember a few lectures from college, and very few instructors, <br/>\nby name or by anything significant they imparted to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand I vividly recall trying to go over a jump on my <br/>\nhorse, blindfolded, bareback, with my arms folded in front of me at <br/>\n13.  I remember my jumping instructor&#39;s face and voice very well, and <br/>\nthat was 45 years ago.  I remember ski instructors from that same <br/>\nperiod and how they taught me to challenge gravity by leaning down <br/>\nthe slope.  I remember art and my art teacher from elementary <br/>\nschool.  I remember weaving at my harness loom in the basement of one <br/>\nof my grade school buildings, a reward granted when we completed our <br/>\nwork quickly.  I remember my debate coach from high school, and one <br/>\nliterature teacher who did some amazing things to inspire a lifelong <br/>\nlove of Shakespeare.  I remember my high school algebra teacher who <br/>\nthrew the book at me, literally, all the way across the room.  I also <br/>\nremember being stunned to learn that I had scored in the 97th <br/>\npercentile on mathematical aptitude in college after being convinced <br/>\nby this algebra teacher that I was a total loser at math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember some Sanskrit poetry from an undergrad course on <br/>\ncomparative literature.  I remember one education psychology speaker <br/>\nwho stood on the table and spoke about how he&#39;d been designated as <br/>\nhaving an IQ two points above a rock, basically, but had, through his <br/>\nown perseverence and determination, earned a PhD in Educational <br/>\nPsychology.  I remember the chain-smoking philosophy professor and <br/>\nhow the ashes fell from his cigarettes as he paced back and forth in <br/>\nfront of the epistomology class.  That class inspired me to write <br/>\ngreat poetry.  I remember the creative writing professor who made <br/>\nsexual advances on me then gave me a D because I refused his <br/>\nadvances.  I remember the department chairman who, learning of this <br/>\nright before I graduated, changed that D to a B.  I worked in the <br/>\ndepartment office so he knew me well and knew my writing abilities. <br/>\nThat was back in the days of paper records and punch cards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember tiny details about the coffee house I helped run in <br/>\nundergrad and grad school; the designs carved into the tables made of <br/>\nwire spools, the finicky sound system, the long nights spent with the <br/>\ncadre of anti-establishment friends and folk musicians who helped run <br/>\nthe place, the smell of the spiced cider we served.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a good memory for anything that registered as important to me, <br/>\nbut I remember little from my college classes, very little indeed.  I <br/>\nremember many things about activities in which I was involved, and <br/>\npeople with whom I made friends, and life lessons that still sustain <br/>\nme, but only snippets of anything that I sat through for all those <br/>\nhours to earn degrees.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling was an easy transition for me, since it was all too clear <br/>\nthat structured institutionalized learning had held little import in <br/>\nmy real life.

I could recall only a handful of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; classroom situations that were significant for me, in the long run.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is sad to me and yet also, I understand it too. It&#39;s the reason so many of us unschool. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t have positive classroom learning experiences to draw on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still contend that teaching combined with the ability to study for oneself is the most <br/>\neffective way to learn (whether that learning comes through a terrific coach in baseball, <br/>\nthrowing pots with a professional cermaics artist or going to grad school in a good <br/>\nprogram).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;        I find it impossible to separate out formal and informal learning this <br/>\n&gt; cleanly. For me it would be like trying to separate out the ways my parents <br/>\n&gt; influenced me into their nature and their nurture, trying to say exactly which <br/>\n&gt; contributed what to who I am today. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I feel about it. And I honestly find the routine of meeting weekly and working <br/>\nthrough a progression of materials helpful. I was learning a lot on my own, but I started <br/>\nfinding that all those I spoke with (I read lots of books with others on line) agreed with <br/>\nme... and that wasn&#39;t enough. I knew there were whole schools and disciplines of thought <br/>\nassociated with my field of study that I couldn&#39;t uncover on my own, wouldn&#39;t discover on <br/>\nmy own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps that&#39;s what makes grad school so satisfying. And it helps that the other <br/>\nstudents enjoy being there and come to class prepared (unlike most undergraduate <br/>\nprograms).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;        To me formal study, especially by the graduate school level, is meant <br/>\n&gt; to integrate with all the other influences on your thinking and your life. The <br/>\n&gt; better it is, the harder it is to tell what difference it made. It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; interactive and personal. Like unschooling! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly! One of the ideological dangers (imo) of unschooling is to be suspicious of all <br/>\neducation conducted by teachers. But it seems to me that whether we self-educate use a <br/>\ntutor do an apprenticeship or take a college course, the goal is the subject evaluation of <br/>\nwhether or not learniing is happening - learning that is meaningful to the student, not just <br/>\na list of courses to be crossed off for a degree.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;        Maybe it&#39;s because I was always studying something or other formally, <br/>\n&gt; at the same time I was having my life.

For example, I supported myself for years <br/>\nas a journalist, though I never took a single journalism course in <br/>\nhigh school or college.  But I knew I could write.  So when I applied <br/>\nfor a job in journalism I simply submitted some sample articles and <br/>\ntook whatever assignments they gave me, learning by the seat of my <br/>\npants, bridging the manual typewriter age into the computer and IT <br/>\nage during my career.  The best lesson I learned about journalism was <br/>\nthat nothing mattered more, in most cases, than the amount of space <br/>\nthat my story would be allowed to take in the publication.  The <br/>\ndeciding element was column inches or word count over content most of <br/>\nthe time.  Even if the story was about life and death.  And I learned <br/>\nto meet deadlines while brutally chopping down and editing my own <br/>\ncopy to fit the space the editor was willing to give me.  I learned <br/>\nthat I could do interviews over the phone or over the internet, but <br/>\nthat the in-person interview was almost always much better for me, <br/>\nthat I could sometimes get three different stories/sales out of an in-<br/>\nperson interview.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;I can really see this. She sounds like she has a clear idea of who <br/>\nshe is and how to get to where she wants to go.&lt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, clear for today, and ever-changing, adapting, adjusting to new <br/>\ninformation.  My daughter also works and has found she learns a great <br/>\ndeal in each job she has taken, if only that she has narrowed down <br/>\nher fields of interest by eliminating those that just don&#39;t appeal to <br/>\nher at all when she is really out there working in that field.  She <br/>\nhas learned a great deal about workplace politics and dealing with <br/>\nsupervisory and subordinate workplace personnel, and accompanying <br/>\nstresses, life lessons that will stay with her.  She has observed <br/>\nthat many of the problems with any career are people problems, not <br/>\nthe work itself.  These are important lessons for anyone.  She has <br/>\ndiscovered that the same work, done in different places, can be very <br/>\ndifferent, as far as enjoyment and job satisfaction go.  And she has <br/>\nlearned that many work skills are best learned on-the-job.  But then <br/>\nshe is more right-brained than left, and more kinesthetic, learning <br/>\nby doing, than auditory or visual.

She had a great experience and the <br/>\nnext semester did the same thing, but added a psychology class. Then <br/>\nshe joined the debate team and a performance singing group. And took a <br/>\nceramics course. Each semester we had to reapply for the &quot;concurrent <br/>\nenrollment&quot; program. She took ceramics every semester - including <br/>\nsummer. When she was 16 her ceramics instructor suggested her for a job <br/>\nopening at Laguna Clay Company, and she was hired.

She is now 16 and is taking <br/>\ntap dancing and musical theater techniques this semester.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy third daughter is now 13 and currently has no interest in community <br/>\ncollege courses - she is very involved with 4H, soccer, Girl Scouts, <br/>\nand her Dungeons and Dragons games.

NY state requires that you list a grade level for your kid each year.  <br/>\nThis year Emily (15yo) is listed as a senior.  She has unschooled in academics <br/>\nfor the last 5 years, but the year before that she attended ps in 7th grade at <br/>\n10yo.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always loosely categorized what she does into subjects for school <br/>\ndistrict paperwork.  I consider her an *adult* in our home, and she is very <br/>\nmature for her age.  She really wants some kind of recognition for graduation.

This is somewhat what I expected to hear and I needed to hear it spelled out. <br/>\nWe have had a combination of schooling (as you know) and have only unschooled in <br/>\nearnest for a year. Perhaps the best way to handle it is to ask him what he wants. When I <br/>\nadded up credits, I found that he (as a mid year junior technically) is only 1 and a half <br/>\ncredits from &quot;graduation&quot; as far as schools go. What he &quot;needs&quot; is stuff he&#39;s already doing <br/>\non his own so there won&#39;t be any trouble completing those credits (if we are going to go <br/>\nthat route). But I found myself wondering whether it would be meaningful for him or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest change for us in the last few weeks is that he has become clearer about what <br/>\nhis future employment will be and is working hard on that (video gaming) now. He <br/>\ndropped a class, dropped a sport and is giving lots of time to computers and learning <br/>\nKlingon. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are invited to a graduation planning meeting for next year for his peer group of <br/>\nhomeschoolers and it got me thinking about whether that is even relevant for him. I <br/>\nwondered if closure of any kind is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks! (I&#39;d be interested in other opinions as well.)<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I used to think we should do something graduationish for Kirby&#39;s 18th <br/>\n&gt; birthday, but Keith and I talked about it, and it might seem like we were &quot;graduating <br/>\n&gt; him&quot; from being our kid, and we don&#39;t want to do that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His learning isn&#39;t finished.
