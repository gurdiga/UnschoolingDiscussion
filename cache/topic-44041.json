LOL<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Why would an unschooler choose the path of  medicating their children?<br/>\n  There&#39;s no need for ritalin, since the child doesn&#39;t need to be <br/>\n  confined in a classroom and forced to sit and behave.  There&#39;s no <br/>\n  need for medication for Tourettes, since there is no classroom to be <br/>\n  complaining about the child&#39;s tics.  Please tell me, why do you <br/>\n  choose to medicate?<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is very rare to hear that parents of schooled children take the <br/>\n  stand of not-medicating their children, because they are usually <br/>\n  pressured to do so by the school system.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Ideally, if there&#39;s such a list out there, I&#39;d like to join which <br/>\n  advocates for attachment parenting, unschooling, healthy living, <br/>\n  homesteading, with gifted special needs children.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Merilyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;N.McV.&quot; &lt;nmcvick@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Many homeschooling parents choose to use medication as part of <br/>\n  therapy for disorders such as ADD and Tourettes.

Good <br/>\nfor you for not accepting them in regards to your son and it sounds like you <br/>\nknow your decision already is the right one. I&#39;m sure your son will prosper <br/>\ngreatly from that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you mentioned that your son is not the monster the teachers make him <br/>\nout to be, it made me think of my son too. I think most of the time, any <br/>\nchild who will not do exactly as they are told and sit still in the <br/>\nclassroom will be labeled something. Whether it&#39;s ADHD or just hard to <br/>\ncontrol, etc. My husband and I joke a lot to ourselves on how if our son was <br/>\nin school, we would be there every day. I don&#39;t think they would label him <br/>\nADHD but I have no doubt they would find him hard to deal with. He hasn&#39;t <br/>\ngrown up having someone tell him what to do all the time and just wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nsit well at all with being corraled and roped and tied up all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure exactly how I feel about the whole &quot;is ADD and ADHD real or <br/>\nnot?&quot; I&#39;ve heard a lot of the aruguments on how it is very real and how many <br/>\nthink there is no such thing. I must say I tend to sway to the latter. Then <br/>\nagain I think there are very real circumstances where people and children <br/>\ncan benefit from some type of medication.
