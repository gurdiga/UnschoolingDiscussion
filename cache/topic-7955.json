I ran HUD-subsidized housing <br/>\nfor years and we would just set up an account with a local company (check the <br/>\nYellow Pages).  You have to get the prospective renter to sign an agreement <br/>\nstating that their credit will be checked.  The company you use will probably <br/>\nhave standard agreements that you can use for examples.  If the person&#39;s <br/>\ncredit is bad enough that you won&#39;t rent to him/her, you have to let them <br/>\nknow that they are being turned down, but you do not show them the copy of <br/>\ntheir credit report.  They are responsible for contacting the company and <br/>\ngetting a copy (it is free to them if they are turned down for bad credit).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some pretty amazing credit reports.  I had one woman living in one <br/>\nof the projects who wanted her boyfriend to move in with her.  I checked his <br/>\ncredit, and he owed over $30,000 (!!!) in back child support.  He was only 22 <br/>\nyears old!  Evidently he had children with 8 different women.  All the kids <br/>\nwere about the same age (about 3 yrs old), so he must have had a mighty <br/>\npowerful urge to spread his seed at some point.  He was turned down to rent <br/>\nwith us - NOT because of his prolific paternity habits, but because he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t pay off the bad debt.  The girlfriend who wanted him to live with <br/>\nher (she was one of the 8) knew about all the other 7 and didn&#39;t care.  In <br/>\nfact, she frequently babysat for the other kids!  I don&#39;t think I would be <br/>\nquite so understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** KiM ***<br/>\nruns with scissors</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7954,"nextTopicId":7956}}
