With the exception of<br/>\nliking her teacher, the only other thing she seemed to mention constantly<br/>\nwas the child that was continually in trouble.  I didn&#39;t send her to school<br/>\nto focus on that.  I don&#39;t remember there being a lot of fighting from her<br/>\nwhen we decided to homeschool.  It seemed that the only time the subject was<br/>\nbrought up was when she had been around ps children.<br/>\nMy second child I homeschooled for 1 year and because of other happenings, I<br/>\nthought I would put him in ps.  I, like you, had nightmares and uneasy<br/>\nfeelings about the whole situation.  I should have listened to my<br/>\nuneasiness.  Six weeks into ps, &quot;THEY&#39; decided that my ds needed to be put<br/>\nback into the 1st grade.  Needless to say we pulled ds out of ps. <br/>\nUnfortunately he still feels as if he &quot;doesn&#39;t do well at ps&quot;.
