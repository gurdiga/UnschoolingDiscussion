If an adult goes back on the<br/>\nagreement the adult can have some legal action taken against them. Though<br/>\nadults may feel ethically bound to a contract, the real issue is that<br/>\nthey&#39;re legally bound. A child isn&#39;t legally bound until they&#39;re 18 (or 16<br/>\nmaybe or it may depend on the state).<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of legal obligations are obligations we *choose* to accept. The<br/>\nobligations aren&#39;t forced on us as in a contract we&#39;ve signed. We *decide*<br/>\nto adhere to the obligations because it suits our internal sense of<br/>\nrightness to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone makes us stick to an obligation then it isn&#39;t a moral choice.<br/>\nIt&#39;s something that&#39;s being forced on us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs adults we get to choose. If you promised to do something you&#39;d *choose*<br/>\nto follow through. Which means that you *could* choose not to follow through<br/>\nbut you are *freely* choosing to make the sacrifice to follow through.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Lots* of people equate not wanting the alternative chocies with not having<br/>\na choice. They aren&#39;t the same at all and it muddles thinking to mix the two<br/>\ntogether. Choosing to stay home when the door is unlocked because you prefer<br/>\nto stay home is not the same as staying home because you can&#39;t get out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is forced to follow through then their free choice is taken away.<br/>\nThey *aren&#39;t* honoring an obligation but doing what they&#39;re told.

It brought <br/>\nme great happiness.  This involved some considerable cost in the process, <br/>\nbecause I really loved choosing handmade papers, wanted a hand drill, had to get <br/>\nthe string and the right glue and all sorts of fun tools to do it.  I made a <br/>\nbunch of little books and then didn&#39;t do any more.  I think I move on to <br/>\ndecoupage for a while, but what I wanted to do with that - make little treasure boxed <br/>\nout of torn children&#39;s books - was too tedious to hold my attention and the <br/>\nglue bothered my lungs.  I spent time and energy collecting colored on and <br/>\nripped children&#39;s books from garage sales, collected shoe boxed and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see, I also tried knitting when I broke my ankle.  Got lots of fun <br/>\nyarn.  I really like yarn.  I really don&#39;t like knitting.  It was really just a <br/>\nprelude to weaving anyway.  Now I&#39;m weaving - spent a whole ton of money on a <br/>\nused loom, buy yarn and work to my heart&#39;s content on it.  It also brings me <br/>\ngreat happiness.  I&#39;ve made three baby blankets now and am going to do two or <br/>\nthree more before moving on to rag rugs.  I&#39;ve been saving rags and old clothes <br/>\nfor years in anticipation <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just the last two years, maybe, of my endeavors.  Before that it <br/>\nwas canning (which I still do), picking (which I don&#39;t do anymore, but was <br/>\nprolific at for a while), needlepoint, cross-stitch, bike riding, braided rag rugs, <br/>\nwatercolor painting, etc.  My husband may roll his eyes at my whims and <br/>\ninterests, but he loves my enthusiasm and my need to be creative.  (&quot;This one is <br/>\ngoing to change my live, dear!)  He&#39;s never held me to doing something I grew <br/>\ntired of.  He&#39;s never forced me to complete a project because I spent good money <br/>\non it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned a lot in my time with these courses of study.  Even if I didn&#39;t <br/>\nstay with it.  I&#39;m happy to have done everything I&#39;ve tried.  Most of all I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned to follow my passion.  Weaving may be it.  Or maybe pottery will be <br/>\nnext, who knows?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you feel if your husband was the one who was interested in <br/>\nphotography (mine was) and took a course or spent thousands of dollars (speaking from <br/>\nexperience) on equipment?  Would you force him to take pictures even if he was <br/>\nno longer interested?  <br/>\n<br/>\nContract or no, you can&#39;t really force a creative impulse that doesn&#39;t exist <br/>\nor has withered away.  My son is five now, loves his violin, but hates <br/>\nlessons.  We stopped the lessons at his three year old request and will start them <br/>\nagain when he thinks he wants them.  Yes, we were out some money, but he learned <br/>\nthat we trust him to learn what he wants to learn at his own pace.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust some of my long winded thoughts.

I<br/>\ndecided that bringing my kids there was not worth keeping my good credit, so<br/>\nI quit going and quit paying. My consequenses was that it was a negative on<br/>\nmy credit.  I could live with that.  I couldn&#39;t live with my kids being in<br/>\nbaby prison.  The woman hated her commitment to the day care, but she did<br/>\nit.

Any suggestions from anyone on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Judie!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one way of looking at it: You&#39;re probably about 3 times as old as he<br/>\nis, so a 2 year commitment to him is like a 6 year commitment to you. What<br/>\nif you signed up for something you realized you didn&#39;t like after a couple<br/>\nof months? How would you feel if your husband insisted you stick with it for<br/>\nthe next 6 years because you signed up for it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make him study this for 2 years a very likely outcome is that he&#39;ll<br/>\nhate photography. Is that worth $500?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;d find some way to drop it and get out of any contract you signed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChildhood should be about exploring the world. Which means being free to<br/>\ndabble in things and try them out. If he feels that trying something means<br/>\nhe&#39;s stuck with it, then he&#39;ll stop trying thing out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2856611,"authorName":"Judie Rall","from":"&quot;Judie Rall&quot; &lt;adonai@...&gt;","profile":"adonai39","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Introducing The Rall Family","postDate":"1062260879","msgId":79510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJpcWphZitoajUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79521,"prevInTime":79509,"nextInTime":79511,"topicId":79510,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I found your group through a friend and think I am going to like it very much.

A little bit about our family.  My husband and I will have<br/>\nbeen married 20 years in November.  He was in the military when we<br/>\nmarried, spent 20 years there and now works for the American Red Cross.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two sons, Josh who is 18, and Ethan who is 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always knew I wanted to homeschool.  When Josh was five, I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nwait to drag out my favorite Tip and Mitten reader.  We&#39;d sit on the<br/>\ncouch every day, and I&#39;d read to him, and try to teach him the sound<br/>\nof each letter, and help him put it all together.  But each reading<br/>\nsession would end with him in tears.  I decided he was too young, and<br/>\nput it off until the next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was six, we tried again.  Once again, each session ended in<br/>\ntears.  I wondered, what am I doing wrong?  I decided to just let it<br/>\ngo.  By the time he was about eight, he finally caught on to what I<br/>\nhad been trying to show him before, and we were off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started out using the Abeka curriculum, but I soon learned that I<br/>\nhated it.  If it was boring me, I was sure it was boring him.  We<br/>\ncontinued with &quot;traditional&quot; homeschooling until he was eleven.  One<br/>\nday we were sitting at the table struggling with 5th grade math, and I<br/>\njust couldn&#39;t understand why he couldn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;.  I got angry and<br/>\nyelled at him, &quot;You are going to school next year, and that&#39;s that!&quot; <br/>\nI was convinced it was his laziness, coupled with my obviously<br/>\nineffective teaching technique that was the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe enrolled him in a local Christian school.  They said their<br/>\ncurriculum was a year ahead of the local public schools.  So even<br/>\nthough he had been doing 5th grade work, they put him back in 4th<br/>\ngrade.  So here he was, and almost 12 year old in 4th grade.  That was<br/>\nbad enough, but the worse part was, he wasn&#39;t getting any better in<br/>\nmath.  That first year was so hard on his self-esteem, I&#39;m so sorry I<br/>\nmade him go through that.  By that time, we&#39;d had Ethan, and it only<br/>\nmade sense for Ethan to go to school too, that way I could have them<br/>\nboth in school and I could finish my college degree.  He went to<br/>\nKindergarten every day and came home crying because he missed me so<br/>\nmuch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe spent five years of our life at that school.  And I now regret each<br/>\nday that we wasted there.  By the end of the last year, we were all<br/>\nworn out from school, going to bed early, getting up early, and all<br/>\nthat horrendous homework!  Their curriculum was demanding to begin<br/>\nwith, and then there was so much homework.  We spent the whole evening<br/>\ndoing it, and I really felt like we were homeschooling again because<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t understanding everything they learned during the day and<br/>\nI&#39;d have to go over it with them again at night.  I might as well have<br/>\nsaved myself the money and just homeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we left, Josh had just finished 8th grade, and barely passed<br/>\npre-alegra with a D.  The only way he passed was that they allowed the<br/>\nstudents to correct their homework papers and turn them in again for a<br/>\nbetter grade.  We struggled and struggled with math, and I finally saw<br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t his laziness or my ineffectual teaching.  He just<br/>\nWASN&#39;T GOOD AT MATH!  Horror of horrors, was his life ruined forever?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, my son was 16 years old, almost 17 and just completed 8th grade.<br/>\n  If it took him four more years to complete high school, he&#39;d be<br/>\nalmost 21 when he finished.  So I thought about it.  What are they<br/>\ngoing to teach him in high school that he really needs?  When we quit<br/>\nthe school and went back home, I told them they didn&#39;t have to study<br/>\nanything they didn&#39;t want to.  That whole first year we did pretty<br/>\nmuch nothing that looked academic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second year, Ethan said that he thought he&#39;d like to start doing<br/>\nsome actual school work again.  We signed up with an online school,<br/>\nGoddess Mooncircle Academy, and took just reading, spelling and math.<br/>\n We finished those books before the first semester was over, so I told<br/>\nhim he could go on to 7th grade work.  By that time, he was twelve,<br/>\nand I guess starting to feel like an almost-teenager, starting to feel<br/>\na little more laid back.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the bottom line is, Josh skipped everything that you could<br/>\nconsider to be &quot;high school.&quot;  He&#39;s 18 now.  He&#39;s been out looking for<br/>\na full time job, hasn&#39;t found one yet but we put in applications every<br/>\nday.  When he fills out the portion of the job application that says<br/>\n&quot;high school&quot; I guiltily put that he &quot;graduated&quot; in May 2003.  I feel<br/>\nthat he is going to learn so much more at a job than in school.  He<br/>\nchats with a lot of kids online and likes to brag that he doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto &quot;finish&quot; school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw some ads for PCDI on television, that&#39;s Professional Career<br/>\nDevelopment Institute.  Josh decided he wanted to take their Computer<br/>\nRepair course, so we ordered it for him.  He&#39;s completed the first<br/>\nthree chapters and tests.  He studies on it when he wants to.  After<br/>\nhe completes a chapter and test, I go through and check it.  If there<br/>\nare any errors, I correct them and we send the test in.  Then we<br/>\nreview the parts he missed.  But mostly he studies on his own.  I just<br/>\nquiz him when necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nEthan is only 13, but was very excited about getting to study whatever<br/>\nhe wanted, so we ordered the career photography course for him.  He<br/>\nwas initially excited about it, but I think he underestimated just how<br/>\nmuch reading and book learning there would be to it because it&#39;s hard<br/>\nto get him to sit down and study it.  I think he thought it would be<br/>\nall taking pictures and no book studying.  Anyway, I try to remind him<br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t make him choose this course, in fact he didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nchoose anything.  But he DID choose this, and we are paying $28 a<br/>\nmonth for two years so he can take the course.  I am kind of caught<br/>\nbetween realizing that he needs to be free to study or not study as he<br/>\nchooses, and realizing that we are paying over $500 for this course<br/>\nbecause he said he wanted it, and am tempted to &quot;make&quot; him sit down<br/>\nand study.  Any suggestions from anyone on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to be so happy when Josh finally does get a job, I&#39;ll write<br/>\na book called, &quot;Ditch School and Get a Job&quot; or something.  I want to<br/>\nwrite a success story about him, about how school made him feel like<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t measure up, but how he skipped high school and became<br/>\nsuccessful all on his own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, didn&#39;t mean to go on so long.  I&#39;ll enjoy getting to know you all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJudie C. Rall<br/>\nwww.unhinderedliving.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79632,"nextTopicId":79660}}
