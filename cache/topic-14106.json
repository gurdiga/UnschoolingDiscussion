My son got measles from a child who was vaccinated.  He was<br/>\nsick, yes.  But not nearly as sick as I am atm with bronchitis.  We tried<br/>\n8 times to get him chickenpox before it took.  I had all of the childhood<br/>\ndiseases (and then the vaccinations, go figure).  And I was not a<br/>\n&quot;healthy&quot; child, having had asthma from a very young age.  The vaccines<br/>\nare wonderful for the nonhealthy kids.  And I know that even healthy<br/>\npeople died from these diseases at times.  But the risks we, as a<br/>\npopulation, are taking in assuming that mass vaccination programs are the<br/>\nbest way to go are unknown.  I just read the new book _Flu_ about the<br/>\ninfluenza epidemic of 1918, and one theory as to why it mainly killed the<br/>\nyoung people in their 20s and 30s is that their had been a previous<br/>\npandemic in 1890 (I think) and the older people, who it would be assumed<br/>\nwould suffer from flu more than the young and healthy, had partial<br/>\nimmunity to that particular strain as the two strains appeared to be<br/>\nrelated/similar.  I dunno.  Makes some sense to me.  I also know that the<br/>\nless I teach (or rather, the fewer hours I spend on campus) any given<br/>\nsemester, the more and worse I get sick.  I assume it is because I don&#39;t<br/>\nget multiple and smaller exposures to whatever is going around by not<br/>\nbeing on campus.  I don&#39;t have a person in line behind me sneeze and get<br/>\nexposed that way, which fires up my immune system.  Instead, some sick<br/>\nstudent wanders into my office, coughs up a lung all over me, hands me a<br/>\npaper covered with her germs, etc., and whammy.

Not a one of them came down with the<br/>\nmeasles, much to our disappointment. Seems that there was not much we could<br/>\ndo so that our healthy, breastfed kids would actually contract this &quot;dread&quot;<br/>\ndisease (which my mom had without incident, as well as mumps and rubella).<br/>\nDitto with chickenpox - I&#39;ve tried to get natural immunity for my<br/>\nson, but he just can&#39;t seem to catch it. I mean I&#39;m glad the vaccines are<br/>\navailable. If my child was immune-compromised or somehow at risk for serious<br/>\ncomplications, I would probably be glad I had the choice to use them.
