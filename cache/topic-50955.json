John Holt wrote to his friend Ivan Illich <br/>\nin 1972: &quot;... In working for the kind of changes we want, for a <br/>\nconvivial society and a nonsuicidal technology, you and I may have <br/>\nslightly different functions.

They school them to confuse process and <br/>\nsubstance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the <br/>\nmore treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation <br/>\nleads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching <br/>\nwith learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with <br/>\ncompetence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His <br/>\nimagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value. <br/>\nMedical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the <br/>\nimprovement of community life, police protection for safety, military <br/>\npoise for national security, the rat race for productive work. <br/>\nHealth, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are <br/>\ndefined as little more than the performance of the institutions which <br/>\nclaim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on <br/>\nallocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, <br/>\nand other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIvan Illich - Deschooling Society (1973: 9)<br/>\n<br/>\nRead more about Illich at these websites:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/illich/deschool/intro.html\">http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/illich/deschool/intro.html</a> <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~ira/illich/\">http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~ira/illich/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-illic.htm\">http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-illic.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/illich/profile.html\">http://philosophy.la.psu.edu/illich/profile.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To deschool means to abolish the power of one person <br/>\nto oblige another person to attend a meeting.&quot; - Ivan Illich <br/>\n<br/>\nNorma<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SosinkyHS\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SosinkyHS</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50924,"nextTopicId":50974}}
