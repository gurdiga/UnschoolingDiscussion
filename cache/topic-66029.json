Lots of soft beach and western children for your son to play with (if finding other children is what you are looking for). Hanoi in the north is a serene city with parks. There is also a city in the middle somewhere which has a lot of parks and a river running through, but I can&#39;t remember the name now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are determined to stay, you do at least need to find somewhere that is safe for your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more question though- how happy does your son seem?<br/>\n<br/>\nVanessa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8 Mar 2012, at 09:53, Schuyler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s.waynforth@...\">s.waynforth@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They are home hardly at all.
