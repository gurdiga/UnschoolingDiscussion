If you go to a good<br/>\nart store like Aaron Brothers, as against a craft supplier like<br/>\nMichaels, you will probably find a selection of very beautiful leather<br/>\nbound portfolios with acid free black paper, and often acid free acrylic<br/>\nsleeves, possibly with a zip closure - that helps to keep dust out of<br/>\nthe portfolio. His photos ideally should be 8x10 one to a page. Start<br/>\nwith the best ones, because sometimes the interviewer will only glance<br/>\nat the first few shots. Have a photo to leave with the interviewer, or a<br/>\nphoto postcard with all information. On the back of the photo include<br/>\ncontact information and resume info as it increases, or a list of<br/>\nsatisfied customers and references. It is ok to group photos by type<br/>\nwith a title page before the photos. Eg: Animal Portraits, Insects,<br/>\nEnvironments, Humor - gosh I don&#39;t know. It is perfectly allowable, in<br/>\nfact a good idea, to change the order of your photos depending on who<br/>\nyou are showing them to. For this reason look at clip ring binders as<br/>\nthe page fastening, or ease of sliding pages in and out. Sometimes<br/>\npeople have the kind of folio that converts to a little easel. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow which is better. Personally I like getting closer to the image I am<br/>\nlooking at, but that is just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll these expenses are tax deductible as soon as he starts earning money<br/>\nfrom it, or seeking to earn money from it, as jobsearch expenses. Also<br/>\nany special clothing if he going out into the wild, printing expenses,<br/>\nsoftware used for creating photos or flyers, a portion of the cost of<br/>\ncomputer hardware, mailing expenses, quite aside from his actual<br/>\nphotographic equipment. Also tax deductible: chemicals and paper. If he<br/>\nends up with a room set aside as a dark room, a commensurate portion of<br/>\nhis rent, mortgage, utility bills etc will be deductible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Digest Number 4094","postDate":"1065769981","msgId":82646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzOGVmZCRmMTliMWIxMCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PGJtNWU5ZitvamgxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":82645,"nextInTopic":82647,"prevInTime":82645,"nextInTime":82647,"topicId":82527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2063734598\">&lt;&lt;Robyn, where can we get that magazine?

Avoid the head on <br/>\nshots, animals tend to reflect the red eye in photographs.

I apologize for not<br/>\nbeing <br/>\nclear with my words when I asked how to get started, I meant researching<br/>\nthe <br/>\ntopic not taking pictures. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, this puts a whole different spin on it, although I still<br/>\nrecommend subscribing to photog&#39;y mags as a way to hear about job<br/>\nvacancies and competitions. There are also online competitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if he could apprentice to a local photographer of weddings or<br/>\nchild portraits - as the pet portrait specialist? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other first step that I would recommend to any and all &quot;creatives&quot;<br/>\nis to immediately begin putting together your portfolio. Presentation is<br/>\nvery important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOff the top of my head starting from the place of &quot;People who do stuff<br/>\nwith animals&quot; rather than &quot;people who buy/publish photos&quot; might also be<br/>\na second path towards an income. I&#39;m thinking put up a flyer at the vets<br/>\nor local kennels offering his services to members of the public.<br/>\nReputable animal breeders could receive a flyer or give advice, people<br/>\nshowing their animals at shows and county fairs, here comes my bias -<br/>\npeople who train animals for film or tv always need good photos, rescue<br/>\ncenters and pet adoption places, dog groomers (before and after???) <br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at my Humane Society calendar and all the photos of gorgeous<br/>\nanimals are credited to different photographers with agencies/firms or<br/>\ntheir own name as the company. A partial list: Rural Images; FPG<br/>\nInternational - Getty Images Inc.; Ron Kimball Photography. It may be<br/>\nworth writing to people for advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4094","postDate":"1065680801","msgId":82566,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzOGUyZSQ1MDlmNDFjMCQzNDAwYThjMEByb2J5bm1hY2hpbmU+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFhLjIzM2U3YjhjLjJjYjVmNzUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":82563,"nextInTopic":82568,"prevInTime":82565,"nextInTime":82567,"topicId":82527,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1014570180\">&lt;&lt;Does anyone here have a child that has been or is interested in<br/>\nphotography? <br/>\nChristopher has decided that he would like to be a photographer of<br/>\nanimals <br/>\nonly and not a vet but we don&#39;t know where to start.
