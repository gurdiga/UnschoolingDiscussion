I am still really just trying<br/>\nto come up with a way to do things in my home, not saying that you didn&#39;t do<br/>\nit right, but that I noticed that you did respond.  I also do not want to<br/>\nhold on to resentment or anything, that is not good for the children or me.<br/>\nBut, I guess what I saw in your post is a way to let Marty know what you<br/>\nwere thinking/feeling but not punishing or judging.  The only difference in<br/>\nmy family is that I am not sure I know how to let them know without the<br/>\nperception that I am judging what they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know now from other posts that the reason you are able to do this is<br/>\nbecause of your relationship with Marty, and that is as it should be.  It is<br/>\njust different coming to this in the middle of the teen years and I am<br/>\ntrying to figure out how to do it for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think that my children and I have a good relationship, but it obviously<br/>\ncould use some work in these areas.

I noticed when you gave<br/>\nthe story about asking Marty to get something for you and he didn&#39;t respond<br/>\nkindly, you wanted to make sure he knew that.

We<br/>\nhave not totally unschooled before (I was one of those unschooling except<br/>\nfor math and writing folks, sorry), but they did learn to read on their own,<br/>\nI have never pushed school type readers (though they have read a whole set<br/>\nof them someone gave us, just because they enjoyed them, and they did three<br/>\n&quot;years&quot; worth of these readers in about a month, and skipped what they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like, etc.)  Not trying to brag here, just trying to let you know<br/>\nthat I do understand unschooling and I know they will never sit down and do<br/>\nschool like school is done in schools.  Fortunately, I would never be able<br/>\nto handle that anyway.  We have used curriculum over the years, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink we have ever used it in the way it was fully intended to be used.  We<br/>\nare not using any curriculum now though, and stopped because I realized I<br/>\nwas moving toward too much structure(kids who would be in high school if<br/>\nthey went to school jitters) and my children made it very apparent that it<br/>\nwould not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I making any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for your help,<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56075,"nextTopicId":56327}}
