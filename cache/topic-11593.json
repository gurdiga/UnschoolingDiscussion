These <br/>\nare just off the top of my head:  How much paint do we need?  How many <br/>\ncolors?  What shapes are the areas of wall/floor/ceiling we are covering?  <br/>\nHow do they all fit together?   Show how to figure out the area.  (even if 7 <br/>\nyr old doesn&#39;t understand the multiplication concept, he/she can see how the <br/>\npuzzle goes together).  Maybe use tangrams or diagrams to show how it will <br/>\nall look when you are finished.  Perhaps make a scale model of the rooms you <br/>\nare doing.  Show how to use a scale ruler (one side shows inches, other side <br/>\ndifferent scale).  Measure the rooms/walls/ceilings.  You&#39;re going to need <br/>\nthat information in order to get the pain anyway...have that 7 yr old holding <br/>\nand reading the tape measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow long did it take us to cover x amount of wall space?  How long will it <br/>\ntake to cover all walls?  What is cost per gallon?  Cost for entire project?  <br/>\nLet 7 yr old help pay for materials and count back change.  (if that&#39;s too <br/>\nmuch hassle at the store, replay the scene at home while encouraging 7 yr old <br/>\nto direct the scene...it will tell you volumes about how much he/she <br/>\nunderstands and give you a chance to teach/correct any misunderstandings).<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage arts gets covered by talking while you work!

You can relate math skills by letting him <br/>\nlearn how to measure rooms, furniture pieces, etc...let him select household <br/>\nitems from catlogs and record prices, then figure the cost of items per room. <br/>\n Let him learn how to figure how many gallons of paint it may take to paint a <br/>\nroom;  and how much wallpaper it will take to cover the walls.  Maybe he can <br/>\ndesign some ideas for his room, too, and sketch them on paper, then add a <br/>\nwritten explanation about his ideas.
