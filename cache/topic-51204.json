Usually about 11:00 or 11:30.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When a family let the kid stay up late, Holly was fine.  She would play<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; then fall asleep talking.

A couple of times she cried in the morning<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; she would have liked to have been there for breakfast and more playing.<br/>\n&gt; When it was walking distance, sometimes she went back.  Other times, we<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; comforted her and said &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My mom would have said &quot;NO&quot; to overnighters if I had gotten that way.  But<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; think of it this way:  I preferred an overnight visit in a scary,<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable house to being home many times because I wasn&#39;t let out<br/>\nenough<br/>\n&gt; and I was curious and needy for knowing about other people and other<br/>\nplaces.<br/>\n&gt; Holly isn&#39;t needy, and she feels safer and more comfortable in her own<br/>\nhouse<br/>\n&gt; than I did.   So I look at what&#39;s good about it instead of what&#39;s a<br/>\nfailure<br/>\n&gt; and an irritation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Holly asked me when she was already pretty old, like seven or so, how<br/>\npeople<br/>\n&gt; go to sleep.  &quot;How do people go to sleep when they want to, mom?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was talking to her about breathing more shallowly and stilling her mind,<br/>\n&gt; getting comfortable and warm, thinking about feeling the way you do when<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re asleep... and somewhere in there it came up that she didn&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; people closed their eyes.

They&#39;ve lived it.   Several of these long time posters have done it for 10 years or longer!        <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve only been doing this whole unschooling life for maybe 6 months and I know I don&#39;t know a fraction of what Sandra or Tia or Ren (and others) know.     I probably post too much,     but you know what?   I am learning so much! I am glad that Ren posts her evenings and Sandra too.  They aren&#39;t telling me that what I do is wrong,  they are just saying that these types of things are working for them.  And these things are definitely unschooling things in an unschooling life.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve gathered on some of these struggles/conflicts, not just this one, but others that have come up also, not just you Teresa, is that when people are new to unschooling it seems that unschooling is  separate from the rest of their life.  And I am not saying your life is this way. I don&#39;t know your life.   I am talking in generalities.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that when I started, I thought our unschooling would only be the way we learned about things,  well, for us to unschool successfully, it has come into our whole life, all aspects--parenting, working, playing--basically living life.  And perhaps this is where the conflict lies,   perhaps different parenting styles and lifestyles do work successfully, but the question is -- will these different parenting styles and lifestyles actually foster a successful unschooling environment??  And, I think, that this is what this list is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would think that experience does have some benefits.    I can only look back on the last 6 months or so,  others can look back on years and years.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone can take this with an open heart, I am not trying to be preachy or anything,  I&#39;m just trying to get across what I&#39;ve seen happen a few times.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/12/02 3:19:55 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did question the <br/>\n&gt; term &quot;every family has to do what works for them&quot; as I disagree with that <br/>\n&gt; sentiment.<br/>\n&gt; I have no desire to compare rights or freedoms with anyone.
