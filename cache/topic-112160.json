It is a <br/>\nnew road for me and a very scary one.  I am so afraid that too many days <br/>\nmay go by where she hasnt done anything to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************88<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I might post a bit about our adventures over the past few years in a way that might help &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between your anxiety and unschooling and results.  This is specific to our family, and involves some level of &quot;continuing education&quot; but also demonstrates that unschoolers can get wherever they need to be at any time in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was 16 last year.  He has always hated math and formal writing.  He has spent his time sleeping, sleeping, and more sleeping.  When he is awake, he is on the computer playing games, on the xbox, or watching tv.  He builds bikes and plays video games with his friends.  He does not have a job yet.  He hasn&#39;t gotten his driver&#39;s license either.  He has a girlfriend he likes to spend time with.  And he plays drums in a neighborhood band (he taught himself).  Generally speaking, this is how he has spent his last few years.  A few times, he has gone &quot;trainin&quot; with his buddy who is 30...they go and photograph trains in different train yards, and identify them, learn their history, etc.  Other times, he has helped do some siding jobs with the same buddy. Other hobbies have been biking and skateboarding, hanging out with friends, and fishing/hunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, his &quot;education&quot; has been anything but traditional or conventional and has mostly consisted of &quot;dabbling&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year he enrolled in a college English Comp course at the local community college.  He enrolled as an &quot;early admit&quot; but could not meet the &quot;admission requirements&quot; for &quot;early admits&quot; because he never took the SAT&#39;s and didn&#39;t have a &quot;transcript&quot;.  So, I made a narrative &quot;transcript&quot; of all the things he has done and he took the college placement test for English.  (not SAT&#39;s)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two levels of remediation and he tested into the second level, the one just before qualifying for Eng 101.  This without any formal writing lessons, or at least very few (I also lasped into my anxiety at times).  We were told that most high school *graduates* test into the first level, not the second.  And had it not been for his punctuation, he would have qualified for Eng 101.  After Eng 051, he decided not to pursue any other courses, but he could have, and he could have eventually earned a degree, or transferred into a 4 year school.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, just yesterday, he applied at the local Career and Tech Center (votech).  Last year when we discussed it with the CTC, they said if I graduated him last year (at 16) they would still gladly take him, but it would not be free. I mention this to show that not every &quot;school&quot; thinks like the traditional high school.  They were very willing to work with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we decided to wait another year.  This year we were told that in order for him to have a better chance of acceptance, he should enroll through the high school.  (They take all high schoolers first, and then &quot;adult&quot; students (those that have graduated already).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe high school requires incoming seniors to take the PSSA as juniors to make sure they are all on the same level.  Etown will not graduate any senior who did not pass the junior pssa.  It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if he took it and didn&#39;t pass it, we didnt&#39; care about the Etown diploma.... but we didn&#39;t want to have to deal with any &quot;required mediation&quot; either. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided we really did not want to go down the PSSA road at all, that we would rather avoid this kind of testing which we feel has been detrimental to so many kids. But then, we were afraid he wouldn&#39;t even get into the CTC because he&#39;d be enrolling as an adult student.  The CTC recommended we talk to the high school again and see what they would say, so I did. Low and behold, since we do not want an Etown diploma, we do NOT have to take the PSSA.  We merely need to apply to the CTC like anyone else in any other high school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the bottom line is, my unschooling 17 year old is going to go to the CTC next year and learn a trade, graduate, and start working in the real world as a second year apprentice, and proceed from there.  The average pay for his chosen programs ranges from $17-$50/hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that he unschooled and didn&#39;t have all the traditional stuff doesn&#39;t even matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248175779,"authorName":"nrskay","from":"&quot;nrskay&quot; &lt;k_bird@...&gt;","profile":"nrskay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: new to homeschooling need some advice","postDate":"1140220842","msgId":112243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0NW8zYSs1ZnVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQzRjVGMDRBLjgwNDA0MDlAY2hhcnRlci5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":112239,"nextInTopic":112245,"prevInTime":112242,"nextInTime":112244,"topicId":112160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Deana:  I sold all of my textbooks on ebay last summer and I believe I broke even.

Last night I printed out a forum board <br/>\nquestion I posted with the same thing I posted n the emails and printed <br/>\nthe unschooling parents replys.  When he got home he asked his daughter <br/>\nwhat she did in school today.  She said we didnt do any book stuff.  I <br/>\nfelt my heart jump. (hehe why cant kids lie when they need to I <br/>\nthought)  Then I turned to my husband and he said why didnt she do any <br/>\nschool today, and I said she did.  Then I handed him the print out at <br/>\nfirst glance he said so does this mean we have to send her back to <br/>\nschool since your not finding any joy in it.  I told him to read the <br/>\nwhole thing before he said anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he asked, well what if she doesnt show interest in something that <br/>\nis vital for her to learn, for example, proper writing, reading and math <br/>\nproblems.  So I posted that question cause I wasnt sure how to answer <br/>\nthat.  I told him about our day and how much less stressful and fun it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said the kids played out in the blizzard, made snow angels, <br/>\nshoveled.   Then brought some snow in and made snowcream with it.  Then <br/>\nshe played funbrain.com math.  She helped do some chores.  Fed her <br/>\nbrother.  Played with her brother.  (and halfway through the day I <br/>\nstarted to feel irresponsible so I made her color some president <br/>\npictures while I colored with her and then I made her read the facts out <br/>\nloud to me and then I made her sit with the timer on 10 mins and make a <br/>\nbooklet of whatever she wanted.)  She didnt like it but she did it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told him see she did PE, Sharing, Measuring, Math, Cleaning, Caring <br/>\nfor brother.  Watched some TV  learned about presidents and wrote her <br/>\nown story.  So she learned today. :P   I still felt unsure at this <br/>\npoint.  But then I showed him this website I found of The ABC&#39;s of <br/>\nUnschooling.  And the Unschooling Recordkeeper.  Because he was a bit <br/>\nunsure of how you keep grades in unschooling and a bit skeptical that <br/>\nshe may not pass SAT&#39;s if she chooses to go to college some day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin an hour he said, so I take it you dont like the Switched on <br/>\nSchool House - thats all on computer.  I said yes it is on computer but <br/>\nit is still almost all reading and answering questions.  Lynzie hasn&#39;t <br/>\nfound any fun in it and refuses to do it.  So he posted the Switched on <br/>\nSchool House back on Ebay where we bought it from.  He said he feels <br/>\nlike he waisted alot of money buying all the books he bought if we arent <br/>\ngoing to use them.  I told him from what I read alot of families new to <br/>\nhomeschool or and unschool have done the same thing and I can try to <br/>\nsell them at this summers rummage sales.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seemed alot more open to the idea then I thought he would be and <br/>\nsurprised me with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday it is already almost 10am and I am trying so hard to fight the <br/>\nanxiety I feel that I am being irresponsible by letting my daughter <br/>\nwatch tv and basically choose what she wants to do all day.   It is a <br/>\nnew road for me and a very scary one.  I am so afraid that too many days <br/>\nmay go by where she hasnt done anything to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain thank you for your advise and sorry this thread has gotten so <br/>\nlong, It&#39;s just that it is all new to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsahm2cody wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; &quot;My husband is also stressing me out because he doesnt understand<br/>\n&gt;   Unschooling and thinks at home school should be structured with the<br/>\n&gt;   american flag and text book courses.
