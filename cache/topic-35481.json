I may let them know what we are &quot;studying&quot; or doing, i.e. hiking --<br/>\n&quot;We have recently been exploring natural sciences using the different state<br/>\nparks in our area.  We have been exploring how the different eco systems<br/>\nwork both on their own and with each other.  What is your family learning<br/>\nabout?&quot;  or &quot;What is your child studying?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or maybe &quot;My one son has been reading the original version of Journey To<br/>\nThe Center Of The Earth.  I know this is not suggested reading until Middle<br/>\nor High School but he has found it interesting on his own accord and is<br/>\ncapable of reading and understanding it.  What are your children reading?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  And she wrote:<br/>\n  &lt;How about when it&#39;s the kids themselves that keep<br/>\n  telling you they are not learning anything when you know they are? My kids<br/>\n  had previously been in school and play with kids who go to school so I<br/>\nknow<br/>\n  where some of the flack comes from but it is still so hard to deal with.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My reply is:<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son went through this also.  Peer pressure from his friends that go to<br/>\nschool.  He went to K - part of 3rd.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I asked him what did he want that he thought he was missing out on?<br/>\nHomework?  We can do that but we don&#39;t want to or need to.  Drama?  We can<br/>\ndo that at different places to.  Learning how to read?  He knows how.<br/>\nHaving to read what someone tells him to read? He didn&#39;t like that idea.<br/>\nThey are into wresteling - he is not. Baseball?  Did that outside of school.<br/>\nDiploma?  Not a problem - I explained that there are people that have been<br/>\nand are helpful in that area should he need one.  College?  Not there yet -<br/>\nbut he will go if he wishes to.  A good job?  Not there yet either.  But<br/>\nunless he goes to college, the only thing that may matter is being old<br/>\nenough or having a diploma or an idea and the determination to learn what he<br/>\nneeds and to carry out his dream. Age is a matter of time and having a<br/>\ndiploma is not going to be a problem, the rest is up to him when he is<br/>\nready. He finally decided he was not missing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then I had a talk with the friends and explained that this works for us<br/>\nand that this or that may be important to them or thier parents it was not<br/>\nsomething that is required in order to have a normal fulfilling life for<br/>\nsome people.  Come to find out -- they both want to do what we are doing<br/>\ninstead of going to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for my son thinking he is not learning anything ... a little &quot;review&quot;<br/>\nof his life and what we have been doing helped.  I reminded him that he can<br/>\nand is able to do mathamatical equations in his head that I require a<br/>\ncalculator to perform.  I have also asked him things like &quot;Did you know such<br/>\nand such before we read/heard/found out about it?&quot; or I will ask his friends<br/>\nwhat they have been learning in school and relate back to them in front of<br/>\nmy son or later to just him what we have done recently in real life that<br/>\nwould be equivilant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She also wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt; It makes me feel phony when I try to explain to them how them doing this<br/>\nor that is math or history, etc.&gt;<br/>\n  My response is:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then don&#39;t.  If you do and you feel phony it probably comes off as<br/>\nphony -- What if you let them know that putting it this way doesn&#39;t feel<br/>\nright to you -- it feels phony -- but what is school? - a phony way of<br/>\npresenting real life.  What if you let them know that if this was a lesson<br/>\nin school it would fall under the subject of Math or History or Social<br/>\nStudies or Home Economics or Physical Education - but school needs to divide<br/>\nthings or life into subjects in order to study that one entity and it is up<br/>\nto the student to find away to incorporate the information into thier own<br/>\nreal life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps at 14 he knows what he wants but just needs help on how to get<br/>\nthere.  And depending on how long you&#39;ve been Homeschooling or Unschooling<br/>\nmaybe he just needs a break.  Then again if he really feels a need to<br/>\n&quot;study&quot; for something - How does he feel about studying for his GED or the<br/>\nCHSPE (I don&#39;t know what state you are in or what is in your state -- in CA<br/>\nthese are tests for high school completion or equivalency).<br/>\n<br/>\n  And finanlly she wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;Please also help me to find ways to move dh along.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My thoughts are:<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is a problem with my hubby also.  I think pamS has a very good<br/>\nsuggestion in her reply with the suggestion of using Carol Narigon&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;Unschooling Curriculum&quot; on Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Course, I just never even gave him a choice in the matter and continue to<br/>\nexplain to him that school is not at all what it was when he was in school<br/>\n(he&#39;s<br/>\n  now in his 50&#39;s) and perhaps he would like to spend some time going to one<br/>\nto see first hand the things that I myself have witnessed.  And I also<br/>\nremind him of the homework that our son would bring home and how he (hubby)<br/>\nwould say &quot;They had him there for 6 hours - if they can&#39;t teach him in that<br/>\namount of time then what are they doing with that time -- there is no reason<br/>\nhe should need to bring home this work -- this is the time he has to play&quot;<br/>\netc. And then I remind him of my response of &quot;they don&#39;t have time to teach<br/>\nchildren in school ... that is why they send the work home for us to teach<br/>\nthem&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt; BTW, my kids are 11<br/>\n  and 14, both boys.<br/>\n  Laura &gt;<br/>\n  Ours are 32, 11 and 5 - all boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wish you the best in your journeys through life and learning,<br/>\n  Joan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I also have a 9 y.o. son and a<br/>\n7y.o. daughter.  I&#39;m not sure how long it has been since your kids were<br/>\nin school, but I think the de-schooling process takes longer the longer<br/>\nthey were in school.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much, since it is a<br/>\nprocess.  Really listening to them talk about their interests is so<br/>\nimportant.  To overhear their conversations with one another, and to<br/>\nwatch what they do in their spare time, then write it down and be aware<br/>\nof it seems to help me.  Then we attract it like magnets, I think because<br/>\nwhen we see it we recognize it as an interest.  At the beginning of our<br/>\nunschooling odysssey, I said, okay, so how do you want to do it?  The<br/>\nkids said they wanted required reading, writing and math.  So I wrote it<br/>\ndown on the wall for them to remind themselves with.  After a while, they<br/>\nwere only requiring themselves to do math.  Then, as they were spending<br/>\nall their time doing the things they were interested in, they forgot<br/>\nabout the math.  They seem to always have a theme that they are doing. <br/>\nIt usually lasts a week or two, then they are into something new.  It<br/>\nkeeps them busy, and me too.  I&#39;ve taken to writing down what they are<br/>\ndoing and making a weekly unschooling newspaper chronicling it so that I<br/>\ncan show it to my husband or relatives who are clueless about<br/>\nunschooling.  I also print out posts and articles that explain and show<br/>\nhow unschooling works.  I have a little folder I keep these in for<br/>\nreference and show them to my husband as they come up.  <br/>\nBonni</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom]  New question","postDate":"1019466076","msgId":35565,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4OC42ZDhiNTUzLjI5ZjUyYjVjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35549,"nextInTopic":35639,"prevInTime":35564,"nextInTime":35566,"topicId":35481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/21/2002 10:55:31 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

There aren&#39;t any homeschoolers around here that he can relate to, <br/>\nso all of his friends go to school or are finished with it.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsay, but I&#39;m pretty sure he gets a lot of questions about what he studies <br/>\nand stuff.  And I&#39;m sure he gets a lot of brainwashing about school being <br/>\nthe way into a career and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night he asked me if we could get him into a &quot;program&quot; to get <br/>\n&quot;caught up&quot;.  I asked what his purpose was for getting &quot;caught up&quot;, and all <br/>\nhe had was a vague, &quot;I might want to go to university.&quot;  I know this isn&#39;t <br/>\nhim *wanting* to go to university.  It&#39;s him thinking he *should* go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of this problem has been caused by me.  Having panicked when he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nreading at 12, I pushed.  That taught him that I didn&#39;t believe he could <br/>\nlearn to read on his own.  Several months after that, and after I&#39;d come to <br/>\nmy senses and stopped the forced reading practice, he said he might want to <br/>\ngo to school the next year.  I was *really* reluctant to send a kid who was <br/>\nbarely reading and writing to grade 8.  Aside from the problems I figured <br/>\nhe would have coping with the work load, I could just see the teacher&#39;s <br/>\nunion using his lack of skills in language arts to lobby for more control <br/>\nover homeschoolers.  So I told him he needed to be caught up to grade level <br/>\nin the basics before he could go.  Of course now I wonder if maybe I should <br/>\nhave just let him go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m the one who convinced him that he was &quot;behind&quot; and needing to be <br/>\n&quot;caught up&quot;. . . sigh.  Since he&#39;s a kid who doesn&#39;t like to give much <br/>\nfeedback during a conversation, I&#39;ve written him a letter.  I gave it to <br/>\nhim last night, and so far he hasn&#39;t said anything about it.  That&#39;s pretty <br/>\nnormal for him.  He tends to like to think about things for a while.  This <br/>\nis what I wrote to him.  Maybe it will give you some ideas.  Maybe someone <br/>\nwill have more ideas for me.  Who knows.<br/>\n****************************************************************<br/>\nI want to explore this desire you have to get &quot;caught up&quot;. I wonder if you <br/>\nbelieve what the school system believes, that kids are empty vessels who <br/>\nneed certain kinds of knowledge poured into them.  They have to be made to <br/>\nlearn things because learning isn&#39;t any fun.  Well Dad and I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthat&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve watched you absorb knowledge like a sponge since you were <br/>\nlittle.  You probably didn&#39;t realize you were learning things because it <br/>\nwas so easy to do.  When you were in preschool, I realized that the other <br/>\nkids knew the colours, and you didn&#39;t.  I made a mental note to play some <br/>\ncolour games or something with you but didn&#39;t get around to it.  A couple <br/>\nof months later, I noticed that you knew the colours.  It&#39;s been like that <br/>\nwith all kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou still amaze me with your ability to do mental math.  You&#39;re way better <br/>\nthan I am at that. I know that you have more trouble with written-down <br/>\nmath, but most kids do at first.  It&#39;s just a different skill that you can <br/>\nlearn when you need it.  In fact, I&#39;ll bet you could just start right now <br/>\nwith, say, algebra, and work your way through any gaps in your math <br/>\nknowledge as you learned it.  (You couldn&#39;t do that in school because the <br/>\nclass would be moving too fast.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings me to purpose for learning.  You seem to have little trouble <br/>\nfinding out what you want to know about bikes and riding.  You watch.  You <br/>\nask.  You read your magazines.  You read web pages.  You have a purpose, so <br/>\nyou learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids in school have a purpose for learning the stuff they learn.  It&#39;s <br/>\ncalled grades, and it&#39;s totally artificial.  Grades don&#39;t even show what <br/>\nyou&#39;ve actually learned.  They&#39;re just an average of all the scores you get <br/>\non homework and tests in a class.  You can sort of learn everything that&#39;s <br/>\noffered in a course and get a C.  You can also be really good at part of it <br/>\nwhile not understanding the rest at all, and you&#39;ll still probably get a <br/>\nC.  You can ask your brother or sisters how much of it you&#39;d remember next <br/>\nyear, or even next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe follow a different philosophy of learning.  It&#39;s called <br/>\nunschooling.  Some people call it real learning.  Real learning is wanting <br/>\nto know something, finding the answers, and enjoying the process.  You <br/>\nactually do that all the time, though you haven&#39;t done it much so far in <br/>\nthe academic areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the reason you want to get caught up is that you are concerned about <br/>\nyour future, we can work with that. The first thing to do is think about <br/>\nyour strengths. What are you good at? I&#39;ve started a separate list for <br/>\nthat, which we can add to. Then you think about what you like doing. Once <br/>\nyou&#39;ve thought about what you&#39;re good at and like doing, then we can help <br/>\nyou start thinking about your goals. You take what you like and are good <br/>\nat, and explore careers that use those strengths and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next step is to figure out what you need to do in order get started in <br/>\nthat career. If there&#39;s an academic requirement, we can help you meet it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s only at that point that you need to be concerned with &quot;catching up&quot; <br/>\nand then only in the areas that you&#39;re going to need.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about university or technical school? Don&#39;t assume that graduating <br/>\nfrom high school and going on to university is a good way into a career. It <br/>\nrarely is. If you want to be a doctor or lawyer or veterinarian or <br/>\nsomething like that, you&#39;d need university (and a lot more). But there are <br/>\nlots of university grads who still don&#39;t know what they want to be when <br/>\nthey grow up. A lot of them are flipping burgers to pay off their student <br/>\nloans. University is expensive. And for a person who doesn&#39;t use reading <br/>\nand writing as their preferred way of learning, it can be painful.  I&#39;m <br/>\nsure you could do it if it was your only path into your chosen career, but <br/>\nthere are probably ways that would work better for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of jobs that pay well that don&#39;t involve university. <br/>\nElectricians, plumbers, welders, sound technicians, for instance. Those <br/>\nusually involve a short college course and then maybe an apprenticeship. <br/>\nYou get paid during an apprenticeship, and you learn by doing. The book <br/>\nlearning is minimal for those kinds of jobs. They are also physical jobs, <br/>\nwhich you seem to lean toward. I know you don&#39;t want to plant trees for a <br/>\nliving, but there are physical jobs that aren&#39;t so hard on your body and <br/>\npay better.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also have a very good business sense that could be developed if you <br/>\nchose to start your own business. I could see you opening a bike store one <br/>\nday or running eco tours. (Taking groups of people mountain bike camping, <br/>\nfor instance.) I could see you building furniture or houses or . . .  Once <br/>\nyou really start exploring your strengths and interests, you&#39;ll be able to <br/>\nthink of lots of ideas. We can help you figure out how to make your dreams <br/>\ncome true, but you have to find the dreams.<br/>\n***********************************************************************<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6770123,"authorName":"bonknit@aol.com","from":"bonknit@...","profile":"pampmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE: New question","postDate":"1019432050","msgId":35528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Ny5kNDFhMWU1LjI5ZjRhNjcyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35523,"nextInTopic":35538,"prevInTime":35527,"nextInTime":35529,"topicId":35481,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 04/21/2002 7:17:24 PM Eastern Daylight Time, kbmatlock@attbi.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-84933235\">In a message dated 04/21/2002 7:17:24 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbmatlock@...\">kbmatlock@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   We&#39;ve been hsing 3 years, I have a 6yo dd and nearly-11 yo ds, and all<br/>\n the same questions you do. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that much of it has to do with having been in school as I get much <br/>\nmore of it from my 14yro than the 11yro.

A friend came by to play and<br/>\nSean said not now, he was doing school(!) I nearly choked.
