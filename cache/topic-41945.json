Once you find out<br/>\nwhat the requirements are, you can make your practice look as though it<br/>\nconforms. The more the laws (politicians and schools) are against<br/>\nhomeschooling, the more you need to spin your program in order to be<br/>\naccepted. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy recommendation is to ask members of the support groups in your area and<br/>\nsee how they handle it. Find someone whose brand of hsing matches yours and<br/>\nthen see how they accomodate the requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral states leave the education decisions entirely up to the parents. In<br/>\nthose states, you will have little to worry about. In CT, for example, there<br/>\nis not even a need to inform the school that you are homeschooling. There is<br/>\nno requirement even to contact the school at all, unless you are withdrawing<br/>\nthe child, and in that case, a letter that says. &quot;I am withdrawing my child&quot;<br/>\nis sufficient. However, from what we&#39;ve seen on this list, many states have<br/>\nrequirements and forms and deadlines and other hoops for parents to<br/>\nmaneuver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice I&#39;ve heard is this: Whatever the requirements, give the<br/>\nstate (school) as little as they will accept. Have as little contact as<br/>\npossible with school employees. It will help you and it will also help all<br/>\nother homeschoolers.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41884,"nextTopicId":41986}}
