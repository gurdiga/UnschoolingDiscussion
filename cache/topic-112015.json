So an important <br/>\nfirst step for parents is to look inside and see if they really trust <br/>\ntheir child&#39;s process and have the relationship as the top priority.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will most likely happen next, when a parent gets herself and her <br/>\ninner world sorted out a bit, is she will probably want to do have <br/>\nsee and visit things together.

I suppose it has <br/>\nsomething to do with puberty and burgeoning independence, and <br/>\nprobably not having had delicious relationships with ones own parents <br/>\nas adolescents, and then reinforced by the sad fact that most people <br/>\nexpect teens to be trouble and it doesn&#39;t even occur to them that <br/>\nthey could adore their adolescent children as much as their younger <br/>\nones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever the reason, many parents struggle with their teens, <br/>\nunschooling or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor parents who have taken on the legal responsibility of &quot;educating <br/>\ntheir children&quot; (however your state mandates it), it is a convenient <br/>\nway to express our own conflicted-ness about our teens, by worrying <br/>\nabout their &quot;education&quot; - whether they are learning enough, whether <br/>\nthey are curious or generous or busy enough , or whether we know <br/>\nenough to `teach&#39; them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI encourage unschooling parents who are experiencing any kind of <br/>\nconflict with or about their teen (either rumbling around inside the <br/>\nparents&#39; head, or being acted upon in real life), to make a <br/>\ncommitment to put the RELATIONSHIP with this child above everything <br/>\nelse.  (Again!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice again and again that this is harder for parents in the <br/>\nadolescent years, and so I find it helpful for parents to renew their <br/>\nconsciousness and intention about it, before they start trying to <br/>\nfind ways to &quot;be a better unschooler&quot;.  Teens are probably not going <br/>\nto be distracted or entertained by clever strewing or road trips or <br/>\nmovie rentals.  If they are not feeling cherished accepted and <br/>\ntotally supported by their parents, they&#39;ll just ignore or fight with <br/>\na parent who is trying to mask an unsupportive relationship <br/>\nwith &quot;good unschooling practices.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are fun and funny and smart and playful and interesting and <br/>\ninterested and they include me in what they are thinking and doing <br/>\nand we have a great time together and I never wonder if they are <br/>\nlearning enough. BUT I don&#39;t attribute this to my own (or their ) <br/>\nsmarts or curiosity or strewing or adventures (although I do all <br/>\nthose things too) - I believe it absolutely begins in our love for <br/>\neach other.  My relationships with my kids are based completely in <br/>\ntrust and love, which (as has already been said on this list a <br/>\nzillion times) matters WAY more than anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd FROM this loving foundation my kids continue to unfold and <br/>\nblossom into amazing human beings.
