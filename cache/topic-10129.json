I&#39;d recommend &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; more for &quot;handholding<br/>\n&gt; purposes than anything else.  I&#39;d recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work:<br/>\nTaking<br/>\n&gt; Children&#39;s Choices Seriously&quot; and my own (below) if you want a chronicle<br/>\nof how<br/>\n&gt; unschooling approaches can work (with lots of examples), as well as John<br/>\nHolt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; books (Holt, by the way, used the terms &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\n&gt; interchangeably -- it was only later, in the 1980s when large numbers of<br/>\n&gt; fundamentalists found their small church schools closed because of tax<br/>\nlaws, that<br/>\n&gt; the idea of school-at-home became popular, and hence the distinction<br/>\nbetween the<br/>\n&gt; two terms.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But actually, these days, for people seriously into unschooling, I&#39;d<br/>\nrecommend<br/>\n&gt; several books which are not about homeschooling at all, but about the<br/>\nlearning<br/>\n&gt; process and children&#39;s potential.  The two which immediately come to mind<br/>\nare<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Flow&quot; by Mihaly Czikschentmihaly (I think I spelled that correctly), and<br/>\nJoseph<br/>\n&gt; Chilton Pearce&#39;s &quot;Magical Child&quot;.  By definition (at least I think),<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; DOESN&#39;T HAVE nuts and bolts -- it is an approach to thinking about<br/>\nchildren, their<br/>\n&gt; way of being, and their learning capabilities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; FINALLY, I would love to know how unschoolers feel about following a<br/>\nloose<br/>\n&gt; &gt; curriculum for math and reading, but unschooling for &quot;everything else.&quot;<br/>\nIf<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a<br/>\ngood one?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My older one is almost totally self-directed -- we help her think about<br/>\nhow, over<br/>\n&gt; a period of months or years she can get herself where her learning desires<br/>\nimpel<br/>\n&gt; her -- and contract with her to try various approaches (and for us to<br/>\nprovide<br/>\n&gt; various supports in the process.)  My younger one is a self-directed and<br/>\nvery<br/>\n&gt; talented gymnast and musician (a phenomenal pianist and flutist) -- we<br/>\ndon&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to do anything in those areas.  We do ask her to do about an hour or so a<br/>\nday of<br/>\n&gt; the usual reading, writing, arithmetic stuff -- frankly, I think it is<br/>\nmore for<br/>\n&gt; our benefit (my wife and I haven&#39;t finished deschooling) -- she reads,<br/>\nwrites, and<br/>\n&gt; does arithmetic perfectly well for a nine-year-old, I guess (whatever that<br/>\nmeans),<br/>\n&gt; and whether requiring her to do this hour a day has any impact on her<br/>\nfuture<br/>\n&gt; capabilities, I don&#39;t know (but I have grave doubts.)  She has already<br/>\nproven she<br/>\n&gt; knows how to learn when she wants to do so, so what&#39;s the point?  The<br/>\nSudbury<br/>\n&gt; Valley Schools have proven, over a 30-year period and with hundreds of<br/>\nkids, that<br/>\n&gt; the total sum of mathematics learning in the usual k-12 school can be<br/>\ntaught, all<br/>\n&gt; of it, in 8 weeks, when the child is ready and contracts to do so.

I would also like to know which of these is more useful --<br/>\n&gt; &quot;The Homeschooling Handbook&quot; or &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dear Susan --<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome!!!  I&#39;d recommend &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; more for &quot;handholding<br/>\npurposes than anything else.  I&#39;d recommend Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking<br/>\nChildren&#39;s Choices Seriously&quot; and my own (below) if you want a chronicle of how<br/>\nunschooling approaches can work (with lots of examples), as well as John Holt&#39;s<br/>\nbooks (Holt, by the way, used the terms &quot;homeschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\ninterchangeably -- it was only later, in the 1980s when large numbers of<br/>\nfundamentalists found their small church schools closed because of tax laws, that<br/>\nthe idea of school-at-home became popular, and hence the distinction between the<br/>\ntwo terms.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut actually, these days, for people seriously into unschooling, I&#39;d recommend<br/>\nseveral books which are not about homeschooling at all, but about the learning<br/>\nprocess and children&#39;s potential.  The two which immediately come to mind are<br/>\n&quot;Flow&quot; by Mihaly Czikschentmihaly (I think I spelled that correctly), and Joseph<br/>\nChilton Pearce&#39;s &quot;Magical Child&quot;.  By definition (at least I think), unschooling<br/>\nDOESN&#39;T HAVE nuts and bolts -- it is an approach to thinking about children, their<br/>\nway of being, and their learning capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; FINALLY, I would love to know how unschoolers feel about following a loose<br/>\n&gt; curriculum for math and reading, but unschooling for &quot;everything else.&quot;  If<br/>\n&gt; the child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a good one?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My older one is almost totally self-directed -- we help her think about how, over<br/>\na period of months or years she can get herself where her learning desires impel<br/>\nher -- and contract with her to try various approaches (and for us to provide<br/>\nvarious supports in the process.)  My younger one is a self-directed and very<br/>\ntalented gymnast and musician (a phenomenal pianist and flutist) -- we don&#39;t have<br/>\nto do anything in those areas.  We do ask her to do about an hour or so a day of<br/>\nthe usual reading, writing, arithmetic stuff -- frankly, I think it is more for<br/>\nour benefit (my wife and I haven&#39;t finished deschooling) -- she reads, writes, and<br/>\ndoes arithmetic perfectly well for a nine-year-old, I guess (whatever that means),<br/>\nand whether requiring her to do this hour a day has any impact on her future<br/>\ncapabilities, I don&#39;t know (but I have grave doubts.)  She has already proven she<br/>\nknows how to learn when she wants to do so, so what&#39;s the point?  The Sudbury<br/>\nValley Schools have proven, over a 30-year period and with hundreds of kids, that<br/>\nthe total sum of mathematics learning in the usual k-12 school can be taught, all<br/>\nof it, in 8 weeks, when the child is ready and contracts to do so.  The evidence<br/>\nis there, we just have to become more comfortable working with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the list!<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n&quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot; is to homeschooling what Tom Paine&#39;s &quot;Common<br/>\nSense&quot; was to the American Revolution.&quot;--Greg Bates, Common Courage Press.
