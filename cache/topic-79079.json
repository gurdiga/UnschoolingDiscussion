I had stopped in front of my <br/>\nhouse to see if the power had come on during the ice storm here in Maine. The car <br/>\nof teenagers came up behind me and laid on its horn and yelled something at <br/>\nme. I drove down the road behind them to ask what the problem was and the kid <br/>\nstopped his car got out and opened the trunk. I didn&#39;t stay to find out what he <br/>\npulled out. <br/>\nAnother time some kids went by our home at like 90 mph, I called the police <br/>\nand I went to find them. A local officer flagged me down and said not a good <br/>\nidea. That if I went to their door they could shoot me for trespassing. Ugh, <br/>\nnice.. Good ol&#39; Maine. This was the same kids that drove by me retrieving my <br/>\nloose dog and their mirror brushed my shirt as they flew by.  The speed on our <br/>\nstreet is 35 but not many follow it.
