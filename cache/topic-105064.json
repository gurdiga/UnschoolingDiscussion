He was born that way, needing little sleep, not <br/>\nnapping, and now for the past two years staying up all night most nights. <br/>\nIn that time he has taught himself (with the help of on-line friends) 2-3 <br/>\ncomputer languages and is learning more, writes game reviews, is creating a <br/>\ncomputer game, is webmaster of a site (off and on - I&#39;m not sure right now), <br/>\nand plays games on-line or alone.   He reads, enjoys sci-fi and anime, <br/>\nwatches TV and movies, builds with legos, and enjoys arranging his star wars <br/>\ncollection.  He also is into theater and works on his lines at night alone <br/>\nor with his 12 yo brother (it&#39;s no longer cool for mom to help much).  If <br/>\nJohn has something going on early in the day, he&#39;ll (try to) go to sleep <br/>\nearly the night before (early being between midnight and 2).<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think he&#39;s blossoming with unschooling (as we are Roses, I <br/>\nthink all my children blossom&lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with others who say please let your daughter do what is natural for <br/>\nher.  Just because the world says that children should live on a school&#39;s <br/>\ntimetable, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right or good for every child.   Ben Franklin <br/>\nmay have ben right about some things, but I don&#39;t believe that &quot;early to bed <br/>\nand early to rise make[ a person] healthy, wealthy and wise!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - It sounds like you&#39;re doing great for just starting out!  Best wishes <br/>\nas you continue.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105069,"nextTopicId":105073}}
