I read her post in the <br/>\nfigurative sense.  That there are days when the *thought* of throwing the <br/>\ntowel in comes to mind.  I saw nothing to suggest she was actually making <br/>\nthat a serious consideration.  I read a post by a mother needing <br/>\nreassurance, a friendly smile and a nudge back in the right direction.  What <br/>\nI don&#39;t understand about your reply is why you want to do better. (?)  What <br/>\ndid you handle incorrectly that you might like to change?  Did you handle <br/>\nthem all with patience and understanding?  If so, where is the need for <br/>\nimprovement in your reactions??<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, but I have a hard time believing that you have never once felt a <br/>\nlack of patience as a mother.  I could see having a lack of patience but <br/>\nstill being understanding and gentle in your approach.  To put the word job <br/>\nin stars seemed snarky to me.  I don&#39;t see how a *job* is a bad thing!  <br/>\nWeren&#39;t you the one who spoke of listing mother on a form of some sort in <br/>\nthe *job* blank?  Either that or you were the one who shared the essay it <br/>\nstemmed from.

But you left it at, <br/>\nno, I never feel that way about my *job*.  How was that in any way helpful <br/>\nand did you honestly think your response was helpful to her in *any* way?  <br/>\nOr was it an attempt to come here and tout your perfect righteousness and <br/>\npossibly make someone feel like shit?<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m confused by this. The people that commented on this gave a resounding<br/>\nyes answer. My first thought at reading it was definitely no.<br/>\nWhat &quot;job&quot; are speaking of? Being a mom or being a mom to unschooled kids?<br/>\nWell either way, the wording of &quot;feel like I don&#39;t have enough patience&quot;<br/>\nmakes me feel like someone just wanted to call it a day and not go on<br/>\nanymore. (with the job) I have never felt like that. I haven&#39;t felt like I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have &quot;enough&quot; patience. What I do feel at times is that I want and<br/>\nneed to be better at what I do. No, actually I always feel like I want to do<br/>\nbetter.

It<br/>\nhelps me to remember that even if I plan things well and try to account for<br/>\nkids who are tired and hungry and bring along fun things for them to do,<br/>\nsometimes for whatever reason, my kid or kids are just going to have a tough<br/>\ntime of things. Heck, sometimes even though my life is pretty darn good, *I*<br/>\nhave a tough time and do stupid things like pick a fight with my husband<br/>\nover something silly. It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t love him, it means I was<br/>\nhaving  a hard day and didn&#39;t process is well. Same thing with my kids, and<br/>\nI try to use forgiveness, both in their direction and in my own.<br/>\nPatience is a tough one. I wasn&#39;t known as a patient person before having<br/>\nkids, and it&#39;s been a work in progress over the years for me (I have a 6.and<br/>\na 3 year old). Right now when they&#39;re both fairly young and the littlest one<br/>\nis still in that phase where things like &quot;I want yogurt to eat, no a<br/>\nsandwich, no YOGURT, I said YOGURT!! No, I want to get MY OWN SPOON!!!!&quot; are<br/>\na minute-by-minute experience, my patience gets taken down to it&#39;s very end<br/>\nat times. I&#39;m learning as we go to breathe deeply and let go, but there are<br/>\ntimes when it all just mounts up. Of course, trying to get something done<br/>\nlike grocery shopping can really be a challenge.<br/>\nHang in there, none of us is perfect. We are all on the road to being more<br/>\npatient, more trusting, more of the parents we want to be.<br/>\nOne thing that sometimes works for me when we go shopping is to have the<br/>\nkids each bring along one thing, something small they can hold on to. I went<br/>\nshopping with my 6 year old last night and he brought along one of his Lego<br/>\npeople, &quot;Cam&quot;. Well, the whole way through the store, Cam told me stories of<br/>\nher adventures-- the time she fought the giant transforming Allosaurus, the<br/>\ntime she teamed up with the Bionicles to defeat the evil Makuta, the time<br/>\nshe and her partner (named &quot;Water&quot;) built a trap for the Skeletors, etc. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think my son took a breath for the hour we were in the store. After<br/>\nawhile, I looked up and realized that the people around us were smiling at<br/>\nus, just to hear his enthusiasm and the stories he was telling, the detail,<br/>\nhow excited he was. It felt really good to just be there with my amazing,<br/>\ninventive kid and have him bringing smiles not only to me, but to everyone<br/>\naround us. To him, it was not another drudgery of a shopping trip, but an<br/>\nhour where he got to talk to me for the whole time. He loved it! And I loved<br/>\nthe little things he did like asking the checkout lady for some stickers for<br/>\nhis little sister. Very thoughtful. So just that one act of suggesting he<br/>\nbring a Lego person along transformed a trip from possibly dreadful to<br/>\nmagical.<br/>\nOf course, some days nothing works, everything falls apart, the center<br/>\ncannot hold, etc. and then we just have to practice forgiveness--to our<br/>\nkids, to ourselves--and move on, hopefully learning something for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147747865,"authorName":"rwdhmc","from":"&quot;rwdhmc&quot; &lt;phdrwd@...&gt;","profile":"phdyer2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: One Lurker Says Hi","postDate":"1053353856","msgId":69897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWMzMWUxMSQ2NWQ4ZjMyMCQ2NDFiOGMxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjhncUNVMFlKTGQ5cE8wMDAzM2EyMkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69894,"nextInTopic":69903,"prevInTime":69896,"nextInTime":69898,"topicId":69842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Jennifer for that beautiful post.

I had just mopped the kitchen <br/>\n </span></blockquote>floor.  I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; just wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him off <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he fell <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; asleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sleeping <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; little angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>peace <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; washed over me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our sheets still haven&#39;t made it into the washer.  The house is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>still a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mess.  But my kids are all sleeping peacefully.

There are no alarm clocks set, no homework due.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>When the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kids wake up their Daddy will be home and they will scream with joy <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to see <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him again.  And they will have all day to be with him and catch up <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; latest lost tooth, the birthday party he missed and tell him all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the new <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; words they learned to spell.

Though my faults lie more with slothfulness. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps to not look at unschooling as the ideal we should be but as<br/>\nthe goal we should keep focused on. Rather than looking at a mistake and<br/>\nbeating ourselves up for what we should have done, we can look at it and<br/>\nfigure out how we could handle it better next time. It also helps to look at<br/>\nthe bigger picture. Rather than focusing on the scene and what you could<br/>\nhave done with the melt down, look at what you could have done to prevent<br/>\nthe melt down. Like maybe taking snacks with you, or give yourself<br/>\npermission to stop and take a mall food break, or do smaller shopping trips,<br/>\nor only shop when she can stay with someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to look at things through your children&#39;s eyes.

And maybe he&#39;ll leave early if you<br/>\nburst into tears. But maybe he&#39;ll just get angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened.

This could not have come at a better time.  We are down to <br/>\nthe wire in finding a house.  The fridge AND the ac went out this week.  My <br/>\nchildren learned how to unlock the front door and I don&#39;t have a way to get <br/>\nto the store to get a Houdini-proof lock.  Yesterday, the kids and I walked <br/>\nto McDonalds for a cool indoor break and a *cold* drink.  My dear sweet <br/>\nEthan decided to strip naked, including his dirty diaper, in the play-gym <br/>\nand appeared from the slide in his birthday suit in front of about 20 <br/>\npeople.  I&#39;m trying to pack, find a house, give my husband directions in <br/>\nColumbia, SC while being in Texas and not seeing all the streets he&#39;s seeing <br/>\non the map so feeling hopelessly lost even though I&#39;m the one at home, <br/>\nreading the dang map!  I hate being hot.  Hot makes me incredibly cranky.  <br/>\nChloe has been screaming all day and the carpet in THREE rooms is soaking <br/>\nwet because the ac flooded.  My husband will be home in three hours and the <br/>\nhouse is a wreck.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it isn&#39;t obvious, I&#39;m feeling quite sorry for myself.   &lt;pitiful grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, it&#39;s Sunday.   Nicholette got a phonics turbo blaster for her birthday <br/>\nand she has been spelling words for me all day.  Lauren learned how to spell <br/>\nON and OFF and wrote it on a piece of paper, along with her name and a <br/>\nbeautiful picture and presented it to me as a gift.  I found myself thinking <br/>\nhow wonderful it is that we are unschoolers.  We had Nic&#39;s birthday party <br/>\ntoday and my cousin was griping because tomorrow is a school day.  She&#39;s <br/>\nbeen at camp all weekend and feels too tired to go back to school in the <br/>\nmorning.  She didn&#39;t feel like going home and reading for homework.  My kids <br/>\nwere doing it for fun!  For the excitement and joy of learning!  How blessed <br/>\nwe truly are!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile cleaning out the laundry room cabinets (the equivilant of most <br/>\npeoples&#39; &#39;junk drawers&#39; only 80 times as big) I found newborn pictures of <br/>\nChloe and the cutest picture of all the kids on hands and knees crawling <br/>\naway from the camera in a long side-by-side line.  I hung my gift from <br/>\nLaurie on the fridge to help me smile while going about my dreary business <br/>\nat hand.  Instead of packing away the pictures of Chloe and the kids, I <br/>\ngrabbed a coke and took a break to remember the joy and peace of her birth <br/>\nand what a fun day we had that day.  When I came in the house, Ethan was <br/>\nsitting in the kitchen floor with empty cupcake papers and the salt and <br/>\npepper, making &#39;birthday cakes&#39;.  I had just mopped the kitchen floor.  I <br/>\njust wanted to scream and cry.  Instead, I grabbed him and carried him off <br/>\nto bed.  I sang him a soft song and rubbed his beautiful face until he fell <br/>\nasleep.  For an hour, I went from room to room, carressing my sleeping <br/>\nlittle angels.  Little by little my patience returned.  A wave of peace <br/>\nwashed over me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur sheets still haven&#39;t made it into the washer.  The house is still a <br/>\nmess.  But my kids are all sleeping peacefully.  I have a beautful picture <br/>\nhanging on my fridge that no professional artist nor writer could ever <br/>\ncompare with.   There are no alarm clocks set, no homework due.  When the <br/>\nkids wake up their Daddy will be home and they will scream with joy to see <br/>\nhim again.  And they will have all day to be with him and catch up on the <br/>\nlatest lost tooth, the birthday party he missed and tell him all the new <br/>\nwords they learned to spell.  He&#39;ll get to hear Chloe say Dada for the first <br/>\ntime with his own ears as the girls all sit around praising her as if she <br/>\nwere the smartest baby ever born.  He&#39;ll be gone again before week&#39;s end so <br/>\nwe have precious little time to savor with him.  I am thankful they are <br/>\nhome, were they belong, for if they were in school, they would miss these <br/>\nbeautiful moments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can only say, look for every shining light in every day.  If there were no <br/>\nsour, trying moments, what need would we have for patience?   Through trial <br/>\nand error, we become better parents.  Better people.  If we can see the <br/>\nlight in the face of darkness we become more loving, patient and giving <br/>\nindividuals.   This job we women hold as mothers (among so many others) <br/>\nmakes us better people.  We are changing the world, not just for our <br/>\nchildren but by them and through them.  Every life they touch is a <br/>\nreflection of our own.    We are held accountable for every mistake we make <br/>\nand thanked for far less than we deserve.  It IS the hardest job a woman <br/>\ncould ever have.   It is also the most rewarding.  If we can stop and find <br/>\neven the smallest particle of hope, the slightest little reward, we somehow <br/>\nfind the patience to move on and in the process, we find new solutions, <br/>\nbetter choices, and create happier lives.  We learn that our job pays better <br/>\nthan any check ever written.  We are paid in love, smiles, hugs and kisses, <br/>\nand bright little eyes that sparkle with each new discovery.  But perhaps <br/>\neven more valueable, our children look into *our* eyes for comfort and find <br/>\npeace after a skinned toe, a broken toy or a love-torn heart.  It is a hard <br/>\njob, but it is priceless.  Sometimes, we just need to reach out for a little <br/>\nreminder. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could offer you a cup overflowing with patience, but I haven&#39;t <br/>\nfound a vendor! LOL  Just breath, take that moment to find your shining <br/>\nlight and your cup will overflow!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHelp STOP SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: One Lurker Says Hi","postDate":"1053320862","msgId":69864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhOW9xdStpY3VtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGUwMWMzMWRiOCRmZjRmNDk0MCQzYWU0NGI0M0BIZWR3aWc+"},"prevInTopic":69863,"nextInTopic":69871,"prevInTime":69863,"nextInTime":69865,"topicId":69842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... this job?
