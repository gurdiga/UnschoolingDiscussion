You&#39;ll also<br/>\nneed whole cloves of garlic and a big old head of dill (not baby dill,<br/>\nbut get it before it&#39;s totally seed). Pack your very clean mason jars<br/>\nwith scrubbed small cukes, put in your garlic (there&#39;s no such thing as<br/>\ntoo much), add the dill and top up with the brine.(Water and salt<br/>\nbrought to a boil, then cooled slightly.  You might have to go by taste<br/>\nhere; the water should taste like salty sea water)  Seal with rubber<br/>\nseals and leave to rest at least a couple of weeks.  A couple months is<br/>\nusually better.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Strawberries need to be sort of sliced depending on how plump they are.  If<br/>\n&gt; you slice them too thin they turn into hard little waffers.  We buy<br/>\n&gt; seedless watermelons and a really delicious seedless yellow watermelon.<br/>\n&gt; You slice it about an 1/8th to a 1/4 inch thick.  We have two dehydraters,<br/>\n&gt; one of those round things and a combo convection oven/dehydrator.  Just lay<br/>\n&gt; them on the trays and check them after a few hours and flip them over once.<br/>\n&gt;  We also do bananas but you need to dip them in lemon juice so they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; turn brown (commercial banana chips are treated with sulfur and lord knows<br/>\n&gt; what else).  The big kidlet&#39;s favorite (hubby &lt;g&gt;) is pears and we also do<br/>\n&gt; apples.  We are going to try some other types of fruit this year and also<br/>\n&gt; fruit leathers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do onions and peppers and put them in old mayo and pickle jars and then<br/>\n&gt; just grab a handful to toss in soups and stews during the off season.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, in a sneaky way to get hubby more involved, I bought &quot;him&quot; a smoker<br/>\n&gt; for Christmas.  We are going to smoke salmon (his BIG favorite) when they<br/>\n&gt; are running this year.  I also bought &quot;him&quot; a copy of Back to Basics which<br/>\n&gt; has home smoking recipes in it for bacon and ham, etc.  &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are going to try making our own pickles this year.
