One<br/>\nthing that i&#39;ve noticed above anything else is that my 4-year old son, who<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been a napper since he was 2, is now taking at least one nap a day,<br/>\nor is going in his room for quiet time at least once a day. I know this is<br/>\nnot a coincidence because the same thing happened in January when we put a<br/>\nmoratoreum on TV viewing. It should be noted that we are not dawn til dusk<br/>\nTV viewers, either...in a typical day we watch maybe an hour of PBS and<br/>\nmaybe one or two videos...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s great that he&#39;s giving himself down time! And I wonder what TV<br/>\ndoes to him that causes him to not need or not want to take this time. I did<br/>\nread Jerry Manders&#39; book (4 Arguments for the Elimination of Television) and<br/>\nthere was a whole section about TV and hyperactivity. It&#39;s pretty intriguing<br/>\nto me that the lack of television affects my son this way. Has anyone else<br/>\nnoticed this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for our tv, well, I&#39;d really like to just put it up in the closet, but I<br/>\nstill rely on videos to do my yoga, and rainy days can really be difficult<br/>\nwithout the &quot;down time&quot;. However, I think I&#39;m going to actually start<br/>\nregulating since it does seem to have a physiological effect on my son!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW - I&#39;m Lainie...I&#39;m an avid lurker and a breastfeeding, cloth-diapering,<br/>\nno-meat eating, semi-single (long story!) mama to Monk (age 4 - who claims<br/>\nI&#39;m a &quot;poser vegetarian&quot; since I started eating eggs and cheese again, and<br/>\nthis afternoon asked if he could have some &quot;soy broccoli&quot;) and Cole (age 6<br/>\nmonths - who really enjoys having his tummy &quot;zerbetted&quot; more than anything<br/>\nelse in the world.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20029,"nextTopicId":20039}}
