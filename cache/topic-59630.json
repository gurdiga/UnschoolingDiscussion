So, those books have sat on Jaidens shelf, he&#39;s fliped through them a few times and done a couple pages with his uncle (whose 9) when they play school. But he&#39;s been in no rush to learn to write. The other day we where walking home from the zoo and JAiden started adding and subtracting ones from all the address signs he saw, hell I didn&#39;t even know he &quot;knew&quot; the numbers yet, he had so much fun with it. Yesterday he was drawing superhero pictures and telling me the story as he was drawing, when he was done he showed it to me, it wes covered in letters. He had decided to write the story down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t make him do those workbooks. He enjoyed himself so much by doing it his own way, in his own time.

They are really completely failing in that area - by <br/>\ntheir own standards, much less by the standards that we unschoolers <br/>\nwould impose (kids learning for the love of it, gaining deep <br/>\nunderstanding of concepts that interest them, joyfully gaining <br/>\ncompetencies and finding personal satisfaction in achieving a greater <br/>\nunderstanding of how the world works, building tools to use in pursuing <br/>\ntheir passionate interests, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry about math among unschoolers only because the parents have <br/>\nalmost all been &quot;schooled&quot; and therefore so often have some pretty <br/>\nmajor negative math issues. If parents have anxiety or phobias about <br/>\nmath - resulting in negative attitudes, avoidance, etc., then I really <br/>\nthink that a bit of very conscious thinking about unschooling and math <br/>\nis in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents are SO helpful to their kids, so supportive, so &quot;in <br/>\ntune&quot; with their possible interests and needs -- and the parents <br/>\nthemselves are interesting and interested in so many things  -- that is <br/>\nwhat really makes unschooling so great. But, if a parent has a mental <br/>\nblock in one area - if a parent has spent years building up their OWN <br/>\navoidance mechanisms - if a parent feels anxious or negative about <br/>\nsomething - I think the parents need to make a conscious and specific <br/>\neffort to get over it and to be the great <br/>\nfacilitators/supporters/encouragers that they are in other areas, <br/>\nespecially in mathematics, because it is SO everywhere and so likely <br/>\nthat their kids will be interested in something that involves math.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is everywhere. It isn&#39;t necessary to separate math and &quot;unschool <br/>\neverything but math.&quot;  But if parents are uncomfortable with it, then <br/>\nthey might not &quot;engage&quot; their kids like they do with other things. And, <br/>\nthey might have spent so many years getting comfortable with their own <br/>\ndesire to avoid it, that they might automatically be avoiding it and, <br/>\nfor unschooling parents, that can mean that they are NOT noticing a <br/>\nkids&#39; developing interest - not noticing those moments when some <br/>\ninteresting math could be examined and NOT noticing the math learning <br/>\nthat is going on and that they could support.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is NOT important for kids to learn school type math. It does seem <br/>\nimportant, to me, for kids to be, as they follow their interests with <br/>\nthe support and attention and encouragement and input of their loving <br/>\nparents, gaining an underlying understanding of a variety of really <br/>\nimportant mathematical concepts. This will happen automatically, just <br/>\nlike other learning, in a stimulating, learning-supporting, <br/>\ncuriosity-encouraged thinking, examining, investigating, wondering <br/>\nunschooling home. But, it won&#39;t necessarily happen if parents <br/>\nthemselves are math anxious and do nothing about it to help themselves <br/>\nget over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of parents know this, intuitively, and, not knowing what else to <br/>\ndo about it - wanting to make sure their kids &quot;get math,&quot; they <br/>\n&quot;unschool everything but math.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly that just means they end up passing along their own math anxiety <br/>\nto their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe underlying concepts that are important - and the few math skills <br/>\nthat are important - CAN be picked up (WILL be picked up) in a <br/>\nmath-healthy unschooling family. But I just have my doubts that there <br/>\nare that many parents out there who are all that math-healthy unless <br/>\nthey put some specific directed effort into overcoming their schooling <br/>\nand all its negative consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I don&#39;t mean parents have to get over it themselves so much as they <br/>\nhave to be aware of it and consciously not pass it on to their kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thursday, February 27, 2003, at 09:14 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve been trying to NOT worry about this, but must admit on some <br/>\n&gt; levels it is<br/>\n&gt; terrifying to think about my children not being exposed to enough math <br/>\n&gt; before<br/>\n&gt; they head off to college.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any experience with this they can share?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I completely understand the concept of only learning math that you <br/>\n&gt; need in<br/>\n&gt; real life, I so agree with that, having struggled to excel with <br/>\n&gt; formulas and<br/>\n&gt; such that I rarely have used in the &quot;real world&quot;.

They can watch tv all day if they want to, sometimes they do, but thats usually when kids that cant watch at home come over and make a huge deal over the fact that the tv is on in the kids room and they have control over it (the only thing we ask is that they keep the volume to a reasonable level, our neighbors just had a baby and they share a bedroom wall with the kids).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do get tired of defending or tv viewing decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nps.

I think that you have to have lots of things avalible to them so that they can discover and learn in their own way. I think it means more to them when it&#39;s their idea, their creation, their whatever...you know just theirs instead of something that a parent has handed them. And I think that no matter how much you pad it in &#39;unschooloing lingo&#39; if the parent is handing it to the child, it&#39;s the parents, not the childs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make sense?

There <br/>\nare many ways to implement math without the typical worksheets, which <br/>\nprovide no real life application. You can cook and increase or decrease a <br/>\nrecipe by a fraction, doubling, etc. You can take a shopping trip looking at <br/>\nitems of interest to your son and let him determine what the discount would <br/>\nbe. At the grocery store, he can make an estimate of his favorite fruits and <br/>\nvegetables that you purchase and then weigh them checking his estimate. He <br/>\ncould set up a budget by researching some of the careers he is interested in <br/>\nand working off of a budget from what he would earn. He would also be able <br/>\nto research the educational requirements for the job that he desires. He can <br/>\ncontinue by searching for a house that would be within his budget. He could <br/>\nplay a stock market simulation-there are books out there or several Internet <br/>\nsites that would be of assistance. It is just an unending journey of fun! He <br/>\ncould even use athletics when learning geometrical concepts.  There are many <br/>\ngames that provide ways to increase logic skills and higher order thinking <br/>\nskills, such as, Othello, SET (a card game), mancala, and much more. I hope <br/>\nthis helps and as far as unschooling, I am not sure if this qualifies-I know <br/>\ntoo little about the topic.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell all this stuff is wonderful if the child is really interested in doing <br/>\neverything you gave examples for.

There are <br/>\nmany ways to implement math without the typical worksheets, which provide no <br/>\nreal life application.  You can cook and increase or decrease a recipe by a <br/>\nfraction, doubling, etc.  You can take a shopping trip looking at items of <br/>\ninterest to your son and let him determine what the discount would be.  At <br/>\nthe grocery store, he can make an estimate of his favorite fruits and <br/>\nvegetables that you purchase and then weigh them checking his estimate.  He <br/>\ncould set up a budget by researching some of the careers he is interested in <br/>\nand working off of a budget from what he would earn.  He would also be able <br/>\nto research the educational requirements for the job that he desires.  He can <br/>\ncontinue by searching for a house that would be within his budget.  He could <br/>\nplay a stock market simulation-there are books out there or several Internet <br/>\nsites that would be of assistance.  It is just an unending journey of fun!  <br/>\nHe could even use athletics when learning geometrical concepts.  There are <br/>\nmany games that provide ways to increase logic skills and higher order <br/>\nthinking skills, such as, Othello, SET (a card game), mancala, and much more. <br/>\n I hope this helps and as far as unschooling, I am not sure if this <br/>\nqualifies-I know too little about the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come to realize that my daughter has worked hard her whole life, <br/>\nstruggled in school, and has had her talents stifled!  She is an avid <br/>\nreader-up to 8 hours at a crack, writes her own chapter books, but is <br/>\nreceiving a D in English!  It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  I am doing research <br/>\nregarding the unschooling and hope to have a program in place for next year.  <br/>\nI am a single parent raising 3 children, working full time and am trying to <br/>\ndetermine how to do this to make this successful and give my daughter the <br/>\nopportunity to feel success!  She is truly talented, but I feel that she is <br/>\nbeing held back from reaching success.  My daughter is just about 14.  Any <br/>\nsuggestions?  I would love to hear them!  I am from the Tacoma area and if <br/>\nthere are any groups that meet (at night) I would love to experience it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best to your son!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn Schoenenberger</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Introduction and question","postDate":"1046231032","msgId":59636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzAyMjUxOTQzMjEuMDFjMTMxYTBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOWQwMWMyZGQ0ZSQ5NzI1ODAwMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzAyMjUxODQ3MTEuMDFiZmQ3ZjBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":59634,"nextInTopic":59641,"prevInTime":59635,"nextInTime":59637,"topicId":59630,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Excellent distinction.

Please.  I want to encourage you, but I really feel the need to <br/>\npoint some stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;book worm.  I taught her how to read using the Spalding phonograms<br/>\n&gt;and she took off and never looked back.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to mess with your linguistics a little because they really do <br/>\naffect how you think, and ask, did you really *teach* her to read, or was <br/>\nshe just ready to learn it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She has been a breeze to<br/>\n&gt;homeschool.  The only rule I have had is that for every fictional<br/>\n&gt;book that she checked out from the library she had to check out 3 non-<br/>\n&gt;fiction and a biography.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, what a bummer.  I&#39;d hate it if someone tried to tell me I had to have <br/>\na ratio for the kind of books I was &#39;allowed&#39; to check out.  Why do you <br/>\nwant to make this rule for her?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My son, on the other hand, struggled to<br/>\n&gt;learn how to read.  He hit the magical &quot;time to learn how to read<br/>\n&gt;age&quot; and so off we went....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How did he show you that it was the &#39;magical time to learn how to read <br/>\nage&#39;?  Is there only one of those ages?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;right into a brick wall.  By the time he<br/>\n&gt;would put one phonogram together he had forgotten what the previous<br/>\n&gt;one was.  So, we quit.  He didn&#39;t read his first real &quot;book&quot; until<br/>\n&gt;about 1 1/2 years ago.  He started with the Lord of the Rings<br/>\n&gt;trilogy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s quite a &#39;book&#39; to start with.  My 13 year old likes Garfield <br/>\ncomics.  My 16 year old likes teen-confession and poetry books.  We listen <br/>\nto Lord of the Rings on CD during long car trips.  Even *I* don&#39;t like to <br/>\nread LoR in paper.  Snooooooooze.  Good for him for liking it so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou still read out loud to him, right?  To all your kids, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He loves reptiles and I have encouraged that (and the study<br/>\n&gt;of anything else he wanted).  It took me a long time to &quot;come out of<br/>\n&gt;the closet&quot;, the unschooling closet that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Might you still be working your way out of that durned closet, <br/>\nmaybe?  You&#39;re demanding your daughter read certain types of books and <br/>\n(later in the message) you can&#39;t seem to find the math in your life.  You <br/>\naren&#39;t trusting that your son will someday find it important to improve his <br/>\ngrammar/spelling.  It&#39;s great that you&#39;re started on the pathway to <br/>\nunschooling, and I want to encourage you to continue to plow on through <br/>\nuntil you reach it, but I&#39;m hoping you&#39;re open to seeing that, well, it&#39;s a <br/>\nwork in progress? (like many of us.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I struggled with<br/>\n&gt;feeling bound to all those books<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, some folks just aren&#39;t into bondage... Good for you for recognizing <br/>\nthat you&#39;re one of those folks!  (grin)  Hey, without a sense of humor, <br/>\nwe&#39;d all be fried by now, eh?<br/>\nHave you tried untying yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;, guilty that I couldn&#39;t accomplish<br/>\n&gt;it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, of course not!!  Their learning isn&#39;t up to you!  Their learning is <br/>\nup to THEM.  You&#39;re just there to throw interesting things in their <br/>\npathways, play taxi and talk with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All I wanted to do was hang out with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then do it.  Shut off the &quot;but, but, but, but...&quot; tape in your head and <br/>\nhang out with your kids!  Go to movies!  Go to the library and pick out <br/>\nWHATEVER they want!  Hang upside down from the monkey bars!  Eat Ice Cream <br/>\nwith Lots of Toppings!  Learn from them.  Fer&#39;gosh&#39;sake.  Follow your <br/>\ninstincts, not that &#39;we-should-be-learning-x-y-z&#39; rubbish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So, here comes my<br/>\n&gt;question.  Because my son hasn&#39;t been the reader that my daughter is<br/>\n&gt;he is sorely lacking in spelling and grammar skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know a child who *still* wasn&#39;t &#39;potty trained&#39; at 4 years old.  One day, <br/>\nit became important to him.  he worked at it and what do you know, within a <br/>\nday, he was fully potty &#39;trained&#39;.  No mistakes, no rushing here and there, <br/>\njust, done.  When your son thinks spelling is important, he&#39;ll start paying <br/>\nattention and spell correctly.  If I thought it was important for YOU to <br/>\nlearn Lithuanian, but you didn&#39;t think it was important, how much effort <br/>\nwould you put into learning Lithuanian?  Probably not a lot.  Until, of <br/>\ncourse, *you decided* you wanted to go to Lithuania.  See what I <br/>\nmean?  (note the emphasis on *you decided* as opposed to it being imposed <br/>\non you.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Trying to get<br/>\n&gt;Math done ( I can&#39;t figure out how to unschool that) is like pulling<br/>\n&gt;teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, once you get those teeth out, I&#39;m sure you could graph them according <br/>\nto the size of the attached root, whether they&#39;re incisors, molars... okay, <br/>\nokay. I&#39;m sorry, kinda, but not a whole lot.  It&#39;s one of my pet peeves.<br/>\nHow can you NOT see the math in everyday life?  Don&#39;t your kids have to buy <br/>\nthings?  Figure out how many of a something will fit into another <br/>\nsomething?  Cook?  Tally their money?  Know if they have enough money for a <br/>\nmovie AND popcorn?  Figure how many seconds you&#39;ve been on the phone while <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been waiting?  and what&#39;s that in nano-seconds?  There&#39;s math <br/>\nEVERYWHERE.  Maybe you could stop trying to figure out how to unschool it, <br/>\nand try to figure out how it&#39;s *already* being unschooled?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am beginning to feel like I am failing at homeschooling him<br/>\n&gt;and feel that I could use some advice and encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First of all, you&#39;ve taken a step in the right direction.  Second of all, <br/>\nyou&#39;re sending your kids mixed messages. You&#39;re not really <br/>\nunschooling.  Not really.  not yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read unschooling.com and sandradodd.com?  Go and read &#39;em.  Think <br/>\nof it as your homework (grin)  Lay off the kids completely for a while (as <br/>\nif they were &#39;decompressing&#39; from public school) do whatever it is they <br/>\nmight be interested in doing and (you) spend some time talking about this <br/>\nand that with folks on the unschooling boards and this list.  Don&#39;t try to <br/>\ndo ANYTHING schoolish, and that includes math or that library thing you <br/>\nmake your daughter do.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have read at least a thousand posts (maybe more) and have gotten <br/>\ncompletely mad at three different people over how we don&#39;t know what the <br/>\nheck we&#39;re talking about, then finish being mad &#39;cause you see what we <br/>\nmight have meant, THEN go back to the kids.  You&#39;ll probably still be <br/>\nsending them mixed messages, but maybe they&#39;ll be a little less mixed and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll feel a little less &#39;failured&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Well, sorry<br/>\n&gt;this was so long.....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I thought it was a really interesting post.
