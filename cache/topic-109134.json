We&#39;re staying with<br/>\nrelatives for at least a couple more months, so we have been trying to<br/>\nfit our stuff into two (quite small) bedrooms. Then to complicate<br/>\nmatters, when we had been here for three weeks, my mother-in-law had a<br/>\nstroke, and we all went to Bolivia for almost a month. <br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel (9) has been incredibly understanding, but its been really<br/>\nhard for him. We moved out of a housing situation in which he had two<br/>\nparks, a field, and about 12 friends literally out the back door.<br/>\nArlington is quite a culture shock, and he misses his friends, and we<br/>\ndon&#39;t get out nearly enough to expend some of that energy. We&#39;d gone<br/>\nto a couple park days of a local unschooling group, but then we missed<br/>\nfour or five, and when we went the other week, Gabriel was feeling<br/>\nvery shy (unusual for him), and just sat next to me, even though the<br/>\nother kids eventually came over and asked him to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been worrying (silently) about Gabriel&#39;s staying up so late. His<br/>\nmost recent schedule includes playing video games (Fantastic 4) or<br/>\nwatching tv (mostly cartoons) until like 3 or 4 in the morning, and<br/>\nsleeping until 2 in the afternoon. I will try to worry a little less,<br/>\nand see if it doesn&#39;t change once we actually start to settle in. For<br/>\nmy sake, I hope these late nights don&#39;t last, because I&#39;ll be working<br/>\na late shift starting next week, and if he gets up at 2pm, I&#39;ll only<br/>\nget to hang out with him for 2 hours, tops. I suppose I could be with<br/>\nhim when I get home, but I also have a 1-year-old, who&#39;s not gonna let<br/>\nme sleep late to make up for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nso glad to have this list,<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"diana jenner &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] de-moving","postDate":"1130537447","msgId":109137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNjJBMUU3LjgwNTA1MDlAc2lvLm1pZGNvLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDguNzNjYjg4ZjkuMzA5M2RiOTdAYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDguNzNjYjg4ZjkuMzA5M2RiOTdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":109136,"nextInTopic":109146,"prevInTime":109136,"nextInTime":109138,"topicId":109134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some of the weird clique-y things <br/>\nare not so cool (Are you playing with *her*? she&#39;s only 7!), but I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen really impressed with how Hannah, 9, is handling herself in the <br/>\npresence of a pretty strong, opinionated 10 year old (I&#39;ve known her <br/>\nmost of my life! she replied and returned to play).  She doesn&#39;t try to <br/>\ncompete with the stories of school and recess, she listens to her friend <br/>\nand they mostly do *girl* things, not *school* things. Sometimes I <br/>\nworry, but not in the end-of-the-world kind of way, but more like the &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t wanna deal with this&quot; kinda way; Hannah does complain when feeling <br/>\noverwhelmed and isn&#39;t afraid to call time out and demand space to <br/>\nherself or just us.  Hayden, 7, had struggled with the twin brother, <br/>\nmostly over the boy&#39;s obsession with playing Hayden&#39;s PS2.  I&#39;ve had <br/>\nsome talks with both boys, encouraging empathy and patience with one <br/>\nanother, but allowing Hayden to maintain control over something so <br/>\nprecious while his life was filled with Chaos.  It took about 6 weeks,  <br/>\njust last week Hayden approached him and offered Lego Star Wars.  <br/>\nHayden&#39;s made very clear boundaries and I&#39;ve no doubt they&#39;ll be <br/>\nhonored.  Things are being unpacked and finding homes, it doesn&#39;t feel <br/>\nso much like *someone else&#39;s house* anymore and that makes a huge <br/>\ndifference.  Though they spent many weeks having no opinion on what goes <br/>\nwhere and why, suddenly, they&#39;re suggesting furniture arrangements.  The <br/>\nkids spent lots of time sleeping, grazing, watching lots of TV -- just <br/>\nas you described, they&#39;re excited (the conference definitely helped!) <br/>\nand energized.  Tonight we&#39;re off to Hannah&#39;s concert with the Sioux <br/>\nFalls Girls Chorale (doesn&#39;t that sound fancy!), she&#39;s very excited!  <br/>\nThey both begin &#39;Y&#39; basketball on Saturday.   Our life isn&#39;t as much <br/>\n&quot;hanging out &#39;round the house&quot; as it was this summer, and it&#39;s a tough <br/>\nadjustment, but we&#39;re adapting and it&#39;s peaceful and fun :) <br/>\n<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] de-moving","postDate":"1130534000","msgId":109136,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNjI5NDcwLjcwOTA4MDhAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDguNzNjYjg4ZjkuMzA5M2RiOTdAYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDguNzNjYjg4ZjkuMzA5M2RiOTdAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":109135,"nextInTopic":109137,"prevInTime":109135,"nextInTime":109137,"topicId":109134,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** I think the TV watching helped him to handle the move away from his friends and cousins in Florida and he s now re-energized and feeling creative again.

He&#39;s happily gone <br/>\nwith us on some outings but often has just  wanted to stay home.  Mostly he&#39;s <br/>\nwatched things like Braniac and  Mythbusters but also gone back and played <br/>\nmany of his old PS2 and Gamecube  games. Many days he has just stayed in his <br/>\npajamas and watched TV all day  long.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis week I&#39;ve seen a complete change.  First, hours of just  staring into <br/>\nspace thinking and then nonstop talking about all the plans he  has for building <br/>\nthings.  All of a sudden he has all these plans to  build rockets and cars <br/>\nand robots. We were at Home Depot for over an hour last  night and he stood in <br/>\nthe PVC aisle the entire time thinking.  He was  so excited about all the <br/>\npossibilities.
