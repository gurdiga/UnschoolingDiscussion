I don&#39;t know exactly <br/>\nhow it works. . . I don&#39;t want to even try to explain it, because its been so <br/>\nlong since I even talked to her about it. But I know she got rid of all her <br/>\nallergies using this technique and even stopped wearing glasses as her <br/>\neyesight improved dramatically. She then began to use it in her profession <br/>\nand has helped lots of people. I have never had allergies, nor have my <br/>\nchildren so we never tried it. Her son had a fairly severe peanut allergy <br/>\nthat was gotten rid of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it involves going back in time in a meditative type thing and finding <br/>\na trigger point on your body that you can then use. . . but more than that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t really say. For instance, I know she had pretty bad allergy to cats. <br/>\nWhen the NLP was done, she found out how far back it went, and what the <br/>\ntrigger was that led to it, and healed herself of it. THey now have about 5 <br/>\ncats running around the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to post about it in case anyone is interested, they could <br/>\nprobably find a practioner in their area. . . I know there were several in <br/>\nLouisiana, so I suspect its pretty common. . . .I would guess massage <br/>\ntherapists would be a good place to start looking, or probalby the Net as <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27981,"nextTopicId":28002}}
