I <br/>\nknow in my life, when I&#39;m busy reading, writing, thinking, <br/>\nstudying, watching movies or TV, listening to books on tape, <br/>\ncooking, tending my African violets, going to plays, I&#39;m happier <br/>\nperson, and I am living the very kind of life I imagine they&#39;d enjoy <br/>\ntoo. And in our case, they really do seem to live this way naturally <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2304686,"authorName":"mc1mommy@aol.com","from":"mc1mommy@...","profile":"mc1mommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Introducing The Rall Family","postDate":"1062523412","msgId":79738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI4LjQ3MmZlNjQ2LjJjODYyYzE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":79742,"prevInTime":79737,"nextInTime":79739,"topicId":79738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe this is about <br/>\nyou being the BEST possible mother, by handing him that which you wanted most <br/>\nas a child.  And by him rejecting that, he&#39;s rejecting you. Maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think my son is suffering.  I have not forced him to do <br/>\nanything.  I haven&#39;t even ASKED him to do anything as far as school, <br/>\nor as far as the rest of his life, for that matter.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it seems obvious that you EXPECT something, or your posts wouldn&#39;t be so <br/>\nfull of hurt and resentment.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I would have loved it if somebody had offered me the <br/>\nchance to study any subject I&#39;d wanted&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill breathing?  Then it&#39;s not too late!  Go right ahead and study anything <br/>\nand everything you want.  If you have internet access, the world is at your <br/>\nfingertips.  I learn something new almost every day, by stumbling across <br/>\ninteresting pieces of information.  Right now, I&#39;m trying to learn the constellations <br/>\n(what they look like, and how to find them in the sky) and the stories of how <br/>\nthey got their names.  I came across a book store going out of business, and <br/>\ngot a book about astronomy, a couple about plants, one about architecture, one <br/>\nabout the history of art, one about Native Americans, and one about Ancient <br/>\nEgypt.  I&#39;m not &quot;studying&quot; these &quot;subjects&quot;, but I am learning.   Try to find a <br/>\nbalance between your &quot;responsibilities&quot; and what you need to make you happy.  <br/>\nI hope your day gets better.<br/>\nMary J<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79740,"nextTopicId":23378}}
