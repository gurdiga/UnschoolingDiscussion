BIGtime.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want someone to ask me whether I want to talk or think.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I get in the car, if the other person is talking, we talk.  If  the <br/>\nother person turns the radio on or asks for a tape or CD or whatever, we do  that. <br/>\n If osmoene says something while the music&#39;s on and it&#39;s short and  <br/>\nincidental to what we&#39;re seeing or it&#39;s quick, the music stays on.  If it&#39;s  something <br/>\nthat needs real conversation, I turn the music down or off.<br/>\n <br/>\nHaving to declare in advance whether one wants music, talk or quiet is  <br/>\nunnatural and seems more likely to cause stress than peace.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104398,"nextTopicId":104375}}
