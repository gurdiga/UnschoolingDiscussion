They&#39;re studying them in <br/>\ntheir absence (which is still too much, but better than they would have done <br/>\nthirty years ago, for SURE) knows about this other tribe and says they&#39;re wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tribe without many artifacts!

I&#39;m in total agreement with <br/>\nyou that learning is natural, and certainly communication is also a <br/>\nnatural human function. But while verbal communication is something <br/>\nthat humans are hard-wired to do, written communication in and of <br/>\nitself is not an equally inborn instinct--if it was, then all human <br/>\ncultures would write just as all human cultures speak, but they <br/>\ndon&#39;t, do they? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination of instinctually wanting to learn and wanting to <br/>\ncommunicate is what ultimately drives a human surrounded by writing <br/>\nto want to learn to read. But while WANTING to learn to read is <br/>\nindeed a natural inclination for these people, actually being ABLE to <br/>\ndo so is another matter. Not all brains are equally capable of <br/>\nachieving the same level of mastery of this particular skill. Some <br/>\npeople might call this a &quot;learning disability&quot;, others might just <br/>\nrealize that this is natural variation amongst human brains--the <br/>\npoint is that reading is a skill, something to be learned, not <br/>\nsomething that you&#39;re born knowing how to do.  And just as some <br/>\npeople have an easier time learning to draw, or play an instrument, <br/>\nor do algebra, so too do some people have an easier time learning to <br/>\nread. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo quote Dr. Lyon yet again:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We now have strong evidence that it is not the ear that understands <br/>\nthat a spoken word like &quot;cat&quot; is divided into three sounds and that <br/>\nthese discrete sounds can be linked to the letters C-A-T, it is the <br/>\nbrain that performs this function. In some youngsters, the brain <br/>\nseems to have an easy time processing this type of information. <br/>\nHowever, in many children, the skill is only learned with <br/>\ndifficulty....<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean that children who have a difficulty understanding that <br/>\nspoken words are composed of discrete individual sounds that can be <br/>\nlinked to letters suffer from brain dysfunction or damage? Not at <br/>\nall. It simply means that the neural systems that perceive the <br/>\nphonemes in our language are less efficient than in other children. <br/>\nThis difference in neural efficiency can also be hypothesized to <br/>\nunderlie the individual differences that we see every day in learning <br/>\nany skill such as singing, playing an instrument, constructing a <br/>\nhouse, painting a portrait, and the like. In some cases, our NICHD <br/>\nstudies have taught us that the phonological differences we see in <br/>\ngood and poor readers have a genetic basis....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, it&#39;s natural for an unschooled child who is surrounded by <br/>\nwritten material and supported by loving parents to want to learn to <br/>\nread, and to usually then indeed learn how to read to one degree or <br/>\nanother. But it&#39;s also natural for these children to learn to read at <br/>\ndifferent times, and different speeds, and ultimately at different <br/>\nlevels of skill and proficiency. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is natural, and communicating is natural, so for our <br/>\nchildren wanting to learn to read is natural. So, perhaps to some <br/>\ndegree then, you can say learning to read is a natural thing. But is <br/>\nlearning to read WELL natural? Just as not all children could learn <br/>\nto play a piano masterfully just by being sat in front of one and <br/>\nhaving recorded music played for them, not all children could learn <br/>\nto read proficiently simply by having books placed in front of them <br/>\nand being read to. Some kids can, but obviously not all can. <br/>\nSometimes a more proactive approach is required to learn these sorts <br/>\nof skills beyond a rudimentary level. Where the unschooling <br/>\nphilosophy comes in here is that the CHILD should be the one who asks <br/>\nfor this additional instruction, rather than the parent pushing the<br/>\ninstruction on the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, enough babbling from me for now, LOL...<br/>\nDeniz :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Re: late readers/was Pat Farenga","postDate":"1060808655","msgId":78739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwODEzLjE1MDQxNS4xNjg4LjMuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78736,"nextInTopic":78741,"prevInTime":78738,"nextInTime":78740,"topicId":78646,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Communication is natural.

I can&#39;t argue either side and really feel it was one or the other. I guess <br/>\nmaybe it is dependent on the person. How&#39;s that for evasive?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, much like the man in the post, my maternal grandfather could not <br/>\nread. Having left school at the age of 8 or 9, to bury his father and begin to <br/>\nwork to help feed his 11 siblings, he never read beyond a very minimal level. He <br/>\nalways had newpapers, but he was looking at the pictures not reading the news. <br/>\nWhen I would sit on his lap and ask him to read to me, he always said, &quot;No, <br/>\nyou read to me...show me how smart you are.&quot; I was probably about 8 or 9 when I <br/>\nrealized I was reading to him, because he couldn&#39;t read to me. I cried. I <br/>\nthought it was horrible and unfair that no one had taught him how. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand how he got through life without it. He never learned. It became <br/>\nunimportant to him, because he was able to work around it. I never told him I knew he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t read. He was a strong and proud Irishman, who I know found shame in <br/>\nhis illiteracy. But by the same token, he was too proud to try and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the natural position, well I can say I really honestly don&#39;t remember <br/>\nnot being able to read. But even my parents say no one ever taught me. It was <br/>\njust something I could do. So perhaps for me it was natural. I read long <br/>\nbefore I ever went to school. So I wasn&#39;t taught by the system. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I have no answer to whether it is or isn&#39;t natural to learn to read, I <br/>\nwonder why the process has to be one or the other. Perhaps it is both. A <br/>\nnatural tendancy to learn to read???
