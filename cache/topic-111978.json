I feel intimidated sometimes by the depth of Roxana&#39;s  <br/>\nknowledge, and the intensity of some of her interests.  All of Pam&#39;s  <br/>\nkids have taken classes at a college near them.

It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not right, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot totally true (but it might be a little bit true &lt;bwg&gt;), but my  <br/>\nkids probably know as much as her kids do, it&#39;s just way more  <br/>\nscattery.  Pam&#39;s kids know a lot about a few things.  Rosie knows  <br/>\nlots about soccer and horses.  My kids, nothing.  My kids know a  <br/>\nlittle about a lot of things. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t mind that, but I still  <br/>\nhave a pause when I&#39;m around someone whose child is an expert at  <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the deal, though...<br/>\nWhen I was in school, I was relatively expert on The Beatles.   <br/>\nCertainly didn&#39;t learn it in school, but the other kids would ask me  <br/>\nwhen the next album was coming out, or who wrote which songs, or  <br/>\nwhatever.    My best friend played piano better than anyone else in  <br/>\ntown.  She didn&#39;t learn that in school, but school certainly made use  <br/>\nof it, and gave her music credit for being the accompanist for the  <br/>\nchorus class.   (Lame deal, but she enjoyed being there more than  <br/>\ntaking P.E., which it got her out of.)  One friend was a silversmith;  <br/>\nlearned from his dad, and was making jewelry good enough to sell by  <br/>\nhis teens.  Some of the girls from Santa Clara Pueblo were making  <br/>\npotters, and are now considered &quot;potters,&quot; meaning have been making  <br/>\ntraditional pottery all their lives.  When we were kids, they were  <br/>\nexperts already (beginning, but had experience and opportunity others  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have).  Some kids rode rodeo, or trained horses or dogs for  <br/>\nranchwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range of what kids do and what parents know is no broader or more  <br/>\nnarrow among unschoolers than other-but parents whose kids are in  <br/>\nschool have the dubious luxury of leaving it all up to the teachers;  <br/>\nunschooling parents need to wade into the world and start gathering  <br/>\nsome good stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\nYahoo!

That swimming thing, though... you were doing US a favor!   <br/>\nAnd the food was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will pass the compliments on to them, their dad, their grandma... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for the zinging insults (made in fun, but I still feel the  <br/>\nzing), older kids have been really nice to my kids too.  My kids tend  <br/>\nnot to have the urge to zing others (though they can retaliate if  <br/>\nneeded, and they do practice on me sometimes, especially Marty).  But  <br/>\nwhen Kirby was thirteen he started attending midnight-to-whenever  <br/>\nanime club meetings, and was invited, attended to and transported by  <br/>\nvarious older members.  It wasn&#39;t even Kirby&#39;s idea, and he didn&#39;t  <br/>\ncall around for rides.  They would remember him and arrange for  <br/>\nwhichever would take him, or sometimes I would deliver him and he  <br/>\nwould get a ride home with someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty got old enough to be more fun than irritating to Kirby (it  <br/>\nhappened gradually), Kirby started inviting him to gaming sessions  <br/>\nand movies and parties.   Just in the past four months or so, Holly  <br/>\nhas reached the point that either or both of the boys will include  <br/>\nher, too.  That&#39;s a huge relief for me, because the year or two  <br/>\nleading up to that point in both cases led to a lot of hurt feelings  <br/>\nfrom not being invited, and then sometimes invited, and then  <br/>\nexcluded, or not even asked.   The occasional invitation just seemed  <br/>\nto make the &quot;not this time&quot; instances worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no way to avoid those awkward times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a younger neighbor who has periodically tried to get Holly&#39;s  <br/>\nundivided attention (or sometimes will settle for ANY attention), and  <br/>\nthough she used to hang around with his sister, she just can&#39;t get  <br/>\ninto playing with him much, especially now that she&#39;s passed into  <br/>\nreal teen years.  I feel sorry for him.  A couple of times in the  <br/>\npast year she has done a brief thing with him, but it&#39;s more  <br/>\nrejection than agreement (poor guy).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two neighbor girls who ended up not being playmates because  <br/>\nHolly was impatient and frustrated that their opening conversation  <br/>\nwas REPEATEDLY the automatic dialog &quot;Where do you go to school?&quot; and  <br/>\nthe same questions about homeschooling they would have asked if they  <br/>\nhad never met her before.  One went through it three times, and  <br/>\nanother about five, before Holly just started avoiding them.   Partly  <br/>\nit was her feeling that they weren&#39;t really paying any attention to  <br/>\nher or her answers, partly that they were boring, and partly they  <br/>\nseemed jealously disturbed (which is probably why they blanked out on  <br/>\nthe answers—they couldn&#39;t very well process the idea that she really  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have school or lessons).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids really aren&#39;t universally as nice to every human, but they  <br/>\nhave grown up without the prejudices about age that school ingrains  <br/>\nin people, and they&#39;re freer with other unschoolers out of relief at  <br/>\nbeing understood and appreciated instead of being prodded and  <br/>\ninterviewed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8037645,"authorName":"elainegh8","from":"&quot;elainegh8&quot; &lt;elainegh8@...&gt;","profile":"elainegh8","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Geoboards","postDate":"1139848383","msgId":112003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzcWNiditrcHY5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA2N0Y5Qjk0LUE3NTEtNDRFQi1CRTcyLTA4RDg2M0RDRTY2REBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":112001,"nextInTopic":112004,"prevInTime":112002,"nextInTime":112004,"topicId":111978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do you think it would be easy to make a geoboard?

I feel intimidated sometimes by the depth of Roxana&#39;s  <br/>\nknowledge, and the intensity of some of her interests.  All of Pam&#39;s  <br/>\nkids have taken classes at a college near them.  That makes me look  <br/>\nat my kids and think for a fleeting moment that they&#39;re like pound  <br/>\npuppies next to Pam&#39;s show dogs.  It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not right, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnot totally true (but it might be a little bit true &lt;bwg&gt;), but my  <br/>\nkids probably know as much as her kids do, it&#39;s just way more  <br/>\nscattery.  Pam&#39;s kids know a lot about a few things.  Rosie knows  <br/>\nlots about soccer and horses.  My kids, nothing.  My kids know a  <br/>\nlittle about a lot of things. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t mind that, but I still  <br/>\nhave a pause when I&#39;m around someone whose child is an expert at  <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the deal, though...<br/>\nWhen I was in school, I was relatively expert on The Beatles.   <br/>\nCertainly didn&#39;t learn it in school, but the other kids would ask me  <br/>\nwhen the next album was coming out, or who wrote which songs, or  <br/>\nwhatever.    My best friend played piano better than anyone else in  <br/>\ntown.  She didn&#39;t learn that in school, but school certainly made use  <br/>\nof it, and gave her music credit for being the accompanist for the  <br/>\nchorus class.   (Lame deal, but she enjoyed being there more than  <br/>\ntaking P.E., which it got her out of.)  One friend was a silversmith;  <br/>\nlearned from his dad, and was making jewelry good enough to sell by  <br/>\nhis teens.  Some of the girls from Santa Clara Pueblo were making  <br/>\npotters, and are now considered &quot;potters,&quot; meaning have been making  <br/>\ntraditional pottery all their lives.  When we were kids, they were  <br/>\nexperts already (beginning, but had experience and opportunity others  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have).  Some kids rode rodeo, or trained horses or dogs for  <br/>\nranchwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe range of what kids do and what parents know is no broader or more  <br/>\nnarrow among unschoolers than other—but parents whose kids are in  <br/>\nschool have the dubious luxury of leaving it all up to the teachers;  <br/>\nunschooling parents need to wade into the world and start gathering  <br/>\nsome good stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240269371,"authorName":"Erin Erin","from":"Erin Erin &lt;squeakybiscuit@...&gt;","profile":"squeakybiscuit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Not smart enough to unschool","postDate":"1139792818","msgId":111984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyNTMxYjk5MDYwMjEyMTcwNm8xYzU3Yjk2NG82Nzc2NjUxMTI1ODFjYWFjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRzb2o4cys2bGdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRzb2o4cys2bGdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":111983,"nextInTopic":111985,"prevInTime":111983,"nextInTime":111985,"topicId":111978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren, Actually, I m 33 and have three kids.
