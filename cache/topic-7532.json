It is great for holiday <br/>\nprojects.  I know you could buy a commercial paste, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d <br/>\nneed to.  You can mix up flour, water, and glue to whatever thickness you <br/>\nneed or want.  I have made Santa doll heads this way, and attached them to <br/>\nvarious empty bottles, then clothed them.
