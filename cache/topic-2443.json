It is very hard for a<br/>\nmother with young children to do all of the work of running a farm while<br/>\ndaddy commutes to work six days a week just to pay for it.  Been there, done<br/>\nthat.  So we have been meeting with a group of between ten and twenty others<br/>\nwho share the same vision and want to do this work together; not in<br/>\nisolation, to *escape* the city and modern life, but as a conscious choice<br/>\nto be a model for sustainablity and future of society.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I lived in a rural area of Michigan for several years, and<br/>\ndecided that we just couldn&#39;t raise our family there without community of<br/>\npeople who are diverse, tolerant, and care about education.  We feel really<br/>\nblessed to be where we are now; the main drawback to where we live is really<br/>\nonly money, since the cost of living is much higher here then in a small<br/>\ntown without any of the resources.  Funny, but we didn&#39;t have basic things<br/>\nin a poor small town like even access to local produce or u-pick farms that<br/>\nwe do now living in a college town.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at my decision to unschool as right and a responsiblity.  I need to<br/>\nlook at how my life affects society, and what kind of life I choose to work<br/>\ntowards.  Choosing to homeschool has led me to many things that have<br/>\nenriched my life deeply, including permaculture, intentional community, and<br/>\nchoosing a spiritual community that practices tolerance and peace-making.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Brown<br/>\nAnn Arbor, MI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2446,"nextTopicId":2452}}
