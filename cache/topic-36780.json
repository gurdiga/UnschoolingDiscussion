My girls are very big fans of Harry Potter. They have spent a great deal of time online finding the best sites on Harry Potter. This one is so much fun. If you haven&#39;t been to it, you&#39;ve missed on a great chance to hear the words pronounced. Follow this link, then under Harry&#39;s head there is a link for Pronunciations, go to that, scroll down to find the word you want... click on the word, and like magic, it says the word for you. : )<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/index.htm\">http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/index.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36777,"nextTopicId":36784}}
