My oldest (7) has a difficult time controlling himself, especially when he becomes frustrated.  His actions frustrate me and I don&#39;t always respond to him as well as I would like.  I keep reminding myself that if I have a hard time being patient and tolerant with him how can I justify becoming upset with him when he, at 7, has the same trouble with his younger siblings.  It all needs to begin with me.  I wish I could say that I consistently provide him with a great example of how to interact with people.  I owe it to him as his mom to strive harder to be that great example.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Susan V <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Discipline question...","postDate":"1076569415","msgId":90915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMS4xOTVjODNmZi4yZDVjN2Y0N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90912,"nextInTopic":90941,"prevInTime":90914,"nextInTime":90916,"topicId":90734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/11/04 5:22:54 PM, dezigna@comcast.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1646802182\">In a message dated 2/11/04 5:22:54 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Jayn lashes out much less than she used to, and mostly just with<br/>\n<br/>\nDaddy – so I can’t help feeling sometimes his neediness for her affection is<br/>\n<br/>\npart of the cause of some of her rejecting of him behavior. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll ditto, Keith and Kirby, when Kirby was the only.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt really stuck between, but in a weird way Keith was the needier of the <br/>\ntwo.

For me both are about respectful relationships with my children, for that matter reflective of relationships with all people in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for &quot;correcting&quot; a childs hurumpf or shoey...I will sometimes let my kids know that I don&#39;t want to be spoken to in a certain way and ask them to reframe their comment in a way that I can understand.  The same way I might respectfully ask my dh not to shout at me as I can&#39;t hear what he is saying.  &quot;You speak so loud, I can&#39;t hear what you are saying.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s about respectful communication.  For instance, &quot;I really want to understand what you mean, could you please say it again.  Perhaps using different words.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other times, that i just need to accept that in the moment the other person is frustrated and not expressing themself in a way that I would prefer - but we&#39;re human beings, make mistakes and when i am trully centered i can give them room to poor communicators without it affecting my perception of them (or myself) on the whole.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel this is all so important to the whole realm of unschooling.  We do alot of problem solving in our family, giving everyone a chance to express their feelings and giving everyone a chance to respond with their ideas on making things work better for everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nbtw - i hardly use the word unschooling to my husband.  i do however express my need to include everyone in conversations that affect us all and focus on coming to solutions that work for everyone involved.  when we stick to it - it always, always works...sometimes it just takes time, and sometimes not everyone is ready or willing to work on the solution in that moment.  but we get better and better at making sure everyone trully feels comfortable with the solutions and noone feels coerced or manipulated.  AND - the kids inevitably come up with the best solutions - those that i or my husband would never think of myself - as we are so over conditioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Discipline question...","postDate":"1076535111","msgId":90864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWMzZjBlNiQ3NmM2ZjMwMCQ2ZjRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDFjZS4xOTZhZGMyNC4yZDViZDViMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":90853,"nextInTopic":90888,"prevInTime":90863,"nextInTime":90865,"topicId":90734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If it&#39;s some words or action they use daily that is hurting others&#39; feelings, and you can give them another set of words that is more &quot;acceptable&quot; and explain why, I don&#39;t think it will take too long for them to figure it out with a few reminders.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf however, the behaviour is the result of frustration, I think it takes more time and experience for them to learn the skills to monitor their words and actions and to consider how their words and actions will make others feel *before* reacting.  And to remember that even if you think it&#39;s nothing worth getting frustrated over, if they are, they are.  You have to start there.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She might just grow out of it, but it&#39;s not fair to him to have to wait through the experiment in discomfort.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I would try to help him not feel frustrated.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve kind of work it from both ends.  I explain to my husband, in private, how his words and/or actions could have contributed to the incident or to the escalation of the incident.  Trying to show him what the situation probably looked like through their eyes, and why they reacted as they did (and age and experience is a factor here).  And we might discuss how he could get his point across next time without causing so much friction or frustration for him or them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I also speak with the kids, individually, about how their words and/or actions were probably seen and felt through his eyes.  And what they might say or do in a similar situation in the future so they can get their point across without inadvertently hurting the feelings of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and once in a while letting dh know that I am talking with them regularly about these issues ... since you don&#39;t normally see behaviour changes overnight!  So he doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m just blowing off his reaction and feelings.  It also helps him to see that our oldest (he&#39;s almost 12) is really starting to come into his own in this area.  No more big tantrums with seemingly minor provocation, the self-confidence to express himself and his frustration to his dad (and me!) without getting angry, the ability to say first when he&#39;s getting angry or frustrated and to warn that he&#39;ll leave the room if the discussion continues in the same vein etc.  He&#39;s even taken to telling his younger brother and sister that they are lucky he&#39;s skilled at anger management when they are frustrating him.  :)  He used to lash out first, talk later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly takes more time than sending them into timeout or taking away &quot;privileges&quot;, but I know they learn a whole lot more about themselves and others.

He is being four.  This is where he is supposed to <br/>\nbe.  I never know how to answer that &quot;the discipline has been going on for <br/>\n100&#39;s of years&quot; statement.  And something tells me that some of you may have<br/>\n<br/>\nsome good answers, or at least lead me to some website that has more <br/>\ninformation.  In addition, my husband often makes note that I am very <br/>\n&quot;defensive&quot; when it comes to discussing our children, and am not &quot;open <br/>\nminded&quot; to &quot;different&quot; was of disciplining them.  I don&#39;t think I am being <br/>\ndefensive, I just don&#39;t agree with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help is appreciated.  And has anybody else had very different ideas <br/>\nregarding discipline with their spouses, and how did you handle it?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are not in agreement on the Principles that you are<br/>\nliving by.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that giving James (dh) whole books or lectures didn�t help him to<br/>\nget it, but made him  feel defensive and overwhelmed. Instead I forward some<br/>\npithy e-mails and the occasional online article.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe second suggestion I have is by all means bring him to the conference so<br/>\nthat he can see the other kids, and get a glimpse into the wonderful future<br/>\nin store for him with the older ones. It took the conference for it to<br/>\ncrystallize for me that unschooled younger children do not look/behave like<br/>\ntraditionally parented younger children. There is a greater tolerance (even<br/>\nencouragement) for wildness and spiritedness and fearlessness in the littler<br/>\nones, who miraculously become older children with genuine self control and<br/>\ncharm. The focus here is on finding ways to facilitate the spirited play,<br/>\nwithout it being too exhausting and infuriating for everyone around. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (4) does things that upset my dh way more than they do me, like hitting<br/>\nhim sometimes, telling us to �shoo�, and saying �Hummph� turning up her<br/>\nnose. He can�t stand the hitting and what he calls meanness and ingratitude.<br/>\nI think it is mostly her melting down temporarily. He starts ranting about<br/>\nhow we �have tried your way and it isn�t working� and that we need to find<br/>\nsomething else to �do� -  �we respect her but she doesn�t respect us�. Some<br/>\nof his suggestions are punishments � like take a toy away. I find if I try<br/>\nto argue with him it just accelerates and turns into an argument about me<br/>\nnot supporting him, or my character defects, and other<br/>\nunrelated-to-the-situation stuff. It is hard not to argue because I am so<br/>\ndefinitely opposed to all of his �suggestions�. However I have come to<br/>\nrealize that he is *not* actually making genuine or serious suggestions,<br/>\nmore like venting his frustration. If I let him go on, he starts hearing<br/>\nhimself and how dopey his ideas are. I don�t believe he ever seriously<br/>\nintends to implement any of it since he just winds down and ends up being<br/>\njust as sweet to Jayn as always. So I try to limit my comments to how she is<br/>\njust 4, and reassure him that this is normal stuff. It is hard for me not to<br/>\njump to the defense of all things unschooling, but in this situation, with a<br/>\ndh who does get it and sometimes just needs to remind himself, keeping still<br/>\nis best.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes even my wonderful dh calls what we are doing, �doing nothing�<br/>\nabout behavior issues. It can look like nothing compared to the active<br/>\ncontrolling and punishing of traditional parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Well it has all been clicking for me everyday since <br/>\nthen as I loosen up more and more - and my children are the happiest they <br/>\nhave ever been in their short lives (they are 3 and 4).  I just wanted to <br/>\ntell you guys &quot;thank you&quot; for doing this post, and that it has changed all <br/>\nof our lives dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to my question.  I haven&#39;t read anything about this since I have been <br/>\nhere, unless I somehow completely missed something.  I will try to keep it <br/>\nshort.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband just got back from Missouri.  He noticed how much more &quot;quiet&quot; <br/>\nhis nieces and nephews were.  They weren&#39;t constantly asking questions, <br/>\ndebating with him and their parents, etc.  I have always encouraged my kids <br/>\nto stand up for themselves, work on their skills with talking (debating) <br/>\nwith other people.  I believe that my husband thinks that they are too <br/>\n&quot;bold&quot; and &quot;spoiled&quot; for their age.  Yes, our children are quite headstrong <br/>\nand talk a lot, but they are not &quot;bratty.&quot;  But I think to him they are <br/>\nbecause they aren&#39;t quietly amusing themselves.  Are you with me still?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI then made mention later during another conversation that I did not agree <br/>\nwith sending your child to put their nose in a corner for discipline <br/>\nmeasures.  This kind of riled him up because doing that isn&#39;t &quot;that bad!&quot;  <br/>\nHe then went into the whole speech of &quot;Parents have been <br/>\ndiscipling/spanking/putting the nose in the corner with their kids for 100&#39;s <br/>\nof years!  And now they say how &#39;bad&#39; it is!!&quot;  I am sure you have heard <br/>\nthat argument before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand where my husband is coming from (I don&#39;t agree with him <br/>\nthough).  He was raised that way, so what is wrong with it now (his line of <br/>\nthinking)?  I think he feels like our kids run all over us.  I also think <br/>\nthat after being with his relative&#39;s kids who are so &quot;well behaved&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;quiet,&quot; that he is worried that we have &quot;no control&quot; over our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne example.  In the car we were driving.  My son had a constant barrage of <br/>\nquestions about everything.  To me they were legitimate 4-year-old <br/>\nquestions.  To my husband (who was tired) they were annoying and he didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand why my son just couldn&#39;t be quiet so us adults could talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example.  My two kids get in a fight.  I take the time to ask each <br/>\none what happened (just started separating them to do that - good advice), <br/>\nand then discuss better ways to handle it, another way to say something, <br/>\netc.  My husband sometimes makes the effort to deal with it, but other times <br/>\nhe just gets mad at them or will send the one (who appears) to be the <br/>\naggressor into time out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the problem is, I never really know how to get through to my husband that <br/>\nmy son isn&#39;t annoying.  He is being four.  This is where he is supposed to <br/>\nbe.  I never know how to answer that &quot;the discipline has been going on for <br/>\n100&#39;s of years&quot; statement.
