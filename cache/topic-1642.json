Hence, we are unschooling. I realized<br/>\n that , for right now, they are not into these pre-packaged learning<br/>\n experiences.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We consider what we are doing with B5IAR as unschooling.  The activites are <br/>\ndone informally,and we don&#39;t do what they don&#39;t want to do.   We don&#39;t follow <br/>\nthe guide strictly (thus we would be schooling then) and we do it when we <br/>\nfeel energized and want to take something on.  The boys have been very <br/>\npositive and interested in this Thomas Edison unit.  I don&#39;t think <br/>\nunschooling has to mean using nothing and hoping like heck your kids can find <br/>\nthe answers to their questions.  I for one am not always stimulating and <br/>\nspontaneous and I find I need help now and again to show the boys some really <br/>\ncool things that just shouldn&#39;t be passed up or looked past.  I do believe in <br/>\nstimulating the mind and trying new experiences.  Stopping the children so <br/>\nthey can look at things they otherwise may have looked straight past.  And <br/>\nhaving a child who in the past sufferend from ADHD, it has indeed been <br/>\ncrucial for us to provide a stimulating environment.  And I know they would <br/>\nnever want to read Sarah, Plain and Tall, hahaha! <br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, a great deal of this can be done as dinner conversations or <br/>\n&quot;let&#39;s try this see what happens&quot; type of stuff.  I will blurt out a few <br/>\npoints in the car, and we will discuss it far as we like.   And my guys <br/>\nwanted to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though we are unschooling also, i use B5IAR to increase my knowledge <br/>\nbase and my creativity and they are learning how to dive into things a little <br/>\nmore deeply.  they are asking more questions about why things are they way <br/>\nthey are and how things work.. This unit along with other things we are doing <br/>\nhas stimulated something in them that was lying formant for sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince they previously were in a public school situation... they had to find <br/>\nout that learning can actually be fun and things you thought you would hate <br/>\nmay be interesting after all.  I have heard them time and again say that <br/>\nnever would have thought some of the things we do are fun, but much to their <br/>\nsurprise and my delight, they are enjoying a variety of things.  But it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t appear that they would not have picked these things up or asked to do <br/>\nthem...because they think &quot;learning things&#39; in general suck.  So, Mom is <br/>\ndoing a bit of stimulation for now and it is paying off big time.  I am <br/>\nexposing them to things they otherwise would have passed up.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my goodness, i do believe their minds are opening and they are becoming <br/>\nmore willing to learn and experience things outside of their previously <br/>\ncomfortable box.  So B5IAR is benefitting us just fine right now...and it <br/>\nalso expanding my mind, which also needed some prying open :-)  I am getting <br/>\nbetter at answering impromptu questions and finding the answers to questions <br/>\nI have.  And before the boys wouldn&#39;t touch books outside of Goosebumps or <br/>\nAnimorphs without putting up a battle.  Now they see that you can&#39;t judge a <br/>\nbook by its cover and you might actually enjoy what is written in the pages <br/>\ninside.  For this I am extremely thankful... I was a bit worried about it :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nAndi, check out the website that one of the members posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1644,"nextTopicId":1648}}
