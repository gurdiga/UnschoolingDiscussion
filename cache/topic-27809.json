He started at nine (somewhat late for that school) and is <br/>\nstill there at 15.  The two teens who outranked him have left for <br/>\nextracurricular school stuff now, and he&#39;s the ranking kid.  The school <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t allow black belts before the age of 18, but he cares nothing for <br/>\nthat, because a large part of their training is personal best and team <br/>\neffort, respect for the tradition, and not advancement or glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who know about such things, it&#39;s Shorin-Ryu, and Ed Erler is the <br/>\nSensei.  Kirby has participated in some of the regional seminars they sponsor <br/>\nwith visiting teachers.  In those he&#39;s usually been the youngest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went because he wants to.
