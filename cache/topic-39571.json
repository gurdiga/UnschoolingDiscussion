He found<br/>\nfriends in our neighborhood and through classes, workshops at museums and<br/>\nart centers when we lived in New Haven. He mostly had one good friend at a<br/>\ntime and they were mostly school kids, so he had limited time with them.<br/>\nSometimes he wished out loud that he could get together with them more<br/>\noften. But mostly he was content to spend time with us or on his own. In his<br/>\nteen years it seemed to us he was in his room  most of the time (listening<br/>\nto music, books on tape while he worked on origami or Warhammer or computer<br/>\ngames). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was 18 he decided to go to college in NYC. Found a roommate &<br/>\napartment, became a real social butterfly. He studied film and political<br/>\nscience. One of the things he likes about making films is it&#39;s an art form<br/>\nthat (usually) you create with a lot of other people. He graduated this<br/>\nspring & will return tomorrow from 7 weeks in Europe, traveling with 3<br/>\nfriends. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he had been unhappy about lack of friends, we would have made more of an<br/>\neffort to provide &quot;social opportunities.&quot;  But his &quot;low key&quot; social life<br/>\ndidn&#39;t hold him back at all once he was ready to move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s never too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A question probably answered 1,000x","postDate":"1027979346","msgId":39582,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNENDVCODUyLkFFOEI4REJCQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzI5MTUyNjE0LjI5MjgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyMTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39578,"nextInTopic":39602,"prevInTime":39581,"nextInTime":39583,"topicId":39571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How about... scouts 4h sports play dates set up by mom starting your own homeschooling group Joylyn ...

How will my daughter socialize with other kids?  It seems the common answer is through homeschool groups.  Well, as I posted earlier, I live basically in the middle of nowhere on a dead end road in southern Oklahoma.  The closest town of 25,000 has one homeschool group & they require a Faith statement.  But more than that, I know several people in it - they are very fundamental Christians which is their choice and I respect that.  But every time I get near them, they try to convert me.  I don&#39;t want that for my daughter.  Also, my daughter is an only child, so she won&#39;t learn with brothers/sisters.  I am VERY concerned about sending her to public school - but I don&#39;t want to isolate her, either.  It&#39;s bad enough that, although we attend the most liberal church in the area, I spend every sunday &quot;de-programming&quot; her from Sunday School.  On the plus side, she is learning at a very young age to question the facts we are spoon fed.  I would love to hear from other homeschoolers of only children?!?  <br/>\n<br/>\nCat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
