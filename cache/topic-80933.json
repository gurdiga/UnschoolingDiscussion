It&#39;s a discussion list for discussing<br/>\nunschooling ideas. Here&#39;s the list description. The 4th paragraph defines<br/>\nthe purpose of the list pretty clearly I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unschooling is not a homeschool teaching method. It refers to a philosophy of<br/>\n&gt; natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results from living according<br/>\n&gt; to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with an<br/>\n&gt; intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what intrigues<br/>\n&gt; them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally satisfying way.<br/>\n&gt; Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to choose the what, when,<br/>\n&gt; where and how of his/her own learning from mud puddles to video games and<br/>\n&gt; SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an unschooling parent sees his/her<br/>\n&gt; role, not as a teacher, but as a facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; exploration of the world.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is a mindful lifestyle which encompasses, at its core, an<br/>\n&gt; atmosphere of trust, freedom, joy and deep respect for who the child is. This<br/>\n&gt; cannot be lived on a part-time basis. Unschooling sometimes seems so intuitive<br/>\n&gt; that people feel they&#39;ve been doing it all along, not realizing it has a name.<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling sometimes seems so counterintuitive that people struggle to<br/>\n&gt; understand it, and it can take years to fully accept its worth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as we<br/>\n&gt; critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning, and seek<br/>\n&gt; a deeper understanding of unschooling and more respectful relationships with<br/>\n&gt; our children. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please read for at least a week or two, before posting, to get a feel for the<br/>\n&gt; list. New members are on moderation, to avoid spam and other disruptions.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; can be found in the files area of this list or, along<br/>\n&gt; with other list information, at: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/lists/info\">http://www.sandradodd.com/lists/info</a>&gt;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have questions, contact:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>\n&gt; (This list is jointly owned by Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian and Sandra<br/>\n&gt; Dodd.) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Pam just posted the short form of the guidelines, but here it is in the<br/>\nlonger form in case that makes the purpose of the list clearer for anyone:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; UnschoolingDiscussion Posting Policies<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is our sincere wish to provide a forum for those seeking to deepen their<br/>\n&gt; understanding of the unschooling philosophy. The primary purpose of this<br/>\n&gt; list is to encourage the critical examination of ideas, beliefs and<br/>\n&gt; viewpoints. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Questioning of deeply-held ideas and beliefs can be very uncomfortable and<br/>\n&gt; sometimes responses to that process can stand in the way of people getting<br/>\n&gt; what they need out of the list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Therefore, we offer the following guidelines to help our members get the<br/>\n&gt; most from the list:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1. Read for at least a couple of weeks before posting yourself. Spend that<br/>\n&gt; time getting a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members. This will help you<br/>\n&gt; decide if this list is worth your time or whether some other list might be<br/>\n&gt; more useful to you in meeting your needs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity to<br/>\n&gt; critically examine your own ideas.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3. When differences of opinion arise, stick to discussing ideas, not the<br/>\n&gt; person with whom you are disagreeing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to public<br/>\n&gt; examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 5. Before you hit &quot;send,&quot; consider whether your post will contribute<br/>\n&gt; positively to the unschooling discussion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 6. Avoid using loaded terminology. For instance, &quot;If you have no TV<br/>\n&gt; restrictions why don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?&quot; will get you more<br/>\n&gt; useful responses than, &quot;I don&#39;t see how your kids learn anything if all they<br/>\n&gt; ever do is sit around like zombies watching unlimited TV.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 7. It is not useful to inform the list that you believe someone else is<br/>\n&gt; being rude or discourteous; please trust the rest of the list to recognize<br/>\n&gt; rudeness for themselves. Saying, &quot;Jane was rude to me,&quot; just bogs down the<br/>\n&gt; list. It is also a waste of everyone&#39;s time when participants attempt to<br/>\n&gt; correct or improve other list members&#39; manners. It never works and always<br/>\n&gt; disrupts the list. Avoid<br/>\n&gt; statements such as: &quot;Jane, here is my suggestion of how you could write more<br/>\n&gt; nicely so people wouldn&#39;t think you are being rude.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8. Our brains automatically supply a &quot;tone&quot; to posts as we read. It can be<br/>\n&gt; helpful to imagine your best friend speaking the words you are reading, in<br/>\n&gt; the gentlest, most well-meaning tone you can imagine. It is unacceptable to<br/>\n&gt; attack the &quot;tone&quot; of the list or to make generalizations about it. &quot;I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been on many other lists and this one is the rudest I&#39;ve seen,&quot; would be<br/>\n&gt; unacceptable. Instead, attempt to create a positive, helpful tone with your<br/>\n&gt; own posts by setting the example you hope others will follow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 9. Envision every post and response as a dish at a potluck dinner. You won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; love every dish at a potluck any more than you will love every poster&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; style of help. But a dish/post may be exactly what someone else needs. If<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t like a certain list member&#39;s offerings, skip them and<br/>\n&gt; leave them for others.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 10. Read and write as clearly as you can. In casual conversation we often<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t realize how much we rely on others to fill in the gist of our<br/>\n&gt; conversation based on what they expect us to say. But here, without body<br/>\n&gt; language or inflection, all we have to go on are your words and they should<br/>\n&gt; say what you mean. If you say, for example, you &quot;never&quot; do something, it<br/>\n&gt; should not mean &quot;almost never.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our goal is to make the list as useful as possible for those seeking to<br/>\n&gt; deepen their understanding of the unschooling philosophy. To do that, all<br/>\n&gt; new list members are initially moderated to prevent spamming and catch posts<br/>\n&gt; that could disrupt the list. People will also be moderated if they disrupt<br/>\n&gt; the usefulness of the list. Potentially disruptive posts will be returned<br/>\n&gt; for revision. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you have questions, please write to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] choices","postDate":"1064084106","msgId":81029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzNUFCQ0Q5LUVCOUItMTFENy1CMzY1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHAwNTIwMGYxNGJiOTI0ZDkwOTA5OUBbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+"},"prevInTopic":81024,"nextInTopic":81054,"prevInTime":81028,"nextInTime":81030,"topicId":80933,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Compassion?

Unassisted childbirth, no immunizations, don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve in medical care of any kind except if I&#39;m on the brink of <br/>\ndeath, Unschooling, unhindered adolescence, childhood autonomy, <br/>\nextended breastfeeding, family bed, psychic experiences, belief in <br/>\ntime travel and alternate realities, use of the zero-point field and <br/>\ndirected intention to &quot;create your own reality&quot;.....this all goes <br/>\ntogether, as a lifestyle, for me.  It is all about unlimited personal <br/>\nfreedom and using the power God/nature gave us to change our lives <br/>\nand the world.   We live by two principles:  don&#39;t cause harm, and <br/>\ndon&#39;t take the un-given.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is uncomforable with some aspect of my lifestyle, that is <br/>\nnot bad.  It isn&#39;t causing them harm to be uncomfortable.   It&#39;s <br/>\ncausing them to look at something maybe they haven&#39;t looked at <br/>\nbefore.  It&#39;s causing them to consider things that are new to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I believe that before we come here, we make an agreement with <br/>\npeople to participate in certain events together, I believe that the <br/>\nperson who might see me naked agreed with me before we came here that <br/>\nwe should both participate in this event.   Therefore, whatever <br/>\nreaction they have, they chose to have that reaction long before we <br/>\nactually had that experience together.  Whatever lesson they had to <br/>\nlearn from it, they chose it.  I don&#39;t have to feel bad about what <br/>\nthey are experiencing.  It&#39;s part of what has to happen to them for <br/>\nthem to choose to make their part of the world better by changing <br/>\ntheir attitudes.  If they don&#39;t, well, there&#39;s a lesson there too, <br/>\nperhaps to be worked out in another lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81101,"nextTopicId":81204}}
