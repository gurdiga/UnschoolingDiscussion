He&#39;s gotten<br/>\nkind of used to it.  When I get a call I just tell him that it&#39;s a business<br/>\ncall and &quot;most&quot; of<br/>\nthe time he&#39;s patient.  I also talk to folks sometimes when we are out and<br/>\nabout and I&#39;m<br/>\nlooking for prospects, sometimes he does well, sometimes I slip him a<br/>\nquarter for the nearby<br/>\ngum ball machine.  I do more of my serious work in the evening a few nights<br/>\na week when my<br/>\nhusband is home.  I also keep in touch via e-mail to folks already with my<br/>\ncompany or<br/>\ninterested in my company.  Right now, I&#39;m grabbing some time as my son is<br/>\nplaying with<br/>\nneighbors in the back.  I always have to be alert and ready to any change.<br/>\nI also have to<br/>\nmake sure I make time for my family.

The paper has dutifully earned<br/>\n&gt; its reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br/>\n&gt; on just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the<br/>\n&gt; newspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has<br/>\n&gt; formerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the<br/>\n&gt; article never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school<br/>\n&gt; system has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well,<br/>\n&gt; maybe in the next election....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the<br/>\n&gt; street, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian Covert<br/>\n&gt; (KnoK NEWS)<br/>\n&gt; in Osaka, Japan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EDITORIAL - The Japan Times<br/>\n&gt; Tuesday, June 20, 2000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be<br/>\n&gt; difficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading<br/>\n&gt; up to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling<br/>\n&gt; and opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and<br/>\n&gt; sloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of<br/>\n&gt; the main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of<br/>\n&gt; juvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all<br/>\n&gt; seem powerless to control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds.<br/>\n&gt; But as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of<br/>\n&gt; youthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped<br/>\n&gt; to as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are<br/>\n&gt; mainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young<br/>\n&gt; people legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister<br/>\n&gt; Yoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and<br/>\n&gt; its partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in<br/>\n&gt; controlling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him<br/>\n&gt; in instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on<br/>\n&gt; reducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for<br/>\n&gt; serious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the<br/>\n&gt; public&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which<br/>\n&gt; ended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded<br/>\n&gt; bill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase<br/>\n&gt; in youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the<br/>\n&gt; rehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction<br/>\n&gt; over cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving<br/>\n&gt; youths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a<br/>\n&gt; criminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred.<br/>\n&gt; Juveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be<br/>\n&gt; considered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation<br/>\n&gt; office for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated,<br/>\n&gt; and the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people<br/>\n&gt; now believe the law is too lenient.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Young people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than<br/>\n&gt; their counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more<br/>\n&gt; sophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and<br/>\n&gt; the influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more<br/>\n&gt; mature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if<br/>\n&gt; challenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the<br/>\n&gt; knowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a<br/>\n&gt; step many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that<br/>\n&gt; the Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that<br/>\n&gt; age. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be<br/>\n&gt; discussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and<br/>\n&gt; law-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall<br/>\n&gt; back on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage<br/>\n&gt; criminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is<br/>\n&gt; why so many young people in this country now resort to violence so<br/>\n&gt; easily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by<br/>\n&gt; the Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the<br/>\n&gt; more likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or<br/>\n&gt; teachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police<br/>\n&gt; throughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or<br/>\n&gt; attempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of<br/>\n&gt; April, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as<br/>\n&gt; a cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in<br/>\n&gt; juvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives<br/>\n&gt; for the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents<br/>\n&gt; and teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young<br/>\n&gt; miscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them<br/>\n&gt; into hardened criminals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Copyright - The Japan Times: June 20, 2000]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 12:54:55 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unused crib<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not once her legs got long enough to...never mind, I&#39;m sure you<br/>\n&gt; get the idea...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 17 Jun 2000, at 11:35, Holly Atchison wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is so cute!!!\u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 12:54:55 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: NPR Diane Rehm show 6/20/00 - Homeschooling!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just realised, I&#39;m not going to be at home at this time anyway<br/>\n&gt; :-(  D&#39;you think it&#39;ll be archived or something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 17 Jun 2000, at 11:25, Holly Atchison wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If its on NPR it should be online because there are a<br/>\n&gt; lot of NPR stations \u000f<br/>\n&gt; online\u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 13:04:06 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unused crib<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a mattress on a sprung or wooden base.

He will go and lay down<br/>\n&gt; in his bed when he is tired(he is going to be 2 July 7th).  My oldest (3<br/>\n&gt; 1/2) still likes someone to lay down with him, and he co-sleeps with his<br/>\n&gt; brother.  They still get up and want someone in there at night sometimes -<br/>\n&gt; hubby gets that job.  He enjoys it really.  They are just different children<br/>\n&gt; with different needs.  My oldest though is more outgoing to strangers - goes<br/>\n&gt; up to them and talks with them.  My youngest will wander off and not even<br/>\n&gt; look back.

The paper has dutifully earned<br/>\n&gt; its reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br/>\n&gt; on just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the<br/>\n&gt; newspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has<br/>\n&gt; formerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the<br/>\n&gt; article never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school<br/>\n&gt; system has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well,<br/>\n&gt; maybe in the next election....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the<br/>\n&gt; street, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Brian Covert<br/>\n&gt; (KnoK NEWS)<br/>\n&gt; in Osaka, Japan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; EDITORIAL - The Japan Times<br/>\n&gt; Tuesday, June 20, 2000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; AGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be<br/>\n&gt; difficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading<br/>\n&gt; up to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling<br/>\n&gt; and opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and<br/>\n&gt; sloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of<br/>\n&gt; the main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of<br/>\n&gt; juvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all<br/>\n&gt; seem powerless to control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds.<br/>\n&gt; But as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of<br/>\n&gt; youthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped<br/>\n&gt; to as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are<br/>\n&gt; mainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young<br/>\n&gt; people legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister<br/>\n&gt; Yoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and<br/>\n&gt; its partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in<br/>\n&gt; controlling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him<br/>\n&gt; in instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on<br/>\n&gt; reducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for<br/>\n&gt; serious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the<br/>\n&gt; public&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which<br/>\n&gt; ended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded<br/>\n&gt; bill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase<br/>\n&gt; in youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the<br/>\n&gt; rehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction<br/>\n&gt; over cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving<br/>\n&gt; youths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a<br/>\n&gt; criminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred.<br/>\n&gt; Juveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be<br/>\n&gt; considered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation<br/>\n&gt; office for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated,<br/>\n&gt; and the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people<br/>\n&gt; now believe the law is too lenient.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Young people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than<br/>\n&gt; their counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more<br/>\n&gt; sophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and<br/>\n&gt; the influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more<br/>\n&gt; mature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if<br/>\n&gt; challenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the<br/>\n&gt; knowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a<br/>\n&gt; step many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that<br/>\n&gt; the Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that<br/>\n&gt; age. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be<br/>\n&gt; discussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and<br/>\n&gt; law-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall<br/>\n&gt; back on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage<br/>\n&gt; criminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is<br/>\n&gt; why so many young people in this country now resort to violence so<br/>\n&gt; easily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by<br/>\n&gt; the Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the<br/>\n&gt; more likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or<br/>\n&gt; teachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police<br/>\n&gt; throughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or<br/>\n&gt; attempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of<br/>\n&gt; April, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as<br/>\n&gt; a cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in<br/>\n&gt; juvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives<br/>\n&gt; for the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents<br/>\n&gt; and teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young<br/>\n&gt; miscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them<br/>\n&gt; into hardened criminals.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Copyright - The Japan Times: June 20, 2000]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 12:54:55 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unused crib<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not once her legs got long enough to...never mind, I&#39;m sure you<br/>\n&gt; get the idea...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 17 Jun 2000, at 11:35, Holly Atchison wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is so cute!!!\u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 12:54:55 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: NPR Diane Rehm show 6/20/00 - Homeschooling!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just realised, I&#39;m not going to be at home at this time anyway<br/>\n&gt; :-(  D&#39;you think it&#39;ll be archived or something?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 17 Jun 2000, at 11:25, Holly Atchison wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If its on NPR it should be online because there are a<br/>\n&gt; lot of NPR stations \u000f<br/>\n&gt; online\u000f<br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2000 13:04:06 +0100<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: unused crib<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not a mattress on a sprung or wooden base.

He also suggested we could spend some time<br/>\n&gt; drawing and coloring monsters and then we could drive around the neighborhood<br/>\n&gt; (It&#39;s 110 here today in the desert) and look for them.  I&#39;m very open and<br/>\n&gt; willing to do this an I guess this is what unschooling is all about.  The<br/>\n&gt; baby (9months) is exploring walking now anyway and seems quite entertained by<br/>\n&gt; his brother being here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll continue to be constantly concerned about both of them and &quot;the right<br/>\n&gt; thing&quot; but that&#39;s my Virgo perfectionism coming out (LOL)...
