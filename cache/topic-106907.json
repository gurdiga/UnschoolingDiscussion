It has mostly been made up <br/>\nof relaxed homeschoolers and unschoolers. One of the things have talked <br/>\nabout for years is having a&quot;space&quot; to hang out, having meetings in and <br/>\ndo activities that are not great for someone&#39;s home.<br/>\nOne of the other founding members of Live and Learn began working at an <br/>\nafter school care program at their church which had a lot of unused <br/>\nspace. She asked them if it could be rented and they were willing to <br/>\nrent it at a very, very cheap price. We have one main room that was once <br/>\ntheir sanctuary, a kitchen, den, 2 &quot;classrooms&quot; and use of the gym, <br/>\nplayground and grounds. We&#39;re there from 10ish to about 2:30 on Tuesdays <br/>\nand Thursdays and we have a $20 a month fee. We decided not to be <br/>\naffiliated with our support group, but most of the members of the <br/>\nHomeschool Zone come from there. I think we have 15 - 20 families who pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI call it perpetual recess which is a title I stole from an article in HEM :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/211/jfrecess.html\">http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/211/jfrecess.html</a><br/>\nlast year about a co-op in the northeast. Our initial idea was to have a <br/>\npart-time &quot;free-school&quot; type of situation. We soon realized that in this <br/>\npart of the country a freeschool was not gonna happen and its become <br/>\nmore like a very loosely run co-op. We&#39;ve found that in this part of the <br/>\ncountry even a loosely run, non-religious, non-corrosive, free-choice, <br/>\nits-ok-to-hang-out-and-play-video-games-all-day co-op has a hard time <br/>\nattracting members. Everyone is just too busy &quot;homeschooling&quot; and if <br/>\nthey are going to do something that might take time out of their &quot;school <br/>\nday&quot; it had better fill some kind of educational need.<br/>\n~meh~<br/>\nSo we have a weekly schedule that comes out via email. This week&#39;s <br/>\nschedule looked like this:<br/>\n10-? Music Morning (one of the moms brings her accordion and auto harp <br/>\nand will play tunes for us to sing to. Yesterday it was Beatles songs <br/>\nand then she began teaching another mom who to play the autoharp)<br/>\nDuring this time &quot;doll club&quot; was happening and video games were being <br/>\nplayed also.<br/>\nThere was also moms sitting around talking, Tuckervill was in town so it <br/>\nwas nice to sit and talk to her about the baby. We talked some abut the <br/>\nfunshop I&#39;m gonna try and do at the Live and Learn conference. I think <br/>\nthe girls went outside at some point to ride scooters.<br/>\n11:45 Lunch<br/>\n12:45 Cartooning  (I&#39;m meeting with some kids and moms who want to work <br/>\non drawing cartoons. We&#39;re all working out of different books and off <br/>\nand on I&#39;ll point out something, but its fun just to work with others) <br/>\nduring this time moms with younger kids went to the playground.<br/>\nThe rest of the day kids played and hung out. I know at some point there <br/>\nwere a few guys out front hacking and slashing with boffer swords. I <br/>\nknow they went to the gym for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday is like this:<br/>\n10ish Old Tyme show and tell (bring in antiques and heirlooms and talk <br/>\nabout them...this is facilitated by a 9yr old girl)<br/>\n10:45 Digital scavenger hunt   (this is being facilitated by an 11 yr <br/>\nold. He is coming up with a list and we will break into groups with a <br/>\nvan and digital camera and go find what is on his list. Afterwards we <br/>\nwill come back and look through the pics to see who found what.)<br/>\n11:45ish Lunch<br/>\n1:00 Cheerleading (one of our moms does this and we have this group of <br/>\nlittle girls who just adore it)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost days have more in them. I like the lightly scheduled days, but a <br/>\ngood amount of members just won&#39;t come if there is nothing scheduled. <br/>\nThey miss the best days at the Zone because those days end up being so <br/>\nmuch better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like fun, huh?<br/>\nFor us it is---we have all we need there in an endless supply of boys <br/>\n(and some girls) who will hang out with Josh and play VG or boffer <br/>\nswords. Sometimes he will get out Heroscape and play that. He does the <br/>\ncartooning with me and if there is some type of theater thing (like <br/>\nimporv) going on will join in those classes. The truth is it is more <br/>\nstressful for me. I make the schulde and deal with the complaints that <br/>\nthere is not &quot;anything I can&#39;t do at home. Why would I miss a day of <br/>\nschool to do something I can do at home with my kids?&quot;---arrggghhh, then <br/>\nplan something you find value in and see if anyone else wants to do it. <br/>\nI really think that this would be the case among any group of folks who <br/>\nhave some very distinct differences in how they raise their children and <br/>\nhow they homeschool. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is working, there is just <br/>\nalways a group of folks with in any homeschooling thing I&#39;ve ever been <br/>\ninvolved in who want so much but want everyone else to do the work.<br/>\n~sheesh~<br/>\nI also spend time running interference for Josh and the moms who have <br/>\nproblems with VG.<br/>\nThis was our 1st year and over the summer we will go to just Thursdays <br/>\nand discuss what worked and what did not work this year. One thing that <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed is that the child facilitated activities seem to be better <br/>\nattended and enjoyed, I also have seen a few flop because the child <br/>\nfacilitating had no support from their parent.<br/>\nWe also have a lack of teens. I hope we can work on getting more <br/>\nfamilies with older kids involved next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/\">http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"sheila","from":"&quot;sheila&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Perpetual Recess","postDate":"1119420445","msgId":106907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyNmEwMWM1NzZmMCRhOWVjNmU0MCQxNTAyYThjMEBXb3JrR3JvdXA+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjAxMDMwMzE3LjQ5MS5xbWFpbEB3ZWI4MTkwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0MjlGNUUwMC4zMDAwMzAzQHNiY2dsb2JhbC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":106923,"prevInTime":106906,"nextInTime":106908,"topicId":106907,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Our Perpetual Recess thing is going to subscribe to some magazine Can you tell me more about your perpetual recess thing?
