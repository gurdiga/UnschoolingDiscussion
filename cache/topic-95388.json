Forty-two <br/>\n&gt; autodidacts gathered in the mountains of Oregon for a week of playing <br/>\n&gt; in the sun, brainstorming, sharing knowledge and ideas, and <br/>\n&gt; envisioning the future of self-education. Now, with two years under <br/>\n&gt; our belts, we are diving into the third annual Quo Vadis. This year&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; gathering takes place June 20th through June 26th at Camp<br/>\n&gt; Lane, just outside of Eugene, Oregon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you are a self-educator, autodidact, unschooler, homeschooler, life<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; long learner, or an average everyday Joe who thinks this all sounds <br/>\n&gt; fascinating, we would love to get an application from you! Call <br/>\n&gt; yourself what you like, but come to Quo Vadis to discuss, practice and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; experience education with others who see it as a lifelong process<br/>\n&gt; larger than schooling. We are an adult gathering, but we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t turn anyone away on the basis of age alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can find out more about Quo Vadis on our web site, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quovadis-gathering.org\">http://www.quovadis-gathering.org</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quovadis-gathering.org/\">http://www.quovadis-gathering.org/</a>&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or by emailing our<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; office:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:info@...\">info@...</a>.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hogwarts, was Re: What to Say?","postDate":"1086723599","msgId":95453,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhNTRtZitoZGZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNhNTBidCtzazJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95447,"nextInTopic":95509,"prevInTime":95452,"nextInTime":95454,"topicId":95388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ll let you know when I get <br/>\none or the other or both done. Basically, we just sat down and looked <br/>\nat what parts of the books would be fun to recreate, looked at what <br/>\nwe had available, and went from there. Diagon Alley has always been <br/>\nheld in someone&#39;s house. Different rooms were different &quot;shops&quot;. I <br/>\nhave always run the wand shop. I tried to think what would be a fun <br/>\nway to make wands, and ended up finding these clear plastic tubes at <br/>\na local plastics manufacturer. They come with end caps that you can <br/>\nfit on them. So then I got some &quot;phoenix feathers&quot;, &quot;unicorn <br/>\nhair&quot;, &quot;pixie dust&quot; and other supplies at the craft shop and when <br/>\nkids come to my wand shop they can select a wand and then fill it <br/>\nwith the magical artifacts that they desire. I even found enchanted <br/>\nglow-in-the dark pixie dust. Fun! You can really just use your <br/>\nimagination and create it the way you want to. The kids seem pretty <br/>\nwilling so suspend disbelief (even the older ones) and go along with <br/>\nit as long as you stay in character and be serious about the fact <br/>\nthat you would never *gasp* want to put a black phoenix feather in <br/>\nyour wand unless you worked for &lt;whisper&gt; you-know-who...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor classes, we did the same thing - potions classes were home <br/>\nchemistry (baking powder and vinegar experiments, rubber eggs, <br/>\nlevitating raisins, and other experiments you can find onlin). I did <br/>\nan herbology class where we planted wolfsbane, went into the field <br/>\nbehind our house and picked mint leaves and lemonbalm <br/>\nfor &quot;Dumbledore&#39;s favorite bedtime tea&quot;, etc. Another mom did a great <br/>\narithmancy class where she did a cool probability exercise. All the <br/>\nkids got a pair of dice each and she had a big chart on the wall with <br/>\n12 characters from Harry Potter, each character assigned to a number <br/>\nthat could be rolled with dice. The kids tried to predict which <br/>\ncharacter would win the race, then they all rolled the dice and she <br/>\nmoved each character once for each number each kid rolled (I think <br/>\nHarry Potter was 7, so for each child that rolled a 7, she moved <br/>\nHarry one spot). You could see the probability curve in action, with <br/>\nthe characters like Snape (who was 2) barely moving, and the <br/>\ncharacters who were more likely to be rolled moving more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few things we did, like I said, I&#39;m going to have to <br/>\nspend some time writing it all up. Each parent who taught a &quot;class&quot; <br/>\ncame up with their own way of doing it - from broom-making to <br/>\ndivination. We&#39;ve kept a light-hearted and fun tone and tried to <br/>\nstay &quot;in character&quot; as professors and make it as realistic as <br/>\npossible. For the quidditch match, I looked up &quot;Quidditch for <br/>\nmuggles&quot; online and got some good ideas, and then just worked with <br/>\nwhat I had. All in all, the kids have had a great time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1278341,"authorName":"Ann and Eric Yates","from":"&quot;Ann and Eric Yates&quot; &lt;hooperck@...&gt;","profile":"mumsienc2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Hogwarts, was Re: What to Say?","postDate":"1086708311","msgId":95509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZDIwMWM0NGQ2YyRjYjg5ZjgwMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBtb20+","referencesHeader":"PGNhNGtxcittZThyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95453,"nextInTopic":95511,"prevInTime":95508,"nextInTime":95510,"topicId":95388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve got to be the only people in the world that really didn t like Harry Potter!  lol I read it to the kids a long time ago.

I talk about clever scripting, casting of an attractive variety of <br/>\nkids, SMALL classes shown on TV, interesting teachers with interesting lines <br/>\nwritten for them (or comically silly teachers, with interesting comical lines).   <br/>\nI&#39;ve told Holly about Welcome Back, Kotter, where there were six or seven <br/>\nkids in the class, the teacher would invite them over to hang out, and one of <br/>\nthem was John Travolta.  Not very realistic for a typical, random special ed <br/>\nclass.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in reference to the earlier discussion(s) on advertising, my kids know <br/>\nthat Barney is one big school-propaganda campaign, and that when kids cannot go <br/>\nto school after hours without an adult around and play with puppets and <br/>\ncostumes and the coolest wooden toys and paints, and dance in the shaded, inviting <br/>\nplayground with a magic dinosaur.    Knowing that, watching that show (which <br/>\nhas good music a lot of times and had some great guest starts like Tomie <br/>\ndePaola) and then seeing the real playgrounds of schools around us which are two <br/>\nacres of hard dirt with plain steel equipment, and another couple of acres of <br/>\nsoccer-field grass, MAYBE if they&#39;re lucky, they know.  It&#39;s fantasy.  And they <br/>\nrarely see any kids on those playgrounds, but when they do it&#39;s a couple of <br/>\nhundred kids at once, and there are always a few facing the chain-link fence <br/>\nlooking sadly out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve played school a few times with kids.   Holly went three or four days <br/>\nonce of saying &quot;TIME FOR SCHOOL&quot; and setting up her &quot;desk&quot; and telling me I had <br/>\nto teach her now.  I would protest for the record, and then do something fun <br/>\nand then something boring.  The boring thing lasted her ten or fifteen minutes, <br/>\nand then I said it was recess and she never &quot;came back in,&quot; but would get <br/>\ndistracted playing and that was fine with me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI found the folder from that &quot;session&quot; last week, looking for something else. <br/>\n It had some drawings and some writing practice (loops and a row of &quot;c&quot; or <br/>\nsomething) and a math page from a workbook.   It said &quot;Duckford Elementary&quot; on <br/>\nthe outside. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was our school at home experience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":153142310,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;tri_mom@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hogwarts, was Re: What to Say?","postDate":"1086707355","msgId":95422,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhNGtxcittZThyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA2MDgyMDA0MTQzNy4xNTU0OS40MEM1Q0YzMjAwMEJCM0I2MDAwMDNDQkQyMjAwNzM0NzQ4MEUwMzBFMDMwMDA0MEFAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":95419,"nextInTopic":95423,"prevInTime":95421,"nextInTime":95423,"topicId":95388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... and talked about what it was that he wanted.

Orion has been bringing up going away to &quot;the big school&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; riding the school bus a lot recently.  I seems to be related to<br/>\n&gt; seeing shows or reading books, etc. where she sees kids going off to<br/>\n&gt; the wonderful place...and she wants to know when she will go.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have been responding by saying that some kids go away to school,<br/>\n&gt; but some kids are homeschooled.  We have said that we believe that<br/>\n&gt; kids learn all the time, and don&#39;t have to go away to school to<br/>\n&gt; learn.  We have acknowledged why it seems she is interested, &quot;you<br/>\n&gt; think it would be fun to ride the school bus&quot; or &quot;you think that it<br/>\n&gt; will be fun because you might get to play with the other kids&quot;.  We<br/>\n&gt; have casually explained that recess is only for a short time, and<br/>\n&gt; that the rest of the time, she would have to sit very quietly in a<br/>\n&gt; desk, and will not be allowed to talk much with the other kids.  We<br/>\n&gt; have said that we would miss her, and that she would be gone most of<br/>\n&gt; the day, and not able to be with the family doing fun things like<br/>\n&gt; ________.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tonight she said she wants &quot;to sit at a desk and listen to the<br/>\n&gt; teacher tell her to write in her book&quot;.  I said I would be glad to do<br/>\n&gt; that at home with her and she emphatically said &quot;NO&quot;.  I changed the<br/>\n&gt; subject and told her that I have been thinking that it might be fun<br/>\n&gt; for her to join a club called Girl Scouts...where she will meet with<br/>\n&gt; other girls, and have a book to write in.

But she was adamant about it. We&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscussed it off and on in the past couple of years, just answering <br/>\nher questions about school and what she could realistically expect if <br/>\nshe went. The desire to go has definitely waned. I think a large part <br/>\nof that was becoming part of an active homeschooling group. Now the <br/>\nkids that she sees on a regular basis - especially the older girls <br/>\nthat she adores - do not go to school. And she knows about all the <br/>\nfun activities she would miss out on and I think she has lost her <br/>\ndesire for it - at least she hasn&#39;t mentioned it in awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing that I discovered through all of this is that she does <br/>\ncrave structured activities and she really wants to be doing things <br/>\nindependently of me. When the summer camp catalog from a local nature <br/>\ngroup arrived in the mail, she wanted to sign up for every week&#39;s <br/>\ncamp. And for a long time, she talked about wanting to go to &quot;ballet <br/>\nschool&quot; (which comes from a book we read), so we signed her up for <br/>\nballet classes (which she insisted we call ballet *school*), she <br/>\nasked for violin lessons after watching the two female violin players <br/>\nin the Lord of the Dance DVD and she has been taking them now since <br/>\nshe was 3, and playing the violin every day. She&#39;s a hard taskmaster <br/>\non herself. She&#39;s going to play in a homeschool talent show this week <br/>\nand she chose her newest, hardest piece to play and is diligently <br/>\nattacking it in practice. It&#39;s a bit mind-boggling to see a 4 y.o. <br/>\nwho is so driven, but I&#39;m much this way myself so I just need to <br/>\naccept that this is who she is, and that this is how unschooling <br/>\nlooks for her - a more scheduled approach to learning, but one that <br/>\nis self-driven. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my point is that there are going to be kids who crave the <br/>\nkinds of things that school offers - structure, lessons, constant <br/>\npresence of other kids. The challenge in unschooling is to provide <br/>\nthem with enough of what they need. For extremely social kids in <br/>\nareas with little homeschool support, that can be pretty tough, and <br/>\nit might mean getting more involved in things like scouting or other <br/>\norganized groups (which you mentioned you said to her). Summer is a <br/>\ngood time to try out more schoolish things. A lot of working parents <br/>\nhave to have their kids in summer camps, so there are a lot more <br/>\ndaycamps offered than there used to be. Maybe there&#39;s a couple that <br/>\nshe&#39;d like to try, and she would get to see a little bit of what it <br/>\nentails - the routine of having to get there at 8:00 in the morning, <br/>\nfor instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: What to Say?","postDate":"1086701365","msgId":95407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhNGV2bCs3OXRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNhM2MzMSs4ZTAwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95400,"nextInTopic":95411,"prevInTime":95406,"nextInTime":95408,"topicId":95388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

After talking about it <br/>\nfor a few weeks and answering her questions she decided she didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally want to go.  From our talks, we figured out that she wanted <br/>\nmore friends and more structure so we talked about ways she could <br/>\nacheive those things.  She signed up for some classes and clubs to <br/>\nbroaden her base of friends and she came to me one day with a <br/>\nnotebook that looked so much like a teacher&#39;s planbook that I could <br/>\nhave sworn she&#39;d stolen it from a classroom somewhere.  She even had <br/>\na M-F schedule, a place for grades, &#39;due dates&#39;; the works.  For <br/>\nabout 4 days she kept that thing up faithfully, asked me how to <br/>\ncalculate grades, even scheduled in her lunch and break times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the fifth day, she had assigned herself a paper on &quot;a non-fiction <br/>\ntopic of her choice&quot;.  She chose to write a story about how she <br/>\nbecame interested in skateboarding.  The second week she had stopped <br/>\ndoing everything but her story writing and working in her Saxon math <br/>\nbook.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was about 6 months ago, give or take a couple of months.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t seen her do any textbook work aside from the Saxon math <br/>\nsince.  Although she may pick something else up here and there, she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t brought anything to me to see.  About once a month she brings <br/>\nme her Saxon work and asks me if I&#39;ll &quot;kind of&quot; check it to see if <br/>\nshe&#39;s getting it right.  I don&#39;t grab red pens or write anything.  <br/>\nIf I notice she&#39;s missed 5 or more in a row, or so, and I can see <br/>\nit&#39;s throwing her off, I&#39;ll point it out and she may or may not ask <br/>\nme to help her out.  Usually she resolves it herself and I don&#39;t see <br/>\nit for another few weeks or more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the skateboarding story?  She&#39;s been writing on it ever <br/>\nsince.  It is now taken up two spiral notebooks and part of a third. <br/>\nOnce the spirals started falling apart, she decided to type it in <br/>\nWord, which she had never used.  It took her a couple of days <br/>\ngoofing around in Word and using the help wizard guy and she was off <br/>\nwriting.  The grammar and spelling check irritated her so she <br/>\nfigured out how to turn those off.  (She told me she was tired of <br/>\nseeing red and green lines everywhere. lol)  So far she has typed 24 <br/>\npages in Word in a size 11 font.  WOW!   Not only is she writing a <br/>\ngreat story, but she has taught herself to use Word better than I <br/>\ncan, she types so fast it amazes me, she now uses the dictionary <br/>\nwhile she writes (guess the spell check gave her the hint...I didn&#39;t <br/>\neven have to fight my English-major urge) and has started <br/>\nresearching how to use graphics to illustrate and enhance it. The <br/>\nSaxon has stayed on because she is working on ramp and half-pipe <br/>\nplans alongside her story and needs the math to figure it all out.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI love that she hasn&#39;t erased all the spelling and grammar errors <br/>\nyet.  I copy and save the story in a separate file under my name <br/>\nbecause when she&#39;s done with it (if it ever will be done...it has <br/>\nbecome an ongoing diary of her skating and it&#39;s offshoots) and has <br/>\nmade all her corrections, if she does, I want to be able to look at <br/>\nit when I&#39;m 80 and get warm fuzzies remembering how this one story <br/>\nsparked so many learning and growing adventures for her.  I think <br/>\none of the coolest things about it is how much *I* am learning and <br/>\nlearning about her just by reading it!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I got a little side-tracked here. :)  Basically, I think <br/>\nonce kids are truly allowed to follow their own paths, they will <br/>\nrealize how much more they get out of unschooling, they&#39;ll go to <br/>\nschool and decide they want to come back home, or they&#39;ll go and <br/>\nwant to stay (though I think that&#39;s unlikely if they are given a <br/>\nrich environment to pursue their own dreams, fancies and <br/>\ncuriosities).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a lot of wonderful advice and other shared <br/>\nmoments that will inspire you and lead you to the right answers for <br/>\nyou and your family.  It wasn&#39;t easy for me to tell my daughter she <br/>\ncould go to school if she wanted to.  I have so many reasons why I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want her to go (and I was practically carrying a bucket to <br/>\ncollect the sweat) but in the end, she fgured it out all by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have our days when she mentions wanting to go but as soon <br/>\nas I say, OK, she is quick to tell me she doesn&#39;t REALLY want to and <br/>\nthen follows up with what is missing in life that she needs help or <br/>\nideas to fill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a little tidbit from her story I just have to share.

We have acknowledged why it seems she is interested, &quot;you <br/>\nthink it would be fun to ride the school bus&quot; or &quot;you think that it <br/>\nwill be fun because you might get to play with the other kids&quot;.  We <br/>\nhave casually explained that recess is only for a short time, and <br/>\nthat the rest of the time, she would have to sit very quietly in a <br/>\ndesk, and will not be allowed to talk much with the other kids.  We <br/>\nhave said that we would miss her, and that she would be gone most of <br/>\nthe day, and not able to be with the family doing fun things like <br/>\n________.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight she said she wants &quot;to sit at a desk and listen to the <br/>\nteacher tell her to write in her book&quot;.  I said I would be glad to do <br/>\nthat at home with her and she emphatically said &quot;NO&quot;.  I changed the <br/>\nsubject and told her that I have been thinking that it might be fun <br/>\nfor her to join a club called Girl Scouts...where she will meet with <br/>\nother girls, and have a book to write in.  She was excited and happy <br/>\nabout that and dropped the school talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow best to handle so she can feel right?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95596,"nextTopicId":95428}}
