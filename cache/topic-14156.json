From day one, they&#39;d walk right up to strangers and talk their<br/>\nears off and in some cases straighten them up if they made mistakes (heaven<br/>\nhelp the person that asked them &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school today, sweetie.&quot;).<br/>\nKidlets 2 and 5 were all about not wanting to have any outside contact until<br/>\nthey were much older and still weren&#39;t too comfortable with strangers at<br/>\nfirst.  Now, at the ripe old age of 16, kidlet #4 has suddenly turned<br/>\nshy-ish and kidlet #5 at age 12 is the next thing to a politician!<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-school or daycare or anything else wouldn&#39;t have made them more<br/>\n&quot;socialized.&quot;  These people need to get a life, OF THEIR OWN and live in the<br/>\nreal world.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 15, 2000 8:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: normal 3 year olds<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It is also normal for a three year old to cling to mother in an<br/>\n&gt; unfamiliar setting.
