He is a gray furry tiger with blue eyes. <br/>\nHe was named tiger after our old one.  He loves the fridge and has been <br/>\ntrapped in there once for a minute or so. The people that had him where feeding him <br/>\nmilk so he knows where to get the grub. He is very sweet. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe drives the youngest Brittany nuts, Tucker wants that kitty so bad. He has <br/>\ngotten to him once but just jumped around and batted him but he is much <br/>\nheavier than the kitten.  Though Nicholas 15mo pucks him up side down, by a foot you <br/>\nname it. Tiger comes back for more though. Usually Nick carries the kitten to <br/>\nme. He loves the kitten, we all do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n3 dogs, 3 cats , 3 kids, 1 bunny and a baby one the way.
