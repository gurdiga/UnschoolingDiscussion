I have been reading the list for many months because I <br/>\nwanted to see what it is all about before jumping in. I have learned <br/>\nso much from all of you as I am always still learning and tempering<br/>\nmy <br/>\nway of living/teaching our children. My name is Elisabeth and I live <br/>\nin California. We have been living the hs lifestyle for about 13<br/>\nyears <br/>\nnow. We have 5 wonderful ( aren&#39;t they all?!) children who have never <br/>\nbeen to school due to the new things we were introduced to when we <br/>\nattended a hs conference when our oldest was only 6 months old, then <br/>\nread the Moore&#39;s books over and over again and hung out with <br/>\n&quot;experienced &quot; homeschool families at Park days during the toddler/ <br/>\nearly elementary years.<br/>\nJust recently I listened to some tapes that a friend loaned me from a <br/>\nconference that the Moore&#39;s gave in the early 90&#39;s. I found this to<br/>\nbe <br/>\nso helpful. Have any of you read their books? Have many of you <br/>\nfollowed their outline of the Moore Formula? What are your <br/>\nexperiences?<br/>\nYou&#39;d think that by now I&#39;d have it all figured out but not so as it <br/>\nis taking me a long time to unlearn the things that I learned about<br/>\nhs <br/>\nearly on from the Protestant-type hs. Yes, My son and I suffered <br/>\nthrough using Rod and Staff one year- it was awful!!!!! Then we tried <br/>\nSonlight, this was much nicer but too scheduled to really work in our <br/>\nlife (the books were great!) Well, it has been about four years now <br/>\nand we are finally starting to come to a place where we are all <br/>\ncomfortable and doing what we need to be doing. One of the most <br/>\nimportant things I have seen and learned is this:Negative Peer <br/>\npressure whether it is youthful or in adult frienships is not healthy <br/>\nfor the development of healthy families/people/little people.<br/>\nI look forward to taking part in the list.<br/>\nBlessings,Elisabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9947,"nextTopicId":10015}}
