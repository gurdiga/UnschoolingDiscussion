I always admired my aunt&#39;s family<br/>\n(8 kids on a farm) because it seemed like they all pitched in and did what<br/>\nneeded to be done and enjoyed doing it.  That was a child&#39;s perspective, of<br/>\ncourse, and they may have gotten along better with company around and it may<br/>\nhave been more structured than it appeared to my child&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister has 3 kids and she has charts and points and rewards and she has<br/>\nto keep upping the points earned and the points neccessary to receive<br/>\nthings.  (Did that make sense?)  The usual rewards are Beanie Babies and<br/>\nbefore long they either don&#39;t have a Beanie that they really want or they<br/>\njust don&#39;t want to do the jobs - so they don&#39;t.  This has escalted to the<br/>\npoint that they now get 500 pts a day if they keep their rooms &quot;reasonably&quot;<br/>\npicked up - meaning if you can&#39;t see the mess from the doorway!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you never know how life will turn out BUT - IMHO - your kids will<br/>\ngrow up to be well adjusted adults who know how to share space and<br/>\nresponsibilities.
