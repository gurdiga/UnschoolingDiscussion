A<br/>\nthorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>\nexperience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>\nexperiences and some theology.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, more specialized areas will arise in every persons education,<br/>\ndependent upon their individual or family tastes and interests, and there<br/>\nare far too many fields to go into here.

Email can be hard at times,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;since we are doing without tones of voices and body language.

I&#39;d love to.  You may be sorry you asked! <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I would love to see a permanent listing (perhaps on the Web site?) with all<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the pertinent information about each list member, such as: geographic<br/>\n&gt; location, ages/genders of children, interests, hobbies, and/or anything<br/>\n&gt; else that might prove useful.  While it is lovely to have folks include<br/>\n&gt; this information in their intro messages, I find I cannot remember all of<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it, or who matches which information.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Onelist has a great number of accessories we can use.  Many people are <br/>\n&gt;careful about the kind of information that is posted, but everything here <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;would be limited to just the people on this list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;I<br/>\n&gt; How about the idea of swapping or timesharing or just plain sharing lodging<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; for travel purposes?  I think travel is a wonderful aspect made possible by<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; the freedom from madated school schedules that homeschooling, and<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling in particular, provide.  We have a 2,000 sq. ft. home with a<br/>\n&gt; couple of extra bedrooms and/or couch space and we happen to live within an<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; hour of Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks!  Anyone interested in group<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; trips, get togethers, summer cookouts, or anything else of that nature in<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Idaho or the surrounding area?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This is so much fun! Over the years I&#39;ve gotten together with a great number<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;of online friends. Matter of fact I spent 8 days of May in ABQ New Mexico <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;with an online friend.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Le&#39;ts define education then.. what do you see them doing in order to <br/>\n&gt;*become <br/>\n&gt; &gt;educated*?<br/>\n&gt; Boy!  That&#39;s a tall order! <br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;need to have good reading, writing and math<br/>\n&gt; skills.  That includes the ability to function well in the world with daily<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; math skills, being able to communicate their thoughts articulately and in<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; an intelligent manner in writing, and being able to read anything<br/>\n&gt; non-technical (and some things that are) that interest them without feeling<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; unable to comprehend or decipher it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We could talk for hours about what constitues *good* and *fuction well*. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt;Most of what you write I hope happens for my children. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;It is also important for them to have an understanding of the sciences;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Biology, Chemistry, Environmental, Astrological, etc... and how they affect<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; their daily lives and the world at large.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well, I love knowing the things I know, but there are a great many people <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;living wonderful, full, productive lives who have not one factiod about <br/>\n&gt;chemistry stored in their brain..... that is stored as *chemistry* .  :) <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt;They should have a pretty good<br/>\n&gt; idea what the history of our Nation and the world are, both celebrated and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; shameful events/circumstances. They should understand how ours, and maybe<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; some other major political systems operate, and their place in them. They<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; will need a woking knowledge of computers and their trappings as well.  A<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; thorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>\n&gt; experience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>\n&gt; experiences and some theology. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I would agree that these things are important, but I&#39;m not sure that each and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;every person needs to touch on these things in order to be *educated*.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;.  Also remember, this is the<br/>\n&gt; opinion of a single, fallible individual, and I may be leaving something<br/>\n&gt; out. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We all leave something out!! I have no interest in knowing so many things.<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt;Ancient Chinese History just holds nothing for me...... but to another it <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;could be life changing.  Now ask me about babies, midwifery, unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;some theology, politics....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; What a wonderfully generous offer, Thank you!
