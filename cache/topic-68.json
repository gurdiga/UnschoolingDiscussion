I could cry right now for <br/>\neverything the public school system put him through (unfortunately, call me <br/>\nnaive, but I never heard of homeschooling before he was in 6th grade, and <br/>\nthen it took me a year to get up the nerve, and 6 months to talk my dh into <br/>\nit).<br/>\n     Anyway, my other children have really blossomed from unschooling, <br/>\nespecially my 7 yod, who has never gone to public school.  My 10 yos is a <br/>\nlittle more laid back, and sometimes likes doing workbooks (yuck!), and my 13 <br/>\nyos is constantly finding something new to get involved in, just like all the <br/>\nstories I read in GWS and Home Education magazines (photography, cooking, <br/>\nvideo making, history books, you name it).  My 17 yos, however, doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally want to do anything.  He hates anything remotely connected to <br/>\nschoolwork, so I try to relax with him, but since he is getting so old (and <br/>\nmy ps teacher parents keep pushing) I am getting worried about him and his <br/>\nfuture.  I have tried every type of Algebra book that I can find (public <br/>\nschool books, Abeka, Saxon, and Principles From Patterns by Making Math <br/>\nMeaningful), and in the two years of &quot;high school&quot; that he has done at home, <br/>\nhe has not yet finished even 1/2 of any algebra book.<br/>\n     I get concerned and try to &quot;do school&quot; with him, but we both get <br/>\nfrustrated and it feels like no-one is really learning anything--like we are <br/>\njust forcing things.  He gets entirely frustrated with me, so once again I <br/>\nlay off, but then all he wants to do is read Star Wars books, Robert Jordan <br/>\nbooks, play nintendo 64, or play on the internet.  I keep wondering when he <br/>\nwill finally be &quot;deschooled&quot; and ready to learn.  He has been out of school <br/>\nfor 3 1/2 years, isn&#39;t that long enough?  I know that he had a very <br/>\nemotionally bad time at public school, and I am trying to understand him, but <br/>\nhe just doesn&#39;t seem to want to do anything productive. <br/>\n     I don&#39;t really know anyone who unschools here, like I said this is a <br/>\nvery structured school-at-home homeschool group here.  I do have some more <br/>\n&quot;relaxed&quot; friends that I met from doing KONOS, although they don&#39;t quite <br/>\nunschool, but even they are telling me that he needs to do structured <br/>\nschooling since he is in high school (all of them have smaller children), and <br/>\nthat he won&#39;t be very disciplined in his character if I don&#39;t make him be <br/>\nmore structured.  They say that I am allowing him to be lazy.  Needless to <br/>\nsay, this all concerns me deeply.  I sure don&#39;t want to be hurting my son.  I <br/>\nwould hate to look back years later, and think that he is not getting a job, <br/>\nor he is living at home and not working, just because I allowed him freedom <br/>\nto unschool during his teen years.<br/>\n     Is there anyone else who is dealing with an unmotivated teenager?  What <br/>\ndo I need to do?  Should I back off and give him freedom or should I give him <br/>\nmore structure?<br/>\nTami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Pinderscmb@xxx.xxx","from":"Pinderscmb@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"JHcUFVByxtQDIG5CkOiBzy1FrkjLIlDGolU8XnC-kp6svWeb6zwF-XGMJqHxtUgTYIW_0B0POjEp","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New to list with real important questions!","postDate":"928374299","msgId":185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOS4xODUuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":175,"nextInTopic":192,"prevInTime":184,"nextInTime":186,"topicId":68,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/1/1999 10:13:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time, APPLEKJF@AOL.COM writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1792117272\">In a message dated 6/1/1999 10:13:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:APPLEKJF@...\">APPLEKJF@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; All those books on the shelf <br/>\n that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep <br/>\n dusting?!  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a while to deschool the kids after you pull them out.

I realized from a hsing seminar that by this age<br/>\nhe will be just starting to repeat everything learned in elementary years<br/>\nwaiting for high school to start. So with that in mind I let my now 11 yos<br/>\nunschool. It was amazing. He went from being told that he was ADD and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t amount to much from the school because he would tune them out,or<br/>\nbecause his art work was messy, or ....<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, he volunteered at a local retail store, waited on customers<br/>\n(including operating the cash register which he loved), then he found<br/>\nhimself a job delivering papers. With a weekly paycheck he does his own<br/>\nbanking/spending/saving which helped the math alot. He then doubled his<br/>\nroute size, at the same time he made friends with a recluse in the<br/>\nneighborhood who watched over him as he learned how to build computers. He<br/>\ninvested in a better computer, having installment payments, had to read<br/>\nsome manuals for installation, and reads cover to cover his computer<br/>\nshopper catalogs. He&#39;s dealing with customers daily, and just got a call<br/>\ntonight that he is going to be the areas carrier of the week for next week.<br/>\n He still likes to be read to rather than read books, but he will sit down<br/>\nand read somethings. He says he can&#39;t do decimals, but can handle money and<br/>\ncalculate taxes in his head (but he says that&#39;s different.lol). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also traveled quite a bit, his favorite thing is to plan our routes<br/>\nand try to get us to go through larger cities so he can find all the sports<br/>\nareanas. Try getting him lost on a road trip, we always avoid the highways<br/>\nfor the scenic route and have needed him to adjust for road constructions too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess I went on long enough, but the point is that allowing him to find his<br/>\nown interests will allow what he does learn to stay with him much longer<br/>\nthan the things we memorized then immediately forgot after the test. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even realize how much he is learning each day. Every now and then<br/>\nhe will ask how many days he has logged for school, when I tell him he is<br/>\nvery surprised. He sometimes will read through his log when the realization<br/>\nof how much he learned sinks in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Soon school transcripts and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;records for college will come into play, how do I manage this if I am truly <br/>\n&gt;unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My oldest son 14, just completed his evaluation for 9th grade. He was<br/>\ncredited with 7.5 credits towards graduation! but on the way to the<br/>\nevaluation,he asked me how he was going to pass this year as he really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do anything. When the evaluator looked at all of the stuff in his<br/>\nportfolio, he remarked to my son that he was glad I wasn&#39;t his mother as<br/>\nI&#39;d wear him out with all the stuff we do. My son burst out laughing<br/>\nremembering our conversation in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that it would seem almost impossible not to complete what is<br/>\nrequired for high school through just living. A teen tends to get something<br/>\nin his/her head and must figure it out. One good example of this from this<br/>\nyear was: My son and I listened to a newsprogram which mentioned the<br/>\nJapanese banking crisis.  He asked why they didn&#39;t just print more money,<br/>\nso we began an indepth conversation on banking/economics etc. That wasn&#39;t<br/>\ngood enough so he dug out his _Whatever happened to Penny cAndy_ and while<br/>\nI was running a couple of errands had pretty much what he needed. He then<br/>\nwrote up a paper to convince me how Japan could fix their problems. It was<br/>\nvery thought out, and while I don&#39;t agree with all of his plan, we have<br/>\neconomists arguing the situation so he&#39;s in good company.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have noticed that my boys backslide, lose the knowledge they <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;previously displayed, when we slack off and become more informal.  This <br/>\n&gt;concerns me greatly, can anyone help me with this????  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What kind of knowledge?  If the knowledge they are forgetting are things<br/>\nlike grammar rules or dates or something like that, then its something that<br/>\nthey don&#39;t feel a need for now. OTOH, I bet they can rattle off batting<br/>\naverages or whatever their passion is. When it comes to grammar, I&#39;d be<br/>\nmore concerned about how they write than if they know all the rules.<br/>\nLearning doesn&#39;t consist of just those things that can be measured, if you<br/>\nwatch you will notice that they are absorbing so much more but it may not<br/>\nfit nicely into school subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n When the children are <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;doing close to nothing (usually not a problem with Justin), for quite some <br/>\n&gt;time, how do you manage that at my boys&#39; ages?

What kinds of books do you have on the shelf?<br/>\nDid you pick them out or did they? I found that for my youngest who doesnt&#39;<br/>\ncare much to read, that I&#39;d picked out all kinds of books that *I* thought<br/>\nhe&#39;d like. But he didn&#39;t have much input into the ones that were choosen.<br/>\nSo one day I decided to institute a &quot;school allowance&quot;. Because we unschool<br/>\nthere are so many things that fit as educational. ONce my son had a set<br/>\namount that he could spend on school things he started to mention all kinds<br/>\nof things he wanted. Out went the boredom, and he even bought some books,<br/>\nmost were Wishbone mysteries or classics, but he bought books and the<br/>\nclassics added up to Literature class!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarassing in fact.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I truly need the help and advice of &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers who have had <br/>\n&gt;several years under their belts watching their children grow and trusting <br/>\n&gt;their children. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hope I was of help, this is only our second year home from the ps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I want to somewhat settle into a way of living where I am <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;not constantly second guessing myself, irritating my children, feeling <br/>\n&gt;totally inadequate, and spending way too much money on things that don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt;belong in my home!

I love books,so one of my best finds this year was<br/>\nPeter Mendels&#39; _Material World_. I got it from the library and left it set<br/>\non the table. No one touched it, so later that night I set down with it.<br/>\nBefore long one son arrived to find out what was so interesting. I showed<br/>\nhim how the book was arranged and he asked if he could see it. I told him<br/>\nhe could later, so he tried to pull the guilt trip that this was school and<br/>\nI should let him see it. After a little while enjoying this I gave it to<br/>\nhim. The next day son number 2 wanted to know why we were &quot;fighting&quot; over a<br/>\nbook. After a while he asked if he could see it. This went on for so long<br/>\nthat I had to renew it a couple of times.  You can do this with almost<br/>\nanything. Right now is planting season here, so I pulled out a seed<br/>\ncatalog, it didn&#39;t take long before each child had a list of edible plants<br/>\nthey wanted to grow and each choose an area in the yard for their garden.<br/>\nSo now we are getting our gardens in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am looking forward to networking with you all and hearing your advice on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;matters of concern.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It will all work out.

She lost interest in dance, and after 5 years of <br/>\nbeing passionate about it, this came as a shock!  I decided to stop doing <br/>\nanything and let her be.  That worked for about 3 months and then I started <br/>\ngetting antsy that I wasn&#39;t doing anything so I started pulling together <br/>\n&quot;lessons&quot;.  We&#39;d read a little history....boring.  We&#39;d look at some websites <br/>\ntogether....boring.  We&#39;d do some Math....boring.  Hmmmmm.  Still not <br/>\nworking.  More time off to deschool.<br/>\n\tThat&#39;s when I noticed an interesting thing happening.  Mary would ask <br/>\nto use the computer and spend HOURS writing on the word processor.  Then she <br/>\nasked how to use the publishing program so she could publish books.  Then she <br/>\nstarted asking if we could play a Math game.  (We use Family Math).  Then she <br/>\nstarted pulling out various Art supplies and leaving them laying around all <br/>\nthe time.  Then she asked if we could do something in her Chemistry set.  It <br/>\ngoes on and on, but you get the idea.  Right now we&#39;re in a bit of a slump <br/>\nand I chalk it up to the end of the &quot;school year&quot;.  <br/>\n\tWe have plans for the summer that include performing in children&#39;s <br/>\ntheater, piano lessons, making a small quilt, using the solar oven Mary <br/>\nbuilt, learning how to run a small business (mine), and trying to get more <br/>\nexercise.  Next year, or whenever, we plan on doing lots more Art, utilizing <br/>\nmentors in our community.  We&#39;ve decided to abandon dance for awhile and <br/>\npursue piano in its place.  We&#39;ll see how our new, more relaxed stance plays <br/>\nout.  I envision a happier family.<br/>\n\tThanks for listening, and thanks for this list!<br/>\nJudy in CA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nn a message dated 6/1/99 7:12:54 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:APPLEKJF@...\">APPLEKJF@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Mainly because I keep <br/>\n&gt;  falling into the &quot;school at home trap&quot;.

Isn&#39;t it terrible what p.s. <br/>\ndoes to our minds?! I read that for every year in ps, that&#39;s how many years <br/>\nit takes to de-school.<br/>\nI really think that school is evil. They tell you what to do, when to do it, <br/>\nhow to do it,<br/>\nand God-forbid if you don&#39;t do it &quot;right&quot;. It&#39;s no wonder that when we pull <br/>\nour children out and &quot;unschool&quot; them, they don&#39;t know what to do with <br/>\nthemselves! <br/>\nThink about everything a child learns in the first few years of their life. <br/>\nWalking, talking, feeding themselves, learning how to dress themselves, <br/>\nlearning how to use the bathroom. I mean, when you think about it, it&#39;s <br/>\nreally quite unbelievable! And all this is done without teachers and schools. <br/>\nChildren are self-taught. And then when they&#39;re 5, we put them in school so <br/>\nthey can LEARN? Sheesh!!<br/>\nSorry. I get carried away. I have a 16 y.o. and a 14 y.o. and they probably <br/>\nwon&#39;t be done de-schooling till they leave home. I&#39;ve only been <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling a little over a year. My 8 y.o. won&#39;t write. <br/>\nGetting her to write a thank-you note is a big ordeal. I don&#39;t push it <br/>\nanymore. 2 nights ago, as I was dozing on the couch, she decides to write her <br/>\nDad a note, asking him for money, so she could get ice-cream the next day. <br/>\nThe only word she asked for help was &quot;please&quot;. She made the &quot;2&quot; backwards, <br/>\nbut I figured, in time, she&#39;ll figure it out. Anyway, the point is, she felt <br/>\na need to write, and she did! (BTW, I dated it and put it in her file so we <br/>\ncan show it to the certified teacher next year. LOL.) Mostly, she just plays. <br/>\nAs for college, I personally, have never read this book, but it&#39;s supposed to <br/>\nbe really good. It&#39; called, &quot;What about College?&quot; by Cafi Cohen. If the <br/>\nlibrary doesn&#39;t have it, ask them to order it. Also, &quot;The Homeschooling Book <br/>\nof Answers&quot; by Linda Dobson.<br/>\nIt is a spectacular book. Also, &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to Use the <br/>\nWhole World as your Child&#39;s Classroom&quot; by Mary Griffith.(equally <br/>\nspectacular!) Read something positive about unschooling everyday. It will <br/>\nhelp. <br/>\nI know it&#39;s hard. I see children the same age as my 8 y.o. who are learning <br/>\ncursive and their  multiplication tables. My 8 y.o. is still working on <br/>\nprinting and addition.<br/>\nJust give them time to de-school and they&#39;ll come around. It&#39;s a humans <br/>\nnature to learn. They will surprise you.<br/>\nHang in there!<br/>\nMary Ellen.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Mowery Family","from":"&quot;Mowery Family&quot; &lt;jkkddmowery@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"bZujDiWL_AL-few65Vf1ywrkiN6JXXmmafztHnBFiwbg-h-YsF9Cudb290OJJPSse-cAq0TnWPJ7B5xj_HUued9A8Ju2hectO5I_co5VD5I3PGQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: New to list with real important questions!","postDate":"928321562","msgId":101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNS4xMDEuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89,"nextInTopic":170,"prevInTime":100,"nextInTime":102,"topicId":68,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... is it wise to unschool him at this point?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1100467361\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;On to my questions...
