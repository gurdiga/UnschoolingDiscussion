I know that he has not read the first article about it, or spoken with anyone that does homeschool.  Part of my help came from the fact that our families are SO against homeschooling.  For some reason, &#39;defying&#39; our family was a big attraction for him...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother point in my favor was when I got the list of &quot;what your kindergartener needs to know to get to first grade&quot;.  Even by the age of 3, our oldest had all of it but the ability to recognize and express rhyming words.  At some point last year, he began spouting off ragged poetry and we both looked at each other and said, &quot;Well, I guess kindergarten is done...&quot;  There was a peace about knowing the approach we were using was letting him really enjoy learning AND keeping him above &#39;grade level&#39;.  (I know this is a sore topic with unschooling, but anyone who has to &#39;prove&#39; themselves to a spouse or other person to get support from them has to resort to such tactics at times.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last big point in my favor came rather recently when I suggested I teach the kids on Thursday and Friday and he can take over for Saturday and Sunday.  They are still quite young and I don&#39;t totally unschool yet, plus we have to account for our time with the cover school.   I enjoy very much directing their attention to various subjects, talking with them and sharing new things.  I follow their interests and do as much as I can to help them explore and learn.  I tend to lean toward more reading and making (sculpting, drawing, painting) and I love nature studies and sciences.  My husband is very musical, tends to be much more physical and loves to find out how and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the prospect for being responsible for 1/2 of their &#39;school week&#39; hit him, he became very quiet and I could HEAR the wheels clicking in his brain.  He suddenly came up with several suggestions, started reading a borrowed copy of a Charlotte Mason guide and his whole outlook changed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think what may have to happen for your friend is that she will have to talk to her husband about what is best for their children, NOT what some outsider-no matter how respected he is-thinks is best.  She will have plenty of facts to support her, I suggest she joins a local support group to get some &#39;physical&#39; backing and proof that the kids will not become social outcasts and that homeschooled kids are normal (even if they are freakishly friendly and polite).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe she could find a way for him to get involved.  She could point out the benefiets HE would get -vacation any time anywhere without worrying about school schedules.  Much less illness without a child bringing in every version of the latest virus home.  Less hassle with clothing, no worries about what is in style or school dress codes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty more, but she will have to read his cues about what he wants to hear.  I have no doubt her children&#39;s progress will destroy any doubts he is having and they will be homeschooling from now on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEsther<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Homeschool4us123@aol.com","from":"Homeschool4us123@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"T32Ct9641x3w-VIR2uQkNKImKpyVAOw0L_gQ1IlKMjeDYILDMlL8Pxv5_A7JmO-qMa77eQ98f1uPWrRx9JIM","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Father is anti-homeschooling","postDate":"998891204","msgId":23691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjE5ZGE5NmY1LjI4YmIzOGM0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23695,"prevInTime":23690,"nextInTime":23692,"topicId":23691,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry if I am on more then one list as some of you and you ve recieved this twice!
