It&#39;s my own pursuit of learning as an adult that <br/>\nhas caused me to put on the brakes about traditional learning in <br/>\nschools. I found myself expecting of my kids what I know doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwork at all with me. That&#39;s how I got here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy urging moms to get invested in developing their own <br/>\npassions and interests, by expanding their thoughts and <br/>\nexperiences, we give them a model that comes from inside... <br/>\nand it&#39;s that that drove me to this list again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this morning, my dh and I took the five out for breakfast and <br/>\ntalked about our best years of &quot;homeschool.&quot; The kids all quickly <br/>\nrecalled the years where I was hands-off and where they had <br/>\nfree reign of their learning (unschooling). I have undulated in <br/>\nhow  free I&#39;ve been due to lack of support and the encroaching <br/>\nfears related to college. But today, both my dh and I felt free from <br/>\nthose fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe shared with the kids that we were going to go back to that <br/>\nway of learning only this time without fear. I used my personal <br/>\nexperience of studying art, U2, Hans Kung and African violet care <br/>\nas examples of how my education has blossomed without <br/>\nstructure or accountability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree of the five really caught fire. The other two (my pleasers) <br/>\nboth immediately felt that the freedom was too great and worry <br/>\nthat they will not meet requirements if left to themselves. Wow. <br/>\nHumbling to think I had already damaged their sense of <br/>\npersonal responbility and self-trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, thank you for all the help yesterday. We&#39;ve jumped. <br/>\nAnd my husband is fully on board. In fact, he kept saying last <br/>\nnight (into the wee hours) &quot;I don&#39;t want our kids to be brain dead <br/>\nlike all the freshmen I teach in college.&quot; He has weekly proof that <br/>\njust because kids are prepared for college doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>\nare learning anything or even want to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, for those who are interested, a friend and I started a website <br/>\nfor women who want to talk about art, books, movies, and <br/>\nanything else they are learning. It started out predominantly with <br/>\nChristian homeschoolers, but we&#39;ve broadened some and are <br/>\neager for all kinds of women to join us. The forum is <br/>\nnon-sectarian and the emphasis is on the humanities not <br/>\nreligion. We are just over 200 users now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.trapdoorsociety.com\">http://www.trapdoorsociety.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Wende","postDate":"1041873756","msgId":53344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyLjJiMzVjMzBjLjJiNGIxNTVjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":53329,"nextInTopic":53370,"prevInTime":53343,"nextInTime":53345,"topicId":53329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/6/03 8:38:34 AM, starsuncloud@cs.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1095540875\">In a message dated 1/6/03 8:38:34 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Anyhoo, sometimes focusing on yourself can be a good way to get <br/>\nunschooling <br/>\noff the ground so to speak. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a really hard thing to tell new unschoolers, too, who are all <br/>\nfrightened and anxious.  &quot;Ignore your kids a while, and just do what YOU want <br/>\nto do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t instil confidence, and makes them think we&#39;re nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I write about deschooling, though, I try to make it things parents and <br/>\nkids do together, hoping that somewhere in there the parents will have <br/>\nlightbulb moments while they think they&#39;re doing something to/for their <br/>\nchild.
