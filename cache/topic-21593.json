Having done the<br/>\nbulk of raising and educating myself, I would never<br/>\nhave entrusted institutions and &quot;authorities&quot; with my<br/>\nchild.  I knew I would have children one day, as I<br/>\nloved them too much to not have any.  I also knew I<br/>\nwould not send them to public school, that I had such<br/>\nhorrible experiences with.  I knew I was not likely to<br/>\nfind a private school that I was comfortable with, and<br/>\ndid not like the institutional mentality anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I did finally get preganat, it had been decided<br/>\nin my mind for years that I would homeschool my kids<br/>\nand I matter of factly let everyone know that.  Later<br/>\non, when we discovered all our elder sons special<br/>\nneeds and allergies as he grew, friends and family<br/>\nalike began to assume we had decided to homeschool<br/>\nbecause of him.  Sometimes I correct them, other times<br/>\nnot.  I really don&#39;t care why they think we do it,<br/>\njust so long as they leave us to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a cousin who homeschooled all four of her<br/>\nchildren when I was growing up, but they are<br/>\nfundamentalist Christian and do school at home with<br/>\nstrict religious curriculum.  When I first was letting<br/>\nfolks know that we planned on homeschooling ours, that<br/>\nside of the family said &quot;Oh, you should talk to your<br/>\ncousin Renee.  She homeschools all her kids!&quot;  It<br/>\nseems like they think it must be hard to find out<br/>\nabout homeschooling and I would need to talk to her to<br/>\nfind things out.  They assume that because they are<br/>\nignorant and don&#39;t hear anything much about it, or<br/>\nknow how to find out about it, that I must not either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow I found my way to Homeschooling naturally, long<br/>\nbefore I had kids.  Unschooling came after I had the<br/>\nkids and began to do serious research about the<br/>\nlegalities and logistics of homeschooling.  I educated<br/>\nmyself about the different methods and theories and<br/>\nUnschooling was a natural fit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is like a male shadow self of me.  What I<br/>\nwould have been had I been raised by a loving family<br/>\nin a small town (and been born male!)  LOL  So we<br/>\nagree on nearly everything, and he is behind me all<br/>\nthe way with the unschooling, as with everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
