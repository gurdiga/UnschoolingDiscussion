I don&#39;t belong to that<br/>\ngroup; I belong to a small group of about 15 families<br/>\nwith maybe 7 families who participate on a very<br/>\nregular basis. This group started out as a group of<br/>\nmoms who wanted to nurse, homebirth, avoid vaccines<br/>\n(some of them) and homestead (some of them). When the<br/>\nkids reached schoolage, it evolved into a<br/>\nhomeschooling group. Some of the members ended up<br/>\nsending their kids to school and quitting the group,<br/>\nand new members joined. I&#39;m one of the newest members;<br/>\nI&#39;ve been with them about a year and a half. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Christian group has big events, events they rent<br/>\narenas for and so forth, and they&#39;re really friendly<br/>\nabout letting other homeschoolers participate in those<br/>\nevents. I know homeschoolers who belong to no group at<br/>\nall. But other than my small group and the big<br/>\nChristian group, I don&#39;t know of any other groups in<br/>\nmy area. I live in Marquette, on Lake Superior, which<br/>\nis a college town of about 25,000, surrounded by vast<br/>\nforests and pockets of tiny towns.

We&#39;ll give<br/>\nthat a try. Juli<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Don&#39;t worry about us new people raising our<br/>\neyebrows at the porn comments. Another egroup I belong<br/>\nto was talking for days and days about the most<br/>\nunusual places they ever had sex (I refrained from<br/>\ncommenting). This was sparked by someone mentioning<br/>\nseeing some poor giraffes at the zoo trying to have<br/>\nsex with tons of people watching. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
