JOSEF HEBERT <br/>\n<br/>\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Addressing the most troubling issue facing the nuclear <br/>\nindustry, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Thursday chose Yucca <br/>\nMountain in Nevada to be the nation&#39;s burial site for thousands of tons <br/>\nof nuclear waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham concluded the site 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas was <br/>\n&quot;scientifically sound and suitable&quot; as a repository for highly <br/>\nradioactive used reactor fuel now kept at commercial reactors in 31 <br/>\nstates, a department spokesman said.<br/>\n<br/>\nA final administration decision will be up to President Bush, who has <br/>\nchampioned the need for a central disposal site for the waste and is <br/>\nexpected to seek a federal license for the site in the coming months.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The secretary made his decision on sound science,&quot; said Energy <br/>\nDepartment spokesman Joe Davis.<br/>\n<br/>\nNevada officials, who have fought the proposed dump for more than a <br/>\ndecade, have vowed to use every means available to keep the waste out of <br/>\nthe state. They argue that despite 13 years of intense scientific study <br/>\nthe federal government has not adequately shown that the public can be <br/>\nprotected from future radiation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham, in notifying Nevada&#39;s governor of the decision, said &quot;sound <br/>\nscience and compelling national interests&quot; as well as growing concern <br/>\nabout nuclear materials since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks require <br/>\nwastes to be consolidated at a central site.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are compelling national interests that require us to complete the <br/>\nsiting process and move forward with the development of a (waste) <br/>\nrepository,&quot; Abraham wrote Nevada Gov. Kenneth Guinn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier in the day White House adviser Karl Rove telephoned Guinn, a <br/>\nRepublican and strong opponent of the Yucca project, to attempt to soften <br/>\nthe political concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even a presidential decision is not expected to end the bitter debate <br/>\nover siting of a national waste dump. The final word probably will come <br/>\nfrom Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder a 1982 law, which directed the government to assume responsibility <br/>\nfor the commercial nuclear industry&#39;s highly radioactive waste, only <br/>\nCongress can override the expected Nevada veto.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site, which still faces a myriad of legal challenges from Nevada, is <br/>\nnot expected to be ready to accept waste until 2010 at the earliest. The <br/>\nNuclear Regulatory Commission also must issue a license, a process that <br/>\ncould take several years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe government has spent $6.8 billion to study the Nevada site since <br/>\n1983. After reviewing three sites, Congress settled on Yucca Mountain in <br/>\n1987 as the only location to be pursued.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Nevada site is a mountain of volcanic rock formed 13 million years <br/>\nago. For nearly two decades, scientists have worked to determine whether <br/>\nits geology, volcanic history and hydrology are suitable for storing <br/>\nmaterials that will remain dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands <br/>\nof years.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower utilities have promoted the Yucca Mountain site as the most secure <br/>\nand safest place to put the used reactor fuel now kept at reactor sites. <br/>\nMore than 40,000 tons of wastes already have built up at the plants with <br/>\n2,000 tons added each year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe site, if finally approved and licensed, is expected to hold up to <br/>\n77,000 tons of waste, buried in a labyrinth of bunkers 900 feet beneath <br/>\nthe surface.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30993,"nextTopicId":30986}}
