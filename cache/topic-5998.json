They have entire courses on it. I<br/>\ntook  a short  general one for ps teachers who were training at Sunbridge<br/>\nCollege the Waldorf college in NY a few years ago and although as an adult I<br/>\nstunk at it as I have not been comfortable with my body for a long time!<br/>\nKids really do learn a lot and can retain even more from rhythmical games<br/>\netc. They call it Eurythmy. Can anyone tell more about this here? I enjoyed<br/>\nfollowing but not comfortable leading as I march to the beat of a different<br/>\ndrum and my memory doesn&#39;t seem attached to my body anymore. Yes there are a<br/>\nfew cool  ps out there that do teach Waldorf style. It is still teacher<br/>\ndirected though and that is where I get confused as I am not sure it is<br/>\nconsidered unschooling if it is teacher directed?
