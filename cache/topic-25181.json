Even providing for<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really descibe what I mean because some of<br/>\nparenting has become a striving to be available. My<br/>\ngrowth has lead me down the unschooling path which I<br/>\noriginally saw as giving as a gift to my children. (as<br/>\nif they needed to learn how to learn) Now I see<br/>\nunschooling is the way that allows children to *be*<br/>\nthe learning people they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have had an even greater AH AH momment when I<br/>\ndecided to re-read Whole Child/Whole Parent by Polly<br/>\nBerends. I had tried to read it a few years ago but I<br/>\nwas still in a need to what I see know as fix my<br/>\nspirited dd rather than help her/ support her. When I<br/>\nread some of her words I had an immediate falling away<br/>\nof tension and awareness of what *I* needed to do so<br/>\nmy very spirited dd could be *allowed* to be who she<br/>\n*already is* a loving, learning, brite, etc...child. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I shared with Dh about this thread and seeing our<br/>\nchildren as the Messiah. He said ooh that makes a lot<br/>\nof sense. Just think his mother believed he was the<br/>\nson of God. So when she looked at him she saw the son<br/>\nof God. So she always saw good. So how could Jesus<br/>\nhelp but become good. So it has become very important<br/>\nto me to see the true pure child even when her<br/>\nbehavior does not seem in accordance with that. That<br/>\nupset/negative behavior is only an aberation or an<br/>\nindication of some unmet need. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!

With more research they will be able to<br/>\nidentify with certainty if a child is &quot;normally&quot; obsessive or if they are<br/>\ndeveloping OCD.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really too bad that folks can&#39;t &quot;get&quot; that there is a difference<br/>\nbetween &quot;normal&quot; addictions that can be laughed off (Hello, my name is<br/>\nLynda, I am a bookoholic) and psychological/emotional disorders that are<br/>\naddictions and take a life long effort to overcome, hopefully, and at a<br/>\nminimum learn to live around.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeez, everyone&#39;s an expert because they read some article somewhere.

I have, as a result of this<br/>\nunschooling list, even with all the arguments going on lately, decided to<br/>\nthrow out my chore cards.  When they were undone, I felt like I had<br/>\nfailed and like I should be more in control of things.  When I thought<br/>\nabout it, I realized it was an obsessive attempt at gaining control of a<br/>\nsituation which wasn&#39;t even out of control in the first place.  It was as<br/>\na result of someone&#39;s advice years ago to my husband, who has a problem<br/>\nwith the house due to his dysfunctional childhood.  So, my kids and I<br/>\nhave discussed it and have decided that we will all work together on the<br/>\nhouse and will just keep a look-out for things that need to be done.  We<br/>\nhave also decided to give up the program of schooling we had been doing<br/>\nand to just have the books and games available and that I am available<br/>\nshould anyone want assistance with them.  This is really a daring step<br/>\nfor me, since I am a rather insecure person.  But I have felt for some<br/>\ntime that God wanted me to learn about all this unschooling business<br/>\nsince I kept coming upon it &quot;accidentally&quot;.  The unschooling ideals have<br/>\nalso helped me in other areas of my life like bills and working and<br/>\nscheduling everything.  I knew I had control issues, because I kept<br/>\ngetting scared or mad about things and wondering why and I could only<br/>\ncome to the conclusion that I felt out of control.  Now I am giving<br/>\nmyself permission to be out of control.

Mildew prevention can be way <br/>\nmore fascinating than shirt-folding, and could lead to a lifelong fascination <br/>\nwith biochemistry or architectural engineering.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreating a child as a young human who lives in our house instead of &quot;our kid&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;a five year old&quot; or any other designation that comes with all kinds of <br/>\npre-conceived behavioral notions closes more doors than it opens.  Seeing the <br/>\nchild as an honored guest who will stay with you untl he chooses to leave <br/>\nopens all the doors in the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read once somewhere (I though it was Polly Berends, but I could never find <br/>\nthe quote) that we should treat each child as though he were the Messiah.   I <br/>\nsaid that once on a list or in a forum with a lot of Christian homeschoolers <br/>\n(it was several years back before there was much separation) and one mom <br/>\nsnapped back very defensively &quot;TRUST ME, my kid is NOT the second coming.&quot;   <br/>\nI felt really bad for her child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other religions that also suggest treating children like gods, <br/>\nseeing the godliness in them.   And in fact Christianity does too.  But <br/>\nthat&#39;s not the verse most families choose to keep in mind when they deal with <br/>\ntheir children.<br/>\n<br/>\nJesus made a pretty good threat about people who mistreat children, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t hear it quoted in homeschooling forums.  And the whole &quot;When did we see <br/>\nyou hungry and feed you, or naked and clothed you?&quot; passage *should* apply to <br/>\nchildren, but it&#39;s rarely made to do so.  People use it to promote visiting <br/>\nsick people in hospitals and charity to prisoners, but they forget to turn <br/>\naround and treat those children who are tugging at their clothes as the <br/>\nrepresentatives of Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bridget E Coffman","from":"Bridget E Coffman &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lD6FdI5jFBRY5lLIRz-wjK_TTDoIGxze7tZYy3q-aJkdjQlq4vuwNPBkufVan9V6NItTexK76HuJbbbo3t7Xowg8Ql8WpEzw-k5T45yWYeezVyU","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] My own AH HA!","postDate":"1000211520","msgId":25215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTExLjA4NTEwMy4tOTI2OTMxLjUucnVtcGxldGVhc2VybW9tQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25201,"nextInTopic":25232,"prevInTime":25214,"nextInTime":25216,"topicId":25181,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... had an ...

See this was my <br/>\nobsession and now that I&#39;ve started to wane off a bit, I can&#39;t keep up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read the eureka moments and wanted to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently my huge debate with tv was the turning point for me and my son.  <br/>\nThanks so much for everyone on here and the website for sharing their lives <br/>\nand stories. And while I&#39;ve gotten too irked to read many of her messages, I <br/>\nunderstand where Bridgett is coming from. It&#39;s (hopefully) the last great <br/>\nstance.

And that sort of allows everything else to fall into place. And, as <br/>\nsomeone on the website suggested, I&#39;m letting him show me the way. It&#39;s <br/>\nreally cool! And while he&#39;s only 3, I have more thoroughly enjoyed our <br/>\nrelationship in just the last couple weeks. And he has too, he&#39;s opened up <br/>\nmore, offered to help me with different things, etc. And he&#39;s a very verbal <br/>\narticulate child, has been for awhile, and we&#39;re talking a lot more. I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways wished he&#39;d just play more freely and I&#39;ve seen him do that more <br/>\nlately.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have related to the fears of, if I don&#39;t step in.....then what? How will he <br/>\nlearn to control himself, care for others, feed himself, etc. And they <br/>\nultimately all come from the belief that my son is somehow bad, less, wrong, <br/>\netc. and needs to be taught how to be good, more, right, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a couple of weeks ago I would have thoroughly believed that my son had an <br/>\naddiction to the tv, or was more prone to addiction, blah blah blah. But I <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel that way now. I&#39;m not doubting that there are people out there <br/>\nwith it born in, but I&#39;ve known a *lot* of addicts, myself one, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever known one that didn&#39;t have a traumatic childhood and used addiction as <br/>\nself medication.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy issue now is extending this past just my son and I. Like being around <br/>\nother parents and families who are thoroughly opposite this philosophy.
