So the friend is teaching Lexie how to <br/>\ndivide decimals... pretty funny.  She just asked Lexie what times 7 was <br/>\nless than 62 or something like that, and Lexie had the answer instantly, <br/>\nbut then she had to explain to Dana how she got the answer, which was of <br/>\ncourse mental math, and Dana didn&#39;t get it... Of course, she has the <br/>\ntimes tables memorized.... It&#39;s fun to listen to them do this homework.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.6.10 - Release Date: 1/10/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26207,"nextTopicId":102511}}
