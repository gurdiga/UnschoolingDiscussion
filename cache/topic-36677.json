Unschooling isn&#39;t about<br/>\nraising their competence to a satisfactory level but helping them acheive<br/>\nwhatever level they feel necessary. The motives behind helping them are more<br/>\nakin to the motives behind helping your husband with his hobby. You might<br/>\nnotice a book or a movie or an event and point it out. With kids you need to<br/>\ndo more since they can&#39;t access the world as easily as adults but the<br/>\nconnection between adult and child in terms of their interests is similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 9 year old is college bound as she wants to be a vet how will<br/>\n&gt; unschooling effect her chances?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As someone suggested if you focus on that as a goal, she will have devoted<br/>\nso much of her young life to it that she won&#39;t be able to change her mind if<br/>\nshe loses interest. She has loads of time and she has loads of animal<br/>\nrelated opportunities to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another list, vets came up recently and one ex-vet said that her motive<br/>\nfor being a vet was love of animals. But being a vet is very little about<br/>\nbeing with cute and cuddly animals. To be a vet the first love should really<br/>\nbe the science and medical side, investigating disease and dealing with pet<br/>\nowners. If someone loves animals there are loads of careers that will bring<br/>\nthem incontact with healthy happy animals like zoo worker, groomer, dog<br/>\ntrainer, breeder, pet shop owner, naturalist, even Jane Goodall&#39;s successor<br/>\n:-) So she should be exploring all sorts of animal related opportunities,<br/>\nwhatever interests her, regardless of whether it lies on the path to<br/>\nvethood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What is a typical day?We start out with household chores,animal<br/>\n&gt; chores,then bible usually prayer & a reading from our family<br/>\n&gt; bible,then math,we do units for history&science usually hands on<br/>\n&gt; stuff.We do our language with our journals & spelling from misspelled<br/>\n&gt; words.We do weekly/daily trips to our local beach&libary.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A typical day is like most people&#39;s typical weekend or summer days. I tend<br/>\nto need force myself into doing things and steering things into our lives<br/>\nthan just living life would do because I tend to be, uh, low energy ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All my guys are animal buffs so we are about to start breeding<br/>\n&gt; bunnies next year.Also hopefully chicks.The children will learn all<br/>\n&gt; about raising them & will be selling them as a unit on running a<br/>\n&gt; business.Would it be hard for me to  switch to unschooling????<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it would depend what you want from unschooling. If you want<br/>\nacademics with less work, you&#39;re going to be disappointed. If you want them<br/>\nto explore what interests them to discover more about who they are, then it<br/>\nwill work fine. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45755436,"authorName":"susan marie","from":"susan marie &lt;scribblers2@...&gt;","profile":"scribblers2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling newbie","postDate":"1020439848","msgId":36703,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJFQTQzNUI2LTVFQUEtMTFENi05Q0U2LTAwMDM5MzUzOEM5OEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg4LjE3YmQxYzhlLjJhMDQwMGM3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36702,"nextInTopic":36724,"prevInTime":36702,"nextInTime":36704,"topicId":36677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"well, yes, but that was on the quiz as a choice.. a poorly thought out question.
