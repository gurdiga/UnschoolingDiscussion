The area of working and unschooling<br/>\nis something I&#39;ve had experience in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started unschooling when my older daugther was 7 and my younger 5. I<br/>\nteach parttime at a small local college which only required  I<br/>\nactually be on campus 12 hours a week. What I did was to find/create<br/>\nactivities/classes my kids were interested in primarily through our<br/>\nhomeschooling group which puts out a calander of activities every month.<br/>\nSometimes I had to create the opportunity myself, for instance by<br/>\ncontacting a dance studio and asking it they could teach a class at such<br/>\nand such a time (when I had to be at work). Then I&#39;d call around to other<br/>\nhs&#39;ers and try to find interested dancers. Then I&#39;d ask another mom<br/>\nwhose children had signed up  if I could drop off my daughters at their<br/>\nhouse so she could take them and her daughter to class at the same time.<br/>\nUsually it wasn&#39;t asking too much if I could drop them off an hour ahead<br/>\nof time (the girls could play with their child) and I could return the<br/>\nfavor by picking them all up after the class and maybe bringing their<br/>\nchild to my house to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are always places that are unused during the school day<br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t mind opening their facility for hs&#39;ers: gymnastics studios,<br/>\nplaces that teach children&#39;s art classes, tennis facilties, pottery<br/>\nplaces that teach classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this didn&#39;t work all the time. Sometimes I just had to do the<br/>\ntrade thing: I&#39;ll have your child to play this day, if my girls can come<br/>\nplay at your house this day. And fortuneately I had several moms from my<br/>\nhs group that this worked with (meaning that our kids got along well<br/>\nenough that seeing each other a few times a week wasn&#39;t too much).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen all else failed I had to bring them to the college and let them color<br/>\nor play on the computer or play with legos while I taught my classes. They<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t like this scenario and it was a bit dubious from the<br/>\ncollege&#39;s pt. of view. Sometimes I could take them to their dad&#39;s office<br/>\nwho teaches at the same college. sometimes he had a hour free to take them<br/>\nto lunch or to the college gym.<br/>\n<br/>\nREmember too that they grow up fast. Now mine are 10 and 12 and I can<br/>\nleave them to do their own projects for a few hours at time. Although<br/>\nthese young years seem interminable while you&#39;re in them, in reality they<br/>\nfly by. Mostly you need to find a job with flexible hours and you need to<br/>\nlook for multiple solutions to childcare. It really helps to have a hs<br/>\nsupport group and a husband able to take up some slack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s much more I could impart, so if you have other questions feel free<br/>\nto ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn<br/>\nYou could email me individually at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aleadbet@...\">aleadbet@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Roop0625@xxx.xxx","from":"Roop0625@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"BVK6eUK23fyg4_AJiN2g4ap2YO-rWj19ZPhvTISx9Q99ghquHgh8v44LZgP6V_LU7NQGceb2Qg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: burnout, working and hsing, careers","postDate":"937623047","msgId":3009,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMDkuMzAwOS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3029,"prevInTime":3008,"nextInTime":3010,"topicId":3009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, everyone!
