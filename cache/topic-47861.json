It depends on their personalities. They seem to be either good or bad <br/>\nand no in between!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad ones are nerve wracking. They poop in the corners of your house if <br/>\nyou leave them loose, they refuse to litter train, they bite and scratch and <br/>\njust behae as not good pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good ones get along great with dogs and cats and people. They are funny <br/>\nand sweet and litter train easily and become joys to behold.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll ferrets smell. They don&#39;t stink but they do have an odor. Some people <br/>\nhardly notice. Some ferret love baths and if bathed like once a week, no <br/>\nsmell. They all love to play so leaving things out that you treasure if they <br/>\nare loose is a no no. Certain things fascinate them and they will scoop them <br/>\nup to play and you may never see them again. They also love small places and <br/>\ncan squeeze anywhere their little heads fit. Behind appliances and any kind <br/>\nof opening in the house must be ferret proofed before you let them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they do play, some can get very rambunctious. For very small children, <br/>\nit might not be a good idea. And some can get carried away and bite. It <br/>\nhurts. They have the tiniest sharpest little teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople either love them as pets or swear never again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nUnlimited Internet access for only $21.95/month.ï¿½ Try MSN! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/2monthsfree.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/2monthsfree.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: ferrets","postDate":"1035506083","msgId":47861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBINEkwME1VREhMVjVDQG10YTcucGx0bjEzLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47889,"prevInTime":47860,"nextInTime":47862,"topicId":47861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A<br/>\nmature 10 or so would probably be fine. They&#39;re very active, busy,<br/>\nintelligent, and not unwilling to bite if not well trained and socialized.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys smell more than the girls, but with bathing and frequent litter box<br/>\nchanges, the odor isn&#39;t overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re allergic to other mammals I&#39;d find a ferret breeder, or spend a<br/>\nbunch of time with some ferrets in a pet store, and see how you react before<br/>\nyou decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12444,"nextTopicId":15277}}
