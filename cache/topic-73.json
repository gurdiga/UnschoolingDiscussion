I love<br/>\nto do research and so after we decided I set about reading as much as I<br/>\ncould about homeschooling<br/>\nand that is how we ended up becoming unschoolers.  I am now reading John<br/>\nHolts books and they<br/>\njust reinforce everything I knew in my heart and logical mind.  I still have<br/>\nthe problem with testing or not<br/>\ntesting, I really like feedback and I still have the public school instilled<br/>\nneed for knowing if she is learning<br/>\nI fight my urge to test her even informally.  And everyonce and awhile she<br/>\nwill surprise me by knowing something I was sure she didn&#39;t.<br/>\nI am so glad there is this list and site I don&#39;t know any unschooler in my<br/>\narea everyone seems or school at home.  and I just love getting email!!!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56,"nextTopicId":75}}
