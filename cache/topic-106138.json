It has mostly been made up <br/>\nof relaxed homeschoolers and unschoolers. One of the things have talked <br/>\nabout for years is having a&quot;space&quot; to hang out, having meetings in and <br/>\ndo activities that are not great for someone&#39;s home.<br/>\nOne of the other founding members of Live and Learn began working at an <br/>\nafter school care program at their church which had a lot of unused <br/>\nspace. She asked them if it could be rented and they were willing to <br/>\nrent it at a very, very cheap price. We have one main room that was once <br/>\ntheir sanctuary, a kitchen, den, 2 &quot;classrooms&quot; and use of the gym, <br/>\nplayground and grounds. We&#39;re there from 10ish to about 2:30 on Tuesdays <br/>\nand Thursdays and we have a $20 a month fee. We decided not to be <br/>\naffiliated with our support group, but most of the members of the <br/>\nHomeschool Zone come from there. I think we have 15 - 20 families who pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI call it perpetual recess which is a title I stole from an article in <br/>\nHEM last year about a co-op in the northeast. Our initial idea was to <br/>\nhave a part-time &quot;free-school&quot; type of situation. We soon realized that <br/>\nin this part of the country a freeschool was not gonna happen and its <br/>\nbecome more like a very loosely run co-op. We&#39;ve found that in this part <br/>\nof the country even a loosely run, non-religious, non-corrosive, <br/>\nfree-choice, its-ok-to-hang-out-and-play-video-games-all-day co-op has a <br/>\nhard time attracting members. Everyone is just too busy &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>\nand if they are going to do something that might take time out of their <br/>\n&quot;school day&quot; it had better fill some kind of educational need.<br/>\n~meh~<br/>\nSo we have a weekly schedule that comes out via email. This week&#39;s <br/>\nschedule looked like this:<br/>\n10-? Music Morning (one of the moms brings her accordion and auto harp <br/>\nand will play tunes for us to sing to. Yesterday it was Beatles songs <br/>\nand then she began teaching another mom who to play the autoharp)<br/>\nDuring this time &quot;doll club&quot; was happening and video games were being <br/>\nplayed also.<br/>\nThere was also moms sitting around talking, Tuckervill was in town so it <br/>\nwas nice to sit and talk to her about the baby. We talked some abut the <br/>\nfunshop I&#39;m gonna try and do at the Live and Learn conference. I think <br/>\nthe girls went outside at some point to ride scooters.<br/>\n11:45 Lunch<br/>\n12:45 Cartooning  (I&#39;m meeting with some kids and moms who want to work <br/>\non drawing cartoons. We&#39;re all working out of different books and off <br/>\nand on I&#39;ll point out something, but its fun just to work with others) <br/>\nduring this time moms with younger kids went to the playground.<br/>\nThe rest of the day kids played and hung out. I know at some point there <br/>\nwere a few guys out front hacking and slashing with boffer swords. I <br/>\nknow they went to the gym for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday is like this:<br/>\n10ish Old Tyme show and tell (bring in antiques and heirlooms and talk <br/>\nabout them...this is facilitated by a 9yr old girl)<br/>\n10:45 Digital scavenger hunt   (this is being facilitated by an 11 yr <br/>\nold. He is coming up with a list and we will break into groups with a <br/>\nvan and digital camera and go find what is on his list. Afterwards we <br/>\nwill come back and look through the pics to see who found what.)<br/>\n11:45ish Lunch<br/>\n1:00 Cheerleading (one of our moms does this and we have this group of <br/>\nlittle girls who just adore it)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost days have more in them. I like the lightly scheduled days, but a <br/>\ngood amount of members just won&#39;t come if there is nothing scheduled. <br/>\nThey miss the best days at the Zone because those days end up being so <br/>\nmuch better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like fun, huh?<br/>\nFor us it is---we have all we need there in an endless supply of boys <br/>\n(and some girls) who will hang out with Josh and play VG or boffer <br/>\nswords. Sometimes he will get out Heroscape and play that. He does the <br/>\ncartooning with me and if there is some type of theater thing (like <br/>\nimporv) going on will join in those classes. The truth is it is more <br/>\nstressful for me. I make the schulde and deal with the complaints that <br/>\nthere is not &quot;anything I can&#39;t do at home. Why would I miss a day of <br/>\nschool to do something I can do at home with my kids?&quot;---arrggghhh, then <br/>\nplan something you find value in and see if anyone else wants to do it. <br/>\nI really think that this would be the case among any group of folks who <br/>\nhave some very distinct differences in how they raise their children and <br/>\nhow they homeschool. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is working, there is just <br/>\nalways a group of folks with in any homeschooling thing I&#39;ve ever been <br/>\ninvolved in who want so much but want everyone else to do the work.<br/>\n~sheesh~<br/>\nI also spend time running interference for Josh and the moms who have <br/>\nproblems with VG.<br/>\nThis was our 1st year and over the summer we will go to just Thursdays <br/>\nand discuss what worked and what did not work this year. One thing that <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed is that the child facilitated activities seem to be better <br/>\nattended and enjoyed, I also have seen a few flop because the child <br/>\nfacilitating had no support from their parent.<br/>\nWe also have a lack of teens. I hope we can work on getting more <br/>\nfamilies with older kids involved next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/\">http://jwoolfolk.typepad.com/theothermother/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":42924764,"authorName":"Marjorie Kirk","from":"&quot;Marjorie Kirk&quot; &lt;mkirk@...&gt;","profile":"mdlfkirk","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Very sorry.

There is a second room at the studio and the <br/>\nkids hang out there all the rest of the day and play games - then she <br/>\ngoes to another karate class at 7:30 pm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a dozen or so kids who spend time there - mostly boys ages 12 <br/>\nto 20. They play Risk, card games like Magic, the Gathering, they play <br/>\nvideo games, they play physical games like dodge ball, and they &quot;just <br/>\ntalk.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this. I so appreciate the karate studio owner - an unschooling <br/>\nmom - who lets this happen there. Her kids (12 and 16) hang out, too, <br/>\nmost of the time - but sometimes they go do other things, and she still <br/>\nlets the game time go on. It is so wonderful for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 24, 2005, at 1:25 PM, Julie W wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We do this Tuesday/Thursday thingee (it was started to be a type of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;freeschool&quot;, but is working more like a co-op but with free choice, on<br/>\n&gt; my blog I use the term perpetual recess) and one of my son&#39;s first<br/>\n&gt; questions was &quot;can we play video games?&quot; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Very sorry.

Then they came over to our house and the boys played video <br/>\ngames all afternoon and didn&#39;t want to leave (they&#39;re very limited on <br/>\nVG at their house). The mom has since made sure that the kids meet at <br/>\ntheir house, not our house.

That includes video and just hanging out.&quot; My idea was that a <br/>\nstructured activity has just as much value as playing VGs and hanging <br/>\nout as long as it is the child&#39;s choice.<br/>\nWhat a can of worms.<br/>\nMy whole focus this year has been to preserve the rights of the gamer <br/>\nkids to make their choices free of interference from some of the other <br/>\nmoms while staying sane and not saying things to ruin long friendships. <br/>\nWith some folks being tolerant only seems to go one way when it has to <br/>\ndo with electronic media. Now these moms have no problem if the kids are <br/>\nplaying Magic or Heroscape, they just wish that the kids had never <br/>\nchosen to play video games there (some of the issues have to do with the <br/>\ncontrols they place on their children and the fact that their kids at <br/>\ntimes would prefer to be in the gamer room then go to another activity) <br/>\nand are quite vocal about it and have made my son, at times, feel like <br/>\nhe had done something wrong by even starting the gamers group.<br/>\nOf course I have noticed that kids like my son will move from thing to <br/>\nthing (like an ethnic cooking lesson or boffer swords---as long as it is <br/>\nsomething he is interested in doing) because he is already aware that <br/>\nthe video games will always be there, he can play whenever he wants to <br/>\nand he&#39;ll be able to play at home. Some of the other boys have had a <br/>\nhard time because their moms will control the amount of time they can <br/>\nplay and they either are not allowed at home OR their VG time is limited <br/>\nat home. It has gotten better for these guys as they see that every time <br/>\nwe get together the VG will be available, but some of the moms are so <br/>\nfocused on those evil video games that the have a hard time seeing that <br/>\nthe kids do choose to leave the games and go do something else when it <br/>\nstrikes their interest.<br/>\nI feel for those other kids---they are kids I&#39;ve seen grow up and I <br/>\nreally like.
