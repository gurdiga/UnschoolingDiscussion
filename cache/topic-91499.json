The tray features the numbers 1 - 9 in a row,<br/>\neach of which has a hinged or sliding cover.  A turn involves repeatedly <br/>\nthrowing the dice and shutting or covering a number or pair of numbers every <br/>\nthrow.  The turn ends when no numbers can be covered upon the throw of the dice at <br/>\nwhicbox&quot; which results in the best possible score of zero.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it lists pubs in England where there is league play!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Another picture of Countdown","postDate":"1077909675","msgId":91510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNi4yYWZhODQ3Yy4yZDcwZjJhYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":91509,"nextInTopic":91514,"prevInTime":91509,"nextInTime":91511,"topicId":91499,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Shut the box is a two-player game too, but you take turns.
