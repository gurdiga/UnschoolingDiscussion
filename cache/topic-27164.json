We placed kids in the oven of <br/>\nformal education for 12 years, and then served them up to employers. <br/>\n(A select minority got a final, four-year basting at a place called <br/>\ncollege.) But this model doesn&#39;t work in a world of accelerated cycle <br/>\ntimes, shrinking company half-lives, and the rapid obsolescence of <br/>\nknowledge and skills. In a free agent economy, our education system <br/>\nmust allow people to learn throughout their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHome schooling and alternatives to high school will create a nation <br/>\nof self-educators, free agent learners, if you will. Adults who were <br/>\nhome-schooled youths will know how to learn and expect to continue <br/>\nthe habit throughout their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27161,"nextTopicId":27165}}
