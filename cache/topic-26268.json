It is so hard for some folks to let go of being<br/>\njudgemental and I don&#39;t mean simply of others but of their own lives as well<br/>\nand to stop equating change, growth, and different with better.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo look at everything as a journey, the past as the foundation of your<br/>\nfuture, changes as growth and those changes as a step in that journey, not<br/>\nnecessarily as &quot;better&quot; but as &quot;different&quot; because of where you are in your<br/>\njourney is hard for some.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is all about the individual, trusting the individual to know<br/>\nthemselves, their wants, their needs and that individuality should be<br/>\ncelebrated and shared.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read too many books with &quot;God&quot; in their title as that is not part<br/>\nof our spirituality.  However, I am getting a different take on this book<br/>\nafter reading your thoughts about it.  Guess I&#39;ll give it a glance or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you did a great job of explaining!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; For me personally, I am on the list to interact with other unschoolers,<br/>\n&gt; hopefully giving and receiving support. I definitely don&#39;t think my life<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; better than anyone&#39;s. . . simply not for me to make that judgement,<br/>\n&gt; nor are my ideas more or less valid. I make plenty of mistakes as a<br/>\nparent,  an unschooler, a human being. There have been times in my life<br/>\nwhere I<br/>\n&gt; have parented very differntly from where I am at now. . . .I am not<br/>\nbetter<br/>\n&gt; now, I am simply different, I am choosing differently, which to me, is<br/>\nwhat<br/>\n&gt; life is about, the ability to choose differently in any moment, and become<br/>\n&gt; more of  Who I Am. If I felt that others were giving me advice or support<br/>\nbased on  what I call &quot;the betterness myth&quot;, then they would lose me. I hope<br/>\n&gt; (and know I sometimes fail miserable) that I will not give advice in that<br/>\n&gt; manner. If I do, I welcome being reminded of my words and beliefs. And<br/>\nit&#39;s fine  for others to disagree, in fact on this list, I would expect<br/>\nnothing  less,<br/>\n&gt; but I want to be clear about Who I Am in relation to this list and what I<br/>\n&gt; want to be getting/giving in relation to it.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Because for me they simply are not &quot;better&quot;. They are the choices I make<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; I certainly cannot make that distinction for someone else. The myth about<br/>\n&gt; betterness promotes separation in our society. . . it puts us in and &quot;us<br/>\n&gt; versus them&quot; mentality. It puts us at war with each other. It puts us in a<br/>\n&gt; heiarchy. I personally choose to not live like that anymore. I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; be or feel separateness from others because I feel I am better/above/more<br/>\n&gt; evolved than someone. I also don&#39;t want to judge what I have done in the<br/>\npast<br/>\n&gt; by saying what I do now is better. Because what I did in the past got me<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; this point. . . the process is all as it should be. . . I needed those<br/>\n&gt; experiences to get to this point and beyond.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a wonderful passage from the book &quot;Conversations wtih God&quot; about<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; betterness myth, and how it contributes to the way our society is and the<br/>\n&gt; problems we face as a society. I will try and find it to post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One last point is that I have no desire to change anyone&#39;s beliefs about<br/>\n&gt; this. . . what I do enjoy however, is explaining what I do believe and<br/>\nfine<br/>\n&gt; tuning that. Thanks for all those giving me that opportunity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; lovemary </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8M32OuDnEVDfzJTuRh9FfBC4Z4iuTdcN3h9cgC3FIzaMyI-TEmgz_IhDx4eJtFTL9DoGTIKyY_PRa1b6CjFx1BRqcW_46sqZLFY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: sharing knowledge, sharing lives","postDate":"1001612842","msgId":26341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMDkyNzEwNDYwOS4wMjVhYWM3MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwOTI3LjA5MTQyMS4tMTU5NTU1LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26340,"nextInTopic":26343,"prevInTime":26340,"nextInTime":26342,"topicId":26268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s clear he thinks his stuff is better than some other (named) <br/>\nstuff, and that it&#39;s good to promote what one believes is &quot;a good message.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd the people writing here about unschooling have the dubious honor of doing <br/>\ntheir promoting for free--donating their time to helping other moms.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Neale.....<br/>\nI am one of those readers who recently discovered CWG by its falling off the <br/>\nshelf onto my head--&quot;thank God!&quot; Actually, I have been on &quot;the path&quot; for a <br/>\nnumber of years (lifetimes) and I have read many books from all angles, but I <br/>\nmust tell you that this book was (and continues to be) a real knockout. I <br/>\ngobbled down the book over the Christmas holidays and have not been able to <br/>\nread anything else since (very unlike my personal habit...). Anyway, I got to <br/>\nthinking about this change in my behavior and began to wonder if others were <br/>\naffected in the same manner. My question: Is this turning into a &quot;cult <br/>\nthing&quot;??? The book really moved me in a profound way and it makes me happy <br/>\nthat sooo many people are &quot;searching&quot;, but it&#39;s beginning to look a little <br/>\n&quot;slick&quot; with its having a Web Site, study groups, intensive workshops, etc. <br/>\nI, like all the people out there who are getting involved, may be too <br/>\nvulnerable and susceptible to its gravitational pull. Can you address these <br/>\nquestioning &quot;feelings&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nTom S., <br/>\nBlacksburg, VA. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Tom.....<br/>\nI’m going to admit here to being a bit sensitive to your kind of question. I <br/>\nnotice I often get my &quot;hackles up&quot; when someone says something like this. Not <br/>\nfor long. Just for an instant. Still, my mother would say, &quot;Are you sure <br/>\nthat’s not because there’s a bit of truth to it?&quot; Somehow I don’t think so. <br/>\nI think it’s because I just haven’t yet gotten over the reaction I have to <br/>\ncertain negative, unhealed thoughts which roam the universe. For instance, <br/>\nthe thought that to do something -- anything -- which gets the word out to a <br/>\nlarger audience about God’s magical, magnificent love is somehow besmirching <br/>\nthe message or despoiling the process. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I notice is that today even churches have web sites. It’s what’s <br/>\nhappening. A web site today is rapidly becoming like the telephone of <br/>\nyesterday -- a simple, fast, expedient form of communication; an absolutely <br/>\nessential apparatus; a means of getting and staying in touch. What’s &quot;wrong&quot; <br/>\nwith that? Why does having a web site suddenly render us &quot;slick&quot;? I think it <br/>\nrenders us smart. Does &quot;smart&quot; mean &quot;slick&quot;? If, in fact, our intention is to <br/>\nhelp as many other people as possible hear more about, and benefit from, the <br/>\nextraordinary message in Conversations with God, are we being too &quot;slick&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe could, of course, simply surrender the mass media and the Internet to the <br/>\npeople who really are being slick; to the purveyors of silliness and <br/>\npornography; to the sellers of trinkets and the hawkers and gawkers...but <br/>\nsomehow it seems that it should be okay for people who have a good message to <br/>\nsend out, to also use these avenues of communication. What do you think? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about those Study Groups. We have had nothing to do with their <br/>\nformation. They have been forming spontaneously all over the country and <br/>\naround the world without any input or any request from us. Some of the groups <br/>\nhave written to us telling us of their existence, and asking us to let others <br/>\nin their area know of their existence through our newsletter. We thought of <br/>\ndemanding that these groups disband at once because they would be seen as &quot;a <br/>\ncult thing,&quot; but we dropped that idea as too reactionary... <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, our workshops, seminars and 5-day intensives. Well, now, there you <br/>\nhave us, Tom. You’ve caught us red handed. Surely any organization or <br/>\nmovement based in fundamental truth and motivated by a sincere and pure <br/>\ndesire to simply share that truth in a way which it hoped would bring help to <br/>\nothers, would never hold a class or a retreat or a workshop. It is shameful. <br/>\nIt does have a high sleaze factor. It is &quot;slick,&quot; there’s no question about <br/>\nit. Imagine, holding an actual 5-day retreat to help people get more closely <br/>\nin touch with the powerful message in this extraordinary book. We should have <br/>\nknown better than to try to get away with something like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, Tom, Tom...I guess I should stop with the humor already (I suppose some <br/>\nwould call it sarcasm) and just address your question head on. Tom, Tom...the <br/>\nwhole point of Conversations with God is that we are each responsible for <br/>\nourselves. You talk about you and all the other people out there who are <br/>\n&quot;getting involved&quot; in CWG being &quot;too vulnerable and susceptible&quot; for its <br/>\n&quot;gravitational pull.&quot; Do you seriously advance this as a reason for us to <br/>\nstay off the web, prohibit study groups, and never give another workshop? <br/>\nShall we make ourselves responsible for you, Tom, and make sure we don’t do <br/>\nanything that might &quot;pull you into our clutches&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a better way for us to proceed, Tom, is to put together a program and <br/>\nmake information available which teaches people how to stop being so <br/>\n&quot;vulnerable and susceptible.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs my teenager would say...&quot;Now there’s a concept!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessed be. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"r-t1XsLH7ZLbpXVZda4lrgqFfiE4wDzfW74drpl2SoUjClwx_DThYOEbsvOpkfQQRg0YMHYBlx8R","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: sharing knowledge, sharing lives","postDate":"1001603095","msgId":26320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyLjFhY2NhNTg4LjI4ZTQ5YTE3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26319,"nextInTopic":26322,"prevInTime":26319,"nextInTime":26321,"topicId":26268,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-487648554\">&lt;&lt; But when one of them starts pushing her agenda, I lose respect for <br/>\nthat person -- schooling issue or other.
