On Sunday after church, we had a few things to do at <br/>\nthe church and at the parsonage before we could go home, so my kids <br/>\nwaited and played with some neighborhood kids while we did those <br/>\nthings. There were a five year old boy and two year old girl, and <br/>\nsidewalk chalks. We left them playing and did our chores, then came <br/>\nback and chatted with the mom for a sec while the kids wrapped up. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy this time, they had moved to the grass where they were playing <br/>\ntag. My &quot;socially clueless&quot; 10 year old boy slowed down his own pace <br/>\nso the littler kids could catch him, and when the two year old got <br/>\ninto chasing and pushing, he let himself fall down with great <br/>\nalarming shouts of fear, and be romped on. It was heart warming to <br/>\nwatch his sensitivity to others come out in his play like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC, enjoying the observing of her children VERY much.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74705,"nextTopicId":74715}}
