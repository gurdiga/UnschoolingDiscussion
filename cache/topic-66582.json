It isn&#39;t <br/>\nthere, but my post about emailing Mrs. O&#39;Malley is. hmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a plan to help me get over my fear of Robby playing non-stop <br/>\ncomputer games: ask him about it. We had &quot;Stay Up Alone Night&quot; last <br/>\nnight and the night before. Katie, last night; Robby night before. He <br/>\nwas up until 4:00 a.m. playing online video games. And yesterday, <br/>\nspent a goodly amount of time playing online video games. And you <br/>\nknow what I did? Not only did I bite my tongue about how he was <br/>\nspending his time, I went over and watched him play for awhile. He <br/>\nexplained the game (Some Ed, Edd, and Eddy thing) and asked if I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt SO good, not to be uptight about what he was doing, and he <br/>\nwas clearly pleased that I expressed interest in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHubby and I talked last night, him wanting to know if this &quot;up alone&quot; <br/>\ntime was going to become a trend. I pointed out to him that the <br/>\nlast &quot;up alone night&quot; was in January or February. They love it; they <br/>\nare satisfied for a long time (at least a few months between such <br/>\nevents); and we learn to trust them. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did have to emphasize with my husband: this is going to <br/>\nmean us being much more involved. No more telling them to siddown and <br/>\nget their (fill in the academic blank) done, but inviting them to <br/>\ncome help with the wood fire, helping them knead the bread dough, <br/>\nplaying cribbage when they ask us to, being willing for the bathroom <br/>\nto get trashed so they can make home-made &quot;treasure rocks.&quot; IOW, <br/>\nchilling and doing things WITH them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncluding, conversations about Tolkien with our 15 year old. Why do <br/>\nI, whose favorite author IS Tolkien, just do this &quot;uh-huh&quot; half-<br/>\nlistening, not attending, rude thing, when she wants to talk about <br/>\nLOTR? Just because it&#39;s all she talks about right now, doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t encourage it by participating. &quot;What a cool picture of a <br/>\nbalrog. Where did you get it?&quot;  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s get the latest Elijah <br/>\nWood movie and watch it.&quot;   Or, ask her, because she knows MUCH more <br/>\nabout Middle Earth than I do. Well, I do some of that. She laughs at <br/>\nme, because I don&#39;t know the names of the different elvish races. L<br/>\n<br/>\nanyways. Feeling like I&#39;m getting a handle on this (unnerving, <br/>\nexciting) way of living.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66581,"nextTopicId":66610}}
