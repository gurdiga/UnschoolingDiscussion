We <br/>\nwere given a very fortunate opportunity to buy this house a year ago. Ready <br/>\nfor a soap opera :0) ? We were happy in our little starter cape cod, I called <br/>\nit my &quot;doll house&quot;. I had no desire to move or upgrade. Except for the public <br/>\nschool. In April of 2001, I was seriously considering homeschooling. Then my <br/>\nfather makes us an offer to buy his house, after he lived here alone for many <br/>\nyears. My mom had moved out a few years after they had bought it together. <br/>\nThey had made many attempts to reconcile. This time they were getting back <br/>\ntogether for good, and he was moving in with her. He had offered to sell this <br/>\nhouse to us several times, and we never took him seriously, he is very <br/>\nfickle. I was also pregnant and due in June. It was the craziest thing we <br/>\never did. We moved in the first week of May, 2001. I thought the opportunity <br/>\nwas God&#39;s way of giving Megan a new start at a new school. The new district <br/>\nwas a small improvement, but I know now why it ultimately failed her again. I <br/>\nhave learned more about compulsory education AFTER I removed her in February. <br/>\nI had some guilt that I didn&#39;t start her homeschooling at the old house, but <br/>\nI had a lot of anxiety then, how could I be her teacher when she was defiant <br/>\nabout anything involving teaching? Anyhoo, it has been much easier starting <br/>\nit in this house, with the baby older and more independent. I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nsound like I am bragging, but I love this house. I didn&#39;t really care for it <br/>\nwhen my parents bought it, but I am so glad my dad made me an offer I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t refuse. It would have been more than we could afford, but he gave it <br/>\nto us furnished and below market value. It sits on a big pond(probably an <br/>\nacre), that 5 or 6 houses all have a piece of. We have gotten to observe <br/>\ncanada geese, a great blue heron, rabbits nesting somewhere nearby, we have <br/>\nhummingbirds, and now there are white ducks that someone asked the neighbor <br/>\nto let live here. There is a huge basement that my parents finished, but my <br/>\ndad never used for years. We put all our old furniture down there, including <br/>\nentertainment center, and my dh was calling it the &quot;man room&quot;, because it <br/>\nused to have a pool table that dad got rid of, and it has beer signs all <br/>\nover. It was his room to get away from us hyper girls LOL. Slowly i have made <br/>\nit the homeschool room LOL. I took down the lighted bar signs, and covered up <br/>\nanother one with a big poster, and added other signs and posters that are <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot;.  It was a nice place to start in the cold of february, lots of <br/>\nroom for the little ones to play while Megan and I explored subjects <br/>\ntogether. Also, plenty of room for Megan, the kinesthetic and distracted <br/>\ntype, to move about. Now we hardly go down there, so we have been bringing <br/>\nbooks up, and we spend a lot of time outdoors. But I have a feeling, as it <br/>\ngets hot and humid out, we will be down there more.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH, and my dad bought my old house after it sat empty for sale for 6 <br/>\nmonths...........<br/>\nAng<br/>\nSAHM to<br/>\nMegan Elizabeth 8/8/92 8lbs 8oz<br/>\nAshlyn Olivia 7/25/99 9lbs 8oz<br/>\n Christian James 6/09/01 9lbs 5oz<br/>\n   &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;\">http://www.twgallery.8m.com/MEGAMOM08.html&quot;</a>&gt;Meet MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt;   <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/christian.html&quot;</a>&gt;Christian&#39;s Birth Story&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/megamom08/mygirlspage.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Girls page&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n|w|w|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Deschooling ending or what?","postDate":"1021987289","msgId":37185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjZGhrcCszaWY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDViLjI4MTBhZjkyLjJhMWE1YTNhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37160,"nextInTopic":37186,"prevInTime":37184,"nextInTime":37186,"topicId":37130,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ang, Your house sounds cool.

She has always had <br/>\nthis thing about &quot;alone&quot;. In our old cape cod house a year ago, she had a <br/>\nbedroom upstairs while our bedroom was downstairs. She hated going up there <br/>\nto play, sleep, etc. I basically let her do whatever she wants, and at first <br/>\nI was &quot;worried&quot; because she would only seem motivated for &quot;real learning&quot; in <br/>\nspurts, then I read how children learn in waves, sometimes taking longer <br/>\nperiods to process and reflect, and they are still learning whether it shows <br/>\nfrom the outside. I have not shared any of these concerns with her, just <br/>\nwanted her to be free of pressure. We don&#39;t watch much tv, she doesn&#39;t read a <br/>\nfull book by herself, she would rather I read aloud to her (and I have, but <br/>\nwant to more than I have), she leaves a lot of &quot;projects&quot; and books <br/>\nunfinished, but that&#39;s normal, I hope? When we started in February, she had <br/>\nan interest in learning French. We (okay, I) kind of went a *little* <br/>\noverboard, buying up books, getting materials from the library, almost making <br/>\na unit of it. We learned about Impressionists, went to the museum, which she <br/>\nbegged to do, but hasn&#39;t really done more than learn some numbers and common <br/>\nphrases. I was enjoying it, because I retained some of my 3 years of high <br/>\nschool french, because i did learn most of it by interest. So maybe she had <br/>\nall she needed of it for now, and I let it go. The same for a few other <br/>\ntopics. But now she liked it &quot;better&quot; when we got up on a schedule, and I was <br/>\ngiving her a plan to follow and materials to explore. It was by no means <br/>\n&quot;school at home&quot;. We do a lot together, I probably overdo it with leaving <br/>\nthings strewn about (especially laundry LOL LOL my house hasn&#39;t been the same <br/>\nsince bringing her home), but i still think she expects us to sit at a table <br/>\nand &quot;learn&quot;. My next question: does anyone explain what unschooling is to <br/>\ntheir kids, do their kids ever question why things are so unstructured? This <br/>\nprobably would only apply to the ex-schooled children who are learning the <br/>\nconcept of &quot;natural&quot; learning right along with their self-conscious moms!!  <br/>\nShould I try to explain what I have read by Holt, or that I was mistaken in <br/>\nassuming that schooling was necessary to learn?  I haven&#39;t really explained <br/>\nit to her, would that help alleviate her need to play school?
