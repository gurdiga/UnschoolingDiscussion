When I couldn&#39;t talk to the perspective employee because <br/>\nof missed calls it didn&#39;t bother me. I expected a kid to show up on <br/>\nmy doorstep if he wanted a chance. The best advice I have is this: <br/>\nfind out from a secretary, receptionist, or any other employee what <br/>\ntime the hiring manager is in and able to see people, what the best <br/>\ntime to talk to him is...and go there. Personnel managers like to see <br/>\npeople in person, also, in some job situations these people are so <br/>\nbusy with other tasks, they don&#39;t follow up on applications, they <br/>\nwait until someone walks in the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelling oneself is quite embarrassing, I almost lost my first job <br/>\nbecause I was so nervous and hardly spoke a word. At the end of the <br/>\ninterview I managed to blurt out:<br/>\n&quot; I really want to work, I&#39;ll work hard&quot; and the guy hired me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rehearse some lines with your son about why he&#39;ll be right for a <br/>\njob at their place.

Is <br/>\nthere anyone you know that he can talk too?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople&#39;s comments on volunteering are right on. I just got a great <br/>\npart-time job because of volunteering. If he wants to get a job with <br/>\nthe county, he could try using any 4H contacts you have. Also, as far <br/>\nas what to put on a job application when he hasn&#39;t worked....I had my <br/>\nson list Boy Scouts and 4H activities.

Everyone has something to put on a resume.  A &quot;functional&quot; resume emphasizes skills rather than employment.  Instead of date/job title/skills and responsibilties, it has skills/description of how learned.  He can get a sample at the employment office.  It could have different types of experience such as unpaid/volunteer work or other activities.  This is the best type for someone with no previous employment.  <br/>\n <br/>\nA resume and application basically have the exact same information on them.  Even with a resume, he would still need to completely fill out an application.  So, a *master application* might be best for him.  It is just a generic appliation with the blanks filled in.  Applications all ask the same basic questions.  This way when he goes to get an application, he has all the info right there with him.  (This shows preparation.)<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we had a family business, I did much of the interviewing.  Generally, we hired entry level (delivery/warehouse), and then promoted them if they were willing and able to stick it out.  If they filled out the application while there, they received an interview (provided they were neatly dressed, no piercings showing, hair a natural looking color, etc.).  ***If they took the application and returned it later, we accepted it, quickly glanced at it, and let them know we would call them later for an interview.  We did NOT call very many back over the years.***<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes when people go in to look for a job, they ask the wrong kinds of questions.  How much does it pay?  How long is the lunch break?  How much time off for vacation?  IF he&#39;s asking questions when he goes in initially, it should be about the company where he&#39;s applying.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEven if he is applying for a job where jeans would be appropriate to wear to work, he should probably wear slacks for the application and interview. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf the employment ad came out on a Sunday, he should be going to apply on Monday or Tuesday at the latest.  Later in the week and it is sometimes assumed they aren&#39;t really interested in the job.   <br/>\n <br/>\nIs he letting everyone know he is looking for a job?  Networking with friends is often a great way to get a foot in the door.  Even if there&#39;s not an opening where they work, they might know of an opening somewhere else.  It&#39;s also not as cold of an experience when they go in for an interview.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck with the hunt.

She always filled out the app right<br/>\nthere and then. Gives the employer a chance to see the person, make sure<br/>\nthey know what they are doing and also to observe them if they are<br/>\ninterested at all. My daughter made sure she was always appropriately<br/>\ndressed and polite and cheerful. She would ask questions about the job<br/>\ninstead of just handing the app in. Like when will someone review it or get<br/>\nback to her. Making it so they knew she really wanted the job and wanted to<br/>\nhear from them. She let them know right up front when she was available and<br/>\nwhat she would like to do. Even if there was no interview. A lot of times<br/>\neven people taking the application and not interviewing are in a postion to<br/>\nmake suggestions to the manager. She also always followed up on those apps<br/>\nshe turned in. Wanting to know if they made a decision or not and to keep<br/>\nher in mind if they would be hiring more people later. The first time she<br/>\nwent looking was in late Sept. early Oct. A slow time around here. She<br/>\nfollowed up again with new stores and also the ones from before in late Oct.<br/>\nearly Nov. when hiring for the holidays is needed. She got a great job at<br/>\nOld Navy and did so well they kept her and she&#39;s head cashier now. So if the<br/>\nperson seems like they really want the job and are eager and willing to<br/>\nwork, sometimes the timing is off. Tell your son to keep trying and not give<br/>\nup. Sometimes one can assume they won&#39;t get hired and well the attitude kind<br/>\n of follows you around. Tell him good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com\">http://www.homeschoolingtshirts.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85110659,"authorName":"Kimberly Fry","from":"Kimberly Fry &lt;kimberly_fry@...&gt;","profile":"kimberly_fry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[UnschoolingDiscussion] looking for work","postDate":"1062986647","msgId":80029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTA4MDIwNDA3LjkyMTYucW1haWxAd2ViODA0MDgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":80034,"prevInTime":80028,"nextInTime":80030,"topicId":80029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are numerous reasons one applicant is hired over another.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt sounds to me like you or he are picking up the applications and then you are filling them out and one of you returns the application.  If the positions require reading or the ability to write neatly and they suspect he did not fill out the application, that may be the reason why.  It would be better for him to go in *dressed for an interview* and fill out the application while there.  He may or may not get an interview at that time, but should dress as if he would.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe needs to look at the way he is dressing:  hair (cut and color), facial / tongue piercings, cleanliness, and neatness of clothing.  In the past we have not hired people for reasons based on those things.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCall your local Oklahoma Employment Security Commission office www.oesc.state.ok.us.  They have a one day class that shows you how to put together a resume (should be customized for each different application), how to interview (dress and attitude), how to look for jobs, how to make your past experiences relevant to possible opportunities, etc.  Some of the offices may also have a longer class that goes into more depth.  This is all free and they really can be helpful while he is looking.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope he finds what he is looking for soon!<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2856611,"authorName":"Judie C.
