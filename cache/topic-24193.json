NOT over and over, and preferably NOT when they&#39;re tired and grumpy.  <br/>\nWhen you&#39;re talking about what a body needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat do *you* do? Can you turn the tube off when you&#39;re tired? I went to  bed <br/>\nlast night at 10:00 while Duncan and Ben watched _The Invisible Man_. I was  <br/>\ntired, so I went to bed. I stated it out loud. &quot;I&#39;m pooped. I&#39;m going on to  <br/>\nbed.&quot; The more they see you do it, the more it makes sense to them. (Now, two  <br/>\nnights ago, I stayed up until 3:30. I&#39;m not very bedtime-oriented!  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, as a kid, to understand why children have to go to  bed  when <br/>\nthey&#39;re not tired but that parents/grown ups can stay up all  night---even when <br/>\nthey have to work the next day. Adults will say that they  just need some &quot;down <br/>\ntime&quot;---some time to themselves to unwind, and that&#39;s why  children need to go <br/>\nto bed. But that sends the wrong message. If children see  YOU retiring when <br/>\nyou&#39;re tired, they want to too. If they see you trying to stay  up as long as <br/>\nyou can, wellllll.......  Not to mention how they must feel  being &quot;gotten rid <br/>\nof&quot; so that their parents can watch tv &quot;in peace&quot;. OR that  they turn off <br/>\ntheir own biological needs because they&#39;re forcing themselves to  sleep when <br/>\nthey&#39;re not tired.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust like &quot;Math-out-loud&quot;, you can use &quot;Tired-out-loud&quot;. &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\n&quot;Hungry-out-loud&quot; is a good one too! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nTELL them how *you* have come to these conclusions.&quot;15% of 100 is 15, so  15% <br/>\nof 50 is 7.5.&quot; &quot;I worked so hard in the heat today and I got so little sleep  <br/>\nlast night. I&#39;m going to bed early. See you in the morning.&quot;  I&#39;m crabby  and <br/>\nhungry. I bet I need some protein; I haven&#39;t had any all day. I&#39;ll grab a  <br/>\npiece of cheese.&quot;  Out loud. Not directed at them, but at yourself.  They just <br/>\nget to hear your thinking.<br/>\n <br/>\nDo *you* go to bed when you&#39;re tired? Or will you stay up to watch the end  <br/>\nof a movie? Model the behavior you&#39;d like them to have. Works like a charm!  <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;  Well, I guess we all have to keep in mind that we&#39;re all  different. Some <br/>\nneed late night hours; some need 10 hours to feel best; some  need 4 hours! But <br/>\noverall.....<br/>\n <br/>\nRarely is anyone up past midnight at out house. If anyone is, it&#39;s  me! But <br/>\nthe boys often see me go to bed at 8:30 if I need to.

And I am stressed that I may be screwing them up for life! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny, when Alex finally came down this afternoon, fully dressed, at around 2pm, he <br/>\nsaid to me, &quot;I&#39;m never going to do that again.&quot;  I asked him why and he said he didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike getting up so late in the day.  However, his brother went swimming today at the <br/>\nneighbors house and Alex just decided to turn that TV back on again and he is still in <br/>\nfront of it now. (8pm)  I feel as though he just can&#39;t help himself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYa know, as I am &quot;writing&quot; this through, I am realizing it&#39;s the tv thing that bothers me <br/>\nso much.  For a long time, when they had a &quot;bedtime&quot;, all we asked was that they get <br/>\nready for bed and be in their rooms.  They could play quietly, read or what ever until <br/>\nthey were tired (they don&#39;t have TV&#39;s in their rooms).  This didn&#39;t bother me at all.  <br/>\nAnd often, Alex would be up past 11, but never until 4:30am which by the way, he <br/>\ntold me, is how late he stayed up last night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be counterproductive of me to ask that we/they come to an agreement about <br/>\na what is a reasonable time to turn off the TV?  It seems to me that it&#39;s the TV that <br/>\nkeeps them up beyond what their body may be trying to tell them.  I tried to explain <br/>\nto Alex that there will always be something on he will enjoy watching and that <br/>\nsometimes, you just need to walk away, or turn it off.   Do I facilitate this or trust that <br/>\nthey will come to it on their own? <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep talking everyone, it&#39;s helping lots.  My husband read these posts and I could see <br/>\nhim becoming more relaxed and calmer about it immediately.  And when he does, so <br/>\ncan I! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx, <br/>\nArlene, Oregon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Bedtime","postDate":"1090552508","msgId":96723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzIzMDMxNTA4LjM4OTkxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNkcGNodCtxczFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":96706,"nextInTopic":96724,"prevInTime":96722,"nextInTime":96724,"topicId":24193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"stancland  wrote: ***Everyone says that they will start listening to their bodies and sleep when they need to*** They will,  really.

I also wonder if my late night habits are part of the equation.  Is <br/>\nthere a right way and a wrong way to do this?  Should I make sure I go to bed at 10 or <br/>\n11 every night like their dad does, or does it even matter?  I have been able to point <br/>\nout to my 10 YO how his crankiness is related to not getting enough sleep.  He gets it <br/>\nand I don&#39;t worry about him as much anyway because he is such a pro-active, go <br/>\ngetter type of person and usually starts crawling out of his skin if he sits at the tv or <br/>\ncomputer too long.  He is also a natural &quot;early riser&quot; (like his dad), and I can see how <br/>\nhe could balance out in the future.  However, my 8 YO  can sit for hours upon hours <br/>\nat the tv, or a computer game.  I tend to fall asleep if it&#39;s tv, but if I&#39;m at the <br/>\ncomputer, I can stay up till 3 as well.  I used to feel bad about that until I read one of <br/>\nSandra&#39;s posts about the &quot;night-watchmen&quot; of the tribes.  I figure my ancestors were <br/>\nthe night-watchmen and dh&#39;s were the hunter/gatherers! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think I can guess what one person &lt;g&gt; might say, something like;  so <br/>\nwhat&#39;s wrong with staying up till 3 or 4am and and getting up at 2pm?  And if that is <br/>\nindeed the consensus,  then how &#39;bout helping me see what is &quot;right&quot; about it.  My <br/>\nhusband definitely feels that it is wrong because of his upbringing, and I just feel <br/>\nthat it&#39;s not helping to form good habits for college (if they choose) or the daytime <br/>\nworking world (if they choose). <br/>\n<br/>\nI probably have the answer to this issue in my heart somewhere, I just would like a <br/>\nlittle help and perspective for myself and my dh.  One nice thing dh said this morning <br/>\nabout their late night last night , &quot;what great childhood memories they&#39;ll have!&quot;  I <br/>\nthought that was a great way to look at it, but it&#39;s hard for us to maintain that <br/>\nattitude.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Rt95GYESFHYl1JnKBqwFo4X8Nsg2b88Q-IMUO8srGNHrw70msRnIXw6hlY5HdDlbEeSYpVpwFZk","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Bedtime","postDate":"999725669","msgId":24193,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2LjFiMjExOGNlLjI4YzdmNDY1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":96682,"prevInTime":24192,"nextInTime":24194,"topicId":24193,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 09/05/2001 12:45:43 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...

What do you folks think about having bedtimes? Do <br/>\n&gt; many of you find your children often open up and want to discuss everything <br/>\n&gt; personal to them at bedtime? When my children need sone individual time or <br/>\n&gt; something is heavy on their hearts, they ask to sleep with me. My husband <br/>\n&gt; is on the road most of the time so we usually end up having deep <br/>\n&gt; converstions late into the night with the older children.

Once we started homeschooling, that went out <br/>\nthe window. He usually goes to bed about the same time we do, because if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t get his bedtime reading. (We love him dearly, but we have <br/>\nto go to sleep.) Sometimes he has to get up early and is tired. He probably <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get as much sleep as he needs. But we get to spend lots of time <br/>\ntogether as a family, even the poor unfortunate soul who has to work in the <br/>\nmorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96994,"nextTopicId":96999}}
