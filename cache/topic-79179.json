If Congress works for us, and We the People give Congress permission to do the things they do, why can&#39;t I find a clause in the Constitution that allows the government to control our schools.  THINK, dammit!  Maybe - just maybe - the entire Department of Education is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.&quot;-Michael Badnarik - Libertarian Presidential Candidate 2004<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way before.  I was trying to think of a way to be more supportive of his &quot;computer learning&quot; so I think I might order him some new role playing games.  He will just fall on the floor from shock if &quot;MOM&quot; actually bought him some games.  &lt;big grin&gt;  But if it were anything else that he or my daughter were into I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go get it.  I do believe in providing resources within reason.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, what role playing games do your members of your family enjoy? Give me some titles that I can go get.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeana<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
