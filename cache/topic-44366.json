Neither one has said they&#39;ve missed it as of right now. And its been about 3 months.  I am going to have a violin, cello, piano, tin whistle, recorder and what ever else I can afford, available to them.  But it really has to be their decision.  They loved their music but I think they started because I really wanted them to do it, I grew up playing violin and piano but gave it up in college and regretted it.  So I was putting those feelings onto them. Living vicariously, ya know.  <br/>\nI just have to keep in mind that they are so young --  9, 7 and 5.  And if they want to be musicians I&#39;ll be excited about it, but if they don&#39;t that&#39;s OK too!<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\nKelli T<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-<br/>\n Judy wrote:I would, please.<br/>\ntrying to decide about the music lessons here, too.<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\nJudy Hain<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli Traaseth wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just ran across an essay in Deschooling Our Lives (which is a<br/>\n&gt; compilation of essays) which is titled Thinking about Play, Practice,<br/>\n&gt; and the Deschooling of Music by Mark Douglas.
