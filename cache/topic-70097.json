You<br/>\n  don&#39;t lecture and bore them to tears.

You don&#39;t punish and lose it and get angry and yell<br/>\n  or shame them. Those are sure ways to not have your child come to you in the<br/>\n  future.

When they&#39;ve told me, its usually becasue I ask about it too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the fact that I asked about it made them realize that I was not &quot;out of touch&quot;.  Nowadays, they just share things with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow to handle it?  Don&#39;t flip out and don&#39;t lecture (at least not right away LOL).  I let them talk, just like you would if it were your best friend doing something you didn&#39;t agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEN I tell them how I feel about it and give them real reasons why my advice is in their best interests.  And sometimes they will say &quot;ok mom, I don&#39;t want to hear anymore&quot;, and I stop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest started smoking we talked about it a lot.  I asked him if he would quit.  He said he would.  I asked if he was just telling me what I wanted to hear....he said &quot;probably&quot;.  so right there, we were honest with each other in a calm discussion where nobody was fooling themselves or each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the conversation continued over the past few months, we&#39;ve talked about smoking as a health concern, bad example, etc etc.  And our discussions have included drugs and alcohol.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve finally settled on knowing when you&#39;re hooked and how to avoid it if you *are* going to smoke.  And although I know he still smokes, he actually keeps track of how many he&#39;s had in what time period in an effort to not get hooked while he experiments with it.  (Whether or not this will actually work remains to be seen, but at least that is his intention).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also has made the conscious and responsible choice not to smoke in front of his younger sisters. Since I don&#39;t agree with his smoking, he doesn&#39;t smoke in front of me, but he doesn&#39;t keep it a secret.  And I don&#39;t buy him cigarettes because I would prefer that he quit.   We each know where we stand.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few days ago, my son and his friends asked me &quot;are you prepared for the future?&quot; and I looked at them.  And they whipped out packaged condoms and yelled &quot;we are!!&quot;.  My first response?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, you do realize that they only work if you wear them, right? LOL&quot;.  They all laughed.  But then we got to talking about whether condoms can have holes in them and that led to a conversation about VD and pregnancy and AIDS and Hepatitis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the reason they talked to me about it was because my first response did not pass judgement on them for having a condom in their pockets...but addressed the very real idea that they were contemplating sex, even at 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Yahoo!

My daughter is <br/>\n  only 2 and it will be many more years before my husband and I <br/>\n  have to face dating and boyfriends. I know that many of you on <br/>\n  this list have older kids so I wanted to ask you all. Do &quot;they&quot; <br/>\n  (meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want <br/>\n  regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;d like to respond to this, though I rarely post.  When I was very <br/>\n  young, say between 7 and 12 yo, I used to say with all honesty that <br/>\n  my Mom was my best friend. I felt immense love towards her.  I told <br/>\n  her everything.  She was a very permissive parent, meaning I <br/>\n  basically felt like I could do what I wanted, except for things like <br/>\n  staying up late (school the next day) and the like.  For a 10 yo <br/>\n  girl, though, I had it pretty good.   In Jr. High, I began taking <br/>\n  advantage of my mothers permissiveness, going places without her <br/>\n  knowledge, sneaking <br/>\n  cigarettes, tasting little sips of my best friends Dad&#39;d brandy.  I <br/>\n  was a good girl who was experimenting.  Once my mom found cigarettes <br/>\n  in my purse.  I lied and told them they were not mine.  She seemed to <br/>\n  believe me, and I didn&#39;t get in trouble, or even really talked to.  <br/>\n  From there, I figured that she trusted me so much that I really COULD <br/>\n  get away with anything, and that is where it began, by the time I was <br/>\n  13, I was no longer a virgin, had shoplifted, started sneaking out of <br/>\n  the house at night, been very drunk many <br/>\n  times, and began smoking pot.  I was hanging out with total losers, <br/>\n  while still managing to get mostly A&#39;s on my report card and <br/>\n  remaining first chair clarinet in Symphonic band.  When my mother did <br/>\n  find out about things that I had done, she&#39;d cry with me, tell me how <br/>\n  worried she was, and that she loved me.  She made no real moves to <br/>\n  HELP me get away from the negativity that I was breeeding. She didn&#39;t <br/>\n  know how she could.  My peers had won over the respect that i had for <br/>\n  my mom by the time I was 13.  My High school years were even <br/>\n  worse...My mom did the best she could.  She was working 2 jobs for <br/>\n  most of my life to keep the bills paid, trying her best to keep 2 <br/>\n  kids happy.  I am the one who betrayed that trust.  My &quot;friends&quot; had <br/>\n  such a pull over me that I could not be stopped. If only I could have <br/>\n  taken a step back and seen those peers for who they really <br/>\n  were...kids just as troubled and lost as i was, with NO guidance or <br/>\n  motivation to succeed.  A lot of those kids ended up in jail or <br/>\n  prison, some became <br/>\n  junkies, some just got pregnant early and had abortions. Some died. A <br/>\n  few made it out OK. I was one of the few.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess that is one of the reasons why I unschool.  I want to be <br/>\n  THERE <br/>\n  for my daughter (11), not just tell her that I&#39;ll be there when she <br/>\n  needs me.  She needs my physical presence in her life daily, not just <br/>\n  for a couple of hours at night.  My relationship with my DD is even <br/>\n  better than my early relationship with my Mom. I, too, am a <br/>\n  very permissive parent.  The difference it that I KNOW my daughters <br/>\n  beliefs on cigarettes, sex, drugs, stuck up people, risky behavior.  <br/>\n  I know them because we talk about them,alot, not just try to sweep <br/>\n  them <br/>\n  under the rug.  When my mom found out that I was having sex at 13 ( <br/>\n  after all, she did trust that my boyfriend and I were just in my room <br/>\n  behind closed doors TALKING) she rushed me to the gyno and put me on <br/>\n  the pill.  We had never before talked about the dangers or risks <br/>\n  associated with sex.  She trusted me without having a basis for doing <br/>\n  so.  She automatically assumed that I would not <br/>\n  do anything to hurt myself or others.  Unfortunately the &#39;friends&#39; <br/>\n  that I chose and the temptations surrounding those friendships were <br/>\n  way too alluring.  And the whole time, I just knew I could get away <br/>\n  with it.  I don&#39;t want my dd to think that she can &#39;get away with <br/>\n  anything&#39;.  I want her to make responsible choices.  She will not be <br/>\n  able to make those responsible choices if left completely to her own <br/>\n  devices, however.  There has to be a good solid foundation from which <br/>\n  she can grow.  That is why I unschool, and I just hope it works.  It <br/>\n  scares me to think that my dd could end up making the same mistakes <br/>\n  as I did.  My dd, however, has a much healthier self-esteem than I <br/>\n  did at her age. She has a strong sense of who she is and where she <br/>\n  wants her life to take her.  she is a very different young person <br/>\n  than I was. That being said,  I am making a concerted effort, every <br/>\n  day, to keep the lines of communication OPEN.  I will never just <br/>\n  ASSUME that she knows what my feelings are, or that I know what hers <br/>\n  are.  We talk about everything. And we do it often.  She is not <br/>\n  afraid to ask questions about &#39;sensitive&#39; subjects, and I give her <br/>\n  honest answers, not scare tactics or denial, not threats. Also, I <br/>\n  know who her friends are.  To me this is KEY.  My mother never had a <br/>\n  clue as to who the kids were that I was hanging out with. BTW, my mom <br/>\n  and I now have a very open relationship.  She knows all about my past <br/>\n  and my poor choices.  We have cried together several times as <br/>\n  I &#39;confessed&#39; the things that I had done in my youth.  We understand <br/>\n  each other, and she is, to this day, one of my best friends.  I&#39;m <br/>\n  just glad that I am still here to be able to say that.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
