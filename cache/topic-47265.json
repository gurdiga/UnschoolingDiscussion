I can&#39;t say I could add anything new.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as rules go, I&#39;m not sure one would really call them rules. Well <br/>\nmaybe we do have one, one big one. Keep the front door closed at all times! <br/>\nNot just because of the baby but mostly because of one cat that is dying to <br/>\nget out and two dogs who would just love to terrorize the neighborhood. <br/>\nBeing that one is a Beagle, we&#39;d never see her again. (you can see the dog <br/>\npost about hunting dogs!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, no rules. I guess things we&#39;ve just always done that no one <br/>\nquestions or has a problem with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 4 kids take showers every night. The only exception is when they swim in <br/>\nthe evening and see no point in getting wet again! Food comes and goes <br/>\naround this house so much it&#39;s no big deal. The 2 year old eats better on <br/>\nthe run so I&#39;m use to following through her path with the vacuum. (don&#39;t get <br/>\na mental pic of me chasing after her with the vacuum!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids generally eat in the dining room but mostly in the playroom. We use <br/>\nto eat in the kitchen too but I lost my table in there because of 2 dog <br/>\ncrates. My husband, myself and sometimes our oldest will eat in the living <br/>\nroom watching TV from one of my stack tables and sometimes on a movie night, <br/>\nwe&#39;ll have dessert in there. Teeth get brushed twice a day but only because <br/>\nthat&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done. I don&#39;t force and the kids don&#39;t complain, <br/>\nalthough I will ask if it was &quot;done yet.&quot; The playroom gets picked up every <br/>\nnight also, but again, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done. If the kids go to bed <br/>\nwith stuff on the floor, no big deal. I&#39;ll do it or just leave it and it <br/>\ngets done the next day. I guess some things have become a habit with us and <br/>\nwith the kids not giving us a hard time at all about it, it never became a <br/>\nbattle or a rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some people think it odd that none of our kids has ever slept with <br/>\nus. Point is, none of them have ever asked or had a problem sleeping in <br/>\ntheir own bed. I have asked them on occasion and they say &quot;No Thank You.&quot; I <br/>\ndo have good kids!!!

(If that IS an option, maybe go with <br/>\nthat for a while, and spend more time with your son.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me, if that kid were due back the next day, I would go for the taste <br/>\nof his own medicine approach, even though it sounds kind of cruel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not willing to aid and abet or enable my children to be mean to other <br/>\nchildren, especially those who are unable to get away from it, and certainly <br/>\nnot when they&#39;re guests in my home.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;example-     No  food out of the dining area<br/>\n                  bathing<br/>\n                  ect&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have a food rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids like to take showers.
