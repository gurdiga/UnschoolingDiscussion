Also she wants to race motorcycles. <br/>\nThen again she wants to ride like mommy and moans for a pony daily. I believe <br/>\nshe is right in the middle thanks to us. I was too though. My mother was <br/>\nsingle by the time I was 2 and had many an odd job for a woman esp. in the <br/>\n70s. The worst she says was being on the pipecrew. That is underground laying <br/>\nof pipe for water works.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I have noticed dd has many questions about gender typing though. She can <br/>\nnot understand why they don&#39;t make ScoobyDo (sp?) underwear for her. Some one <br/>\nsaid they do but I can&#39;t find them. She does notice and I explain. I have <br/>\nalso had to explain how 2 women and 2 men have children together.The other <br/>\nnight dh had to explain why most men do mot wear skirts but some do. Also why <br/>\nmen stand to pee is a huge topic.
