I know it has been a very hard road to find a <br/>\ndoctor that is good...both personally related, and medically..Actually we <br/>\nhave had such bad experiences with doctors it lead us to seek out educational <br/>\noppurtunities in healthcare..such as self care..and in the process we learned <br/>\nalot about taking our wellness into our own hands instead of leaving it to <br/>\nthe not so expert-Experts..who knows you best but yourself. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle,<br/>\n     I agree with you 100 % !  All the doctors wanted to do was put me on <br/>\npain medications and Prozac and Elavil (which are antidepressants).  I got <br/>\nvery frustrated with doctors after being poked and prodded for a couple of <br/>\nyears.  I tried to find a Natural Health Doctor, but when I called the State <br/>\nmedical people (because I wasn&#39;t having any luck), they told me that it was <br/>\nillegal in Indiana.  I decided then to study up on things myself.  I have <br/>\nread books from the library over the last few years and have taught myself <br/>\nnutrition and natural medicine.  I have changed my diet and excercise, plus I <br/>\nhave started using herbs and natural medicines.  I still have alot to learn <br/>\nthough!  But it fits in great with our unschooling lifestyle  :-).<br/>\n     We are putting in a large garden this year.  I started tomatoes and <br/>\ngreen peppers a couple of months ago indoors and will transplant them soon.  <br/>\nMy 14 yr. old started tomatoes, green peppers, and lettuce.  He wants his own <br/>\ngarden this year, so between the two of us, we will plant green beans, corn, <br/>\ncarrots, eggplant, turnips, green onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, <br/>\nlettuce, and some herbs.  We have also been busy planting apple trees, peach <br/>\ntrees, grape vines, blueberries, a crabapple tree, a silver birch, and 2 <br/>\ndifferent types of oak trees.  We are having a blast!  We have also started a <br/>\nflower garden.  I am really getting anxious to get it all started!<br/>\n      Well, I have already talked much longer than usual.

That is so true!  I love that line!  As I <br/>\nlook back on my journey thru infertility, I definitely see the pain: BUT-   I <br/>\nalso see the gift!  The things I have learned, the people I have met, the <br/>\nexperiences that I have allowed myself to be open to,  I really don&#39;t think <br/>\nwould have been part of my life if I hadn&#39;t had the pain of infertility to <br/>\npush me. I have learned so much- I am sooo patient now where I used not to <br/>\nbe, I never take one moment of my daughter&#39;s life for granted,  I  appreciate <br/>\nthe wonderfulness of my friends who have stood by me in times of grief,  I am <br/>\ndefinitely more sensitive to other people&#39;s pain,  and I am much less <br/>\njudgmental than I ever was.  And  these are only a handful of the gifts I <br/>\nhave received along with the infertility.  Although I would not have chosen <br/>\nthis for myself,  I would not trade the experiences I have had for anything.  <br/>\nI also realize that I would not be who I am today without this trial and I am <br/>\nvery glad to be who I am!     jackie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tamilooch@aol.com","from":"Tamilooch@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"4epiZz18KgBRd2R_Dv-b3ok91v-Pn8uRvnBRrVWsxgGOCeXoLeAjuyDxfbrRq1xIleIPY0JZDVc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Stars & gardens& Medicine","postDate":"954488734","msgId":7573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjLjMxYWVjYzYuMjYxNWIxOWVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7583,"prevInTime":7572,"nextInTime":7574,"topicId":7573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Michelle, I agree that you can make yourself sick  literally with all sorts of feelings .
