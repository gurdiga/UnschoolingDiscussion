I know with my 3 youngest, there was quite awhile when they were<br/>\nperfectly happy to play with each other when we went out to parks. They were<br/>\neven happy staying home at a younger age too. Your kids are still young and<br/>\na lot of times they don&#39;t have the desire for friends until they get older.<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until my 2 middle kids were around 7 and 8 that they wanted<br/>\nfriends. And even at that, they were perfectly happy with just one friend<br/>\ncoming over to the house. Now at 9 and 10, they enjoy our weekly get<br/>\ntogethers with a group. But they still aren&#39;t the kind of kids that want to<br/>\ngo out every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my youngest at 4 loves going out, even to the grocery store. So for her,<br/>\nshe takes quick trips out with me, her dad, my oldest daughter (19) and also<br/>\nwith her grandma. So it all depends on the child too and what they want and<br/>\nneed for them to be happy. Go with their needs and don&#39;t worry about what<br/>\nothers are doing. Your kids aren&#39;t their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Question about socialization","postDate":"1113054773","msgId":105241,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhhLjI0OWI1Mzg5LjJmODkzODM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":105238,"nextInTopic":105242,"prevInTime":105240,"nextInTime":105242,"topicId":105238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/2005 5:47:36 AM Mountain Daylight Time, elaina.morrison@gmail.com writes: -=-its usually just the 4 of us.

Occasionally one will last years, but longterm  friendships seem to do <br/>\nbetter when the people met in a place they had both  chosen to be.  As your kids <br/>\nget older they&#39;ll want to be doing and being  outside and with others, so let <br/>\ntheir desires and requests be more important  to you than your vague fears.  <br/>\nWhen they let you know they want out more,  then help them find outside people <br/>\nand experiences.<br/>\n <br/>\nAre there a few kids from the apartments you could invite over,  maybe?

If <br/>\nyou have three or four really good moments in a day, people  can go to bed <br/>\nhappier, sleep better, and wake up happy.  In as many small  ways as you can, <br/>\ncreate a peaceful and interesting nest for your children and  they&#39;ll leave it <br/>\nas happy, interesting people someday.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209727179,"authorName":"luv_my_three_kids","from":"&quot;luv_my_three_kids&quot; &lt;elaina.morrison@...&gt;","profile":"luv_my_three_kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Question about socialization","postDate":"1113029300","msgId":105238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzN3RyaytpdmIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":105241,"prevInTime":105237,"nextInTime":105239,"topicId":105238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sure this has been beaten to death.
