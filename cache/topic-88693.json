This just struck me today because dh is out of town again (he&#39;s been<br/>\nout of town about half the time this last year), and I have a 5 yo who is up<br/>\nat 7, and a 15 yo who&#39;s up until 12:30 or 1 am - and he&#39;s the most talkative<br/>\nthen.  So, if I didn&#39;t find time during the day to recharge (and<br/>\noccasionally nap), I&#39;d be exhausted and cranky by the time the oldest one is<br/>\nready to talk.

I&#39;ve always been a very<br/>\nfocused person - I could study for hours without a break, or practice flute,<br/>\nor program (depending on what I was doing in life &lt;grin&gt;), and doing things<br/>\nin little chunks of time following someone else&#39;s schedule was *very*<br/>\ndifficult for me to get used to.  I obviously did, at some point &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\nbecause it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore - in fact, I look on it as a privilege<br/>\nor a blessing.
