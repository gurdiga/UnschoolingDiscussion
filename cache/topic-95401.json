She realized that her only ideas about <br/>\nschool were from TV sitcoms and school bore little resemblence. Here are some of her <br/>\ncomments:<br/>\n<br/>\n--She never sees the principal in the hallways. In fact, most kids didn&#39;t even know the <br/>\nprincipal&#39;s name.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Kids don&#39;t laugh and do dramatic things in the hallways. They mostly walk and file <br/>\nthrough without much else going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Teachers are real people. They&#39;re not totally inflexible or rigid, nor are the scatter-<br/>\nbrained or incompetent. TV protrays them in these ways mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Most of school is uneventful, unlike every episode of the sitcom variety.<br/>\n<br/>\n--There aren&#39;t nearly the number of cool, team-oriented projects in school compared with <br/>\nTV.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also observed that kids in school are generally more incosiderate and selfish than her <br/>\nhomeschooled friends. She had to stand up for a boy in her French class who was <br/>\nconstantly teased for his accent and stood by stunned as a girl walked into the bathroom, <br/>\nsaw a ring left on the counter and picked it up to keep for herself. This girl asked if it <br/>\nbelonged to my daughter. When she said no, the girl said, &quot;Cool.

He knows I used to be a teacher so he talks <br/>\nabout &quot;big kid school&quot; sometimes too.   I imagine that if he ever expresses an <br/>\ninterest in the bus, we can arrange a ride on one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been talking alot (no- not alot, just sometimes when the subject of <br/>\nschool comes up) that some kids go to school and some don&#39;t.  He told me the <br/>\nother day that &quot;there are lots of ways to learn new stuff- you can read a book <br/>\nabout it, or learn stuff from TV, or from your mom, or at school.&quot;  I said- or <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re playing too, and he was like &quot;yeah, then too!&quot;.  (I was <br/>\nparticulary PROUD of him at this point!  and wondering why if a 4 yr old can figure that <br/>\nout, so many adults can&#39;t.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also read one picture book from the library about a little girl who is <br/>\nhomeschooled that talked about her day and what she does with her family at <br/>\nhome and in the community instead of going to school.  This was appropriate for <br/>\na young child- maybe as an alternate to all of the &quot;Kindergarten&quot; books that <br/>\nseem to be around now.  Of course, I can&#39;t remember the name of the book, but I <br/>\nwould guess there must be others out there written probably by and for <br/>\nhomeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of any picture books like this?  When I searched &quot;homeschool <br/>\nbooks&quot; in the library and online, I only seem to get books about <br/>\nhomeschooling for adults like The Unschooling Handbook, etc.<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95319,"nextTopicId":95600}}
