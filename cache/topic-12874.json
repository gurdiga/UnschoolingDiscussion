The rocking chair and pillow won<br/>\nand #2 son ended up with a large gash in his eyebrow.  Off to the ER we<br/>\nwent.  Now, to really understand what happened, you need to know that this<br/>\nchild was literally born a talking small adult.  His language skills<br/>\ntotally flabergasted us from the get go.  We get to the ER and of course we<br/>\nget the looks because hubby was filling out the forms and son is not his. <br/>\nThat is when eyebrows started raising.  The nurse asked son what had<br/>\nhappened and he told her.  Raised eyebrows we weren&#39;t suppose to see.  Then<br/>\nthe doc asked.  Then they made the mistake of deciding to do the keep<br/>\nquestioning and we&#39;ll get the answer we want routine.  WRONG!  Son says,<br/>\nvery patiently, &quot;Please finish my eye.&quot;  Doc kinda looked shocked and<br/>\nfinished the stitching job.  When he was done, he decided to start the quiz<br/>\nagain.  Son asked, very politely, &quot;Could you please help me down.&quot;  The<br/>\nnurse lifts him off the gurney.  Doc starts to ask again.  Son puts his<br/>\nhands on his hips and says, &quot;I told you and I don&#39;t lie.&quot;  Then he turned<br/>\nto me and said with that accusing voice, &quot;Mummy, you said you had to be<br/>\nsmart to be a doctor.&quot;  He grabbed hubby&#39;s hand, &quot;I wanna go home, the<br/>\npeople here aren&#39;t nice like Mummy said.&quot;  As we were leaving, we overheard<br/>\nthe doctor say to the nurse, &quot;Next time get your facts straight!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Cathie _ &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cathie_98@...\">cathie_98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom]Was Differences <br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, September 06, 2000 2:33 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lee, you poor thing!

For a moment there I thought I was<br/>\nlistening to the crickets sing in a crowded theatre. :-) Just call me Daffy<br/>\nDuck!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways I think your situation was scarier than mine.  The police<br/>\nofficer was pretty understanding after he saw I was with a couple teachers.<br/>\nHe still had to make that report, though, and he told me so. It&#39;s a little<br/>\ndifferent when a lay person reports v.s. a professional, like a teacher or<br/>\ndoctor.  CPS takes those calls much more seriously-they may be required to<br/>\ninvestigate them by law.  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, facing down a doctor must have been pretty intimidating.  If you<br/>\nask me-doctors are scary people anyway.  I&#39;ve only had one good doctor in my<br/>\nentire life, and I had to move away. (Sorry-baggage!  I&#39;ve been dealing with<br/>\na lot of baggage lately-but I promise not to open the suitcase! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I fully expected a knock on my door the next morning,heck, by the look and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sound of that kid, I&#39;d have probably turned us in, too!

What a scary night you must<br/>\nhave spent.  I bet you tossed and turned a bit in your sleep! Your son was<br/>\nobviously reacting to the authority of the white coat-there are always so<br/>\nmany actions and reactions in interpersonal situations that I think to chart<br/>\na simple &quot;hello&quot; between two people is not simple at all. And this is<br/>\nprecisely why I think it&#39;s wise to exercise great caution and careful<br/>\njudgement before calling CPS or the police on anybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, my experience still makes me angry, even though it happened 3<br/>\nyears ago. I hope to someday reach the status of laughing it off as you<br/>\nhave, but I get nervous when I think about it too much (which I&#39;m going to<br/>\nstop doing right now! ;-0).
