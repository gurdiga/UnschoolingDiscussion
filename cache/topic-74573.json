My son will be six <br/>\nnext month and still sucks his thumb.  He also has a favorite stuffed <br/>\nanimal (Curious George!) that he needs to have in order to fall <br/>\nasleep.  Today he lost George and had an incredibly hard time falling <br/>\nasleep.  We searched high and low for George and didn&#39;t find him.  He <br/>\nloses George fairly often, although we&#39;re usually able to find him <br/>\nbefore bed.  I&#39;ve suggested that he might like to keep George on his <br/>\nbed in order to keep him safe, but he said he would miss him too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I do anything about it?  I broke my daughter of thumb sucking <br/>\nby using hot sauce, but my parenting style has so drastically changed <br/>\nsince then.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to do that to him!    <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard stories about kids still sucking thumbs when they&#39;re <br/>\nteens.  That just doesn&#39;t seem ok to me.  At what point do you do <br/>\nsomething about it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73984,"nextTopicId":74546}}
