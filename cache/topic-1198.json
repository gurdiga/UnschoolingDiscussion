It didn&#39;t seem vary imaginative of what the<br/>\n&gt;future could be. Smaller classes, better teachers, better technology - just<br/>\n&gt;what we keep hearing today is needed to improve schools. Deep Space Nine<br/>\n </span></blockquote>had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;several episodes which showed this kind of school. When we started out, we<br/>\n&gt;went through the debate of public school vs private school. As we looked at<br/>\n&gt;different schools in the area, we saw that  many of the private schools<br/>\n </span></blockquote>were<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;just better versions of school, and we realized that we didn&#39;t want just a<br/>\n&gt;better school, we wanted something that was not school at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I like the Voyager version better. The one little girl born onboard learns<br/>\n&gt;more through mentoring/apprentice relationships. She is treated with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>respect<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and performs real duties. If she has an interest in something, she can<br/>\n&gt;pursue it through the ship&#39;s computer or through access to the people who<br/>\n&gt;have interest in that subject matter. She is shown learning from various<br/>\n&gt;people she comes in contact with and by doing real things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, finally someone who agrees with me!! I feel the exact same way about<br/>\nthis, but I didn&#39;t know others noticed the way Naomi learned the way I do.<br/>\nStar Trek is a little slow to catch onto society changes sometimes, but they<br/>\nare doing a very good job with the character or Naomi and how she learns.<br/>\nShe seems a much more *real* child to me than the children on TNG were.
