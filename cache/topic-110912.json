People called me <br/>\non that on the list, which helped me realize that I was dipping down <br/>\ninto a bit of a seasonal depression.  (I put a lot of effort into <br/>\npreventative steps this year, because I do tend to feel &quot;dark&quot; in the <br/>\ndark part of the year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s an evening person.  Even when he wakes up earlier, he&#39;s not <br/>\nfired up and happy to do things in the first couple hours that he&#39;s up.  <br/>\nIt took me awhile to realize that he is more enthusiastic later in the <br/>\nday.  This can be tricky as I&#39;m peppy from 7am to 11am-ish, and I tended <br/>\nto slowly melt and stop offering things as the day went on.  (But one of <br/>\nour most fun outings last year was an evening movie outdoors in the park.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother difference between my son and me is that I&#39;m less content <br/>\nstaying home than he is. (I can only read email for so long!&lt;g&gt;)  One <br/>\nway I can deal with that is to go out by myself when it is feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can you offer the kids that you KNOW they wouldn&#39;t turn down?  My <br/>\nson went through one age when it seemed like the only place he wanted to <br/>\ngo was the toy store.  We went there a lot, but didn&#39;t always make a <br/>\npurchase.  Even when it seemed like he didn&#39;t want to go out at all, he <br/>\nwas always positive about going to parkday with friends and going to <br/>\nfriends houses.  I&#39;ve sometimes said that we don&#39;t go to many museums, <br/>\nbut the last time I offered my son a trip to the Monterey Aquarium he <br/>\nliterally jumped for joy, performing a fairly spectacular vertical <br/>\nmaneuver.  (This would be at least our 15th trip in 10 years.  Depth is <br/>\nmore appealing than breadth to some people.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(The dynamics are different if your kids want different things and are <br/>\ncompeting rather than trying to cooperate.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch out for the potential trap of offering outings that are <br/>\n&quot;improving&quot; or &quot;educational&quot; or that advance an agenda of your own.  (I <br/>\nlike errands that take me past the fabric store -- NOT a good way to <br/>\nreinforce my son&#39;s enjoyment of the day. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS  My brother&#39;s start-up company has an events database for the San <br/>\nFrancisco Bay Area that is searchable, and people in my neck of the <br/>\nwoods can use it for outing ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zvents.com\">http://www.zvents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231302054,"authorName":"Kimberly Goza","from":"Kimberly Goza &lt;kimberly.goza@...&gt;","profile":"activatedstorytellers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] strewing ideas?","postDate":"1136130371","msgId":110949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhNzQzYzYxMDYwMTAxMDc0Nm1lZjRjYjQ0eGYwOGQ4ZTU3NGI1YWJmODBAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjMwMjIxNzUxLjQ1ODU5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQzQjU5MzQzLjgwMzA1MDNAZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDIwMDUxMjMwMjIxNzUxLjQ1ODU5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgxMTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110948,"nextInTopic":110950,"prevInTime":110948,"nextInTime":110950,"topicId":110912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jumping in on this thread late.

So, maybe we&#39;ll give that a go and do these interesting things to keep us motivated (I&#39;m a night owl too when I&quot;m not teaching, so getting up early is rough for me too!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Antique shops, vintage clothing stores, art galleries and hobby shops are<br/>\n  free.  Take a camera to the vintage clothing store, try the clothes, take<br/>\n  pictures.  <br/>\n  Sit, read and browse at a book store or linger in the coffee shop. (with<br/>\n  cookies) <br/>\n  If you go to six different places in one afternoon you don&#39;t have to stay<br/>\n  at any one place long enough for it to become boring. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  These are great ideas. Do you really manage 6??  Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Ethnic restaurants, for a treat, when you can afford it, -maybe just<br/>\n  order the appetizers- are so fun because you get the atmosphere along<br/>\n  with the food.   And when you make different foods at home you could rent<br/>\n  corresponding movies to help supply atmosphere for your meal.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  LOL, yes, the appetizers, and that would be about it.  My kids will probably turn their noses up.  But this is something I&#39;d love to do just for fun.  We&#39;ll do it &quot;just for fun&quot; and not to eat when we&#39;re hungry, so that nobody feels like they are getting jipped out of a real meal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Volunteer at the animal shelter one or two mornings a week, if your heart<br/>\n  can take it. <br/>\n  Become a foster parent to a puppy from the pound? &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh my, no way.  I wanted to do this last year.  But I just can&#39;t see all those animals in cages.  HOWEVER.....We raised a litter of puppies this year, which was fun.  We have two left and I guess we&#39;re keeping them (yay!!)    <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;Dylan is lately interested in refinishing furniture and is just starting<br/>\n  on a little rocker.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe we could find something like that at a thrift store and do it.  I&#39;ll check.  My girls would absolutely love that idea.  In fact, maybe we&#39;ll do that today.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb, I love your ideas!  I am downloading different kinds of music to play for when the kids get up in the mornings.  I figure maybe we&#39;ll hit upon something that sparks an interest.  I know it sparks mine!<br/>\n  I have one daughter that wants to go to France, so maybe I&#39;ll expand on that a little bit too.<br/>\n  Kristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Graduate school education  High school education  Home school education  <br/>\n        Middle school education  New york school education  School education in california  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

I found some interseting stuff that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of (how DO I get stuck in such ruts???).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I wrote down a few for each month.  I want to take the kids on a tour through the Harely Davidson plant in York.  And the Farm Show is coming up, which I had forgotten about.  I never liked the farm show because its so dang crowded.  But thinking of it in a new light (all the opportunities) makes me like it more.  You have to pay for the farm show, but I don&#39;t think its a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the National Civil War museum.  I think its a bit pricey though so that might have to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd  I came across a contest to build a rollercoaster using rollercoaster tycoon.  If your rollercoaster is chosen to be built, you win 100,000 for college.  WOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen as I was looking through the schedule for Discovery Theater in Wash DC, I came across performers that are called &quot;Panmasters&quot; I think.  They do a steel drum routine, and they will be in PA in August I think at the Musikfest.  We will go see them.  I think that will be awesome.  They are also having a Pan Jamboree in May.  I don&#39;t know where though, so I have to wait and find out.  I&#39;d really like to go to that because it will be Steel drummers from all over NY, Baltimore, and Washington DC.  That ought to really be something to see!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the first summer that I won&#39;t be working weekends, so I&#39;ll be able to take the kids to more festivals, etc.  but thats a few months from now.  So, I&#39;ll keep looking for stuff for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sanguinegirl83@...\">Sanguinegirl83@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, December 31, 2005 1:52 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] strewing ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 12/30/2005 9:04:31 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gehrkes@...\">gehrkes@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; There is a  membership in<br/>\n  &gt; Ohio that covers childrens museums and zoos..

You know what?  maybe we&#39;ll just do that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids&#39; current interests are burning cd&#39;s (we just got a new burner, the other one didn&#39;t work).  I&#39;ve been looking for legal websites to use for downloading.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also do a LOT with IM and Xanga.  Sometimes neopets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND...they love food.  Maybe I&#39;ll capitalize on that by having us try out different kinds of foods and different kinds of cooking based on different countries/cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have friends overnight routinely.  Sometimes I buy new things to eat for breakfast, like cinamon rolls, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I&#39;m trying to download pan flute music so I can play it during the day.  I want to hear all kinds of music.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love movies, so I will check out the one you mentioned, sounds like a good one!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of museums etc around here, but at the moment many of them cost more money than I have.
