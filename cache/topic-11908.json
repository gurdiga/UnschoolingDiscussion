Mine seems to be<br/>\ntriggered by stress and in college I had it around my eyes so bad that<br/>\nthey<br/>\nwould swell shut. There were a lot of times where I couldn&#39;t wear<br/>\ncontacts<br/>\nand I have never been able to wear eye makeup without a lot if<br/>\nirritation.<br/>\n(By the way, I can wear NICOLE MILLER and for the last year have even<br/>\nbeen<br/>\nwearing mascara and eye liner without any allergic reactions!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the eczema on my face, hands, and arms would come and go I could<br/>\nnever get rid of a patch of it on my neck and it has been there for<br/>\nalmost<br/>\n10 years! (I am 32.) Before going to Convention 2000 I swam in the ocean<br/>\ntwice<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t stay in very long because the eczema on my neck stung so<br/>\nbadly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile strolling through the product store at Convention I put some<br/>\nMoistursil on my eczema and it immediately felt better and smoother. I<br/>\nwent<br/>\nand bought products and they forgot to put the Moistursil in my bag. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get to use it again that day but even after going to the pool and<br/>\nshowering it still felt better the next day. I brought my receipt back<br/>\nand<br/>\nthey gave me the Moistursil no questions asked. By Sunday the eczema on<br/>\nmy<br/>\nneck was COMPLETELY GONE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve now been home from Convention for a few days and I can&#39;t believe<br/>\nhow<br/>\nthis <br/>\none little product has made me feel better, look better, and has really<br/>\nchanged my life. My passion is scuba diving and now<br/>\nI can enjoy it without pain and discomfort. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the power to change other peoples lives in so many positive ways <br/>\njust by sharing from our heart what Melaleuca means to us.
