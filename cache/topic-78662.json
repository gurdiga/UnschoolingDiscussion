Today we went to the swimming pool. Normally we don&#39;t go when school is out because I have kids sensitive to noise, lights, and crowds. They are also sensitive to the teasing, bullying that can happen with strangers. <br/>\nWe were in line for a ride on a water toy and two kids kept pushing in front of us and others. My kids and niece told them to stop then after numerous times of being ignored I stepped in. After arguing with me they finally backed down. But they were angry so they made quiet subtle remarks about my daughters weight. They were brother and sister and kept pushing each other, yelling and fighting. This became to much for my daughter(13) so she moved away. Mt son was having an unforeseen hypoglycaemic moment and was bursting into tears easily so I decided to get him out and take him home and come back for the others later. He is also overweight and this has started to be noticed by others only recently(he is 11). In the changeroom some boys from the YMCA day program came in and started laughing at him because he was naked. He held it together until we got in the car.This was painful and sad for both of us and sometimes I just get exhausted feeling from his moments of not coping well and then to have this on top of it really hit me hard today. When I went back to pick up the other kids my other son had to leave in his swim gear cause his shoes and clothes were taken. Yikes!!! Having highly sensitive children is hard enough, being an unschooler already leaves me feeling different and sometimes isolated and then all this. I am sure tomorrow will look better but today was really a bummer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen<br/>\nTim and Maureen Thomas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stillwaters.ca\">http://www.stillwaters.ca</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78731,"nextTopicId":78711}}
