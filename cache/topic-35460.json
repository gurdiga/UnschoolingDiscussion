I just joined the group yesterday and have already gotten so <br/>\nmuch out of the posts. I wanted to jump in here and introduce myself, because <br/>\nthe comment this poster made describes what I&#39;m trying to get through right <br/>\nnow. We&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 3 years. I have a son (who will be 8 <br/>\nin a couple of weeks) and an almost 3 year old daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on this list before (a long time ago) and ended up unsubbing <br/>\nbecause I just couldn&#39;t get past my &quot;schoolish&quot; mentality, even though I <br/>\nreally wanted to. A few weeks ago, I ordered a boxed curriculum, I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat came over me and I regretted it immediately. We got the box full of <br/>\nworkbooks etc at the beginning of last week. I made a little schedule and we <br/>\ngot started. It was terrible!! It was so boring and unnatural! But at the <br/>\nsame time it was wonderful because I finally realized that the &quot;schoolish&quot; <br/>\nway is the wrong way for us! The whole lot of stuff has been put up for sale <br/>\nand I can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s gone. Looking at the stacks of workbooks makes me <br/>\nrealize how ridiculous I have been in the search for the right way for my fa<br/>\nmily to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so excited to have found this list again! I am eager to learn from your <br/>\nexamples how to relax and let go. I welcome the opinions (and I&#39;ve read the <br/>\narchives, lol, so I know how that can go)!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know you all better!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nDena in Florida<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35447,"nextTopicId":35346}}
