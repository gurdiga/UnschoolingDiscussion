It&#39;s about researchers who showed members of an Amazon  <br/>\ntribe (wait... they &quot;tested them&quot; with) pictures of shapes and asked  <br/>\nthem which was was &#39;ugly&#39; (meaning different, and they could&#39;ve said  <br/>\ndifferent), and showed them something else that mapped an area, with  <br/>\nshapes, and asked a question about which was different.  So by that  <br/>\ntest they&#39;re claiming the natives &quot;know geometry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response is below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n========================<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livescience.com/othernews/060119_amazon_math.html\">http://www.livescience.com/othernews/060119_amazon_math.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s interesting, and says more about the researchers than about  <br/>\nthe native tribe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they did had to do with language and mapping, with  <br/>\ncorrespondence.  Yet because there were shapes involved they wanted  <br/>\nto call it geometry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have been more impressed if they had themselves figured out  <br/>\nin the tribe&#39;s language and culture how they use relationships and  <br/>\nangles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the study helps unschoolers and the promotion of natural learning  <br/>\nthat&#39;s great, and it&#39;s interesting, but it&#39;s not a very good study as  <br/>\nmath goes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for bringing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here wants more ideas about mathematical concepts in  <br/>\nnatural ways, or if you have more things to add when you&#39;ve looked,  <br/>\nhere:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/math\">http://sandradodd.com/math</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure to follow the link to Pam Sorooshian&#39;s page.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111252,"nextTopicId":111358}}
