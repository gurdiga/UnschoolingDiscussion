But it&#39;s a solution with it&#39;s own flaws. Learning &quot;because it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant to your future&quot; is hard and time consuming and is designed more to<br/>\nprovide feedback that the things were taught not that they were learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is it you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss?

Mainly because schools teach it<br/>\nthat way: isolated and out of context. The only way to learn math seems to<br/>\nbe to do a gazillion math problems. The only way to learn science seems to<br/>\nbe to memorize all the answers scientists have discovered. The only way to<br/>\nlearn history is to start at the beginning and go through all the<br/>\n&quot;important&quot; events to present day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we learn by living life, all that stuff becomes tools that we pick<br/>\nup and use for the purpose intended. There&#39;s no reason not to use (and learn<br/>\nas a side effect) math when there are games and stuff to spend allowance on<br/>\nand things to figure out. There&#39;s no reason not to use science when the<br/>\nworld is full of wonderous things and a child is filled with curiosity. (It<br/>\nwon&#39;t look like school science. It will look like -- and *be* -- real<br/>\nscience: observing and asking questions and theorizing what could be the<br/>\ncause.) There&#39;s no reason to not use history when the past is full of<br/>\nstories of interesting people and places and events.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also have to disagree with the TV watching.  NO CHILD, unschooled,<br/>\n&gt; homeschooled, public schooled, or anything else can benefit from watching ALL<br/>\n&gt; the TV they want!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if you said &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from reading ALL the books they<br/>\nwant!!&quot; or &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from playing ALL the games they want!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s assuming (or extrapolating from some different situation) that when<br/>\nchildren are allowed all the TV they want, they&#39;ll do little else, that<br/>\nthey&#39;ll spend years watching indescriminately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would they?<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* TV is controlled and doled out like a prize, then they&#39;ll watch garbage<br/>\njust because TV is so precious. *If* they are in school, they&#39;ll often watch<br/>\nTV as a way of depressurizing after school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids, given free access to TV have neither of those reasons for<br/>\nwatching TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry folks, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But are you basing what you say on your opinion of what will happen or on<br/>\npersonal knowledge of allowing your kids for many months to watch as much TV<br/>\nas they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There&#39;s far too much GARBAGE on TV to have a positive influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think children would choose deliberately to watch garbage? Do our<br/>\ntastes need to be molded by experts in what is good in order to choose what<br/>\nis good? Or can our kids develop their own sense of what is good and bad by<br/>\nexperiencing good and bad and deciding from their experience what is useful<br/>\nto them and what is not?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are children such slaves to a need to be entertained that they&#39;d choose<br/>\ngarbge over going somewhere or doing something they enjoy with mom?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; THere is no requirement of<br/>\n&gt; thinking for a child when they watch hours of TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe if children feel overloaded and are choosing TV as a way to turn off<br/>\nthe pressures they have no control over. (As schooled kids might.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since my daughter absorbes tons of stuff -- things that relate to her<br/>\nworld as well as the adult world -- then I&#39;d say she&#39;s doing a great deal of<br/>\nthinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t care how *Good* the<br/>\n&gt; programs are.  Children develop mentally by THINKING, using their imagination,<br/>\n&gt; creativity!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And many children find TV a great fodder for thinking, imagination and<br/>\ncreativity. Pokemon has branched off into a huge number of things that<br/>\nrelate to adult knowledge and adult skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think we also need to recognize the value of their needs as the people<br/>\nthey are right now. Memorizing all 251 Pokemon isn&#39;t something she&#39;ll use<br/>\nmuch as an adult -- though it exercises skills she&#39;ll use as an adult -- but<br/>\nit&#39;s something that&#39;s important to the person she is right now. And feeding<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important to her right now is what will help her become the person<br/>\nshe will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let the child<br/>\n&gt; sit in front of the TV hours on end???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because there&#39;s more than passively watching involved in PS. There&#39;s being<br/>\nthere by force, listening to and doing something they don&#39;t care to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child watching TV is choosing what appeals to him, what *he* finds useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And I don&#39;t believe they are watching<br/>\n&gt; *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time.  Children learn from TV good and bad.<br/>\n&gt; Are these parents who allow unlimited TV being selective about what they<br/>\n&gt; watch?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a need to. Children are self-selective. My daughter may choose<br/>\nthings that I wouldn&#39;t choose for her, but she has needs that are different<br/>\nthan mine. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s getting out of Squarebob Spongepants, but<br/>\nthe enthusiasm with which she watches it and then replays verbally for me<br/>\nall the episodes, means there&#39;s something important to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe won&#39;t watch anything that&#39;s scary or sexual any more than she&#39;d watch a<br/>\npolitical talk show. Her world is divided into useful to her and not useful<br/>\nto her rather than good and forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am selective about what *I* watch. There are R movies that we choose to<br/>\nwatch when she isn&#39;t there or has other things to occupy her. We don&#39;t force<br/>\nher to choose between watching an adult movie with us vs being alone. But<br/>\ngiven full freedom to choose anything she wants, she doesn&#39;t choose the<br/>\nthings I would protect her from anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58541700,"authorName":"Betty Holder","from":"&quot;Betty Holder&quot; &lt;ninnyridge03@...&gt;","profile":"ninnyridge03","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question & disagreement","postDate":"1021302633","msgId":36997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmQwMWMxZmE5MCQ1NzE0Y2M2MCQ1MjlhZDU0M0BqMXUxdTI+","referencesHeader":"PDFiYS5jZjlhYTYuMmExMDVlNTlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37000,"prevInTime":36996,"nextInTime":36998,"topicId":36997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I let them watch what they want, but, we discuss<br/>\n&gt; what they watch  A LOT. This is sort of like the book discussion thing.<br/>\n&gt; We realized, in our discussing, that we watch tv two ways - sometimes we<br/>\n&gt; sit and watch the show, and sometimes we just want the background noise<br/>\n&gt; while we are doing something else, like ironing or folding laundry or<br/>\n&gt; cleaning our room or cooking or whatever. My 8 yo dd complained that<br/>\n&gt; during a certain time when she like the tv on for background noise,<br/>\n&gt; there was nothing on worth watching (inc. pbs, nick, cartoon, etc.) I<br/>\n&gt; suggested History, Discovery, or Animal Planet. As an example, we put on<br/>\n&gt; History channel to see what was on, and there was one of those<br/>\n&gt; archaeology type programs and they were trying to find some ancient<br/>\n&gt; civilization. She found that very interesting. My other dd will<br/>\n&gt; generally go with animal planet.  Yeah, there&#39;s junk on tv, but there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; an awful lot of good stuff too. First, you have to know where it is, and<br/>\n&gt; second, discuss with them how to discern what is and isn&#39;t good tv. The<br/>\n&gt; girls got in a discussion one time about some show or other, and they<br/>\n&gt; were disagreeing whether or not it was a worthwhile show. They<br/>\n&gt; eventually concluded that the show glorified the type of girl-cliques in<br/>\n&gt; schools that decide who is in and who is not. So they chose not to watch<br/>\n&gt; it anymore. I just listened, and was not involved in the discussion at<br/>\n&gt; all. For myself, A&E or CNN are my &quot;noise&quot; channels, and as for other<br/>\n&gt; stuff, we tape what interests us and watch it later. We are currently<br/>\n&gt; watching shows from Feb. We only watch one at night, if that, so it<br/>\n&gt; takes a while to see the ones that interest us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An ongoing discussion we have is to find &quot;pro-homeschooling&quot; kid shows.<br/>\n&gt; This began when older dd complained that there were never any<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers on tv. So we have started an informal list of shows and<br/>\n&gt; movies that are homeschool-friendly. So far we have the Wild<br/>\n&gt; Thornberrys, Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang (his kids do go to school, when<br/>\n&gt; they feel like it, and this is just fine with him). There&#39;s any show<br/>\n&gt; that takes place before the advent of public schools, Swiss Family<br/>\n&gt; Robinson, and others (can&#39;t think of them just now, but you get the<br/>\n&gt; idea).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; second, although I went to ps, I think I&#39;ve always been an unschooler at<br/>\n&gt; heart. In second grade, I was allowed to read ahead, read tons on my<br/>\n&gt; own, was reading Nancy Drew books by then. I spent a lot of time in the<br/>\n&gt; woods near our home investigating and learning. My grades almost always<br/>\n&gt; reflected my level of interest - I never could do busy work, and tended<br/>\n&gt; to ignore stuff that was a waste of my time (this drove mom and many<br/>\n&gt; teachers nuts). I remember reading John Holt in college and thinking it<br/>\n&gt; was good stuff. As a teacher, I had a very student-centered, busy, noisy<br/>\n&gt; classroom - this drove other teachers nuts - and this was math and<br/>\n&gt; computer courses in high school. In college I took classes that<br/>\n&gt; interested me, sometimes taking senior level classes to meet group<br/>\n&gt; requirements instead of the easy entry level ones. I know that the stuff<br/>\n&gt; from my education/unedcuation that was worthwhile was not the<br/>\n&gt; workbook/tests/follow the herd stuff, but the unschooling kind of things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would think that many of us who are unschooler parents would have<br/>\n&gt; similar stories and experiences of never quite buying into the whole ps<br/>\n&gt; follow the herd, do what you&#39;re told, think what you&#39;re told. Now we<br/>\n&gt; just get to do it. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; peace,<br/>\n&gt; Susan Marie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Monday, May 13, 2002, at 11:10 AM, Betty Holder wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Unschooling is way outside of school.&lt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering, were any of the parents who are on this list<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooled as children??

I let them watch what they want, but, we discuss <br/>\nwhat they watch  A LOT. This is sort of like the book discussion thing. <br/>\nWe realized, in our discussing, that we watch tv two ways - sometimes we <br/>\nsit and watch the show, and sometimes we just want the background noise <br/>\nwhile we are doing something else, like ironing or folding laundry or <br/>\ncleaning our room or cooking or whatever. My 8 yo dd complained that <br/>\nduring a certain time when she like the tv on for background noise, <br/>\nthere was nothing on worth watching (inc. pbs, nick, cartoon, etc.) I <br/>\nsuggested History, Discovery, or Animal Planet. As an example, we put on <br/>\nHistory channel to see what was on, and there was one of those <br/>\narchaeology type programs and they were trying to find some ancient <br/>\ncivilization. She found that very interesting. My other dd will <br/>\ngenerally go with animal planet.  Yeah, there&#39;s junk on tv, but there&#39;s <br/>\nan awful lot of good stuff too. First, you have to know where it is, and <br/>\nsecond, discuss with them how to discern what is and isn&#39;t good tv. The <br/>\ngirls got in a discussion one time about some show or other, and they <br/>\nwere disagreeing whether or not it was a worthwhile show. They <br/>\neventually concluded that the show glorified the type of girl-cliques in <br/>\nschools that decide who is in and who is not. So they chose not to watch <br/>\nit anymore. I just listened, and was not involved in the discussion at <br/>\nall. For myself, A&E or CNN are my &quot;noise&quot; channels, and as for other <br/>\nstuff, we tape what interests us and watch it later. We are currently <br/>\nwatching shows from Feb. We only watch one at night, if that, so it <br/>\ntakes a while to see the ones that interest us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn ongoing discussion we have is to find &quot;pro-homeschooling&quot; kid shows. <br/>\nThis began when older dd complained that there were never any <br/>\nhomeschoolers on tv. So we have started an informal list of shows and <br/>\nmovies that are homeschool-friendly. So far we have the Wild <br/>\nThornberrys, Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang (his kids do go to school, when <br/>\nthey feel like it, and this is just fine with him). There&#39;s any show <br/>\nthat takes place before the advent of public schools, Swiss Family <br/>\nRobinson, and others (can&#39;t think of them just now, but you get the <br/>\nidea).<br/>\n<br/>\nsecond, although I went to ps, I think I&#39;ve always been an unschooler at <br/>\nheart. In second grade, I was allowed to read ahead, read tons on my <br/>\nown, was reading Nancy Drew books by then. I spent a lot of time in the <br/>\nwoods near our home investigating and learning. My grades almost always <br/>\nreflected my level of interest - I never could do busy work, and tended <br/>\nto ignore stuff that was a waste of my time (this drove mom and many <br/>\nteachers nuts). I remember reading John Holt in college and thinking it <br/>\nwas good stuff. As a teacher, I had a very student-centered, busy, noisy <br/>\nclassroom - this drove other teachers nuts - and this was math and <br/>\ncomputer courses in high school. In college I took classes that <br/>\ninterested me, sometimes taking senior level classes to meet group <br/>\nrequirements instead of the easy entry level ones. I know that the stuff <br/>\nfrom my education/unedcuation that was worthwhile was not the <br/>\nworkbook/tests/follow the herd stuff, but the unschooling kind of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would think that many of us who are unschooler parents would have <br/>\nsimilar stories and experiences of never quite buying into the whole ps <br/>\nfollow the herd, do what you&#39;re told, think what you&#39;re told. Now we <br/>\njust get to do it. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nSusan Marie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, May 13, 2002, at 11:10 AM, Betty Holder wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;Unschooling is way outside of school.&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I was wondering, were any of the parents who are on this list <br/>\n&gt; unschooled as children??  I myself am from the *old school* of PS.  I <br/>\n&gt; was just curious about kids who  have been unschooled and then went on <br/>\n&gt; to college or whatever afterward.  I&#39;m only hearing about present day <br/>\n&gt; kids being unschooled and parent&#39;s recent dscision to do it.  Is there <br/>\n&gt; any *graduates* of unschooling with success stories to tell??

I don&#39;t get much out of programming <br/>\nthat is supposedly for adults, but seems increasingly luring to younger and <br/>\nyounger audiences. I despise and will not permit in my home:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jerry Springer and other garbage talk shows<br/>\n-Professional Wrestling<br/>\n-most soap operas<br/>\n-the Clairol Herbal Essence commercials and similar commercials irritate me <br/>\nalso, so I avoid channels/airtimes that they constanly air on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to have the TV on a lot for background noise, not as a choice, just a <br/>\nmindless habit. That hardly occurs anymore, especially now that we are <br/>\nunschooling. I prefer that if my daughter wants to watch something, she come <br/>\nand ask me, not just sit and surf. Mostly she enjoys the Game Show Channel, <br/>\nchannels like History, Discovery, Food TV, PBS, etc. I am easily annoyed by <br/>\nthe Cartoon Network and most Nickelodean programming, but I still allow her <br/>\nto watch it occasionally. We keep the computer and televisions in family <br/>\nrooms only. I don&#39;t believe in TVs and VCRs in childrens&#39; rooms, or <br/>\nunsupervised internet access. I have a TV in my bedroom, and would leave it <br/>\non all night like a night light for years (my husband&#39;s preference more than <br/>\nmine), but in the past few months of not bothering to find the remote <br/>\ncontrol, I have enjoyed not using the TV much at all anymore. I find I have <br/>\nmore time to read, get projects done, and my time doesn&#39;t evaporate as <br/>\nquickly as it used to. My quality of life has improved, and I assume it has <br/>\nfor my kids as well.

THere is no requirement of thinking for a child <br/>\nwhen they watch hours of TV.  I don&#39;t care how *Good* the programs <br/>\nare.  Children develop mentally by THINKING, using their imagination, <br/>\ncreativity!!!!!!!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the child sit in front of the TV hours on end???  And I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nthey are watching *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time.  Children <br/>\nlearn from TV good and bad.  Are these parents who allow unlimited TV <br/>\nbeing selective about what they watch?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37072,"nextTopicId":37122}}
