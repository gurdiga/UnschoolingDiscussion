The main reason for this is a three year old who has many severe and some fatal food allergies, while the rest of us can eat most anything.  I cannot let him help himself.  In fact we have very strict rules about him not being allowed even to help himself at a buffet or when someone offers him something, even a friend or another parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTime and again I have had to intersect a handoff of a dangerous substance before he ate any and explain to the horrified and apologetic friend that this is something he cannot eat.  When one does not have allergies, you do not think about food in the same way, read every label ad naseum, and take such precautions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe sometimes &quot;steals&quot; food from his younger brother and runs off to try to scarf it down, or does similar things with food found where it was left out and forgotten (like a candy for instance.)  We have had more than one allergy reaction from this kind of thing, because as a toddler he wants autonomy and control of his life and sometimes tries to take control of his diet to that end.  The problem of course is he does not know, nor does he remember, which things he can and cannot eat and which items have allergens in them or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI MUST supervise his diet or risk losing him every day.  For example, he knows he can eat cake, but only cake that I make with no dairy and eggs in it.  So Cake as a whole is off limits.  He always has to ask before he takes anything from anyone but us, and he always has to ask before getting anything for himself.  His allergies are too numerous and too complicated for him to decipher at this age.  I wish I could give him more freedom in the area of diet, but I can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html\">http://www.idahopagan.com/mail.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"susan","from":"susan &lt;fxfireob@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DSHP2X508AbKLbu7rp-EA4yJ7kITMxY8o0QEWoE2aaqkzXhcUTGq0inkkoep6vhj-swlFQpqkTrv9UN44RFTE-s","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling and Relaxed Meals/Eating","postDate":"954280282","msgId":7406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4RTEyOTJELkFDMzIwREFCQGZsYXNoLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWJmOTkyMiRmMmE4MGE2MCRhNTdlMzdkMkBsaWJieWdpcmw+"},"prevInTopic":7400,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":7405,"nextInTime":7407,"topicId":7395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, i ve  recently heard, somewhere, talk about eating a balanced diet and they were saying it is better to balance your diet over a week or a month instead of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1513310373\">hi,<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;ve  recently heard, somewhere, talk about eating a balanced diet and they<br/>\nwere saying it is better to balance your diet over a week or a month instead<br/>\nof a day or a meal.  meaning one day you can eat one sort of  food, on another<br/>\nday eat a different type just balance your diet that way instead of having a<br/>\nlittle of each different type of food in each meal.  i thought it was an<br/>\ninteresting idea.   i find my son kind of eats this way one day he&#39;ll eat lots<br/>\nof fruit another yogurt etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx<br/>\n&#39;unity through diversity&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nlibbygirl wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My comments were certainly not intended as a suggestion for everyone to<br/>\n&gt; follow but rather to demonstrate how I had to change my<br/>\n&gt; previously-unquestioned belief about the &quot;necessity&quot; for 3 meals a day!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Brooke<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7402,"nextTopicId":7404}}
