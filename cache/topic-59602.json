Fundamentalist parenting is scary. Deciding you believe in one <br/>\nmethodology <br/>\nor book, and only following that, from what I see, spells disaster. <br/>\nIt&#39;s ok not <br/>\nto follow the book, in fact, it&#39;s a good idea not to follow the book <br/>\nall the <br/>\ntime, or you would be crazy. I doubt Sear&#39;s, Waldorf, or any of them <br/>\ncan <br/>\nactually totally practice what they preach, and my friends who only <br/>\nfollow one <br/>\ndogma or another have problems with their kids just like everyone <br/>\nelse. <br/>\n2. Home Schooled Children and Parents are Horrible People who have NO <br/>\nregard <br/>\nfor anyone but themselves. <br/>\nHow could I make such a sweeping statement? <br/>\nWhen I opened Urban Monster, I made a pact to be a community <br/>\nresource, open to <br/>\nall, and make my space available to ANYONE who needed it for relevant <br/>\npurpose, <br/>\netc... Now, this remains true to all, but the NY Home Schooling <br/>\nAssociation and <br/>\ntheir kind or whatever they are called. I offered up my space for <br/>\na &quot;invitation <br/>\nonly&quot; story telling event private to the NY Home Schooling <br/>\nAssociation. They <br/>\ncame in droves, destroyed my place, yelled at me, destroyed <br/>\nmerchandise, the <br/>\nparents were even worse behaved than the little heathens they called <br/>\ntheir <br/>\nspawn. <br/>\nThere were other things I had committed to, but of course, after the <br/>\nstory <br/>\ntelling nightmare, how could we go on. Various members would call me <br/>\nasking me <br/>\nall sorts of questions about my space, have I tested for lead? what <br/>\nis my <br/>\ninsurance policy? poking around my basement and storeroom. No one was <br/>\nthe <br/>\nleader of this group? The leader of the group claimed she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nresponsible <br/>\nfor these subcommittees driving me bonkers on my phone, in meetings <br/>\nin my space. <br/>\nI get A LOT of kids in here. No group of children are worse behaved <br/>\nthan home <br/>\nschooled heathens, who grab things, stick them in their mouths, seven <br/>\nyear olds <br/>\njumping in my strollers, knocking things over and leaving them there. <br/>\nWhen I <br/>\nask the parents, &quot;could you ask your child to pick that up?&quot; they <br/>\nactually throw <br/>\nme shade as though I&#39;m ruining little baby&#39;s personality. Heck, the <br/>\nlittle nut <br/>\nis ruining my place, and it&#39;s pretty hard to trash my place, really. <br/>\nThe parents are even worse. Snobby politically correct wind bags, <br/>\nwhom none <br/>\nseem to have real jobs that I can see. <br/>\nThey are politically correct righteous wannabe anarchists who don&#39;t <br/>\ncare about <br/>\nanyone but themselves. Heck, I&#39;m a non-conformist F$%&*CK BUSH kind <br/>\nof gal, <br/>\nbut I would never leave my child without discipline or an <br/>\nunderstanding of what <br/>\nit means to behave in a group. <br/>\nTrust me this is not an option you want to jump head first into, just <br/>\ncause the <br/>\nbook is cool. <br/>\nI can spot a home school group from a mile a way. That is about the <br/>\nonly <br/>\nterrorist disaster I see using my duct tape for. Yikes. <br/>\nPhshew. <br/>\nxoxo, <br/>\nElissa Jane <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mom@...\">mom@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUrban Monster   <br/>\n396 Atlantic Avenue                    <br/>\nBrooklyn, NY 11217    <br/>\n718-855-6400<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a BUSINESS owner making this sweeping statement!!
