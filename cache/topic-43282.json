I don&#39;t think what is shown on <br/>\ncable is porn, some do. I do think that there are some specific shows on <br/>\nchannels like HBO, Cinemax, and Showtime that are what could be described as <br/>\n*soft* porn. But I don&#39;t think those are any worse than what you could <br/>\npossibly see in a movie. It&#39;s just that is all you see in these shows. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think Playboy is porn, but I do think there are magazines out there <br/>\nthat are porn. I think it is natural for a 12 to whatever age teen boy to be <br/>\ninterested, or curious and want to see what all the hoopla is about. And I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see anything nasty or wrong with that. I also think the same goes for <br/>\ngirls. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with a young boy having a Cosmo, or a <br/>\nPlayboy or whatever in his bedroom or bathroom. I know when I was a teen, <br/>\n(there aren&#39;t that many magazines out for girls) I read harlequin romances <br/>\nand the best parts were the pages I dogeared. &lt;g&gt; I also found a copy of <br/>\nPlaygirl once and WOW! That was fun for me! &lt;bg&gt; (I think I still might have <br/>\nthat stashed away in one of my boxes saved from highschool.) Is there <br/>\nanything wrong with it? IMO, no. Did my folks monitor it? They probably <br/>\nthought they did, but they must not have been too vigilant. Did I hide it? <br/>\nYes, because I instinctively knew that my parents would have thought it was <br/>\nwrong. Do I have a good healthy sexual relationship with my husband, are my <br/>\nmorals in the right place? Yes, and yes. Did my romance novels, trashy sex <br/>\nfilled books, and my one copy of Playgirl ruin me? Nope! Is Sandra&#39;s son <br/>\ngoing to be ruined by some Anime that has nudity or his Cosmo stashed in his <br/>\nbathroom? No. He is developing a good ideal of what a healthy sexual <br/>\nrelationship is from his parents.  A little cartoon girl with her naked, <br/>\nexaggerated breasts exposed (Japanese Anime doesn&#39;t show the pubic region as <br/>\na cultural thing, and even if it did, I still don&#39;t thing it would be wrong. <br/>\nAnd Darin just informed me that there are different levels of Anime called <br/>\nHentai and Magna.) and a half naked waif in Cosmo isn&#39;t going to damage him <br/>\nor another kid. Unless that is, if someone shames him and holds his small <br/>\ninterest up as example of something nasty and bad. So if your 12 yo son is <br/>\nwatching Bedtime Stories on Cinemax Late Night I wouldn&#39;t throw a hissey. And <br/>\nif he rents a graphic Anime I wouldn&#39;t worry. It isn&#39;t going to make him some <br/>\nsexual deviant. Anymore than a girl reading a romance novel, with heaving <br/>\nbreasts and thrusting members swelling against the center of her womanhood, <br/>\nis going to destroy her. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Porn and communication","postDate":"1031585048","msgId":43429,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5QTIzNTU4LkNDRTMlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5QTIyMUJBLkNDQzAlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":43418,"nextInTopic":43467,"prevInTime":43428,"nextInTime":43430,"topicId":43282,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The word &quot;monitor&quot; is most often used<br/>\nin the current culture to imply constantly watching. That&#39;s what a heart<br/>\nmonitor does.

Porn is being used and interpretted in a variety of ways and it&#39;s not<br/>\nreally clear that the answerers are using a different definition of porn<br/>\nfrom the original questioner.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo *me* porn means the type of movies not shown on regular expanded cable<br/>\n(cable with regular movie channels like HBO and Cinemax.) Porn to me is<br/>\nstuff you need to go to the backroom of a video rental store for. (I did a<br/>\ncheck of the 2AM-3AM movies for tonight. Mostly R (though some below, none<br/>\nabove). Mostly for violence. The only two movies that seem to be about sex<br/>\nare:<br/>\n<br/>\nL.A. Johns (Not rated) (HBO2) - The affairs of a top-dollar call girl<br/>\n(Brittney Powell), whose diverse clients include a CEO who likes to be<br/>\ndominated and a divorcé who&#39;s out to reform her. Madam Jack: Deborah Harry.<br/>\nJosh: John Terry. David: Thomas Calabro. Roger: Doug Davidson. Joyce Chopra<br/>\ndirected.<br/>\n<br/>\nCupid (R) (TMC) - Incestuous siblings solve their romantic troubles with<br/>\nmurder. Zach Galligan, Ashley Laurence, Mary Crosby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that&#39;s typical, that would be the level of &quot;porn&quot; that a 12 yo<br/>\ncould stumble over or choose to watch. *If* the family has cable. And *if*<br/>\nthe family subscribes to movie channels.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it would make the discussion clearer if those with questions were more<br/>\nclear about the type of content -- maybe specific movies -- that they would<br/>\nbe concerned about a 12 yo stumbling over. The term porn is just too vague.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also not clear why the 12 yo is watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked what to do about a one time traumatizing incident. I *think*<br/>\nin that question is the suggestion that it&#39;s possible that seeing one image<br/>\ncould scar a child for life. So perhaps that&#39;s why the answers -- that the<br/>\nrelationship is such that the kids will bring anything that troubles them to<br/>\nthe parents -- aren&#39;t seeming satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another question seems to be about them watching &quot;porn&quot; and the<br/>\nquestions aren&#39;t all using &quot;watching&quot; to mean the same thing. Some are<br/>\nrefering to seeing a movie that is troubling. Some are saying that it&#39;s<br/>\nnatural for (some) kids to want to see it so they&#39;ll watch it eagerly. And<br/>\nin that eagerness they will build up some unhealthy ideas about<br/>\nrelationships. Some are saying that porn is addictive or compelling so kids<br/>\nwill be compelled to watch it even though they don&#39;t feel totally<br/>\ncomfortable doing so and they&#39;ll get sucked into that dark alley. Some are<br/>\nsaying that porn is so compelling that the images of men degrading women<br/>\nwill override the loving relationship images that have been modeled for 12<br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why the 12 yos are watching needs cleared up before the discussion will<br/>\nyield any satisfying answers for the questioners.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You haven&#39;t asked ONE question to clarify<br/>\n&gt; &#39;where I am coming from&#39;.  You assume you just &#39;know&#39;, and you<br/>\n&gt; &#39;projected&#39; all kinds of assumptions and beliefs onto me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The words we use don&#39;t carry what *we* mean into someone&#39;s head. The words<br/>\nattempt to *recreate* what we mean in someone&#39;s head. And if the words we&#39;ve<br/>\nused mean something different to the person we&#39;re talking to, that person<br/>\nwill respond as though we&#39;ve asked a totally different question than what we<br/>\nthink we asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, not just here but in general, that it isn&#39;t the responsibility of<br/>\nthe answerer to figure out what we mean. It&#39;s *nice* if someone takes extra<br/>\ntime to help us ask what we&#39;re trying to ask. And the reason it&#39;s nice<br/>\nrather than expected is because whenever we ask a question we are imposing<br/>\non someone&#39;s time.

We owe it to ourselves -- because<br/>\npresumably we want the answer! -- and we owe it to those trying to help to<br/>\nbe as clear as possible so we don&#39;t waste their time. Sometimes that means<br/>\nworking extra hard at figuring out what their answers mean and why they are<br/>\nanswering the way they are.

My dh doesn&#39;t, <br/>\nbut he knows I wouldn&#39;t freak out if he did want it so he has no reason to <br/>\nhide it from me.<br/>\nI have told him point blank that I thought it was pretty weird that he never <br/>\nbought girly magazines or wanted to watch an erotic movie with me...he just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  And he knows that if he did want to I am not a person he would have <br/>\nto hide it from....hence my trust that he isn&#39;t trying to hide anything.<br/>\nSame with my son. He knows that I have sex books in the house. He knows I <br/>\nhave a Kama Sutra game in my closet, he asked what it was about and I told <br/>\nhim.<br/>\nSure he&#39;s pretty interested in human bodies and doesn&#39;t want to advertise <br/>\nthat interest. But anything violent or too intimate bothers him. And if it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t, he&#39;d be watching it.<br/>\nYou are assuming a lot of rotten things about children, which really shows me <br/>\nyour lack of trust in their sensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND the fact that my tv gets NO porn....whether you understand all the cable <br/>\npackages in the U.S. or not, I don&#39;t get porn, anytime, anywhere. <br/>\nAnd it wouldn&#39;t matter if I did.<br/>\nLet&#39;s say worst case scenario...he watches some. He&#39;s fascinated and is very <br/>\ncurious.<br/>\nYou know what? Yes, he&#39;d talk to me about it. Because I wouldn&#39;t freak out, I <br/>\nwould ask him what he thought. I would explain that it is not a realistic <br/>\nversion of sex in an intimate relationship and I would show him some sex <br/>\nbooks and talk to him.<br/>\nI&#39;m a safe haven. Not his enemy.<br/>\nYou are assuming children can have no power over persuasive ads or tv <br/>\nmanipulations, but adults can?<br/>\nI have more faith in my childs sense, wit and ability to know himself and <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43235,"nextTopicId":43579}}
