It wasn&#39;t unschool-style at all.  I planned <br/>\neverything, although I picked things I knew they would like.  I had 8 <br/>\ngirls.  2 of them were a big problem.  They stole, destroyed other <br/>\npeople&#39;s projects, and made things generally difficult.  They are a <br/>\nbig part of the reason why I quit.  The other reason was all the <br/>\nrules and paperwork anytime we wanted to go aywhere. Also just that I <br/>\nfelt I wasn&#39;t giving my boys as much time as I was giving my <br/>\ndaughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took a year off, then got together with a friend and had a troop <br/>\nwith just three girls--her two and my one.  It worked out nice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, I decided to go with a regular troop again.  I called a <br/>\nfew girls from our old troop and was going to open the troop up to 15 <br/>\ngirls at the sign ups our council was having.  Then they started <br/>\ngiving me trouble.  They started telling me that my  friend&#39;s <br/>\ndaughter (who plays with my daughter all the time) couldn&#39;t be in the <br/>\ntroop.  My friend&#39;s daughter is 7, and the guidelines for being in a <br/>\ntroop are at least age 8 or grades 3,4,5, and 6.  I signed her up as <br/>\na fourth grader and they wouldn&#39;t let me do it.  They said they were <br/>\nconcerned that the material is too much for a 7 year old.  I said <br/>\nthat her mom wasn&#39;t concerned, would be present at all meetings, and <br/>\nthat the mom&#39;s decision should be enough.  They kept insisting that a <br/>\n7 year old is a 2nd grader and that&#39;s all there is to it.  Then they <br/>\nsaid I couldn&#39;t have the meetings in my house.  I said forget it, I&#39;m <br/>\ndone with the girl scout organization!  So now we have a &quot;girls&#39; <br/>\nclub&quot; in our house.  It is totally unschooled style.  The girls pick <br/>\nall of the activities. I told them that I would do everything in my <br/>\npower to help them do the activities that they want to do.  We will <br/>\nalso have some fundraisers to help with the costs of activities. <br/>\nHowever, I had the luxury of choosing who I invite and have no <br/>\nproblems with any of the girls in the group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did find some places on the web with badges in stock and was either <br/>\ngoing to buy sashes for them or sew them. (www.joycrest.com is the <br/>\nbest badge place I found).  But they said they would rather make <br/>\nscrapbooks up of their activities instead of buying badges, so I&#39;ll <br/>\njust bring the digital camera along to our activities.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI checked with my insurance agent and he said that my home liability <br/>\ninsurance is enough to cover this type of thing.  I also had the <br/>\nparents sign liability waivers and forms giving me permission to take <br/>\nthem to the emergency room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI threw that out because it is one option you might want to <br/>\nconsider.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you keep the existing troop going, then maybe you might want to <br/>\nconsider choosing activities and meeting places where they can run <br/>\nwild.  Maybe they need to &quot;deschool&quot; from the idea that when they&#39;re <br/>\nin charge they run wild.  Maybe meet at playgrounds for awhile.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if you live in an area where there are a lot of <br/>\nplaygrounds that you could drive to in a reasonable amount of time, <br/>\nbut if you do, maybe you could have meetings at 4 different <br/>\nplaygrounds and then vote on which was your troop&#39;s favorite <br/>\nplayground.  Then maybe you could do something extra special for your <br/>\nfavorite playground as a troop.  Maybe volunteer to paint a bench, or <br/>\nclean up all the litter, or plant flowers or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they spend so much time cooped up in school that they NEED to <br/>\nrun.  Maybe take them to Mcdonalds and let them loose in the play <br/>\narea for a meeting.  Or find a big field and bring some equipment <br/>\n(frisbees, balls, badminton rackets) but no rules.  Just let them <br/>\nrun.  Maybe they could even handle a scavenger hunt, where they <br/>\ndivide into two groups, or draw names and go with a partner, and look <br/>\nfor a list of things you give them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is the hobby badge.  In my brownie troop, I had a night <br/>\nwhere everyone got a table to set up their special hobbies.  Someone <br/>\nbrought a coin collection, someone brought a beanie baby collection, <br/>\nsomeone brought her drawings, etc.  They each got time to tell <br/>\neveryone about their special hobby.  Since they love to talk about <br/>\ntheir interests, they took a lot of time setting up their tables with <br/>\ntheir collections.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also did secret pals (which is for one of the badges).  At the <br/>\nbeginning of the year, everyone drew names but didn&#39;t tell whose name <br/>\nthey drew.  Throughout the year, they did something special for their <br/>\nsecret pal--a little gift on their birthday or Christmas, little <br/>\nnotes or cards, etc.  At the end of the year, everyone guessed who <br/>\nhad been giving them treats all year and gave their secret pal a <br/>\nthank you present.  (We had a $5 limit).  That gives the girls a <br/>\nchance to focus on someone who they might not normally focus on--<br/>\npaying attention to when their birthday is, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a leader who handed her brownies a badge book and had them <br/>\neach pick a badge.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;do whatever you want at the meetings&quot; <br/>\nbut &quot;choose whatever badge you want to do at the meetings&quot;.  That&#39;s <br/>\nnot a totally unschooling approach though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea is that as soon as they earn their first badge, give <br/>\nthem their badge right away instead of waiting until the end of the <br/>\nyear.  Kids that age sometimes don&#39;t really know what a badge is or <br/>\nhow cool it is to have one for the sash until they get their first <br/>\none.  Then they want more.  But I wouldn&#39;t use the badges as <br/>\nmanipulation like schools use grades.  Maybe they don&#39;t care about <br/>\nbadges.  That&#39;s cool too. Maybe they just want to have fun doing <br/>\nstuff like run and play and make up their own games with their own <br/>\nrules like they don&#39;t get to do all day in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Lisa M.

She did 6 months<br/>\nof (as we call it) Dysfunctional Brownies, and she loved the concept but<br/>\nwas really frustrated by the chaos and arguing (kids and adults). The<br/>\ntroop she&#39;s in now has 9 or 10 girls, and the rest have been together for<br/>\nthree years. The leader started unschooling a couple years ago, and her<br/>\ndaughter is Rain&#39;s best friend (and her other daughter is the co-leader).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been an interesting ride. The girls are all really, really different<br/>\nfrom each other - some are in the Britney Spears and &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so fat!&quot;<br/>\nmode already, some live in really dysfunctional families. Two are from<br/>\nanother culture and try very hard to be quiet and respectful, and are<br/>\noften aghast at the noise and activity level of the other girls. From<br/>\nwhat I hear, the first year or so was rough, but they have really banded<br/>\ntogether and become a group, and they&#39;ve welcomed Rain as part of the<br/>\ngroup. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will probably take time for the girls, especially the new<br/>\ngirls, to gel as a group. I don&#39;t think rigid rules will help with this<br/>\nin the long run, although they seem to help in the short run. As I<br/>\nunderstand it, girl scouts are supposed to be about the girls being<br/>\ndecision-makers, and maybe you could point that out to the co-leader. I<br/>\nwould also try to plan really active meetings - since most of the kids<br/>\nhave been in school all day, I imagine they really need to let loose.<br/>\nMaybe you could have a clean up the playground day, or a scavenger hunt,<br/>\nor try some sports - just tire &#39;em out, but also focus on activities that<br/>\nbuild a sense of community. It seems that the more they&#39;re interested in<br/>\nthe activities and feel ownership, the easier it will be to get them<br/>\nfocused. Also, if they have a goal to work towards - Rain&#39;s brownie troop<br/>\nwent horseback riding - that might help them focus more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actally think going over (or creating) a list of rules or guidelines<br/>\nwould be helpful, especially with input from the girls. You could start<br/>\nwith the girl scout law and promise, I think they talk about stuff like<br/>\nthat... but it probably would help everyone feel safer to at least know<br/>\nwhat the expectations are. Rules like &quot;Be quiet when the leader is<br/>\ntalking&quot;  seems rigid and not so community-building, but since there is<br/>\nsomething in the girl scout stuff about being a sister to other girl<br/>\nscouts, something like &quot;treat troop members and leaders with<br/>\nconsideration&quot; might work better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t think things will change overnight, and there may always be a<br/>\nfair amount of noise and chaos. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t lead a troop,<br/>\nbecause I have a pretty low tolerance for that. Rain&#39;s leaders, however,<br/>\nare much better at going with the flow, and they can see when things are<br/>\njust loud and active, and when they&#39;re out of control. There are a fair<br/>\nnumbr of arguments, too, and there are girls that stick together and one<br/>\ngirl who apparently annoys just about everyone - but she&#39;s still<br/>\nincluded.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100122184,"authorName":"Lisa M.
