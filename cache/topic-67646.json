This is an aggressive especially when cornered spider<br/>\n(compared to the redback) that gets pretty large and black. It is kind<br/>\nof a spiky looking spider - not like the slithering string legs of the<br/>\nhuntsman. It makes a funnel shaped web in cracks in rocky areas - or now<br/>\ncracks in cement areas - under steps, in brickwork, the footings of<br/>\nhouses etc. This is a spider that loves the urban environment. What did<br/>\nI learn growing up in Sydney? Don&#39;t go barefoot outside in the concrete<br/>\nbackyards of out terraced houses. It rears up on its back legs in order<br/>\nto deliver a bite with force, and can go through socks or thin leather.<br/>\n(Stories of it biting through gumboots are urban myths - I think) There<br/>\nis an anti-venom now, but needs to be delivered speedily. Funnelwebs, I<br/>\nguess a related species, are also found in the temperate coastal rural<br/>\nareas, and build webs in holes in the ground. My mother&#39;s friend who had<br/>\na place at Lake Conjola on the south coast of NSW, used to protect his<br/>\ndogs by pouring kerosene into the little web holes and igniting it to<br/>\nkill the spiders in the back yard.
