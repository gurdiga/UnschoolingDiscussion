I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>\nrespect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets upset<br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t always<br/>\nobey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>\ndisrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we have a<br/>\ngreat amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>\nmyself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank you<br/>\nfor your help in advance. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24106,"nextTopicId":24098}}
