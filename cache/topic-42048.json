I believe that most anger comes from lack <br/>\nof acceptance, lack of compassion and fear.  Anger is not a race <br/>\nthing, it&#39;s always been with all of us.  I believe it&#39;s part of our <br/>\nlives because we don&#39;t do what is natural, we&#39;re constantly trying to <br/>\nchange others, change ourselves and fit in.  Improving ourselves <br/>\nwould be the better goal to me.  Unschooling is one of my ways of <br/>\nimproving my son&#39;s life, my husband&#39;s and my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think history cannot be ignored, it shouldn&#39;t be worshipped <br/>\nbut it should be respected.  (And the following has nothing to do <br/>\nwith race, Africans and Europeans both played a hand in the slave <br/>\ntrade.)  The people who settled the Americas originally using <br/>\ngenocide, slavery and violence started a ball in motion that is still <br/>\nrolling today.  Sadly the sins (self-inflicted nonsense) of the <br/>\nfather are visited on the son.  Our foundation is not one of love but <br/>\nof rape, violence and forced assimilation.  Why do we expect that not <br/>\nto be carried down through the generations?  That does not excuse <br/>\ndestructive behavior but it can explain it.  People don&#39;t spring <br/>\nforth fully formed from the ground, they are born to people who have  <br/>\ntaught them, at times brainwashed and influenced them to hate the <br/>\nsame things they hate and to love the things they love.  It takes <br/>\ntime for hateful teaching to be diluted.  It&#39;s not just going to <br/>\ndisappear in 10 generations or even 20 and mostly likely not 30.  <br/>\nWhether we acknowledge <br/>\nit consciously or not there is a script running in our heads most of <br/>\nthe day.  It&#39;s our parents voice, our teachers voices, our preacher, <br/>\nour oppressor, etc.  Destructively angry people haven&#39;t heard many <br/>\ncompassionate voices.  I don&#39;t believe they can hear them most of the <br/>\ntime because they are so infrequent in their world.  Criticizing them <br/>\nonly adds fuel to the fire.  That&#39;s why I take issue with Stanley <br/>\nCrouch, though I do agree with him on many things and don&#39;t consider <br/>\nhim an Uncle Tom.  However, I&#39;d be more impressed with him if he shut <br/>\nhis mouth and moved his ass.  He talks alot but offers no substantial <br/>\nsolutions.  He&#39;s also one of those people who tells people how they <br/>\nSHOULD be.  As long as he&#39;s telling people what to do to be <br/>\nacceptable he&#39;s a contributor to the problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think people can be forced to stop being destructive, but <br/>\nindividuals can avoid adding fuel to the fire.  Life is a journey <br/>\nthat needs to be played out, patiently.  I&#39;m an optimist who believes <br/>\nthe world is getting better.  But we have to allow the storm to play <br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo tie this into unschooling. I started out on the homeschooling <br/>\njourney with anger in my heart at the system, at my parents who <br/>\nbought into the system and at the world in general. I was tired of <br/>\nfeeling unhappy and tired of feeling I had to do things the way <br/>\neveryone told me I should, because those shoulds went against my <br/>\nnature.  I think I&#39;ve moved towards unschooling because I&#39;m not angry <br/>\nanymore,  I don&#39;t fear as much and  I&#39;ve accepted that it&#39;s ok to let <br/>\nnature take it&#39;s course, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to constantly fight my own nature, which is basically <br/>\ngood.  I can allow my son the room to be himself and to see himself <br/>\nas a good and worthy person, something missing on a wide scale in the <br/>\nblack community.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCherry in GA<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/26/02 9:44:36 AM, rsale515@c... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Do you want to talk about this? &#39;Cause I would love to.
