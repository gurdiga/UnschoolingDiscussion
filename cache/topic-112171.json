It was definitely related<br/>\nto things that are happening in our lives, but I came away with some<br/>\ninsights that I&#39;ve heard many times on this board about relating to<br/>\none another in the family within the unschooling philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the dream people were impressed with the potential of a great power<br/>\nwhich had been used individually but never collectively to the<br/>\nmagnitude they wanted to use it.  &lt;&lt;Skip to the part I remember<br/>\nvividly upon awakening... &gt;&gt;  There were holes in the earth.

Bottled up<br/>\n&quot;sticks&quot; led to these gigantic HUGE explosions.  I thought the dream<br/>\nblatantly spoke of anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up thinking a lot about that.  A long list of stuff: <br/>\n* Not allowing anger too important a space in our lives or giving it a<br/>\nlouder bang by bottling it up, but rather cooking on an &quot;open fire&quot; so<br/>\nto speak<br/>\n* Thinking, talking and acting on things that matter to us on a<br/>\npersonal not abstracted level; avoiding hypothetical issues (people in<br/>\nthe dream were actually cheerful about the potential for damage as<br/>\nthough it wouldn&#39;t effect them and the look on their faces was eerily<br/>\nfamiliar... I wondered why... the tendancy to abstract things/<br/>\ndistract ourselves removes us emotionally so that real present issues<br/>\ncan seem unrelated)<br/>\n* Talking and listening a bit at a time all along the way as we live<br/>\nour lives together; allowing &quot;steam&quot; to escape gradually from the<br/>\n&quot;kettle;&quot; sharing generally in a wider space rather than narrowing our<br/>\noutlets<br/>\n* Exercising reason while alone in our thoughts as well as in<br/>\nconversation together<br/>\n* Being friends with everyone&#39;s needs and emotions<br/>\n* NOT bottling up needs and  emotions or using them for power; but<br/>\nrather empowering ourselves and others simultaneously and sanely<br/>\n* Having a safe space for anger; not allowing it to overwhelm<br/>\nourselves and those around, or else everyone is traumatized<br/>\n* Stirring not from nervousness but enough to keep things from<br/>\nsticking onto the bottom and sides; not settling for sour burnt<br/>\ntastes; seeking out and stirring for happiness<br/>\n* Avoiding fancy alarms (labels for instance, or prejudgements, akin<br/>\nto entertaining hypotheticals); NOT abdicating our voices and minds to<br/>\nself-appointed experts; being aware ourselves of self and others;<br/>\nspeaking to the individual not statisticize ourselves and others; in<br/>\nother words, tending the &quot;kettle&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thought passed through my mind at some point that anger probably<br/>\nisn&#39;t even a primary emotion (not my idea but something I read.... I<br/>\nthink it was Marshall Rosenberg in NonViolent Communication).  Anger<br/>\nis probably fueled by other needs and emotions like love, fear,<br/>\nhunger, etc...  things that ARE primary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathe</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112137,"nextTopicId":112210}}
