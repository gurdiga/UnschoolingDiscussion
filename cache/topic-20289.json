Now my 5yo is using and understanding words like evolution and self-destruct.  I keep forgetting THEY HAVE A BRAIN.  All those years of science and Pokemon teaches the same thing to my 5yo.  I give up!  I like Pokemon now - just don&#39;t tell the guys.  Of, course, this group is the only place I can tell this as all the schoolies out there will either think I&#39;m whacked or why don&#39;t I do a 6month unit study on evolution.  Well, I can&#39;t very well do that now because the &quot;scientist&quot; have shed their white robes and just left to trek about the woods with their &quot;hunting&quot;<br/>\n dog and will most likely return with a variety of mud samples, bugs, lizards, and grand stories of their ventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice to be out of the cave.<br/>\n<br/>\nambersand</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20286,"nextTopicId":20291}}
