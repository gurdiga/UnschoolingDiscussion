She <br/>\nwasn&#39;t so bad when Percy was here, either, but now we get to see the real <br/>\nher, I think.  Except for one thing--she won&#39;t get along with other dogs when <br/>\nshe&#39;s on the leash!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in the country on 10 acres and there are lots and lots of dogs who <br/>\ncome around to visit her yard.  (I can hear all you city people clucking <br/>\nabout how she should be in a pen, but just hear me out! &lt;g&gt;)  There are 3 <br/>\ndogs who live across the field and they hang out with Ladybug and she&#39;s just <br/>\nfine around them outside.  But if I put her on a leash and let her sniff any <br/>\nanother dog, she gets to growling and nipping and won&#39;t let the other dog <br/>\nsniff her.  (She weighs only 12 pounds and stands about 10 inches at the <br/>\nshoulders, so she&#39;s almost always dwarfed by other dogs, so I understand <br/>\nfeeling intimidated.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what can I do to make her feel comfortable around other dogs while on the <br/>\nleash?  She&#39;s 4 now and it&#39;s time for her to know better.  Sometimes I pick <br/>\nher up and that makes her feel superior and stop growling...but the other dog <br/>\ncannot come near me, because, of course, she&#39;s trapped and protective and <br/>\ngoes nuts.  So, I usually pick her up and carry her away from the other dog, <br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t help her learn to accept them.  Short of obedience class, <br/>\nand I shudder to think about all those other dogs there, what to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51545,"nextTopicId":51623}}
