I guess I remind<br/>\nhim of gypsies with the lifestyle that our family has (unschooling and<br/>\neverything). Anyway, I told him that my grandparents were from Croatia. My<br/>\ngrandfather came over first and he kept sending my grandmother money. She<br/>\nand her friends went to get on the boat, but she didn&#39;t have all the funds<br/>\nshe needed. Her friends got on the Titanic, my grandfather sent more money<br/>\nand my grandmother took the sister ship of the Titanic which was the next<br/>\nship to come to america on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my piece of history,<br/>\nBarda<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;Shipping&quot; is  My  Business -<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got back home from my House Special at The General Mercantile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Merc makes coffee the slow way, using a 1950&#39;s<br/>\n                                                                 Italian<br/>\nLaPavoni Espresso Machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy House Special is alot like &quot;Shipping&quot; .
