I think trying to forgive keeps you trapped as that<br/>\nlittle child that has to somehow still believe that her parent loves her, in<br/>\nspite of the evidence to the contrary.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t feel like their little child.  I know my feelings were legitimate<br/>\nand valid.  My Dad loves me as best HE can -- my standard is just higher.<br/>\nMy Mom loves me, and has really come far in apologizing for her ways, tho<br/>\nshe&#39;s not entirely there yet.  Someday, she will be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ********<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I tried for years to truly forgive my Dad for the things he did to me. It<br/>\nnever really worked. I get along with him fine now and can enjoy his<br/>\ncompany. He has to treat me with respect now that I am an adult. The<br/>\nrelationship is different, he is still the same person, and he (as always)<br/>\nprofesses to love me.<br/>\n&gt; ********<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Forgiveness, to me, doesn&#39;t mean his actions were right, or that I<br/>\noverreacted.  It simply means I&#39;ve chosen not to be angry about them<br/>\nanymore; not to blame my Dad for my lot in life; not to brand him<br/>\nunacceptable (tho there are limits imposed by me to his relationships with<br/>\nmy children).  Forgiveness doesn&#39;t mean the offender is free to repeat his<br/>\nwrongs, only that the person wronged has let go of the anger and pain.  Of<br/>\ncourse, your interpretation may be different.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have negotiated a reasonably comfortable relationship with my Dad, and<br/>\nit was my choice to do that.  I would not have been able to do that had I<br/>\nnot forgiven him -- it&#39;s just how I&#39;m wired.  I&#39;ve learned a lot about my<br/>\nDad&#39;s childhood and early adulthood in the last 20 years.  I now understand<br/>\nhow he got so damaged. I felt I had to do that, because one of my sons is<br/>\nvery innately like the good parts of my Dad, and it scared me.  Sadly, their<br/>\nshared qualities weren&#39;t seen as such when Dad was a young boy.  Gary & I<br/>\njoke that Andy is my Dad with love and honesty.  I am determined to make<br/>\nAndy&#39;s life so much more than my Dad&#39;s is/was.  To do that, I needed to<br/>\nunderstand my Dad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Syl<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Y!
