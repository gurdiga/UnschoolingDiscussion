NOT. I swear sometimes I can see the brain cells floating off towards<br/>\n&gt;the set. (that was supposed to be a joke)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------<br/>\nMaybe the brain cells are floating off toward the set. If so, it&#39;s what she<br/>\nneeds right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices. If she has choices, she can pick and choose what is best for her.<br/>\nIf she really has the OPTIONS of watching television, reading or being read<br/>\nto, swimming or taking a walk, doing a craft or meeting a homeschooled<br/>\nfriend later, making a cake or building Legos, she&#39;ll make the RIGHT CHOICES<br/>\nfor her and for that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she has nothing on offer but TV, then that&#39;s what to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if she has only been watching TV 23 hours a day since February, my dear,<br/>\nyou haven&#39;t even really STARTED a TV Marathon yet! :) And, she can sense<br/>\nyour disapproval even if you don&#39;t voice it. Please, strive to truly accept<br/>\nher choices, not just clam up and bolt from the room. Anything less and<br/>\nyou&#39;re pushing her away.<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Every one I know is giving me a hard time about , Im not tough enough on her<br/>\n&gt;she has no structure.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to politely tell everyone else to hush up.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone else: WHAT?! She doesn&#39;t have a BEDTIME?!<br/>\nYou: Nope. How about this weather we&#39;re having?<br/>\nEveryone else: WHAT?! She watches 14 hours of TV before BREAKFAST?!<br/>\nYou: Yep. So you think the Yankees will go all the way this year?<br/>\nEveryone else: WHAT?! The BANK was your MAJOR LEARNING EXPERIENCE of the<br/>\nWEEK?!!!!!<br/>\nYou: Yep. Gosh, look at the time. Gotta go!<br/>\n<br/>\nEtc.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Im afraid that if I dont bring things up she will  miss it. Im afraid if I<br/>\n&gt;let my guard down and just live then she wont learn anything.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bold is mine. Fear is a terrible thing. I would definitely get your<br/>\ndaughter a subscription to TV Guide and Gameboy Digest and work on your<br/>\nfears. They will cripple you, and perhaps your daughter as well. You have<br/>\nsome homework to do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;It must work<br/>\n&gt;so many of you do it and your kids are learning. Some of them are<br/>\n&gt;overlearning or over achievers . I keeep waiting for that. It has not come<br/>\n&gt;yet.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>----------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does overlearning or overachieving look like? Doing math workbooks?<br/>\nBuilding a rocket? Reading War and Peace? Seriously, think about what you<br/>\nare &quot;waiting for&quot;. Name it. Write it down. Consider whether its importance<br/>\nis relevant to your daughter, or is it phantoms cast by relatives, or<br/>\nfriends with straight A students (poor things, I was one of them, they are<br/>\nin for a serious shock when thrust into real life), or your own schooled<br/>\nexperiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices. If your daughter has choices with what to do with her time, she<br/>\nwill choose the best and wisest course for HER. None of us know what that<br/>\ncourse is. She will know it when she sees it, so your job is to put<br/>\neverything you can think of in her line of sight, and then step aside.<br/>\nBasically, think of yourself as an 18th century intellectual and spiritual<br/>\nand nutritional valet.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21856,"nextTopicId":21859}}
