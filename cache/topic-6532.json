If you buy your groceries first thing in the morning, it<br/>\n&gt;will be easier to actually do the work. I can get the kids to help with the<br/>\n&gt;buying and cooking but I usually let them be the tasters, and they get<br/>\n&gt;something they want when shopping (is this bribery, or just good planning)<br/>\n&gt;They actually like trying to find what I want...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Buy in bulk (if you can). I never buy in less than 10 LB for meat. I bring<br/>\n&gt;it home and then cook it when I am putting the other stuff away. there are<br/>\n&gt;so many things that you can do with ground beef (precooked). But get<br/>\n&gt;creative. I know that it took me a lot of time to actually start cooking<br/>\n&gt;ahead.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Oh, and when it comes to cooking from scratch, buy things like egg noodles.<br/>\n&gt;What I originally did was fake recipes. (Look at the hamburger box, and try<br/>\n&gt;to make it without the nifty box) One of the faves in our home is ground<br/>\n&gt;hamburger with egg noodles in cream of mushroom soup. Seriously! Last night<br/>\n&gt;I changed to chicken and added French cut green beans to it, for the exotic<br/>\n&gt;look! LOL I used 2 full bags of noodles, 4 cans of mushroom soup, 2 cups of<br/>\n&gt;milk, and about 1 complete fryer chicken (deboned) I have enough now for 2<br/>\n&gt;more dinners out of that one pot!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It took me a while to actually get it together enough to cook enough for<br/>\n&gt;many dinners, but now I cannot cook normal if you paid me.
