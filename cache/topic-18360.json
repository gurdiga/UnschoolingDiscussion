Do they just say 3rd if they&#39;re 8, or do<br/>\n&gt;they start explaining about being homeschooled?<br/>\n&gt;Because usually people who ask that are just making<br/>\n&gt;small talk. Is it our responsibility to demystify<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling by telling everyone we meet we do it? Or<br/>\n&gt;is it ok to just say 3rd grade?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;**It all depends on the situation. If it&#39;s someone I know and we have time<br/>\n&gt;to talk (and they act like this isn&#39;t just standard kid questioning) then I<br/>\n&gt;explain unschooling. If it&#39;s just some person I&#39;ll probably never talk to<br/>\n&gt;again we give them their grade levels.
