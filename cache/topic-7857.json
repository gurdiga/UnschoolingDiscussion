The show will be *taped* Tuesday and, sorry, I forgot to ask when<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; will air (but I don&#39;t think it will be Tuesday).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The show is part of what they call &quot;Letters to Oprah.&quot;  In response to<br/>\n&gt; Dr.<br/>\n&gt; Botstein&#39;s appearance on the show they received a lot of letters about<br/>\n&gt; hsing, as well as recommendations to do a show on the topic from<br/>\n&gt; audience<br/>\n&gt; guests.  The producer kept talking about &quot;segments,&quot; so I&#39;m still not<br/>\n&gt; clear<br/>\n&gt; on whether or not the entire hour is hsing, or if part is hsing and<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; part about another topic of &quot;letters to Oprah.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The conflict about what kind of show it is, I think, comes from a lot of<br/>\n&gt; information flying through hsing grapevines.  It *appears* that they are<br/>\n&gt; asking everyone they contact for &quot;failure&quot; stories of some sort.  At the<br/>\n&gt; same time it was explained to me that they will probably go with one of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; sociologists or psychologists they&#39;ve already interviewed in an effort<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; appear &quot;neutral&quot; on the subject.  The sociologist/psychologist they have<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; mind would be one who has &quot;worked with homeschoolers&quot; and has &quot;no agenda<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; his/her own on the topic.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bottom line?  I don&#39;t think they have the slightest idea of what they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; doing - I don&#39;t think anyone at Oprah has read two lines of any hsing<br/>\n&gt; book<br/>\n&gt; - and I don&#39;t know why, if the sociologist/psychologist is the case,<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; are following through with 3 or more phone calls to people like me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps clear things up,<br/>\n&gt; Linda </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7856,"nextTopicId":7858}}
