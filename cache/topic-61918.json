Oh, and we colored in a <br/>\npaperdoll cut out like Joe from Blues Clues and used scissors and lots of <br/>\ntape to make a house for him.  (I got a pack of 40 paperdoll cut outs from an <br/>\narts supply catalogue and they come in a variety of skin tones.  We have an <br/>\nasian Joe right now.)
