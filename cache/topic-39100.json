(LONG)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;And another thing! Forcing a child into a group situation where he has to do what the group wants even if it goes against his better judgment, only serves to break a child down. It erodes their self confidence, it teaches them that they are not important.<br/>\n          Which is exactly what I saw in his class today.  He needs to learn to approach others less confrontationally, but I don&#39;t think this is the group he needs to learn it on.  I feel badly that things went this far before I found there was a problem, but all his other teachers said that things were fine when I asked.  They were always saying how well behaved he and  his sister were.  He needs to be pulled out of the class so he can feel good about the standards he has chosen to uphold, and once he is more at ease, we can work on how to help the others see his view point (and work on him understanding theirs!).  Or am I wrong?   Debi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
