(holy<br/>\n_moly_ how did she get so grown up so quick?!)     (&quot;Young Wizards&quot;<br/>\nForum - great series by Diane Duane, btw)  We have discussed the<br/>\nslight possibility of him not being who he says he is,  etc.  (well,<br/>\nI&#39;ve discussed, she just says &quot;I know, mom&quot; with a touch of<br/>\nexasperation :-) ) (he lives in Richmond, VA - we&#39;re middle coast NC)<br/>\nThey&#39;ve talked to each other on the phone a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years ago, when she started going online lots, I was very<br/>\napprehensive about her having her own email, using her own name,<br/>\nsaying where she lived, and giving out our phone number.  (I went to<br/>\ngoogle preferences and removed the reverse address look-up thing for<br/>\nour number, but you can still get it through some company that charges<br/>\n$15)   So that was a coule of years ago.  Since then I have relaxed<br/>\ntons in that regard. Thanks mostly to you guys and the reality of it<br/>\nbeing that there are so many people online _I_ would like to meet in<br/>\nperson and I know great relationships (friends or otherwise) start<br/>\nwith knowing someone online. It just makes so much sense to _talk_<br/>\nabout it - talk about the ins and outs, good and bad,  precautions,<br/>\netc...  Definitley _not_ create rules, or put up boundries (making<br/>\nthings more attractive...).  She&#39;s got her own email addresses, blog,<br/>\netc.   Apparently, (and unfortunately) though, I didn&#39;t talk enough<br/>\nabout relaxing my views on things and wasn&#39;t specific in regard to<br/>\nphone numbers. It seems she hid the fact that she gave him our number<br/>\n(or at least didn&#39;t tell me about it) - I got up in the middle of the<br/>\nnight (dog pestering to go out) and saw that she was talking to him on<br/>\nthe phone.  I&#39;m not sure why she did this, we don&#39;t &quot;punish&quot;,<br/>\nthreaten, even &#39;scold&#39;. But she did say she wasn&#39;t really hiding, but<br/>\nrather didn&#39;t want to wake us up (in a back room - I saw the light<br/>\nunder the door) and they both just happen to be awake at that time of<br/>\nday...   <br/>\n<br/>\nRachel has always kept things to herself.  Bugs the HECK out of me,<br/>\nbut I just need to see that&#39;s how she is.  Since she was 7, I&#39;d ask<br/>\n&quot;what&#39;s that book about&quot; she&#39;d say &quot;stuff&quot;,  &quot;like what?&quot;, &quot;a girl&quot;, <br/>\netc... &lt;sigh&gt;   Very hard for me. I am a talker.  Dh isn&#39;t though, <br/>\ngenetics?  lol  <br/>\n<br/>\nI reiterated the fact that I&#39;m here to *help her with what she wants<br/>\nto do*.  I am not an adversary. (not that she thinks that, but just to<br/>\nmake sure...) I was the one who mentioned if they wanted to meet in<br/>\nperson, we would figure a way.  Month goes by and she&#39;s taking me up<br/>\non it. :-) They&#39;d like to meet. I don&#39;t have any experience with this<br/>\nkind of thing.

Seems simple enough...  There are lots of<br/>\nhomeschool teens in the area, but nowhere for them to get together to<br/>\nhang out.  One woman tries to arrange a monthly activity, usually some<br/>\nsort of community service.  But no hanging out afterwards...   So I<br/>\nstarted a teen movie night.  So far it&#39;s worked great.
