When you are in love with them,  <br/>\nit&#39;s too easy to be self conscious, and the scene goes nowhere good.    When you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know them well, your creativity is sparked, and that&#39;s where that <br/>\nfantastic on-screen chemistry can come from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s quite a few examples of this, like Tom and Nicole in the Kubrick <br/>\nfilm, Ben and JLo in Gigi, both got bad reviews because of no on screen chemistry, <br/>\nreal life lovers.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you&#39;re a really good actor or actress, and you are in the moment, this <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t matter, but.....lol<br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71792,"nextTopicId":71693}}
