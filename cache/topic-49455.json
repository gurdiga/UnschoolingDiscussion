He often discusses something he <br/>\ncalls &quot;the religious imagination&quot;. What he is referring to is that each <br/>\nof us has a way in which we &quot;imagine God&quot;. I have always found his work <br/>\nfascinating. If you&#39;re interested, read &quot;The Catholic Imagination&quot;. The <br/>\npremise, if I recall correctly, is that Protestant Christians see God as <br/>\n&quot;elsewhere&quot; (in Heaven, not on earth) whereas Catholics see God as <br/>\npresent in the world. That this basic differene allows for totally <br/>\ndifferent understandings of Christianity and society.

That might clarify what specific beliefs<br/>\nwe are talking about. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Statement of Faith<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily Association for Instruction and Teaching at Home<br/>\n<br/>\n1. We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired <br/>\nWord of God, without error, the revelation of his will for the salvation of <br/>\nmen. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. We believe in one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and <br/>\neternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been <br/>\nconceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the <br/>\ncross, the sacrifice for our sins according to the scriptures. Further, He <br/>\narose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of <br/>\nthe Majesty on High, He is our Priest and Advocate. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord <br/>\nJesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing <br/>\nsinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living <br/>\nand sacrifice. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. We believe the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provide the <br/>\nonly ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only <br/>\nthose who receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus become <br/>\nchildren of God. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <br/>\nand that this &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; has a vital bearing on the personal life and <br/>\nservice of the believer. <br/>\n<br/>\n7. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to <br/>\neverlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord; of the unrepentant to judgment <br/>\nand everlasting conscious punishment.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49466,"nextTopicId":49530}}
