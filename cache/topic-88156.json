They looked at me funny when I told them I don&#39;t. I <br/>\ndecided to blow them off because I figure if I make a BIG DEAL and <br/>\nprovide them with something they will require it for everyone so <br/>\nwhat I did is provide them with my approval letter and that was it.  <br/>\nI figure it is none of their business (schools either) and I already <br/>\ndon&#39;t like that I have to report to the schools anyway. They never <br/>\nsaid a word and never mentioned a thing about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note I thought it was way to many hours for my son and I <br/>\nfelt bad for those poor little guys that had to go to school on top <br/>\nof it all. My son ended up deciding that it was not fun for him and <br/>\nquit. While he was on the team one of the woman coaches commented <br/>\nabout another child that he had problems because he was home <br/>\nschooled. She ended up getting to know my son because my husband <br/>\ncoached until the end (even after my son quit). She loved my son <br/>\nbecause he was thoughtful and very respectful as well as one of the <br/>\nmost polite kids on the team. I think his purpose there was not to <br/>\nplay football but possibly to teach her or show her another veiw of <br/>\na home schooled boy (unschooled). I would like to also add her kids <br/>\nwere horrible - sorry but it&#39;s true.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think the less we give these places the better. They did give <br/>\nme a stink @ first and said &quot;Oh we have to ask someone about that&quot; I <br/>\nignored them and said here this is what we have because he is so <br/>\nyoung I have assembled my very own cirriculum. Even if he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nyoung I would of siad the same thing !!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck !!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonya<br/>\nAttleboro Mass</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88125,"nextTopicId":88177}}
