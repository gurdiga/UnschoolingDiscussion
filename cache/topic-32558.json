He has been since he was a toddler.<br/>\nWhen we go to the library, he checks out the &quot;shooter&#39;s bible&quot;, basically a<br/>\ncatalog of all the different kinds of guns.  Rather than attempting to<br/>\ndissuade him, we have helped him learn how to follow his interests in a safe<br/>\nmanner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot about gun safety, he visited with a local gunsmith who talked<br/>\nwith him about how guns work and gun safety, he went to the local shooting<br/>\nrange and spent some time with an instructor, he is hoping to join the<br/>\nshooting sports 4-H club next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach has a BB gun with which he is very careful.  He only shoots at targets<br/>\nand only in a specified safe area out back.  We have rarely even had to<br/>\npoint out minor safety oversights to him and he has never pointed it at<br/>\nanyone or any living things.  But to see Zach with a toy gun is completely<br/>\ndifferent.  He is constantly &quot;shooting&quot; people, cars, animals, birds with<br/>\nhis toys.  Reason being that he is a normal 8yo and is very aware of the<br/>\ndifferences between reality and play.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32557,"nextTopicId":32561}}
