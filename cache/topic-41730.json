I didn&#39;t realize other states didn&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; truancy fines...How do they enforce compulsory education laws?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Homeschoolers have trouble with this all the time in PA.  Our messed <br/>\n&gt; up law says that if a school district feels satisfactory education <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t occurring, he should initiate a due process hearing. BUT!  No <br/>\n&gt; districts ever do.  That would cost them money.  So instead, they <br/>\n&gt; throw truancy fines.  And guess who gets to keep the money from <br/>\n&gt; truancy fines?  Yep, the district.  Isn&#39;t that sweet?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, for example, the law doesn&#39;t say that we need to show a copy of <br/>\n&gt; our highschool diploma in order to homeschool, but many homeschoolers <br/>\n&gt; attach it anyway.  (According to the law, we simply need to attest to <br/>\n&gt; having a highschool diploma in the affidavit).  So if a district <br/>\n&gt; wants to demand something--like a highschool diploma, or evidence of <br/>\n&gt; immunization, or even a daily teacher&#39;s plan book, they often charge <br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers with truancy.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If a homeschooler forgets to hand in an affidavit in PA, they get <br/>\n&gt; fined for every day their children are &quot;truant&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When my brother was a teenager my parents couldn&#39;t get him to go to <br/>\n&gt; school.  They allowed him to become an emancipated minor so that they <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to keep paying the fines. (They didn&#39;t understand or know <br/>\n&gt; much about homeschooling at the time).  I think it got to the point <br/>\n&gt; where the fines were 100 a day.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know a lady who felt convicted that she didn&#39;t want to answer to <br/>\n&gt; the state about her kids&#39; education and tried to <br/>\n&gt; homeschool &quot;underground&quot;.  (No affidavit filed, no portfolio turned <br/>\n&gt; in, no tests, no evaluations).  She got away with it for awhile and <br/>\n&gt; then got reported (You know, the usual, &quot;So and so&#39;s kids are never <br/>\n&gt; in school report).  They charged her with truancy and fined her.  She <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t pay the fines.  Her husband did some jail time over unpaid <br/>\n&gt; truancy fines.  Officials came for him and aimed a loaded shot gun at <br/>\n&gt; her and her children (over unpaid truancy fines).  She was in court <br/>\n&gt; for a long, long time and ended up losing anyway.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I copied the following from this website:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm\">http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ºIf a judge finds a child truant, what can the judge do to the <br/>\n&gt; parents and the child?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The judge can order a variety of penalties if the judge finds that <br/>\n&gt; the child is truant.

Or, the <br/>\n&gt; judge could require the parent to complete a &quot;parenting education <br/>\n&gt; program.&quot;  The judge can also decide that instead of, or in addition <br/>\n&gt; to, the fine or education program, the parent must perform community <br/>\n&gt; service in the school district where the child lives for up to six <br/>\n&gt; months.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the parent fails to comply with the court order, they can be <br/>\n&gt; sentenced to serve up to five (5) days in a county jail.

I didn&#39;t realize other states didn&#39;t have <br/>\ntruancy fines...How do they enforce compulsory education laws?  <br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers have trouble with this all the time in PA.  Our messed <br/>\nup law says that if a school district feels satisfactory education <br/>\nisn&#39;t occurring, he should initiate a due process hearing. BUT!  No <br/>\ndistricts ever do.  That would cost them money.  So instead, they <br/>\nthrow truancy fines.  And guess who gets to keep the money from <br/>\ntruancy fines?  Yep, the district.  Isn&#39;t that sweet?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example, the law doesn&#39;t say that we need to show a copy of <br/>\nour highschool diploma in order to homeschool, but many homeschoolers <br/>\nattach it anyway.  (According to the law, we simply need to attest to <br/>\nhaving a highschool diploma in the affidavit).  So if a district <br/>\nwants to demand something--like a highschool diploma, or evidence of <br/>\nimmunization, or even a daily teacher&#39;s plan book, they often charge <br/>\nhomeschoolers with truancy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a homeschooler forgets to hand in an affidavit in PA, they get <br/>\nfined for every day their children are &quot;truant&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my brother was a teenager my parents couldn&#39;t get him to go to <br/>\nschool.  They allowed him to become an emancipated minor so that they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to keep paying the fines. (They didn&#39;t understand or know <br/>\nmuch about homeschooling at the time).  I think it got to the point <br/>\nwhere the fines were 100 a day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lady who felt convicted that she didn&#39;t want to answer to <br/>\nthe state about her kids&#39; education and tried to <br/>\nhomeschool &quot;underground&quot;.  (No affidavit filed, no portfolio turned <br/>\nin, no tests, no evaluations).  She got away with it for awhile and <br/>\nthen got reported (You know, the usual, &quot;So and so&#39;s kids are never <br/>\nin school report).  They charged her with truancy and fined her.  She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t pay the fines.  Her husband did some jail time over unpaid <br/>\ntruancy fines.  Officials came for him and aimed a loaded shot gun at <br/>\nher and her children (over unpaid truancy fines).  She was in court <br/>\nfor a long, long time and ended up losing anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI copied the following from this website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm\">http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nºIf a judge finds a child truant, what can the judge do to the <br/>\nparents and the child?<br/>\n<br/>\n The judge can order a variety of penalties if the judge finds that <br/>\nthe child is truant.  The parent can be found guilty of a summary <br/>\noffense and fined up to $300 for each truancy violation.  Or, the <br/>\njudge could require the parent to complete a &quot;parenting education <br/>\nprogram.&quot;  The judge can also decide that instead of, or in addition <br/>\nto, the fine or education program, the parent must perform community <br/>\nservice in the school district where the child lives for up to six <br/>\nmonths.  <br/>\n<br/>\n If the parent fails to comply with the court order, they can be <br/>\nsentenced to serve up to five (5) days in a county jail.  However, if <br/>\nthe parents haven&#39;t paid the fine that the court has ordered, they <br/>\ncan only be sent to jail after a hearing is held to determine whether <br/>\nthey had the financial ability to pay the fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending upon the child&#39;s age, the judge can fine the child up to <br/>\n$300 for each truancy violation, if the parents can show they tried <br/>\nto try to get the child to go to school.  Or, the judge can assign <br/>\nthe child to an &quot;adjudication alternative program&quot; (such as an <br/>\neducation program or community service).<br/>\n<br/>\nA child who is found to be truant can also have his or her driver&#39;s <br/>\nlicense suspended for 90 days if it is the child&#39;s first truancy <br/>\nconviction.  The child&#39;s driver&#39;s license will be suspended for six <br/>\n(6) months for any additional truancy conviction.  If the child does <br/>\nnot have a driver&#39;s license, the chance to apply for one will be <br/>\nsuspended for 90 days for the first truancy offense, and six (6) <br/>\nmonths for additional offenses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/22/02 11:03:52 PM, sheran@p... writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; She has to go enough so that she doesn&#39;t start getting truancy <br/>\n&gt; fines.

To really break away from the school system.  <br/>\nI would not jump right back in without some long serious talks and <br/>\nlots of soul searching and brainstorming for other options.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4514776,"authorName":"megamom08","from":"&quot;megamom08&quot; &lt;megamom08@...&gt;","profile":"megamom08","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"SOS my daughter wants to try school again","postDate":"1030028200","msgId":41730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFrMnUzOCtjaWlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41734,"prevInTime":41729,"nextInTime":41731,"topicId":41730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HELP!

I think it is a foreshadowing of how I <br/>\nwill feel when any of my kids are ready to leave the nest. We began <br/>\nunschooling in february 2002, after many years of public school <br/>\ntroubles. We pulled her out, and began deschooling/unschooling. A lot <br/>\nof damage was repaired. I saw a spark and happiness that I had not <br/>\nseen since before preschool. I have seen a maturity in this 10yo that <br/>\nhas surprised me. To listen to her explain why she loves <br/>\nhomeschooling to grandparents and friends has been a great <br/>\naffirmation to this way of life. But now she wants to go back to <br/>\nschool. She insists I have &quot;trained&quot; her to stand up for herself, be <br/>\ndisciplined, do things right the first time, and she knows she can <br/>\nsucceed. I have never seen this maturity and confidence from her. <br/>\nWhat do I do? I worry that her kinesthetic on the move/ADD style of <br/>\nlearning will be snuffed out again. I do not endorse public school <br/>\nafter all i have learned through researching homeschooling. <br/>\nUltimately I have told her it is her decision. I don&#39;t want to stifle <br/>\nher courage and confidence to go back to a place that was such a <br/>\nrelief to get away from. I want her to spread her wings and fly when <br/>\nshe feels she is ready. I was hoping she would never want to back to <br/>\nschool. I thought she would at least wait until middle school or high <br/>\nschool before she started wondering what she is missing. I believe it <br/>\nis still unschooling if she goes to school by her choice. I am <br/>\nwondering if they can let her attend half days and still let me be <br/>\nresponsible for her education. I hesistate to call the school, i <br/>\ndon&#39;t think they have her best interests in mind. I need some serious <br/>\nadvice. I am in Ohio, if anyone can give specific advice. Ironically <br/>\nwe have a portfolio review scheduled for monday, and school started <br/>\nyesterday. Do i cancel the review and call the school?
