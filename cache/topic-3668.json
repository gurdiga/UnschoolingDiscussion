My<br/>\nson came along about 8 years later.  I had started as a computer sales<br/>\nperson for a Computerland store back in 1984, worked there 3 months and then<br/>\nthey went broke.  So, with my vast :-) amount of computer knowledge I<br/>\nstarted my own company.  At first I had offices and traveled all around the<br/>\ncountry.  It was okay for that time in my life.

I have been there<br/>\never since.  I have grown from being a computer salesman to a software<br/>\nengineer and that really helps.  I have also steadfastly remained free and<br/>\nindependent so I did not get sucked into a big company with all those sticky<br/>\nrules lie: You have to show up for work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an enormous financial and professional struggle for years (my wife is<br/>\na SAHM and does not bring in income).

He won&#39;t let me get one bc he thinks they look like the baby&#39;s going to fall out.  I&#39;ve never used one, but I do have a front carrier that criss-crosses in back and a backpack.  We use the carrier when we go places where we don&#39;t want to push around a stroller.  I like dad to carry her bc he&#39;s stronger and my back usually hurts after 5 min., but 9 times out of 10 mom ends up with her bc she is happier and more content with me.  Usually right after she&#39;s eaten and sleepy he can get away with it. <br/>\n    Does anyone else have that happen?  That the baby is not so content with dad?  With our first daughter, it upset him and he felt bad that she would cry when he held her.  Well, I should not say that.  He could hold her without her crying, but if she started crying, he couldn&#39;t soothe her.  But when he handed her to me, she would instantly stop crying.  Like I said it hurt his feelings, but now with this one, who does the same thing, it kind of makes him mad. He doesn&#39;t act on it and it&#39;s not really anger, he just really wishes that he could comfort his crying daughter also.  He understands but it still hurts. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Although,  now our first is such a daddy&#39;s girl, it&#39;s not even funny!!!  She loves mom, but when dad walks in the room her face lights up like a Christmas tree!  So, I guess I had my time and now it&#39;s his.  It eventually balances out, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Living for Him, <br/>\n    Faith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"faith buckley","from":"faith buckley &lt;faithb@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YXR0OP0uo0kvYd8p0iim9ixlRC1girOS56DoLMvyqm6PdGHUSQzPQPw3js2bOs3kBzI4Me1c1BrwDx3UqlSQ21-7h0D5tg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Slings and dads","postDate":"939489937","msgId":3668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDcuMzY2OC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3681,"prevInTime":3667,"nextInTime":3669,"topicId":3668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t have a sling, probably bc they make my husband nervous.
