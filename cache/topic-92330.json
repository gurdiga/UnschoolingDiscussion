Going ahead even though you feel fear?<br/>\n  As for your parents...how much have they read on education? On learning? on parenting? Who have they talked to? When my MIL brings up objections I just think about how long ago it was that I thought the same thing and what a huge amount of research has happened since then. Research my MIL has never done or bothered to do. You know more then your parents. Hold on to that little gem every time they open their mouths about unschooling. You&#39;re talking to people who are ignorant about what you want to do, remind yourself that YOU&#39;RE the informed one, they aren&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77662315,"authorName":"arcarpenter2003","from":"&quot;arcarpenter2003&quot; &lt;arcarpenter@...&gt;","profile":"arcarpenter2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: update: unschooling expo w/ parents","postDate":"1080706326","msgId":92334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM0ZGdlbSttYjE4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM0ZDZhNStmbWR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":92330,"nextInTopic":92339,"prevInTime":92333,"nextInTime":92335,"topicId":92330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
