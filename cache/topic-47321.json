We do have certain ways of<br/>\ndoing things based on reasons.  We work hard not to spill food and drink on<br/>\nthe carpet so most eating is done at the table.  We have lots of animals to<br/>\ncare for so most days we are up by 8:00 or so.  We love each other so most<br/>\nof the time we try to be nice, share, be respectful.  We have a large house,<br/>\nlots of animals, lots of kids so most days we pitch in to help pick up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key word above is &quot;most&quot;.  Nothing is written in stone, things are<br/>\nfluid....but what is not optional is being part of the family.  If there is<br/>\na problem lets talk it out, work it out, find a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are days when one of the kids or *I* even am grumpy and out of sorts.<br/>\nPerhaps Zach hit his sister or I snapped at somebody.  We talk about it,<br/>\ngive each other room, forgive and move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47295,"nextTopicId":47271}}
