To be fair, I&#39;m not a big TV watcher and I&#39;ve only <br/>\nwatched Dr Phil&#39;s show maybe twice, once when he did a show on <br/>\ncouples and had them attend a week-long thingy and this one on <br/>\nparenting.  He did ok with the couples.  He got them talking.  From <br/>\nwhat I saw of his show, he asks them the problem, then finds the <br/>\nperson who&#39;s to blame for the problem, then yells at them to either <br/>\nshape up or ship out.  But, that&#39;s adults who are choosing to work <br/>\ntogether to solve their problems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t have that choice.  They are stuck with the rules of the <br/>\nparents usually without discussion.  Dr Phil told one mother to take <br/>\n90% of all her daughter&#39;s toys away and let her know the other 10 <br/>\ncould also go if she didn&#39;t behave.  He told another mother to take <br/>\nthe TV away so her son would go out and play.  She had complained <br/>\nthat he watched 9 hours of TV a day.  He was about 4.  The yard was <br/>\nhuge, ugly, fenced-in, in the direct sun, patches of grass and lots <br/>\nof trucks.  There was no shade, no swings or slides, and no fun.  <br/>\nPlus, he didn&#39;t ask her if she offered to play with him.  Maybe she <br/>\njust opened the back door and said to go out to play.  Does the mom <br/>\nask the boy to help her bake?  We don&#39;t know because he didn&#39;t ask <br/>\nher.  Dr Phil just told her to take away the TV and the problem <br/>\nwould go away.  Maybe she just sat in the house all day.  Maybe she <br/>\nmodeled TV watching.  Dr Phil gave really bad advice, in my <br/>\nopinion.  He could have told her to make the yard more inviting to <br/>\nhim.  He could have told her to go out and plant a vegetable garden <br/>\nwith him since the yard had so much direct sun.  Not just take away <br/>\nthe one thing he likes and leave him with only the yucky yard.

I think his advice takes a middle road, doesn&#39;t go as far as I wish it would but is probably new and unfamiliar to much of his audience. He&#39;s stated over and over that he will not advocate spanking, that children&#39;s feeling are to be considered important and that modeling behaviour for kids is very important. He&#39;s also been reasonable on topics I don&#39;t agree with him on like co-sleeping. On one episode he stated his opinion of co-sleeping (against) but brought up that many pediatricians think it&#39;s a very healthy thing to do (he mentioned Dr. Sears) and provided pro-cosleeping links on his website. He&#39;s got some good ideas about kids and sex education (talk about it early and often) as well that I&#39;m betting are new to many viewers. <br/>\n      He&#39;s rarely got parenting advice that&#39;s new to me or that I want to use but I think he&#39;s a welcome voice and bridge to gentler ideas about raising kids. If he WERE as radical as most of us, I&#39;m betting he wouldn&#39;t be as popular and many of those parents who practice hard and controling parenting would simply dismiss him rather than listen. He&#39;s not where we are but I&#39;m betting he&#39;ll be responsible for helping more than a few parents journey over to our side of the parenting issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":144190534,"authorName":"Sondra Carr","from":"&quot;Sondra Carr&quot; &lt;sondracarr@...&gt;","profile":"sondra66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Change and growth/Dr.Phil","postDate":"1096475666","msgId":99986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDIwMWM0YTY0MiQyZmUxNjcxMCQ2NTAxYThjMEB5b3VyMndwMjFuM296Nz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTI5MTYxNzE0LktBSEoyNzM3MC5tdGE5LmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4="},"prevInTopic":99985,"nextInTopic":99989,"prevInTime":99985,"nextInTime":99987,"topicId":99972,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is so funny - so many times I find that I read topics here and think - wow - I felt like that and when I talked about it with other people they had no","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1835458880\">This is so funny - so many times I find that I read topics here and think -<br/>\nwow - I felt like that and when I talked about it with other people they had<br/>\nno clue where I was coming from. In unschooling forums I&#39;m finding all these<br/>\npeople more similar to me. I never liked Dr. Phil - especially the parenting<br/>\nstuff - it was so counter-intuitive to my experience as a mother and tried<br/>\nto fit every child into a strict framework. I also was a little more lenient<br/>\nin my judgment of his handling of adults but it still leaves an icky<br/>\nfeeling. Not quite the violent soul-vomitting that I experience when I am<br/>\ncaught in the car with a devotee of Dr. Laura but a little hint of the same<br/>\nsource. <br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be great to have a really radical unschooler giving advice on<br/>\nnational TV?
