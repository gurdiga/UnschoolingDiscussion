(The implication <br/>\nof the title of the classes is that if you don&#39;t do it THIS way it isn&#39;t <br/>\nGod&#39;s Way).<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you been to their web-site? Checked out their discussion boards?  It is <br/>\nfull of mothers who are in turmoil asking questions about how to raise their <br/>\nkids.

I have sat many hours in tears reading how mother&#39;s <br/>\nwere worried that the child seemed listless, never smiled, was fussy a lot, <br/>\nand they were tempted to give up nursing all together because it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoyable - the baby needed to eat to early.  There is NO education in these <br/>\nbooks about breast milk.  (at least the version I have - they have come under <br/>\nsuch fire, that they have SEVERAL revisions because of inaccurate medical <br/>\ninfo) - A child who is exclusively nursed generally CAN&#39;T go 3 to 4 hours <br/>\nwithout eating again.  Often, the baby needs to nurse every hour and a half.  <br/>\nEzzos have not (in the past) made provision for this.  Even my sister&#39;s book, <br/>\nwhich is the latest revision, discourages nursing past 6 months.  How awful!  <br/>\nEspecially since the medical community has come out and said 1 year is the <br/>\nMINIMUM they reccomend.  As far as the GKGW for older kids, it really is a <br/>\n&quot;formula&quot;.  I don&#39;t believe God intended us to use a &quot;formula&quot; in raising our <br/>\nkids when he said &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is <br/>\nold he will not depart from it.&quot;  My studying on this verse leads me to <br/>\nbelieve that we should train our children according to their personalities, <br/>\ntheir own natural &quot;bent&quot;.

I would like to say<br/>\nthat I agree with you wholeheartedly about breastfeeding.  I only breastfed my son<br/>\nfor 2 months, and I wish I had done it longer but I was only 19 and didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe &quot;tied down&quot;(I really didn&#39;t know what I was doing).  My 5 yr old is my<br/>\nstep-daughter, and my 2 yr old daughter I nursed for a year and I plan to do the<br/>\nsame with my 2month old.  I feel that breastfeeding is essential and the way God<br/>\ncreated infants to be fed.  I have friends of mine from church that nursed their<br/>\nkids for 2+ yrs.  I don&#39;t argue, at all, that it is the best thing for children to<br/>\nbe nursed.  I personally wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with nursing for more than 2<br/>\nyrs.  But that doesn&#39;t make it wrong to go longer!  Also, I have been known to<br/>\ntake my kids to bed with me.  I do not do it on a regular basis, but sometimes I<br/>\nam just too tired to sit up a breastfeed so I do it in bed and fall asleep with my<br/>\ndaughter attached.  I have no problem with it and neither does my husband.  Like I<br/>\nsaid I do not make a practice of it though.  I prefer to have my half of a bed to<br/>\nmyself. :-)<br/>\nMy 2 year old has been known to climb into bed with us if she continues to be<br/>\nfussy and not want to sleep, which is rare, but when she was young I would nurse<br/>\nher in bed and fall asleep with her, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also would like to say that I&#39;m sorry for the way your parents act with you.<br/>\nThey were wrong and I wish things could be different for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having a very hard time with the fact that so many people are judging the<br/>\nEzzo&#39;s on what they have heard other people say, instead of reading the material<br/>\nand then judging for themselves.  All of the posts I have read about what people<br/>\nthink of the Ezzo&#39;s methods have been based on what they have heard.  The way you<br/>\ndescribed your parents is NOT what the Ezzo&#39;s teach.  I have gone over my book<br/>\nagain since this whole thing started and I don&#39;t find anything in it that is even<br/>\nremotely along the same lines as people have said.  They DO NOT teach<br/>\nauthoritarian parenting at all.  They DO NOT teach parents to totally control<br/>\ntheir children and not let them think for themselves.  Quite the opposite.  All<br/>\nthe Ezzo&#39;s teach is how to train your children to think for themselves and make<br/>\ncorrect moral decisions.  I don&#39;t find that bad at all.  I want to have children<br/>\nwho, when I am not there, know the difference between right and wrong and make a<br/>\ndecision accordingly.  Morality is what they teach.  Not brainwashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the baby thing and the Ezzo&#39;s.  I wrote to Erin on another post about what<br/>\nthey teach.  Parent-Controlled Feeding is so different than what everyone thinks<br/>\nand has made it out to be.  Please find and read that post and it will explain how<br/>\nthey are not teaching what your parents did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI myself give my daughter a pacifier in the middle of the night if she wakes up.<br/>\nIf she goes back to sleep, YEAH.  If she won&#39;t, then she&#39;s really hungry and I<br/>\nfeed her.  I need my sleep to be able to make it through the day but I do not<br/>\nneglect my child.  If she really does need to be fed, I don&#39;t care what time it<br/>\nis, I will do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to correct something that you misunderstood.  When the parents have<br/>\n&quot;couch time&quot; they do not make their children sit down to watch.  The children are<br/>\nfree to do as they please but just not interrupt mommy and daddy while they talk<br/>\nfor 10-15 min..

It&#39;s <br/>\nbased<br/>\n on scripture and God.  To those of you who are going to read this, please<br/>\n don&#39;t take offense and think I am saying you have to follow this.  Erin asked<br/>\n me a question of what I have learned and the reasons to the way I believe.  I<br/>\n am simply answering her question.<br/>\n <br/>\n God intended our priorities to be:<br/>\n 1. God<br/>\n 2. husband/wife<br/>\n 3. children<br/>\n <br/>\n When we get away from that and put children before our husband/wife<br/>\n relationship and sometimes even before God we are getting into child-centered<br/>\n parenting.  Putting the child&#39;s feelings before anything, including their<br/>\n behavior.  Always making the child &#39;feel&#39; happy instead of making him<br/>\n responsible for his actions.  When the child leads what the family does<br/>\n instead of mom and dad.  Basically making the child the center of our<br/>\n existence.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith,<br/>\n      I have purposely kept out of this conversation until now.  I really <br/>\nhate confrontational topics, as in other loops, I have watched things <br/>\nescalate until there were hurt feelings, wrong interpretations, and out and <br/>\nout war.  However, I really feel as though I must step in on this one.  Also, <br/>\nlike you have said, I don&#39;t mean this<br/>\nas being against you.  I really hope you don&#39;t take offense either.  I just <br/>\nfeel very strongly, and even led by my faith in God, and the path we have <br/>\ntaken, to clarify some things.<br/>\n     Before I begin, I must tell you that you have the wrong understanding of <br/>\nwhat Attachment Parenting is.  It is &quot;not&quot; the child &quot;leading&quot; the family!  <br/>\nIt is not soooo<br/>\nchild-centered that the child is leading the family, controlling the family, <br/>\nor even the center of the family.  Quite opposite!!!!!  By allowing the child <br/>\nfreedom from being &quot;controlled&quot;, the parents are also free!!  The parents (if <br/>\nthey feel led to) can still put God First, Spouse Second, and Children Last.  <br/>\nThe difference is that we don&#39;t feel like there is a need to say &quot;Hey kids, <br/>\nyou must sit over there on the couch while your dad and I have alone time, <br/>\nbecause Dad must come first!&quot;  Instead by loving, respecting, and listening <br/>\nto each other (even the kids---especially making the kids a part of <br/>\nthat--they deserve respect and listening to just as much as an adult), it <br/>\njust comes natural.  It is like letting your kids know that there is enough <br/>\nlove to go around to each of them (whether you have two kids or fifteen).  <br/>\nThey feel so loved, accepted, and respected that they don&#39;t fear or resent <br/>\nthat you have love first for God and then your husband.<br/>\nWe show them by our actions every day, and by the things we talk about, that <br/>\nGod comes first because he is the Almighty, the Creator, the Savior of the <br/>\nWorld.  Then they know that our spouse comes next because we fell in love and <br/>\nmarried each other before we ever had the kids.  They know that, understand <br/>\nthat and respect it because they feel confident and secure in the love they <br/>\nget from us, and that is because they are being raised by &quot;Attachment <br/>\nParenting&quot; and &quot;Positive Discipline&quot;.<br/>\n     First of all, I am a Christian.  I am a very strong, devoted to Jesus <br/>\nChrist, even considered Fundamental Christian.  I was born in a Christian <br/>\nhome, so I have been a Christian all of my life.<br/>\n     Second of all, I was raised exactly the way this Ezzo guy is teaching in <br/>\nhis classes.  My parents are very much into this way of raising children <br/>\n(although they have never heard of this guys name).  I was born into that <br/>\ntime period where parents were told not to hold their children very much (it <br/>\nwould spoil them), to let them cry it out (it was good for them), to make <br/>\nthem sleep through the night in their own bedroom (we were fed cereal at 2 <br/>\nweeks of age, and then if we woke during the night, they would stick a <br/>\npacifier in our mouths to make us go back to sleep), we were spanked even as <br/>\nbabies (to stress &quot;no&quot; to us and teach us what not to do), we were fed every <br/>\n4 hours (not ever in between to matter how hungry we got--we were to be <br/>\ntrained to eat at the proper time), we were potty trained early (my mother <br/>\nloves to tell the story of starting potty training me at 9 months of age.  If <br/>\nI had an &quot;accident&quot;, I was paddled for it), we were never allowed to give our <br/>\nopinions about anything (that was &quot;mouthing off&quot; and we were smacked across <br/>\nthe mouth for that), we spent our days in playpens and bouncers.  Our parents <br/>\nboth worked and we went to babysitters (they didn&#39;t have all the daycares <br/>\nlike they do now).  I was lucky, because our babysitters were our <br/>\ngrandparents or an aunt.<br/>\n     Anyway, my parents and me and my brother all had alot of stuggles once <br/>\nwe became older.  My brother and I resented the fact that we were not allowed <br/>\nopinions of our own.  We hated being smacked or spanked for every little <br/>\nthing (half of the time we didn&#39;t even know what we had done wrong.  We were <br/>\nalways &quot;flinching&quot; and afraid of being hit, because we didn&#39;t know what we <br/>\nwere doing to cause it.  We lived in a type of fear, because we couldn&#39;t ever <br/>\ntell for sure if we were doing something right or wrong.  Yet, my parents <br/>\nloved us!!  They weren&#39;t doing these things to abuse us or hurt us.  They <br/>\nactually thought that this was the way kids should be raised!<br/>\n     Now I am 39 years old.  I have four children of my own, and the oldest <br/>\nis 17 (almost 18).  My parents have insisted on trying to control my life <br/>\neven now.  They still think that &quot;respect&quot; for ones parents (like the bible <br/>\nsays) means that I should automatically obey and follow their opinions on <br/>\neverything.  Instead of spanking me, now they say I am stupid, or I am not <br/>\nusing my head.  They call me stubborn and say that I have never listened!  <br/>\nThis all came about because they didn&#39;t like my homeschool methods!  (They <br/>\nwere both public school teachers).  They also don&#39;t like the way I keep <br/>\nhouse, or the way I raise my kids, or my ideas on what is right or wrong, we <br/>\neven disagree about some of the things in the bible.  I tend to take the <br/>\nbible very literally (but by literal, it means I study and try to find out <br/>\nwhat the Greek or Hebrew words really meant, because alot of times their <br/>\nmeaning is very different than ours).  Finally, I had to lovingly (but <br/>\nfirmly) tell my parents that I am an adult, I am 39 and I have to live my own <br/>\nlife!!  They were livid!!!  They shouted and screamed at me in front of my <br/>\nchildren and some friends that were over (I had just got out of the hospital <br/>\nafter having a hysterectomy, so there were people over trying to help me).<br/>\nMy friends sat me down and finally opened my eyes that my parents were <br/>\nactually abusing me---even if they thought they were doing it out of love.  I <br/>\nhave noticed that alot of parents who raised their kids in the way this Ezzo <br/>\nguy teaches, do not want to give up control of their kids when they are <br/>\ngrown.  And that is what it is all about CONTROL.<br/>\n     Now to try to get on to my story.  When my first son was born in 1982, I <br/>\nstarted off raising him in much the way I was raised.  After all, that is the <br/>\nway I was raised, my friends were raised, and it was the way our church <br/>\ntaught.  The difference was that I did try to breastfeed him (I had <br/>\ndifficulties with him latching on however--he has a tongue thrust problem-and <br/>\nI had cracked and bleeding nipples.  Unfortunately the only La Leche League I <br/>\ncould get hold of was long distance, we had no groups by us at that time, so <br/>\nI finally gave up) and I did hold him all the time---against all the advice <br/>\nthat I was spoiling him.  But I did spank my son for disobeying and I did <br/>\nmake sure that he always obeyed me.  My mother was always pointing out to me <br/>\nthat I should always be the one in control (there is that word <br/>\nagain!!!!---see it is about control!) and not my child.<br/>\n     When my 2nd child was born 4 years later, I was still raising them the <br/>\nsame way.  Since I had trouble nursing the first time, I didn&#39;t even try with <br/>\nthe 2nd child.<br/>\nHowever, as I watched him become a toddler, I began to be troubled with the <br/>\nway I was raising my children.  I was struggling with my parents having so <br/>\nmuch control over us (I was 25 and I had never told my parents to let us make <br/>\nour own decisions.  They told us which house we should buy.  They told my <br/>\nhusband to go back to school---and he did, although he told me that he really <br/>\nresented their interference, and he thought I should &quot;cut the apron strings&quot;, <br/>\nand they told us how to raise our kids.)  I was very much under the influence <br/>\nof my parents, and I was really starting to resent it.  I felt much like a <br/>\npuppet on a string!<br/>\n     When my 3rd child was born, I had decided to make some changes.  I had <br/>\nno support group or even friends that believed in the way I was deciding to <br/>\ngo.  I had never even read about it, but my new pediatrician was very much <br/>\ninto breastfeeding and letting your baby sleep with you.  I was excited by <br/>\nthe concept and I decided to do that with my son.  Well I had alot of <br/>\nopposition!!  My parents and everyone else around me pushed me to not nurse <br/>\nlong, please don&#39;t nurse out in public, please don&#39;t continue to sleep with <br/>\nyour baby--you will suffocate him!!, please quit nursing on demand--you will <br/>\nspoil him and he won&#39;t be trained right.  Well thank goodness, for once I was <br/>\nstubborn enough to ignore everyone and follow my own instincts!!!<br/>\nI wish that I had even followed them longer than I did, because unfortunately <br/>\nI gave in under pressure and quit nursing him at nine months (it looked so <br/>\nawful to nurse him when he was so old!!!!---everyone kept telling me!)  <br/>\nHowever, I continued to pray and study my bible and question God about the <br/>\nway I was raising my children.  I was still spanking them and &quot;controlling&quot; <br/>\nthem and things just didn&#39;t feel right!  My children would get angry and <br/>\nrebel against the control, and I would get angry and try even harder to <br/>\ncontrol them!  I knew that my Christian friends and family all said that that <br/>\nwas the way Christians should raise their kids, but it sure didn&#39;t feel <br/>\nChristian to me.  I could not imagine Jesus Christ ever treating a child this <br/>\nway!<br/>\n      Anyway, after much praying and thinking, I decided to take this even <br/>\nfarther with my fourth child.  I nursed her until she was 18 months old (I <br/>\nwould have gone farther, but I was pregnant again, and the OB told me to quit <br/>\nbecause I was having problems.  I really regret quitting, since it hurt both <br/>\nme and my daughter to quit before we were ready, and then I still lost the <br/>\nbaby anyway a few weeks later), I allowed her to sleep with me all the time, <br/>\nI kept her on me buy wearing her in a cloth front baby carrier, and I fed her <br/>\non demand and she never took a pacifier---she used me as one instead, so <br/>\nthere were times it seemed like she never quit nursing :-).<br/>\nIt was wonderful and I loved it!<br/>\n     Anyway, my parents hated it!  Especially when we began to quit spanking <br/>\nour kids and allowing them more decision making.  My mother said that we <br/>\nwould lose control!!  You know what though?  We haven&#39;t lost any &quot;control&quot;.  <br/>\nWe are still the parents, so when it comes to big monumental decisions, we <br/>\nstill make them.  Our kids can&#39;t go out and get drunk, or have sex, or walk <br/>\nout in front of a car--just because we dont try to &quot;control&quot; their lives and <br/>\nmake them obey.  They know that there are some things that we know would hurt <br/>\nthem and they take our word for it,<br/>\nHowever, I have noticed that the younger two children are much more at peace <br/>\nwith themselves, they are happier and closer knit to me, they care alot about <br/>\nthe feelings of the people around them, and they have been TONS more <br/>\nhealthier than the older two.  I really feel like this was because of <br/>\nAttachment parenting.  (Unfortunately, even though we had began to practice <br/>\nthis, I wasn&#39;t aware there was a term for it until a year ago.  By then my <br/>\nyoungest was 7 years old!!  A little late for a support group during the <br/>\nfact!).  As a matter of fact, when we started this, my older two were too old <br/>\nto really benefit.  Besides our infant daughter, we had a 3 yr. old, a 6 yr <br/>\nold and a 10 yr. old.  Now I have really regretted not starting with the <br/>\nAttachment parenting when our first child was born.  It was too late to have <br/>\nthe 6yr old and the 10 yr old come back to bed with us.  They were happy <br/>\nsharing a bunk bed with each other.  However, we did start the &quot;positive <br/>\ndiscipline&quot; and more listening and allowing them to tell us how they felt.  <br/>\nThere has been such a change in my kids!!!  There is not so much tension and <br/>\nrebelling at authority.  They don&#39;t have to worry about being hit or spanked <br/>\nwhen they do something we don&#39;t like.  However, I am constantly being told by <br/>\nmy parents (although they wouldn&#39;t admit that they were being raised right), <br/>\nby my friends, and by strangers and people at church that my kids are so well <br/>\nbehaved!!!  They are also amazed at how well they treat each other!!<br/>\n     I really wish that I could have had more children!  Unfortunately, I had <br/>\ntwo miscarriages after our 4th child was born.  I also had alot of &quot;problems&quot; <br/>\nuntil finally I had a hysterectomy.  Now that is another big regret!!!!!  I <br/>\nwish that I had looked into alternative treatments and medicine and maybe now <br/>\nI would have more kids!!  If I could have had more (even by adoption), I <br/>\nwould practice attachment parenting.  I am a very firm believer in it, as I <br/>\nhave seen the consequences from both sides!  I would constantly recommend <br/>\nAttachment Parenting, breastfeeding, and no hysterectomies (unless absolutely <br/>\nnecessary-like cancer) to everyone.Believe me, the children raised with <br/>\nAttachment Parenting are much better behaved than those raised in such a <br/>\nstrict manner.  And kids raised by Attachment Parenting are NOT controlling <br/>\ntheir parents!  Believe me, I know!  God still comes first in our lives, and <br/>\nI teach that to my kids by my actions not just words!!!  Then my husband <br/>\nstill comes 2nd.  This my kids also see by actions.  They see us walk off <br/>\nonto our acreage and take walks into our woods holding hands, or having our <br/>\narms wrapped around each other, while we have our heads close together <br/>\ntalking.  They see us smiling, laughing, teasing, and kissing each other.  <br/>\nThey see us go out on a &quot;date&quot; every once in awhile--just because we want to <br/>\nbe together.  My kids have no reason to resent this, because we don&#39;t make <br/>\nthem sit down and let mom and dad have their time together!!--instead we <br/>\nspend so much time laughing and loving as a &quot;family&quot; that it is natural that <br/>\ntheir parents would love each other and spend time alone.  After all, their <br/>\nparents were together before the children were ever in the picture!!  Last <br/>\ncomes the children.  But we include them in almost everything we do <br/>\n(homeschooling, church, going out to eat, going on trips, etc) because we <br/>\nENJOY spending time with our children.  We enjoy playing with them, learning <br/>\nwith them, talking with them and listening to them.  It is wonderful not to <br/>\nfeel like I have to &quot;control&quot; them.  Now that I am away from that, and I have <br/>\nseen the wonderful consequences of this new way of life, I realize how <br/>\n&quot;silly&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; it is to feel like we have to control our kids!  <br/>\nWhere in the bible does it say to &quot;control&quot; anybody?  The only time I <br/>\nremember reading about &quot;control&quot; it dealt with ourselves. LIke controlling <br/>\nour tongue or our actions!<br/>\n     As far as finding in the bible about Attachment Parenting, I am sure <br/>\nthat there are some references to it if someone looks for them.  Off hand, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t come up with Chapter and Verse.  I do know that there were instances <br/>\nwere things are suggested, like Solomon (I believe it was) whose mother <br/>\nweaned him before giving him to Gods work.  If you study Greek and Hebrew <br/>\ntranslations, you will learn that it was &quot;typical&quot; to wean children from the <br/>\nbreast quite late (like age 4-6 yrs old).  You will also learn that children <br/>\nwent every where with their parents and worked along side of them.  They were <br/>\nnot shipped off to school.  As a matter of fact, only boys were sent to <br/>\nschool, and usually they were about 12 or 13 yrs old by then.<br/>\n      Because of my interest in historic facts about families, I have read <br/>\nabout families back then.  It seems as though, by the things I have read, the <br/>\npoor families of those times lived in one or two rooms.  Alot of the time, <br/>\nthe whole family shared one bed, even the teenagers!!   (Voila, the family <br/>\nbed was born 1,000&#39;s of years ago!).  Women alot of times wore their children <br/>\non makeshift slings worn on their hip or back while they worked.  Children <br/>\nwere very involved in family life.  As a matter of fact, it seems like it was <br/>\nthe last couple of centuries that have become so &quot;anti-family&quot;.  So it seems <br/>\nto me that &quot;attachment parenting&quot; is natural, Christian, and a custom from <br/>\nway back--even from the time of Christ!<br/>\n    Well, as you can tell from the long, long post that this topic is very <br/>\nnear and dear to my heart.  Honey, I have been where you are.  I know the <br/>\npressures from some of the Christians about the &quot;correct Christian way&quot; of <br/>\nchild rearing.  Unfortunately, I have also walked down both paths, and I know <br/>\nwhich path is working the right way and feels right.  I feel so much that <br/>\nthis is the Christian way of raising kids.  I go to a very Fundamentalist, <br/>\nBible preaching church.  My church is very large (over 600 people), but I now <br/>\nknow many, many Christians who also believe this way.  Before you jump into <br/>\nthis, please, please pray alot more about it.  Check it out more fully.<br/>\nI have heard from my Christian circles about how awful this new teaching from <br/>\nthis Ezzo guy really is.  Most Christians I know now, would never take that <br/>\npath.  But most of all, I know first hand how damaging that can be to raise <br/>\nyour children like that.  First of all, I know how much it has hurt me.  <br/>\nSecond, and worse of all to me, I know how much it hurt my own children to be <br/>\nraised like that.  It is a regret that will always bother me and I am so <br/>\nsorry for it.  I really would hate for you to also look back and regret what <br/>\nyou have done to your kids.  All of us are only telling you these things <br/>\nbecause we care!!!  It is not to hurt you or offend you.  We really are <br/>\nafraid that you may make a mistake that you will regret for the rest of your <br/>\nlife!!!
