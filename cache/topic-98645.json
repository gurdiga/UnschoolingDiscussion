And, they become increasingly more<br/>\ndifficult to get together with because of the all-encompassing school<br/>\nmonster which holds them captive from early morning until early evening and<br/>\nthen we only get to see them on weekends! Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have virtually no unschooled (or homeschooled, for the matter!) teens in<br/>\nour community. . . several younger ones, but only two teenage friends for<br/>\nmy youngest son and none for my older two! Boo hoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only silver lining in this cloud is that the beaches are empty! - my<br/>\nteens get all the waves! <br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Lee<br/>\nNORTH COUNTRY FARMS<br/>\n~an eco-tourism destination~<br/>\n P.O.
