About two years ago we got involved in more, Brownies,<br/>\nacting classes, swimming lessons, ice skating. It was fun but was also<br/>\nbeginning to put stress on us financially and time wise. Since we work from<br/>\nhome, it was very hard to have to in the middle of a project to rush off to<br/>\nsome scheduled event.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started cutting back. The kids were good about understanding that we<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do everything they might want to do, and we let them be involved in<br/>\npicking what was most important to them. (I tend to prefer activities that I<br/>\ncan also participate in, so ice skating stayed on the list ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good way to let them decide is to set a budget. Let them know how<br/>\nmuch is available to spend and how much the different activities cost. The<br/>\nbudget doesn&#39;t have to be money, you could set a number of hours or days per<br/>\nweek for outside activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes less is more, and the kids can really benefit from being less busy<br/>\n(and having a parent who is less worn out from shuttling them all over the<br/>\nplace).

I think we<br/>\nreally just need to focus more on our family, and less on externally<br/>\nstructured activities. I believe it will be a positive experience for all<br/>\nof us, and improve the health of our family relationships.<br/>\n\tWe really need to work on cooperation, family team spirit and such.<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking of using The 7 Habits as our &quot;curriculum&quot; for at<br/>\nleast several months. Otherwise, I might just hop on that plane to<br/>\nBermuda. <br/>\n\tIn addition, last year&#39;s activities required spending several hundred<br/>\ndollars, and we&#39;ve had some bad luck with health and injuries this year,<br/>\nwhich has created a financial problem for us. And, we have a whole room<br/>\nfull of (paid for) art & craft supplies waiting to be used--if we&#39;re ever<br/>\nhome long enough. It seems wise to cut back on expenses and utilize the<br/>\nresources immediately at hand.<br/>\n\tHowever, my children are upset with this decision; they want to continue<br/>\nas before. My question: Am I unschooling if I refuse to give my kids the<br/>\nclasses and clubs they want? Has anyone else faced similar situations?<br/>\nAny suggestions for making the transition easier?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shay<br/>\n<br/>\nFOLC homeschool support group:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/page/folcfolks\">http://expage.com/page/folcfolks</a> <br/>\n&quot;Va.
