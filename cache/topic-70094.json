We&#39;ve been committed to unschooling for several months now and<br/>\nalready my thinking has changed radically. It&#39;s like I have been blindfolded<br/>\nmost of my life and now that it&#39;s been removed I am truly seeing. I am so<br/>\nglad we are doing this now while the kids are young. I&#39;m excited for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have loved reading everyone&#39;s thoughts about what to expect as our kids<br/>\nget older. I think it has heaps to do with the state of our relationship<br/>\nwith them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about all the times in the past when I have interrupted<br/>\nmy kids and told them what to do ALL the time, been abrupt while giving<br/>\norders and generally not taking them into consideration when organizing the<br/>\nday, something you seem to end up doing when you school-at-home. How could I<br/>\nexpect that I wouldn&#39;t receive that same disrespect and lack of interest<br/>\nfrom them when they get older?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy relationship with my kids is so much better now that I am treating them<br/>\nlike people and I know that they will be able to talk to me about what&#39;s<br/>\nhappening in their lives 5-10 years from now and that they will listen to<br/>\nwhat I have to say because I can see them doing it now. Because they know I<br/>\nam interested and I am not going to be angry with them or make judgments.<br/>\nThey know from experience that I will listen and be gentle with them. And<br/>\nall this has happened in just a few short months. WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I keep saying it but thank you everyone. Life is so much better! This<br/>\nlist is one of the reasons that it is so.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I have an almost 15 year old who is just starting to venture in the teen social groups. She asked a boy in her drama class out (she said I could share this) but before she did asked me what I thought,told me what she was going to do, asked my advice on the best way, gave me her ideas etc.. She sounded reasonable, calm and confident in her whole discussion. She cared what I thought but likely would have done it anyway. I was marvelling with my dh celebrating her growth then suddenly wondered if I was crazy. This could lead to a whole bunch of stuff I might not think was great so why wasn&#39;t I initially freaked out. I realised it was because she talks to me and has given me no reason to worry about her choices or decisions. I am aware she may need to experiment in ways I might not like but because we trust each other I know we can always work it out for both of us.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maureen<br/>\n        Yahoo!
