My m-i-l was concerned about the socialization issue too.  My <br/>\ndaughter is 9 y/o and has been in catholic and public school and an in-home <br/>\nday care.  She also has many friends around our neighborhood and around the <br/>\nhomes of my family and friends.  I just started homeschooling her 2 days ago. <br/>\n I am letting her do her own thing (as well as some-UGH- worksheets, for <br/>\nhubby&#39;s sake).  My m-i-l thinks she should go to the ps here in town.  My <br/>\ndaughter learns more by just being home and doing what she&#39;s interested in.  <br/>\nOur schools here have at least 25 different cultures in which the kids only <br/>\nspeak their language.  How would my dd learn or socialize in that situation?  <br/>\nI love learning along with her.  I&#39;ll tell you, I went to catholic school for <br/>\n12 years.  I learned that religion had to do with every subject.  (if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t do your homework, God will punish you!).  I learned that I could buy a <br/>\nfake id that I could buy alcohol with (those computer students were smart).  <br/>\nI learned that drugs could be bought in the parking lot (dad, I need more <br/>\nlunch money for an xtra milk today).  I learned that if you told the nun that <br/>\nyou were going to become a nun, she would believe you were an angel (while <br/>\nthe whole class laughed!)  I learned these and so many other things in <br/>\nschool.  No wonder I&#39;d rather have my child at home with me where I can keep <br/>\nher safe and answer her questions about the dangers of drugs and other <br/>\nthings.

I doubt they did it by treating <br/>\nthe kids with respect, which I think is the only way to teach *real* <br/>\nrespect.  In other words, I think what usually passes for respect is <br/>\nobedience and politeness rather than true respect.

But should we? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I personally have worked hard to get rid of most of the oughts and shoulds <br/>\nin my life.

I think the book was &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;. It is the only book I actually own that would vaguely relate to the subject. She stopped questioning me after that. Now she only asks &quot;How&#39;s homeschooling going?&quot; or &quot;Did you start schooling for the boys yet?&quot; Then I explained that we homeschool year round b/c we unschool. I even offered to print off something for her to read about unschooling. She declined and took my word for it. But she doesn&#39;t nag like before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my family members... A few of my siblings (17 of them) voiced their concerns and I was happy to respond to them. They don&#39;t meddle as much as the moms do. <br/>\n<br/>\nMom Carol in MT thinks it&#39;s cool. But she&#39;s more like I am. Actually, that side of the family thinks it&#39;s wonderful. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Mom Deb asked questions and asked when I was sending him back to school and why was I doing this and on and on... I finally just told her that if she refused to read up on it, then the it was off topic and I&#39;d gladly hang up on her if she asked again. Although I ticked her off, she she hasn&#39;t asked again... she also hasn&#39;t read anything on homeschooling, unschooling, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nMom Carol in TX wasn&#39;t happy about it at first. She questioned me and really voiced her discontent with it. She would say things like &quot;Well, we&#39;ll see how you&#39;re doing when they test him.&quot; Well, I can get around the tests, which didn&#39;t make her happy. She asked if I was going to homeschool them forever... I said &quot;Gosh NO! Once their 18, they are free to do as they wish.&quot; :) And she continued with the socialization thing, implying that I kept them locked in the house day in and day out... &quot;It&#39;s nice you guys are going to the fireworks with friends, those kids need to get out and be around people.&quot; I told her we do that PLENTY! In fact, that is everyones big concern but some won&#39;t listen. I emailed her website after website about homeschooling and how healthy it is (I try to stay positive). She harped and moaned and complained... Then my sister got hooked on drugs, lost custody of her kids, dropped off the face of the planet only to reappear in the county jail for assault on an officer, hit and run, drugs in possession, warrants out for her (one is for felony assault on an elderly), and failure to appear in court.
