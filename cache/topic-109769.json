This is VERY limiting and nobody thinks this  <br/>\nis the direction that will really work, in the future, other than for  <br/>\nvery limited purposes.<br/>\nThe other is building the ability to learn into the robot so that it  <br/>\nresponds to &quot;bumping into its environment&quot; by creating its OWN  <br/>\nprogramming. This is the way real intelligence happens and the way  <br/>\nhumans really learn, It is unpredictable and exciting.<br/>\n<br/>\nUNSCHOOLED robots!
