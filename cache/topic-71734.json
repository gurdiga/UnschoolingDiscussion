On one hand, I totally believe that I should not paint a pretty unrealistic picture for my kids by weeding through everything that they read and see on TV. I let them watch tv shows and all sorts of movies. However when it comes to info I want them to know that there are all sorts of other sources out there to learn and get correct and informative facts from. For example, when I grew up my dad was a conservative republican. He watched one news program, read one newspaper and informed me of one way of thinking. He sent me to a very conservative Catholic all girls hs and taught me to be strongly pro life (or you were basically a murderer) so naturally at 18 I registered as a REpublican and voted for Bush (senior) in 1992. Anyhow, to make a long story short I entered college soon thereafter and became exposed to all sorts of new ideas and thoughts and media outlets and sources.

What I meant was that in *their* world I am the most liberal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I agree with you whole heartedly.  I could care less whether my way is &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;.  Its for real in the real world. And that is the only thing that will really prepare them and give them a chance at protecting themselves from what is REALLy out there (whether we want it to be or not).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Making our homes a bubble is not going to stop our kids from becoming aware of information.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I suppose the argument goes that if we wait until they are &quot;older&quot; then the information is better handled.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it depends on how it is presented, and who is helping them navigate their way through it, at *any* age.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That doesn&#39;t mean I want my kids out there practicing what they hear about.

On one hand, I totally believe that I should not paint a pretty unrealistic picture for my kids by weeding through everything that they read and see on TV. I let them watch tv shows and all sorts of movies. However when it comes to info I want them to know that there are all sorts of other sources out there to learn and get correct and informative facts from. For example, when I grew up my dad was a conservative republican. He watched one news program, read one newspaper and informed me of one way of thinking. He sent me to a very conservative Catholic all girls hs and taught me to be strongly pro life (or you were basically a murderer) so naturally at 18 I registered as a REpublican and voted for Bush (senior) in 1992. Anyhow, to make a long story short I entered college soon thereafter and became exposed to all sorts of new ideas and thoughts and media outlets and sources. What a joy it was to begin to have political discussions that were both from the left and the right. So today as I raise my daughters in this world of belly button peirced, high heeled ten year olds on TV on one station and wars brewing on the next station, I try to have dialogues with them about what each side is thinking. For example, what was Mr. Bush thinking when he sent our troops to war? Well, I would tell Molly that there are several ways to look at this issue and explain to her that she could listen to NPR and MSNBC and then we could talk about it, and yes, she will ask for my opinion (which is very liberal now) and I will tell her but I will also try to relay to her the importance of free speech and opinion in this country and try to engage her to formulate her own opinion. I would hate for her to grow up thinking that everything that was in the media was necessarily factually based on truth when in fact it is not.

LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the moms teaches school, and she was a big help and she&#39;s a wonderful woman...but her approach toward difficult childhood situations is very different from mine &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we had some nice conversations too.  I guess when you unschool, you&#39;re bound to find yourself in situations like this where you have to leave your differences of opinion at the door :o).  It just wasn&#39;t the time or place to take issue with things (most of the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point, the adults had a small amount of time where we just talked.  We got to talking about how parents can raise their kids so they didn&#39;t have to be exposed to some things so young (like language, sex, etc).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic consensus was that it can&#39;t be done, and as parents, it just falls to us to help them navigate their way through whatever information they come across, and give them as much guidance as our value systems dictate. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one mom there who felt that she really should not have to have these kinds of converations with her kids at their ages, and I think she just basically wishes every other parent agreed with how she views things so she wouldn&#39;t have to always undo the damage she feels is being done.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(To be fair, I think we *all* feel that way about any kind of damage we feel is being done to our kids...we probably just differ on what we consider damaging)<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, she teaches 7th grade in public school. I was surprised at her feelings that she should not have to have these conversations with her kids at so young an age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso interesting was that all of these moms except me have their kids in public school :o), not that it matters, my kids are just as exposed as theirs are!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to REALLY put it all in perspective, I&#39;m the only one of us four women who actually has a teenager..a teen boy no less.  None of the other women have boys OR teens.  Their oldest daughters are in 4th grade.  I&#39;m sure that is the biggest reason why our parenting views may differ so much.  I&#39;m dealing with an &quot;almost adult&quot; and already know first hand that the best I can hope for is not control, but influence.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m probably the most liberal when it comes to these things, not so much because I *want* my kids exposed to so much, but because thats just the way it is and I&#39;m striving for a two way relationship with my kids in the midst of it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI found a new role for myself:  Assistant information processor.  I help my kids process all the information they receive.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71803,"nextTopicId":71678}}
