Not all that offer PPO advantages restrict you to the use of<br/>\na PPO, they just don&#39;t pay as much if you use someone who isn&#39;t a preferred<br/>\nprovider.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome offer group rates where each party chooses whether or not they want the<br/>\nPPO advantage.  Those that choose not to have it either pay a bigger % as a<br/>\nco-pay or they have a larger deductible.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can configure your group policy, particularly if you are dealing with a<br/>\nnationwide organization, to fit each region individually also, which is what<br/>\nwe did when we set them up for various reservation groups.
