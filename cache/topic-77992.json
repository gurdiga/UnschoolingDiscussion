I just heard from Kaycee (her prepaid cell phone is <br/>\none of the only cell phone&#39;s working PERIOD!  The only other one is Don <br/>\nWhittrock&#39;s --  the person in charge of the Junior Volunteer Program at Cin. Mus. <br/>\nCenter & his is a contract phone).  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s have a GREAT TIME!  Today, they got to go to the TOP of a mountain <br/>\nwhere they &quot;played&quot; in the snow, & found an ice cave.  Then, they went back down <br/>\nto the desert (one girl got sick from the heat, but is OK now).  She said &quot;she <br/>\ncan&#39;t wait for us to see the video she took&quot; (I let her take my camcorder; <br/>\nit&#39;s old, hasn&#39;t been used in years, so I do hope it works still) and I said, <br/>\n&quot;Oh, so you are ready to come home.&quot;  Her response:  &quot;no, I&#39;ll just ship the tape <br/>\nto you!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dig is going very well.  They have bones that were just found, and must <br/>\nbe plastered first before being dug from the ground.  Very long, tedious, work, <br/>\napparently.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said the weather out there has been great!  No thunderstorms or rain, <br/>\nwhich they&#39;ve been having lots of lately!  And, of course, she just couldn&#39;t say <br/>\nenough about how beautiful Montana, the Big Horn Mountain Range--where the Dig <br/>\nsite is, and everything else in general is!  Can&#39;t wait to see the video <br/>\n(hoping we can have it transferred onto VCR, then DVD) and pictures.  Maybe by the <br/>\ntime she gets home & we get the film developed, I&#39;ll be able to have the <br/>\nscanner back up and running and I can post some of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds as if all is going well for her.  I&#39;m so glad she thinks enough of <br/>\nme to call.  It&#39;s nice when your kids do that!<br/>\n<br/>\nWill keep you all updated!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy<br/>\nPS:  If you got doubles of this e-mail, I apologize.  AOL is really messed up <br/>\nright now, & has been adding addresses (some there already, some not) to my <br/>\naddress book w/out me knowing.  I wanted to make sure I sent the update to all <br/>\nwho knew what is going on w/Kaycee!  I&#39;ll try to get this mess cleaned out in <br/>\nthe next couple of days!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe forfeit three-fouths of ourselves in order to be like other people.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Arthur Schopenhauer~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77948,"nextTopicId":77998}}
