I just joined the group yesterday, and thought I&#39;d introduce myself. <br/>\nI&#39;m Raine, wife to J for 12 years, homeschool mom to Alex, age 12, and Ashlyn, age 10. We live in Bakersfield, CA. <br/>\nWe&#39;ve homeschooled the past 7 years, not real strict, but still with some text/work books and such. Every once in a while I come back to an unschooling website, but I think I&#39;ve been too uptight and perfectionistic to take the plunge, up to this point. <br/>\nI joined the group to get workable ideas on how to integrate some, or all, of the child-led approach with my kids. The thought has struck me that... I&#39;m losing time with them. I want the last 6-10 years to be something that really builds them as people, before they step out into the world.
