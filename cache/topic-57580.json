Someone just sent this to me:<br/>\n************************************************************<br/>\nWhat is a Grandmother?<br/>\n<br/>\n What is a grandmother? ( taken from papers written by a class of 8 year<br/>\n olds), A grandmother is a lady who has no little children of her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n She likes other peoples. A grandfather is a man grandmother.<br/>\nGrandmothers<br/>\n don&#39;t have to do anything except be there when we come to see them.<br/>\n<br/>\n They are so old they shouldn&#39;t play hard or run. It is good if they<br/>\ndrive us<br/>\n to the store and have lots of quarters for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n When they take us for walks, they slow down past things like pretty<br/>\nleaves<br/>\n and caterpillars. They show us and talk to us about the color of the<br/>\nflowers<br/>\n and also don&#39;t step on &quot;cracks.&quot; They don&#39;t say, &quot;Hurry up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Usually grandmothers are fat, but not too fat to tie your shoes. They<br/>\nwear<br/>\n glasses and funny underwear.<br/>\n<br/>\n They can take their teeth and gums out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Grandmothers don&#39;t have to be smart. They have to answer questions like<br/>\n &quot;Why isn&#39;t God married?&quot; and How come dogs chase cats?&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n When they read to us, they don&#39;t skip. They don&#39;t mind if we ask for the<br/>\n same story over again.<br/>\n<br/>\n Everybody should try to have a grandmother, especially if you don&#39;t have<br/>\n television, because they are the only grown ups who like to spend time<br/>\n with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n They know we should have snack-time before bedtime and they say prayers<br/>\nwith us every time, and kiss us even when we&#39;ve acted bad. <br/>\n*************************************************************<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it great that we don&#39;t have to wait till we get old to act like<br/>\nGrandmothers! I sure hope my children have such happy memories of their<br/>\nchildhood.<br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57462,"nextTopicId":57559}}
