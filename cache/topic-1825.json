What it does is give you a chronic<br/>\ncase of said illness so that you become unable to contract an acute case.<br/>\nYour immune system is constantly under attack and constantly producing<br/>\nantibodies to fight diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, tetnus, pertussis<br/>\n(my kids have had this, no big deal for healthy children, we had an outbreak<br/>\nin northern Idaho a few years ago and 70% of those who contracted it had<br/>\nbeen vaccinated!! what is the point?), hepatitisB, and POLIO!! (I understand<br/>\nthat the only know cases of Polio in this country these days are a direct<br/>\nresult of vaccination). So, when you assault the developing immune system of<br/>\na baby with all of this you basically set them up for problems.  The reason<br/>\nthey have to keep going back for boosters--their immune system wasn&#39;t<br/>\ndeveloped enough in the first place to react in the desired way to the<br/>\nvaccinations.  So there they are with their immune systems so busy taking<br/>\ncare of all these chronic illnesses that it can&#39;t handle some of the other<br/>\nthings the world throws their way, like pet dander or peanuts or less than<br/>\nclean air.

That is, if you want<br/>\nto take a positive slant on that information.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I have also heard (from someone who used to work in the<br/>\nSocial Services here in Eastern Idaho) that child abuse is rampant in this<br/>\npart of the state.  I have also seen plenty (ok LOTS) of folks smoking with<br/>\ntheir kids in the car, not using sunblock, shouting at or striking their<br/>\nchildren, not using carseats, not that I think those are problems that are<br/>\nunique to this area, but I have noticed more of it here.  Apparently there<br/>\nis a big problem with people not using Carseats here.  They have radio<br/>\ncampaigns and seat givaways from the hospital and the fire department.  We<br/>\nnoticed it when we moved here.  We also noticed that they have a problem<br/>\nwith getting people to get their kids vaccinated!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was also surprised to find (after growing up in Northern California) that<br/>\nthere are ALL smoking resturaunts here.  I have yet to find one that is<br/>\nSmoke Free.  For us that is a big deal as both my older son and I have<br/>\nAsthma.  We sometimes have to get up and leave after being seated in a new<br/>\nrestaurant (one we have not been in before) if we discover that it is just<br/>\ntoo smokey.  I always ask to be seated as far away from their smoking<br/>\nsection as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of wonderful things about this area.  Small town atmosphere<br/>\nwith still a decent sized population.  A very nice zoo and library, lots of<br/>\nparks, playgrounds and city flower beds, a good semi-pro baseball team,<br/>\nYellowstone, Glacier National Park, and other areas nearby.  But I have to<br/>\nadjust to a mentality that is about 15 years (in the general populace)<br/>\nbehind the coastal areas and the big cities.
