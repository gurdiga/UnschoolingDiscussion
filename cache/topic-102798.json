We usually <br/>\npraise what we see as an act of self-expression and then stick the picture on the <br/>\nrefrigerator with a magnet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child continues to show interest, you might enroll her in an art class at some point <br/>\n(to develop some of the skills that make drawing more pleasurable and to learn other <br/>\nmedia). Or you might purchase an art book or drawing book like _Drawing on the Right <br/>\nSide of the Brain_ to help a stuck child (a child who suddenly hates that her work doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlook like the item she wants to draw) to get over the hump.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some reason, writing has been so ruined in school for so many of us, that unschoolers <br/>\nare often reluctant to give the same kind of support to the growing interest in writing that <br/>\nkids exhibit. Growing as a writer doesn&#39;t have to be schoolish at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut learning a bit about how to use punctuation, discovering new ways to write interesting <br/>\nopenings for a live journal or a story, understanding how to create vivid word pictures or <br/>\nanalogiesÂ—these skills enhance the enjoyment of writing as well as the sense of <br/>\nachievement in the finished product.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own approach to writing with my kids has been focused on supporting their forays into <br/>\nwriting (not creating artificial writing assignments). We&#39;ve done lots of freewriting, we&#39;ve <br/>\nkept copywork books (where you write down your favorite poetry, song lyrics, passages <br/>\nfrom books that you want to keep, refrigerator magnet quotes, etc.) and we&#39;ve written <br/>\nstories and keep live journals and send letters and all kinds of stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done a variety of dictation styles with interested kids (only the ones who enjoy it) <br/>\ndrawn from books they love to read. I even make my own dictation sheets called reverse <br/>\ndictation where I leave all the punctuation out of the passage, misspell a few words and let <br/>\nthe kids try to edit the page. They get a penny for every correction they make that works. <br/>\n(They love this.) The problem with dictation is if it becomes a rigid practice that is &quot;done&quot; <br/>\nto the child rather than the fun of having this puzzle called &quot;a written passage&quot; that is <br/>\nneeding punctuation supplied by an interested child. It ought to be a game, not a <br/>\ndiscipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also pay twenty-five cents to any kid who finds a typo in printed matter (local <br/>\nnewspapers can cost you quite a bit, lol). It keeps them attentive to what they read and <br/>\nthey love to &quot;catch&quot; errors made by paid professionals.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage and grammar and punctuation are games in our house and part of becoming a <br/>\nliterate adult. But there is nothing heavy-handed about it. It&#39;s as natural as supplying new <br/>\nart pencils and paper, models and still lifes to draw. It&#39;s as natural as playing games that <br/>\ncapitalize on math skills or scientific principles.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102793,"nextTopicId":102802}}
