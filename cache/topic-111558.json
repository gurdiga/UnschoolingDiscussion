My brother had  FAS,<br/>\nsomething that happens in the womb and sometimes no amount of  nurture<br/>\ncan overcome that.<br/>\nI think RU has the best chance for helping  those children heal though.<br/>\nMy brother got the whole Ritalyn, schooling  crap and whether or not<br/>\nthat&#39;s a cause, it sure was a contributing factor  in his life<br/>\ntoday...which is all about prison at this  point.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe are foster parents, and have adopted 3 of our foster kids, and are in  the <br/>\nprocess of getting full custody of our 10 yo foster daughter.  The  first boy <br/>\nwe adopted had/has FAS and RAD.  It was a big struggle at first,  but the one <br/>\nthing that probably made the BIGGEST difference was pulling him out  of <br/>\nschool as soon as the adoption was final.  It lifted this huge weight  off of him <br/>\nand us.  He just couldn&#39;t handle the stifling environment and  needed freedom.  <br/>\nHe was always in trouble at school, it was awful.  We  know he will never be <br/>\n&quot;normal&quot; but he has come so incredibly far.  He&#39;s a  very happy, busy kid.  <br/>\nHis biggest joy is untangling things, finding things  no one else can seem to <br/>\nlocate, and &quot;fixing&quot; things.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other two boys had &quot;learning disabilities.&quot;  Since we took them  out of <br/>\nschool, that has changed, though one still struggles to read.  They  blossomed <br/>\nonce taken out of school.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAt this time, our two foster children are not bothered that they have to go  <br/>\nto school and the others get to stay home.  They do their homework if the  <br/>\nwant to, wear what they want to, go to sleep when they&#39;re tired, and do a good  <br/>\njob ot if.  Our oldest foster son is about to turn 18, and will go to live  <br/>\nwith family.  So soon, we won&#39;t have to live by the school&#39;s schedule, as  when <br/>\nwe get full custody, we&#39;ll be able to take her out of school.  For the  <br/>\nmeantime, she&#39;s OK with it.  She has been in horrible situations, including  almost a <br/>\nyear in hospitalization, so live in our home has been the most stable  thing <br/>\nin her life, probably since she was born.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think a radical unschooling family can be wonderful for children who&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen in foster care.  They&#39;ve lived with so many rules, so much &quot;system&quot;  that <br/>\ngiving them a lot of freedom to make mistakes and grow from them gives them  a <br/>\nchance to have a little control over their own world, something they&#39;ve not  <br/>\nhad in the past.  They were either controlled by abuse, or neglect, or the  <br/>\nsystem.<br/>\n <br/>\nSomething else:  I&#39;ve noticed through the years, that many of these  kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in strict, Christian or Fundamentalist homes.  We go  to Church <br/>\n(Mass), but our kids have a lot of freedom, they can have their own  interests, <br/>\nwatch most movies, dress the way they want.  To look at our home  you would <br/>\nnever think we&#39;re religious.  In that way, the  unschooling/relaxed lifestyle <br/>\nhas helped these kids tremendously.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If I were going to choose foster care or adoption, I would  be sure to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>only get children that were younger than my own children.  Messing up<br/>\nthe whole birth order thing ended up being really a difficult  dynamic<br/>\nin our family.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have to second this.  I would never recommend taking in a child  older than <br/>\nyour youngest.  The only reason we had the 17 yo is because we  had known him <br/>\na long time before he was in our home, and we knew his issues were  very <br/>\nminimal, and he still has a good relationship with his father.  Still,  it was <br/>\nprobably not the best choice, and I&#39;d never do it again.  I just  wouldn&#39;t bring <br/>\na teen into my home, you just never know.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think Sandra did have a point.  To have a child for years and years  who <br/>\nhas to go to school while the rest of the family is having a ball,  could be <br/>\ncruel.  But with us, we were always open to adoption so there was  a light at the <br/>\nend of the tunnel for our kids.  After our 10 yo girl, we  don&#39;t plan on <br/>\nadopting any more, so we are not going to foster.  Sending  children from home to <br/>\nhome is the most damaging thing foster care does to kids,  so I really suggest <br/>\nonly doing it if you&#39;re in it for the long haul.<br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Foster Care","postDate":"1138575909","msgId":111602,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4MEMxQjhFLUNFMDUtNDY5OS04RUE5LUY1MUIwNkQ3MTNBNUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRyamZ2YSt0Y2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRyamZ2YSt0Y2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":111601,"nextInTopic":111603,"prevInTime":111601,"nextInTime":111603,"topicId":111558,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

No matter how much we wish that wasn&#39;t true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It does subside with care and such children become very healthy,<br/>\n&gt; active, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is a STRONG statement.

I know it isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir problems often subside with care and sometimes they even become<br/>\nvery healthy, active, etc. (not sure what the &quot;etc.&quot; includes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Surely you aren&#39;t suggesting that they are forever damaged and can<br/>\n&gt; never experience curiosity, intelligence, the need to love and be<br/>\n&gt; loved?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Barb, you said: &quot;all children are full of vitality, enthusiasm,<br/>\ncuriosity, love, intelligence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known, very very well, people who fostered and even adopted kids<br/>\n- they were sure that if they gave them a great family life, lots of<br/>\nlove, they would be able to undo the damage of fetal alcohol<br/>\nsyndrome, for example. Not so. A lifetime of difficulty and heartache<br/>\nis what they did get. And the adopted children&#39;s siblings have<br/>\ncontinued to have to deal with the problems into their own adulthoods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying people shouldn&#39;t do it - but that so many people go<br/>\ninto it with such unrealistic ideas - assuming that all children are<br/>\nfull of vitality, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, intelligence - and all<br/>\nthey need is a little loving care. Those here who have fostered/<br/>\nadopted kids know the truth - Reactive Attachment Disorder is<br/>\nextremely intractable - and living with a child who isn&#39;t trusting or<br/>\ntrustworthy is very difficult. Again - I appreciate and admire those<br/>\nwho do it. I know some of the heartache and hardship they face. And i<br/>\ndon&#39;t think those considering it should impose the risks on their<br/>\nother children - at least wait until they are grown.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt;<br/>\nYahoo!

There is a need, in every state for families <br/>\nto foster. Have you checked into it yet? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy three spent 4 years in foster care before we adopted them. <br/>\nAlthough they were in seperate foster homes the first year, they <br/>\nwere reunited in one foster home for the remaining three years. <br/>\nTheir foster parents were wonderful people who helped them through a <br/>\nlot of rejection, hurt and trauma. I am forever grateful to them for <br/>\ngoing above and beyond with my children. Our adoption was finalized <br/>\ntwo years ago and we have kept in contact with them throughout.

Would a compromise of some sort <br/>\nbetween the two be better for the child or worse?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would have to stay in school until they were adopted.

Unschooling is <br/>\nabout trust and trust takes time to be established. This is <br/>\nsomething we deal with regarding my oldest. He is unschooled, <br/>\nmeaning he doesn&#39;t do school (he&#39;s deschooing, defostering, healing) <br/>\nbut it&#39;s very, very difficult to extend that freedom into other <br/>\nareas because of the amount of trust on both sides (us for him and <br/>\nhim for us). <br/>\nMany children in foster care (including my oldest two) have Reactive <br/>\nAttachment Disorder. If you&#39;re going to foster, you should get <br/>\nyourself familiar with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway....good for you for wanting to do this.
