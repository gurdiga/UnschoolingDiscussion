We rented<br/>\nuntil 3 months ago when we moved onto our 16 acres.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know quite a few people who have moved fron city to country and many are very<br/>\nhappy. The ones who aren&#39;t are usually the ones who moved for the sake of the<br/>\nchildren. Who moved because they thought it would be a good place to bring up<br/>\ntheir kids. Obviously you wouldn&#39;t do it because you thought it was bad for your<br/>\nkids &lt;g&gt; but IMO the kids shouldn&#39;t be your primary reason for moving. If they<br/>\nare older, like mine, they will need an adjustment time, in fact may never<br/>\nadjust, and they will feel especially resentful if they are aware or reminded<br/>\nthat you moved for their benefit. Even if they are babies when you move they may<br/>\nnot be the sort of kids who will relish country life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess what I am saying is, *you* and your partner must really want to live<br/>\nin the country for your *own* sakes. The &#39;great for the kids bit&#39; may or may not<br/>\nbe an added bonus.

We pointed out that for us it was now or never due<br/>\nto our age (48 /49) and they were accepting of that.
