I&#39;m the mother of Emily 4 and Ethan 1.5. We have recently decided to<br/>\nunschool. I feel terrific about this decision but my husband is still<br/>\nskeptical. I am the recently retired (at 28) pre-school teacher from a<br/>\nparent cooperative school. The more &quot;educated&quot; I have become the more I<br/>\nfeel confident about our decision. My daughter was the child who went to<br/>\nMothers day out and pre-school. As you well know we have spent the last<br/>\nsix months unschooling her (even though she only went for a short period<br/>\nof time) and rebuilding our relationship. As a revelation to me and my<br/>\nhusband, we had a lot of issues to resolve and lots of bonding to do. My<br/>\ndaughter and I had to re-establish our relationship completely . It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen hard but its been beautiful. We have finally reached a point where<br/>\nwe are all comfortable and working together. I never realized how out of<br/>\nsync my family was. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe love the library, park, museums, going for walks, visiting with<br/>\nfriends, having an open schedule, gardening, baking, sewing, making<br/>\nthings, painting, reading, music, dancing, gym time, camping, hiking,<br/>\ncanoeing, and we are discovering new things all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is the dramatic one and my son is the &quot;strong&quot; one. Both are<br/>\nvery passionate and compassionate. We are having a blast although we are<br/>\ntrying to est. ourselves in a local group right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, Brad, is a youth minister so we are always into kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the time and hope to have more great conversations.<br/>\nIn the spirit<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
