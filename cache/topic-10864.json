No tv, no radio on, no telephone ringing, a quiet <br/>\nstreet/neighborhood, and maybe 1 neighbor child to play with, occassionally.  <br/>\nHe is Soooooooo sensative.  He needs to be alone, IMHO, because he was <br/>\nalready with us and that was too much apparently.  I hate to imagine what <br/>\nwould happen if I was going to send him to school.

He actually does better on <br/>\ndays where my dh is not home-- sounds awful,  I know.  The thing is, he needs <br/>\nthe comfort of our routine, and when dh is home, the routine  is thrown off.  <br/>\nThen my son gets easily overstimulated, and fatigued.   He is best in his own <br/>\nsurroundings with little interruption at this time in his life.  He loves to <br/>\nbe *in control*, because he finds security in that.  He enjoys having 1-3 <br/>\nfriends over, but again, wants to be &quot;in charge&quot; of what&#39;s going on! ~Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10850,"nextTopicId":10866}}
