And <br/>\nI have supported every change. He is still figuring out what he <br/>\nloves. And each time he gets a piece of it, he is so much happier <br/>\nin life. In the meantime, he works as a professor and has <br/>\nanother job that acts as our financial base. But that doesn&#39;t stop <br/>\nhim for starting a business or dreaming. And I&#39;m excited to see <br/>\nhow much clarity starts to come when you stop thinking in terms <br/>\nof what I &quot;can&quot; do to what I &quot;want&quot; to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yos wants to work with animals. They are his consuming <br/>\npassion. I checked out a book about careers in wildlife and it <br/>\nwas fabulous. The best part came at the end. The writer said <br/>\nsomething to this effect: If you want to work with animals, start <br/>\ntoday. Spend some time with animals and find a niche. If you&#39;re <br/>\nan accountant, then be an accountant for a zoo or nature center. <br/>\nIf your experience is hiring and firing people, work in HR for a <br/>\nzoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo animal rescue as your avocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nVolunteer to do education for  endangered species.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point was that every job a person can do would be more <br/>\nhappily done if that person were around animals (this is for the <br/>\nanimal lover).<br/>\n<br/>\nI got to thinking about that and thought it was a good principle for <br/>\nanyone looking at work/career. find a way to take what you are <br/>\ngood at and use it in the field of your interest. That will take you <br/>\none step closer to being congruent with what you spend most of <br/>\nyour time doing and what you spend your time fantasizing about.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: more on college","postDate":"1043938361","msgId":57148,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTMwMTQ1MjQxLjUwNjY4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBNUU4MjFDLjEzMjUzJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":57147,"nextInTopic":57150,"prevInTime":57147,"nextInTime":57149,"topicId":56910,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Demaine, at 20, arrived <br/>\nin the fall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the <br/>\nrank of assistant professor - one of the youngest the university has <br/>\never hired.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the thing that is truly unusual about Demaine is the story of the <br/>\npath he took to get there - and of his father, Martin Demaine, who <br/>\nhas devoted much of his adult life to educating Erik in a decidedly <br/>\nunorthodox way. Raised among hippies and jugglers and free thinkers, <br/>\nErik Demaine has found himself at the center of a field where <br/>\nabstract math somehow intersects with street performance. That he is <br/>\na prodigy is not even a question, say people who have worked with <br/>\nhim; the question is what will amuse him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;I think the sky is the limit,&#39;&#39; said Anna Lubiw, a professor at the<br/>\nUniversity of Waterloo in Ontario who has coauthored papers with Erik <br/>\nsince he was 15 years old. &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t know anybody else like him, <br/>\nnever mind young. To try to assume anything on the basis of what <br/>\nother people have done is nonsense.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, it would be hard to pick out Erik and Martin Demaine at <br/>\nMIT&#39;s computer science department, where they both took offices last <br/>\nSeptember - Erik on the second floor as an assistant professor, his <br/>\nfather on the third as an unpaid visiting scholar, which Erik said <br/>\nwas an incentive, although not a condition, of his choice to come <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut eight years ago, when the father and son walked into the computer<br/>\nscience department of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, <br/>\nthey seemed to have emerged from nowhere. &#39;&#39;His dad and he walked <br/>\ninto our department and just said he wants to join the university,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nsaid Sampalli Srinivas, an associate professor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdministrators looked at them like they were crazy. Erik was 12 years <br/>\nold, he had no board scores, and no high school diploma. But they <br/>\nallowed Erik to take advanced courses in abstract algebra and <br/>\nprogramming languages. The result was clear by the end of the <br/>\nterm: &#39;&#39;He aced every single course,&#39;&#39; Srinivas said. &#39;&#39;I recognized <br/>\nhim as one of the brightest students I had.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the next few years, a growing number of Canadian academics heard <br/>\nthe story of Erik&#39;s migratory education. It was a project that kept <br/>\nfather and son on the road for five years, eating $1 meals in rented <br/>\nrooms, and strolling into prestigious universities to talk to <br/>\nprofessors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it rested on a risky assumption about the academic world: That If <br/>\nyou called up a professor and said your son had some questions about <br/>\nhis work, that professor would invite you in, and start teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;People always seemed curious to meet us,&#39;&#39; said Martin Demaine, <br/>\n58. &#39;&#39;Then I would tell his age. I think there certainly was some <br/>\nmystery about us that we allowed to exist.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first years of Erik&#39;s life, the Demaines lived more or less <br/>\nby the rules in Halifax, with Martin working long hours as a <br/>\nsilversmith and Erik enrolled in Montessori school, Martin said. But <br/>\nafter a painful divorce - neither father nor son was willing to talk <br/>\nabout it on the record - Martin came to the realization, as he puts <br/>\nit, that &#39;&#39;I didn&#39;t know how to bring up a child.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Martin threw himself into it the way he had thrown himself into<br/>\nglassblowing, silversmithing, puzzlemaking, and filmmaking, among <br/>\nvariousother pursuits. He fired the nanny and came up with a plan: <br/>\nThey would live on $5,000 a year. They would travel by bus, support <br/>\nthemselves with craft shows and the proceeds of the &#39;&#39;Erik & Dad <br/>\nPuzzle Co.,&#39;&#39; and attempt to feed themselves on a budget of $1 per <br/>\nmeal per person (a goal Martin admits sheepishly now they did not <br/>\nalways achieve). Martin would work as little as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe father&#39;s educational theory went like this: Apart from one hour <br/>\nof homeschooling a day, the child should pursue his own interests. <br/>\nThey spent a few weeks at a commune in Tennessee, a year in <br/>\nProvidence, six months in Chicago. During a three-year stint in Miami <br/>\nBeach, he sat Erik down with a neighbor to see if he was interested <br/>\nin learning Chinese; the language instruction went nowhere, but the <br/>\nneighbor had a computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey borrowed missionary textbooks from a group of Seventh-day <br/>\nAdventists. Martin Demaine can remember three bookstores where the <br/>\nstaff became so accustomed to seeing the Demaines poring through <br/>\ntheir merchandise that they set up tables as a study area for the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;We would go to a museum,&#39;&#39; Demaine said. &#39;&#39;Anything he pointed to or<br/>\nmentioned, I&#39;d go to the library and find a book and leave it on the <br/>\ntable. Sometimes after three days the books would disappear.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result, according to Erik Demaine, is that he pursued his own <br/>\ninterests, circumventing years of cramming for tests and memorizing <br/>\nfacts. &#39;&#39;Memorization is not such a big deal. You remember what you <br/>\nneed to remember and look the rest up,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis father insisted that he try school regularly, &#39;&#39;To make sure,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nErik Demaine said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;In Miami Beach, I went to school for a month because there was this <br/>\ncute girl,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;It was a fine experience, but it was a much, <br/>\nmuch slower pace than I was used to.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nErik understands why people put such an emphasis on studying for <br/>\ntests: &#39;&#39;You need grades so you can do something you want to do <br/>\nafterward. You need to take the tests to get the grades to apply to <br/>\ngraduate school.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut none of that ever applied to him. At 9, Erik took over the<br/>\nhome-schooling teacher&#39;s manual and began teaching himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Dalhousie, and then at the University of Waterloo, the Demaines <br/>\nmade an unusual pair, the gangly teenager and his ponytailed father <br/>\nsitting together in class. &#39;&#39;The thing that really struck me was the <br/>\nway his dad motivated him,&#39;&#39; said Srinivas. &#39;&#39;When Erik was sick and <br/>\nfelt under the weather, his dad used to attend my lecture and make a <br/>\ntape.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Martin Demaine, who had made forays into physics and law graduate<br/>\nprograms but had never finished a college degree, began to hear people<br/>\ndescribe his son as a prodigy. &#39;&#39;To be honest, I just thought he was <br/>\nabove average,&#39;&#39; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey continued to work together, though, as Erik&#39;s interests wandered <br/>\nfrom tectonic plates to liquid dynamics to parallel computing <br/>\nsystems. It was Martin, with his background in the visual arts, who <br/>\nintroduced his son and his professors to the ancient Japanese art of <br/>\nfolding paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong the exclusive terrain of a few researchers, origami math has <br/>\nwoken up slowly in recent years as researchers began to apply it to a <br/>\nlengthening list of real-world applications: to the folding of <br/>\nproteins in human DNA, or the unfolding of enormous lenses in <br/>\norbiting space telescopes, or the folding of air bags in automobiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nErik also became interested in the study of linkage, the dynamics of<br/>\nrigid-sided polygons in two dimensions. Last year, with the help of<br/>\nmathematicians Robert Connelly and Gunther Rote, he solved the <br/>\ninfamous &#39;&#39;Carpenter&#39;s Ruler&#39;&#39; problem, which had stymied scientists <br/>\nsince the 1960s, proving that any such polygon can be unraveled <br/>\nwithout breaking - work that would be relevant to the fields of <br/>\nrobotics and genetics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy last year, when he interviewed at Stanford, New York University, <br/>\nand Carnegie Mellon, Erik was a coveted hire. Leigh Deacon, from her <br/>\ndesk in MIT&#39;s computer science department, watched the hiring process <br/>\nwith fascination. &#39;&#39;I said, unless this man has a third eye, <br/>\neverybody&#39;s going to want him,&#39;&#39; Deacon said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe news that he had accepted and that she would be working as his<br/>\nadministrative assistant made her more than a little anxious. She had<br/>\nalready spent too much time around geniuses, enough to know <br/>\nthat &#39;&#39;almost none of them know how to behave with other humans.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;I thought to myself, what am I going to get? The most arrogant,<br/>\negotistical person on the planet? Am I going to get someone just <br/>\nshort of insane? There&#39;s got to be something wrong with him to <br/>\ncompensate for his brilliance,&#39;&#39; said Deacon. &#39;&#39;I was just <br/>\nshocked ... He has this sort of quiet humility. He&#39;s got this nice <br/>\nexpression on his face.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was the strange business of his father accompanying him. <br/>\nIt&#39;s an unusual arrangement, agreed one colleague, but it&#39;s worked so <br/>\nfar.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;Anyone who takes the time to know what Erik is about would know that<br/>\nseparating him from his father would be a bad idea,&#39;&#39; said Thomas <br/>\nHull, an assistant professor at Merrimack College who has conducted <br/>\nresearch with the Demaines on origami.<br/>\n<br/>\nLubiw, who was one of Erik&#39;s thesis advisers, said there is no <br/>\nquestion that the Demaines&#39; work is a function of synergy. &#39;&#39;Even me, <br/>\nI can&#39;t tell what is his gift, what is his obsession, and what is his <br/>\nhard work,&#39;&#39; said Lubiw. &#39;&#39;I do take moral lessons for the way Marty <br/>\nraised him.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20, Erik is nearly out of prodigy age range, and his lanky 6-foot-<br/>\n3-inch frame makes his age barely detectable anyway. He will explain, <br/>\nwith a sweet smile, that our society is far too age- segregated: &#39;&#39;It <br/>\nis my single passive political stance,&#39;&#39; he said - and argues that a <br/>\nlot of other people could do what he does if they had the same <br/>\nencouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Waterloo department that was home to this strange duo until <br/>\nlast fall, there is a twinge of regret at their departure. But Ian <br/>\nMunro, Erik&#39;s thesis adviser, said he is just glad they came in the <br/>\nfirst place.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;&#39;You don&#39;t regret things like that happening to you,&#39;&#39; said <br/>\nMunro. &#39;&#39;You think: It was great to have Erik as a student.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis story ran on page A1 of the Boston Globe on 2/17/2002.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma<br/>\n&quot;Experts and an expert culture always call for more experts.

I think about my own passion of <br/>\nphotography, which is what I chose to get my degree in, and how I <br/>\ncould&#39;ve been better served by not going to college. If you think of <br/>\nall the money I spent on college, and how little photography <br/>\nexperience I got out of it (because most of that money got spent on <br/>\nall the other pre-req classse I had to take), I&#39;m sure I could&#39;ve <br/>\ntaken that same money, got myself a nice Hasselblad medium-format <br/>\ncamera, apprenticed myself to a really good photographer, traveled <br/>\naround the world, and in 4 years I would&#39;ve not only been a much <br/>\nbetter photographer, I would&#39;ve made all sorts of connections in the <br/>\nworld of photography, and would&#39;ve understood how to make a living at <br/>\nit. As it was, when I graduated, I realized that I didn&#39;t have the <br/>\nportfolio or experience to get a job in photography, but had all <br/>\nthese college loans to pay off, so I ended up using my minor in <br/>\nComputer Science to go work at Microsoft. I&#39;m not unhappy with how <br/>\neverything played out, and I really loved college and the whole <br/>\nexperience. I was exposed to all sorts of people and experiences that <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t have been otherwise. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that <br/>\nfor any given field there might be much more cost-effective (and <br/>\nbetter!) ways to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who used to hire in the computer field, I&#39;d say that the <br/>\ncollege degree on the resume was what got somebody through HR and to <br/>\nmy desk for an interview, but people came there via other paths as <br/>\nwell - By knowing someone in the group, or having done something <br/>\nimpressive on computers on their own and gotten the attention of <br/>\nsomeone. Once they were interviewing with me, I could care less <br/>\nwhether they had a degree at all. What was important was what they <br/>\nknew, and there were plenty of people I interviewed with CS degrees <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t know anything at all! And people without who knew plenty. <br/>\nSo, if a person doesn&#39;t have the degree, they might have to commit a <br/>\nlittle more time to figuring out how to get in the door in a job like <br/>\nthat, but doing an internship or apprenticeship can help.
