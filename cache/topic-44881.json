You are choosing to stay or not stay a certain way. Dogs in <br/>\nthe wild and domestic dogs way back then didn&#39;t live nearly as long as they <br/>\ndo now. In a way, they count on us to take care of them to prolong their <br/>\nlives and give them quality. Those aren&#39;t decisions they can make <br/>\nthemselves. They will drink anti freeze and eat poison with no regard to <br/>\nwhat it will do. They will run out in to the street. That&#39;s where <br/>\nresponsible ownership should come in. For us as people to make good <br/>\ndecisions on their behalf. Dogs don&#39;t live as long in general as people and <br/>\naren&#39;t as large either, that&#39;s why just 5 lbs can make a difference in their <br/>\nquality and quantity of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] dog food","postDate":"1033420729","msgId":44883,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODEwMWMyNjhjNiRmODRiNjg2MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEI5QkU4MjAzLjEzOTMlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":44881,"nextInTopic":44892,"prevInTime":44882,"nextInTime":44884,"topicId":44881,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"But I d be really peeved if my husband insisted I eat occasional treats ...
