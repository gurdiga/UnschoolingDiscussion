Even my 16 and 12 y.o.&#39;s don&#39;t remember to bring their dishes out<br/>\nof their room every day. They eventually get them to the sink, or I&#39;ll<br/>\nremind them if I notice and grab a couple on my way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra loves to help set the table and stuff like that. Jalen(almost5)<br/>\nhates anything that even resembles a &quot;chore&quot;, but if it&#39;s fun, heck<br/>\nyeah. He&#39;ll  use the swiffer or small vacuum cleaner like a maniac.<br/>\nHe&#39;ll even help me fold laundry if he comes in while I&#39;m doing<br/>\nit...but dishes and pick up are not his  thing right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cool parts about not making a big issue out of household tasks, is<br/>\neveryone is much more pleasant when they do help. I helped Sierra<br/>\nrearrange her room today and the boys apparently got inspired. I guess<br/>\nit was Trevor&#39;s idea (he and Jared share a room temporarily) and they<br/>\nboth cleaned it up, vacuumed etc... It looked great and no one said a<br/>\nthing about it...they just decided they wanted a clean room. Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ways each person helps are very different, the commonality is it<br/>\ncomes from a desire within them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111327,"nextTopicId":111416}}
