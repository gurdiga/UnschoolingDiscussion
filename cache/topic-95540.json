I hated them, always.  I did them because I was there (often <br/>\nwith a friend -- I wanted to see the friend, not do the stupid <br/>\ncraft) and there wasn&#39;t anything else to do.  I did them sloppily <br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t care, BUT then I felt bad that mine weren&#39;t as neat <br/>\nand pretty as some of the other kids&#39;.  Double whammy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day Fisher (almost 7) wanted to get out the finger paints. <br/>\nHis preschool did a lot of fingerpainting.  But I think this was the <br/>\nfirst time he had real fun doing it.  We built up slowly, then ended <br/>\nup gooshing together all the colors and covering the whole paper, <br/>\nand he was laughing his head off.  We discovered a lot of things <br/>\nabout color and feel and texture -- we ended up creating the actual <br/>\npictures by scraping them into the backdrop of paint, instead of <br/>\ndrawing them with the paint itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no one said he was too old or that he needed to do a certain <br/>\ntechnique or that art time was over.  We did it until we were done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"&quot;Danielle Conger&quot; &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooled children vs. Curriculum Children","postDate":"1086785323","msgId":95540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYzMwMWM0NGUyMCQxOWI2M2NiMCQ2NDAxYThjMEBNT0xFMjY5MDA+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95618,"prevInTime":95539,"nextInTime":95541,"topicId":95540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Robyn wrote: They talk about how they did The Food Pyramid (as if there were only one) ...

These are mini-lessons with<br/>\nseveral different activities like Robyn describes, complete with cheezy<br/>\ncrafts and circle songs, that are supposed to be for kids 5-7 years old.<br/>\nThese activities seem so incredibly lame to me--something far more geared<br/>\ntowards preschool 2 and 3 year olds. I can&#39;t imagine trying to get the<br/>\nunschooled kids I know to sit down and do these things, nor would I try. My<br/>\nidea of developmentally ready learning is that kids will take what they find<br/>\ninteresting from life, without an artificial separation of age-specific<br/>\ntopics, and run with it, leaving what&#39;s not interesting or too advanced<br/>\nbehind to maybe come back to later.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily (6) *loves* PBS historical documentaries. I can&#39;t imagine saying to<br/>\nher, &quot;Oh, honey, you don&#39;t want to watch this boring, advanced documentary<br/>\non Abraham Lincoln. Why don&#39;t you sit in the corner and learn about doggies<br/>\nand make some doggie ears out of these styrofoam cups.&quot; These contrived<br/>\nactivities are turning the kind of learning, creating and imagining that<br/>\nyoung kids do spontaneously all throughout their day into a curriculum.<br/>\nCurriculum has to build this kind of learning into kids&#39; days precisely<br/>\nbecause the act of controlling children and their time strips kids of the<br/>\nopportunity to do the same learning on their own in a far more meaningful<br/>\nway. I realize I&#39;m probably stating the obvious, but it&#39;s been brought home<br/>\nto me again as I bumped, unwillingly, into the curriculum world. It&#39;s just<br/>\namazing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95542,"nextTopicId":95620}}
