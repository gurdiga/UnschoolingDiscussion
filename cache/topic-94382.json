I wanted to let you know about a magazine that we have supported for years. It is called Young Voices. It is a non profit venture, run by a local (Olympia, WA) fellow named Steve Charak. He runs writers workshops for kids of all ages and has been publishing our DD&#39;s stories since she was 7. They do pay $5 for each piece they publish - not much, but as Steve says, &quot;you can truthfully say you are a paid writer&quot;. For 14 years he has been publishing written material and cartoons and drawings and photographs from kids all over the country. It comes out 4 times a year. This summer our DD will get to be on the editorial board for the 1st time. Here is the link.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youngvoicesmagazine.com/&lt;http://www.youngvoicesmagazine.com/\">http://www.youngvoicesmagazine.com/&lt;http://www.youngvoicesmagazine.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently got a letter from Steve saying that they need to raise some money to keep publishing or go to an online format. Times are tough for everyone. It has always been exciting and satisfying for our child to see her stories, drawings and photos in print. It is also great perspective to see what other kids her age are writing. At this point she too is searching for new places to submit her work. She worries that the audience in Young Voices may be too young for her recent forays into darker poetry.<br/>\n<br/>\nCicada Magazine also accepts submissions from young people. DD hasn&#39;t tried that one yet, although she reads it thoroughly. Their length limits are pretty tight. Our soft-spoken daughter who rarely talks aloud is pretty verbose on paper &lt;G&gt;.

I sometimes get antsy and make it worse. When I can just let our daughter be, she eventually comes up for air and activities. As a story sponge, TV viewing is actually extremely useful for her. Just a few days ago she had a light bulb over her head. She explained to me that the background story arc in Buffy the Vampire Slayer is actually based on Greek Mythology and Hercules. She had watched something on the History Channel the previous night that dealt with ancient Greek stories and how they changed as they were sung and told for hundreds of years. I got goose bumps seeing her integrate such disparate things as Buffy, Disney&#39;s Hercules, Greek history, and her own dreams of the night.<br/>\n Oo, this got long - sorry.<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\nSheri<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94319,"nextTopicId":94215}}
