I ask his opinion about everything, even when I know there will be no opinion coming.  (But if I word it as a yes or no question, like &quot;shall we go to the market?&quot;, I can almost always get a response, and it&#39;s fortuantely usually a yes.)  I also listen carefully if he&#39;s strongly opposed to anything -- for instance, we stopped at a small demonstration farm because he very much enjoys animals.  There was a rooster crowing, so he didn&#39;t want to enter the barnyard (he is bothered by loud noises).  So we didn&#39;t go in -- we walked along the fence and pointed out the horses and cows and llamas instead.  From that distance he could quite enjoy the animals -- if I had forced the issue and made him go inside, maybe he would have had fun, but I didn&#39;t think it was worth risking his trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Shelley, does Jacob, himself, feel frustrated with any of his challenges?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes he does, particularly when his mind is so far ahead of his physical capabilities that he can&#39;t complete tasks he wants to.  For instance, he went thru a phase when he was around a year old where he wanted to stack blocks 5 to 8 blocks high.  His physical coordination wasn&#39;t such that he could do that without kocking them down before he reached the height he wanted to, and we had many tears and frustration.  DH wanted to put the blocks away to prevent him from getting so frustrated, but I decided that helping him be successful would be a better approach, so I showed him how to build the blocks against a wall -- that way they only could fall over in a couple directions instead of all around, and he was successful at least part of the time.  Within a few months, his dexterity caught up to his stacking desires and he was able to stack blocks wherever he wanted.  He worked on block stacking for hours on end every day to get to that point, it was amazing to watch!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the way he takes on challenges like that -- if he decides he wants to do something he practices until it&#39;s perfect.  A lot of frustration is often involved in the process, but his determination is absolutely awe inspiring.  We spent a couple of hours at the playground the other day learning to climb a ladder.  He saw another kid about his size do it, and decided he had to &quot;own&quot; that activity as well.  At first I had to hold him while he practiced moving his legs up the rungs (something we&#39;ve been doing for a long time).  Then he started holding on with his hands and &quot;climbing&quot; with them too (with me still holding on).  He finally got coordinated enough to really climb the ladder on his own, but we had a whole bunch of steps in weaning him off of needing my help -- first I had to hold him the whole way, then just a hand on his butt, then just a hand for the last couple rungs, then just standing nearby.  By the end of those 2 hours, parents who had come to the playground after he mastered his new climbing skill commented on how good he was at that for his age!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I&#39;m rambling, but get me going on my favorite topic....&lt;G&gt;.

This has become more evident as he&#39;s gotten older (he&#39;s only 2 1/2 now).  Tho I knew there were differences, I hadn&#39;t considered that there as anything &quot;wrong&quot; with him until a friend suggested I read a Screeening for Austistic Symptoms in Toddlers (she suspected he may fall on the spectrum somewhere).  I thought, no, that can&#39;t be, but read through the screening anyway, and found I was answering &quot;yes&quot; to far more questions than I was answering &quot;no&quot; to.  So I read and read and read, and discussed with my husband, and we&#39;ve come to the conclussion that he does in deed seem to fit into this &quot;category&quot; of individuals.

We are going to start a gluten free/casein free diet with him (and us!), and let him continue to learn and develop at HIS pace.  I don&#39;t feel that his development has stalled, it just seems to be a little slower than most kids -- I&#39;ve never seen any huge change in his personality or behavior.  He&#39;s the same child I gave birth too -- just a little different than the average Joe, that&#39;s all.  I think his brain is so full of other things that the developmental stuff just needs time for it to make room for it.  I see him hitting his milestones, just not on the same time table as every other kid.  Yesterday he used his first pro-noun, and spoke his first complicated sentence, and the first thing that I would consider to be &quot;conversational&quot;.  (We were joking around, he was calling me Daddy to be silly, I was calling him Linus, his cat&#39;s name.  He was laughing and laughing and then said &quot;No Linus.  My name is Jacob.&quot;)  That confirmed to us that he&#39;ll get where he needs to be, he&#39;s just going to do it on &quot;Jacob time&quot;.  And I don&#39;t feel that I have the right to interfere -- I trust that his brain knows what it&#39;s doing, and I don&#39;t want to stand in the way of it figuring things out in the manner that is best for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks so much for responding, Anne.

As <br/>\nunschoolers, we&#39;re learning how to listen to our own hearts, and see <br/>\nwhat is right for our children and for our families, and tuning out <br/>\nthose background noises in our minds that are from all of the <br/>\n*experts.* <br/>\n<br/>\nShelley ~ my only concern with getting a diagnosis is not how other <br/>\npeople will feel about your Jacob, but how he will feel about <br/>\nhimself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own child was always unique and non-traditional, but because he <br/>\nwas always celebrated and honored for being exactly Who He Is, he had <br/>\nno labels attached to his heart.  He&#39;s always been comfortable with <br/>\nbeing unique, and never had any thought that there may be something <br/>\nwrong with him that needed to be fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I guess the answer lies within how far on the spectrum your son <br/>\nis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are his *traits* that are of concern to you, Shelley?  Sometimes <br/>\nif you just learn about ways you can help your child yourself, then <br/>\nthat is sufficient.  I found a lot of good information in the <br/>\nbook &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; and &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child.&quot;  It&#39;s <br/>\nbecause of the latter book that I no longer feel my child is on the <br/>\nautistic spectrum.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I am also looking for information on unschooling children with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>developmental disorders.  Seems to me this would be a natural thing <br/>\nto do with a &quot;unique&quot; child like this, but need some reassurance that <br/>\nI&#39;m making the proper decision in this matter.  I was/am firmly <br/>\ncommited to unschooling our kids until this came up, and just want to <br/>\nmake sure I don&#39;t need to think about altering those plans.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, Shelley, my Jake has always been unschooled (he&#39;s almost <br/>\n13), and it is the best label-free life for any unique child.  They <br/>\nare free to be Who They Are, without anyone telling them they have to <br/>\nbe like all the other kids.  They can follow their hearts and their <br/>\npassions without control or intervention or direction from others <br/>\ntelling them not to listen to their hearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an article that Sandra kindly has on her website (it&#39;s <br/>\nentitled &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/special/anne\">http://sandradodd.com/special/anne</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll be talking about this at the South Carolina conference?  Are <br/>\nyou coming??  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I am extremely leary about affixing a &quot;label&quot; to Jacob that he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>will be stuck with the rest of his life -- he is an amazing and <br/>\nunique individual, and the thought of lumping him under some sort of <br/>\ndiagnosis/classification is disturbing to me.  But of course I want <br/>\nto do the &quot;right&quot; thing by him, regardless of how uncomfortable it <br/>\nmakes ME.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what that &quot;right&quot; thing <br/>\nis.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re listening to your heart, Shelley.  Thank you.  Thank you for <br/>\nseeing your child as the amazing and unique person that he is.  He <br/>\nneeds you to do that for him for his entire life, because there will <br/>\nbe enough people out there giving him the message that he&#39;s less than <br/>\nWhole.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in adding to that message with a diagnosis <br/>\n(again, unless he is absolutely in need of some intervention, but, <br/>\nagain, that may be obtained just by reading about Sensory Integration <br/>\nDysfunction, as all children on the autism spectrum has Sensory <br/>\nIntegration Dysfunction...and you could even get an occupational <br/>\ntherapist for his sensory integration dysfunction challenges if <br/>\nabsolutely necessary...).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour heart is telling you to continue to Honor your child for Who He <br/>\nIs.  I think it&#39;s the right step for today.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to talk more about what specific concerns you have <br/>\nabout Jacob&#39;s traits, I&#39;d be happy to respond more.

I&#39;m in the information-gathering stage of researching all this, and  have a couple questions that I&#39;m sure some of you dyed-in-the-wool unschoolers will have answers for.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I am trying to decide whether or not to pursue an assessment and diagnosis for Jacob.  Seems to me the only reason to do this at this point would be to get him into an Early Intervention program.  Now, I&#39;m having trouble finding out exactly what is involved in &quot;Early Intervention&quot; -- most of the information I have just says it&#39;s &quot;very important&quot; (whatever that means) to a child&#39;s future to get diagnosed and started on &quot;Intervention&quot; as early as possible, but nothing seems to go into any detail about what it entails. I was wondering if anybody knows.  Seems to me &quot;Early Intervention&quot; is probably not a very unschooling thing to do??  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern (and this might not be something anyone here can answer) is that, if I DO pursue a diagnosis, am I legally bound in some way to then enroll him in Early Intervention?  Or any other form of &quot;treatment&quot;?   I have enough references on the topic of autism to keep me reading for the next 18 years of his life &lt;G&gt;, but haven&#39;t come across this sort of information yet.  I just want to know what I&#39;m getting us into should I decide to go down that path<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also looking for information on unschooling children with developmental disorders.  Seems to me this would be a natural thing to do with a &quot;unique&quot; child like this, but need some reassurance that I&#39;m making the proper decision in this matter.  I was/am firmly commited to unschooling our kids until this came up, and just want to make sure I don&#39;t need to think about altering those plans.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am extremely leary about affixing a &quot;label&quot; to Jacob that he will be stuck with the rest of his life -- he is an amazing and unique individual, and the thought of lumping him under some sort of diagnosis/classification is disturbing to me.  But of course I want to do the &quot;right&quot; thing by him, regardless of how uncomfortable it makes ME.
