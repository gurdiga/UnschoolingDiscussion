I can remember my grandma being so <br/>\nexcited when I was 5 years old and tested into the &quot;gifted&quot; program at <br/>\nschool.  She told EVERYONE.  I actually think in many ways, she felt it was <br/>\nmore her achievement than mine.  I, like you, am a regular Jane today!  So <br/>\nmuch for labels.  In fact, I as a 5 year old, I tested average in language <br/>\narts and &quot;gifted&quot; in math and sciences.  However, by the time I graduated HS, <br/>\nI was in honors Spanish IV, honors German III, honors English, and honors <br/>\nWorld History.  However, I barely scraped though Geometry and Chem. I - I <br/>\nhated math and science classes!  Go figure!<br/>\n    I do have to recall one fond memory though.  Throughout, elementary <br/>\nschool, I had a dear woman named Mrs. Melton for my &quot;gifted and talented&quot; <br/>\nclass (as they called it back then!).  I know this woman was an unschooler at <br/>\nheart!  For two glorious hours everyday, I had the privilege of being in her <br/>\nclassroom and I don&#39;t think I ever had an &quot;assignment.&quot;  There were many <br/>\nlearning opportunities -- animals (fish, birds, turtles, hamsters, mice, <br/>\nrats), puzzles, books, logic games, art supplies, etc., and we were <br/>\nencouraged to use any of them we wanted.  At any given time, you could look <br/>\naround our classroom and see close to a dozen different projects in progress <br/>\n-- everyone working on their own interests.  And she was much more a <br/>\nfacilitator than a teacher.  I do not recall here ever standing before the <br/>\nclass teaching.  She would walk around from project to project, observing and <br/>\nencouraging.  Even when we asked her questions, she seemed to never really <br/>\nanswer them for us.  Instead, she would gather other students around and ask <br/>\nquestions such as, &quot;What might be another way we could get such-and-such <br/>\nresult . . .&quot;  She was a truly wonderful educator, and most likely the <br/>\nsalvation of my ps education.  What sweet memories I have of her!<br/>\n<br/>\nCandice in OK (ok -- maybe I don&#39;t need an intro!

I wonder if people thought she was nuts?  My mother told me <br/>\n(repeatedly!) about little boys and girls who got Polio from vaccination <br/>\nshots,<br/>\n and how lucky I was that she didn&#39;t take that chance with me.

When I got married I got a rubella shot, per <br/>\n doctor&#39;s orders to &quot;protect my unborn children.&quot; When I had my children, <br/>\nthey <br/>\n were both immunized along the usual &quot;schedule&quot; per my pediatrician. Funny <br/>\n thing, though. I remembered my mother&#39;s stories about polio and insisted <br/>\nthat <br/>\n my children only get the &quot;inactive&quot; polio virus - despite the pediatrician <br/>\n insisting that it isn&#39;t as &quot;effective.&quot; I had to explain that I had never <br/>\n been immunized as a child and therefor ran the risk of getting polio from my <br/>\n now-vaccinated child if they gave him/her the &quot;active&quot; virus.<br/>\n    <br/>\n  Re: Handwriting<br/>\n  My grandmother had the most beautiful, delicate handwriting I have ever <br/>\nseen.<br/>\n  She wrote so slowly and carefully - it was almost art.

My &quot;handwriting&quot; is printing <br/>\n and it&#39;s damn nice, too. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  I print because it&#39;s faster, easier, better-looking and no one gives a <br/>\nrat&#39;s-<br/>\n butt if I use cursive.
