I was alwasys very worried about daddy<br/>\ngetting hurt on the job but my parents handled it in a way that I really<br/>\ndidn&#39;t worry about it till later in life. The main thing I remember us<br/>\ndoing is that we made a big deal of him weaaring his bullet-proof vest,<br/>\nhe would start getting ready for work and would have me bring it to him<br/>\nand help him make sure it was on correctly. I know that helped me.<br/>\nIronicly enough my dad was injured on the job (a security jobafter he had<br/>\nquit the force), not by a shooting but by a reckless driver, it was a<br/>\ntough fight but he did make it with a minium of problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to lurk mode :)<br/>\nBeth<br/>\nWAHM to the twin terrors, T.J.(8) and &quot;DrewBug&quot; (6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 22:41:56 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;    From: Corallyn Berger &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hape2day@...\">hape2day@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Son&#39;s praying for daddy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you<br/>\n&gt; can relate to it but maybe someone has a suggestion as<br/>\n&gt; to how to handle this situation. My DH is a police<br/>\n&gt; officer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>\n&gt; does. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>\n&gt; hard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>\n&gt; his uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>\n&gt; work. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>\n&gt; bedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>\n&gt; daddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>\n&gt; prayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>\n&gt; difficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>\n&gt; that was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>\n&gt; bedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>\n&gt; get shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>\n&gt; thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>\n&gt; long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>\n&gt; the case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>\n&gt; night I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>\n&gt; because I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>\n&gt; possible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>\n&gt; Then DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>\n&gt; I asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>\n&gt; it and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>\n&gt; fine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; make an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>\n&gt; said anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>\n&gt; then it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>\n&gt; I feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>\n&gt; then give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>\n&gt; must do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>\n&gt; daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________<br/>\nYOU&#39;RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!<br/>\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!<br/>\nTry it today - there&#39;s no risk!
