I happen to<br/>\nknow that the basic college algebra class starts pretty basic - a child<br/>\nwith no formal algebra but a good grasp of basic math would do fine. <br/>\nThere is also a class for those who don&#39;t have enough math to take the<br/>\nalgebra class.  I forget what it is called - something like preperatory<br/>\nmath or somesuch.<br/>\nSo I would say, look into the colleges (by asking other students there -<br/>\nnot the faculty) and see just what will be needed.  You may find that he<br/>\nneeds a lot less than you think in the way of formal math - in fact &quot;none<br/>\nat all&quot; comes to mind here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget  <br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>\n          Tyranny of the majority is tyranny nonetheless.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Pgubniyvf5ggeZRuXpFOWprGOcd5q9p_xxJh89l3vDaUEKUqqKK7GfUD379Wb9_xvbf42GI0k9P7AcMkzn_AOQwwWsTJHxQT","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1521","postDate":"1002197785","msgId":26663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWMxNGNjZSQ2M2FmNmVhMCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDIxOTQ4MjguNjA0LjU2MjE4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26664,"prevInTime":26662,"nextInTime":26664,"topicId":26663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... our ...
