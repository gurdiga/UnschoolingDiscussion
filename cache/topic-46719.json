Having the <br/>\nsame procedure is a bit like Pavlov&#39;s dogs so the body produces <br/>\nchemicals in anticipation of the drug. As the week goes on it <br/>\nbecomes more efffcienct so more drug is needed to get the same <br/>\neffects. Group C did not develop a Pavlov response as they never <br/>\nknew when the drug would be adminsitered.<br/>\nIt was the procedure that led to the habituation, like a classical <br/>\nconditioning response, not the drug itself.<br/>\nCancer patients (and drug users) tended to go through the same <br/>\nprocedure daily. ie. Nurse would wheel in cart at 10am, injections <br/>\nprepared and then adminsitered.<br/>\nAfter that study many hospitals varied their drug routine and found <br/>\nless habituation and addiction to the mophine.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is so cool.  A friend of mine said she talked to a woman who used to<br/>\ntake tylenol everyday for a headache, she decided that the headache was<br/>\nin response to the daily routine of taking the tylenol and stopped. <br/>\nEvidently the headaches stopped within a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think the body can create symptoms in response to the medication<br/>\nas well?  Or is this just a case of mind over matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\r<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\r<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
