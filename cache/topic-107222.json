It&#39;s always fun to get to know new unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI quoted what you said above because I think there is often a negative consequence when a lot of homeschoolers in one area use the government homeschooling program.  And that is, as you observed, that independent activities may tend to dry up.  The trend in the U.S seems to be towards tighter supervision in homeschooling programs through local school districts.  I don&#39;t think I could sign up for one without really screwing up my unschooling vision. But there aren&#39;t many people left near me who have the time and inclination to have park days and otherwise socialize.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy, in Benicia, CA</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111066869,"authorName":"Kornelia Mitchell","from":"Kornelia Mitchell &lt;eaglemom@...&gt;","profile":"littleeaglemom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Intro and Looking for Unschoolers in MN","postDate":"1121199177","msgId":107222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDA1MDcxMTEyMDEwMC4wMzQ1OTRiMEBtYWlsLmlzbGFuZC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107237,"prevInTime":107221,"nextInTime":107223,"topicId":107222,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been lurking and learning since last September and never introduced myself or said hello.

I <br/>\nstarted looking into homeschooling options about a year and a half ago and <br/>\nsoon discovered the unschooling message boards on-line. Aquilina and I also <br/>\nstarted meeting up with the other homeschoolers (mostly relaxed and various <br/>\ndegrees of unschoolers) on our island. The more I learned, the more I knew <br/>\nunschooling, especially as practiced by the long time posters on-line, was <br/>\nright for our lifestyle. It just makes so much sense and feels so right!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe practice(d) attachment parenting, extended breastfeeding, and have a <br/>\nfamily bed. We have never had a set bedtime or arbitrary schedule of any <br/>\nsort, but have just followed our own rhythms. Thanks to all the great <br/>\nadvice on-line, I started lifting food restrictions and saying yes as often <br/>\nas possible. I have been allowing Aquilina as much control over her life as <br/>\nI can and have been very pleased with the outcome. Dh still has a way to <br/>\ngo, but he&#39;s coming around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAquilina is a beautiful, creative, smart, funny, and sprited girl with an <br/>\nincredible imagination. I love spending my time with her and sharing our <br/>\npassions as we explore and learn. She loves fantasy, princesses, drawing, <br/>\npainting, body art, make-up and anything fancy, climbing trees, swinging on <br/>\nher swing, playing pretend, watching movies, playing neopets, scooby-doo, <br/>\nmy little pony, barbies, gameboy, flying a kite, animals and nature, and <br/>\nmore pretend. In the last week, she has petted a baby squirrel and seen two <br/>\nbeaver! She has the gift of time... to think... explore... and make <br/>\nconnections. I feel so fortunate and can&#39;t imagine any other lifestyle that <br/>\ncould even compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past &quot;school year&quot; we were officially enrolled with a pilot distance <br/>\neducation program that our school district put together. Their aim was to <br/>\nallow as much flexibility as possible and they want to accommodate <br/>\neveryone, from the school at home folks to unschoolers. The main draw for <br/>\nus was reimbursement for a portion of our educational expenses (gymnastics <br/>\n& swimming lessons) and weekly interaction days. We have an active <br/>\nhomeschool community on our island and we were having weekly get-togethers <br/>\non our own, but these have dropped off since &quot;E-blend&quot; started. I didn&#39;t do <br/>\nanything differently than I would have if we had not enrolled, other than <br/>\nsummarizing some of our activities for 3 meetings with the teacher to aid <br/>\nher in preparing her reports. The report cards we have received from the <br/>\nschool district have been short,anecdotal, and without any testing or <br/>\ngrading. They may be useful in assuaging the fears of relatives (mostly <br/>\nm-i-l) if I need. I do feel a greater sense of security with something to <br/>\nback us up, since we&#39;re following a road less traveled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate all the people who share their advice with us newbies <br/>\non the email lists and message boards. I have learned a tremendous amount <br/>\nand have really gone through some major paradigm shifts in the last year <br/>\nand a half. So thank you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAquilina and I will be travelling to MN in early August so I can attend a <br/>\nconvention for the company I work for (I work at home). Dh won&#39;t be joining <br/>\nus and Aquilina really wants to come, so we&#39;re looking into some childcare <br/>\noptions for while I&#39;m at the conference. I was hoping to come up with a <br/>\nmore creative and fun option than the standard daycare routine, so if there <br/>\nare any unschoolers in Minneapolis who may be open to the idea of paying <br/>\nvisitor(s), please let me know. We might be able to work something out.<br/>\n<br/>\nKornelia<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I would love to see you put together a book of essays, Sandra! I like <br/>\nto read on the computer, but it would be great to have something that would <br/>\nbe easier to share with friends and relatives. I am also a perfectionist <br/>\nprocrastinator, so I can definitely relate to your hesitations. Mark Twain <br/>\nsaid it well; &quot;20 years from now, you will be more disappointed with the <br/>\nthings you didn&#39;t do, rather than the things you did.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.8.11/44 - Release Date: 7/8/05</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107229,"nextTopicId":107257}}
