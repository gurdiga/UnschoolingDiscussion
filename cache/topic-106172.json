I just wanted to speak to the bathroom accidents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has not been diagnosed with any ASDs (autistic spectrum<br/>\ndisorders)or anything else, but he has definitely had problems with<br/>\nbathroom accidents while playing video games.  He has also had them<br/>\nwhile playing other really involved games, usually with other kids. <br/>\nBut yes, he&#39;s had them the most when playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things that have helped the most were time, growth and<br/>\ndevelopment, and unlimited access to video games.  A few months after<br/>\nwe did away with all the limits, and just kept reminding him that it<br/>\nwas okay to pause, because he could play the game for as long as he<br/>\nwanted, whenever he wanted, the accidents were greatly reduced (he was<br/>\n6 and 1/2 at the time).  It took a few months for him to really get<br/>\nit, and for him to trust us.  Now that he&#39;s almost 8, it almost never<br/>\nhappens, and it&#39;s not a huge deal if it does.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the accidents tended to go in<br/>\ncycles.  He wouldn&#39;t have any for a long time, and then he would start<br/>\nhaving them again.  I finally decided that this was part of his growth<br/>\nprocess -- he could hold it for longer as he got older, but as he was<br/>\npracticing holding it longer, he would overreach his limit and have an<br/>\naccident.  Then he would get used to his new &quot;abilities&quot; and things<br/>\nwould normalize for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know (from lists and in real life) of quite a few other kids, some<br/>\nfrom completely unschooled families and some not, who have a tendency<br/>\nto these accidents, some until they were 10 or so.  It seems to be a<br/>\nmix of how their bodies work and of getting so involved with what<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing, they forget to go.  The parents just gently work with<br/>\nthem, assure them that whatever it is will be there when they come<br/>\nback, help them clean up if needed (my son usually washed out his own<br/>\npants and cleaned up after himself -- it helped him feel more<br/>\nindependent), and let them know when they need to change clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nGently and nicely -- a good way to go in most situations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"wifetovegman2002","from":"&quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Autism Spectrum kids and video games (was Re: Introduction and questions)","postDate":"1117164349","msgId":106202,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ3NjN2dCs3ZHZ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106200,"nextInTopic":106208,"prevInTime":106201,"nextInTime":106203,"topicId":106172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had to clean furniture and carpets and floors.  And<br/>\n&gt; not just at home, either.  It&#39;s almost scary.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are your older children also autistic?  It isn&#39;t really fair to<br/>\ncompare children anyway, but comparing a child with a neurological<br/>\ndifference to his older neurologically typical siblings really isn&#39;t<br/>\nfair at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, computer/video games weren&#39;t the same then when they were your<br/>\nson&#39;s age as they are now, either.  It sounds from your word choice<br/>\nmore like you are the one that has decided that video games are evil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our solution is to curtail his video time to about an<br/>\n&gt; hour total on any given day.

This sounds so much like my son Aaron.  Even his pretend play<br/>\nwith figures always sounds like a video game, complete with levels,<br/>\nhit points, and bosses.  He will set up an incredible scenario and<br/>\nhave my assigned little toy go through it complete with battles.  Some<br/>\nday he might be an awesome computer game creator.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, lots of little boys sound like walking video games.  I have<br/>\nread that over 80% of the verbalization that small boys make are just<br/>\nsounds like bangs, whistles, swooshing swords, crashing hot wheels, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLimiting my sons&#39; time with computers and video games backfired big<br/>\ntime.  It caused them, in a typically Aspie way, to obsess about their<br/>\ntime on the games down to the last second, and when they weren&#39;t<br/>\nallowed to play, their mind was obsessing about the game, thinking<br/>\nabout when they would be allowed to play again and what they would do.<br/>\n Often they would retreat and then when we asked what they were<br/>\nthinking about it was the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nReleasing the limits actually freed my boys from that bondage. <br/>\nKnowing that they could play their games as much as they really wanted<br/>\nto helped them let go of the obsessing and anxiety, they could<br/>\ncomplete their games and then put down the controller and walk away<br/>\nfeeling happy and satisfied and go on to something else.  They could<br/>\nalso choose not to play, knowing that later they would be able to pick<br/>\nit up if they wanted to. <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting a DVR meant that they could tape the shows they love if we are<br/>\nbusy outside the house and didn&#39;t spend the entire outing worrying<br/>\nabout what they were missing or if we would get home in time, and<br/>\ncould enjoy the activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of limiting the video games, you *could* use them as a way to<br/>\nconnect with your autistic son, to draw him into a world where you are<br/>\ninterested and talking to him about the games, and building a<br/>\nrelationship with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe use the Sims and Sims 2 character maker as a way to help Aaron<br/>\nfocus on people&#39;s faces and expressions.  He sits on his older<br/>\nsister&#39;s lap while playing, and they laugh and talk and hug and<br/>\ndiscuss the people they make and how they look and make decisions<br/>\nabout clothes and hair and their expressions and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nAaron and I play a game while we are playing Pokemon Colesseum where<br/>\nwe both cross our fingers and chant, &quot;pretty please&quot; together,<br/>\n(sometimes fast, sometimes slowly, sometimes loudly, sometimes softly)<br/>\nuntil we know whether or not the pokemon we are trying to catch will<br/>\nstay in the poke ball.  This is called emotion sharing and referencing<br/>\nin therapy circles, where the activities are artificial and designed<br/>\nto emphasize these things, but for us, it is just part of our<br/>\nenjoyment of an activity together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my suggestion would be that instead of seeing his joys and passions<br/>\nand hobbies as something that interferes with your relationship with<br/>\nhim, start seeing them as possibly a place to start to connect.

That includes computer,<br/>\nTV, videos, LeapPad, etc.  It really makes a world of<br/>\ndifference.  Even so, he will literally talk like a<br/>\nvideo game with sound effects, beeps and clicks, hand<br/>\ngestures (there&#39;s a name for what he does with his<br/>\nhands but I can&#39;t remember it), and is almost<br/>\ncompletely unresponsive when we speak to him,<br/>\nsometimes for entire days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost track of my question/thought but hope this<br/>\nmay provide additional insight that can help me<br/>\ncontinue to gather information from all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks, again!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: The elderkinder do not live with us but are<br/>\nadored, cherished and worshipped when they do get to<br/>\nbe here.

It&#39;s a long story that I will <br/>\nbabble later :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the time we&#39;ve been doing (or not doing) this, it appears to me <br/>\nthat I am much more inclined to an unschooling approach.  I still <br/>\nhave many personal hurdles to jump to feel like I&#39;m REALLY in an <br/>\nunschooling way but I&#39;m slowly finding people who are helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest concern we have is that our little guy has some disorders <br/>\nthat make communication difficult and affect him physically as well.  <br/>\nWe initially had diagnoses of autism, PDD-NOS, speech disorders and <br/>\nsensory integration dysfunction.  Ellis is my third kiddo and I knew <br/>\nfrom the time he was about 2 months old that he was not &#39;usual&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe pursued SI therapy which helped a great deal initially in terms of <br/>\nhis coordination and many sensitivities.  He spent two years in half-<br/>\ntime public school special ed which was a great experience and did <br/>\nwonders for him because of an incredible teacher.  We were lulled <br/>\ninto thinking he would have this kind of treatment for the rest of <br/>\nhis school days.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy were we wrong.  He was declared &#39;normal&#39; in April, 2004 and <br/>\ngraduated to &#39;regular&#39; kindergarten.  Our concerns were dismissed.  <br/>\nWe were patted on the head and told to leave him to the <br/>\nprofessionals.  The principal said, &quot;We&#39;ve had LOTS of kids like <br/>\nEllis.  We know what we&#39;re doing.&quot;  In spite of this, he started <br/>\nkindergarten in fall with a teacher I despised on sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was broken after six school days.  We withdrew him on the 7th <br/>\nschool day and the office staff person read my letter, then <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Well is he coming today?  Because it takes us 24 hours to <br/>\nprocess the paperwork and he&#39;ll get an unexcused absence.&quot;  I was <br/>\nspeechless (a rarity).  As if I CARED about an unexcused absence?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is how we accidentally started homeschooling - with no <br/>\nforethought, no planning, no clue.  The only real obsession I have is <br/>\nthat Ellis read, and read well.  To me, that is a key to almost <br/>\neverything else he will want to explore on his own.  And we&#39;re book <br/>\njunkies anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problems we encounter are that Ellis does not engage in &#39;normal&#39; <br/>\nkid things.  He has the kindest heart in the world.  He has some <br/>\nphysical weaknesses and sensitivities that limit his interest in a <br/>\nlot of things.  He has a crazy sense of humor and giggles <br/>\nconstantly.  But he retreats into his head and doesn&#39;t come out <br/>\nexcept in the form of video games.  He is absolutely obsessed with <br/>\nanything that has a screen and once he goes into that &#39;place&#39;, he&#39;s <br/>\ngone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m wondering if anyone has similar experiences and what might <br/>\nhelp to give a kid like Ellis a chance to wonder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106212,"nextTopicId":106218}}
