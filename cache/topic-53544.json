I must be a<br/>\nlight-weight.  :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can build up to it gradually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey had spent the night, on the night of the worst wind I ever remember <br/>\nhere.  58 mph, I heard.  Scary.  I woke up a couple of times to shine a <br/>\nmaglight out the window in the room next to me to see if the door of the room <br/>\nwhere they were (NOT next to me) was still closed.  I had bad visions of it <br/>\nblowing open and shattering glass.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt did blow open, but not until after the sun was up and after they were <br/>\nawake anyway.  Holly and those three had slept in the library and heard that <br/>\nwind all night (though most of them said they slept through it, once they <br/>\nwent to sleep around midnight).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that same night, more like 11:30, the fireplace lost its battle to send <br/>\nsmoke up, and the wind started sending the smoke DOWN.  BAD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst we broke the fire apart, scattered the parts.  But it was HOT.  <br/>\nSo we brought in cold ashes from a bucket in the yard and tried to bury it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBad plan.  Not only it was still smoking, but now the wind had ashes to blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got a squirt bottle of water and sprayed a REALLY hot fire.  Then I <br/>\nsprayed the air.  We had a fan blowing air out of the den (into the next <br/>\nroom, an enclosed porch) and &quot;only&quot; four room got very smoky.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never put a fire out with water in a fireplace before.  I&#39;m glad I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad I was still awake.  The kids would&#39;ve probably freaked out and <br/>\nclosed the flue, which would have saved us from the wind, but not from the <br/>\nremaining fire/smoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a learning experience, but I was tired and not in the mood for a <br/>\nlearning experience.<br/>\nI guess those are some of the best kinds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53543,"nextTopicId":53545}}
