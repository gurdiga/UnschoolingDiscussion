There is nothing more satisfying than to see a rose bloom for the first time in the spring.  Or to harvest a big head of cauliflower from the veggie garden.  Buy some easy to grow seeds for your kids like green beans, zucchini, corn, radishes, carrots, marigolds and sunflowers!  Sunflowers are amazing for kids because they grow so tall!  And from such a small seed!  Just plant them and water and voila!  We made a bean tee-pee which is fun for the kids, because after the beans cover the poles, the kids can climb inside and play!  As far as learning, I would get the Sunset guide for yourself.  That is our gardening bible.  Try to get as many free catalogs as you can, they always contain good helpful info.  Subscribe to gardening magazines like Sunset.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo start a vegetable garden, just scrape off a piece of soil, free from weeds and grass, (30&#39; x 20&#39; is a good size to start with) in your yard that gets at least 6 hours of sun, then add some amendments like compost; purchased to start with then you can make your own from green waste and kitchen scraps (no animal products).  Work the amendments into the soil, plant your seeds according to the back of your seed packets water, weed (mulching helps), feed with fertilizer and enjoy!  If you have a problem with rabbits or dogs you will need a fence around your garden.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD&#39;s love to garden and my 15 yo grows chile peppers and has quite an extensive collection of cacti and succulents!
