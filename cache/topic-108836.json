Sorry for the goofy formating.  <br/>\nI copied it from Unschooling.info message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]\">http://www.stagecast.com/&quot;]</a>Stagecast Creator[/url] is a good  <br/>\n&gt; place to start. He can start making games immediately by just  <br/>\n&gt; moving objects around the screen and the program writes the code  <br/>\n&gt; for him. But the code is editable so he can start tinkering with it  <br/>\n&gt; at any time. They have some really great tutorials that will get  <br/>\n&gt; him started quickly. There&#39;s a demo version that limits you to just  <br/>\n&gt; a few objects. And, no, he won&#39;t need to know math to program [;)]  <br/>\n&gt; But he&#39;ll pick it up as he goes along! [:D]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And something I just found out is that you can write games in  <br/>\n&gt; Flash. The great thing about Flash is that he can put his games up  <br/>\n&gt; on the internet and let his friends play [:)] (Flash also does  <br/>\n&gt; animation among other things.) Macromedia offers a [i]generous[/i]  <br/>\n&gt; discount for educators (including homeschoolers). (It&#39;s $99 at the  <br/>\n&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-\">http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/store/index.cfm?store=OLS-</a> <br/>\n&gt; EDU&quot;]Education Store[/url]) (It says homeschoolers qualify at their  <br/>\n&gt; discretion. If they turn you down I found this list of academic  <br/>\n&gt; discounters at Adobe that sell their software (among other things):  <br/>\n&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]\">https://www.academic-collegiate.com/products.htm&quot;]</a>Academic &  <br/>\n&gt; Collegiate Software[/url]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, if he thinks he might be interested in doing webpages, you  <br/>\n&gt; might give serious consideration to the suite of programs (Studio  <br/>\n&gt; MX 2004 for $100 more) that includes Dreamweaver (for creating  <br/>\n&gt; webpages), Flash and 2 art programs. (We&#39;ve both used Fireworks a  <br/>\n&gt; lot for drawing.) (Without the educator&#39;s discount it&#39;s like $600 [: <br/>\n&gt; 0]) Most of the big internet service providers (AOL, Earthlink and  <br/>\n&gt; such) have walkthroughs to put up simple webpages so Dreamweaver  <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t necessary but it is nice if he has the urge for less generic  <br/>\n&gt; [:)]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are [i]loads[/i] of tutorials about Flash on the internet. A  <br/>\n&gt; good beginning might be the Quicktime videos at [url=&quot;http:// <br/>\n&gt; www.cartoonsmart.com/&quot;]Cartoon Smart[/url]. Scroll down to the  <br/>\n&gt; bottom and there&#39;s one for Video Games. The freebies we  <br/>\n&gt; downloaded ... well he didn&#39;t edit out his &quot;Oops, didn&#39;t mean to do  <br/>\n&gt; that&quot;s [;)] but they were very easy to use. You just run Flash and  <br/>\n&gt; Quicktime at the same time and follow along with what he does. You  <br/>\n&gt; can pause and back up just like with a video.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve also heard good things about [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ambrosiasw.com/\">http://www.ambrosiasw.com/</a> <br/>\n&gt; games/coldstone/&quot;]Coldstone Game Engine[/url] for developing RPGs.  <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a demo version at the website to download. I don&#39;t have any  <br/>\n&gt; personal experience with it though. If you type Coldstone and  <br/>\n&gt; review into Google, that should turn some information up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (For non-Macophiles, as far as I know the above are all available  <br/>\n&gt; for Windoze too. There&#39;s also Dark Basic that I&#39;ve heard really  <br/>\n&gt; good things about and for which there&#39;s a ton of support and  <br/>\n&gt; tutorials. And my daughter took a 2 week full day course at  <br/>\n&gt; [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]\">http://video-game.internaldrive.com/&quot;]</a>ID Tech Camps[/url]  <br/>\n&gt; where they used [url=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clickteam.com/English/\">http://www.clickteam.com/English/</a> <br/>\n&gt; multimedia_fusion.htm&quot;]Multimedia Fusion[/url] which she really  <br/>\n&gt; liked.
