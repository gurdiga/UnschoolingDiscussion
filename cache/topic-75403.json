Thot once I was out of school, they went away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I started researching it, as i have to make recommendations to the management on how to bring the newly re-organized dep&#39;t together, and found www.bullyonline.org and WOW!  That&#39;s a breathe of fresh air!  Racists attack your colour/race.  Bullies attack your competence/popularity!<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, in 2 of the last 3 jobs I had, **I** was bullied and thot that was management!  Sheesh!  What a wimp I was. Went all passive to protect myself (yep, that&#39;s on the site as a normal reaction to bullying). Anyway, the web site&#39;s author had it reallllly bad at work, lost job, family, the works.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;d like to get bullying stories from you articulate folks.  Kids or adults who got bullied.  And stories of deling with it - help me with these three &quot;queen bees.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nTim T<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75401,"nextTopicId":75123}}
