(This ability, btw, torqued my first <br/>\ngrade teacher, who hated me) And I&#39;ve loved reading ever since. I was <br/>\nthe kid you see walking down the street with her nose in a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother was reading by second grade, I&#39;m pretty sure, but he never <br/>\nloved it like I did. Favorite books for him were the &quot;...Do the <br/>\nStrangest Things&quot; series and the &quot;Meet George Wasington et al&quot; To <br/>\nthis day, he isn&#39;t a reader of novels. Magazines? I think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister enjoys reading, and is involved in a book discussion group. <br/>\nBut I think she reads those books because being in a book group <br/>\nis &quot;the thing to do&quot; more than just reading for sheer pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom: a pleasure reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad: a novel-once-a-year, with Smithsonian level magazines in <br/>\nbetween his Michener binges.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest child, now 24, was in second grade when reading clicked for <br/>\nhim. He reads when he has to, but isn&#39;t a novel or even a magazine <br/>\nreader.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own home, I and my 17 year old are the voracious readers. My 12 <br/>\nyear old boy reads now and then. He is perfectly capable, but reading <br/>\nisn&#39;t his main brain stimulus.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, who has dyslexia and has a brain injury, is a slow and <br/>\nplodding reader, with many starts and stops. I have no idea if this <br/>\nis from the dyslexia or the brain injury. But he is capable of <br/>\nreading, and started reading late, according to his mother. He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t remember what age he was when he started reading, but it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t by age 7. He doesn&#39;t read novels, but gobbles up the Popular <br/>\nScience and Pop Mechanics, as well as religious books.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s my 10 year old, who wants to read VERY much, for whom it <br/>\nis just not clicking yet. Who has had phonics and sight reading cards <br/>\nand many other helps. For whom it STILL is not clicking, yet. I <br/>\nsuspect hers is a spatial brain, like her dad&#39;s. (aka dyslexia) She <br/>\nlistens to books on tape, watches videos about things that interest <br/>\nher (big cats are her passion. And birds, right now) and I read to <br/>\nher sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe blessing is, she hasn&#39;t had to deal with frustration <br/>\nand &quot;failure&quot; in the context of the classroom. She hasn&#39;t had other <br/>\nkids giving her grief.

I&#39;d read <br/>\nalong until we got to that word, then he&#39;d say his word and we&#39;d <br/>\nmove on. We moved up gradually to multiple words (2 or 3 in one <br/>\nstory). Then we&#39;d alternate words, then sentences. If DS got to a <br/>\nword that didn&#39;t fit what he already knew, we&#39;d stop and look at it, <br/>\nthen move on. For example (since it&#39;s hard to explain), he <br/>\nknew &quot;water&quot;. Then he got a book on &quot;weather&quot;. Apply what he already <br/>\nknew &quot;w&quot;+&quot;at&quot;+&quot;er&quot; but that didn&#39;t fit. So we touched on &quot;ea&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;th&quot;. Now he&#39;s got 5 &quot;building blocks&quot; instead of just 3, <br/>\nwithout trying to memorize rules with more exceptions than <br/>\nregularities (ah the joys of the English language!lol). One key (I <br/>\nthink) to this was knowing the letters and sounds and picking up <br/>\nbasic sight words first to provide a foundation to work from. We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t use any of the standard &quot;lists of sight words&quot; - just <br/>\nwhatever words we came across a lot &quot;Exit&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Thank <br/>\nyou&quot;, &quot;Blue&#39;s Clues&quot; &quot;Go, Dog, Go&quot; and suchlike. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne video that was helpful was Sesame Street&#39;s Do the Alphabet - a <br/>\nparticularly good part was that the main character (Baby Bear) <br/>\nwanted help because he kept forgetting the letters - he&#39;d go A,B,C,D <br/>\nand get lost. So Big Bird and the gang helped with letters and <br/>\nsounds. And in the end, Baby Bear did it! It helped DS to have <br/>\nconfidence that he&#39;d eventually get it, didn&#39;t have to have it all <br/>\nright away. Admittedly, that might be a little young for your 7 yr <br/>\nold. I liked that they used a different tune for the alphabet song <br/>\nso it avoided the &quot;lmnop&quot; all as one &quot;letter&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Helping almost 7 year old read","postDate":"1109341051","msgId":103947,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhlLjIxZGE5YjFjLjJmNTA4ZDdiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103943,"nextInTopic":103948,"prevInTime":103946,"nextInTime":103948,"topicId":103930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/24/2005 6:36:13 PM Central Standard Time, brewstersears@sympatico.ca writes: I m not  sure how to proceed - he s a happy kid, very glad","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1920769260\">In a message dated 2/24/2005 6:36:13 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brewstersears@...\">brewstersears@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not  sure how to proceed - he&#39;s a happy kid, very glad not to be in<br/>\nschool, but  still seems very interested in reading.<br/>\nWould you suggest a  different approach/program?

Reading, like learning to ride a bike or being a father or being <br/>\n responsible enough to stay home by yourself, is a &quot;some day&quot; kind of  thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs in, &quot;some day&quot; you&#39;ll be able to jump and touch the top of the  door <br/>\nframe.  &quot;Some day&quot; you&#39;ll be able to ride your bike the store by  yourself.  &quot;Some <br/>\nday&quot; you&#39;ll be able to cook dinner for the family.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a hopeful and matter-of-fact way of looking at it.  Recognizing  that <br/>\nthe brain develops as the body does, and not every body develops at the  same <br/>\nrate; nor does every brain.  His body and brain are changing and  developing and <br/>\nhe&#39;s different than anyone else.  Some read later, some  earlier.  He *will* <br/>\nread.  When he&#39;s ready.<br/>\n <br/>\nPass this idea on to him.  He could be lamenting that he can&#39;t  touch the top <br/>\nof the door frame by jumping.  Start by jumping to touch the  top of the <br/>\nfence, the net on the basketball goal, the edge of the stop sign on  the corner.  <br/>\nMy eldest son, at 6, cried because he didn&#39;t have as many  trophies as his dad <br/>\ndid.  &quot;But you will, son.  You will.&quot;  (He  did.)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest son just happened to learn to read at 7.  Having  discovered <br/>\nunschooling when he was a baby, I&#39;d never had anything but  confidence in his <br/>\nability to learn the things he wanted to learn when his  developing brain and body <br/>\nwere ready.  He grew up with that reality.   I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s why he <br/>\nlearned at 7 over any other age.  But I  believe that&#39;s why he never had any <br/>\nanxiety about it or frustration that he  couldn&#39;t do it, yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nBe hopeful and encouraging.  Don&#39;t focus on the can&#39;t.  Focus on  the will.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.thanksmom.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Helping almost 7 year old read","postDate":"1109305422","msgId":103943,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN2bTk4ZSs1ZjlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxODgwMWM1MWFiZSQ1MGU5NDM2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBybWJ3YzE+"},"prevInTopic":103940,"nextInTopic":103947,"prevInTime":103942,"nextInTime":103944,"topicId":103930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t have any insight as to what kind of program to use, but would it help him to let him know that lots of unschoolers arent reading proficiently at his","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1584936031\">I don&#39;t have any insight as to what kind of &quot;program&quot; to use, but <br/>\nwould it help him to let him know that lots of unschoolers arent <br/>\nreading proficiently at his age?
