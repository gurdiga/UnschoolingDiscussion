I too was starting to<br/>\nget annoyed with him as he&#39;d only nurse at  night once or twice.  He was<br/>\ngetting so big he was waking me up.  I decided it bothered me too much<br/>\nand also on the advice of a friend who nursed for along time as well we<br/>\ndecide he didn&#39;t need it.  We use the family bed and he sleeps with us.<br/>\nWhen he was nursing I&#39;d wear a short midriff shirt so he&#39;s have easy<br/>\naccess.  I just began wearing a long T-shirt so he couldn&#39;t get to it.<br/>\nHe whimpered a bit and tried to pull up my shirt.  After a night or two<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t complain and just cuddled up against me and fell asleep.   He<br/>\nhad also nursed to sleep while I&#39;d read to him.   Well I still read him<br/>\nto sleep but he can fall asleep in the car, in front of the TV with<br/>\nDad.  My son is now 6 1/2.  As to how it affected fertility I don&#39;t know<br/>\nsince we weren&#39;t trying at the time.   We did try to get pregnant the<br/>\nlast year or so and have decided now that one child is enough.

How do people<br/>\nhave more than one child?<br/>\n<br/>\nAn different nursing story.  When I was no longer employed outside of<br/>\nthe home and my son was a bit over two he stopped nursing cold turkey<br/>\nfor 2 1/2 days.  He didn&#39;t have any physical condition.  I was<br/>\nuncomfortable physically and an emotional wreck (partly due to hormone<br/>\ndrop).  When I asked him later why he stopped, he said he just wanted<br/>\nfind out what he was like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14477,"nextTopicId":14496}}
