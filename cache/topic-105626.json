Partly it depends what they want from that other family. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids played with all kinds of other kids when they were little.  It was <br/>\neasiest when the parents also had a LLL background.  It was hardest when the <br/>\nother families were nit-picky controlling parents who didn&#39;t want the kids to <br/>\ntake their shoes off, EVER.  It was easier with a family whose kids could strip <br/>\nnekkid and run in the sprinklers.  It was easier when the other kids themselves <br/>\nwere fine with saying, &quot;No thanks, I shouldn&#39;t have milk,&quot; or &quot;Do you have <br/>\njuice?&quot; rather than having a kid show up with a list of what they couldn&#39;t or <br/>\nmust do.   It was easier for my kids to play where they could get a drink if <br/>\nthey were thirsty and some food if they were hungry, than places where the other <br/>\nkids were being starved so they&#39;d clean their plates, and my kids were going <br/>\nhome before dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything counts, but rarely does everything have to count all at the same <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105601,"nextTopicId":105619}}
