Letting the kids know how others <br/>\nmay feel.<br/>\nI think when kids &quot;mess up&quot;, break something, say something mean, hit, hurt, <br/>\nthose types, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt. They are children. <br/>\nLearning to live amongst others. They are not born with all the social skills <br/>\nprogrammed so that they KNOW what is right or wrong, they need to learn it. <br/>\nWe &quot;teach&quot; them by modeling the behavior that we want them to pick up. If we <br/>\nwant them to say please and ask for things in a polite manner, then WE <br/>\n(adults) need to do the same.
