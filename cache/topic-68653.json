That is ALL the law states.  No other requirements.  Homeschoolers can enter college with the College president&#39;s signature - takes about an hour.  Yet if you asked a teacher or principal, or worse a school board administrator, they would tell you a attendance etc. is mandatory/preferred.  And they&#39;ll tell you that a child will NEVER get into a college without a high school diploma. (They don&#39;t know/aren&#39;t telling that great colleges are head-hunting for homeschoolers because they can think!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that if one teacher can approve you and another won&#39;t then the law may weigh in your favour.  My suggestion to you is that, if you haven&#39;t done so already, you understand the law in Florida, not anyone&#39;s interpretation.  Use a lawyer even.  Or a law student.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if the laws are weak here, perhaps there are no REAL consequences to NOT getting your info package to they on time (if at all, as the law here in BC states) and you can take the time to seek a more sympathetic teacher.
