Tell your daughter that her television watching is going<br/>\nto be limited from now on to a couple-three hours a day, one of which<br/>\nwill be educational television like on the discovery channel. Have you<br/>\ntaken her on field trips locally around the area where you live? Is she<br/>\ninvolved in anything like 4h, girl scouts, etc? Maybe she could use some<br/>\nphysical activity like riding lessons, swimming, or other sports. Get the<br/>\ntimberdoodle catalog from www.timberdoodle.com. They have some really<br/>\ninteresting things in there like sign language or other languages as a<br/>\nforeign language. Have her do at least one or two  math worksheets a<br/>\nweek. Sewing and baking come and go in spurts...just like for the rest of<br/>\nus. Take her to the library and have her pick out videos or books that<br/>\nshe is interested in. Maybe have her volunteer to help with storytime at<br/>\nthe library? IF she is going through puberty, that could also be part of<br/>\nit. She is not challenging herself and has forgotten how to really<br/>\nchallenge herself. Are either of you artistic? Have you any hobbies? Why<br/>\nnot take up a new one yourself and invite her to learn along with you? I<br/>\nam a rubber stamper and my daughter started at age 4, same time I did.<br/>\nI&#39;m also a cross stitcher and Naomi wants to learn that...she also has<br/>\nher own pony beads to make critters as well as a latch hook rug to work<br/>\non at her own pace.

Not because she is lazy - but simple because she is <br/>\nbored.  Bored from getting up, untill her ps friend comes around <br/>\nafter school.<br/>\n<br/>\nh/s was dd choice.  It still is.  She does not want to go back to <br/>\nschool - but she needs motivation.  (I must add that I love h/s and <br/>\nwould be very disappointed if she did say she wanted to go to school)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have bought a sewing machine as she showed an interest in this - we <br/>\nhave a key board - computer - paints and glue and paper and reading <br/>\nbooks - workbooks and worksheets and fun games - board games and <br/>\ncards and lots of other things........ dd doesnt want to do any of <br/>\nthese.  She is bored of baking and no longer interested in science <br/>\nexperiments........<br/>\n<br/>\nH E L P<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17095,"nextTopicId":17096}}
