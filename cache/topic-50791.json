We are checking into those trailer/type campers,  pretty reasonably priced.   But I love the campfires and all that stuff,,,so,,,hmm<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know about trying to lug a tent through airports!  I know my dh doesn&#39;t think that sounds very fun.  And he&#39;d probably be the one carrying it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBrenda,  what type of sleeping accomodations are you considering?<br/>\n <br/>\nShyrley,  you bring a tent from the US?<br/>\n <br/>\nIs anyone else out there thinking about going over?   From the states?   It is very reasonably priced,  airfare, in May, to England is pretty resonable,  I know, tho&#39; , it still is several hundred dollars for five of us so, I do have to add it all up.    My in-laws might want to go over too,  so that would be fun too.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway,  again I&#39;m rambling to 900 people, sorry!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli<br/>\n Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a>&gt; wrote:11/25/02 22:12:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hesfes itself is pretty cheap. �34 for adults and �25 for kids.
