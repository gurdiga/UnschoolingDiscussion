He had one<br/>\nwhen we were in California, but the contract ended and they laid everyone<br/>\noff.  WE have been in ND for ten years, and he has worked for farmers. They<br/>\nLOVE having him, but he is tired of the all work and no pay jobs.  He is<br/>\ngoing on a mission&#39;s trip next week, going to put in an autoclave and do<br/>\nsome wiring at a mission hospital in Haiti, but when he gets back he will be<br/>\njob hunting. Hope to find that big company that will give him a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is really quite talented, can fix anything, and understands mathematics<br/>\nintuitively without every going beyond high school.  It amazes me.  He<br/>\nactually uses things like the Pythgorean thereom to build things, etc.  I<br/>\njust thought it was just some dumb thing I had to memorize (speaking from an<br/>\nEnglish major&#39;s point of view!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will pass this post on to the hubby!<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nerin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; One brother just got a job working for the state,  entry level,  worked<br/>\n </span></blockquote>his way up and found his niche,   he struggled through high school and<br/>\nstarted working for the state at 18,  he&#39;s now 42.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My other brother also struggled through high school.

He then worked with some docs as a<br/>\nrespitory therapist and told them of some ideas he had for improving some of<br/>\ntheir devices.
