What he has discovered is that unless you want to spend <br/>\nclose to 1000 bucks or more, there isn&#39;t a lot of difference between <br/>\na $300 telescope and a GOOD pair of binoculars.  They have binoculars <br/>\ndesigned for astronomy for around $300. Some benefits of binoculars <br/>\nwere pointed out to him including wider viewing range, portability, <br/>\netc.  He was also advised to get binoculars that had special motors <br/>\nthat would not shake to help with viewing space.
