I would apologize to the kids and smoothe things over after <br/>\ntheir dad was a yuck sometimes.  I would talk to him later and say I thought <br/>\nmaybe he could have said this instead of that.

So I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to say that, he just gradually realized that it really WAS okay for our <br/>\nkids to be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; All of this has caused so much friction in our home it just puts <br/>\nme in a mood. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would tell him that.

We met when Dustin was 3 1/2 and <br/>\nDustin and he got along great the first year and then we moved into our new <br/>\nhome and boom!<br/>\nMy husband nags, its never done right or good enough for hubby and he often <br/>\npushes Dustin away. I have spoken with hubby and asked that he lighten up and <br/>\nhe always has a come back like well he never does anything or I told him to do <br/>\nit this way. All of this has caused so much friction in our home it just puts <br/>\nme in a mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is great with the other two 3 &1 (his). His dad is the same way <br/>\nbut he hates that he was raised the way he was and still has some upsets over <br/>\nthat. He is a very technical fact kinda guy.  But he is critical. For instance <br/>\nthis am hubby asked D to help him with the rabbit cage. I said (after D came in <br/>\nupset about having to pick up a bunch of poop he dropped) &quot;let him pick it up <br/>\n(d was fine with) but please don&#39;t criticize him for how well its done.&quot; When <br/>\nD was done hubby came out back to rake more up and made another little wagon <br/>\nfull for him. ugh<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night it was something else he ended up getting mad at D and grabbed him <br/>\nwhen D said something sarcastic to him. This time I didn&#39;t say a word I just <br/>\nlooked at him when he came in and a bit later he apologized and they hugged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of stress over money and bills but I am wondering what I can <br/>\ndo or not do to help this situation. I love my husband and my son but I do not <br/>\nwant this battle to get any worse than it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75759,"nextTopicId":76005}}
