I <br/>\nthink I have just gotten to the point in my life where I have truly let go <br/>\nof the power that things like school have over me. In the dream I actually <br/>\nthought it was dumb that I was stressing over an institution like school. <br/>\nEven in my subconscious I believe unschooling is best. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN 8 helps eliminate e-mail viruses.
