The older sister<br/>\nis 16, not exactly a baby and they are obviously able to take care of<br/>\nthemselves.   Do any of you have any idea how traumatic it is to have a<br/>\npolice force insert themselves into your live when you have not asked for it<br/>\nand do not desire their &#39;help&#39;?  Take my word for it, no matter how this<br/>\nends, it will never end for these children.  They will have this event as a<br/>\nturning point for their entire lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;sigh&gt;  No easy answers.  Here&#39;s hoping the kids manage to not make their<br/>\ncircumstances so bad in the eyes of some authority person that this haunts<br/>\nthem for the rest of their lives AND that no one is seriously injured<br/>\n(family under &#39;siege, law enforcement OR neighbors)!<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In a message dated 6/1/01 3:37:58 AM Mountain Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; From the Washington Home Education Network list:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In WHEN@y..., &quot;Dale R.
