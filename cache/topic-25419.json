In my beliefs, we ARE all<br/>\nthe  children of God/dess so treating our kids as such - WOW! It never<br/>\nstruck home with me until whomever (Johanna?) posted that bit about<br/>\ntreating our kids as the messiah. Now I&#39;ve been making a list of things<br/>\nthat I say  that I  would NEVER say to Jesus or Buddha or Mohammet or<br/>\nTaliesin - and Ithink I&#39;m beginning to hear how I  must sound to my<br/>\nson.
