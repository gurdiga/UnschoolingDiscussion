What about the studies that discuss brain<br/>\nfunction during tv viewing?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n       Apart from the psychological issue of does-TV-breed-violence, the <br/>\nstudy findings I&#39;ve read suggest  that young brains physically develop more and <br/>\nricher neural pathways in  heavily-used areas. Use it or lose it. In other <br/>\nwords, TV changes the brain&#39;s hardwiring -- stimulation causes additional growth, <br/>\nwhile longterm lack of stimulation leads other pathways and synapses to <br/>\natrophy. <br/>\n<br/>\n       This doesn&#39;t only apply to rapid-fire screen stimulation like tv and <br/>\ncomputers, of course. It applies to everything about how the developing brain <br/>\nis or isn&#39;t used.<br/>\n<br/>\n       So at bottom those who interpret the research wind up making value <br/>\njudgments about which areas of the brain are &quot;better&quot; than others, especially as <br/>\nwe prepare children for their future. That means to live in future society, <br/>\nbut unfortunately it also usually mean for &quot;school.&quot; What amazes me is how so <br/>\nmany learned professionals in various fields, who don&#39;t otherwise act like <br/>\nLuddites, just stonewall the idea that tv-computer capabilities will be more and <br/>\nmore integrated into the daily environments of the future, and that therefore <br/>\nthe brains of people in the future had BETTER adapt to it! And that graowing <br/>\nbrains to do well in &quot;school&quot; might be in direct opposition to this goal!<br/>\n<br/>\n          Some will find this debate annoying no doubt, but for any <br/>\nunschooler who does want some links on the different perspectives, we chose to include <br/>\na few in PDE&#39;s Thinking Parent resources, as a sort of exercise in independent <br/>\nanalysis of education issues. <br/>\nPart 3: Thinking for the Future<br/>\n1) High Tech Debate: Does It Develop or Destroy Young Minds? -- Two adults <br/>\noffer very different views of how technology affects developing human minds -- <br/>\nNature Magazine&#39;s opinion is included below too. Or maybe the kids have already <br/>\nfigured it out?
