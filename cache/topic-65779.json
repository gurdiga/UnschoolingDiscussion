My 6.5 year old daughter was 100%<br/>\nbreastfed until around 18 months.  There was NOTHING anyone could do to<br/>\ntalk her into taking a bite of solid food.  It just wasn&#39;t going to<br/>\nhappen.  This included all medicines, etc., too.  One time we attempted<br/>\nto give her tylenol- she still has never had any medicine to this day.<br/>\nI read a medical study showing how if babies were allowed to eat the<br/>\nfoods that they choose, the more likely they were to not have any food<br/>\nallergies.  A different study said that the longer you waited to<br/>\nintroduce solids to a child genetically disposed for food allergies, the<br/>\nmore likely they will not have any.  Lots of food allergies run in both<br/>\nmine and DH&#39;s families.  My daughter who refused to eat solid foods<br/>\nuntil 18 months is allergic to NOTHING so far as we can tell.  She knew<br/>\nwhen her body would be able to handle different foods and I am so<br/>\nthankful that we always listened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she is my early talker.  She said her first word around 6 months<br/>\nold.  We wrote down all her words on her first birthday and we got 104.<br/>\nShe was talking in complete sentences at a year, often run-ons that were<br/>\n14+ words.  Breastfeeding makes the jaw stronger.  Anyone suggesting<br/>\notherwise is ignorant on the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  I hesitate to bring the following up because it sounds like a<br/>\nbrag, but I will in order to show all sides of reading development.  She<br/>\nwas/is also an early reader.  She started reading when she was 2 and she<br/>\ncurrently goes through more books that I can keep track of.  She loves<br/>\nto use them all as resource books, so she wants to keep most of what she<br/>\nreads.  We spend a lot of money on books.  She easily reads and<br/>\ncomprehends on an adult level and it is hard to find books where the<br/>\ncontent is appropriate for her, yet the language isn&#39;t too easy that she<br/>\nreads the book in less than an hour.  She loves books like the Mary-Kate<br/>\nand Ashley detective series ones and I buy them for her, but they only<br/>\nlast an hour or so (she does love to reread them and refer to them for<br/>\nquotes).  She has read all the Harry Potter books three times each.  She<br/>\ncan read the first three in one day each and the fourth in two days.  I,<br/>\nsimilarly, was a very early reader (truly reading books and maps at 3).<br/>\nNo one &quot;taught&quot; my daughter nor myself how to read, we both seemed to<br/>\njust be born thinking that way.
