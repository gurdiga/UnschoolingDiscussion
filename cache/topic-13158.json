SO that is all he needs for now if he gets lost.  Why on earth would his age be &quot;Vital&quot; information that he would need to know?  He doesn&#39;t care, and when people ask him and he does not answer, I do it for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if he ever gets lost and they need to call his name and age over a loudspeaker or some such, I would hope that the adults he is is the custody of are intelligent enough to hazard a reasonable guess.  I can&#39;t think of any other time when he would &quot;need&quot; to know.
