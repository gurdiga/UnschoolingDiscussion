I <br/>\nhave 2 kids, 3 y.o. girl and 5 y.o. boy.  There is no official start to <br/>\nhomeschooling of course, but I arbitrarily set the date we started <br/>\nunschooling as the morning when I showed them a spider in a web in our dining <br/>\nroom.  I caught a fly and sent it into the web for the spider&#39;s breakfast and <br/>\nthey were fascinated.<br/>\n       Actually from the reading I&#39;ve done on the subject of Unitarian <br/>\nhistory, I believe the word &quot;Unitarian&quot; comes from the theology of the <br/>\noriginal church when they broke from the mainstream Christian churches in <br/>\nTransylvania in the late 1600&#39;s.  They believed in God as a single entity, <br/>\nnot three different ones, hence the word Uni-tarian.  The idea of the trinity <br/>\nsolidified in the 6th century I think and various Christians have challenged <br/>\nit, claiming it is not based directly on scripture.<br/>\n       Unitarians, by the way, suffered greatly for their beliefs and perhaps <br/>\nbecause of that were tolerant of other sects and religions.  Several early <br/>\nAmericans were Unitarian, including Thomas Jefferson, who also rejected the <br/>\ndivinity of Christ.  I haven&#39;t read much on this, but Unitarians&#39; tolerance <br/>\npossibly inspired the founding fathers to adopt religious tolerance as an <br/>\nimportant ingredient of U.S. democracy.<br/>\n       The UU Church (Unitarian Universalist) is not officially Christian, <br/>\nbut some members are believers or are very sympathetic to Christian ideas in <br/>\ngeneral.  In our religious education we draw on other faiths a lot and even <br/>\nhave the young people attend services at other churches and temples, <br/>\nincluding Buddhist, Muslim, etc.  Occaisionally members object to readings <br/>\nfrom the bible during service but I do not - I like it.  I am personally a <br/>\ndevout agnostic.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I&#39;ve been enjoying the list but have found I have to be awfully quick <br/>\nwith the delete button or I spend more than an hour doing this.  Nice to meet <br/>\nyou all.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38978,"nextTopicId":38858}}
