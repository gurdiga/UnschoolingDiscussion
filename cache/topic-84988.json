Some are Norse legends.  So, I was curious what<br/>\n&gt; your children are reading.  My daughter is 9, and I&#39;m looking for content<br/>\n&gt; that would be appropriate for a 9yo&#39;s sensibilities although lately she<br/>\n&gt; seems to be able to handle scary stuff, which most of history seems to<br/>\n&gt; be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks, Ruth<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; The best thing to hit the internet in years - Juno SpeedBand!<br/>\n&gt; Surf the web up to FIVE TIMES FASTER!<br/>\n&gt; Only $14.95/ month - visit www.juno.com to sign up today!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
