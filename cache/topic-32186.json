And as Dona wrote, we have as many regional variants in Canada as do<br/>\ny&#39;all south of the border.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not heard, either, of &quot;Oxford&quot; English being touted as superior, although<br/>\n&quot;RP&quot;, Received Pronunciation, has been taught in British acting and broadcasting<br/>\nschools as the &quot;standard&quot;, as has Standard American in the United States.<br/>\nActors here in Canada who haven&#39;t learned these standard forms  take classes to<br/>\nimprove their employability.  American movies require American accents.  No,<br/>\nthat&#39;s not true, sometimes they want folks to sound as if they might come from<br/>\nNewfoundland, or have a trace of a Yiddish accent (and for that, Montreal or<br/>\nToronto can be as authentic as New York).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have met individuals in  places east and west, Canadian and American, who<br/>\nbelieve that the way they talk is right, and who chuckle at the peculiar<br/>\nlinguistic ways of folks from other areas..<br/>\n<br/>\nI lived with someone from Waterbury, Connecticut once, who moaned every time a<br/>\nBritish movie came on television.  He said he couldn&#39;t understand a word.   His<br/>\nfamily (which emigrated from Italy when he was three years old) laughed at the<br/>\nway I talked, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, an intelligent, well educated actor type carries with him from<br/>\nchildhood the traces of a belief that folks with English accents are a little<br/>\nstuck up.  His ear isn&#39;t always quick to pick up class and regional differences<br/>\nin those speakers.   My friends and I were raised in a hotbed of ex-pat Brits in<br/>\npost-war Ottawa, even if our own parents were born in Canada, and our ears<br/>\nabsorbed all of those sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s aunt, who was raised in South Dakota and settled into a teaching<br/>\ncareer in Arkansas as a young woman, used to ask me to repeat things on the<br/>\ntelephone because I sounded so &quot;cute&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s my point?

I enjoyed it even when I was actually working as an English<br/>\nteacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only place I&#39;ve been pressured to change my dialect  was at acting school in<br/>\nNew York, where we were all required to learn and use Standard American.
