The wildlife in our area is of constant  interest to us-not something we take for granted. The elk however have caused some of our neighbours huge costs in feed. Most farmers leave any  rain ruined hay in the field for them.  The little  hay  they get from around  our pony is very minor now that we have adjusted our feeding schedule. She is a little 32 year old welsh mare and they  are three times her size. They are actually very welcome, I just feel a little uneasy because of her size and age.<br/>\nYears ago they were  much wilder as they were hunted quite heavily in our area and their were huge tracts of heavy timber all around us. 35 years ago my husband and I tried to follow  the trail of some  through heavy fir timber right next to oour fence on horseback and I had to basically kneel on the saddle  as they were able to thread their horse size bodies and huge racks  thru amazingly heavy going.They are not in any sense tame but are quite capable of assessing danger and as long as you follow your regular paths and routine they only move off slowly-if you stare directly at them for any length of time they  move off quickly.  It is very exciting to walk on old logging  roads  and suddenly see  a group of them cross in front of you. They move so quietly you really dont see anything.<br/>\n The girls take them for granted in a way,  but are always thrilled if  they see the young deer  up close on the driveway or front field  when they go picking wild strawberries. <br/>\nWe have a number of bird feeders  by the house but the squirrels seldom come up to them-they are usually &quot;hibernating&quot; <br/>\n(they dont really) they  just  burrow in and  &quot;sleep&quot; in this weather and come out when it warms up and raid their cone caches which  are out in the field or bush a bit. They are fun to watch but the cats can be hard on them so they are smart to stay away. Luckily for us,  the squirrels and the  Canada geese  are not  nuisances  around here  like they are in some  areas.<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] elk -- was helping with reading","postDate":"1072673014","msgId":86998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhGMjM1RkVBLTM5QjktMTFEOC04MDI2LTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdFMDVFQjJFLTM5QjYtMTFEOC04MDI2LTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEY1MTFBQTVFLTM5NTgtMTFEOC1BMEM2LTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+IDwwMDE3MDFjM2NkYjQkYTY0YmQxZTAkMWRlMGI1ZDBAR3JhY2VQZW5uPiA8N0UwNUVCMkUtMzlCNi0xMUQ4LTgwMjYtMDAwMzkzQTVEQTY2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":86996,"nextInTopic":87001,"prevInTime":86997,"nextInTime":86999,"topicId":86961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmmm.... that wasn t quite worded the way I meant it to sound the first time.

If I say anything more so it sounds like a bit of &quot;reading instruction&quot; Kara usually either  &quot;goes ballistic&quot; or  quits whatever she is reading Immediately<br/>\nWe  did the phonics  book ....&quot;Hundred Lessons&quot; when they were 5/6  and tried &quot;homeschooling&quot; before we moved to unschooling in  April  03.<br/>\nKara has  a lot of difficulty  but  at this  point absolutely refuses  to &quot;sound things out and screams that she is never going to :-) I have dropped  saying that (almost)  entirely with her.Their reading gets better all the time but  they do no  required reading outloud or reading lessons of any kind.  Their reading/writing now is all done in the context of an e-mail they wish to send-signs-notes they write for their games-instructions  for their video games etc..<br/>\nWe are truly amazed at how well they read doing it this way. They used to always like to be read to daily but now usually say no thanks. They get tons of books home from the library weekly still.We read some to them if they like-they look at some-   Stephanie  reads some of them and I dont even know  she  did until I ask if this should go back to the library and  she  says oh sure  I read it it tells about how....<br/>\nNeither are  &quot;readers&quot;-boo hoo-  Kara  has dyslexic tendencies  and has problems taking in  auditory information.<br/>\nShe is the computer-video game whiz. Can totally concentrate on solving them  for hours.<br/>\nAnd how do I deal with all this?   I really try.. usually it is great..  sometimes I brood about  what if I am totally screwing up...sometimes like Kara I &quot; go ballistic&quot;  unfortunately that  tendency has been the bane of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n Where  the girls  friend just phoned and now they want to be 15 miles from here &quot;right away&quot; but   have pulled out some toys on the table...so better go and see what the agenda is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147376218,"authorName":"liza sabater","from":"liza sabater &lt;listdiva@...&gt;","profile":"lm_sabater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] helping with reading","postDate":"1072631523","msgId":86980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1MTFBQTVFLTM5NTgtMTFEOC1BMEM2LTAwMDM5M0I4NEZCNkBjdWx0dXJla2l0Y2hlbi5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYjMwMWMzY2Q1NiQ2MjVlM2FkMCQ5NGU5YjI0MUBTVUU+"},"prevInTopic":86977,"nextInTopic":86987,"prevInTime":86979,"nextInTime":86981,"topicId":86961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So when I read to him I sometimes <br/>\ncover the beginning or ending sound he does not know. Then he feels his <br/>\nway to the word. I also made word domino cards. We play with them just <br/>\nlike with dominoes but by matching sounds to make a word. This has led <br/>\nus to the use of a dictionary. He made a match with BR and EAM. I had <br/>\nno idea it was a word. He found it immensely satisfying that there were <br/>\nthings that (1) I did not know and (2) you could find in this big fat <br/>\nbook. The mystery of the big fat book was revealed to him. He sometimes <br/>\njust flips through the dictionary, fanning the pages, just for the heck <br/>\nof it. It&#39;s very interesting to see the different kinds of sensory <br/>\nrelationships he has while their learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve announced this before but Evan is starting to <br/>\nread. He can actually take a Level 1 or 2 book, like from the &quot;I can <br/>\nread&quot; series or an Eric Carl book, and sit down and work his way <br/>\nthrough it. It&#39;s cool to hear him swirling the sounds in his mouth. <br/>\nSometimes he makes up the pronunciation or the word. It&#39;s such an <br/>\nawesome moment, when he works through the hurdle of a word. Just a few <br/>\nmonths ago he would get frustrated and stop. Now, he just tries <br/>\ndifferent things. He&#39;s getting less and less discouraged by not knowing <br/>\nhow to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Aidan will sometimes bring him a book or a Yugi-Oh card so his big <br/>\nbro will read it to him. They&#39;ll spend a good 20-30 minutes there <br/>\n&#39;reading&#39; sans adult.

Sometimes we&#39;ll throw them up in the air and <br/>\nmake as many real words as we can. Sometimes the kids like to put them <br/>\ntogether and make me say the words they make--they always have great fun <br/>\nwith that one.  Sometimes they like to just play around in the <br/>\nword-processing program on the computer. We also play lots of verbal word <br/>\ngames--end rhymes, alliteration, and word association. Dh is notorious for <br/>\nbeginning limericks that are so ridiculous, he couldn&#39;t possibly find the <br/>\nrhymes to finish them. That&#39;s always fun for the whole family!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that my kids are learning a lot about language without anything <br/>\n&quot;formal.&quot; Dh tried to talk my oldest into practicing her reading every day <br/>\nbecause &quot;that was how she would get better&quot;--he made a &quot;deal&quot; with her and <br/>\nthen left me to carry it out. For maybe three weeks, we sat down once a day <br/>\nor so when she felt like it (though she never really felt like it). There <br/>\nwere good days, and there were bad days. I dropped it pretty quickly, and <br/>\napologized to her for the whole ordeal. We talked about what might make <br/>\nreading fun and what kinds of things make it NOT fun. I suspect that if a <br/>\nchild really wants to learn to read by sounding things out, she will do <br/>\nthat and ask for help AS she needs it--when she&#39;s truly trying to read <br/>\nsomething that&#39;s important to her. Systematic lessons of any sort are not <br/>\nlikely to be successful unless the child undertakes them on her own, in my <br/>\nopinion and limited experience anyway. I guess you could always brainstorm <br/>\ndifferent ideas with your son, try them out and evaluate them as you go, <br/>\nbeing sure to listen if he says that they&#39;re not what he&#39;s wanting to do. I <br/>\nthink respect and following your child&#39;s lead is crucial, even if he <br/>\ndecides he wants to stop altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134426484,"authorName":"kazzoozz","from":"&quot;kazzoozz&quot; &lt;hksarmina@...&gt;","profile":"kazzoozz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"helping with reading","postDate":"1072603803","msgId":86961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJzbTdxcithdDkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":86964,"prevInTime":86960,"nextInTime":86962,"topicId":86961,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!
