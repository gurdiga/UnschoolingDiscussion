As a sort of happy <br/>\nside effect, a lot of the sensitivities went away also. This was a <br/>\nproblem coping in his life. Doing day to day activities and <br/>\nfunctioning as a human being. I think that&#39;s different than a <br/>\ndifficulty in how he&#39;s learning something. Although I can understand <br/>\nhow that difficulty would affect someone&#39;s outlook and sef image. And <br/>\nit&#39;s not that one is right and the other wrong. But I still wonder <br/>\nabout how much we, as a society, have created the idea of there being <br/>\nonly one way to learn and therefore everyone else is in need of help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She has been hypersensitive since one week old.
