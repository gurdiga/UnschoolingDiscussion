The environment might be lacking.<br/>\nThe parent might not know how to interact with the child, for instance an<br/>\nadult who was bookish might be less inclined to give her kinesthetic child<br/>\nthe freedom to use his body as much as he needs, not being able to perceive<br/>\nthat as learning. Child led is only a part of the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we define unschooling as how children *naturally* learn then we can&#39;t<br/>\nsay unschooling won&#39;t work because it&#39;s the same as saying children can&#39;t<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the stumbling blocks with unschooling and learning<br/>\ndisabilities is that there isn&#39;t a large enough community of unschoolers of<br/>\nLD kids. All the research is oriented towards kids who are expected to learn<br/>\nwhat is taught in school, with the goal of hopefully getting them into<br/>\nschool. The research supports that being taught through particular methods<br/>\nis what various LD kids need.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does that research apply to helping LD kids learn naturally? Helping<br/>\nthem become themselves rather than products to be fed to colleges or the<br/>\nworkforce?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we begin with the premise that kids don&#39;t need taught then the quest is<br/>\nto find ways to help kids learn what they want to learn, not learn what we<br/>\nthink they should learn in the time we think they should learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance there are ways of helping dyslexic people read. But if those<br/>\nways involve coercion, regardless of how authoritative someone is, then<br/>\nperhaps it&#39;s a good idea to look at the goals they are imposing on the<br/>\ndyslexic.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joseph Fuerst","from":"&quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gh3h99RWd2pR7-uwGI0qGbeXlWlSFIsUzAdn0kBerX_w4yq76ltYkorzZXHxITCoz78tmHTJlnT7yK9bPFcwJ7KFjMVwOmyd","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1640","postDate":"1007091795","msgId":29017,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWMxNzk1MSQyNzcyNTI0MCRlYTg5ODUwYUBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDcwNjEyOTQuNTM5Mi44NTMwNy5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29016,"nextInTopic":29018,"prevInTime":29016,"nextInTime":29018,"topicId":29016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Karin: I know what you mean about avoiding debates.
