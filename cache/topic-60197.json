I have 3 DD ages 9 1/2, 7 and 3.{Hi<br/>\nto anyone i know from other lists} I am {like Ren} trying to<br/>\nincorporate unschooling into our whole lives not just including it<br/>\nin what I see as their learning experiance. I dropped the<br/>\ndiscription of myself as being the &quot;teacher&quot; long ago. :)<br/>\nI have been listening and can only agree with the idea of things<br/>\nthat frustrate me in the end things would have been better if I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t gotten so worked up. I am trying but I am a work in<br/>\nprogress.:b <br/>\nI told the kids {after being encouraged from the list discussion as<br/>\nwell as general complaints from the hubbie about getting so worked<br/>\nup about their room and other sorts of things} that I am trying and<br/>\nI MAY fail {because I will have to retrain my thinking/reaction<br/>\npatterns} but I will keep on trying. Because it is the environment I<br/>\nwant for them. :)<br/>\n Anyway, my mom was a lifer in the PS system and even after<br/>\nretirement she still works as a sub. {as well as one of my sisters<br/>\nhas been a teacher for years now}. So growing up I saw the<br/>\n&quot;background&quot; most don&#39;t see of the public schools. Teachers {before<br/>\nthey had even met students} looking at the folders that follow the<br/>\nchild and talking about how much trouble or how &quot;good&quot; a child is.<br/>\nBTW I am not fond of any type of a label that follows children. A<br/>\ngood label only stereotypes a child just the same as a negative<br/>\nlabel. And though that child may have more opportunities then a<br/>\nchild labeled &quot;uncooperative&quot; it still can do harm due to<br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n My husband&#39;s grandmother was a secretary in the public school<br/>\nsystem till her retirement, way back when. To say the least, our<br/>\nfamilies weren&#39;t impressed, especially at first. Though now, the<br/>\ngrandmother&#39;s mind {I think} has changed after seeing that my oldest<br/>\ntaught herself to read very fluently without pressure. She now brags<br/>\non how she helps her when she visits and they go shopping or when<br/>\ndriving. &lt;G&gt; Others have less to say as we go. My mom doesn&#39;t<br/>\npressure so much anymore, she doesn&#39;t like to debate me. I am a bit<br/>\nhardheaded to say the least if I am protecting my freedom to raise<br/>\nour children our way. LOL<br/>\nAnyway about the Ritalin, before I was a solid homeschooler {as a<br/>\nnewbee without much experience and before we got our first computer~<br/>\noh about 4 or 5 years I forget LOL} my mom would say how she thought<br/>\nmy now middle DD needed it. NOT!! I already knew that was one of the<br/>\nthings they were not going to put in to their system. <br/>\nI have heard so many negative things from my mom about kids and such<br/>\nI think I was just afraid they might be next. I know I can never<br/>\nteach {or should i say that she won&#39;t be willing to learn} new<br/>\ntricks {aka her misconceptions won&#39;t completely fade about how kids<br/>\n&quot;should&quot; be taught} and have all but given up trying to &quot;prove&quot; our<br/>\nkids will be alright to others {mainly family both mine and my<br/>\nhusband&#39;s} They all have the same questions and comments over and<br/>\nover no matter they explanation I give. Basically it is so simple it<br/>\nis beyond them I suspect. And I just have the idea we will always be<br/>\nlooked upon as the black sheep. {my husband and I have always been<br/>\neven before we met} LOL ~ With the {{tisk tisk}} attitude for our<br/>\nkids. But hey, I can live with that. I live with them everyday and<br/>\nknow I am doing what&#39;s best for them.<br/>\nAnyway, no, I am not new to unschooling and yes,sometimes I am<br/>\nhesitant to use the term to describe our family. Mainly when I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to argue or defend who/what I am generally to someone who<br/>\nincorporates it in their whole lives, then I have thus far. IMHO<br/>\njust not worth it in the end. I like the idea and have been<br/>\ntranscending over more and more but I don&#39;t think one can truly<br/>\nchange overnight. We just are who we are. I can see it has made me<br/>\npersonally less judgemental overall. Or maybe it is just having more<br/>\nexperience as a homeschooler in general. Whatever it is, that has to<br/>\nbe a good thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nOk stepping down off my soapbox now! Sorry for the ramble.
