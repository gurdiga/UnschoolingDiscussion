Can you give us a brief how-to on it? Thanks ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\nOk :-)  Um yeah, he doesnt ever wear diapers.  But alot of &quot;westerners&quot; who do this do wear diapers, and just take them off when the baby needs to go. WHen he goes to the bathroom I hold him in a squat with his back against my chest over the toilet (or ground, or whatever..) but there are other positions too.  Basically, when he has to poop, he sort of grunts and looks at me- also I know that he has to go usually in the morning- so I try to be aware.  He also has times when he always has to pee- like right after naps.  When we are out side, he just pees in the grass. Inside my daughter and I go about our business and he does various things to let us know he needs to go.  He fusses, looks at us, pauses with a blank stare, crawls toward the bathroom, he even sometimes makes the ASL sign for toilet!- we just get a feeling. This is a learning experience and it seems each developmental phase brings its new aspect to EC (elimination communication). When we are out, he wears clothes and is usually in a sling- he won&#39;t pee on me, so even if I am in wild conversation- he will get my attention.- then I go to a bathroom, and he pees there.  In parks, I will pee him in a bush sometimes.  If I am going somewhere I offer to pee him- and he will push what he has out, or say with subtle body language that he doesnt have to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt night i sleep with a silky naked baby- (worth missing a pee- let me tell you!)  I hardly ever get wet- when he was younger, he would pee every couple hours, and now he holds it till early morning- he gets restless, I take him to the bathroom, he goes, and then we go back to bed. (there are many options to all of these things- this is just what I do)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he is walking and I got some tiny plastic potties- and put them around.  I don&#39;t think he knows what they are for yet, and I am not sure about them.  It feels so crazy- like if I was breast feeding in the fifties- who would I ask if i had a question?  But I have a e-list that gives lots of help and there is the fabulous book &quot;Diaper Free&quot; by Ingrid Bauer (an unschooler I believe!)-it just got accepted into LLL&#39;s book list- a very rigorous process. there is also another book, but I haven&#39;t read it yet-but plan to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this wacky thing because of the way my baby resonded when I tried it because my diapers were in the drier.  Just like Diane said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ll never forget the joy on my 7-month-old daughter&#39;s face <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the first time I let her go in the potty.
