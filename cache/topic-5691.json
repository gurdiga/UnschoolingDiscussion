A woman from the voc<br/>\n&gt; school was always there, and three parents  stayed each class (we<br/>\n&gt; rotated).  Parents were always allowed to stay, even if it wasn&#39;t their<br/>\n&gt; turn.  One parent was assigned to each of the three rooms: large motor<br/>\n&gt; skills and reading corner; art and science; dress-up and blocks/puzzles.<br/>\n&gt; We had circle time at the beginning for about 10 minutes.  Then the<br/>\n&gt; children were allowed to spend their time however they wished.  No child<br/>\n&gt; was ever forced to do anything (except circle and snack).  For instance,<br/>\n&gt; a child might do nothing but play with blocks week after week.  Then we<br/>\n&gt; had a snack and final circle time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I liked the fact that parents were always welcome and for the bulk of<br/>\n&gt; the class the kids got to choose what to do.  There were a few moms who<br/>\n&gt; came every week, and a few who couldn&#39;t wait until their turn to drop off<br/>\n&gt; and leave.  The kids varied in this way too.  Some were very clingy and<br/>\n&gt; others ignored their mom the minute they entered the class.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; During this year I had my second child and we moved to a different town.<br/>\n&gt; I did not do any preschool the following year because it didn&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; sense to hire a babysitter for the younger child in order to participate<br/>\n&gt; in a co-op with the first child.  And the first child was NOT interested<br/>\n&gt; in being dropped off somewhere without me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are preschool/unschool compatible?  I think it depends on your situation.<br/>\n&gt;  It may not be much different from any other &quot;class&quot; an unschooling child<br/>\n&gt; might take.  If I&#39;d had only one child, I may have continued in the co-op<br/>\n&gt; experience, as long as it was serving our needs.  Preschool is certainly<br/>\n&gt; not necessary!  Young children can learn everything they need hanging out<br/>\n&gt; at home just as well as at a preschool.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are some homeschoolers around here who do various co-op activities<br/>\n&gt; with their older children too.  A book called &quot;Playful Learning&quot; tells<br/>\n&gt; you how to set up a co-op preschool and is full of activities that are<br/>\n&gt; fun and educational.  (of course, we all know that everything is<br/>\n&gt; educational!)  Some families find that a small co-op (3-5 families)<br/>\n&gt; rotating in each others homes serves needs as well as a larger more<br/>\n&gt; formal program.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A side note: our next door neighbor&#39;s youngest child is same age as my<br/>\n&gt; oldest (they were 3 when we moved here).  I asked her one day if her<br/>\n&gt; daughter would be going to preschool next year.  She said &quot;No, and I am<br/>\n&gt; tired of people asking me that&quot;.  I told her I was glad to finally meet<br/>\n&gt; someone else who wasn&#39;t going to preschool, because we weren&#39;t either.<br/>\n&gt; It was during this time that I was meeting more homeschoolers.  Also, in<br/>\n&gt; my old town I was doing a lot of parenting things like everyone else bc I<br/>\n&gt; went with the flow and didn&#39;t really think about options.
