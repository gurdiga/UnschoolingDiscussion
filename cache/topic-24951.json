But those instances are less often than we tend to think.<br/>\nI have 5 kids (3 too little to be left alone at all) and a husband who<br/>\ntravels quite a bit.  Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.  When that<br/>\nhappens I try to make it as easy on the kids as possible.  Bring whatever<br/>\nthey are playing with along for the ride.  Stop by the library on the way<br/>\nback.  Turn the radio way up and roll the windows down.  Make sure we go on<br/>\nthe really hilly road with all the curves.  Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut mainly, I try to point out that I know the kids are inconvenienced, I<br/>\nknow it it a pain for them and I appreciate their sacrifice.  I also try to<br/>\nmake sure that when I suddenly have to schlep around with one of them (coach<br/>\ndidn&#39;t say what color baseball pants were needed until day before the 1st<br/>\ngame) I am not a crab about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24869,"nextTopicId":24950}}
