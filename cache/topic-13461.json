Take a deep<br/>\nbreath & relax.  Over the summer, just before school was to start, my mil<br/>\nhit me pretty hard that dd should be in school.  That really made me start<br/>\nquestioning what I was teaching her & her brothers.  Then DH took the kids,<br/>\nwhile I attended a seminar, to a historical museum twice & art museum once<br/>\nover a two day period.  Later he told me how impressed he was at their<br/>\nability to interact with the staff & tell him things about the exhibits<br/>\nbefore he mentioned them.  DS 4 told him a display was clay, they both<br/>\nmentioned the media used for different pictures.  They told him things about<br/>\nthe prehistoric animals as he was reading to himself.  They&#39;ve picked up so<br/>\nmuch just not exactly what their age level gets in ps.  He was very pleased<br/>\nwith the new way (unschooling) since he sees the kids having so much fun &<br/>\nlearning too.  For us that&#39;s right.  My inlaws haven&#39;t mentioned a word<br/>\nsince ps started without my kids.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Christine Masloske","from":"&quot;Christine Masloske&quot; &lt;cmas100@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"b5naKUC0gUXXbrXkB97QW88Ahp2KUJ76xlZnbdieQ9qnCwrvs5J0Jin2Pi9DYeyhCUINGpuFvATlMxymvDIYzZl3T7i3Eu-QpdJca3UZKy7m","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"postDate":"970080841","msgId":13461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMjl5ejViNktabWNLOHI2YmUwMDAwMTBkNkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13462,"prevInTime":13460,"nextInTime":13462,"topicId":13461,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Help!
