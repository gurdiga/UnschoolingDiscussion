It was not confusing at <br/>\nall and I found that it follows a logical progression of steps that make <br/>\nsense to us, at least.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I liked most was that it comes with books that use the words that you <br/>\nhave learned  and they give the kids a real feeling of accomplishment when <br/>\nthey read them.  We found that after the first level we didn&#39;t use the tapes <br/>\nanymore, that we didn&#39;t need them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the kind of program that you can follow very strictly or very loosely, <br/>\nas long as you don&#39;t move on until the child has mastered what he learned <br/>\nbefore.  We followed it loosely, as we are unschoolers at heart.  Other than <br/>\nHooked on Phonics we don&#39;t do the curriculum thing but we were able to use it <br/>\nin our own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend the program, although we bought ours 4 years ago, before the <br/>\ncomputer CD&#39;s were added.  I&#39;m not sure I would want to use the CD&#39;s but the <br/>\nworkbooks and story books are good. It&#39;s hard checking the program out from <br/>\nthe library, we tried that at first.  3 weeks isn&#39;t enough time to complete <br/>\none level, let alone the entire series. As far as the price goes it was worth <br/>\nif for us because I used for all three kids and I&#39;ll probably pass it on to <br/>\nanother family when we are finished with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin Stalte</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hooked on phonics?","postDate":"1029006589","msgId":40623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgxMDEyMDgzMC4wMWNjZWQ3MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PE9FMTA3cXhHR21OTjc5eGF2anIwMDAwNjhmYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40605,"nextInTopic":40639,"prevInTime":40622,"nextInTime":40624,"topicId":40555,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The ads make it look like it&#39;s fun for the kids.<br/>\nAnd it might be. But how much are you willing to spend on a fun way to do<br/>\nsomething that will happen naturally for free? How much would you have paid<br/>\nfor a fun program to help her to walk?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I ended up paying about $5. $20 for the 100 Easy Lessons which I<br/>\nsold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my daughter<br/>\nhad 0 interest.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on groundless<br/>\nfears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun and<br/>\nuseful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>\nnow. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>\nmajor road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in school<br/>\nthe fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>\nkids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>\nearly to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts gets<br/>\ncheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between an<br/>\nadult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7. (I&#39;d extend that to 13 for<br/>\nan unschooler but a later reader in school might be demoralized by the<br/>\nintervention and end up not liking to read or be convinced he can&#39;t. Sandra<br/>\nhas been collecting stories of later readers at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> I think the most important thing to realize in<br/>\nterms of calming fears is that a 13 yo new reader is *not* 7 years behind.<br/>\nThey&#39;ll be indistinguishable from their peers pretty quickly.) Learning<br/>\nthrough reading is *different* not better than learning by doing or learning<br/>\nby watching. Unless you&#39;re in school where learning is *only* avialble<br/>\nthrough reading and listening. Then otherwise endowed kids are severly<br/>\nhandicapped. That doesn&#39;t need to be true at home. We can adapt the<br/>\nenvironment to the kid rather than the kid to the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you still think you&#39;d like it, first check your library or through<br/>\ninterlibrary loan. Just ask your librarian to search. That should be free.<br/>\n(Or a nominal fee. I think one library in our system charges a quarter for<br/>\neach request.) Even if they don&#39;t have a regular system in place, most<br/>\nlibraries will call around and try to locate what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s some at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.half.com\">http://www.half.com</a> You&#39;ll need to read and ask questions<br/>\nof the sellers and perhaps search the internet to figure out what you&#39;re<br/>\ngetting since some of the sets are a few years old. (And to make sure the<br/>\nseller has listed his item under the correct heading!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.addall.com\">http://www.addall.com</a> it will search 20 or so used book sites<br/>\n(including half.com). It will be very helpful if you have the ISBN of the<br/>\none or ones you want since there&#39;s 15 of them and they&#39;re not listed by<br/>\npublication date. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe full price one does have a 60 day money back guarantee. Not on the s&h<br/>\nthough. But *if* you get to keep the National Geographics on CD that comes<br/>\nas a free gift, it might be worth it even if you never use it and just send<br/>\nit back! ;-) (It&#39;s *way* not worth it if you don&#39;t send it back.
