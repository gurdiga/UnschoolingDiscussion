I sent her an IM.  She wrote back to say that she wasn&#39;t supposed to be IMing and asked me not to tell her parents.  I agreed and asked her a few questions about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I thought she were in danger and her parents would help, I would tell them and/or provide what help I could.  In this case, it is conservative - but not horrible - parents doling out punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point I can do little more than shake my head and feel bad for a family where a daughter is sneaking to use the computer.  Maybe the opportunity will come up to discuss it with them in the future or in a general way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I write this, my 12 yod is in the same room at another computer, IMing and working on her myspace page.  Although *I* am disturbed by some of the ads on myspace, I am listed as a friend on my dd&#39;s site and can go there to check it out myself.  If I forbid it, I&#39;m sure she would figure out a way to do it anyway.  Because I&#39;ve allowed it, I am able to oversee her activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110133,"nextTopicId":110143}}
