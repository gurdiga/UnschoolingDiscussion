I&#39;m a homeschooling (past 4 yrs) mom of 2 girls (10 and 6). I&#39;m<br/>\na nervous homeschooler and I&#39;m constantly changing curriculum to see if<br/>\nit&#39;s better than the last.  As a result, my 10 yr. old is not on grade<br/>\nlevel and hates math.  My 6 yr. old was real interested in reading until<br/>\nI started teaching phonics, now she has no desire.  All I really want is<br/>\nfor them to love learning not hate it.  So that brought me here. I&#39;ve<br/>\nread all I could online and off about unschooling and though I&#39;m<br/>\nterrified I&#39;m going to do it.  My dh is part of my worries; he has to<br/>\nsee results.  He expects genuises since I homeschool and I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nhe&#39;ll have the patience to wait on Raven to read when she&#39;s 10.  I also<br/>\nhave a serious pet peeve.  Why is it when you homeschool people HAVE to<br/>\ntest your kids?  I went to a book store and a library yesterday.  My 10<br/>\nyr. old asked the lady how much a book was.  The woman said half the<br/>\nretail and asked Courtney what is half of $5 and Courtney stammered a<br/>\nlittle and said I don&#39;t know and then she told her.  At the library, my<br/>\n6 yr old was asked to say her alphabet and write her name.  (She was<br/>\ngetting a card so I understand the writing part).  Is it me being too<br/>\ndefensive?  Am I going to be able to handle unschooling with my fears?<br/>\nSorry so long, I just needed to get that out.<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nTerra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tracy Oldfield","from":"&quot;Tracy Oldfield&quot; &lt;tracy.oldfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QxbwmY6nXo3CB9zxK5KIMEm5xZFgJ3DXnuaRys2JCtjnGMxhmu7ftVdT-qRYu-SGnKzPHU_WA3TK2pf8tPswHoO9KSUkheizwu39ICr6iyZR14gypw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: introduction","postDate":"980995489","msgId":15649,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNzhDREExLjE1NDY1LjJDODFDOUNAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTMxLjA3MTg1Ny4tMTA2NTczLjAubWVnYXRlc0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15595,"nextInTopic":16807,"prevInTime":15648,"nextInTime":15650,"topicId":31,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve told my kids I m too tired/cross/fed-up/sad to deal with whatever atm and take myself to another room while I calm down.

But already on the second day, I am so excited to have found <br/>\nthis group that I don&#39;t even know where to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a work-at-home Mom of a very spirited three year old (May 27th) <br/>\nson, Sterling.  I have my own fast-paced business that requires long hours and <br/>\ndemands lots of attention, ironically very much like my son!  &lt;G&gt;  <br/>\nSo between the two, i&#39;m usually pretty crazy by the end of the day.  <br/>\nthen add in variable #3 - dh who retired from the air force but works <br/>\ntwo part-time jobs with unpredictable, irratic schedules.  and of <br/>\ncourse there&#39;s all those other projects - well, won&#39;t get into that <br/>\nright now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess in the back of my mind, I&#39;ve always known that if i want the <br/>\nbest thing for my son that i will have to home-school.  but i still <br/>\ncontinue to have the ongoing battle in my mind of why i should <br/>\nhome-school vs. why he should maybe go to school.  As he&#39;s getting <br/>\nolder, I&#39;ve begun to research a little more actively and suddenly <br/>\ncame to the realization that i already have been &quot;unschooling&quot; him <br/>\nsince he was an infant!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSterling has always been very advanced for his age, very alert, very <br/>\nactive and tireless.  He loves to learn, has a great imagination, <br/>\nasks questions that are well beyond his years and is constantly <br/>\nshocking me, has amazing logical reasoning and problem solving <br/>\nskills.  Most days, i have a hard time keeping up with him, mentally <br/>\nand physically.  so i have to seriously ask myself - &quot;just how lost <br/>\nwill a child like this be in a conventional school system?&quot;.  I know <br/>\nif i try to answer that question, it will only result in a lot of <br/>\nnegative criticism of the school system and that is not my intend <br/>\nhere.  I just can&#39;t see the school system as i know it being able to <br/>\nprovide the stimulation and learning environment that he not only <br/>\nneeds, but demands.  I don&#39;t ever want to put him into a situation <br/>\nthat will squash his love of learning, rather than nuture it or cause <br/>\nhim to be labeled as disruptive or distracted (or worse - ADD) <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s bored or does not conform to a standard, structured<br/>\nlearning style.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have only read posts here for two days, I sense that other <br/>\nparents here are making choices to home-school for very similiar <br/>\nreasons and not exclusively religious reasons.  With over 200 members <br/>\ni&#39;m sure many also choose for religious reasons but that the <br/>\ndiscussions here include a very wide spectrum of unschooling issues that <br/>\nparents face in pursuit of unschooling their children.  I can&#39;t tell <br/>\nyou how excited I am at the thought that i&#39;ve found a network of <br/>\npeople that can relate on this level of unschooling and actually feel <br/>\na big sigh of relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I have found a place to learn so much from others and hope <br/>\nthat i will be able to offer something of value in return.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for being out there!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"::she just is::","from":"&quot;::she just is::&quot; &lt;OmegaMolecule@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"P23CFjpfB6kWbmwmIrGPxDX1U-KYNXxKmSkTbTkeNzS3za77ZP1psXsnTSEXtBqaWPl9bnXWw7LyBCupPLVnDfTvBhsFyjTs8vYoCkrqQKw58o_TwUQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: introduction","postDate":"928246145","msgId":37,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMi4zNy45NTkyNjk3MzlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34,"nextInTopic":1703,"prevInTime":36,"nextInTime":38,"topicId":31,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Summer said: Oh, one last thing..

I&#39;m sixteen, I&#39;ve been unschooled since 4th grade with<br/>\noccasional unrewarding forays into parent-led or classroom education. <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Austin, Texas where there is an amazing secular homeschool group<br/>\ncalled Austin Area Homeschoolers that has a couple hundred families. I&#39;ve<br/>\nfound socialization to not be a problem at *all* -- not even &quot;less of a<br/>\nproblem than it&#39;s made out to be&quot;, no... Actually, it&#39;s one of the reasons why<br/>\nI love my life so much -- I don&#39;t think I would be as happy in a school social<br/>\nscene. Maybe my group is unique or whatever, but we have at least 40 active<br/>\nteens, and more total, plus I&#39;m friends with many of the younger kids and<br/>\nadults. There&#39;s &quot;even&quot; a fairly active, but not rushed, dating scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, on top of all that, I have teenage unschooled friends all over the<br/>\ncountry because of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s utopian, life-changing camp, Not Back To<br/>\nSchool Camp -- which just got it&#39;s own domain name, for any who are<br/>\ninterested... Camp is full this year, but Grace is also running a very<br/>\ninteresting sounding community camp -- http://www.nbtsc.org <br/>\n<br/>\nAside from my social life, which I could ramble on about for quite some time,<br/>\nI intern at a computer company called GirlGames Inc. that makes CD-Roms and<br/>\nwebsites for the pre-teen and teenage girl market (http://www.girlgames.com)<br/>\n-- I mostly write quizzes, fashion profiles, and the like, and I also do some<br/>\nweb design and graphic stuff there, as well as the occasional inane office<br/>\ntask. In any case, it&#39;s an awesome place to be three times a week, and I&#39;m<br/>\nlearning a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have my own webpage, which is currently at<br/>\nhttp://www.bga.com/~melissab, but will soon be going through an identity<br/>\ncrisis and moving to it&#39;s own domain name -- the old address hasn&#39;t been<br/>\nupdated since December because I&#39;ve been working on the new one.<br/>\n <br/>\nI take drama, mostly Shakespeare, and act as much as possible -- it&#39;s becoming<br/>\na true love. I&#39;m obsessed with the aformentioned author, Mr. Shakespeare, in<br/>\nparticular with Hamlet and it&#39;s character Ophelia -- I have a website<br/>\ndedicated to her, too, and often find myself &quot;dashing off&quot; pages of text to<br/>\nthe requests for Ophelia paper ideas or research help that flood my mailbox. <br/>\n<br/>\nI write. A lot. Mostly poetry, some songs, a few stories. I&#39;ve had a couple<br/>\npoems appear in the London based Quaker newsletter &quot;The Friend&quot;, although I&#39;m<br/>\nagnostic and don&#39;t go to a Quaker church, the editor wanted to publish me..<br/>\n:-).. I&#39;ve also performed some of them, and a song, at the talent show at<br/>\ncamp, and I&#39;ve had a few letters to the editor published in local papers. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy west-african drumming lessons ended a few months ago, much to my dismay,<br/>\nbut I do drum a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI play soccer, and skate. I used to ride horses but the stable I was riding<br/>\n(and working at) lost it&#39;s best instructor and my beloved horse, so I&#39;m taking<br/>\na break and hoping my friend Kate will start a novice vaulting (gymnastics on<br/>\nhorseback) team soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI take a lot of pictures, although my latest role of people camping out for<br/>\nStar Wars hasn&#39;t been developed yet. Art is an obsession I gleamed from my<br/>\nmother, who&#39;s a freelance artist. From my dad I got a love of pop culture, and<br/>\nI&#39;ll admit that I get pretty caught up in that whole movies-and-celebs thing.<br/>\nAlso from my dad, a love of politics -- we lived in Washington for 18 months<br/>\nwhile he worked for the President, and I am currently scrambling to convince<br/>\nmy friends that they MUST register and vote for Al Gore in 2000... I love<br/>\ndebating politics, and other issues... <br/>\n<br/>\nLike animal rights. I&#39;m a vegetarian, and have been for a long time before<br/>\nanyone else in my family was (my parents converted after my dad&#39;s heart attack<br/>\nin Feb., and have both become totally trim and healthy to the hospital&#39;s<br/>\nshock.) A lot of my friends disagree with me about AR stuff, I have some<br/>\npretty radical views -- but I love defending them. The same goes for youth<br/>\nrights, a natural outgrowth of unschooling in a way -- I hold the view that<br/>\nthe voting age should be lowered to at the very least to include teenagers who<br/>\npay income tax, and I believe in the loosening of laws that allow parents to<br/>\nbasically do whatever they want to their kids, including forcing them to work<br/>\n& hand over their paychecks to mom and dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m straight-edge, although not by culture. I simply use it as a catch-all<br/>\nterm for the fact that I don&#39;t eat meat, smoke, drink, or do illegal drugs,<br/>\nand never plan to. Unlike the above, this isn&#39;t a belief that I think most<br/>\npeople &quot;should&quot; adopt -- it&#39;s simply a choice I&#39;ve made for myself.. Actually,<br/>\nI&#39;m for the legalization of some drugs, and the fact that I never plan to<br/>\ndrink surprises a lot of people... Including, I think, my parents. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently took a research paper writing class from a homeschool group parent<br/>\nand professor -- it was really fun and interesting. I wrote my paper on...<br/>\n*are you ready for this?*... hip-hop & Shakespeare -- kind of testing the idea<br/>\nof merging fields or ideas that seem opposing or just radically different. It<br/>\nexplored the benefits of using hip-hop to teach Shakespeare in the classroom,<br/>\nstuff like that. Like I said, the class was a very interesting experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I feel as if I&#39;ve gone on long enough... I just really enjoy sharing<br/>\nmy incredibly positive experiences as an unschooler with other people who are<br/>\nlike-minded (at least about one thing!) <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve enjoyed the discussions thus far, and I hope I didn&#39;t bore you TOO much. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one last thing..
