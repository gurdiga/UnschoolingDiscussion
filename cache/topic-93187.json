Really lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...  She was a good mom to my sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister talked about this last  week, when I delivered my mom&#39;s ashes to <br/>\nher.  She had told me on the phone that when I was at her house, she wanted me <br/>\nto tell her what I thought about why I had been hurt by my mom and she didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to have been.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t really want to talk to her about it too much.  I planned a couple of <br/>\nshort statements to get out of it, and that worked fairly well.  What I <br/>\nmainly did was to remind her that 20-some years ago, when my dad died, she had been <br/>\ntelling me bad things about her relationship with him (nothing horrid, just <br/>\nfrustrations and resentments) and I told her that he wasn&#39;t that way with me, <br/>\nand that it was really okay (and inevitable) that her relationship with him was <br/>\nhers, and separate from mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with friendships.  I have some friends other friends don&#39;t <br/>\nlike.  I see why.  I just don&#39;t hang out with them at the same time.  My husband <br/>\nhas some friends I don&#39;t have any fun around, but I do see why they enjoy being <br/>\ntogether, so I just subtly arrange to be elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy relationships with my three kids are different, in the ways that they&#39;re <br/>\ndifferent people, and in the ways I was different when we settled on patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s dad is the greatest grandparent my kids have.  He&#39;s much lighter and <br/>\nlooser with the kids than he was with his kids.    Keith&#39;s mom isn&#39;t light or <br/>\nloose with anyone, and that&#39;s okay.  We just work around her inflexibility, <br/>\nand we&#39;re all civil and as fakey-nice as we can be.  (Two weeks, we&#39;ll be <br/>\nthere...  preparing my smiles and slightly-forceful comebacks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told my sister and her newish husband who doesn&#39;t know us very well and <br/>\nhardly knew my mom (only in recent years when she was a mess) just a couple of <br/>\nsymbolic stories and summarized with them not needing to know more, just to <br/>\nknow that I had hurts Irene didn&#39;t need to know about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Irene told me something I had never known.

I&#39;ve known grandparents, <br/>\naunts/uncles, even neighbors, who could play with great abandon, as <br/>\nlong as it was with somebody else&#39;s kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as daycare goes, it has become an expensive and extremely <br/>\nlimited option, for those who must work outside the home. I was the <br/>\nyoungest of 3 children and my mom babysat a number friends/neighbors, <br/>\nover the years. It was like having younger sibilings for me. Finding <br/>\nresponsible people to provide this type of support is difficult these <br/>\ndays. In our city, full-day Public pre-school is now available for 3 <br/>\nyear olds, as a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that there are a large number of families that have parents <br/>\nthat have overextended themselves. We live in New Jersey and I am <br/>\nconstantly amazed by the amount of farmland here that has been plowed <br/>\nunder and replaced by $700,000 houses. Who has families large enough <br/>\nto fill these places? How many hours do both parents have to work to <br/>\npay those kind of mortgages? Whose watching the kids? -schools. <br/>\nClearly, that type of life was not your choice (or mine).<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the fact that your parents can be &quot;Grand&quot;. It is good to see <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t seem to resent their new found abilities. Just make <br/>\nsure that your homeschooling efforts are not being undermined <br/>\nby &quot;schoolies&quot;. I try not to mention the &quot;UN&quot;-part too much when I <br/>\ndiscuss our schooling with those types of family members. It tends to <br/>\nmake them doubt their own traditional approach to education and they <br/>\nget defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd just turned 4 and unschooling suits her just fine. She will say <br/>\nshe want to go to school and do homework, but I think it comes from <br/>\nwatching PBS Kids shows, where everybody GOES to school.

There is NO WAY, however I feel about these people, that I could deny my <br/>\nson the wonderful relationship he has with them. I had to bite the bullet at <br/>\nfirst, but now that he is older and can spend time alone with them, it is much <br/>\neasier. And no matter how tough it might have been on me in the beginning, it <br/>\nis/was SO worth it. He asks to call them, to e-mail them, to visit them. Last <br/>\nweek, he spent the night 2 different nights at my parents, along with our <br/>\nregular Sunday visit, and when we got home, he was sad because he missed them!! <br/>\nHow&#39;s that for unconditional love?! I&#39;m very happy for him.
