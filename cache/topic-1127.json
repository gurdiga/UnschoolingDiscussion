(These are homeschoolers, not <br/>\nunschoolers, but they are still often freaked by tests.)  I encourage them <br/>\n(and their parents) to think of testing as a separate skill rather than a <br/>\nreflection of intelligence or even how much they know about a subject.  <br/>\nAlthough we all know that tests are a poor indicator of learning, etc. the <br/>\nrest of the world hasn&#39;t figured this out and everyone will have to take <br/>\ntests sometime.  I tell my students I would rather they learn their test <br/>\ntaking skills early on before they get to tests that really matter -- like <br/>\nthe SAT or ACT.  Or even a driver&#39;s test.  I think this has a couple of <br/>\nadvantages.  First, it allows them to examine their test-taking skills, which <br/>\nare completely separate from how well they know the material being tested on. <br/>\n Second, if they don&#39;t do well they just think, &quot;I don&#39;t take tests well&quot; <br/>\nrather than &quot;I can&#39;t do math&quot; or even &quot;I&#39;m not smart enough.&quot;  Also, if they <br/>\napproach the test just thinking of it as a test rather than an assessment of <br/>\nthem in some larger way, they&#39;re usually calmer and I find calmness is the <br/>\nfirst step to testing well.<br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1129,"nextTopicId":1132}}
