(And boy #3, who<br/>\nrefuses to be left behind, picked up reading at age<br/>\nfour) So that&#39;s three boys who learned to read on<br/>\ntheir own. It&#39;s a great reminder to me...because it<br/>\nwas the one area where I never &quot;persuaded&quot; (pushed,<br/>\ncoerced, cajoled, etc LOL) and they did just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nGina&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil.

She was away from it<br/>\nfor some time and we noticed she was beginning to<br/>\nstruggle again.  So we found another therapist<br/>\nnear us and started her back on weekly visits for<br/>\na &quot;tune-up&quot;  The Dr. said kids who hit puberty<br/>\noften have changes (other than the hormones!!&lt;G&gt;)<br/>\nand a few visits will get them right back on<br/>\ntrack!  It sure worked for us!!  I am so plased<br/>\nwith the results.  We were given weekly homework<br/>\nand also suggestions for how to stay &quot;tuned up&quot;<br/>\nafter we stopped going due to a move.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned the cost--by all means, talk<br/>\nabout options with the Dr.  Often there are ways<br/>\nto make it affordable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen in CA<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
