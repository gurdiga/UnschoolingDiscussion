Somehow it mattered in their game.

I remembered someone here or in <br/>\nsome unschooling discussion asking (today? yesterday?) whether anyone used <br/>\nencyclopedias anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I pulled out M, P and S (in case it was under planets or solar system) and <br/>\nstarted looking, but also was saying it was going to be WAY variable and <br/>\ndepend on the moment, because sometimes Mars is nowhere NEAR Earth.  Under Mars <br/>\nthere was a graphic of when Mars had been closest, since the late 1960&#39;s, and it <br/>\nshowed the pattern, like where Earth was in orbit when Mars came by.  That <br/>\nwas cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in all that, Ryan said they had been frustrated one time that the <br/>\nencyclopedia didn&#39;t have what they wanted.  &quot;This encyclopedia?&quot;  &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they&#39;ve used it before.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned finding &quot;cargo cults&quot; and I didn&#39;t believe him.
