I&#39;m just not good at letting others do for me or take care of me.  I do find myself overwhelmed at times.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI like the idea of taking turns. I&#39;ll have to try that.  It&#39;s not that the boys don&#39;t like to help, it&#39;s finding the patience in myself to let them help. <br/>\n <br/>\nA big step for me -- one I didn&#39;t figure out until my oldest was too old to really correct myself easily -- was learning to let them do a job like a child (incomplete at first).  I wasn&#39;t very good at showing him how to do a job, or at having the patience to work thru the learning process.  It was just easier to pick up the toys, than to wait for him to complete the job.  I was single and working full-time, it seemed there was just never enough time to wait while he struggled to tie his shoes.  Over time, my resentment would build that I was doing too much.<br/>\n <br/>\nI know I created the problem by not allowing time for him to learn and just doing it myself.  As he got older, I got better at allowing him the time to master things.  Now when Dan wants to load the washer and add the soap, or use the broom, I lift him and help him do it. When Andy wants to make his own frozen pizza or mop the kitchen floor, I say sure and tell him to ask for help if he needs it.  Then, I was more likely to brush aside all attempts to help as being too time-consuming.  Then, it seemed all I ever said was &#39;it&#39;s easier to just do it myself.&#39;  <br/>\n <br/>\nNow is really so much better.   <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I don&#39;t really feel it would have been better if I&#39;d had my way at her expense, but I find that I still carry resentment for being given what I consider too many household chores and being treated like a live-in babysitter.  I guess it would have been nice if I&#39;d occasionally been allowed to just be a kid, even if it came at her expense. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll admit that in my early parenting I probably asked too little for myself, let the pendulum swing too far to the kid-indulgent side.  I was determined to show her how badly I&#39;d been treated by rejecting all her ways.  And I&#39;m not really good at making time to take care of my needs.  That maybe because my needs didn&#39;t matter as a child for a very long time, so I never learned to put myself first where it counts.  Anytime I demand more from me, I feel like I&#39;m doing just what was done to me.    <br/>\n <br/>\n***<br/>\nMaybe by &quot;good job&quot; you mean mainstream high school-to-college and nothing else is &quot;a good job.&quot;  But all humans do better if they feel they&#39;re ratcheting toward &quot;good&quot; than if they feel they&#39;ve just given up and good isn&#39;t accessible to them. If it takes adjusting the definition of &quot;good,&quot; that&#39;s fine. But <br/>\nrejecting it isn&#39;t healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to say it&#39;s a good idea to reject the idea of doing a &#39;good job&#39; or to lose hope of doing a good job.  Just that it&#39;s helpful to figure out what your standards and expectations for a &#39;good job&#39; are.  Traditionally, &#39;good job&#39; has meant raising children who go straight from high school to college, marry, have a family and never embarrass or disappoint their parents; who manage to anticipate and avoid every possible mistake so that no one has to explain how that happened and where the parents &#39;failed.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nI consider a good job to be helping my kids learn to be kind, respectful, loving, helpful, how to express thanks and compassion, be honest and live a life with integrity and self-respect.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but the point is I don&#39;t care if my kids never go to college, or work at a job others consider beneath them.  It won&#39;t embarrass me if they drop out of college (even repeatedly) or divorce, or never marry or make choices  no one else understands, so long as they aren&#39;t leaving human devastation in their wake.  I will never tell them that they&#39;re too smart to make mistakes. That was my Mom&#39;s mantra with me as a child -- drove me nuts!       <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I didn&#39;t say, is that I&#39;ve reframed things so that I removed shoulds from my own thought. I&#39;m just not able to use that word, it&#39;s loaded for me. Instead I define things -- being kind, responsible, thoughtful, etc -- as things I need to do, or even want to do to make life more pleasant for everyone (myself included), rather than things I &#39;should&#39; do. And I&#39;m trying to watch out for how I frame things I think the boys &#39;should&#39; do or want to do.  I&#39;ve found that when I hear myself thinking should, it&#39;s never about something I really feel is important or necessary, but about things others expect of me that I&#39;d never presume to expect of them, or that I&#39;m confident they already know and don&#39;t need me nagging them about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, the kids still at home are much more helpful around the house, quicker to say thanks or I&#39;m sorry, and the like, than my oldest was in the days when we &#39;required&#39; more of him.  Gary has commented several times how often the boys say thank you or please, with no prompting from us.  His Mom is the self-appointed expert on when thank you is necessary and just how effusive it must be.  He grew up hearing lots of shoulds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to pay more attention to the unspoken messages I&#39;m hearing as shoulds. I continue to feel like I&#39;m somehow a disappointment to my parents (and my inlaws), in that they don&#39;t understand my choices and they think I&#39;m making mistakes I&#39;ll come to regret.  My Mom especially seems to feel a need to protect me from myself by offering unsolicited advice -- advice that always makes me feel like she thinks I just don&#39;t yet see that I&#39;m wrong, but will someday. Yanno, that I&#39;m too smart for this. &lt;g&gt; One the one hand I&#39;d like to please them -- on the other, I take some secret pleasure in being contrary. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading this I see that her moving back has me more out of sorts than I realized. Probably explains where my head has been the last week or so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

If it takes adjusting the definition of &quot;good,&quot; that&#39;s fine. But <br/>\nrejecting it isn&#39;t healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy unschooling is largely based around an easier life, emotionally and <br/>\nphysically--not just for my kids, but for me too.   Having accepting, loving, <br/>\nattentive, patient, humorous interactions does make up for some lacks in my <br/>\nchildhood, but if my childhood had a lack and my children don&#39;t have that lack, that <br/>\nmakes my life better emotionally.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I feel better and they feel better, I&#39;m for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"The play with mommy part was digest 4817","postDate":"1091444251","msgId":97185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PEJEMzJGQjAzLjU2MTglaGVhdGhlcmV0dGVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":97180,"nextInTopic":97186,"prevInTime":97184,"nextInTime":97186,"topicId":97169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Your","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1338180399\">&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s the play with mommy part - sigh.

It can just drive me up the wall to sit down for 10 minutes of Barbies or a game of trouble. So...sometimes I just grit my teeth and do it...but that&#39;s rare. Sometimes I sit down and let my daughter absolutely direct what I do in the play so there&#39;s not much effort for me but she still has a ball. Mostly though I sit down with some thread and old socks and sew up Barbie or My Little Pony clothes while she plays. We talk, we&#39;re close, she&#39;s happy. Sometimes when they want you to play with them you can actually do something beside them and they&#39;re happy. While they&#39;re colouring, read but pay attention to what they&#39;re doing. You can play on your terms too. I&#39;m doing a jigsaw right now and invite Catherine to help me and we talk as we put it together. <br/>\n      And what about switching your day around? If the morning is easier, play with them then. Use the afternoon for their baths or a long movie where you make them snacks and a &#39;bed&#39; on the floor and you can doze off on the sofa and rest up while they watch TV. I used to think that last tactic was irresponsible but it got me off their back at the worst part of the day for me and I got rested up so I was a more cheerful mom for the rest of the day.

I have been<br/>\nreading<br/>\n&gt; here and nodding and absorbing and thinking, I can do that!  Then one<br/>\nthing<br/>\n&gt; goes wrong and the next thing you know I&#39;m hiding under the basements<br/>\nstairs<br/>\n&gt; until I can be calm enough to be in the same room with my kids and feel<br/>\n&gt; safe.  A lot of this is trying not to repeat patterns. So I am going to<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; to figure out more specifically what it is I am looking for.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ok, so I went and read a bunch of the links you sent.  Right now I feel<br/>\nlike<br/>\n&gt; having a great big pity party all by myself.  I want to run and hide.  I<br/>\n&gt; feel like the biggest failure in the world.  Now that I have that behind<br/>\nme,<br/>\n&gt; I need to figure out what to do instead.  Since I had my second child my<br/>\n&gt; parenting goals have been very simple.  My very basic goal was to not hit<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; kids. The others all seem like easy to me like providing organic food,<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; using non toxic stuff in my house, read to them, make sure they get to<br/>\ncall<br/>\n&gt; their grandmas often enough to have a clue who they are.<br/>\n&gt; That just isn&#39;t enough anymore.  It seems like one of the biggest<br/>\nobstacles<br/>\n&gt; for me is play.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seems like so many people say to me, just get down and play with them.<br/>\n&gt; Follow their lead.  It sounds so easy, and often they are looking me in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; eye like, why is that so hard?  To me, it&#39;s like instant panic.  I want to<br/>\n&gt; pull up a corner of the carpet and get under it and hide!  Obviously I am<br/>\n&gt; working with some serious leftovers that are effecting my parenting.  I am<br/>\n&gt; working really hard on it.  However, I still have these awesome kids that<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; love and desperately want to give a better start.  What do I do in the<br/>\n&gt; meantime to cope?  I don&#39;t want to give up.  Like I said before, the<br/>\n&gt; afternoon is the hardest, so I make my plans accordingly - no changes<br/>\nduring<br/>\n&gt; those times to stress me more.  Ideally we can either be home then, or<br/>\n&gt; somewhere where we can stay put that is low key or contained enough that I<br/>\n&gt; am not worried about chasing Crispin down every 5 seconds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel like I am whining.  I don&#39;t want to be whining, but I am just<br/>\n&gt; drowning.  I am surrounded by awesome attachment parenting mamas who make<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; look easy.  And they spend all day with their kids!  My husband has mine a<br/>\n&gt; lot of the time.  I feel so hopeless about being able to keep them home.<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not willing to give up but I am just aching and sinking.  I am treating my<br/>\n&gt; kids very much like I was treated minus the hitting.  It is killing me.  I<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t know how to interact with them like I think I am supposed to,<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; at least want to.  I was a barely seen *never* heard kid without siblings<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; neighborhood kids that were &#39;acceptable&#39; playmates.  My kids have tons of<br/>\n&gt; friends to play with but we have to drive to them - which we do regularly.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s the play with mommy part - sigh.  I just never interacted with anyone<br/>\n&gt; that way.  It&#39;s almost like I get scared right away at the thought.  I<br/>\n&gt; literally sink in my chair and pull my shirt over my head sometimes.  Has<br/>\n&gt; anyone else remotely felt like this?  I feel so guilty like my kids are<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; going to hate me for screwing them up.  I wanted to be a cool mom that my<br/>\n&gt; kids really like.  My kids *do* like me, but the nasty little voice in my<br/>\n&gt; head says it&#39;s just because they don&#39;t know any different.  Eventually<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; will figure out what they are missing like I did.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t have to be so hard!!!  I&#39;ve got books, websites, people.  The<br/>\n&gt; answer isn&#39;t there, it&#39;s in me.

However, I have embraced that I am &quot;trying my best and <br/>\nthat is the best I can do&quot;. When I don&#39;t do something I want I don&#39;t <br/>\nbeat myself down mentally. I regroup and realize I can do it <br/>\ndifferently without the FEAR that I am failing. This constant FEAR is <br/>\na result of the painful consequences in my childhood that I was <br/>\nunable to escape then. These consequences are gone now, choose your <br/>\npriorities. For some, the best that they can do is not to hit their <br/>\nchildren. For others, the children can thrive on so much more when a <br/>\nparent isn&#39;t trying to overcome so much themselves. Be gentle with <br/>\nyourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can one play when one is on the verge of failing, IN HER OWN <br/>\nMIND? You can not do it all perfectly. I believe you said that you <br/>\ncan do it all, but not very well. That is one choice. Another is to <br/>\nshare the load.
