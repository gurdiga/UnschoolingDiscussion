She currently plans to <br/>\ntransfer to a University of California and major in creative writing and <br/>\nminor in ceramics. She has a LOT of unschooled friends and many are in their <br/>\n20&#39;s. In fact, a big group of them are all meeting up in Oregon next week for <br/>\nQuo Vadis -- a camp for unschoolers who are &quot;moving on&quot; into adulthood -- <br/>\nmost are in their 20&#39;s. Quo Vadis means somethng like &quot;Where to now?&quot; This is <br/>\ntheir first year - it is composed of former Not-Back-to-School Camp kids who <br/>\nare getting older and want to support each other as they go off into their <br/>\ndifferent directions -- college, career, or whatever. My daughter will <br/>\nprobably be the youngest. She&#39;s traveling for several weeks -- including the <br/>\nweek at Quo Vadis - visiting her friends in Northern California, Oregon, and <br/>\nWashington. She made all the arrangements herself - including trains, busses, <br/>\nplanes, and shuttles -- and who is picking her up and where she is staying, <br/>\netc.  This is VERY common for unschooling kids - to take time to travel <br/>\nwhenever possible. I think it is a wonderful way for them to really exercise <br/>\ntheir competence and ability to handle themselves, independently. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam (nervous about her &quot;baby&quot; being out traveling on her own, but very <br/>\nconfident in her ability to manage it, too)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Are there any Adult unschoolers?","postDate":"1022789723","msgId":37918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNC4xMjIyOWQ4Yy4yYTI3ZTI1YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37907,"nextInTopic":37927,"prevInTime":37917,"nextInTime":37919,"topicId":37888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/30/02 11:58:02 AM, dawnwells@cox.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1304079858\">In a message dated 5/30/02 11:58:02 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawnwells@...\">dawnwells@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Didn&#39;t Sandra&#39;s Conference say that she will have a soap star that was <br/>\nbrought up unschooled? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s Kelly&#39;s conference!<br/>\n(But I&#39;ll be there. &lt;g&gt;)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112723896,"authorName":"AprilWells","from":"AprilWells &lt;dawnwells@...&gt;","profile":"dawnwellsttc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Are there any Adult unschoolers?","postDate":"1022781412","msgId":37907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDRjY2N0U0LjcwNDAzQGNveC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGFkNW5oYytiM3VwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37905,"nextInTopic":37918,"prevInTime":37906,"nextInTime":37908,"topicId":37888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Didn t Sandra s Conference say that she will have a soap star that was brought up unschooled?
