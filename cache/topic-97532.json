I do not think this concept would make sense to a young child. I will certainly share my beliefs with them as they get older and we begin discussing more issues as this one. We do go to a spiritual center where they are surrounded by metaphysical beliefs, too, so I suspect that at a point they will begin asking questions themselves.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;how does she explain <br/>\n&gt;the knowledge or theory of that?

He <br/>\ntalks about people choosing their own lives, and when asked about <br/>\npeople who have horrifying lives, his response is (paraphrasing)that <br/>\nsouls might pick a horrifying human life for much the same reason a <br/>\nperson might choose to go see a horror movie.  The movie&#39;s not really <br/>\nreal, and it&#39;s kind of an enjoyable experience to be scared when it&#39;s <br/>\nnot really real.  So, according to his theory, a soul might choose to <br/>\nlive through a horrifying life just for the experience, to learn <br/>\nsomething new, and then when he dies and goes back to spirit form, he <br/>\nwill choose a different life where he can learn and experience yet <br/>\nanother new thing.  The soul knows the horrifying human life is not <br/>\nreal, even though during the &quot;movie&quot; of life it might be so caught up <br/>\nin the &quot;story&quot; that it forgets that it&#39;s not real.  When the soul <br/>\ndies, he can look back on his &quot;life-movie&quot; and say, &quot; Wow, that was <br/>\nan interesting horror movie, not let&#39;s pick a different kind of life <br/>\nto experience.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWild book.

Does this make more sense?<br/>\n <br/>\nRemaining objective and neutral about other people&#39;s decisions, beliefs and actions seems crucial to unschooling. After re-reading my post here, I see that I need work harder and take my desire to be truly non-judgmental to include my children! Duh! Seems obvious, but I guess for me it&#39;s easier to refrain from judging outsiders, whose decisions don&#39;t really affect you in any way, than making judgments on my own kid&#39;s choices. <br/>\n <br/>\nI realize now that it&#39;s letting go of that old belief (of mine) that our children and their behaviors are a reflection of our parenting, and therefore my worth and self esteem come into question...&quot;am I a *good* mom if my kid wears no shoes to the store?&quot; &quot;am I a *good* mom if.....(fill in the blank). This is a belief that I learned growing up, and it no longer serves me or my current goals. Therefore, I am in the process of writing out new affirmations/beliefs that will support my current vision of how I choose to be with my children. This process I know will help. Thanks to you all, greatly, for allowing me to process through all of this here. Writing things out, and being pushed with tough questions is so very valuable for me. I&#39;ll get there ;)<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] colors, waldorf, too weird to quote","postDate":"1092075382","msgId":97577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZiLjMwNWI3OTEwLjJlNDkxOTc2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":97575,"nextInTopic":97600,"prevInTime":97576,"nextInTime":97578,"topicId":97532,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" That s fine, but it won t get them closer to unschooling.

In the early grades painting is non-representative; <br/>\nchildren are immersed in the experience of the different colors and learn the <br/>\nquality of each. Beginning in fourth grade, painting lessons are often related <br/>\nto the subject being taught in the main lesson. Clay modelling, veil painting, <br/>\ndrawing with charcoal and pastels and other art forms are also a part of art <br/>\nlessons through the middle grades. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Form Drawing<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Form drawing is taught in grades one through five as part of the main lesson <br/>\nor in a period of its own. Forms of various kinds are drawn, beginning with <br/>\nstraight and curved lines in first grade. This is the foundation for the child <br/>\nlearning to print and write. By third grade the forms become quite complicated <br/>\nand help to develop the child&#39;s spatial orientation and sense of balance and <br/>\nproportion. In fifth grade, with this experience behind them, the children <br/>\npractice free hand geometry. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jlc.net/~faiman/waldorf/handbook_curriculum.html#art\">http://www.jlc.net/~faiman/waldorf/handbook_curriculum.html#art</a><br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97811,"nextTopicId":97913}}
