I really believe the need for that <br/>\n&gt; structure <br/>\n&gt; is the parent&#39;s need, not the child&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kathryn,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe that your belief is based on your experience (as most <br/>\n&gt; beliefs are.) I also believe that not everyone experiences the same <br/>\n&gt; response to unschooling, therefore your statement cannot apply to <br/>\n&gt; everyone. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have had personal experience with a child who does need an <br/>\n&gt; external structure.  Unschooling was my desire - I (the parent)did <br/>\n&gt; not have the need for structure.  Unschooling was a disaster for my <br/>\n&gt; daughter.  It made her edgy and upset.  She hated it.  She created <br/>\n&gt; her own school plan and it was very harsh and demanding.  I had to <br/>\n&gt; step in before she had a nervous breakdown.  She also hates open <br/>\n&gt; ended questions.  She is a perfectionist and she has always been <br/>\n&gt; hard on herself.  She has wonderful loving parents who have not done <br/>\n&gt; anything to cause her to be this way.  It is just the way she has <br/>\n&gt; always been.  She spilled a glass of milk when she was 2 and became <br/>\n&gt; quite hysterical.  People watching probably erroneously assumed that <br/>\n&gt; her parents had been overly harsh in the past when she spilled <br/>\n&gt; things. The truth is that she had never accidently spilled anything <br/>\n&gt; before.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She is now 14 and studying Classical Literature.  She is reading and <br/>\n&gt; enjoying things that would put me to sleep.  She did fine from <br/>\n&gt; September until January.  When she started showing signs of stress, <br/>\n&gt; I stepped in and asked her to take some time off.  She refused <br/>\n&gt; saying that she needed to finish what she had scheduled.  I found <br/>\n&gt; some light, fun reading choices and put those on her schedule <br/>\n&gt; instead.  She thanked me and hugged me with tears in her eyes.  I <br/>\n&gt; have spent most of her homeschooling years running similar <br/>\n&gt; interferences.  I also spend a great deal of time telling her how <br/>\n&gt; wonderful she is as a human being and that studying hard does not <br/>\n&gt; make me love her more.  I know that some will read what I have <br/>\n&gt; written and choose not to believe me.  I can&#39;t help that; all I can <br/>\n&gt; say is &quot;you have not walked in my shoes.&quot;  Please do not judge what <br/>\n&gt; you have not experienced. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alaura<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Alaura, from my perspective, you illustrated my point. I said &quot;externally <br/>\ndemanded structure&quot;  -- a parent or teacher requiring specific learning at a <br/>\nspecific time. You did not give her the highly structured stuff when she was <br/>\na little kid, OR, I assume, require the Classical Literature. SHE did. She <br/>\nwanted structure, and she found it. As an aware parent, when you saw her <br/>\ndriving herself nuts, you gently helped her find ways to continue doing what <br/>\nSHE wanted, in a form that was likely to help her feel better. (I am assuming <br/>\nthat you didn&#39;t tell her she HAD to do that.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy twelve year old son is teaching himself High School Chemistry with CD-ROMS <br/>\nhe asked me to buy him. He loves it, because he&#39;s fascinated. This is very <br/>\nstructured learning, which he has NOT been into until now. Is he unschooling? <br/>\nYup--I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass whether he masters chemistry at 12 (or ever, <br/>\nreally). <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other extreme, I give you -- Me. I am a Director of Religious <br/>\nEducation at a Unitarian Universalist church, and keep toying with becoming a <br/>\nminister. So far, I have decided not to, because it would require my going to <br/>\nGrad School for a Masters of Divinity. Going to a Hippy College and <br/>\nunschooling have made me resent the idea of traditional grad school type <br/>\nlearning, so for now it doesn&#39;t seem worth it. If  could learn what I need <br/>\nand want to learn in an unstructured way, I&#39;d do it. I don&#39;t want to sit and <br/>\nlisten to lectures and write meaningless, intellectual papers at this point, <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32434,"nextTopicId":25640}}
