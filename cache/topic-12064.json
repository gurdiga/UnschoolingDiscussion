We frequently and publicly <br/>\nsay that we believe all people are learning all the time with or without <br/>\ndirect instruction.  Privately, we debate how much or little we should <br/>\nintervene (when one of our children does not recognize the alphabet, for <br/>\ninstance.)  Usually we decide it&#39;s way to early to be concerned and we just <br/>\nheighten our awareness for opportunity.  We like the idea of classes and <br/>\ninstruction by others (i.e, karate instruction or a special arts program) but <br/>\nonly if our son wants to participate.  As parents we love learning all kinds <br/>\nof new things so we&#39;re frequently aware of opportunities because of our <br/>\ninterests.  Finally, there are times we do get more focused and structured <br/>\nbut I fear it is due to our insecurity rather than a need on the part of the <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest is 6 and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about mathematics and <br/>\nwhat our approach might be.  Imposing worksheets and algorithms will never <br/>\never work IMO with our 6 yr old.  I also have a bias against arithmetic and <br/>\nmathematics being learned out of context of any practical application.  <br/>\nHowever, I am skeptical that much mathematical grounding is occurring with <br/>\nthe sporadic questions about price and time and height etc.  I think my <br/>\napproach will be to lay low and hang back for now but keep my eyes open for a <br/>\n(math related) project we can fall in love with.  Then we&#39;ll take that as far <br/>\nas we care to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/18/00 8:50:32 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; one more abstract thought...\u000e i wonder how many of you <br/>\n have an unschooling \u000f<br/>\n approach that reflects the active learning, conscious <br/>\n seeking out of info to \u000f<br/>\n answer ideas that come up-- constantly diligent and <br/>\n aware of opportunities to \u000f<br/>\n educate and absorb etc, verses the learning is <br/>\n happening whether you TRY or \u000f<br/>\n not method?\u000e i see these as some distinctions in <br/>\n unschoolers approaches...\u000f<br/>\n \u000f<br/>\n erin\u000f &gt;&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12008,"nextTopicId":12071}}
