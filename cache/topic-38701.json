Not forcing the kids<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be equated with letting their needs trample ours or others.<br/>\nLetting kids have their way doesn&#39;t help them learn to resolve conflicts.<br/>\nImposing our way on them doesn&#39;t help either and, in fact, teaches them that<br/>\nbeing in a position to impose your way on those who are less powerful is a<br/>\nuseful technique of getting your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you resolve a conflict of interest with another adult?

Unless<br/>\nyou&#39;re using cooperation in the way many adults do with children as in &quot;You<br/>\nneed to cooperate,&quot; which means, in other words, &quot;You need to stop trying to<br/>\ndo what you want and do what I want you to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAny statement that includes &quot;must&quot; should set off alarm bells. Perhaps some<br/>\nwill turn out true -- as in we must have oxygen to survive! But our society<br/>\nhas unconsciously filled us with oodles of them so &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;need tos&quot; are well worth examining. (For example: Children must go to<br/>\nschool to learn. We must have 3 meals a day. Children must have regular<br/>\nbedtimes. Parents must present a consistent and united front.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(And I&#39;ve found the people who frequent here and the Unschooling.com message<br/>\nboard (and the old AOL HSing forum) like Sandra and PamS and PamH among<br/>\nothers have been invaluable in helping me examine those! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of these parenting discussions isn&#39;t that conventional methods<br/>\ndon&#39;t work but that they aren&#39;t the only choice available. So for people to<br/>\njump into a discussion and insist that their methods are valid and they&#39;re<br/>\ngoing to stick by them is to miss the point. The purpose of the discussion<br/>\n*isn&#39;t* to force people to think a particular way. The purpose is to<br/>\n*provide an opportunity* -- by asking questions and saying &quot;that&#39;s not your<br/>\nonly choice&quot; -- for people to question themselves on why they&#39;ve made the<br/>\nchoices they have. Some people, because of that opportunity, may come to<br/>\nrealize that for them the pros aren&#39;t worth the price they&#39;ve been paying<br/>\nand that by rethinking what&#39;s important to them and examining their<br/>\npriorities they may increase family joy. Through the discussions some people<br/>\nget the opportunity to realize that letting go of something that seemed so<br/>\nimportant is a small price to pay to get something greater that they hadn&#39;t<br/>\nrealized existed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people may feel their level of joy the rest of the time is more than<br/>\nsufficient to outweigh the moments of nonjoy or the results are worth the<br/>\nnegatives of the process so they&#39;re going to continue doing what they&#39;re<br/>\ndoing. That&#39;s fine. The discussion *isn&#39;t* intended to make them change what<br/>\nthey&#39;re doing so the effect of jumping in to declare that they aren&#39;t going<br/>\nto change is in effect trying to stop an opportunity for *others* to grow<br/>\nand change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want to change, don&#39;t change! :-) Just skip the discussion and<br/>\nlet it continue for those who are finding some benefit in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no agenda to make everyone here toe a particular parenting line.<br/>\nYes, I know, it may seem that way since conventional parenting does get<br/>\nquestioned everytime it comes up. But that&#39;s because conventional (coercive)<br/>\nparenting *isn&#39;t* unschooling. Which *doesn&#39;t* mean conventional parenters<br/>\naren&#39;t unschoolers! People can be unschoolers and parent conventionally.<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing in the philosophy that says unschooling needs to apply to<br/>\nparenting. But that means discussing conventional parenting *isn&#39;t*<br/>\ndiscussing unschooling any more than discussing math programs is<br/>\nunschooling. And there *is* an agenda to keep the discussion on unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some people *do* extend unschooling into parenting so discussing how to<br/>\nunschool parenting *is* discussing unschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean people<br/>\ncan&#39;t question it! For example, &quot;How will they learn to be polite unless we<br/>\nmake them?&quot; or any other seeming impossibility. It doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t<br/>\ndisagree that it&#39;s possible. (But it&#39;s hard to make that argument valid<br/>\nsince there are parents and kids here who are living it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what it boils down to is that for some parenting is separate from<br/>\nunschooling so for those people discussing parenting is *not* discussing<br/>\nunschooling. (There are *plenty* of places where people can get conventional<br/>\nparenting and housekeeping advice based on conventional American<br/>\npriorities.) Or unschooling *does* encompass parenting, In which case<br/>\nsomeone will face a huge uphill battle trying to defend conventional<br/>\nparenting as unschooling. Conventional parenting techniques don&#39;t apply the<br/>\nconcepts of child-led learning (or any other definition of unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for some people discussing parenting in an unschooling forum is an<br/>\nopportunity to discuss a way of parenting that for some is a natural<br/>\noutgrowth of letting children learn naturally. Forcing children to do chores<br/>\nis not a natural outgrowth of unschooling so discussing that isn&#39;t<br/>\ndiscussing unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t too many places where people have the opportunity to reexamine<br/>\ntheir priorities from a &quot;children as fellow and competent human beings&quot;<br/>\n(though not the best way to phrase it) point of view. So if people want to<br/>\ncontinue with whatever conventional practices work for them, then they<br/>\nshould. But it denies others the opportunity to reexamine their priorities<br/>\nand explore extending unschooling into parenting by insisting that something<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t unschooling should be acknowledged as valid.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82877497,"authorName":"Cheryl Duke","from":"&quot;Cheryl Duke&quot; &lt;cheryl@...&gt;","profile":"windysnowdancer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: family responsibility","postDate":"1025537856","msgId":38829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDgwMWMyMjExNSQzYTE2ZmM5MCQwMjAxYThjMEBhbHBoYXdvbGY2OT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE5Zi40ODhmZTIzLjJhNTBhZjJhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38813,"nextInTopic":38830,"prevInTime":38828,"nextInTime":38830,"topicId":38701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No one is being told to go ... natural ...

I used to be a James <br/>\n  Dobson style parent and now I am at the point where I don&#39;t make my <br/>\n  kids do anything they don&#39;t want to do.  However, where I draw the <br/>\n  line is that I don&#39;t let them take advantage of me either.  For <br/>\n  example, if I am going to keep my house in a somewhat decent order, I <br/>\n  CAN&#39;T run around cleaning up after them all the time.  I have tried <br/>\n  and I literally cannot do it all.  So, each person in my family, <br/>\n  regardless of whether they are a child or an adult, must clean up <br/>\n  after themselves.  I am there to love and nourish my children, but I <br/>\n  won&#39;t be their maid for them unless it&#39;s something that they <br/>\n  physically can&#39;t do for themselves.  So, if they are going to <br/>\n  bake,they may bake as much as they want but I will not clean up their <br/>\n  mess.  And I won&#39;t allow them to force me to live in a house that is <br/>\n  filthy.  They must clean up.  If they don&#39;t clean up, then they can&#39;t <br/>\n  bake next time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy for us to allow anyone, <br/>\n  even our children, to take advantage of us.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The same thing goes for bedtime.  They have rights, but they have to <br/>\n  learn to balance those rights by not taking advantage of someone <br/>\n  else.  It is unsafe for my 3 and 5 year olds to be in a house by <br/>\n  themselves unsupervised.  Therefore, they may stay up as long as I am <br/>\n  up.  If I&#39;m up until 3 am and they want to be up with me, that&#39;s <br/>\n  fine.  However, if I am going to bed at 11 they must go to bed then <br/>\n  too.  It wouldn&#39;t be safe for them to be up without me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; on 6/27/02 1:41 PM, LLindsey at llindsey@w... wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; it is very true that the children have no choice in their <br/>\n  position as the<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; younger, smaller least powerful members of a family.. but this is <br/>\n  the the way<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; it is.

In our house that means <br/>\nget out of day time clothes and into what ever you sleep in or don&#39;t sleep <br/>\nin. It means reading quietly, working on a puzzle, watching a program, <br/>\nplaying with something by ones self in their own room until you get tired and <br/>\ndecide on your own to actually go to bed. The reason we *choose* (for lack of <br/>\na better word) this particular time is when Darin gets home from work (12 to <br/>\n15 hour days) he doesn&#39;t take any time for himself, he wants to spend time <br/>\nwith the kids, and by 10 he is ready for his own alone time, which means <br/>\ncomputer or playstation, and the kids are ready to be apart from each other. <br/>\nAlso at 10 I like to watch reruns of Law and Order on A&E, and that is my <br/>\nalone time. After 11 - 11:30 it is *our* time together. So far this has <br/>\nworked out, but there is no hard fast rule either. No one is being told to go <br/>\nto bed, everyone gets some down time before bed, and everyone chooses when <br/>\nhe/she wants to actually go to sleep. (I think it is better for their natural <br/>\nbody patterns as well.) The only person who goes by an alarm is Darin because <br/>\nhe goes out to work. I don&#39;t care if I go to bed before my kids, because they <br/>\nknow if they really need something they can get me or Darin. We had a family <br/>\nbed up until Jack was about 4 and he decided he wanted his own bed and Moly <br/>\nstarted kicking too much. I still wake up some mornings with one or both of <br/>\nthem in our bed. Moly is a late to bed, early to rise person. She doesn&#39;t, at <br/>\nthis time, require as much sleep as me. Why should I make her go to bed just <br/>\nbecause it suits me? Jack is usually asleep by 10:30, he falls asleep fast <br/>\nand hard. He will literally play until he is asleep. Then he gets up sometime <br/>\naround 3am and plays some more, gets something to eat (P.B. and honey) and <br/>\ngoes to the bathroom. He never wakes us up, he is very quiet and the only <br/>\nreason I know he does this is that I suffer from insomnia. Then he goes back <br/>\nto bed (not his own, most times it is ours or the couch) and sleeps until he <br/>\ngets up which varies and I never know if he is going to be up at 7 or at 10. <br/>\nI have no clue why he gets up in the middle of the night. I think he may have <br/>\nintense dreams like me and gets up to work through them, but I don&#39;t know. <br/>\nAll I know is that this *system* works for us, it gives us all time to <br/>\ndecompress, be apart (which I think is very important) and pursue our own <br/>\ninterests totally uninterrupted. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":82877497,"authorName":"Cheryl Duke","from":"&quot;Cheryl Duke&quot; &lt;cheryl@...&gt;","profile":"windysnowdancer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: family responsibility","postDate":"1025458642","msgId":38802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzMwMWMyMjA1YyRjYWY3YzIzMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhbHBoYXdvbGY2OT4=","referencesHeader":"PGFmbmM2aysxcWE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38797,"nextInTopic":38809,"prevInTime":38801,"nextInTime":38803,"topicId":38701,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... take advantage of us.

I used to be a James <br/>\nDobson style parent and now I am at the point where I don&#39;t make my <br/>\nkids do anything they don&#39;t want to do.  However, where I draw the <br/>\nline is that I don&#39;t let them take advantage of me either.  For <br/>\nexample, if I am going to keep my house in a somewhat decent order, I <br/>\nCAN&#39;T run around cleaning up after them all the time.  I have tried <br/>\nand I literally cannot do it all.  So, each person in my family, <br/>\nregardless of whether they are a child or an adult, must clean up <br/>\nafter themselves.  I am there to love and nourish my children, but I <br/>\nwon&#39;t be their maid for them unless it&#39;s something that they <br/>\nphysically can&#39;t do for themselves.  So, if they are going to <br/>\nbake,they may bake as much as they want but I will not clean up their <br/>\nmess.  And I won&#39;t allow them to force me to live in a house that is <br/>\nfilthy.  They must clean up.  If they don&#39;t clean up, then they can&#39;t <br/>\nbake next time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy for us to allow anyone, <br/>\neven our children, to take advantage of us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing goes for bedtime.  They have rights, but they have to <br/>\nlearn to balance those rights by not taking advantage of someone <br/>\nelse.  It is unsafe for my 3 and 5 year olds to be in a house by <br/>\nthemselves unsupervised.  Therefore, they may stay up as long as I am <br/>\nup.  If I&#39;m up until 3 am and they want to be up with me, that&#39;s <br/>\nfine.  However, if I am going to bed at 11 they must go to bed then <br/>\ntoo.  It wouldn&#39;t be safe for them to be up without me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; on 6/27/02 1:41 PM, LLindsey at llindsey@w... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is very true that the children have no choice in their <br/>\nposition as the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; younger, smaller least powerful members of a family.. but this is <br/>\nthe the way<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is.

IN<br/>\n  &gt; THEORY<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you look at it from the child&#39;s point of view, or change it around to a<br/>\n  new sitaution, it becomes clearer why the children don&#39;t see the<br/>\n  reasonableness of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Adults get to choose where to live and pretty much dictate how money gets<br/>\n  spent (or at least can veto any purchase). We may think we&#39;re pretty<br/>\n  generous about kid choices but if we turn it around it is very controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Imagine your husband deciding on his own where you would live, which house<br/>\n  to buy (to primarily suit his needs but taking into account any needs of<br/>\n  yours that he deemed worthy) and how the decor would look. He would listen<br/>\n  to your suggestions but they&#39;d only be taken into consideration if they<br/>\n  didn&#39;t interfere with his needs. Say he&#39;s a big sports fan (and you&#39;re not)<br/>\n  and he decided the house would be a shrine to his favorite team.  If you had<br/>\n  a special non-sports related picture he might suggest it could hang on the<br/>\n  refrigerator or in a corner of your room so it didn&#39;t interfer with his<br/>\n  decorating scheme.<br/>\n<br/>\n  All meals would conform to his idea of good with maybe a little concession<br/>\n  to your tastes (potato chips instead of pretzels). You might get to go to<br/>\n  your favorite restaurant once in a while but your order couldn&#39;t be too far<br/>\n  off what he thought you should eat and couldn&#39;t be too expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you wanted to buy something outside your regular allowance -- like a book<br/>\n  or something -- you&#39;d need to convince him that it was worthy of purchase<br/>\n  and you&#39;d need to later demonstrate that you were using it enough for it to<br/>\n  have been worthy of purchase or you&#39;d hear about it the next time you wanted<br/>\n  something.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you wanted to go somewhere or get something at the store, it would have o<br/>\n  wait until it was convenient for your husband to take you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a way, ending up in a family is not unlike going to school. There&#39;s no<br/>\n  choice about being born/going to school (at least not for most kids!) or<br/>\n  what family/school you&#39;ll end up with. The adults are supposedly thinking of<br/>\n  everything the kids need and supplying them with it and expecting the kids<br/>\n  to appreciate it. The kids don&#39;t, of course, because what the adults are<br/>\n  really supplying is what the *adults* want the kids to have, not what the<br/>\n  kids want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We may have decided what we wanted for our kids was a big backyard. Then it<br/>\n  seems reasonable since the kids live there and should appreciate it, they<br/>\n  should mow it when they&#39;re old enough. But as much as the kids might enjoy<br/>\n  the backyard, they didn&#39;t choose it and knowing what they&#39;d need to do to<br/>\n  &quot;pay&quot; for it (for the rest of their childhoods) they might have chosen --<br/>\n  had they been able to be informed and been allowed the choice -- to buy a<br/>\n  house with a miniscule yard next to a park. So why should they appreciate<br/>\n  it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s sort of like getting showered by nothing but expensive Barbies and<br/>\n  parephernalia at every gift giving occasion when you&#39;ve told people that<br/>\n  what you really love is dinosaurs. Should you think it&#39;s wonderful and<br/>\n  appreciate the &quot;thoughtfulness&quot; of the gift givers? Or are the &quot;gifts&quot;<br/>\n  really forms of control?<br/>\n<br/>\n  But if we act as though our children are partners without demanding that<br/>\n  they act as partners then they will be partners because it&#39;s more joy<br/>\n  inspiring to be invited with open arms with no strings attached than it is<br/>\n  to be required to uphold your membership in something you never asked to<br/>\n  join.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
