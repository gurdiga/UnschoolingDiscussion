I think the boogers are a side <br/>\nbenefit!!<br/>\nI read in the book Skin, the Criticial Importance of Touching( I am not <br/>\npositive of title)<br/>\nthat it is believed that the reason people pick noses is that when nursing <br/>\nthe nose is against the breast and stimulated, so the picking and poking of the <br/>\nnose is comforting and an attempt at creating that breasty feeling. Makes <br/>\nsense to me and sounds kind of nice when faced with a nose picker. <br/>\nWhen I worked in daycare we just gently suggested they might need a kleenex <br/>\nor to find a quiet place. It seemed to work. The little guffers seem to just <br/>\nforget they are with people and get right down to a good pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy in BC, now has a kid that is a picker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74844,"nextTopicId":74574}}
