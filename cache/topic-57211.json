I&#39;m pretty adamant<br/>\nthat my kids know how to swim. We&#39;re around water all the time, and I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s an important thing to know. I&#39;ve told them that either I<br/>\nwill teach them or they can take lessons. My son just opted to drop<br/>\nlessons and have me continue teaching him. As soon as they&#39;re<br/>\nproficient swimmers, we&#39;ll stop. But I wasn&#39;t willing to wait until<br/>\nwhatever age they thought it would be good to learn to swim. I guess<br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve pulled a 7 year old boy from a river where he would&#39;ve<br/>\ndrowned, I&#39;ve got strong feelings on this one. Everything else I&#39;m<br/>\nwilling to be patient with.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I almost drowned when I was 7 and we live in FL and we have a pool. But <br/>\nI was adamant about unschooling swimming too!! Before this house we went <br/>\nswimming often at my SIL&#39;s. Tara had learned on her own when she was about <br/>\n5-6. My SIL (another one) that works in the school system was telling me <br/>\nabout swim lessons that were great. I listened and left it go at that. When <br/>\nwe moved into this house with a pool, she started up again. I asked Joseph <br/>\nand Sierra if they wanted to go. I explained what it was and then they said <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to do that. THAT went over big with the SIL.  LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they wore their swimmies and we left them alone as far as teaching <br/>\nanything in the pool. We moved in here in August of 2000 and by Oct. they <br/>\nwere swimming without the swimmies. Sometimes when they were tired they <br/>\nwould put them back on. The following summer they became fish.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s 3 and 1 to go. Alyssa is 2 and loves the pool and wears her <br/>\nswimmies. We have a pool safety fence and the kids are well aware of what to <br/>\ndo if anyone gets into trouble in the pool. The children swim much better <br/>\nthan I do. Eventually Alyssa will also.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.
