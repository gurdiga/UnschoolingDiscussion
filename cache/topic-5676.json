If I <br/>\ndon&#39;t allow myself to get distracted my others&#39; opinions, I have a good, <br/>\nclear sense of what I believe in and the way I want to live.  Unschooling is <br/>\nan important part of my life and ideals.  But I can be insecure at times and <br/>\nif I am around certain people at those times, I find myself doubting what I <br/>\nbelieve.  As the years go by, I find myself more sure and I bolster that by <br/>\nthinking, reading, and writing about the reasons for my beliefs.  Lists like <br/>\nthis are also a major source of support.  <br/>\n     I don&#39;t like to be afraid to listen to others&#39; opinions because I <br/>\nbelieve we are often challenged and enriched by them.  So I try to find the <br/>\nbalance between being open to other views, willing to discuss things, and <br/>\ndoing what I need to do to stay connected to my own true voice.  Best wishes <br/>\nwith your unschooling adventures...<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in Calif.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"A. Yates","from":"&quot;A.

I am an unschooling mom of three<br/>\ndaughters, ages 9, 7 and 5. It has been a rough month for us<br/>\nas we have wondered whether our choice to home and then <br/>\nunschool our kids is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do. I realized<br/>\nthat I was taking too many polls of the people around me,<br/>\ntrying to get their approval so that I could feel okay<br/>\nabout what we were doing. It wasn&#39;t enough that my husband<br/>\nand I felt confident about it, I needed everyone to pat me o<br/>\non the head and say what a good job I was doing and what<br/>\na wonderful mother I was. I have realized over the past week<br/>\nthat there are places where you will be able to get support<br/>\nin these endeavors and places where that support will never<br/>\nbe forthcoming. Just as I had to accept that, I have had to<br/>\nwrestle with my own doubts and fears on a daily basis. Its<br/>\nnot the most fun, but at least I can feel good that I am<br/>\nshowing my kids that we can reevaluate and renegotiate<br/>\nlife whenever we want to, making mistakes can be a way of<br/>\nfinding out both what we like and what needs to be let go of.<br/>\nI appreciate the input on this list so much. Thanks. Teresa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5649,"nextTopicId":5691}}
