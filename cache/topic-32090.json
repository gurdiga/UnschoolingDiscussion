I&#39;m having so many problems at these Yahoo sites!  My <br/>\nlast post didn&#39;t take, so let&#39;s try it again!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJOYLYN: thank you for the nursing clothes/ slings site.  <br/>\nI&#39;m 6 mos. pg <br/>\nwith #2.<br/>\n<br/>\nJOYCE: Thanks for pointing me to the message boards.  <br/>\nSometimes I find <br/>\nit tedious to point and click back and forth on these <br/>\ntypes of pages, <br/>\nbut it IS very informative.  Thank you for reminding me <br/>\nthose are there. <br/>\n<br/>\nINTRODUCTION: My cyber-nick is TATE, and I live in <br/>\nNorthern IN (almost <br/>\nto MICH) with my DH of 4.5 years and our 2.5 year old <br/>\nboy, &quot;Z.&quot;  I <br/>\nfrequent another mommy-board where there are several <br/>\nhomeschoolers, and <br/>\nhave gotten to know more and more about this phenomenon <br/>\n(both un- and <br/>\ncurriculum users...).  It is really starting to interest <br/>\nme as of late, <br/>\neven though my child is 4.5 years away from mandatory <br/>\nschooling.  Kindy <br/>\nis not mandatory in IND.  He would be nearly 7 (b-day is <br/>\n9-22) when he <br/>\nwould start a traditional 1st grade class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I can or will homeschool.  And then I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know if I <br/>\nwill &quot;un-school&quot; or choose a curriculum.  I&#39;m just <br/>\nstarting to check it <br/>\nall out now.  So please allow me to lurk a while and <br/>\nlearn all I can <br/>\nfrom those who have btdt (or are there doing it!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my life BC, I taught high school English for 4 years <br/>\nin Indianapolis.  <br/>\nThat is where I first learned a disdain for the public <br/>\nschool system.  <br/>\nMy DH seems open to the idea of H-schooling, but my mom <br/>\nand other family <br/>\nmembers seem closed-minded.  So that is something I will <br/>\nhave to think <br/>\nabout when/ if I decide to do this.  I know I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\ncare what others <br/>\nthink, but it&#39;s hard!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that&#39;s enough about me.  Back into lurk-mode.<br/>\nTATE<br/>\n=o)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32081,"nextTopicId":32095}}
