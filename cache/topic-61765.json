Her love affair started when she <br/>\nabout two. She used to watch an English claymation thing called Wallace and <br/>\nGrommet. Her enjoyment of Looney Tunes, especially the WWII vintage, Tom <br/>\nand Jerry etc. have provided some amazing conversations around history, <br/>\nmusic, lifestyles, politics, society, fashion and much more. We also have a <br/>\nwonderful time Sunday evenings reading the comics together. It&#39;s been an <br/>\ninteresting exercise for me to try to explain current political commentary <br/>\nor some grownup concepts to her. She totally amazes me when we read Family <br/>\nCircus and she *gets* all the stuff that the parents are going through. She <br/>\ncan see their perspective, which just amazes me.<br/>\nI also like having all this humor in our house.<br/>\nCathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;***How about the Bugs Bunny, Barber of Seville one, ***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dylan can recognize Rossini and Wagner almost instantly anywhere he hears<br/>\nthem and that started with Bugs Bunny.
