Although she&#39;s rather easy to cry, she&#39;s a very outgoing, friendly, easy happy funny kid. I have never ever had any squabbles regarding her and any of the friends she plays with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s between her and her brother and sister. As nice as she is to all her friends, she&#39;s that mean to her brother and sister at times. Sometimes to the point where I am shocked at what she does. Just downright mean, both verbally and physically. Her brother is 13 months older than her and her sister will be 4 next month.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has never been punished for her behaviors as far as taking anything away or restricting her. She lies about what she does when she is mean. She can be rather sneaky about it too. For awhile it seemed like it was her brother and sister, but it&#39;s mostly her. I&#39;ve seen it. Her brother is to the point where he cries over her being mean to him and the little one. He&#39;s frustrated because no matter what we say, she doesn&#39;t stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s to the point where the other day, she actually was mean to her brother in front of a group of kids and they told me what happened when Joseph ended up in tears again. She denied it all. I&#39;ve talked until I just don&#39;t know what to say anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained what her behavior will entail later on. I&#39;ve tried to understand the whys and I get no where. I&#39;ve read the books about how to talk to your kids and try all those neat little ways to get them to open up and I still get I don&#39;t knows from her when I talk to her about such things. And always a denial. It&#39;s to the point where she can&#39;t be believed. And I&#39;ve explained that part of it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m stumped.
