I didnt say anything to the &quot;converted <br/>\nunschooler&quot;  I just listened in amazement as she described how much easier her <br/>\nlife was now that she could &quot;blame&quot; all the work on the video personality from <br/>\nthe BJU tapes she uses.   I was in shock thinking her kids had been unschooled <br/>\nfor 12 yrs and now they LOVED BJU curriuculum.   It all became clear when Pam <br/>\nexplained it to me after the lady had left.  I was like.. HUH??, WHAT?? she <br/>\nmade up her own school at home curriuclum and she called it unschooling???    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe met a &quot;new&quot; lady today who has teen that she homeschools.  I know she is <br/>\ntrying to get her footing and decide which way to go with it.  I had emailed <br/>\nher the unschooling.com link and she said she really enjoyed reading the web <br/>\nsite.   Today she said she is concerned about how her son will &quot;get&quot; Biology next <br/>\nyear ( he is 15).  All the dissecting frogs and stuff.   Folks gave several <br/>\nsuggestions for online stuff and local classes.  I was thinking.. &quot;can&#39;t he <br/>\njust catch a frog and cut it up if he wants to?&quot;  LOL.. but I didn&#39;t say that.    <br/>\n We are going to be meeting her and her daughter again soon, she and Anna <br/>\nmight hit it off.  Anna said today that she was very nice and she would like to <br/>\ndo something with them again.    I will kind of just casually talk about <br/>\nunschooling, sort of like witnessing to a non-believer.. LOL.. Lead by example and <br/>\nall of that good stuff.  If she sees that Anna is doing great, maybe she will <br/>\nbe convinced that unschooling DOES work<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"genant2@aol.com","from":"genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] play group","postDate":"1055281246","msgId":73560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMTJiYjNmMjguMmMxN2FhNWVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73562,"prevInTime":73559,"nextInTime":73561,"topicId":73560,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was thinking it was someone here that was talking about maybe starting a reading group of unschoolers but was unsure because everyone has their own ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-944628904\">I was thinking it was someone here that was talking about maybe starting a <br/>\nreading group of unschoolers but was unsure because everyone has their own <br/>\ndefinition of unschooling.  I met one today that takes the cake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt our homeschooling play group I showed up early and one other Mom, new to <br/>\nthe group, showed up early.  We were chatting and she was talking about their <br/>\nhomeschooling journey.  She had said they have been homeschooling for 13 years <br/>\nnow.  For the first 12 years she had done it all herself.  Decided what they <br/>\nwere going to study for history, math, science and for how long.  What books <br/>\nthey were going to read and what reports would be due for English etc etc, <br/>\ncreated her own curriculum and was getting tired of the endless hours of writing up <br/>\nthis curriculum. Then she found the wonders of Bob Jones University stuff and <br/>\nbought the boxed curriculum this year and she and the kids love it. It went <br/>\non. We talked about other stuff too.  I didn&#39;t mention that I was an <br/>\nunschooler, hate to scare people off.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the rest of the group showed up and we were all chatting.  Teresa and a <br/>\nfew others were talking about taking their children out of public school.  <br/>\nAnd happened to mention unschooling in passing.  This new Mom pipes up &quot;I <br/>\nunschooled for 12 years then I discovered BJU and my kids love it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could see Teresa&#39;s eyes bug out (hi Teresa).

I had no idea that she would say that as she never <br/>\nmentioned unschooling in our earlier conversation.  Too funny<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people have a definition of unschooling that is real relaxed.  This Mom <br/>\nwas so far away from unschooling I don&#39;t think you could get any further away. <br/>\n LOL.  So if I were going to start a &quot;book club&quot; I would definitely make sure <br/>\neveryone is in at least the same chapter if not all on the same page.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just my interesting day.
