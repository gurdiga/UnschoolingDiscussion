Let it go knowing he&#39;ll learn something <br/>\nfrom the process anyway. It isn&#39;t the end of the world if he gives up and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do the math course and, therefore, doesn&#39;t get to do the other thing <br/>\nand regrets it later. He&#39;ll learn from that, too, about how NOT perservering <br/>\nhas consequences. Understanding that,  he&#39;ll eventually be able to cope with <br/>\nhaving to &quot;play the game&quot; if it is necessary and he wants something enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - another good skill is to figure out another way to &quot;play the game.&quot; Is <br/>\nthere really no other way to get what he wants? Try brainstorming, together, <br/>\nall the possible ways - include even the most farfetched silly unlikely <br/>\nideas. Then look at them and see if any can be turned into something that <br/>\nmight be actually workable. Thinking outside the box is hard - we often <br/>\nreject ideas that seem outlandish - but are really doable if we just have <br/>\nenough willingness to try something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could do some brainstorming here, too, if you tell us what it is he wants <br/>\nto do and why the math course is required.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need Help!","postDate":"1018457899","msgId":34362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwLjI1NjdkZDFiLjI5ZTVjOTJiQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34352,"nextInTopic":34364,"prevInTime":34361,"nextInTime":34363,"topicId":34352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/10/02 10:02:19 AM, corina_crane@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1487780639\">In a message dated 4/10/02 10:02:19 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:corina_crane@...\">corina_crane@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; If he quits, he&#39;ll regrett it later.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he stays, he&#39;ll regret it now.
