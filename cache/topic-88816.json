He","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1031404548\">I have learned so much from this list!  It really challenges me and <br/>\nmakes me think and I could use some input here!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have concerns about my 2nd child.  He will be 10 years old in May <br/>\nand he has autism.  I&#39;ve been unschooling him since July.  Before <br/>\nthis, we were doing &#39;school at home&#39;, albeit even then in a relaxed <br/>\nfashion.  When we had Jonathan diagnosed, they tested his IQ at 88 <br/>\nand he&#39;s been consistently at a 1st/2nd grade level since around the <br/>\nage of 7.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince we&#39;ve been unschooling, his attitude has improved tenfold.  He <br/>\nno longer has emotional meltdowns and seems SOOO much happier!!  I <br/>\ncould tell that I had been pressuring him to &#39;catch up&#39; and that <br/>\nthis was doing more harm than good.  Hence the decision to just &#39;let <br/>\nit go&#39;.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe is very artistic and loves to draw.  He loves to play board <br/>\ngames, so I have no real concerns about his math skills, as I can <br/>\nsee that coming on its own, just through curiosity and play.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy concern with him is in the area of reading and pessimism.  <br/>\nBefore, when I was doing &#39;school at home&#39;, we worked through a <br/>\nphonics curriculum, and he did well with the decoding thing, but he <br/>\nstill does not read. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has the attitude of &#39;I can&#39;t read.&#39;  and  &#39;I don&#39;t know how to <br/>\nread.&#39;  Even though, from last year, when we were doing school at <br/>\nhome, I know he *can* read.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor instance, today he brought a popsicle stick to me with a joke on <br/>\nit and said, &quot;I can&#39;t read this.&quot;  The words were all simple, save <br/>\nfor one word and that was &#39;digital&#39;.  So I said, &quot;Is it just this <br/>\nword here?  That word is &#39;digital&#39;&quot;  And then, with prompting on my <br/>\npart, he read the rest of the joke with ease.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut his initial attitude was &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;  Is there any way that I can <br/>\nhelp him with this attitude?  In other words, if he has the attitude <br/>\nof &quot;I can&#39;t read,&quot; will that ever change on its own?  Or has the <br/>\nproverbial damage already been done?  Will he ever become a reader <br/>\nif he thinks he is not, or can&#39;t be, or, maybe even never will be <br/>\nable to become a reader?<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd is it better for me to encourage him to sound words out and, <br/>\ntherefore, figure it out?  Or is it better for me to read it for him <br/>\nand ignore the &#39;pessimistic&#39;, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude?<br/>\n <br/>\nBtw...he doesn&#39;t like to be read to.  He never has.  He has auditory <br/>\nsensitivity issues and I really think that being read to was <br/>\nalmost &#39;painful&#39; for him in a way, as he is easily overwhelmed by <br/>\nauditory stimuli.<br/>\n <br/>\nAny and all advice would be most welcome!!!  And if there is anyone <br/>\non this list unschooling a special needs child, I would LOVE to hear <br/>\nfrom you!!  I have yet to meet anyone, either in &#39;real life&#39; or <br/>\nonline, who is unschooling an autistic child, or any child on <br/>\nthe &#39;autism spectrum&#39;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;One day you&#39;ll wake up and realize you wasted $150,000 on an <br/>\neducation you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public <br/>\nlibrary.&quot; - Good Will Hunting</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88836,"nextTopicId":65958}}
