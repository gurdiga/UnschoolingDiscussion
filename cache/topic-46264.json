Someone wondered, and I can&#39;t find the original post so I&#39;m writing it here, about whether they should study the origins of the earth from a creationist or an evolutinary position.  Why not both?  Look at both critically.  Write to different scientist and religious leaders with your questions.  Compare.  Contrast.  Slice and dice.
