What works for us is if I sit in there when she starts and read to her. I don&#39;t have to read to her for the whole shower. Maybe a book on tape would help for the boys who don&#39;t want mom there. <br/>\nMary T. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84214,"nextTopicId":84220}}
