(Which, just to be confusing, is the title of the 2nd book.  <br/>\nThe first is Over Sea, Under Stone.)  It takes place in modern day Wales but <br/>\nthe kids deal with ancient Welsh gods or spirits.

I really like <br/>\nthe tone of the stories which is much more like a fantasy novel than other <br/>\nfairy tale compilations, which tend to be shy on character development and <br/>\nsense of place.  (But I&#39;d also say they&#39;re more of an adult/teen level.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the first couple of paragraphs of the first story:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sons of Tureen<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian loosed his sword in its sheath and called over his shoulder to his <br/>\nbrothers.  &quot;Rider coming!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey edged their horses up beside their elder broher and stared across the <br/>\nflat expanse of the Plain of Muirthemne.
