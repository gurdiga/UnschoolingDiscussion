Neither have most of the other people here, <br/>\nso it is difficult for them to counter even some of the most simplistic <br/>\narguments, without the ability to draw upon and articulate those somewhat <br/>\nmore complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it <br/>\nfrustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because <br/>\nthey are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and provide <br/>\nplenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES make <br/>\nsense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of our <br/>\ntax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a number <br/>\nof other purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics, <br/>\nnot even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for <br/>\nthat kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is the <br/>\nNHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get <br/>\nperpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n. If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop responding <br/>\nto them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and <br/>\nwant to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of us <br/>\ncan delete the messages more easily. Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Pam Sorooshian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40632,"nextTopicId":40602}}
