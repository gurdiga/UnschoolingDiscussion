But in<br/>\norder for it to succeed, it&#39;s IMPERATIVE that parents offer an<br/>\never-expanding variety of &quot;delights&quot; to which their children may wish to<br/>\nlatch themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, it&#39;s not enough to leave the child to fend for him or<br/>\nherself when it comes to discovering interests.  Wise parents aggressively<br/>\nseek opportunities to expose their children to the wider community, to<br/>\ncomplex issues, to a spectrum of people, to the greatest minds, and so<br/>\nforth.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake your children to an art museum.  Interpret a painting for them.  Then<br/>\nask for their interpretations.  Go home and create your own oil paintings.<br/>\nTake your children to a public meeting.  Point out the mayor.  Try to have<br/>\nthem meet the mayor, or a senator, or congressman.  Take them to a street<br/>\ndemonstration. Take them to the zoo.  Sit on a bench with them for awhile<br/>\nand watch a particular animal.  Talk about what you see.  Volunteer with<br/>\nyour children at a library, or other community center.  Take walks through<br/>\nnature preserves.  Intentionally slow down and truly notice the plants, and<br/>\nwildlife.  Write about it when you get home.  Seek out interesting and<br/>\ncreative people in your community; inventors, authors, scientists, poets,<br/>\netc.  Arrange to visit with these people in their homes, or go to hear them<br/>\nspeak, or write letters to them.  Visit the city hall, the state capitol,<br/>\nthe history museum, the bookstores.  Read books together everyday.  Talk<br/>\nabout ideas and philosophies at the dinner table.  Be a passionate scholar<br/>\nyourself.  Visit historical sites.  Talk about your visit.  Write letters to<br/>\ngrandparents.  Help your children imagine what life was like many years<br/>\nprevious when their grandparents were children themselves.  Take your<br/>\nchildren camping to a variety of places.  Go on guided tours whenever you<br/>\ncan.  Write about them after you return home.  Arrange for penpals for your<br/>\nchildren; ideally, this could be children from other countries and cultures.<br/>\nTravel often both locally and, when possible, internationally.  Make a point<br/>\nto talk with people on the street and in the shops.  Be endlessly curious.<br/>\nRead books about your travel destinations beforehand and then books about<br/>\nyour favorite places after the trip is over.  Record your itinerary in a<br/>\njournal.  Be actors in a local play.  Join a gymnastics club.  Take fencing<br/>\nlessons as a family.  Learn to play a musical instrument.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list goes on and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nProper unschooling is anything but passive and directionless.  On the<br/>\ncontrary, it is arguably one of the most demanding of all learning methods.<br/>\nAnd, we think it could be one of the most stimulating as well.  Parents just<br/>\nneed to break out of their comfort zone and aggressively seek to harness the<br/>\nendless resources of their community and ultimately the world around them.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a job for the feint-hearted or those who are happier just following<br/>\ninstructions from so-called experts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, it&#39;s about lighting a fire within yourself and letting it<br/>\nburn brightly enough that your children naturally desire to become engulfed<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Andersen<br/>\nUncoventional Ideas at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen\">http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen</a><br/>\nThemestream Articles<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_by_tag.gsp?auth_id=34436\">http://www.themestream.com/gspd_browse/browse/view_by_tag.gsp?auth_id=34436</a><br/>\nRead about the Andersen family travels:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html\">http://www.spiritone.com/~andersen/travel.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13811,"nextTopicId":13814}}
