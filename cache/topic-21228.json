It is reassuring to<br/>\nknow you are all there.....albeit in cyber space!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome comments and questions came to mind as I read the<br/>\npostings. <br/>\n1. Two years off....? I don&#39;t understand.  How can<br/>\nteaching be separated from mothering?  They seem<br/>\nbasically the same to me. Do others have differing<br/>\noutlook?<br/>\n2.  It is WONDERFUL to see the diversity of ages! <br/>\nreassuring to me to know cyber(netically?) some other<br/>\nmothers near my own age, and therefore some of the<br/>\nsame experiences.  But to know that some of the things<br/>\nthat my generation pioneered (sort of) are being<br/>\ncontinued.....some of the good things......is truly<br/>\nlovely.  I don&#39;t have any daughters....but each of you<br/>\nis truly a blessing to your own mother.  I&#39;m kind of<br/>\nlike the old man in the Millions and Millions of Cats<br/>\nbook!  I did have the opportunity to have custody of<br/>\nmy sister when she was 11 until she married and my<br/>\nniece as a toddler for a summer.  How different is the<br/>\nrelationship of mother to daughter or little girl or<br/>\nyoung woman than to boys.  I have 4 boys.....3 are<br/>\nyoung men. And a lovely daughter-in-law.And a step<br/>\ndaughter with 2 toddlers.  She became my family, too,<br/>\nwhen she was already an adult.<br/>\n3.  My own mother was an alcholholic.  And I suppose I<br/>\nmust be and abstaining one.  Basically though, at 51 I<br/>\nseem to be fine.....have some unrelated health<br/>\nproblems....but I just wanted to reassure those of you<br/>\nwith the less than perfect parents that it isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily a sentence of birth defects, hidden or<br/>\notherwise.  My own children are all healthy, gifted,<br/>\nand beautiful as are my nieces and nephews.  I just<br/>\nwanted those of you strong beautiful mothers who<br/>\nDECIDED to break the cycle that your courage does<br/>\nmanifest in the next generation as pure beauty.  And I<br/>\nthank you.  You have bettered the world just by<br/>\nexisting!<br/>\n4.  I live in Florida. Florida laws do required that<br/>\n&quot;homeschooled&quot; children be tested with the same<br/>\nstandardized tests as the ps children.  If the hs<br/>\nchild is found to be &quot;behind&quot; there is one year to do<br/>\nremediation. Then the child is forced to enter ps at<br/>\nwhatever level they tested. Records and samples of<br/>\nwork indicating progression are to be reviewed by<br/>\nschool approved whoevers and are to be produced on<br/>\nrequest....within a few days or so.  That basically is<br/>\nit.  Enough though.  No escape from the standardized<br/>\nnorm.  Which I don&#39;t anticipate being a problem, but<br/>\nit must be awfull for some families. Oh, and the state<br/>\nwants a list of ALL the books and authors which are<br/>\nused in the learning process. Ha!! Wonder if we can<br/>\ndownload the card catolgue at the library? Expect we<br/>\nhave lots of books that they don&#39;t!!<br/>\n5. The high level of spirituality which is exhibited<br/>\nthough the manner in which all of you express<br/>\nyourselves is SO uplifting.  Thank you.<br/>\n6  THANK YOU LIST MOM AND MODERATOR!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to reading your posts as<br/>\nfrequently as I can get to it.  But now it is bedtime<br/>\nstory time.
