I could no longer afford it and started working on learning other ways to cope. It doesn&#39;t always work as well but I am doing much better now that I know what the source is.I try to steer away from medicating until I know that other options do not work. You need to find out what works best, everyone is different. **If your child is on it and they are slow, drained and sluggish you need to have the dosage checked and lowered. It took over 2 years to get the levels right for me. Most people don&#39;t realize that it takes 30 days to really see a real change and tell if it&#39;s working. I have known people to send their kids back to the doctors and doctors uping the dosage because they were not changing &quot;fast enough&quot;. End result- too quick to dispense &quot;standard&quot; dosage for all kids, this leads to overmedicating most kids. Ritalin can be a wonderful thing when dispensed right. These days school systems and doctors as well as parents are looking for a quick fix and the kids pay the price for not fitting into their square box ...(round peg in a ...).~Annie~~You may laugh at me because I am different.

At around 13 or so (each child is different), the child&#39;s body chemistry changes and Ritalin becomes ineffective------or rather changes.
