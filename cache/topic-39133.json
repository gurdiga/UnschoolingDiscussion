I quit lessons in <br/>\nthe middle of the 2nd book and never did learn to play that.  If a <br/>\nteacher had &quot;taught&quot; me (allowed me to learn?) that piece, or if <br/>\nsomeone had encouraged me that I COULD play if I tried to plunk <br/>\nthrough it who knows if I&#39;d have kept with the piano?
