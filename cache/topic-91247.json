I know that my husband would <br/>\nprefer that I not talk to him about my horses all the time, buying stuff for them, <br/>\nbrushing them, even calling him at work to tell him something horsey that <br/>\nneeds to be picked up. I have even woken him up at early in the morning so I <br/>\ncould ride or fix a fence. However, they are my fun thing to do, I learn a lot <br/>\nfrom them, patience, kindness, how to be quiet, fixing tack, ( I have yet to <br/>\nlearn to stay on when they buck) carpentry, loading h ay so it stays on the truck. <br/>\nHe knows how much pleasure I get from them and he goes along with me, helping <br/>\nany way he can, and I am 40!!!!!!<br/>\nI also had a hard time with the constant &quot;Guess how many attack points this <br/>\none has mom?&quot; stuff, but he really loves those cards and that game. I took him <br/>\nto  a local gaming store to try dueling with a group that meets there, but he <br/>\nwas not comfortable trying. So we look at them together and talk about them <br/>\nalways.My son is 8 by the way.  I used to hate all things like that, pokemon, <br/>\ndigimon etc. Now I talk to him about it and look at it and it is interesting. <br/>\nMy mom has many times scoffed at my horse interest, in fact when I  was a kid <br/>\nshe would not let me have lessons or visit horses, and I lived and breathed <br/>\nhorses as a child.Drawing them, reading about them , pretending to be them . It <br/>\ntook till now to have them for myself. You know what, I am still completely <br/>\nentranced by them.She still thinks it is stupid.She tells me how much she hates <br/>\nhorses and it still makes me feel like that frustrated little kid.<br/>\nTake a deep breath and watch a yu-gi-oh show, it&#39;s not so bad and gives you a <br/>\ncommon ground of communication. I learned that here, and at Sandra&#39;s website.<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91187,"nextTopicId":91278}}
