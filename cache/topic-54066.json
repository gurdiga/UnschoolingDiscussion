Here is a dictionary definition for you. . .<br/>\n<br/>\ndiploma: a document certifying the successful completion of a course <br/>\nof study [Source: WordNet ® 1.6, © 1997 Princeton University]<br/>\n<br/>\n      A diploma is a piece of paper (unless you use real sheepskin) <br/>\nthat designates or confers the completion of some line of study.  We <br/>\nfind it interesting that parents who home school, and do so <br/>\nconfidently, turn to jelly when it is time to award a diploma.  If <br/>\nyou have home schooled your child and they have completed your <br/>\ndesignated course of study for high school, you may and should award <br/>\na diploma.<br/>\n      The issue is not whether you may award a diploma, but what does <br/>\nthat diploma mean to others?  There are several considerations here. <br/>\nIn many states, including New York, the state mandates that only the <br/>\nState Board of Education (in NY, the board of Regents) is authorized <br/>\nto grant a diploma. That is their opinion.  We do award our children <br/>\ndiplomas, and though the state may not recognize them as &quot;accredited&quot; <br/>\nthis does not mean much to us. After all, we know plenty of people <br/>\nwho hold those accredited diplomas who could not pass the <br/>\nrequirements to receive one of our diplomas!<br/>\n      Frankly, we both hold those accredited and coveted New York <br/>\nRegent&#39;s High School Diplomas, and neither of us has had to show them <br/>\nto anyone, ever.  We have been hired by employers, accepted into <br/>\nprestigious colleges (MIT and the Air Force Academy) and those <br/>\ndiplomas did not enter the picture.  What did matter was our <br/>\ntranscript and college board exam scores. The official transcript is <br/>\nthe official record of the student&#39;s course work and grades.  The <br/>\ntranscript will be validated by college board exams and sometimes <br/>\nwith a portfolio of completed work.<br/>\n      So, will a home school diploma allow our students to get jobs, <br/>\nenter college, receive financial aid, or join the military?  It is <br/>\ntrue that in the past most colleges required those accredited pieces <br/>\nof paper.  However, the current climate is quickly changing in favor <br/>\nof the home school. Colleges and universities are beginning to <br/>\nrecognize that home school students are generally very well prepared <br/>\nfor higher learning, regardless of their lack of &quot;accredited&quot; <br/>\neducation.  There are now research studies that indicate the academic <br/>\nsuccess of home school programs, and the success of home school <br/>\nstudents in institutions of higher learning.<br/>\n      In the past, some institutions required a GED or a <br/>\nstate-accredited diploma for admission.  The United States House of <br/>\nRepresentatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and Senate <br/>\nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources addressed these colleges and <br/>\nuniversities in a report accompanying Pub.L. No. 105-244 <br/>\n(Reauthoriztion of the Higher Education Act) with the following <br/>\nrecommendation to those that accept federal funding: The Committee is <br/>\naware that many colleges and universities now require applicants from <br/>\nnon-public, private, or non-traditional secondary programs (including <br/>\nhome schools) to submit scores from additional standardized tests . . <br/>\n. (GED or SAT-II) in lieu of a transcript/diploma from an accredited <br/>\nhigh school . . . Given that standardized test scores (SAT and ACT) <br/>\nand portfolio- or performance-based assessments may also provide a <br/>\nsound basis for an admission decision regarding these students, the <br/>\nCommittee recommends that colleges and universities consider using <br/>\nthese assessments for applicants educated in non-public, private, and <br/>\nnon-traditional programs rather than requiring them to undergo <br/>\nadditional types of standardized testing.  Requiring additional <br/>\ntesting only of students educated in these settings could reasonably <br/>\nbe seen as discriminatory . . .<br/>\n      The Committee believes that college admissions should be <br/>\ndetermined on academic ability of the student and not the <br/>\naccreditation status of the school in which he or she received a <br/>\nsecondary education.<br/>\n      Clearly, our Congress recognizes the discriminatory practice of <br/>\nrequiring home schooled students to obtain a GED.  This practice has <br/>\nunnerved many home schoolers since we find the GED requirements to be <br/>\nan insult to the fine education our children have received.<br/>\n      In another section of the Amendments sited above, the Committees <br/>\nchanged the eligibility requirements for federal college financial <br/>\naid.  The law used to require an accredited high school diploma, GED, <br/>\nor a semester of college work to prove eligibility for aid.  Now the <br/>\nrequirement has changed to include those students who have &quot;completed <br/>\na secondary school education in a home school setting that is treated <br/>\nas a home school or private school under state law.&quot;<br/>\n      These advances in the recognition of the effectiveness of home <br/>\nschools are very promising.  Already two states have enacted <br/>\nlegislation to restrict discrimination of home school students, <br/>\nothers are sure to follow.      The military has also changed its <br/>\npolicies about requiring the GED for home schooled students.<br/>\n      Employers will accept a transcript, or they will accept a home <br/>\nschool diploma.  The reality is, job applications will usually ask <br/>\nwhat school was attended and whether the person graduated.  The home <br/>\nschool student should just write in &quot;home school&quot; and say they did <br/>\ngraduate.<br/>\n      Lets face it, when we decided to home school, we believed we <br/>\nwere able to do a good job of educating our children.  We believed <br/>\nthat we would do better than the government sponsored schools, and <br/>\nbetter than private schools.  (If you do not believe this, you have <br/>\nno business home schooling!) Why would we not believe, then, that our <br/>\nhome school diploma is better than a government diploma?<br/>\n      Home school coalitions in some states (for instance <br/>\nPennsylvania) have worked with the state department of education to <br/>\nprovide a program for home schooled students to obtain a <br/>\nstate-accredited diploma.  This may be of interest to you.  To be <br/>\nhonest, we find these efforts counter-productive. We do not recognize <br/>\nthe state as the ultimate authority in determining what constitutes a <br/>\n&quot;good education.&quot;  Therefore, we do not feel the state-accredited <br/>\ndiploma is of real value.  The essence of home schooling is that it <br/>\nis parent-directed.  It follows than that it should be <br/>\nparent-accredited.  Colleges, universities, financial aid programs, <br/>\nand potential employers are quickly realizing the value of the home <br/>\nschool diploma, and accreditation is becoming a non-issue.<br/>\n      So, where do you get this piece of paper?  You print it <br/>\nyourself, or order it from a printer.  There, that was simple! <br/>\nActually, there are organizations that sell diplomas especially for <br/>\nhome school use, that you can personalize yourself for the graduate. <br/>\nSome of these come with very nice covers as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcerpted from &quot;The Guidance Manual for the Christian Home School: A <br/>\nParent&#39;s Guide to Preparing Home School Students for College and <br/>\nCareer,&quot; by Laurie Callihan (Career Press, 2000).

From roughly the <br/>\nages of 14-18, you sit in a chair six hours a day for 180 days each <br/>\nyear. You study carefully balanced amounts of English, math, social <br/>\nstudies, and science, and take extras like foreign language, physical <br/>\neducation, and drama. Do all that with passing grades, and they give <br/>\nyou a diploma.<br/>\n             But how do homeschooling families decide when their <br/>\nteenagers have completed high school?

We&#39;ve asked ourselves <br/>\nand other people have certainly asked us. However, recent <br/>\ndevelopments are making the answer more complicated than it used to <br/>\nbe, in some ways limiting the options available to homeschoolers who <br/>\nwant conventional credentials.<br/>\n             Should we homeschoolers be worried about getting <br/>\nconventional credentials? Are homeschoolers&#39; futures jeopardized <br/>\nbecause the path to a conventional diploma is less clear-cut than it <br/>\nis for a student in a conventional school? Why and how is the process <br/>\nof getting a diploma becoming more complex?
