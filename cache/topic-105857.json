The &quot;today&quot; was early 1981, so the article is twenty five  <br/>\nyears old.  Please, if you have any doubts about whether spanking is bad,  or if <br/>\nyou have relatives or friends who spank, or if you&#39;re just interested in  the <br/>\nstate of the world and other nations&#39; opinions of the U.S. (for American  <br/>\nreaders especially) it&#39;s worth a read and probably a link worth saving in a safe  <br/>\nplace.  _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm_\">http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm)\">http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll link it from my spanking page too, _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spanking_\">http://sandradodd.com/spanking_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spanking)\">http://sandradodd.com/spanking)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nI thought this quote was about much more than spanking and so even those of  <br/>\nus who are already resolved not to spank might consider these ideas:<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Spanking is primarily an adult or parental problem. When the spanking  <br/>\nsituation is analyzed, in nearly every incident there is a personal problem of  <br/>\nparents who resorted to the use of the &quot;rod.&quot; It was really the adult ego that  <br/>\nhad been defied, an adult order disobeyed, an adult request denied, adult  <br/>\nauthority challenged, adult pride or adult respect offended.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes people&#39;s unschooling or parenting blocks are of that order  too.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s because they&#39;re putting their parental pride or identity above  the real <br/>\nneeds of their real child.  Some parents put their personal desire  for a child <br/>\nto &quot;do a workbook&quot; or to recite times tables far above what the  child wants <br/>\nor needs or would benefit by.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a fun or easy thing to think about, but it&#39;s important.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105852,"nextTopicId":105836}}
