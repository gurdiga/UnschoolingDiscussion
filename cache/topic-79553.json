If you do something and expect people to help and are<br/>\nresentfully doing it alone, that negative energy seeps out and drives people<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about your husband angrily cleaning up something that seems foolish to<br/>\nclean up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about him cleaning up something that seems foolish but he&#39;s doing it<br/>\njoyfully and asks if you&#39;d like to help or just spend time with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich scenario would you be more likely to join in?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we expect our kids to do something because if they don&#39;t we&#39;ll be angry<br/>\nwe&#39;re teaching them that they bear the burden of responsibility for our<br/>\nfeelings and should set aside their own needs to tend to ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we see the lives we create for them as a gift and invite them joyfully to<br/>\njoin us (or not!) the whole family is more joyful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want them to treat our needs with respect, then we need to treat their<br/>\nneeds with respect too. Most parents would get mad at that and say they<br/>\nabsolutely treat their children&#39;s needs with respect. But if they were to<br/>\nobserve themselves objectively they&#39;d find that they were picking and<br/>\nchoosing which needs to respect. They&#39;d be judging what they child needed in<br/>\norder to decide if they really needed it and whether to take that need<br/>\nseriously or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want them to treat our needs -- all our needs, especially the needs<br/>\nthey don&#39;t understand and seem foolish to them -- with respect, we need to<br/>\ndo the same for them. If they say that finishing a level on a video game or<br/>\nseeing the end of a cartoon is important, we have to trust that it is<br/>\nimportant. (And it helps to be involved enough in their lives to understand<br/>\nwhat it means to them too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Like, if I&#39;m getting ready to set the table and<br/>\n&gt; my kids start getting out paint, I&#39;m going to tell them that what<br/>\n&gt; they are about to do is going to interfere with what I&#39;m doing, and<br/>\n&gt; that they should have asked first before getting it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would turn that around. Rather than demanding that they respect my needs,<br/>\nI&#39;d respect their need to paint and help them find a better place to set up<br/>\nso that both our needs could be met.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it really helps to turn my seemingly reasonable reaction around and<br/>\ntry to hear it coming from my daughter. If I were inadvertently setting up a<br/>\nproject in the middle of where she was about to build a fort, would I want<br/>\nto hear &quot;I was about to build a fort there. You should have asked first<br/>\nbefore doing that.&quot; Or would I rather hear &quot;I was about to build a fort<br/>\nthere.
