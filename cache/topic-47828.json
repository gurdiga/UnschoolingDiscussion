I have been so amazed at some of the lovely patterns <br/>\nAnna comes up with so easily.    The first necklace she made, she labored over <br/>\nchosing the beads and trying to get the pattern just right.  She was hesitant to <br/>\njust go with the flow and pick the beads she likes.   Her first necklace <br/>\nturned out beautifully , and fortunately, she also gained a lot of confidence and <br/>\nstopped stressing over &quot;doing it right&quot;  Now, she just effortlessly comes up <br/>\nwith beautiful patterns without much thought.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  A couple of days ago, my dad was ragging us about not doing anything except <br/>\nmaking jewelry ( which was entirely incorrect, it just happened to be what we <br/>\nwere doing while I done my laundry at thier house)    We took his lecture in <br/>\nstride and laughed about it.    Then Anna said, &quot;you know, I haven&#39;t learned <br/>\nanything while making this jewelry, it&#39;s just all for fun&quot;  I said &quot;Anna, you <br/>\nhave learned a lot about patterns and colors and aesthetics&quot;  She said&quot; &quot;Huh?  <br/>\nit&#39;s just a necklace, how does that relate to anything else&quot;  I said.. &quot; There <br/>\nare patterns in everything, every kind of design, man made and natural.  <br/>\nThink about clothing, fashions, buildings...  Having a good eye for patterns and <br/>\ndesign is one of the most important things in many many jobs... Fashion <br/>\ndesigner,  architect, landscaper,  engineer...  We went on to talk about how patterns <br/>\nare really everywhere.   How creating patterns is in cake decorating and  <br/>\nfood presentation.  How folks study patterns in animals,  and lots of other stuff <br/>\nI can&#39;t remember now.. lol.   We were just sitting and talking and making <br/>\nnecklaces.   We didn&#39;t start doing beads in order to learn about patterns and <br/>\ndesign and aesthetics, we do it because we enjoy it.    But it was really <br/>\ninteresting to discuss how far reaching making a beaded necklace is in relation to <br/>\npatterns and thier impact on our world.

We went <br/>\nto the local boys and girls club and the kids had a gym, pool tables, table <br/>\nhockey tables, board games, and beading if they chose.  The kids went from one <br/>\nthing to another and had a great time being together.  Needless to say there <br/>\nwere only a few of us there.  The rest of the homeschoolers were at home doing <br/>\n&quot;school work&quot;.  (yuck). Then we went to A C Moore to look at all the craft stuff <br/>\nand get the boys some more drawing tablets.

Same with <br/>\ncollege: if the school requires SAT&#39;s she MIGHT need to get the books/&#39;puter <br/>\ngames about studying for the SAT. <br/>\n<br/>\nCurious, though? Why does she want to join the military?
