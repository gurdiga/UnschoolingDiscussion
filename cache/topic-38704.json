My husband likes Minesweeper.   You find bombs <br/>\nwithout setting them off.  You know how many but you don&#39;t know where they <br/>\nare until you mathematically determine it.  Holly and Keith are on a quest to <br/>\nfigure out whether Holly&#39;s analysis of how the program works is right.  <br/>\nHolly&#39;s ten.  Keith&#39;s a real professonional math-using engineer.  Holly says <br/>\nthe first move will never be a bomb.  Keith hadn&#39;t thought of that, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re playing with that theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called Keith at work, and he said:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Minesweeper involves seeing pattern possibilities based on the exposed <br/>\ninformation.  It&#39;s about permutations.<br/>\nWhen you have one number exposed and everything else around it is not exposed <br/>\nthere are eight possible connecting blocks, and the number will tell you <br/>\nthere are two bombs, or four bombs, and you figure out all the permutations.  <br/>\nSometimes it is just guessing.  Sometimes it&#39;s not.  The more information <br/>\nyou&#39;re working with, the more you can resolve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s deductive reasoning based on patterns.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Keith plays, he&#39;s taking a break from physical activity.  He&#39;s zoning <br/>\nout, in a way, but while he&#39;s doing a mathematical puzzle (which is relaxing <br/>\nfor him), he can think about all KINDS of things, and other people will leave <br/>\nhim alone because he&#39;s &quot;concentrating.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly plays and discusses her thoughts with Keith, she&#39;s doing math with <br/>\na professional mathematician.  Not many ten year olds get to do that!<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, I might be playing Tetris Plus on the Mac in the other room while <br/>\nI&#39;m on the phone talking to my sister or a friend.  I like it because it&#39;s <br/>\nfast.  I like it because it involves color and patterns and srategies unlike <br/>\nwhat I use in my regular days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;On the other <br/>\nhand, I can see the attraction to some of the role playing games. In the case <br/>\nof role playing games though, I can&#39;t see spending so much time and effort in <br/>\na fantasy world, when that same amount of effort expended in real life, might <br/>\nlead to real accomplishments in the real world. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs reading a novel &quot;real life&quot;?  <br/>\nIs reading poetry real accomplishment? <br/>\nGoing to plays?<br/>\nReading literature is HUGELY prized by academia.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid read Oliver Twist (which I read three times before I was out of my <br/>\nteens) it&#39;s not as much reading and thought as my own boys have expended in <br/>\nrole playing games already, and they&#39;re 13 and 15.  Reading the cards, the <br/>\nguide books, the rule books, the related novels, not just discussing or <br/>\nthinking about the behavior of different Japanese clans for L5R but acting <br/>\nfrom that place is more &quot;literary analysis&quot; than most kids get in the best <br/>\nhigh schools.  It&#39;s just different &quot;literature.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we called plot they call &quot;story line.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not passive, like reading a book, but they can make decisions that <br/>\naffect other people&#39;s character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who have played a lot of role playing games will gain the kinds of <br/>\nexperiences useful in being writers, lawyers, analysts of various kinds, <br/>\nhistorians (what happened and how and why?)...   Why not get those skills in <br/>\na way that seems like &quot;just playing&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to repetitive actions and productivity...<br/>\n<br/>\nCrocheting afghans.    WHY do people do that?<br/>\nYou can buy an afghan at a thrift store for $8.  You can&#39;t even buy the yarn <br/>\nto make one for that much.  There are afghans enough in the world.  Why make <br/>\nmore?<br/>\n<br/>\nKnitting sweaters.  Why?<br/>\nSocks?  Insane, since they&#39;re available for a dollar a pair.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet people justify those things on the basis of relaxation, artistic <br/>\nexpression, labors of love, something to do with their hands while they watch <br/>\nmovies or listen to music or talk with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it virtue for grown women, but &quot;wastefulness&quot; if it&#39;s boys?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the prejudice against kids is one of the first things unschoolers <br/>\nshould dump.  It helps a lot to know that kids LIKE repetition, the like to <br/>\nsing songs over and over, to see the same cartoon more than once, to play a <br/>\ngame again even though they beat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38772,"nextTopicId":38803}}
