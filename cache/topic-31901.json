He&#39;s almost 6 and wanted it to be just <br/>\nlike his cousins (the one with a buzz cut).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t mind, after all it is his hair and his choice. He feels he <br/>\ndid a wonderful job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to tell you what it looks like, but I find it quite <br/>\ndarling. Like the beauty one finds in the misits on the island.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe showed me how he was careful with the scissor so not to cut himself <br/>\n(he turned his head upside down so he could see what he was cutting). AND <br/>\nhe had the forethought to cut his hair into a &#39;box&#39; so it wouldn&#39;t be all <br/>\nover the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I find this all quite endearing. Until his dad got home. One of my <br/>\nother unschoolers who is having a hard time adjusting :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe look on the kid&#39;s face when his father said &#39;that looks stupid, its <br/>\nall uneven&#39; was enough to make a mother cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy O&#39; why do people INSIST on judging and offering nothing but <br/>\nnegativity on issues that can be so full of learning and insight. . .<br/>\n<br/>\n*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31891,"nextTopicId":31894}}
