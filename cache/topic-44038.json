Now my son has &quot;two Daddies&quot; but he&#39;s kind of weird about it. When his dad is visiting, he calls both Cary (my ex) and Michael (my husband) daddy. It gets very confusing. When his father isn&#39;t here he vacillates between calling Michael &quot;Daddy&quot; or Michael. I have always been &quot;Mama&quot;. He called me Virginia one time, to introduce me to his teacher and I thought the child would die of embarrassment. He even apologized later because he thought he had been disrespectful. I just told him not to worry about it, that it was ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMike and I do not fuss at him about this. We are in the south (SC) and I was raised with strict adherence to kids never calling parents by their names and using sir and mam. He uses sir and mam because I think it is respectful but the whole issue of who to call what has always been a non-issue. Life is too short to waste on such trivia&lt;G&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an interesting topic though. I never realized there were so many differing views on something I just sort of take for granted.
