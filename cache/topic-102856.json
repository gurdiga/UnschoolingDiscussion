They continually call each<br/>\nother Mr, Miss or Mrs despite working with each other constantly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also remember working in the theatre in Sydney, where there was a triple<br/>\ntier of formal address. With the exception of addressing the biggest star<br/>\nand the Producers, the Americans were more egalitarian and informal, than we<br/>\nwere (Australians) but visiting British performers and those from the Opera<br/>\nwere most formal, and had more of an expectation of deference.

My late FIL, whom always engendered instant awe just by his<br/>\npresence, always said, &quot;It&#39;s Jim&quot; to everyone on the set. There is a lot of<br/>\n&quot;Yes, boss&quot; within departments, &quot;What do you need, bro?&quot; between colleagues<br/>\nof close or equal status, but the use of &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;sir&quot; to department<br/>\nheads and the Director, but in a friendly manner. Producers get Mr. or Ms. -<br/>\nat least to their faces - unless they also say &quot;Mr. Smith is my father, call<br/>\nme Bill.&quot; (The most common response from men is that line.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has called people &quot;miss&quot; or &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; or &quot;sir&quot; if they are strangers and<br/>\nshe is trying to get their attention. &quot;Excuse me miss, I want a hot dog.&quot; It<br/>\nseems to tickle them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

All things being equal-ish (like your story above) Ben says he divides it 30/30/30. 30% is respect for the rank (that&#39;s mandated). 30% is respect for the office he holds, and 30% is for the person. <br/>\n<br/>\nBen pins on LtCol this year and is squadron commander. He is mandated to receive his &quot;sirs&quot; because of his rank of LtCol. He gets a certain amount of respect as squadron commander, because it&#39;s pretty important. But the last 30% is his alone to earn as the person. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy you described should not have been sir-ed nor did he deserve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193310064,"authorName":"werefree2learn","from":"&quot;werefree2learn&quot; &lt;joyerin@...&gt;","profile":"werefree2learn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Yes, Ma&#39;am","postDate":"1107034860","msgId":102874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN0Z3Z0YytzbGlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBNjlBRUU3LjFFREU2QzQ1LjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102872,"nextInTopic":102877,"prevInTime":102873,"nextInTime":102875,"topicId":102856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... stranger or are there situations/people you wouldn t use it in/on? ... my respect.

I would happily say yes, <br/>\nma&#39;am and no, sir to my aunt and uncle in NC if they wanted me too.<br/>\nI respect and like them tons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe I know some of the reasons why came to my ideas about <br/>\nrespecting people.  When I was a child and told I needed to respect <br/>\nmy elders (in the north) just because they were older than me.  I <br/>\nbegan to dislike automatic respect because the people that always <br/>\ntold me I &#39;had&#39; to respect them always seemed to be the ones that <br/>\ndeserved it the least.  I remember getting in big trouble once in <br/>\nschool and once in church for no showing &#39;enough&#39; respect to my <br/>\nelders (I believe I was supposedly back talking).  I thought <br/>\nblakkk!!  Do they deserve my respect?  Usually they didn&#39;t, they <br/>\nwere bullying me and I even saw it as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven once I enlisted in the AF I wouldn&#39;t say all the sir&#39;s and  <br/>\nsuch unless I was flat out told I had to or would get some kind of <br/>\nwritten reprimand(happened only once or twice).  When I joined at 18 <br/>\nto get away from home I guess I didn&#39;t think about &#39;having&#39; to say, <br/>\nma&#39;am and such.  Yes, ma&#39;am and such in basic training (boot camp) <br/>\njust seemed like a part of the game of being degraded and made to <br/>\nfeel little, as well as being yelled at ect.  At my first base <br/>\nthough yet again some enlisted person who was in my classes and <br/>\naround my same age with a slightly higher rank than me (he had some <br/>\ncollege) insisted I say yes, sir ect. to him.  He was definitely <br/>\nfrom the south somewhere.  He so... didn&#39;t deserve such formal <br/>\nrespect imo then (none of us liked him) and I couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t do <br/>\nit.

The north was colononized by the poor of Europe---those who were escaping. The South was colonized by wealthy British landowners, whose land was granted to them by the king (check out the state names: Maryland, Virginia, Carolinas, Georgia---royal references). They owned land and horses---and they became the officers. So....they made the military rules and regulations. Now it&#39;s just become tradition and form following function.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoutherners made up the majority of officers in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the War Between the States---because they had horses and money and could fund the war effort. They also brought many of their servants (not slaves) and farmworkers as aids and enlisted personnel because of trust and duty. Kind of &#39;feudal&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Southerners have always felt a bit more of a sense of duty to country because so many of the &#39;big&#39; original settlers still held an allegiance to the king---they were here not to escape tyranny, but to get MORE!&lt;g&gt; I also think it&#39;s not so great a leap to go from taking orders from the king of England to taking them from the president! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSoutherners are also more comfortable with the chain of command and deference to authority. BUT, because of the legacy of rank (granted by the king), I think Southerners don&#39;t like to take orders from &quot;lessers&quot;----which is how they viewed the northern settlers/states. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the early establishment of the US military, which was based on European model, simply kept a lot of the European system---which WAS based on rank. It just so happened that so was the South. I think it&#39;s a bit more clear than the Chicken and the Egg. I think it&#39;s a higher sense of duty to country as well as a comfort level with rank (sir & ma&#39;am) that encourages more Southerners to join the service. (Being a redneck may have something to do with it too! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is truly considered *honorable* to serve in the military here, as opposed to in other regions of the country where it is often seen as a last resort.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Yes, Ma&#39;am","postDate":"1107023171","msgId":102858,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMTI5LjEwMjYxMi4zMjE2LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":102857,"nextInTopic":102859,"prevInTime":102857,"nextInTime":102859,"topicId":102856,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
