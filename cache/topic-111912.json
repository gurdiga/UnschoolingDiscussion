Thanks for the idea! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to Encarta Dictionary &quot;offering bribes&quot; means<br/>\n  &quot;the offering of money or other incentives to persuade somebody to do<br/>\nsomething, especially something dishonest or illegal&quot;, so no wonder the<br/>\nword/concept has a bad rap in parenting circles. Maybe people who are afraid<br/>\nof bribery have the instinctive understanding that the desired<br/>\n&quot;good/compliant behavior&quot; might be fundamentally inauthentic and a<br/>\nsuppression of true needs so it really is persuading a child to do something<br/>\n&quot;dishonest&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that offering to pay your child for a job of work is in the<br/>\nsame league as that kind of bribery. If you would pay another sitter to be a<br/>\ncompanion then surely it is ok to pay someone in the family in the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about just saying &quot;Would you like to earn some extra money by .....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think honestly offering to pay a child, with the option to decline, is<br/>\nmuch more empowering to the child than any concept of bribery which<br/>\ndisempowers by removing choice and creating obligation. Earning is the<br/>\nopposite of bribery.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda wish that we could reclaim the word bribery so that every act of<br/>\nkindness or expression of thanks doesn&#39;t get tainted with the idea that some<br/>\nkind of debt bargain is being made. It makes me feel sad to think that<br/>\npeople are out there thinking that any time they might come home with a toy<br/>\nthey are &quot;bribing&quot; their child for good behavior, so they refrain from doing<br/>\nit, or do it with strings attached. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to give Jayn stuff without expectation or conditions. So far she has<br/>\nemphatically refused any kind of allowance. The whole idea distresses her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Thanks for the idea!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do places of business get people to go to work without &quot;bribery&quot;?<br/>\nHow do you get an auto dealer to give you a car without bribery?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s supposed to do something anyway and holds out on you  <br/>\nuntil you pay them, that&#39;s a bribe.   If something is not someone&#39;s  <br/>\njob or someone&#39;s property and they negotiate for an exchange, that&#39;s   <br/>\ncommerce, not bribery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some truisms that are spoken without real examination and I  <br/>\nthink the very vague rules against bribery are right up top there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a situation in which a kid is supposed to be absolutely obedient  <br/>\nto any spoken whim of the parent, and other parents are advising and  <br/>\nencouraging that parent to &quot;demand obedience,&quot; then those advisors  <br/>\nand watchers would say &quot;Don&#39;t bribe your child to cooperate, MAKE him  <br/>\ncooperate.&quot;  MAKE him go to bed at 8:00, brush his teeth the way you  <br/>\ntold him to, eat spinach, wear shoes that hurt, MAKE him babysit,  <br/>\nfold the laundry, do the dishes, read to his brother.  Don&#39;t  pay him  <br/>\nto do what he is &quot;supposed&quot; to do, and what he &quot;ought&quot; to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phrases &quot;ought to&quot; and &quot;supposed to&quot; are so old, and have been  <br/>\nrecited for so many years (hundreds, in the case of &quot;ought to&quot; at  <br/>\nleast) without conscious thought that people don&#39;t even think about  <br/>\nwhat they literally mean.  &quot;Supposed to&quot; is kind of easy; you can  <br/>\ndeconstruct it, and it loses a lot of power.  &quot;Ought&quot; is related to  <br/>\nowing and debt.  Obligation.  No choice except dishonor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not uncommon for families to require children to take care of  <br/>\nyounger siblings, but it does suggest a situation in which that child  <br/>\nis the powerless property of the parent.   If a parent decides to  <br/>\nrespect the child&#39;s wishes and freedom and still wants him to sit  <br/>\nwith a younger child and read or play, the older child should be  <br/>\nthought of as a free agent, another human.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you asked an adult friend to take care of your child, would you  <br/>\nsay &quot;And I&#39;m not going to bribe you to do this, either, just do  <br/>\nit!&quot;?    Not a good way to keep friends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend might well *offer* to keep your child sometimes, but if you  <br/>\nexpected it all the time, or assumed it would be free and at your  <br/>\nconvenience, that would be asking too much.   So if you look at the  <br/>\nsituation that way, asking your older child to put his needs aside  <br/>\nfor your benefit, the &quot;ought&quot; is on your end, and you owe him, rather  <br/>\nthan him owing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we can come up against another phrase spoken for generations,  <br/>\nand that is &quot;I don&#39;t owe you anything,&quot; which has been spoken by  <br/>\nparents to children for a long time, but it&#39;s harsh and mean, and in  <br/>\nthese days of choice, and in the light of compassion, it&#39;s just not  <br/>\neven true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith over six billion people on the planet, for a parent to expect a  <br/>\nchild to say &quot;Than you SO much that you brought me into the world and  <br/>\ngave me life!&quot; is quite a stretch.  Life can be harsh and painful.   <br/>\nThere is some difference when the mother has absolutely no choice  <br/>\nwhatsoever, but in this culture there are lots of ways and times to  <br/>\nsay &quot;No&quot; and have it be legal and moral, unlike the life 500 years  <br/>\nago of a 14 year old child bride who was quite literally given to her  <br/>\nhusband by her father and might have four children before she was (by  <br/>\ntoday&#39;s count) grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think giving a child something you have in exchange for him  <br/>\ndoing something he doesn&#39;t owe you to be bribery.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] kids and money","postDate":"1139909252","msgId":112042,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhiLjM2ODRkNjI5LjMxMjJmYzg0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":111921,"nextInTopic":112044,"prevInTime":112041,"nextInTime":112043,"topicId":111912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/10/2006 12:47:32 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
