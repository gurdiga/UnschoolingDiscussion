I do not think <br/>\nthis subject is enlightening about unschooling, but I am compelled as an <br/>\nactivist to address these things when they come up.  Please do delete this <br/>\nmessage if you are not interested in this topic.  So as not to continue <br/>\ntaking up the list&#39;s attention and time, I would like to invite anyone <br/>\ninterested in further debating or discussing this topic to contact me off <br/>\nlist.  Thanks very much for indulging me so far!  Here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the reading and research I have done, I am opposed to animal <br/>\nexperimentation on both scientific and ethical grounds. Scientifically, <br/>\nvivisection is a flawed methodology, as non-human animals are biologically <br/>\nand physiologically different from humans. Research on non-human animals <br/>\nall too often produces results that do not correlate to humans.  For <br/>\nexample, &quot; [T]he drugs Oraflex, Selacryn, Zomax, Suprol, and Meritol <br/>\nproduced such adverse side effects in humans (including death) that they <br/>\nwere removed from the market, though animal experiments had predicted all <br/>\nof them to be safe.  In fact, the General Accounting Office (the <br/>\ninvestigative arm of Congress) did a post-market study of drugs marketed <br/>\nbetween 1976 - 1985 and found that 52% were found to be more dangerous than <br/>\npre-market animal studies had indicated, with adverse side effects <br/>\nincluding permanent disability and death. Recently, the hepatitis drug <br/>\nFialuradine and the diet drug combination Phen-Phen cause serious injuries <br/>\nand deaths in humans because animal tests failed to show the potential for <br/>\ndanger. And for the past thirty years since the announcement of the war on <br/>\ncancer, our reliance on animal models has led to no advance in the life <br/>\nexpectancy of cancer patients in all but 2% of cases. In the last decade, <br/>\nthe National Cancer Institute abandoned their animal-based drug screening <br/>\nprogram and replaced it with non-animal alternatives because the animal <br/>\nmethods had been such a failure.&quot; (quoted from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm\">http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nEthically, I oppose vivisection based on the theory that animals have the <br/>\nright to live free of human-imposed suffering. &quot;People who base their <br/>\nargument against animal experiments on moral grounds are generally referred <br/>\nto as animal rights activists. Many people are confused by the term and <br/>\nthink that these people want equal rights for animals and humans. This is <br/>\nnot the case. Obviously, animals have different attributes and capabilities <br/>\nthan humans, but every sentient (having the ability to suffer) creature has <br/>\ninherent value and the right to a life free of being subjected to <br/>\nsuffering. So, while animal rights activists feel that animals should not <br/>\nbe subjected to painful experiments they do not feel that they should have <br/>\nthe right to vote or be able to drive a car.&quot;  (also quoted from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm\">http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s all!

I just can&#39;t let this go <br/>\nby without a response.  It absolutely does not pertain to unschooling, and <br/>\nfor this I humbly apologize.  But I feel passionate enough about this to <br/>\nrespond.  The animals have no voice, and they are suffering greatly for <br/>\nprofit (greed) and human gratification.  Please delete this if you&#39;re not <br/>\ninterested in this topic.  Here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it is certainly true that harsh realities can be experienced by <br/>\nanimals living in their natural environment (and this is true for humans, <br/>\nas well), animals FORCED by humans to perform in circuses are deprived of <br/>\ntheir precious freedom, their natural behaviors (like walking great <br/>\ndistances and nurturing their young), their natural social settings and <br/>\nfamilies, and are forced to travel in cramped cages and boxcars up to 48 <br/>\nweeks per year.  One may argue that the animals can live longer in <br/>\ncaptivity than they do in their natural setting, but what kind of life?  A <br/>\nlife of being shackled?  A life of physical and psychological stress, fear <br/>\nand confusion?  Many elephants that are forced to perform silly, unnatural <br/>\nand dangerous tricks suffer from painful arthritis and other chronic <br/>\ninjuries; yet, circuses are reluctant at best to retire them.  All this for <br/>\ngreed and human gratification.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne may also argue that seeing the animals is an educational <br/>\nexperience.  But, &quot;Animals used in circuses, and other displays, do not <br/>\nserve as accurate educational tools for children. These displays do not <br/>\neducate the public on the natural habitat, life-style, or behavior, but <br/>\nrather provide an erroneous perception of the animals. The circus may <br/>\nportray the animals as approachable and playful, however these wild animals <br/>\nare often dangerous, unpredictable and uncontrollable. Thus, children may <br/>\ndraw near or attempt to pet the animals under the often mistaken belief <br/>\nthat it is safe.&quot;  (Quoted from  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm\">http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nMake no mistake about it, circus trainers must use cruel beatings and fear <br/>\nin order to get wild animals to perform unnatural, dangerous acts like <br/>\njumping through hoop of fire.  These kinds of training techniques have been <br/>\ndocumented on undercover video tapes which I have seen.  I have seen and <br/>\nheard one famous circus&#39;s head elephant trainer admonish that the hidden <br/>\nbeatings must be severe because the elephants cannot be hit &quot;in front of a <br/>\nthousand people.&quot;  They use sharp bullhooks called an ankus, a wooden stick <br/>\nwith a sharp pointed hook at the end.  Trainers are instructed to &quot;sink&quot; <br/>\nthe hook, making elephants scream in pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven the minimum standards of the already weak and hard-to-enforce federal <br/>\nAnimal Welfare Act are not met, resulting in slaps on the wrist and <br/>\npayments of fines to &quot;settle&quot; charges.  But the real cost is the <br/>\nimprisonment, suffering, and injury of innocent animals whose only crime is <br/>\nthat they are animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said earlier, while nature can certainly deal out harsh situations, <br/>\nthese are usually events, except in the case of severe prolonged <br/>\ndrought.  Animal performers in circus acts are subjected to systematic, <br/>\nchronic conditions that include pain, cramped living quarters, and <br/>\nsometimes in poorer, smaller circuses, inadequate access to food and <br/>\nwater.  The animals cannot walk away from these situations, either.  And, <br/>\nthese incredibly social animals do not have the loving support of their <br/>\nfamily groups, as they do in the wild.  Young animals are snatched from <br/>\ntheir mothers prematurely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany localities have outright banned animal acts.  Rebellious wild animals <br/>\nhave caused injury and death to audience members and people in the <br/>\ncommunity.  &quot;Since 1990 these incidents have resulted in 43 human deaths, <br/>\nmore than 140 human injuries, and the killing of 69 big cats. These wild <br/>\nanimals are responding to the harsh conditions and stressful environment of <br/>\nthe circus. Elephants in circuses are rebelling in attempts to escape their <br/>\nsad existences.  In 1994, officer Blayne Doyle, who had to shoot 47 rounds <br/>\ninto...an elephant who charged out of the Great American Circus arena, <br/>\nlamented: &#39;I think these elephants are trying to tell us that zoos and <br/>\ncircuses are not what God created them for. But we have not been <br/>\nlistening.&#39;&quot;  (Quoted from  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm\">http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the animals cannot talk to us, there is plenty of research to support <br/>\ntheir intelligence and sentience.  Animals care about their own lives and <br/>\nthe lives of their young, as we do, and they can suffer.  Humans have a <br/>\nknowledge of when they are inflicting suffering.  Suffering is <br/>\nsuffering.  What the animals are forced to endure is nothing short of slavery.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an additional link to an article about the unnatural plight of <br/>\nperforming circus animals.
