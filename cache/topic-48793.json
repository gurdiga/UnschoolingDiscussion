She is doing it on her own, with a little bit of help from me and<br/>\nher dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe says, &quot;what is this word&quot; and we tell her.  She says &quot;this word<br/>\nsays  p hon ee,&quot; we say, &quot;close, good sounding out&quot; and we tell her the<br/>\nsound p and h make when they are together and how an e on the end of the<br/>\nword changes the vowel sound.  That&#39;s our teachable moment and then we<br/>\nlet it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can read very simple words without help now, something she is doing<br/>\non her own without us sitting her down and making her go through<br/>\nworkbooks (friends keep trying to loan us 100 easy steps to reading - or<br/>\nwhatever it&#39;s called - I keep saying thanks, but we&#39;re doing fine<br/>\nwithout it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7 1/2 yo is not interested in learning yet (although I suspect he<br/>\nknows more than he cops to).  When he&#39;s ready to start asking, we&#39;ll be<br/>\nhere to answer the question, not to sit him down and make him work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is they will learn.  If you read to them, show them that it is<br/>\nfun, and if you read for pleasure or information yourself they will pick<br/>\nit up and teach themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read every night for at least an hour (we&#39;ve only missed a few and I<br/>\nfeel guilty for that!) since our first was new born.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep it up, it works - I&#39;ve seen the grown up proof!<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48740,"nextTopicId":48796}}
