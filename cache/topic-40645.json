BTW, does unschooling.com ever update their <br/>\nsite? <br/>\nIt seems like it has been forever since something new has been there.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLovely weather, and large!<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I tell you about the time...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  Here, read this:<br/>\n[but first I must say that Marty and Kirby AND Holly are out right at this <br/>\nmoment, still, with Carol&#39;s kids (named below from the time Marty was just <br/>\nturning two) because it is the 18th birthday of the twins who are in the <br/>\nmiddle of that unschooling-always family]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJanuary 23, 1991<br/>\nMarty’s speech is really coming on.  He says “K.O.” for okay, and this <br/>\nmorning he said (not clearly, but certainly) “soda” and then “coke (toke)”, <br/>\n“I hungry,”  “food” and yesterday he pointed at the picture on some <br/>\nshredded wheat and said “trix.”   He’s turned down nursing in favor of other <br/>\ndrinks lately, and that’s great.  He has some cute own-words, notably <br/>\n“ching-ching” for a sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanuary 30, Carol’s kids came over and as each took a coat off, Marty would <br/>\ntake the coat and put in on the floor in the hall and go back for another <br/>\none.  When they’d hand him the coat he’s say “tant too” (thank you) on his <br/>\nway to deposit it.  Chris didn’t take his own coat off, and so Marty started <br/>\ntrying to take it off him.  When it was off, Marty took it, put in on the <br/>\npile, and came back, brushing his hands together like the job was all done.<br/>\n<br/>\nFebruary 2   When Kirby was at Michael’s spending the night, Marty went with <br/>\nus to Lance’s to a Rocky Horror party.  He slept through most of the first <br/>\nshowing but was wide awake for the second one.  We took turns dancing with <br/>\nhim and distracting him, and during the axe scene I tried to turn him away <br/>\nand cover him up in a funny way, but he twisted around with all his might and <br/>\nheld my hand away and watched.  It was kind of funny, how determined he was <br/>\nto see it.  He thought the songs were good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeb 3, Keith offered to keep Tyler while Karen went to a movie with Mark.  <br/>\nMarty was kind of jealous, but not nearly as bad as Kirby used to be.  Keith <br/>\ntook Marty and Tyler for a mile-long stroller walk.  Earlier that morning <br/>\nMarty had said “I need Jacket” while he was trying to go out into the back <br/>\nyard.  He needed more than that, because he was still in his pajamas, but it <br/>\nwas cute, and clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeb 10, Marty was sick and saying “ow” and  when I said what hurts he was <br/>\nsaying “chin, chin,” and pointed to his throat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while now he’s had a good concept--HOLE.  A scabbard is a hole, a <br/>\nholster is a hole, the box something goes in is its hole.  “Hole hole hole” <br/>\nmeans to put something where it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now Marty is 13.  Makes his own decisions a lot of the time.  Decided to <br/>\ngo see &quot;Signs,&quot; and then decided to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. to sleep with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after a full day of meet at library in neighboring town, go see Julie <br/>\n(Carol&#39;s youngest) in dance recital in OTHER town, watch a video, meet back <br/>\nin Albuquerque for dinner at a restaurant (this all a batch of ten teens or <br/>\nso, all but one homeschooled), Holly wanted to go with them to the dinner, <br/>\nand they agreed.  Not enough seat belts on the way there, though, though she <br/>\ncould get a ride back.  I asked Keith/dh if he wanted to go there, buy me a <br/>\ndrink, hang out, and we could bring Holly back... if the boys didn&#39;t mind.  <br/>\nMarty said &quot;I don&#39;t mind you being there, I just don&#39;t think it would be cool <br/>\nif you came over to the table to tell me and Kirby to stop doing something we <br/>\nwere doing or to tell us how to act.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nOH HUH!  Like I would do that...<br/>\nWell...  <br/>\nSo we didn&#39;t go, I just drove Holly there and let her out with her brothers <br/>\nwho had ridden in an all-full car.   And that was three and a half hours ago. <br/>\n I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine.  There are two cellphones in the group, and three <br/>\nlocal houses where they could be, and a cheap video arcade near there, and <br/>\nthe birthday celebration isn&#39;t over.<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, long day.  I should go to sleep now!
