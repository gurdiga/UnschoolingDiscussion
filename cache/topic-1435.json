The Independent Study Programs are just one<br/>\n(or two) ways of doing it.  The ISP can be a public school ISP, either<br/>\nyour own district or if you can get approval another district.  We<br/>\nalso have a number of private charter ISPs who operate statewide.<br/>\nSuccess of unschooling with either ISP program is dependent upon<br/>\none&#39;s supervising teacher (for public school ISPs) or facilitators<br/>\n(for the private ISPs).  Another option exists which I did not<br/>\nsee you mention - that is to file an R-4 affidavit.  This is an<br/>\naffidavit which states that you are running a private school so then<br/>\nthe homeschool is subject to regulations for private schools.  This<br/>\nis the way I will do it when I reach that point (in 2 years).  My<br/>\nchildren are under the age of compulsory attendance.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information check out Homefires webpage<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homefires.com\">http://www.homefires.com</a>  There is an email list for northern CA<br/>\non onelist called CAhomeschool; I&#39;m sure there is something for southern<br/>\nCA too.
