We meet at a wonderful local <br/>\nbeach around late morning of the first day of school.  Not only is it a <br/>\ngreat chance to re-connect with home learners we haven&#39;t seen for a while, <br/>\nit&#39;s also great for newbies.  They get a chance to see a lot of kids and <br/>\nparents who seem pretty normal.  They get to see a lot of kids of all ages <br/>\nmostly getting along well.  Even though my teen doesn&#39;t like going anymore, <br/>\n*I* still go.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma *","from":"&quot;zenmomma *&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Not-Back-To-School","postDate":"1029271931","msgId":40953,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMHhXd2xGU1RGNHI0clBLbE4wMDAxMTkwMEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40981,"prevInTime":40952,"nextInTime":40954,"topicId":40953,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
