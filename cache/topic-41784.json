I get shivers down my <br/>\nspine just thinking of the history of this seemingly insignificant item in my <br/>\nhands. Who read it? What were they like? Did Olga enjoy the gift of Lorna <br/>\nDoone that Edith gave her?<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great way to think about time periods and the goings ons of that time.<br/>\nI have the Cook and Peary versions of finding the North Pole...before the <br/>\nwhole debate began raging. It was still the 1800&#39;s.<br/>\nI have this adorable book that reflects the views of men on women...fable <br/>\nstyle, very funny, from the early 1900&#39;s. It has this fabulous picture of the <br/>\nauthor and everything. I love it.<br/>\nFunny how books can do so much for some of us, especially the really old <br/>\nones. I hope to have a wonderful collection to sit back and enjoy along with <br/>\nmy memories of unschooling one day.....<br/>\nIf you ever come across a decent first edition of the First Jungle Book, <br/>\nplease let me know Helen.
