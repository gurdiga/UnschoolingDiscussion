There are a lot of people who have kids who really don&#39;t have any clue about being parents, and aren&#39;t prepared or willing to make parenting a full-time job. There&#39;s a lot of &quot;expertitis&quot; going around, telling these already uncertain folks that they aren&#39;t up to the job, and should leave it to &quot;the professionals&quot; -- schools, mainly.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo why do they have kids? One of the strongest reason, I think, is that society pushes the &quot;fulfillment&quot; bit, as if all women have to be mommys, and all men have to be daddys. Some of these folks don&#39;t like kids. But they have them, because, well, that&#39;s what people do.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to sneer at parents who seemed totally inept and proud of it. Now I tend to wonder if maybe they wouldn&#39;t have been happier if society had said, &quot;Go do something else with your life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy McVicker<br/>\n<br/>\nwho likes kids, even noisey ones<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Parents would say all the time that <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t have the patience to work there.  And they meant it.  And I <br/>\nthink the people who say they wouldn&#39;t have the patience to homeschool really <br/>\nmean it, too.  Some people really are happy and relieved to see their kid get <br/>\non the bus in September.  And some people are really glad they don&#39;t have <br/>\nkids at all.<br/>\n  Personally, I loved being surrounded by children all day.  And now I love <br/>\nspending all day with my own child.  And both situations do take patience, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m a very patient person.<br/>\n  And I&#39;m mighty glad I got the internet when I did, because I learned about <br/>\nhomeschooling, and later unschooling, just in time.  That kindergartener&#39;s <br/>\nmom could&#39;ve been me.  Homeschooling was for disruptive kids, a last resort <br/>\nbefore juvenile detention (or so I thought).  What I learned astounded me.  <br/>\nAnd I did have to make some changes, like quit a long standing, fun, decent <br/>\npaying job.  But staying home with my son is one of the best things I ever <br/>\ndid. <br/>\n  And, at least around here, homeschooling seems to be a secret that nobody <br/>\ntalks about.  So maybe if we talk about how good it&#39;s going, and other kids <br/>\nwant to be home (or un)schooled, they can pester their parents.  Maybe some <br/>\nof those parents  can check their options, search their souls, and take the <br/>\nleap.  Maybe some more children can benefit from a superior (IMO) form of <br/>\neducation/life.<br/>\nMary J</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42325,"nextTopicId":42516}}
