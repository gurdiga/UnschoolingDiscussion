In some ways, an eccentric is the flip side<br/>\nof the neurotic -- the neurotic can be highly insecure<br/>\nwith feelings of inferiority, while the eccentric<br/>\ncelebrates his or her originality with no regrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe eccentric people who participated in Dr. Weeks&#39;<br/>\nstudy also scored very well on IQ tests, where they<br/>\nended up among the highest 15 percent of the general<br/>\npopulation.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Eccentrics are healthier because they are happier,&quot; <br/>\nDr. Weeks explains. &quot;Stated simply, eccentrics<br/>\nexperience much lower levels of stress because they do<br/>\nnot feel the need to conform, and lower stress levels<br/>\nmean their immune-response systems can function more<br/>\nefficiently.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you feel like walking around in a raincoat on<br/>\nthe hottest day of the year, or joining the Polar Bear<br/>\nClub, or shaving half your beard off while studying<br/>\nunder-water basket weaving, go for it! You are not<br/>\ncrazy, you are &quot;eccentric,&quot; which as it turns out is<br/>\nvery healthy indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nPrepared by Stephen Tunney for Dreamlife<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
