Why not check it out?<br/>\nIndiana Tami<br/>\n<br/>\nThirteen Eeeko-Halloween Decorations<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow are thirteen suggestions for Halloween decorations you can make <br/>\nwith reused and recycled items. If buying decoration materials, try <br/>\nusing non-petroleum based and/or recycled products with minimal <br/>\npackaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nSPIDERS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of buying plastic, petroleum based spiders, make fake spiders <br/>\nand cockroaches out of rocks, pipecleaners, and paint. Collect rocks, <br/>\npaint them black, and use non-toxic, water-based 3D fabric paint for <br/>\neyes. Attach and wrap pipe cleaners around the rock and leave enough <br/>\nhanging off the edge to bend into legs. Paste these spiders to <br/>\neverything! <br/>\n<br/>\nTake old string and paint it with non-toxic, glow-in-the-dark paint <br/>\nto make a spider web. <br/>\n<br/>\nDINNERWARE AND CENTERPIECES<br/>\n<br/>\nPlates/Utensils/Glasses<br/>\nTo save trees and petroleum, avoid using plastic and paper plates, <br/>\ncups and utensils. Instead, use real plates, or ask guests to bring <br/>\ntheir own, perhaps with a theme matching their costumes. For example, <br/>\nif a guest dresses as Mother Earth, he/she might bring a real plate <br/>\nwith a floral design. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlack, Red, and Orange Candles<br/>\nConventional candles are often petroleum based. Pure Beeswax candles <br/>\nset an eco-friendly Halloween mood, and the natural smell is mellow <br/>\nand compelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCreepy Crawly Vases<br/>\nGlue spiders (see above) and Halloween shapes cut from fabric or <br/>\npaper onto glass vases, mason jars, or plastic or terra cotta <br/>\nflowerpots. Place big, dried twigs in the pots, and hang more spiders <br/>\nfrom the twigs. One can even attach doll heads, or other doll body <br/>\nparts found lying around the home. Adding cleaned and dried animal <br/>\nbones (chicken, steak, etc.) also looks scary. <br/>\nSKELETONS AND SCARY PEOPLE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCardboard Skeleton<br/>\nTo avoid buying conventional plastic or virgin wood-based paper <br/>\nskeletons, make one with old cardboard or posterboard, using an <br/>\nanatomy or Halloween craft book for guidelines. Paint the skeleton <br/>\nwith non-toxic, glow-in-the-dark paint. Put a hat, some feathers, or <br/>\nspiders on its head for decoration. <br/>\n<br/>\nScary Stuffed Guy<br/>\nMake a scary person by stuffing old clothes with newspaper, and use <br/>\nan old mask (from goodwill or your attic) for a face. Splatter non-<br/>\ntoxic, water-based red paint on the figure to make him scarier, and <br/>\nstick a knife in him somewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nOTHER EFFECTS<br/>\n<br/>\nHanging Tin Lanterns: <br/>\nUsed tins (soda cans, olive oil tins, large tomato sauce tin) make <br/>\ninteresting hanging lanterns. Cut faces into the tins with a strong <br/>\nknife. Glue a beeswax candle in the bottom with a glue gun. Poke <br/>\nholes near the lid of the tin and thread a metal wire through to hang <br/>\nthe lanterns. <br/>\n<br/>\nVampire Repellant:<br/>\nHang garlic and crosses outside your front door. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbandoned Building:<br/>\n<br/>\nBoard up windows with old plywood or cardboard painted like wood. <br/>\nAttach spiders and maybe some green slime.<br/>\n<br/>\nCover furniture with white sheets and place ghosts (made of sheets <br/>\nand pillows) on them. Splatter nontoxic red ink or paint on the <br/>\nsheets for the &quot;fresh blood&quot; look.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuspend old sheets or gauzy fabric from trees to look like ghosts. <br/>\nHave a small radio in or next to a tree playing strange sounds (e.g. <br/>\nsomeone screaming, moaning, or rattling chains). If using batteries, <br/>\nmake sure they are rechargeabl e.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite scary messages backwards on the windows and/or mirrors with bar <br/>\nsoap or lipstick.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake vines and drape them around the room. <br/>\nGraveyard: Use handmade gravestones to make a graveyard outside your <br/>\nhouse. Make gravestones with large rocks, old cereal boxes, or big <br/>\npieces of used styrofoam (do not buy it!) that you have shaped with a <br/>\nsharp cutting tool. Paint the gravestones gray with a nontoxic, water-<br/>\nbased paint, and write guests&#39; names on them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26921,"nextTopicId":26923}}
