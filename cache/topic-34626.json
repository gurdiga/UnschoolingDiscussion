You may step back and view the entire world—not just your <br/>\nhome, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth—as a procovery-oriented <br/>\nlearning experience, a laboratory containing medicines, therapies, <br/>\nstrategies, sources of support, ways to heal and to grow, and ideas without <br/>\nend. Although collections of these treasures have been located in hospitals <br/>\nand clinics for your convenience, they are to be found in prayer, bubble <br/>\nbaths, animals, sunsets, snowfall, romance, music, art, mathematics, physics, <br/>\nengineering, foods, and everywhere else, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis authorizes you to experiment; to make mistakes; to try new things and to <br/>\n“backslide”; to passionately embrace that which energizes, inspires and <br/>\nheals you, no matter how “outside” of the medical model it may be; and to <br/>\naccept that you are the world’s greatest authority on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are entitled to build and create new dreams, and view them as a force as <br/>\npowerful as medicine. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis authorizes you to trust that procovery is possible for all individuals; <br/>\nthat healing a life can heal an illness; that there are infinite ways to in<br/>\nitiate and promote healing no matter how grave the illness and no matter how <br/>\nserious the limitations of systems and symptoms; and that hope is a life <br/>\nforce in and of itself.  To trust that there are as many paths to wellness as <br/>\nthere are to illness and that supporting individual paths to procovery will <br/>\nultimately result in mass and lasting change not only in individuals but also <br/>\nin health care systems. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have leave to Just Start Anywhere. Today. <br/>\n<br/>\nEach person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>\nprivileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>\ncreating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>\nobtain approval in order to experiment, to move toward procovery, to think, <br/>\nor to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need <br/>\npermission in the first place. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI found it looking for the other one.<br/>\nI don&#39;t even know what procovery IS! <br/>\n(Back to google.com, since I can&#39;t get on their main page.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one&#39;s at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.procovery.com/resource-certificate.htm\">http://www.procovery.com/resource-certificate.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34635,"nextTopicId":34705}}
