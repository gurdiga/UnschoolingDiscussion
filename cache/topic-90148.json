Shakespeare <br/>\nreally shouldn&#39;t be READ----it should be experienced. Films and plays are a <br/>\nbetter way of experiencing Shakespeare. Same for Tennesee Williams! There are <br/>\nmany ways to experience literature. Required readings in my high school were Lost <br/>\nHorizons, One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest (you can discuss the diffferent <br/>\nendings), The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1984, A Clockwork Orange, Shakespeare, .... <br/>\nyou get the picture. The PICTURE! &lt;g&gt; Three are also books on tape. We prefer <br/>\nthe movies. Movies and TV and documentaries can also cover &quot;history&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSC also requires composition. Define composition!<br/>\n<br/>\nArt is a composition. So&#39;s music. So&#39;s supper!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what they MEAN, but there&#39;s nothing that says I need to use a school <br/>\ndefinition of that word. I compose ALL the time. The conference was a major <br/>\ncomposition! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nCameron writes, directs, film, edits, and COMPOSES mini-films. I don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider the screen-play the composition. I define the WHOLE thing as a composition. <br/>\nHis drumming and guitar playing are compositions. His regular posting on <br/>\nmessage boards is composition.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless PA specifically defines the words, I figure you can be quite creative! <br/>\n<br/>\nI admit to not knowing the law in PA, but at 15, he would probably be mature <br/>\nenough to understand the ramifications and be willing to write *something* <br/>\ndown for you if it meant that he could keep unschooling! He could read a book or <br/>\nwatch a movie, you could both discuss it while the tape recorder was running, <br/>\nand you/he could transcribe his words into a &quot;discussion paper&quot;.  You could <br/>\ntogether learn Haiku and write a few poems. I&#39;m guessing the state just wants a <br/>\nfew examples per year. At 15, maybe he&#39;d be willing to give you a few (if <br/>\nyou&#39;re not willing to move! &lt;BWEG&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166495566,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"rooh_","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Need suggestions","postDate":"1075846500","msgId":90222,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDkwMWMzZWFhMyQyYzJiNzQ0MCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNzgwMWMzZWEyMyQzZjYyNTYzMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPiA8MDBmMDAxYzNlYTY4JGM4NmZlMmUwJGZkMDBhOGMwQEplbm55Pg=="},"prevInTopic":90209,"nextInTopic":90384,"prevInTime":90221,"nextInTime":90223,"topicId":90148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve got the evaluator problem already solved.
