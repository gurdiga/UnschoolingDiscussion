The thing that got me was so <br/>\nmany skirts and long hair and not a stitch of make-up.. That is usually how <br/>\nyou can easily identify the strong fundamentalist Christian women around <br/>\nhere.  They look like they walked off the Mayflower.    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna had  friend who was a in a fundy family.   As soon as the girl got away <br/>\nfrom her mother ( like a sleepover or play date at a friends house) the first <br/>\nthing she done was to change out of her long skirt into some borrowed clothes <br/>\nfrom her friends..   Her hair was so long and straggly.. split ends and dried <br/>\nout.   Every time Anna got a hair cut, this girl would beg her not to.. beg <br/>\nher to grow it out.  It made Anna feel bad because her friend just wanted <br/>\nsomeone to be like her.. But, Anna still got her hair cut.   One time this <br/>\ngirl got in trouble at school ( she had a TERRIBLE temper).. and she cried <br/>\nand told her friends that she would probably have to get baptized again <br/>\nbecause she had sinned so badly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The little girl loved to come to our house.. She would often tell Anna how <br/>\nbeautful she thought I was.. LOL. Yeah, right, I am 5&#39;3&quot; tall and weigh 250 <br/>\npounds.. But, I style my hair if I want to, I wear make-up if I want to, and <br/>\nI might get dressed up in a short skirt, hose and heels.  Her mother is a <br/>\nlovely 5&#39;1&quot; and barely weighs 100 pounds.. She is naturally very beautiful <br/>\nwith long ( of course) black hair and shining brown eyes and a wonderful <br/>\nsmile.  But you wont see her with anything more than a ponytail for a <br/>\n&quot;hairstyle&quot;  NO make-up, and no hemline above her knees. She downplays her <br/>\nbeauty, even tries to hide it. And, she &quot;trains&quot; her daughter to do the same. <br/>\n  Funny thing, when her daughter gets the chance, she puts on the most racy <br/>\noutfits she can find and flirts with the boys like mad.. Imagine that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I know all about fundamentalists.  I KNOW them.  I know that the mother <br/>\nof this family beat her 15 year old son with a belt buckle and she broke all <br/>\nof his collectibles because he was &quot;idolizing&quot; them. Yes, its horrible.

They DO want to isolate their children and give <br/>\nthem a skewed version of life.  There are scads of Christian books, <br/>\nbiographies written from a Christian point of view (no huge foul there), <br/>\nscience books written to support the Bible (starts to get questionable, in my <br/>\nmind), history books with just flat out falsehood and with a framework of the <br/>\nfuture written in which isn&#39;t supported by writings of the time, but just by <br/>\nthe time-travel wishes of the authors.  There is at least one Christian piano <br/>\nlessons course, and for a while there were advertisements for a Christian <br/>\nBible.  And by Christian, I mean fundamentalist Christian.  I saw some of the <br/>\ndefinitions in a review once, and I REALLY wish I had bought one.  &quot;Saved&quot; <br/>\nwas defined the regular ways AND as being born again.  Various things were <br/>\ndefined straight up as &quot;a sin against God in which...&quot; and that way.  Other <br/>\nreligions were defined in the worst possible light.   It was a dictionary for <br/>\nfundamentalist Christian homeschoolers to use which would keep them from <br/>\nbeing exposed to other people&#39;s definitions of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nCultural awareness and political correctness are hooted down HARD by the <br/>\nChristian Homescooling movement.  They don&#39;t want to teach their children <br/>\ncompassion and acceptance of other cultures.  Not even compassion and <br/>\nawareness of other religious denominations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd health and sex ed?  FORGET it.  Many of them define flirting and dating <br/>\nright up there with adultery, and only allow arranged marriages or *maybe* <br/>\ncourtship.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne curriculum has separate tracks for girls and boys, so that the girls are <br/>\nnot even given the same Christian Education the boys are, but are taught to <br/>\nbe Christian wives and mothers, to be good wives of boys whose education is <br/>\nsuperior to theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that what people against homeschooling think is going on with <br/>\nhomeschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they say it is happening, they will be telling the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kids are taught to fear other information as coming from Satan, so how <br/>\nwill they be rescued from that subgroup?

If fossils seem <br/>\nolder than 6000 years, that&#39;s because Satan MADE them seem older.
