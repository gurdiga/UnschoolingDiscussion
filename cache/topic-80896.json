Sandra, you are a bit mistaken....All of the examples you gave are people who should change because they are hurting other people(not to please others)! Breaking glass, pissing and defacating on public property, disrespectful teachers, muggers, drunk drivers, wife beaters are all behaviours that hurt others. A mother breastfeeding in public (which rarely ever gives more than a glimpse of a breast)is not injuring anyone and others can simply just vote with their necks(look the other way). In no way can these behaviors be compared.<br/>\nLoving the dialogue, Christine<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra answered<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There is no reason to be discreet, other than so somebody with 19th <br/>\ncentury morals won&#39;t shocked.  I live my life and I don&#39;t <br/>\nchange to please anybody.  If someone is doing something I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike, I don&#39;t expect them to change for me either.  People are who <br/>\nthey are, and they do what they do, and that&#39;s OK with me.  Nobody <br/>\nshould need to change to please someone else.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds good, like it would have a soaring soundtrack, but I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit&#39;s honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet there are people you don&#39;t think should break their vodka bottles at <br/>\nthe playground and then piss on the swings.  You probably would want them to <br/>\nchange, whether they&#39;re doing it while you&#39;re watching or when you&#39;re asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey really should change to please other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are teachers who are truly mean to kids.  They probably shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nteaching anymore, but over they years they&#39;ve just become coldhearted and <br/>\nsadistic.  Do you think they shouldn&#39;t change to please others?<br/>\n<br/>\nMuggers?<br/>\n<br/>\nDrunk drivers?<br/>\n<br/>\nWife beaters?<br/>\n<br/>\nRapists?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80888,"nextTopicId":80950}}
