All kids get confused and the length of time they stay <br/>\nconfused varies, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne trick dyslexia specialists use is cursive writing. Have the child <br/>\nlearn what the letter looks like written in cursive, show them <br/>\ntrouble words written in cursive. If it&#39;s a simple matter of <br/>\nmemorizing, they will memorize how it is spelled and be able to &quot;see&quot; <br/>\nit when it is printed. This may be more helpful to an older reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nConfusing &#39;p&#39; and &#39;q&#39;...there are few words that a child will see in <br/>\nbooks at age 6 that start with &#39;pu&#39; so teach him that &#39;q&#39; is always <br/>\nfollowed by &#39;u&#39;.  When he&#39;s older, when he begins to notice more &#39;pu&#39; <br/>\nwords (&quot;hey I thought it was puppy, not quppy!&quot;) you will know that <br/>\nhe has made the distiction. (Those of you with 6 yr olds reading long <br/>\nchapter books -- keep it to yourself).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;d&#39; and &#39;b&#39; is more problematic. Writing the word &#39;double&#39; in <br/>\nlower case letters on a card helped. If my son could refer to the <br/>\ncard when ever the need arose, he could see the difference. While he <br/>\ndid confuse the letters for awhile, dyslexia showed up in a different <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH,<br/>\nLauri Polunsky</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8226888,"authorName":"the_clevengers","from":"&quot;the_clevengers&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Reading and dyslexia","postDate":"1047872207","msgId":61238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI1M2ZzZitib2U1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzE2LjA4MjQ0NC4xMjQwLjkuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61233,"nextInTopic":61247,"prevInTime":61237,"nextInTime":61239,"topicId":61208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
