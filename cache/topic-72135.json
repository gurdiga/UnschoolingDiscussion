When I think of it, it doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nbother me. My mom was always much older than my friends moms were. My mom<br/>\nwas the coolest mom and we always had a bunch of kids hanging out at my<br/>\nhouse. Well into high school even. My mom is 77 now and is very active and<br/>\ngreat with all my kids. You should see her play with the younger three,<br/>\nespecially in the pool!!! Age to me doesn&#39;t mean squat!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as relating, I never had that problem. When I was younger, I always<br/>\nhung out with much older friends. Like 10=20 years older. So now that I&#39;m<br/>\nhanging with younger friends, I guess it all falls into place. I kind of<br/>\ntake on the mom role and well that&#39;s fine with me. I don&#39;t look old and as<br/>\nTara says, I don&#39;t look like a mom. All of Tara&#39;s friends are pretty<br/>\nsurprised when they meet me. They think we&#39;re sisters. I guess that helps.<br/>\nJust being comfortable with who you are, and really loving yourself no<br/>\nmatter what shape or age makes getting along with others so much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105349452,"authorName":"Linda Siemsen","from":"&quot;Linda Siemsen&quot; &lt;lsiemsen2@...&gt;","profile":"melisande1442003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Older Moms","postDate":"1054743197","msgId":72135,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODkwMWMzMmFiNCQzNjk0NjJjMCQ1OTNhYmM0MkBEODBERkMyMT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72202,"prevInTime":72133,"nextInTime":72136,"topicId":72135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello!
