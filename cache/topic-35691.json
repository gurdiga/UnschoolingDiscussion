Avoiding the neighbors isn&#39;t an option for<br/>\n  us.  We live in Army housing, 18 apartments to a building, 26 buildings in<br/>\n  the complex.  There are 23 children in my building, 21 of whom are 6 and<br/>\n  under.  It&#39;s a zoo.  (BTW, my son is almost 6)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t schedule my son to only play with unschoolers; I haven&#39;t met any in<br/>\n  Germany yet.  I can&#39;t even just play with homeschoolers; there are only<br/>\n  about 10-15 families in the 1-hour radius that our homeschool support group<br/>\n  covers.  I believe all are school-at-home (I keep my mouth shut!).  And, the<br/>\n  only folks we see most days are military; my German is weak, and<br/>\n  homeschooling is illegal in Germany, anyhow.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son only likes to play with a few of the kids in the building, but they<br/>\n  create real problems sometimes.  I know they&#39;re constantly after my son<br/>\n  about why he doesn&#39;t go to school, why he reads so much, why he&#39;s so wierd<br/>\n  (he&#39;s very quiet, and doesn&#39;t often do what &quot;everybody&quot; is doing), etc.  We<br/>\n  reap problems from this often in the form of nightmares.  I keep him at home<br/>\n  a fair bit, and schedule activities out when possible (the Army doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  offer us much, and it&#39;s usually with the same kids.).  But I also worry the<br/>\n  child has to have friends!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ideas, anybody?  I have to go home in a month or so, and deal with it again!<br/>\n  &lt;sigh&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\n  brenda  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
