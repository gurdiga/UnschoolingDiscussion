He<br/>\ncan only use scissors right handed!!  I bought him left-hand<br/>\nscissors, and they don&#39;t work for him.  I think he is semi-ambi.<br/>\nAnyway, I say all that to say that I think it is important to not<br/>\nmake any kind of issue over it - they have to do what seems natural<br/>\nto them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sit facing him when we are working with paper and pencil work.<br/>\nHe is just 1st grade and prints - and for the most part has done<br/>\nwell in drawing his letters the &quot;proper&quot; way.  I gave him a printing<br/>\nguide that has the arrows showing the way to draw the letters, but<br/>\nleft it up to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is funny - my facing him while we work - I get mixed up which is<br/>\nmy right and left hand!!!  *grin*   Of course, maybe I can&#39;t blame<br/>\nthat for my own confusion - I am probably having some of those<br/>\n&quot;Senior moments&quot;!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5561,"nextTopicId":5568}}
