She went to Gladwynne Montessori. This was the first experience with \n<br>any type of Montessori. She actually enjoyed it and made friends, etc. but I \n<br>was not going to send her back there. I did not realize when I was checking \n<br>out schools for her that this area was probably one of the most wealthiest \n<br>around. I have nothing against wealthy people at all, but it was not a \n<br>situation I would have kept her in. What I did like about it was no testing \n<br>(except Standardized) or grades. However, it was a school and very \n<br>structured. She decided on her own to homeschool this year. . &nbsp;in fact, I was \n<br>quite shocked when she told me she would. SHe has told me during the year \n<br>this year about how she realizes now how that school was so stifling. . . \n<br>.having to do things at a certain time. . . needing permission to go to the \n<br>bathroom, etc. etc. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>I understand your wanting to have order, etc. but I think if you are really \n<br>interested in unschooling, you might want to check out Open Connections. \n<br>Email me privately if you would like phone number, etc. I would be happy to \n<br>talk &nbsp;with you about it.\n<br>\n<br>lovemary</span></blockquote></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"GeorganneD@aol.com","from":"GeorganneD@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FGZdFB01mqdYwYYK6HUFhXK1FnV3MpslkY4AeTKdwaMae69nrHENsofMyzduXPA3wQhL03UpOA7C","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lovemary","postDate":"987788681","msgId":19316,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY3Ljk0Y2E3ZDYuMjgxMWNmODlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19327,"prevInTime":19315,"nextInTime":19317,"topicId":19316,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome to the list!
