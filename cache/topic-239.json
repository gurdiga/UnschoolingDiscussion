Along the way we <br/>\nhave added a daughter in law and a grand-daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son started home education in the middle of his eigth grade year.  <br/>\nThe final straw was frustration over the school interfering in our home <br/>\nschedule...hubby worked out of town at the time and we wanted to take a long <br/>\nweekend and go visit him instead of waiting for him to get away to see us.  <br/>\nThe school, in their infinite wisdom, didn&#39;t think that was an appropriate <br/>\nreason to miss a day of school and informed us that if he wasn&#39;t in school he <br/>\nwould not be allowed to make up any work and would automatically fail all <br/>\nclasses.  So, we took back the reigns of his education and have never <br/>\nregretted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur youngest boy has never been to public school, except to support cousins <br/>\nby attending concerts and such.  I don&#39;t anticipate that changing.  We are <br/>\nvery happy with our decision to educate at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used more unschooling than anything regulated with the oldest.  It was a <br/>\nbit nerve wracking and I had to keep checking my gut to be sure it was the <br/>\nright decision for us.  It was often hard to see that any learning was <br/>\nactually happening.  Then the rascal decided to pass his GED on the first try <br/>\nwith no studying and having not participated in any sort of &#39;educational&#39; <br/>\nactivity for over 2 years.  So, now I&#39;m much more comfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there are days that I get compulsive or have friends/family members <br/>\nquestion what I&#39;m doing and why.

We have two children, Megan age 4 and<br/>\nAlex age 1.83333...  I have a grown child from my first marriage,<br/>\nJustin.  He&#39;s 24 and did/is still doing the traditional school<br/>\nthing -- he&#39;s a grad student at UC Santa Cruz working on his Ph. D.<br/>\nin astronomy.  He&#39;s been interested in astronomy since he was 4 BTW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t like the way schools were when Justin was in school and they&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten worse since then.  Rob and I had some long discussions about<br/>\nwhat we wanted for Megan and Alex.  We both independently reached<br/>\nthe conclusion that we would homeschool them.  Then I learned about<br/>\nunschooling and realized that was how we would live our life!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say I am a complete unschooler with bouts of anxiety from<br/>\ntime to time.  I have unschooled both Megan and Alex since birth.<br/>\nI also realize that I sort of unschooled Justin in that I (and his <br/>\nfather) supported his outside-of-school interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Sunnyvale, CA.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMegan currently attends a coop preschool.  I had some doubts about <br/>\nthis last fall.  She is very happy there; the program is very <br/>\nunstructured.  It&#39;s more like a park day with art projects, dress up<br/>\nclothes and music activities too.  We will be continuing that for<br/>\nnext year for her and probably for Alex too when he&#39;s old enough. <br/>\nThe main reason I utilize it is that I have had difficulty<br/>\nfinding a good support group with younger children involved.  We <br/>\nwent to one last summer but Megan ended playing with other children <br/>\nin the park rather than the homeschool group.  I couldn&#39;t justify<br/>\ninterrupting Alex&#39;s naptime when we could just go to the park at<br/>\nany old time and get similar results!
