Conversation reveals so much, yet those wheels are<br/>\nconstantly spinning and I wonder what they&#39;re piecing together.  Then<br/>\n&quot;BAM&quot; out they come with what was internally going on!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLately, my guys have been outwardly showing their interest in the<br/>\nwritten language.  They have both delved deeper into making sense of<br/>\nthe written word.  It&#39;s such fun to witness and participate in their<br/>\nprocesses.  They each have been making sense of this in their own<br/>\nindividual meaningful ways, yet they so complement one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentally travel back in time I recall them both visually, orally,<br/>\ntactilely taking in their new worlds.  Then, in terms of language,<br/>\nthere was the start of their coos and babbles, which eventually<br/>\nevolved into the utterances of first words.  This has developed into<br/>\nour current conversations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe process has included the time of recognition of symbols as we<br/>\ndrove places (Target, Jamba Juice) to familiar food labels in the<br/>\ngrocery and our home pantry.  I recall them both pointing out familiar<br/>\nletters while reading stories or seeing words while out and about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA while back my older son would flip through frequently read books and<br/>\ntell the story verbatim, and I mean verbatim!  The memory/recall<br/>\namazes me.  Goes to show that when something is important/meaningful<br/>\nit&#39;s internalized.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey both went through a time of stringing rows and rows and rowsof<br/>\nletters/numbers together on the computer and having dh or me &quot;read&quot;<br/>\nwhat they wrote.  They would crack up as we gave our best effort and<br/>\nread &quot;jibberish.&quot;    On occasion they&#39;ll write, but not all that<br/>\ninterested in putting pen/paint/crayon to paper for writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago, my younger one would point letters out and associate it<br/>\nwith a meaningful character to him (superheroes).  He would point to a<br/>\nletter B and say &quot;B for Batman&quot; &quot;N for Nightwing&quot;, I loved when he did<br/>\nS cuz he&#39;d say &quot;S for Superman, me and you, mom&quot;  His name is Seth and<br/>\nmine is Susan, so indeed S is for me and mom.  As a Star Wars fan he<br/>\nnow thinks it&#39;s neat that a letter switcheroo (e becomes i) turns Seth<br/>\ninto Sith!  Turning `mom&#39; upside to become `wow&#39; is pretty neat too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older one likes to play his self created trivia game where he will<br/>\ngive clues with letters such as Bionicle with a T (Tahu), Star Wars<br/>\njedi with an A (Anakin).    He now also will `read&#39; over my shoulder<br/>\ncommenting on familiar words he notices, such as his name or important<br/>\nwords in his world - primarily from all his gaming (play, ready,<br/>\nenter)  and he&#39;ll pull letters inquiring as to what something says.<br/>\nThere will be silence (those are the times I wonder what&#39;s cookin&#39; in<br/>\nthere) and he&#39;ll blurt out &quot;Is L for Lord?  Is V for Voldemort?&quot;  The<br/>\nother day he came up to me and said &quot;How do you spellno waitK is for<br/>\ncandy, isn&#39;t it?&quot;   Just today he says &quot;1-3, thirteen.  Hey, that has<br/>\na T like teenager&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThey both now have such a clear, strong recognition of letters and<br/>\nhave been into asking what things say by pulling the letters.  &quot;What&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;G-A-M-E-S-T-O-P?&quot;  My older one will pull phrases and say something<br/>\nlike &quot;What&#39;s T-H-E  space  E-N-D?&quot;   He notices and acknowledges the<br/>\nspaces between words.  I think that&#39;s cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night they were playing Lincoln Logs together when Seth made and<br/>\nX for X-Men.  Evan made the same configuration, held it at a different<br/>\nangle and said &quot;plus&quot;  They both put them down and said they were<br/>\nNinja stars.  Onto next activity<br/>\n <br/>\nIn wrapping up my long-windedness I just think the way this process<br/>\nplays out is so cool! The pieces are coming together in meaningful<br/>\nways for them.  It&#39;s not phonetically forced, doesn&#39;t have negative<br/>\nassociations  I watch/listen/play throughout the day and know my<br/>\nhappy, curious, energetic bundles of love would be completely<br/>\ndifferent beings if their impressionable selves were placed in the<br/>\nhands of the system.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112872,"nextTopicId":57002}}
