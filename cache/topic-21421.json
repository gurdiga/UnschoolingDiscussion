The only things I can <br/>\nthink<br/>\nof to do with disposable diapers and from what I have read, the study <br/>\nisn&#39;t<br/>\nconfirmed, but that they cause the temp. in the diaper to be 1 -2 <br/>\ndegrees<br/>\nhotter than cloth and therefore can cause low sperm count in baby <br/>\nboys.<br/>\nThen of course there is the environmental factors.  Most people who <br/>\nuse<br/>\ndisposable do not remove the b.m.&#39;s from the diaper when they throw <br/>\nthem<br/>\naway and they, along with the plastics, go to the land fills causing<br/>\npossible diseases or ground water contamination.  I used cloth for <br/>\nboth my<br/>\nkids with no problem.  I did occasionally use disposable but I felt <br/>\nreally<br/>\nguilty when I did.  Of course the cost was an issue too.  I have not <br/>\nheard<br/>\nof elemination timing but suspect that is what tribal people of <br/>\nAfrica might<br/>\nhave done.  I don&#39;t know how well it would work in this culture.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in Maine<br/>\nUnschooling mom to two beautiful daughters.<br/>\nwww.geocities.com/autonomousangela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21298,"nextTopicId":21424}}
