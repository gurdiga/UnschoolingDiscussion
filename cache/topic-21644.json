Most of the other families are presenting certificates and having their children do a piano piece, a song, a poem, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe, on the other hand, being our first year, have done little this year to &quot;present&quot; as *outward* achievements. (I have instead seen growth and maturity in my children (13 yr old son and 11 yr old daughter), plus an incredible family closeness, but that&#39;s another story...) (I have decided that next year we will probably not be a part of the recognition ceremony, but we are already on the program for this year.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like to do, and have started, is to present some &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; awards, like &quot;Perfect Attendance&quot; (like who misses a day when you are unschooling?) and &quot;Fewest Classes Attended&quot; along with &quot;Most Well-rested Student&quot; (my 11 yr old daughter likes her sleep!). I was hoping that some of you &quot;cheeky&quot; unschoolers may have a few ideas. My husband suggested &quot;Most Improved Surfing Skills&quot; (tv) and &quot;Excellence in Hand/Eye Coordination&quot; (video games). We also agreed on potentially using &quot;Attending Latest Class&quot; because my son and I went to Walmart and the grocery store at midnight one Friday night and had some of the most intense talks ever about a variety of subjects...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions are welcome....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nTerri   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21681,"nextTopicId":21685}}
