Those who have been granted an RE <br/>\ndo not have to comply with any of the home education statute, such <br/>\nas annual testing and annual notification.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe local school board reviews the application for the RE and does <br/>\nhave the legal right to deny such exemption if they feel your <br/>\nconviction is not genuine, nor is based upon a religious <br/>\nconviction.  A philosophical or ethical objection is not valid for <br/>\nan RE.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no deadline for filing for an RE.  You can file whenever <br/>\nyou have the letter ready.  In fact, some people never file for it, <br/>\nciting the fact that to initiate contact ackowledges the very <br/>\nauthority that they believe the state does not have.  However, <br/>\nbecause you have had a run-in with the police already, I would <br/>\nsuggest filing as soon as you have time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you choose not to file the RE, then you have 30 days from moving <br/>\nto VA to submit your NOI.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many on the VAEclecticHomeschool list who do homeschool <br/>\nunder the RE (I am one of them).  In fact, filing an RE was just <br/>\nrecently discussed, and several examples of letters requesting an RE <br/>\nwere posted.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Susan (wifetovegman)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] File Request to acknowledge","postDate":"1103062726","msgId":101580,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0MS4zYjM1YWRlMy4yZWYwYzBjNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101579,"nextInTopic":101587,"prevInTime":101579,"nextInTime":101581,"topicId":101579,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/14/04 3:15:40 PM, magdalenahansonn@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1185138512\">In a message dated 12/14/04 3:15:40 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:magdalenahansonn@...\">magdalenahansonn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; my understanding is that they have no legal ground to deny the <br/>\n<br/>\nexemption and wondered if anyone here had any personal experience <br/>\n<br/>\nwith this type of exemption. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be better handled on a statewide list than an international list.  <br/>\nI&#39;m glad there are people here who had some resource information for you.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this list, let&#39;s get back to unschooling topics and away from state laws.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":206927421,"authorName":"magdalenahanson","from":"&quot;magdalenahanson&quot; &lt;magdalenahansonn@...&gt;","profile":"magdalenahanson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"File Request to acknowledge","postDate":"1103059268","msgId":101579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNwbmxnNCs5ZHA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":101580,"prevInTime":101578,"nextInTime":101580,"topicId":101579,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From HSLD site:File request to acknowledge religious exemption with the local school board chairman So what we have to file is a request for the board to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1278140589\">From HSLD site:File request to acknowledge religious exemption with <br/>\nthe local school board chairman<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what we have to file is a request for the board to acknowledge a <br/>\nhomeschoolers religious exemption to the compulsary attendance law. <br/>\nWe did check the laws here before moving.
