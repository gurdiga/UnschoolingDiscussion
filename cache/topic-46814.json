Both of those things worked for her for those problems where <br/>\nthese were the consequences for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t help her. Not in the least. The repercussions were extreme and I <br/>\nfirmly believe I hurt more than I helped. I helped us at the time because <br/>\nshe was more obedient and quiet. She was not a happy kid and later it came <br/>\nback to haunt us all. I did what I thought was best at the time. I knew no <br/>\nbetter. I had two little ones at the time that were watching their older <br/>\nsisters every move. I just wanted her to stop before they started slamming <br/>\nand talking back fiercely too. When I know better, I do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnow why? Because I&#39;ve done it both ways. A lot of people responding have <br/>\nbeen homeschooling/unschooling since their kids were born or very little. My <br/>\noldest has always, even now been in the school system. My views on how <br/>\nchildren were to be treated has changed. I&#39;ve done it the wrong way and now <br/>\nthe right way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the others are only soon to be 8,7 and now 2, I don&#39;t see what I <br/>\ndid in my oldest even at these ages. When people say they don&#39;t see their <br/>\nkids doing those things at those ages, even though we can&#39;t ever really say <br/>\nfor sure, I believe them whole heartedly. It does make a difference in what <br/>\nwe do and how they react. I KNOW this to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s never too late. My oldest is almost 17 and every day we work on the <br/>\ndamage that&#39;s been done in the past. We&#39;re doing a great job. She&#39;s a great <br/>\nkid. A really great kid. And when I honestly let her know that every minute <br/>\nof the day, no matter how she was acting, she started to believe it too. <br/>\nWhen I started to show her the respect and consideration and trust I asked <br/>\nfor from her, I started to get it back. It didn&#39;t happen over night. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot easy to do. Sometimes we really don&#39;t see what we&#39;re doing wrong with <br/>\nour kids. We love them so much, we can&#39;t possibly think of what we feel is <br/>\nright is harming them. A lot does. Listen to what they are saying. Listen <br/>\nvery carefully. When the kids are feeling a certain way, it&#39;s because they <br/>\nare &quot;feeling&quot; it. We have no right to play that down by saying &quot;I&#39;m not&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;No you don&#39;t&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not true.&quot; It&#39;s what they really feel. Help them <br/>\nwith that. Read a book, read 10 books. You&#39;ve got some really good <br/>\nsuggestions for books here. Read them twice if you have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t punish her and don&#39;t make her decide what you should &quot;do&quot; with her. It <br/>\nmight help you now, it won&#39;t help her at all. Trust me on this one. My <br/>\ndaughter was close to losing it all because I didn&#39;t try hard enough to <br/>\nunderstand and really help her. Listen to what people are saying here. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what you&#39;ve heard off list, but I do hear what is being said <br/>\nhere.

One is the idea that if a child weans him or herself, he will <br/>\nhave quit exactly when he needed to, but if he&#39;s weaned against his will, he <br/>\nwill have remaining needs.  And if a mother lets a child be with her, right <br/>\nin her lap, riding on her back, sleeping with her, he will bravely go away <br/>\nmore easily than one who is always being sent away and being made to be alone <br/>\nto &quot;encourage independence.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t encourage independence, it creates a <br/>\ngap between parent and child.

Since my children are not <br/>\nemotionally needy, not trying to impress classmates or bullies, and they have <br/>\nways to get stuff when they need it, they&#39;re not doing those things,   They <br/>\nhave calm, strong identities.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir friend Eric goes to school and he&#39;s the only pierced-faced on in their <br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt; I am curious as to who <br/>\nruns your household, you or the children? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you&#39;re not curious.  You&#39;re insulting.<br/>\nYou&#39;re assuming children &quot;run our households.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat runs our household is a set of considerations:  Keeping a roof over our <br/>\nchildren&#39;s heads, providing them a safe and interesting life as far as we <br/>\ncan, being loving and compassionate within our means, etc.   When the people <br/>\nin the house have mutual goals and when they&#39;re helping each other accomplish <br/>\nsmaller personal goals, it doesn&#39;t look much like the traditional father as <br/>\nprincipal, mother as teacher, children as sinful grubs scenario that many <br/>\nstructured homeschooling families prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it&#39;s a different paradigm, questions about the OLD paradigm don&#39;t <br/>\ntranslate across very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; When they are adults, will they know how to deal with &quot;rules&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;restrictions&quot; in their job, or <br/>\nlife? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many grown unschoolers now.   They just keep coming!  My oldest is <br/>\nsixteen and has had the same job for two years.  He came in at 3:00 a.m. last <br/>\nnight, came to check on me, and went to sleep.  He has to be at work at 9:00. <br/>\n I asked my husband to check at 8:15 to make sure he was awake.  At 8:00, <br/>\nKeith came down and said Kirby was up already.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby has always loved rules.  Rules of games, procedures for remembering <br/>\nwhich kid&#39;s turn it was to sit in the front, or to go with dad alone to the <br/>\nstore, when they were younger and we had some little turn-taking things.   He <br/>\nis a really good teacher of the games at their store.  Once a week he teaches <br/>\nthe beginning kids&#39; class at the dojo where he&#39;s gone since he was nine.  He <br/>\nknows, respects, and passes on the rules for behavior in the dojo, the forms <br/>\nof the exercises, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is a really good host, when other kids are over.  He&#39;s thoughtful and <br/>\naware.  I remind him sometimes, checklist style, if he has overnighters to <br/>\nmake sure they know where bathrooms and breakfast foods are in case they&#39;re <br/>\nup first, and to make sure there are enough sheets and pillows out and <br/>\navailable for when they start dropping here and there on futons and couches.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is a rules fiend.  She wants rules followed to the letter.  She&#39;s just <br/>\nthat way.  She likes her little ponies lined up in some sensible (to her) <br/>\nfashion, and rearranges them periodically by how their manes are combed, or <br/>\nthe order she got them in, or those her cousin Gina has, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of natural restrictions on life.  Making them up would be <br/>\ncounter-productive to their living NOW in the real world.  School claims to <br/>\nprepare people for the real world,  My kids didn&#39;t need that preparation, <br/>\nhaving never &quot;left&quot; the real world to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Or will they just do what they please, never considering anyone else?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey never have done that before, so I can&#39;t imagine why they would start <br/>\nwhen they were grown.  They&#39;re very considerate.  Because they have been <br/>\nshown much consideration.  Because they live surrounded by consideration, <br/>\nthey think that is just how things should be between people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they lived surrounded by shame and false &quot;consequences&quot; they would learn <br/>\nto think that&#39;s how life should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;There will certainly be consequences when he tells his boss, &quot;I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends what the thing is and how he says it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby goes to staff meetings and almost always brings up something the boss, <br/>\nowner and manager had all overlooked in planning the meeting, or his <br/>\nbrainstorming proposals are taken and made into policy, or a Magic tournament <br/>\nis rearranged following his reminders about logistics and time constraints.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome jobs have yucky things a kid just might not be willing to do.  They can <br/>\nmake adult decisions about whether to negotiate, buck up, or just change <br/>\njobs.  They can make better adult decisions if they&#39;ve been making decisions <br/>\nall along.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I mentioned in an earlier posting that she is gifted, because she <br/>\nseems to have a problem with perfection.  Most everything comes very <br/>\neasily for her, so when something DOESN&#39;T - she flips. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPerfectionism isn&#39;t much of a gift.<br/>\nBeing called gifted is no gift at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; When she&#39;s practicing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even <br/>\nwhen it <br/>\nisn&#39;t perfect!)

Since most things come very easily for her, when <br/>\nsomething <br/>\n&gt; &gt; DOESN&#39;T, she doesn&#39;t know how to deal with it.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout <br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; on numerous occasions.  She agrees that because most things come <br/>\nso <br/>\n&gt; &gt; easily to her, she feels &quot;stupid&quot; when she can&#39;t do something.  <br/>\n&gt; Logic <br/>\n&gt; &gt; tells her she&#39;s not really stupid, but she&#39;s so frustrated at the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I think the most effective way to deal with it is to deal with <br/>\n&gt; the frustration rather than punishing. I&#39;m sure we all know <br/>\nfamilies <br/>\n&gt; with kids who have lousy relationships with their parents and <br/>\nthey&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; always &quot;grounded&quot;.  Their parents are always yelling at them.  They <br/>\n&gt; get punished a LOT.

She&#39;ll yell.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What if you stopped commenting?  What if, when you see her getting <br/>\n&gt; out the violin, you casually go do some project in another part of <br/>\n&gt; the house and let her to work out her violin frustrations herself?  <br/>\n&gt; If she comes looking for you and asking for help, then give it, but <br/>\n&gt; maybe she just needs to work this out for herself? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be <br/>\n&gt; bothered.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho <br/>\n&gt; hum.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve found that when it&#39;s something that directly affects my <br/>\n&gt; daughter, she&#39;s more than willing to help.  If she&#39;s having friends <br/>\n&gt; over, she&#39;ll clean up so they have a clutter free area to play.  If <br/>\n&gt; she wants to make a special meal and the measuring cup she wants is <br/>\n&gt; in the sink, she&#39;ll wash it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to be guilty of relying on her, as the oldest child, to run <br/>\n&gt; and do things for me all the time. She was my little errand girl.  <br/>\n&gt; Please run and get me a diaper for the baby.  Please go put this in <br/>\n&gt; the mailbox for me.  Please go get your brother a shirt.  Then I <br/>\nsat <br/>\n&gt; back (after reading a lot of posts on this list!) and thought about <br/>\n&gt; how I&#39;d feel in her situation.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now, if I&#39;m running late and one of the boys aren&#39;t dressed, I <br/>\n&gt; might say, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m really running late and he&#39;s not even <br/>\n&gt; dressed.  Do you have time to get me a shirt for him?&quot;  That&#39;s the <br/>\n&gt; same way I&#39;d ask my husband for help.  Very rarely does she turn me <br/>\n&gt; down, but once in awhile she&#39;ll say, &quot;Can you wait until I finish <br/>\n&gt; __________&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m kind of in the middle of a game&quot; or &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; SOOOO tired!&quot;  I&#39;m learning to accept it.  And I&#39;m trying not to <br/>\nask <br/>\n&gt; her to run and get me stuff unless I am really stuck or really <br/>\n&gt; overwhelmed.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also learning to often do things that she asks me to do.  Like <br/>\n&gt; today she has friends over and she was so excited and having such a <br/>\n&gt; good time.  She wanted some food warmed up and asked if I would do <br/>\nit <br/>\n&gt; for her and bring it to her.  There was a time when I would have <br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;You&#39;re capable of getting that yourself&quot;, but then I thought <br/>\n&gt; of all the times I was exhausted at the end of the day and asked <br/>\nher <br/>\n&gt; to go get me something because I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of <br/>\nwalking <br/>\n&gt; down the steps one more time.  I realized how important having <br/>\nthese <br/>\n&gt; friends over is to her and then happily got her the food and <br/>\nbrought <br/>\n&gt; it to her.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sheila </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112087015,"authorName":"luv2unskool","from":"&quot;luv2unskool&quot; &lt;cmr0523@...&gt;","profile":"luv2unskool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1035034892","msgId":46861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFvcm5lYytyMWFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5RDYzQkVCLjEwNTI5JWhvbWVtYW1hQGluZmluZXQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46859,"nextInTopic":46862,"prevInTime":46860,"nextInTime":46862,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When she s ... it ...

That is often the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reason.  &quot;Oh honey, would you put that in the trash instead of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; leaving it on the counter?&quot;  might result in stomping, or even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; yelling.  &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot; she&#39;ll rant.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Isn&#39;t asking her to do it for you (turn off the TV) the same as her <br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; wanting to do something (throw something away) to make your life <br/>\neasier?<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s where the Why do *I* have to always... comes from.

They are not to get angry or refuse.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Different kids have different personalities.  Some are <br/>\nmore &quot;strong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; willed&quot; than others.  Some are very agreeable to everything, mine <br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have both. My more agreeable child (ds13) gets tired of being ask<br/>\n&gt; sometimes. He tells me so and I try doing better myself. I try <br/>\nharder to not<br/>\n&gt; take advantage of him. Balance. It&#39;s hard sometimes but I try to be <br/>\nmore<br/>\n&gt; mindful of this and it works wonders.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My other ds (8yo) lets me know first that he doesn&#39;t want to. This <br/>\nsometimes<br/>\n&gt; set me off. We both get loud. That&#39;s were he has gotten this too. <br/>\nMy ds have<br/>\n&gt; not fallen far from the tree so to speak. I try to back off more <br/>\nand give<br/>\n&gt; him *all* the info of why I&#39;m asking. If I tell him my reasons <br/>\nfirst and not<br/>\n&gt; just ask or demand he is much more agreeable. Interupting his play, <br/>\nTV,<br/>\n&gt; activites is also a major factor too. I react the same. I really <br/>\nhave a hard<br/>\n&gt; time when anyone, including dh, interupting my reading and trying <br/>\nto absorb<br/>\n&gt; something.

From her parents and in herself. She is trying her <br/>\nhardest to<br/>\n&gt; sort all this out.

She will end up feeling more resentful and more angry. She sees her behaviour from an entirely different perspective, and I&#39;m quite sure from where she is looking, she does not need punishment. I&#39;ve never came across a child that feel punishment was fair and they deserved it. I did not endure many punishments as a child, but I do remember once, funny enough because my father thought I was disrespectful to my mother, and even though I probably was at the time, I still today feel he was wrong to punish me.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sounds angry, upset, and frustrated to me, and I think she might need some space. Space to be on her own, space to get upset without someone trying to make her feel better, space to be frustrated and work it through.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have to remember that our children do not act in isolation. They act and react to us. We live within a family system, where each part affects the next part. Her behaviour is a reaction to what she perceives from you, and you reacting to it, keeps it alive and going. I can see that with my children - whenever I&#39;m having a bad day, they react to me in a similar pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a nine year old, but I do have a nine year old niece, and I think this might not be the easiest age for them. Nine year olds are moving into a new development phase and they are enduring all kind of changes, that are bound to leave them frustrated and confused. I also believe some girls might experience hormonal increases and everyone know how difficult those hormones can make life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are two articles that you might find helpful<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nncc.org/Child.Dev/ages.stages.9y.11y.html\">http://www.nncc.org/Child.Dev/ages.stages.9y.11y.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nncc.org/Guidance/cc41_mad.scream.html\">http://www.nncc.org/Guidance/cc41_mad.scream.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck<br/>\n<br/>\nDalene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"&quot;Tia Leschke&quot; &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1035002599","msgId":46854,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMzQwMWMyNzcyZSRkMTlmYjFhMCQ0OTcxOGU4YkBlYnVzNDk+","referencesHeader":"PGFvcWVudSs4Mm51QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46853,"nextInTopic":46859,"prevInTime":46853,"nextInTime":46855,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe<br/>\nshe could spend one (short) practice period working on that bit where her<br/>\nfingers get all tangled up.  Does her teacher give her advice about<br/>\npracticing?  My first horn teacher didn&#39;t, and I never really knew *how* to<br/>\npractice.  My next teacher was very specific about practice techniques.  For<br/>\ninstance, for that bit where the fingers get all tangled up, take it slowly<br/>\nenough to play it perfectly, just one short section.  Make sure you start<br/>\nslightly before the hard part and go through to a little bit past it,<br/>\notherwise you get tripped up getting into and out of the passage.  Then<br/>\nspeed it up a little at a time.  Does she have a metronome?  I often work<br/>\nwith one, and just keep notching the speed up one click at a time.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to help her when she&#39;s frustrated, but I&#39;m not sure how.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be happy until she DOES play the song perfectly,<br/>\n&gt; so trying again seems the only option.  I have suggested she put it<br/>\n&gt; away for awhile, and try later (a fresh start), but she gets mad at<br/>\n&gt; that too.

Can you have these talks at some other<br/>\ntime?  Maybe when you&#39;re doing something else together, you could bring up a<br/>\nstory about how you sometimes get really frustrated when you&#39;re sewing or<br/>\nsomething like that.  Talk about how you&#39;ll keep going after one or two<br/>\nmistakes, but if you keep making mistake after mistake, you realize that<br/>\nit&#39;s time to take a break or quit for the day.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be bothered.<br/>\n&gt; Not wanting to contribute.

Are you sure she&#39;s aware that<br/>\nthat&#39;s what you&#39;re doing?  Do you ever talk about how hard some things are<br/>\nfor you, especially things that maybe look to her like they must be easy?<br/>\nHas she had a chance to experience the satisfaction of succeeding at<br/>\nsomething that took more effort than things usually do for her?  Maybe you<br/>\ncould look for opportunities for her to experience something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, not using punishments can look like the parents aren&#39;t doing<br/>\nanything, but in many ways it&#39;s harder.

A friend on another homeschooling list had<br/>\nthat problem with her daughter.  When the girl seemed unhappy and frustrated<br/>\nwith piano after a year or two, they made it clear that it was her choice to<br/>\ncontinue or not.  They mentioned off and on over several years that she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to play, that they wouldn&#39;t be disappointed.  She told them<br/>\nyears later that she didn&#39;t believe them, that she &quot;knew&quot; they wanted her to<br/>\ncontinue.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The violin was one example.

You could do something like describe<br/>\nhow that counter is going to look if everyone just leaves their trash on it.<br/>\nYou could have the pile heaped up all the way to the ceiling.  My point is<br/>\nthat it&#39;s up to you rather than her to change the tone of your interactions.<br/>\nShe&#39;s too young and inexperienced to be able to figure out how to change it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your various posts, I get the feeling that she doesn&#39;t *yet* have much<br/>\n&quot;emotional intelligence&quot;.  She doesn&#39;t know how to label, describe, and deal<br/>\nwith her strong emotions.  Something my daughter has done with her kids is<br/>\nto constantly give them words for talking about their feelings.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\nalways easy, but she really looks hard for the feelings that might be behind<br/>\nthe behavior and then labels them.  For instance, when I was visiting them<br/>\ntoday, my two year old grandson was getting into a lot of bad behavior,<br/>\nhitting and kicking, knocking stuff over, just being generally obnoxious.  I<br/>\nwas reading to his older sister.  Heather said to him, &quot;Kaelin, I wonder if<br/>\nyou&#39;re feeling left out.  I wonder if you need someone to read to you or<br/>\nplay with you.&quot;  He looked up, nodded his head, and went over to her for a<br/>\nsnuggle.  Problem solved for now.  Obviously it&#39;s going look different with<br/>\na nine year old, but you might find that it helps to spend a lot of time<br/>\ntalking about feelings when they aren&#39;t running really high.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"&quot;Tia Leschke&quot; &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1035001052","msgId":46852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMzIwMWMyNzcyZSRjZjdlZjQ4MCQ0OTcxOGU4YkBlYnVzNDk+","referencesHeader":"PGFvcWMwZithcnRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46848,"nextInTopic":46853,"prevInTime":46851,"nextInTime":46853,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She agrees that because most things come so <br/>\n&gt; easily to her, she feels &quot;stupid&quot; when she can&#39;t do something.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Logic <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; tells her she&#39;s not really stupid, but she&#39;s so frustrated at the <br/>\n&gt; time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then I think the most effective way to deal with it is to deal with <br/>\nthe frustration rather than punishing. I&#39;m sure we all know families <br/>\nwith kids who have lousy relationships with their parents and they&#39;re <br/>\nalways &quot;grounded&quot;.  Their parents are always yelling at them.  They <br/>\nget punished a LOT.  The goal should be to get to the heart of the <br/>\nissue, not to keep punishing her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She&#39;ll be playing the violin, and I&#39;ll tell her how nice it sounds, <br/>\n&gt; and she&#39;ll get frustrated anyway, because it wasn&#39;t perfect.  I&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; tell her it sounded great to me, but that doesn&#39;t help.  I&#39;ll ask <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what SHE thought was wrong, and she might say it was too fast or <br/>\n&gt; slow, so I&#39;ll suggest she try it again, or something like that.   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;M <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; GOING TO!  She&#39;ll yell.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if you stopped commenting?  What if, when you see her getting <br/>\nout the violin, you casually go do some project in another part of <br/>\nthe house and let her to work out her violin frustrations herself?  <br/>\nIf she comes looking for you and asking for help, then give it, but <br/>\nmaybe she just needs to work this out for herself? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, her attitude can come, often, from not wanting to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bothered.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not wanting to contribute.  Not wanting to make an effort.  Ho <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hum.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that when it&#39;s something that directly affects my <br/>\ndaughter, she&#39;s more than willing to help.  If she&#39;s having friends <br/>\nover, she&#39;ll clean up so they have a clutter free area to play.  If <br/>\nshe wants to make a special meal and the measuring cup she wants is <br/>\nin the sink, she&#39;ll wash it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be guilty of relying on her, as the oldest child, to run <br/>\nand do things for me all the time. She was my little errand girl.  <br/>\nPlease run and get me a diaper for the baby.  Please go put this in <br/>\nthe mailbox for me.  Please go get your brother a shirt.  Then I sat <br/>\nback (after reading a lot of posts on this list!) and thought about <br/>\nhow I&#39;d feel in her situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now, if I&#39;m running late and one of the boys aren&#39;t dressed, I <br/>\nmight say, &quot;Honey, I&#39;m really running late and he&#39;s not even <br/>\ndressed.  Do you have time to get me a shirt for him?&quot;  That&#39;s the <br/>\nsame way I&#39;d ask my husband for help.  Very rarely does she turn me <br/>\ndown, but once in awhile she&#39;ll say, &quot;Can you wait until I finish <br/>\n__________&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m kind of in the middle of a game&quot; or &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>\nSOOOO tired!&quot;  I&#39;m learning to accept it.  And I&#39;m trying not to ask <br/>\nher to run and get me stuff unless I am really stuck or really <br/>\noverwhelmed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also learning to often do things that she asks me to do.  Like <br/>\ntoday she has friends over and she was so excited and having such a <br/>\ngood time.  She wanted some food warmed up and asked if I would do it <br/>\nfor her and bring it to her.  There was a time when I would have <br/>\nsaid, &quot;You&#39;re capable of getting that yourself&quot;, but then I thought <br/>\nof all the times I was exhausted at the end of the day and asked her <br/>\nto go get me something because I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of walking <br/>\ndown the steps one more time.  I realized how important having these <br/>\nfriends over is to her and then happily got her the food and brought <br/>\nit to her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1034995372","msgId":46842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDE4LjIwNDI1My4yNTg4LjMuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46840,"nextInTopic":46844,"prevInTime":46841,"nextInTime":46843,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We talked about how if she wanted to do it, she <br/>\n&gt; could.  She can do anything she puts her mind to.  We talked about <br/>\n&gt; how she may have a &quot;gift&quot; for music, it might come easily, or she <br/>\n&gt; might not, and she would have to work a bit harder.  Either way, if <br/>\n&gt; she put forth the effort, she could do it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s just plain hard to struggle with something.

My niece needed more time<br/>\nbeing the baby when her little sister came.  <br/>\n &quot;Why do I always have to...  &quot;  sounds like she really feels she&#39;s not<br/>\nbeing treated fairly.  If she feels that way, could you talk about why?  <br/>\nDo you ask her to do more than she&#39;s ready to maybe, or are you asking<br/>\nwhen she&#39;s busy with something else.? Can you give her the option to do<br/>\nit when she&#39;s finished?  <br/>\nA policy that has worked around here is that when I want something done, <br/>\nwhen *I* want it,  I do it.  Everyone sort of operates that way,  and<br/>\nwhen one of us does need help, it doesn&#39;t feel like a chore to help<br/>\nbecause we haven&#39;t be hounded about doing stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Different kids have different personalities.

I try to back off more and give<br/>\nhim *all* the info of why I&#39;m asking. If I tell him my reasons first and not<br/>\njust ask or demand he is much more agreeable.

When she&#39;s <br/>\npracticing, I continually tell her how well she&#39;s doing (even when it <br/>\nisn&#39;t perfect!) We&#39;ve talked about how everyone has strengths and <br/>\nweaknesses, that everyone is different.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she started taking the violin, we didn&#39;t know if that, too, <br/>\nwould come easily.

You have to listen to what she can&#39;t <br/>\nsay. <br/>\n&gt; She is really trying to reach you.  You have to be the one with <br/>\nenough<br/>\n&gt; maturity to decode her message.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In you&#39;re first post you referred to her as gifted and then you <br/>\nsaid she<br/>\n&gt; feels bad when violin doesn&#39;t go perfectly.   She might be having an<br/>\n&gt; impossible time living up to everyone&#39;s expectation of a gifted <br/>\ndaughter.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; You should think about this.<br/>\n&gt; Does she feel like you expect a certain standard from her?<br/>\n&gt; Does she feel like she has to be perfect to get your approval?<br/>\n&gt; Does she feel that if she fails she&#39;s let you down?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how such a label can be helpful to a child in any way.  <br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; think it can be hugely oppressive.  Maybe you should work on <br/>\ngetting rid<br/>\n&gt; of that whole gifted thing and see if that helps.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Children need the freedom to make mistakes without feeling like <br/>\nthey&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; lose their parents love.  If you punish her for getting angry or<br/>\n&gt; frustrated, she may think you&#39;re withholding affection because <br/>\nyou&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; disappointed that your &quot;gifted&quot; daughter failed to do something<br/>\n&gt; perfectly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There may be some benefit to quiet communication about what upsets <br/>\nher.  <br/>\n&gt; Ask what you can do to make her feel happier.  She might not know at<br/>\n&gt; first, but keep talking about it when things are calm.   Kids learn <br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; expressing emotion like they learn everything else, on their own<br/>\n&gt; schedules.  It takes time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People talk to kids about respect a lot.  But if a child never <br/>\npersonally<br/>\n&gt; receives respect it&#39;s hard to know how to give it.  Think about how <br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; respect she gets as a member of your family and see if you are<br/>\n&gt; demonstrating the kind of consideration you&#39;d like her to have for <br/>\nyou. <br/>\n&gt; These things can be reciprocal.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope you go back and read some of the responses to your other <br/>\npost.  <br/>\n&gt; Someone who is upset and frustrated doesn&#39;t need to be punished, <br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; need love and understanding.  She needs you to help her cope with <br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; strong emotions and she needs to know you love her no matter what. <br/>\n&gt; Punishment accomplishes neither of those things. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another thing here is that frustration IS the natural consequence of<br/>\n&gt; continual disappointment.  Anger IS the natural consequence of being<br/>\n&gt; misunderstood or treated unfairly.  She knows all about <br/>\nconsequences. <br/>\n&gt; You want to set her up with unnatural consequences (punishment) and <br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; will only make it worse, and asking her to help you treat her <br/>\nunfairly is<br/>\n&gt; a terrible idea.   Kids hurt themselves all the time over emotional<br/>\n&gt; problems and I don&#39;t think you want to go there.   She should NOT <br/>\nbe made<br/>\n&gt; to punish herself so YOU can claim it was her choice. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb L </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112087015,"authorName":"luv2unskool","from":"&quot;luv2unskool&quot; &lt;cmr0523@...&gt;","profile":"luv2unskool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1034990415","msgId":46834,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFvcWMwZithcnRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwLjI3YWRlZDI2LjJhZTIwNjAwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46832,"nextInTopic":46835,"prevInTime":46833,"nextInTime":46835,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Are you saying that you never provide consequences or punishments for inappropriate behaviors?

You have to be the one with enough<br/>\nmaturity to decode her message.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn you&#39;re first post you referred to her as gifted and then you said she<br/>\nfeels bad when violin doesn&#39;t go perfectly.   She might be having an<br/>\nimpossible time living up to everyone&#39;s expectation of a gifted daughter.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou should think about this.<br/>\nDoes she feel like you expect a certain standard from her?<br/>\nDoes she feel like she has to be perfect to get your approval?<br/>\nDoes she feel that if she fails she&#39;s let you down?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how such a label can be helpful to a child in any way.  I<br/>\nthink it can be hugely oppressive.  Maybe you should work on getting rid<br/>\nof that whole gifted thing and see if that helps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren need the freedom to make mistakes without feeling like they&#39;ll<br/>\nlose their parents love.  If you punish her for getting angry or<br/>\nfrustrated, she may think you&#39;re withholding affection because you&#39;re<br/>\ndisappointed that your &quot;gifted&quot; daughter failed to do something<br/>\nperfectly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be some benefit to quiet communication about what upsets her.  <br/>\nAsk what you can do to make her feel happier.  She might not know at<br/>\nfirst, but keep talking about it when things are calm.   Kids learn about<br/>\nexpressing emotion like they learn everything else, on their own<br/>\nschedules.  It takes time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople talk to kids about respect a lot.  But if a child never personally<br/>\nreceives respect it&#39;s hard to know how to give it.  Think about how much<br/>\nrespect she gets as a member of your family and see if you are<br/>\ndemonstrating the kind of consideration you&#39;d like her to have for you. <br/>\nThese things can be reciprocal.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you go back and read some of the responses to your other post.  <br/>\nSomeone who is upset and frustrated doesn&#39;t need to be punished, they<br/>\nneed love and understanding.  She needs you to help her cope with her<br/>\nstrong emotions and she needs to know you love her no matter what. <br/>\nPunishment accomplishes neither of those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing here is that frustration IS the natural consequence of<br/>\ncontinual disappointment.  Anger IS the natural consequence of being<br/>\nmisunderstood or treated unfairly.  She knows all about consequences. <br/>\nYou want to set her up with unnatural consequences (punishment) and you<br/>\nwill only make it worse, and asking her to help you treat her unfairly is<br/>\na terrible idea.   Kids hurt themselves all the time over emotional<br/>\nproblems and I don&#39;t think you want to go there.   She should NOT be made<br/>\nto punish herself so YOU can claim it was her choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112087015,"authorName":"luv2unskool","from":"&quot;luv2unskool&quot; &lt;cmr0523@...&gt;","profile":"luv2unskool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Attitude & Consequences","postDate":"1034976128","msgId":46814,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFvcHUyMCtkdTBjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46831,"prevInTime":46813,"nextInTime":46815,"topicId":46814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m struggling with my 9 year old daughter, and her behaviors.

It is <br/>\nusually bad attitude or disrespect.  Yelling, door slamming, refusing <br/>\nto do something she&#39;s asked.  (Brushing her teeth, remember?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had posted earlier in the week, regarding some of the same issues.  <br/>\nI got lots of don&#39;t ask her to do anything, bribe her to do things or <br/>\ngo places, brush my teeth with her - (she&#39;s not 3, she&#39;s 9.  This <br/>\ngame won&#39;t work with her), etc.  Ugh!  I am still frustrated, having <br/>\nnot yet found a solution that works for me/us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel there should be consequences to her actions.  I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nlistening to her be disrespectful and rude, then take her for an ice <br/>\ncream 5 minutes later.  It seems as though I would be rewarding her <br/>\ninappropriate behavior.  &quot;Oh sure honey, you can have a sleepover, <br/>\neven though you screamed at me, and slammed your door!  In fact, have <br/>\n2 friends over!&quot;  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certain, reasonable behaviors I expect.  I&#39;m not talking <br/>\nabout making the bed, chores etc.  I&#39;m getting over the messy room, <br/>\nI&#39;ve asked her to close the door.  I get stressed to go into a messy <br/>\nroom, so I just won&#39;t go in - problem solved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about kindness and respect.  I don&#39;t care if we&#39;re <br/>\nunschooling, homeschooling, or public schooling, she doesn&#39;t need to <br/>\nbe disrupting the family, and disrespecting or hurting anyone.  (We <br/>\nare unschooling and loving it, by the way!)  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t pretend she isn&#39;t doing it, or ignore it.  I can&#39;t bribe her <br/>\nnot to do it.  She&#39;s a very bright 9, I can&#39;t trick her into it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only solution I see, is consequences.  Let her know up front what <br/>\nthe consequences will be, maybe even have HER come up with them.  <br/>\nThen she knows.  Then she&#39;s making the choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNeed more advice!  <br/>\nThanks in advance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50015,"nextTopicId":49730}}
