I know I know.  This guy was a homeschooler, right?  Yes, I know<br/>\nhe&#39;s talking to school people.  Picture me whining a bit here.  ;)  Or<br/>\nnot.  It just seems odd, what he&#39;s proposing these teachers do with<br/>\ntheir classes.

That&#39;s not always grief.

And that&#39;s part of what the  <br/>\n&gt; culture is preparing kids for, too, for the possibility (liklihood,  <br/>\n&gt; in many cases, historically) that they would grow up to be field  <br/>\n&gt; workers or farm workers or housemaids and have to get up very early  <br/>\n&gt; and do what other people told them to do.    But if someone CHOOSES  <br/>\n&gt; that position, it&#39;s all different.

I meant grief in terms of taking away choices<br/>\nthat obviously conflicted with the person&#39;s wishes to whom the choices<br/>\nwould probably have the most impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest difference between Marty and the majority of anybody in<br/>\nthe Western world is his decision&#39;s informed by what HE wants to do<br/>\nwith his time.  Many people have no idea what they want and really it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t usually enter into the equation.  This includes a lot of nuns,<br/>\nmonks, soldiers and other uniformed folk.  My dh works in a factory<br/>\nwhere uniforms are provided and it&#39;s so ironic to see the humanity<br/>\npeaking out the seams of those uniforms which are obviously despised<br/>\nby many of the workers for whatever reason (and I&#39;m sure there&#39;re many<br/>\nreasons).  When the buzzer/bell rings a parade begins between shifts.<br/>\n Dh gets comments on his hair during work, and I would say that&#39;s the<br/>\neasiest thing for people to get by with in terms of nonconformity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathe</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] one about education; was: Re: another article about homeschooling","postDate":"1141871188","msgId":112615,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNDE4RkFELUMyRDktNDlFRS1CODdELUQ1Qjc1QTFGQzVBMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGR1bnJwcStkM2RxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR1bnJwcStkM2RxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":112612,"nextInTopic":112701,"prevInTime":112614,"nextInTime":112616,"topicId":112612,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... desk with my arm stretched to the clouds eeping  Oooh!  ooh!

One of his favorite words is<br/>\nvideoclips.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found Monke&#39;s article irritating based on logic not just on<br/>\nunschooling or gentle parenting.

Yet these projects\u0014the<br/>\nsteady diet of virtual trips to the Antarctic, virtual climbs to the<br/>\nsummit of Mount Everest, and trips into cyber-orbit that represent one<br/>\ntechnological high after another\u0014generate only vicarious thrills. The<br/>\nstudent doesn&#39;t actually soar above the Earth, doesn&#39;t trek across icy<br/>\nterrain, doesn&#39;t climb a mountain. Increasingly, she isn&#39;t even<br/>\nallowed to climb to the top of the jungle gym.::::<br/>\n<br/>\nWordy, isn&#39;t it?  I was intrigued by the word &quot;allowed&quot; there because<br/>\nI at first fell into a misinterpretation that the child was allowed to<br/>\ngo online SOMEtimes whenever she was NOT allowed to play on the jungle<br/>\ngym.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the writer meant.  I think the<br/>\nimplication was that children cannot climb on the jungle gym while<br/>\nonline.  This is like saying &quot;the sky is blue.&quot;  I would guess and be<br/>\ncorrect to say that children climbing on the jungle gym cannot<br/>\nsimultaneously use the swing either.  And grass is usually green too.<br/>\n\t<br/>\n::::&lt;snip&gt; ... students came back down to the Earth of their immediate<br/>\nsurroundings with boredom and disinterest\u0014and a desire to get back<br/>\nonline.::::<br/>\n<br/>\nWell there you have it.  It seems there&#39;s a distinct disadvantage to<br/>\nexactly the behavior the writer advocates.  Not allowing children<br/>\naccess to the computer equals boredom and disinterest.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthere&#39;s a benefit to withholding special choices that adults choose to<br/>\ncordon off from children --educationally or in any way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the virtue of allowing outdoor play but not allowing choices? <br/>\nWhen children know choices are there, not allowing them the power to<br/>\nmake decisions means we don&#39;t trust their abilities or motives or<br/>\nwhatever.  It doesn&#39;t mean they make bad or good decisions.  It means<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t allowed to make decisions AT ALL.  I can attest to<br/>\ndetesting this way of growing up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can also attest to the difficulty in spite of what my heart says of<br/>\nbreaking away from the ingrained belief that children should be<br/>\ndecided for and adults should be in total control.  It&#39;s not easy. <br/>\nI&#39;m consciously allowing ds as many choices as possible.  I&#39;m getting<br/>\nbetter at it but still have much to learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a real way, withholding choices from children is a long time in<br/>\nwhich both children and adults lack certain choices in naturally,<br/>\npeacefully and happily relating to one another because parents allow<br/>\nexperts to tell them children aren&#39;t capable of making good decisions.<br/>\n I can already see this playing out between me and ds and dh too for<br/>\nthat matter.  When one person grabs control of another&#39;s choices, it<br/>\nalways causes grief.  Conversely when we are in concert with one<br/>\nanother, so to speak, each person has their own unique precious thing<br/>\nto say in their own voice, something we would otherwise miss altogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cris&quot; &lt;muddpies@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oriononline.org/pages/om/05-5om/Monke.html\">http://www.oriononline.org/pages/om/05-5om/Monke.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My sister - who has no children, and doesn&#39;t necessarily agree that<br/>\n&gt; home/unschooling is best for mine - sent me this link today.
