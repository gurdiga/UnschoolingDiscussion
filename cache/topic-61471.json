I am a lurker here for the most part, as my children are only 3 years and 6 months, but it is so nice to hear about unschooling from the point of view of someone who is currently seeing both sides... the pros and cons you&#39;re experiencing firsthand from being unschooled verses the &quot;other&quot; educational setting.  Especially hearing how you see schools currently are, which I&#39;m sure are different (worse) than they were even when *I* was in school 15 years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just really glad you posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenW</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61466,"nextTopicId":61458}}
