This particular friend of mine is in <br/>\nmy art class with me and I have a whole list of unbelievable ps stories from <br/>\nher and other friends there (though for some reason she&#39;s the only person in <br/>\nour group who actually pulled her child from ps).  Somehow the others treat <br/>\nit as some sort of necessary evil.  I mean, they can relate the stories with <br/>\nthe appropriate level of disbelief and horror, but figure it&#39;s just a bad <br/>\nteacher and their child will just have to deal with it until next year, when <br/>\nhopefully they get a better teacher.
