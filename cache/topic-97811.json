My children <br/>\nwent to public school until 6th, and 3rd grades until I got so fed up <br/>\nI decided to homeschool. Our first year was wonderful. Lots of fun <br/>\nand activities. Once I joined a support group and met many other <br/>\nhomeschoolers, I began to doubt my abilities and felt quite inferior! <br/>\nNo one else seemed to have my relaxed, unit study type opinion of <br/>\neducation. Surely, since they were much more experienced than me, <br/>\nthey knew the &quot;right&quot; way. So, I adopted a more rigid (still couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbring myself to do grades, report cards, etc.) approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, long story short, our homeschooling went from fun, de-<br/>\nschooling to boring, rote, get the correct yearly subjects done <br/>\ncriteria. Not to mention, we had a surprise little addition to our <br/>\nfamily 17 months ago. Now, I am busy with a toddler, my oldest is a <br/>\nsenior this year, and my middle son will begin 9th grade. (I know, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t break free of the grade mentality yet either!) Basically, I <br/>\nhave always read and loved everything about unschooling, but get <br/>\nnervous when it comes down to it. I end up buying curriculum and <br/>\nfollowing the school subjects model. I want to be an unschooler. Can <br/>\nit realistically work with 14 and 18 yr. olds?
