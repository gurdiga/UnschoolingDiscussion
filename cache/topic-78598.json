I&#39;m more prepared to help decide if it&#39;s going to be ok and also to guide through or even skip some bits that might be problematic. <br/>\nI also watch with them, we talk, not in a schooley way but more in a touching base or explaining things depending on what comes up or how it comes across.  I did this even with books in the past, reading on my own but with them when something new (to me) was interesting to them. They read The Hunger Games, for example, when those were first out and they were quite young. I had been worried the content might be too intense and wanted to partner with them if that happened...so I prepared to BE there by knowing what they were reading and being able to chat with them having knowledge about the book.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of times, with growing kids, this is the surest way to help them branch out into new territory from a loving, safe place, I have found. Makes conversations more interesting, too, when we&#39;ve experienced the new media together, particularly when it&#39;s been designed with &quot;older&quot; tastes in mind, but really, being in tune with them, close and safe and involved, helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as teens and young adults, they still share with me and bounce things off of me, but they no longer need me to look out for them as much. I still get things run by me, though, because they trust me and know I will point out anything that might upset them,  then they choose.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"","from":"Sandra@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: About a nine year old and R- and X-rated movies","postDate":"1565221726","msgId":78602,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHFpZm8wdSszbGRlN3BAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHFpZmk0NCszbXBuc2dAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PHFpZmk0NCszbXBuc2dAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78601,"nextInTopic":78603,"prevInTime":78601,"nextInTime":78603,"topicId":78598,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, responding.
