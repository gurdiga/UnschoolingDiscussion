If they want to pursue things that are of interest to them,<br/>\nthey need to be able to research and find out things about them on their<br/>\nown.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beneficial for me to read everything to them. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the (many) reasons school doesn&#39;t work so well is the over emphasis<br/>\n&gt; on -- that borders on worship of -- learning through reading. Schools need<br/>\n&gt; the kids lined up neatly, learning the same thing in the same way at the<br/>\n&gt; same time so they can all be uniformly tested. Schools depend on learning<br/>\n&gt; through reading because it&#39;s *convenient* for *schools* not because it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; finest method for kids. And for some kids, depending on their learning<br/>\n&gt; style, learning in other ways is far superior. If they&#39;re not reading,<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re not learning is far from the truth.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And schools get us so scared about writing, making us believe it&#39;s an<br/>\n&gt; impossible task and kids need to start learning as early as possible. But<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s only true when kids are forced to write when they have nothing to say<br/>\n&gt; and no reason to say it. Writing is just translating thoughts into written<br/>\n&gt; words to transfer them to someone else&#39;s head. It&#39;s just talking on paper.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s generally more formal than talking, even at it&#39;s most informal, but<br/>\n&gt; people use various levels of formality in speaking depending on who they are<br/>\n&gt; talking to so writing isn&#39;t much different.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If kids are taught that writing is hard through boring, personally<br/>\n&gt; meaningless exercises then it becomes hard. If they have no experience with<br/>\n&gt; writing being hard, then it&#39;s as natural as anything else. (And some will be<br/>\n&gt; better at it than others, of course.) But the less negative experience they<br/>\n&gt; have, the easier it will be for them to figure out what they need to get<br/>\n&gt; their point across.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can assure you that we are far from &quot;worshipping&quot; academia.  They do<br/>\nhowever need to be able to find things out for themselves.  I don&#39;t see<br/>\nnegative experiences as being necessarily bad.  I personally have grown<br/>\nthrough negative experiences and have seen my children do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My first two<br/>\n&gt;&gt; entered college at 15 and I just can&#39;t see that happening with the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; mindset.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well Pam Sorooshian (who will undoubtedly be along at some point) has 2<br/>\n&gt; taking community college courses at 14 and 17 (I believe).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But what&#39;s the rush? What great enhancement to their joy in life will they<br/>\n&gt; have if they enter college at 15 instead of 18 (or 20 or 25)?

Schools need<br/>\nthe kids lined up neatly, learning the same thing in the same way at the<br/>\nsame time so they can all be uniformly tested. Schools depend on learning<br/>\nthrough reading because it&#39;s *convenient* for *schools* not because it&#39;s the<br/>\nfinest method for kids. And for some kids, depending on their learning<br/>\nstyle, learning in other ways is far superior. If they&#39;re not reading,<br/>\nthey&#39;re not learning is far from the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd schools get us so scared about writing, making us believe it&#39;s an<br/>\nimpossible task and kids need to start learning as early as possible. But<br/>\nthat&#39;s only true when kids are forced to write when they have nothing to say<br/>\nand no reason to say it. Writing is just translating thoughts into written<br/>\nwords to transfer them to someone else&#39;s head. It&#39;s just talking on paper.<br/>\nIt&#39;s generally more formal than talking, even at it&#39;s most informal, but<br/>\npeople use various levels of formality in speaking depending on who they are<br/>\ntalking to so writing isn&#39;t much different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids are taught that writing is hard through boring, personally<br/>\nmeaningless exercises then it becomes hard. If they have no experience with<br/>\nwriting being hard, then it&#39;s as natural as anything else. (And some will be<br/>\nbetter at it than others, of course.) But the less negative experience they<br/>\nhave, the easier it will be for them to figure out what they need to get<br/>\ntheir point across.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My first two<br/>\n&gt; entered college at 15 and I just can&#39;t see that happening with the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;relaxed&quot; mindset.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well Pam Sorooshian (who will undoubtedly be along at some point) has 2<br/>\ntaking community college courses at 14 and 17 (I believe).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what&#39;s the rush?

Is it a<br/>\ncompetition to get as many work years in as possible before retirement ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr might there be an advantage to exploring interests to discover the things<br/>\nthat make them want to jump out of bed in the morning?

He has been the same way since he was about 2.5. He has always loved books and movies way ahead of his age... He loves bugs of all kind, dinosaurs, tornadoes, and lately insects. He is also very knowledgeable in these areas. For instance just today he saw a spider web with a very interesting spider sitting in the middle of it. I commented that I thought this spider had made a wonderful web, and said I wonder what kind of spider it is. He told me that the spider has made her web and is now waiting for food. He told me what she would do with her food, in great detail. He then suggested that we forget about our walk and go inside to get his &quot;Insect&quot; book to find her, so we can know what kind she is. So we turned around and went inside. He then got his book, plopped down on the floor, and found her. So after we read about her we went back outside to see how she was doing. He is also starting to read... (I am doing nothing at all to teach him). He regularly tells me what a word is. And he is always correct. Just the other day we went to Wal Mart, which was recently &quot;upgraded&quot; into a Super Wal Mart. We were looking for the pet department, so we took the handy map, of course he needed one too. After just a few seconds he comes to me with his map, and shows me where the &quot;Pet&quot; department is located. He is reading all on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58541700,"authorName":"Betty Holder","from":"&quot;Betty Holder&quot; &lt;ninnyridge03@...&gt;","profile":"ninnyridge03","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Newbie with a question","postDate":"1020490764","msgId":36716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWMxZjMyZSQwZjgzNjhjMCRmYjlhZDU0M0BqMXUxdTI+","referencesHeader":"PDFiZS5hZDhhZTQuMmEwNDBkYzhAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDIwNTAzMTY0NzQ2LjAwYzA4YTYwQHBvcC1zZXJ2ZXIuc2MucnIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36713,"nextInTopic":36733,"prevInTime":36715,"nextInTime":36717,"topicId":36708,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Are you enjoying homeschool more since you *relaxed*?  I&#39;ll bet your kids are!  I&#39;ll bet you spent a lot of stressful years getting your first 2 into college at 15.!! <br/>\n<br/>\n  Who in the world ever decided that all children should learn all the same things at exactly the same age in exactly the same way????  It has taken me a while to realize that academics are NOT the only thing we&#39;re teaching here. We&#39;re learning from each other daily.  This is LIFE!!!  <br/>\n  Unschooling allows us to ENJOY life and each other without having to cram a lot of *knowledge* into the kids that they are not going to retain anyway. <br/>\n  Unschooling scared me a bit when we first started it,  I think that is because we are conditioned to think that SCHOOL is a standard method set down by the Public School system and that we MUST adhere to that or we&#39;re doing it all wrong and our kids will suffer. <br/>\n  I KNOW, without a doubt, my son learns better with the relaxed unschooling method than any other way we&#39;ve tried.  Including public school<br/>\n  Don&#39;t worry too much.  They all march to the beat of their own drummer, you know!<br/>\n  Betty <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
