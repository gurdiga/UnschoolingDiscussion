Have you been this way yet? There<br/>\nis another hs mom who is going to be in touch in Feb and is moving here too.<br/>\nHer son is also 8. My daughter Melissa is going to be 8 and my son Kyle just<br/>\nturned 7. I am seriously looking into checking out the art museum in<br/>\nManchester have you gone to the homeschooling fine art classes they look<br/>\nterrific and maybe worth the 2 hour drive each way? Would love to know if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve checked it out. I don&#39;t know where you are is it near Portsmouth<br/>\nanother cool town. I am considering contacting a certified teacher near<br/>\nthere to be the one I go to for the evals. she is actually in Maine but does<br/>\nthem for both states I&#39;ve noticed her bio on the web page for NH.. She only<br/>\ncharges between $25-$35. Have others interviewed these evaluators and what<br/>\nsort of questions do you guys ask them?

I&#39;m an unsc= <br/>\nhooler in New Hampshire and I&#39;d like to let you know that the only really n= <br/>\negative feedback I&#39;ve gotten from people around here regarding homeschoolin= <br/>\ng is because I live in Rye and the elementary school here received the NATI= <br/>\nONAL BLUE RIBBON AWARD. Yadda yadda. They are so proud of that that they = <br/>\neven put it on realty signs in front of houses. So instead of a little sig= <br/>\nn above that says &quot;3 Bedroom&quot;, etc., it says Blue Ribbon Award. It&#39;s funny= <br/>\nbecause no one who has told me that has known what the criteria for the aw= <br/>\nard is. LOL It really doesn&#39;t impress me. In Michigan we chose to live i= <br/>\nn an area that was suppose to be one of the best schools. And it was the = <br/>\nworst school experience we ever had...which is why I started researching ho= <br/>\nmeschooling. Anyway, I&#39;m glad you have a friend in OH because the laws the= <br/>\nre are basically the same and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s answered alot of your question= <br/>\ns. It&#39;s really a lot easier than it seems to homeschool here. If you need= <br/>\nany help feel free to email me. By the way, what part of New Hampshire ar= <br/>\ne you in? I have 3 kiddies Stephen 8, Dani 3, and Brie 16 mos (but she thi= <br/>\nnks she&#39;s 3 too). <br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Free voicemail and email, by phone or Web!
