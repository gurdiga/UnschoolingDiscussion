I know that can sound scary, especially<br/>\nto someone who is new to homeschooling or especially unschooling. But<br/>\nhonestly, in our house, we have no plan of action, we have no &quot;school year&quot;,<br/>\nwe have no themes or child-led activities that are being planned that my 2<br/>\nkids want to pursue next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, since your daughter has expressed an interest in edangered species,<br/>\nit&#39;s great to pursue that interest. How about starting today or tomorrow<br/>\ninstead of waiting for the &quot;appropriate time&quot; to begin? Forgive me if I&#39;m<br/>\nnot accurately understanding your plans for unschooling your daughter, but<br/>\nthis is just my impression from what you&#39;ve written.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I love unschooling is because we are so free to learn about<br/>\nwhatever we want to, on any given day, at any given moment. There are no<br/>\nplans in place to restrict us. One interest effortlessly leads into another<br/>\nlinked interest, and that is how we learn about things every day, all year.<br/>\nIt is also so natural to learn in this manner! I homeschooled my 2 boys for<br/>\n5 years before unschooling, and everytime I asked my kids &quot;what would you<br/>\nlike to learn about?&quot;, first they would say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, then I would<br/>\npress and they would give me some answer like &quot;airplanes&quot; and I tried to<br/>\nfollow through with some contrived thematic unit about &quot;airplanes&quot;, and it<br/>\nall seemed so false and unnatural! The kids weren&#39;t really interested in it<br/>\nand were quick to let me know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think it is good to help your child learn about what interests them,<br/>\nbut when they start resisting and saying they don&#39;t want to do a certain<br/>\nscheduled activity, it&#39;s time to back off because the learning isn&#39;t<br/>\nhappening anymore, IMO. And I know that&#39;s true about how *I* learn things,<br/>\ntoo. When my DH starts talking to me about JAVA programming, my eyes glaze<br/>\nover and I want to run out of the room! But when I want to learn something<br/>\nspecific to help myself on the computer, I ask him about it and I learn it<br/>\nimmediately, and retain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s how we do unschooling at our house. What has your experience<br/>\nbeen with your children?<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35753,"nextTopicId":35893}}
