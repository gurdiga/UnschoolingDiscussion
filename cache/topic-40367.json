I have also learned that you don&#39;t need all of the other things <br/>\nto seek and speak to the creator. Going back to my native ancestry  beliefs <br/>\nand studying yoruba, and native spirituality has helped me see alot of <br/>\nthings. Even having my latest child (baby #7 a planned unassisted birth) has <br/>\nmade me aware of alot of things. How so well we are connected to <br/>\neverything........I know that she knew me before she even came to me... I <br/>\nstill wonder why she chose us to be her parents... Obviously she needs to <br/>\nshow us something or she needs to redo something, but she has taught us so <br/>\nmuch.. She has changed us. We view things with so much depth now.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a song by India Arie called I see God in you....<br/>\nThat is so true....Yes, I may see her, but there are ALOT of times that I see <br/>\nGod in her.Those looks are not just her looks. Especially when I am down and <br/>\ndo something stupid without thinking. I can look at her and see inner peace <br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n WHen she was born, I looked at her and asked who&#39;s old soul are you. I had <br/>\nrecently sent a friend a picture of her since she just turned 1 and she <br/>\ncalled me and said...She is an old soul...look at those eyes...the wisdom <br/>\nthat they hold.  I said , I know..we have been saying that since she was <br/>\nborn. We do indeed call her our spirit child. The depth of love that she has <br/>\nengrossed in us is truly unbelieveable. She is a free spirit and is teaching <br/>\nus more on how to be free spirits as well.<br/>\nI also believe that people have to find their own paths and I respect that.
