What we see on the media is what","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1332518279\">Hi,<br/>\nThis is from a Muslim girl on another list I am on....<br/>\nNot all Palestinians are celebrating these unforgivable events!<br/>\nWhat we see on the media is what they choose to photograph...and some of<br/>\nthem<br/>\nmay have their own agendas too.<br/>\nColin Powell spoke up and told people on ABC News that the Jerusalem office<br/>\nwas receiving many many calls of support from Palestinians.  They are upset<br/>\ntoo and angered that they are being portrayed through the photos of the<br/>\nactions of some stupid people.<br/>\nYasir Arafat donated blood as a show of support.<br/>\nMany Palestinians have relatives in America.  My husband is Palestinian and<br/>\nhe is horrified and deeply saddened and angered by the terrorist attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing you need to know about Islam is that it is a religion of<br/>\npeace.  In fact the name &quot;Islam&quot;  comes from the root word &quot;salaam&quot;  which<br/>\nis<br/>\nthe Arabic word for peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note that I don&#39;t consider the criminals who were involved in these<br/>\nevents to be practicing their religion (whatever religion they may have<br/>\nclaimed to follow) anymore than I consider Protestants in Ireland throwing<br/>\nrocks at Catholic schoolgirls or Timothy McVeigh to be practicing theirs.<br/>\nAny person may wear a label just as s/he wears a designer shirt, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything more than that.  Some folks wear labels<br/>\nfor<br/>\nsocial reasons, some for whatever other reasons, and for some it is to try<br/>\nto<br/>\neasily explain their beliefs.  Then there are the shirts or watches that<br/>\nspout the name brand, but were actually made in a backstreet sweat shop by<br/>\npeople who don&#39;t have quality materials.  These guys are like that.  They<br/>\nmay<br/>\nresemble a great name brand, but they are actually not the genuine<br/>\narticle....fakes hiding behind the name.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll religions have had and continue to have these kinds of people claiming<br/>\nto<br/>\nbe &quot;of them.&quot;  They find this association convenient for their own purposes.<br/>\nLet&#39;s not even talk about the Crusades.  We don&#39;t want another one of<br/>\nthose!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I prefer the Arabic term &quot;mu&#39;min&quot;  which simply means<br/>\n&quot;believer,&quot;<br/>\nand which is used in the Qur&#39;an.  In this case, the condition of the heart<br/>\nis<br/>\nthe deciding factor, not the label.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25790,"nextTopicId":25819}}
