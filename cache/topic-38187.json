Would it be<br/>\npossible to compromise a bit more -- perhaps feeding the kids before the<br/>\nparade, so that you could spend an hour or so with them, and then go back<br/>\ndown to the party, assuming they are old enough to be left in the room alone<br/>\nto sleep?  Most adult parties tend to go long enough that you wouldn&#39;t miss<br/>\nit all if you left and came back.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, if your children are too little to be left alone, someone is<br/>\ngoing to have to stay with them, and you would be the natural choice rather<br/>\nthan your husband, since it&#39;s his father&#39;s party.  (Or maybe spending a<br/>\nnight on a sofa bed at a fancy hotel would thrill your kid&#39;s favorite<br/>\nbabysitter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My children are not trophies to show off and then pushed away.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, they are not.  I have in-law problems sometimes, and I try, when<br/>\npossible, to take a deep breath and consider whether I care enough about<br/>\n*this* (and only this) issue enough to make a fuss.  If so, there&#39;s nothing<br/>\nwrong with standing against it.  However, sometimes it&#39;s worth going along<br/>\nwith an idea I&#39;m not crazy about for the sake of family peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38164,"nextTopicId":38193}}
