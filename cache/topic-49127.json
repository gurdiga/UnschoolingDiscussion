This is also my first &quot;official&quot; year of homeschooling.   I&#39;m currently record keeping and schooling seriously my 10 and 6 1/2 yr daughters, while trying to keep one busy almost 2 year old under foot!<br/>\nI love being able to answer everything my children ask me on a daily basis and not have them wait til the time is right(make sense).  I have tons of used materials I have bought over the past year in my quest for homeschooling.  Started with FIAR, 100 ez lessons(for 6yr), and now pretty much are doing things from Learn at Home, but, I don&#39;t follow it at all to the tee.<br/>\nNow after my long drawn out story, I am really looking for help, and I hope I can get input from you gals or at least a neat website to read up on.<br/>\nI&#39;m in Missouri, and our laws are pretty easy.  Record log on hours(1000 hrs. and at least of that has to be 600 for LA, Read, Math, Science, Social Studies), Lesson plan, items to show work basically, and then a record of evaluation.  Now we do not at any time have to turn these in, it is just for safety measure basically.<br/>\nOk, my thing is the lesson plan!   Could someone give me a sample of their day or point towards it.
