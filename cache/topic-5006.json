This isn&#39;t a new growth but I think<br/>\nespecially after 9/11 (and the situations in the world that led up to it)<br/>\npeople are looking for philosophies that provide absolute answers,<br/>\nguarantees and reassurances about the future -- something to calm their<br/>\nfears. Fundamentalism speaks to that. (I think those fears, though not<br/>\nentirely responsible, also contribute to the push for standardized testing<br/>\nand back to basics.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But the founding fathers intending the US to be a theocracy? The country was<br/>\n&gt; Christian already, where was the need for such a thing? Nevertheless, those<br/>\n&gt; men, with the exception of a few, were more than aware that orthodox<br/>\n&gt; Christianity was teetering around the world (the French Revolution?), and<br/>\n&gt; they were also aware that to stay consistent with their ideas of liberty,<br/>\n&gt; they would have to establish a system that let the Faith crash if that&#39;s what<br/>\n&gt; was to be. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>According to the fundamentalists. There&#39;s lots and lots of stuff on the<br/>\ninternet. Probably just typing in Christian &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; would yield<br/>\nloads of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a book series that&#39;s very popular among Christian fundamentalist<br/>\nhomeschoolers. (Maybe specifically those of the Calvinist persuasion but I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure of the fine distinctions between the various fundamentalist camps.)<br/>\nIf you go to just about any fundamentalist Christian homeschooling book<br/>\nprovider, these will be available. (Sonlight.com seems to be the rare<br/>\nexception.) There are two versions: one for adults (and teens?) and one for<br/>\nmiddle schoolers. There are also workbooks available for the children&#39;s<br/>\nversion.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m becoming more aware of how valuable that time spent debating and<br/>\nreading Christian fundamentalist homeschoolers in AOL&#39;s old homeschooling<br/>\nforum was. It was a rare opportunity to gain insight into their way of<br/>\nthinking. Anyone can obviously join a message board or list for Christian<br/>\nfundamentalists to hear what they&#39;re saying, but this was right there in our<br/>\nlaps without us having to go look for it and they were willing to debate<br/>\n(very heatedly often!) us non-fundamentalist types. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Light and the Glory by Peter Marshall<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800750543/qid=1029411116/sr=2-2/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800750543/qid=1029411116/sr=2-2/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_2_2/002-7626140-0354421<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a review at Amazon (written by a non-fundamentalist Christian):<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Peter Marshall and David Manuel have done their homework. There is no doubt<br/>\n&gt; about it. They have proposed a thesis - that America was discovered, explored,<br/>\n&gt; and founded as an explicitly Christian nation, and that God&#39;s hand can be<br/>\n&gt; evident in it&#39;s early history - and have defended it well. They have gone back<br/>\n&gt; to some interesting primary sources, which do, in fact, shed light on our<br/>\n&gt; nation&#39;s early history. As such, the book is a valuable read.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; THIS BEING SAID, for the author&#39;s thesis to stand, one must comprehend and<br/>\n&gt; assume a totally Calvinistic understanding of Christian theology, AND assume<br/>\n&gt; that our Founding Fathers were working under similar paradigms. Such an<br/>\n&gt; historical point of view is difficult to defend. Some of our nation&#39;s Founders<br/>\n&gt; did indeed come from such a theological viewpoint. Many, however, did not.<br/>\n&gt; (And our two significant founding documents were penned by a Deist and an<br/>\n&gt; Episcopalian!) Such a point of view is also difficult, not only to those who<br/>\n&gt; do not profess the Christian faith, but for the enormous majority of those who<br/>\n&gt; do! (Catholics, Orthodox, many Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, some<br/>\n&gt; Baptists, etc.) If a Calvinistic viewpoint is removed from the book, the<br/>\n&gt; entire premise collapses.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please don&#39;t get me wrong -- Marshall and Manuel have assembled a great deal<br/>\n&gt; of research, and have presented it in an interesting and entertaining fashion.<br/>\n&gt; The &quot;facts&quot; are there. It&#39;s just that I (speaking as both a committed<br/>\n&gt; Christian and a historian) can&#39;t buy their &quot;interpretation&quot; of those facts.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The Light and the Glory for Children by Peter Marshall<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800754484/qid=1029411116/sr=2-1/ref=\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800754484/qid=1029411116/sr=2-1/ref=</a><br/>\nsr_2_1/002-7626140-0354421<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the publisher:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The Light and the Glory for Children makes clear to young readers ages nine to<br/>\n&gt; twelve how God worked through the founders of America to establish this<br/>\n&gt; nation.

Say a social<br/>\nworker comes to the door, their literature would tell you to call them and<br/>\nlet them handle it. You would have gotten your money&#39;s worth then, right?  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think so and here&#39;s why.   Our homeschooling freedoms can only be<br/>\nprotected when we, as individuals, feel we are competent and capable people.<br/>\nBy dealing with situations ourselves we do two things, we strengthen<br/>\nourselves and we teach our children to depend on themselves.  Now, yes,<br/>\nsometimes the problems are too large and complex to handle on our own and we<br/>\nthen turn to folks who can help.  But the focus of that help should be<br/>\ncentered on what is good for you.  HSLDA states up front that you must agree<br/>\nto whatever decision they make, or lose their services.  I know of no other<br/>\nlaw firm that  stipulates that.  I once spent 18 months litigating a court<br/>\nbattle and never once did my lawyer say, if we don&#39;t do it this way, I&#39;m out<br/>\nof here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems backwards to say the  fact HSLDA took care of a problem for someone<br/>\nwas really no help at all, but that&#39;s how I see this.  Their focus should be<br/>\non teaching and information, so that others may handle their own problems.<br/>\nUnfortunately, if you send off for their financial statements for the last<br/>\nfew years, you will see they put -$0- in the column for court cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond this the situation really becomes complicated when you find out what<br/>\nthey do with that $5 million a year in income.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nso much for sharing the URL to the HEM site.
