Our first 2 yrs of <br/>\nhomeschooling were relaxed, and I use to do little stuff like <br/>\nspelling tests, and math sheets maybe once a week.  My dd is now 11 <br/>\nand doesn&#39;t write a lot but has a good grasp of spelling.  My ds8 <br/>\nwrote me a story the other day and it was inventive spelling at it&#39;s <br/>\nbest.  For the 1st time in over 3 years, I lapsed and suggested maybe <br/>\nit would be helpful to learn to spell a little better by doing some <br/>\nspelling tests, like I use to do with his sister.  He looked at me <br/>\nlike I was a moron, and I said &quot;oh, come on, give it one try&quot;.  We <br/>\ndid one test, 8 words.  I had to coax him though it a little.  After <br/>\nit was done I asked him if he would want to do that every once in a <br/>\nwhile.  He said, &quot;Mom.  I&#39;m a smart kid.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have figured <br/>\nout how to spell words by the time I&#39;m a grown up.&quot;  <br/>\nI said, &quot;But what about right now.  Are you worried that you won&#39;t be <br/>\nable to spell things when you are with friends and that might make <br/>\nyou feel bad?&quot;  He said, &quot;No.  I don&#39;t care what they think.&quot;<br/>\nI have absolutely no doubt this kid will be able to spell and do <br/>\nwhatever he wants, whenever he wants.  I have never had any long <br/>\nunschooling discussions with him.  Little things here and there.<br/>\nHe went to pre school and K and came out thinking school is where you <br/>\nlearn.

And a <br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t have to read about unschooling to &quot;get it.&quot;   Once his life is <br/>\na learning-fest, he&#39;ll see it on his own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPointing out each thing he learns or each &quot;educational&quot; thing he does is <br/>\nprobably not the best approach, either.  Let it flow for a while.  If each <br/>\nmoment or conversation or activity is going to be reviewed for its <br/>\neducational content, the whole day becomes one long test, and life&#39;s being <br/>\nlived for the purpose of the review.  That makes things too self-conscious, <br/>\nand he might close down some, or avoid the situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis afternoon, we&#39;re planning to go to the children&#39;s museum.  We were just <br/>\nthere last week with Zenmomma and her kids, but my husband&#39;s parents will be <br/>\nthere and it will be a good place for Holly to show them some cool stuff.  <br/>\nBut mostly, I was wanting to take my husband there and show him a new thing <br/>\nthey have.  It&#39;s a low, short &quot;pan&quot;  (round wood sides maybe 3&#39; across, a <br/>\nfoot deep) with a rubber bottom and a motor under one side vibrating it.    <br/>\nOn that surface is about 1/4&quot; of sand (two colors) and small gravel.  You can <br/>\nmix them all together and spread them out evenly, but the effect of the <br/>\nvibrations is that the sand and gravel separate, in patterns you can figure <br/>\nout if you watch it long enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe display has no sign, no instructions, it&#39;s just there like a toy, like a <br/>\npiece of art.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mom (a stranger) and I sat and played with it for a long time.  We <br/>\nfigured out it&#39;s showing plate tectonics (an uber-geological concept about <br/>\nhow large land masses move), in part, and sort of being a glacier (as to how <br/>\nrocks come to be ejected from glacial masses, and pile up in certain <br/>\npatterns).   Because it doesn&#39;t say 1/4&quot; deep after a while.  It builds a <br/>\ncouple of mountains, in the same places every time.  Maybe 2&quot; high or more.  <br/>\nAnd they&#39;re pulling gravel up into them, and each piece pops up the top, <br/>\nrolls down the hill, and joins a clean pile of gravel.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter if kids &quot;know&quot; what they&#39;re learning there--they&#39;re <br/>\nlearning!  In face it there were display cards tying it with real-world <br/>\nstuff, it would no longer be just a really cool, artsy toy!<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, if at home you set up a little placard next to the sand box about <br/>\nthe benefits of playing in wet sand and dry, and one next the swing set about <br/>\nphysics and exercise, and one next to the television with the history of <br/>\ntheatre and popular entertainment, you would be turning a perfectly cool <br/>\nworld into a sad kind of school project.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of talking about unschooling, just do it.  It takes a while.  You <br/>\ndon&#39;t see it in one day or a week.  You might not see it in two months.  But <br/>\nif it&#39;s happening it&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a bunch of pumpkins and morning glories just sprouted.
