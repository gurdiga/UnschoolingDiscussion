How much of the system to you feel<br/>\nis worthwhile?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, I took a scientific computing course in college from an<br/>\nemeritus professor who&#39;s whole life was his research.  He maintained<br/>\nformal ties to the college in order to get access to computing<br/>\nfacilities and suchlike, and the college pretty much left him alone to<br/>\ndo his thing because he published great stuff.  Every now and again he<br/>\nwould teach this course, and it would basically be a series of lectures<br/>\nabout the current state of the art in research in a bunch of areas of<br/>\nscientific computing, and students would pick research problems and try<br/>\nto make progress on them.  He always told the class at the beginning<br/>\nthat he was going to give everyone an A, and he always followed<br/>\nthrough.

The first draft is to get your ideas out.  Then you modify your ideas.  Then you go over with a fine tooth comb for spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  Then you have someone else check it and you fix any errors they found.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of peer editing and editors.  Professional writers always have someone else go over their stuff, both for content and accuracy.  My favorite writing prof had us edit each other in the class and also hand in 3 drafts of each assignment before the final paper.  English and writing weren&#39;t my major, but I took extra classes from her because I enjoyed the first one I took from her so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormat does matter.  If a student bothers to take care with spelling, punctuation, and grammar, it is easier for the prof to focus on whether the assignment accomplished what it was supposed to.  However, as someone else said, if the student covers the assignment well and bothers to edit, the prof will be likely to overlook minor details such as exact word count.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for total length, OSU required lots of majors to take a particular technical writing course.  Most of the teachers assigned 20 page papers for the final project.  The teacher I had assigned a 5 page final.  He said nobody in the business world has time to read lengthy reports.

Most kids <br/>\nwant to know &quot;what&#39;s required&quot; so they can do that and no more. By stating what a <br/>\nparagraph &quot;is&quot; in no unequivocal terms, the student cannot just say to the teacher he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how long the teacher was expecting... and so it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Kirby writes *well* and is in depth in his support (if his syntax is strong and clear and <br/>\nnatural) those &quot;rules&quot; won&#39;t even be noticed by the teacher, nine times out of ten.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I told Kirby just not to count.

I would suggest not worrying too much about all the details <br/>\nor the professor. Instead, use the professor to get what he needs to become an effective <br/>\nwriter. My husband teaches freshman comp (has for fifteen years). I teach composition too <br/>\nand substitute at the college level.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat impresses teachers the most (imho) is a student who is eager to learn, who takes <br/>\ninput seriously and who is wanting to improve the piece because it can be improved, not <br/>\nbecause he needs a better grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost comp professors love to teach and wish more students loved to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; His handwritten language is very tacky looking and hard to read, and he types <br/>\n&gt; fast and well.  He&#39;s still iffy on the commas and apostrophes and quotation <br/>\n&gt; marks.  He usedtoo many quotation marks on his hand-written first draft, and he <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t use paragraphs, but there were some good phrases and most of them <br/>\n&gt; ended up in the final, though it had a different slant.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For first drafts, that will work. But it is a deterrent to reading quality writing (prose) if it&#39;s a <br/>\nmess mechanically. Just a fact of human nature. I would work as his editor (as his mom) <br/>\nand help him to make corrections before turning in the final draft.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Just noticed Kirby answered another question.<br/>\n&gt; He wrote about three personal attributes HE admired.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How could he explain why Maya Angelou admires the traits?

It&#39;s a fair <br/>\nquestion I think.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If he&#39;s marked down for that, I&#39;m liberating him.

(Good for him all the way <br/>\n&gt; around.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maya Angelou wouldn&#39;t get a good grade on her essay if she had written it for <br/>\n&gt; this class, if the teacher is going to be as much a stickler for her <br/>\n&gt; particular rules as she claims to be.  And Kirby says the teacher keeps mentioning <br/>\n&gt; Stephen King.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had some paragraphs shorter than 100 words, and kept <br/>\n&gt; a lot of his thesis to himself so the reader can do some of the thinking.  <br/>\n&gt; (Yeah, yeah... novels and not essays.  Still, being a person who has habitually <br/>\n&gt; written essays designed to get people to think, I don&#39;t think writing until <br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s nothing left to discover makes the best essay.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lol.

When I don&#39;t have small children to raise <br/>\nand a house to build, I sometimes work part time as a biology instructor <br/>\nat TVI (the same place where Kirby is going).  I teach courses for <br/>\nbiology majors and for non-majors, and by far my favorite is Biology 100 <br/>\nfor non-majors.  In this course I am able to offer a semester long <br/>\nproject where the students can choose to either write a paper or <br/>\nvolunteer at a local agency that is involved in biology in some way.  <br/>\nTVI sponsors this program, which is known as &quot;experiential learning&quot; <br/>\n(which totally cracks me up now that I have a better understanding of <br/>\nunschooling).  Anyway, since I have learned more about unschooling I <br/>\nhave been thinking of ways to apply some of the principles of <br/>\nunschooling to a college course, especially an introductory one like <br/>\nthis (the one for majors is pretty inflexible in terms of assessment).  <br/>\nI&#39;d like the students to know that I trust that they will learn as much <br/>\nor as little as they desire.  Some of them are in the course because <br/>\nthey want to be, while others are there to fulfill a requirement.  I <br/>\nhave some broad thoughts about how I might approach this, which I&#39;ll run <br/>\nby y&#39;all later, but right now I&#39;m wondering if anyone else out there <br/>\nteaches in a traditional setting with required syllabi, testing, and so <br/>\non.

Kate is<br/>\nalso taking classes, not her first, but her first at the college she&#39;s<br/>\nplanning on getting her degree from. It&#39;s been an interesting transition.<br/>\nAnd mostly positive.  Like Kirby, she&#39;s never had academic deadlines, never<br/>\nhad to get up for school (oh, the comments I&#39;ve heard-&quot;how will she know how<br/>\nto get up when she has to work?&quot;). She followed her interests and lived<br/>\nlife. Now she is taking three classes, works two jobs, volunteers.  She has<br/>\nyet to be late for class, is far more contientious than I ever was about<br/>\ndoing homework and is complaining about a teacher because she figured out in<br/>\nthe first week that in the psych class you don&#39;t have to do any reading if<br/>\nyou go to class and listen. Homework is answering questions by lifting the<br/>\ncorrect paragraph from the book. No thinking required. Kate says it&#39;s a<br/>\nwaste....but she needs the class.  And I think these discussions are<br/>\napplicable to unschooling because so many parents have fears of what will<br/>\nhappen when the kids get older.  I know I did. I heard all kinds of horror<br/>\nstories about what could happen if my children didn&#39;t learn at a young age<br/>\nhow to get up with an alarm, how to structure their day, if they didn&#39;t have<br/>\ndeadlines and rules to get used to....none of the dire predictions have come<br/>\ntrue.

Kirby is  18 and taking a few classes at the<br/>\ncommunity<br/>\n  college.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kirby loves his math class.  When they&#39;ve had in-class things they&#39;ve<br/>\nscored,<br/>\n  he&#39;s gotten 8 out of ten and 7 out of ten.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  He likes the college success class.  Today they made 3x5 cards of their<br/>\n  priority projects.  Here&#39;s what his says:<br/>\n  1  Work on my essey     (he misspelled it)<br/>\n  Get a place to do it<br/>\n  Get moms help<br/>\n  follow the step by step walkthrough<br/>\n  Do it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hadn&#39;t seen that before he came in today and asked me to help him with<br/>\nhis<br/>\n  English homework.<br/>\n  It&#39;s due Wednesday.<br/>\n  I asked if we could do it in the library,our upstairs room, which has a<br/>\nclean<br/>\n  table this week.  (I didn&#39;t know he had a list that said &#39;get a place.&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I saw his pages and PAGES of instructions and policies and samples, I<br/>\n  was not a bit hopeful.  I thought there was no way it would be finished in<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n  I have singing practice tomorrow night.  He has math tomorrow, and karate<br/>\n  for hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The assignment was daunting and the details were making me cranky and I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  trying to be calm and hopeful and peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He needed a &quot;sentence outline.&quot;  The sample we finally found in the depths<br/>\nof<br/>\n  his stuff was unclear, but we did one.  I could&#39;ve guessed wrong.   I<br/>\nthought<br/>\n  that would be a stopping place, but Kirby was upstairs writing while I was<br/>\n  downstairs printing the outline.  My computer&#39;s the only one with a<br/>\nprinter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s finished!  Finished a day and a half early.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I never finished anything a day and a half early when I was in college.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Two things bother me:  This is the kind of English class to make people<br/>\n  despise English classes.  I&#39;m sad about that.   It&#39;s over-blown pomposity<br/>\nand<br/>\n  obfuscation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second thing:<br/>\n  &quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is not qualified, no &quot;for the purposes of this class,&quot; or anything.<br/>\n  There it is, just as though it&#39;s fact, law, definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And furthermore, it&#39;s in a paragraph that&#39;s maybe 45 words long.  But here<br/>\nit<br/>\n  is with its explanation:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.  Short paragraphs result<br/>\nin<br/>\n  inadequate development of your thesis.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I told Kirby just not to count.  I told him if it&#39;s interesting enough,<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  teacher won&#39;t count.<br/>\n  Now I hope I&#39;m right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have the urge to liberate him, &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s still having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve read LOTS and lots of long paragraphs which were the result of lack<br/>\nof<br/>\n  friggin&#39; CLUE about thesis or development, but reeked of the<br/>\nhyperawareness of<br/>\n  word count.<br/>\n<br/>\n  His handwritten language is very tacky looking and hard to read, and he<br/>\ntypes<br/>\n  fast and well.  He&#39;s still iffy on the commas and apostrophes and<br/>\nquotation<br/>\n  marks.  He usedtoo many quotation marks on his hand-written first draft,<br/>\nand he<br/>\n  didn&#39;t use paragraphs, but there were some good phrases and most of them<br/>\n  ended up in the final, though it had a different slant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here&#39;s the assignment:<br/>\n<br/>\n  **<br/>\n  &quot;New Directions,&quot; by Maya Angelou, is a narrative essay about Mrs. Annie<br/>\n  Johnson, an African-American woman who lived int he American South one<br/>\nhundred<br/>\n  years ago.  Identify at least three personal attributes that the author<br/>\nobviously<br/>\n  admires in this woman.  Explain why she admires these traits.  Use<br/>\nexamples<br/>\n  from the text to support your statements.<br/>\n  **<br/>\n<br/>\n  Huh.<br/>\n  Just noticed Kirby answered another question.<br/>\n  He wrote about three personal attributes HE admired.<br/>\n<br/>\n  How could he explain why Maya Angelou admires the traits?  He would be<br/>\n  guessing, not explaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If he&#39;s marked down for that, I&#39;m liberating him.  Might need some<br/>\nninja-moms<br/>\n  to help me...<br/>\n  (No, probably I&#39;ll just let him do what he wants to do, as usual.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s finished,and it didn&#39;t take all the hours I thought<br/>\nit<br/>\n  would, and that he rejected some of my ideas.  (Good for him all the way<br/>\n  around.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maya Angelou wouldn&#39;t get a good grade on her essay if she had written it<br/>\nfor<br/>\n  this class, if the teacher is going to be as much a stickler for her<br/>\n  particular rules as she claims to be.  And Kirby says the teacher keeps<br/>\nmentioning<br/>\n  Stephen King.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had some paragraphs shorter than 100 words,<br/>\nand kept<br/>\n  a lot of his thesis to himself so the reader can do some of the thinking.<br/>\n  (Yeah, yeah... novels and not essays.  Still, being a person who has<br/>\nhabitually<br/>\n  written essays designed to get people to think, I don&#39;t think writing<br/>\nuntil<br/>\n  there&#39;s nothing left to discover makes the best essay.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m really sorry for even writing this.  I&#39;m torn between reporting this<br/>\n  stuff and just not saying any schoolish thing ever, EVER, on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yuck, and I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  Yahoo!

Kirby is  18 and taking a few classes at the community <br/>\ncollege.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby loves his math class.  When they&#39;ve had in-class things they&#39;ve scored, <br/>\nhe&#39;s gotten 8 out of ten and 7 out of ten.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes the college success class.  Today they made 3x5 cards of their <br/>\npriority projects.  Here&#39;s what his says: <br/>\n1  Work on my essey     (he misspelled it)<br/>\nGet a place to do it<br/>\nGet moms help<br/>\nfollow the step by step walkthrough<br/>\nDo it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t seen that before he came in today and asked me to help him with his <br/>\nEnglish homework.<br/>\nIt&#39;s due Wednesday.  <br/>\nI asked if we could do it in the library,our upstairs room, which has a clean <br/>\ntable this week.  (I didn&#39;t know he had a list that said &#39;get a place.&#39;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I saw his pages and PAGES of instructions and policies and samples, I <br/>\nwas not a bit hopeful.  I thought there was no way it would be finished in time. <br/>\n I have singing practice tomorrow night.  He has math tomorrow, and karate <br/>\nfor hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe assignment was daunting and the details were making me cranky and I was <br/>\ntrying to be calm and hopeful and peaceful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe needed a &quot;sentence outline.&quot;  The sample we finally found in the depths of <br/>\nhis stuff was unclear, but we did one.  I could&#39;ve guessed wrong.   I thought <br/>\nthat would be a stopping place, but Kirby was upstairs writing while I was <br/>\ndownstairs printing the outline.  My computer&#39;s the only one with a printer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s finished!  Finished a day and a half early.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never finished anything a day and a half early when I was in college.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things bother me:  This is the kind of English class to make people <br/>\ndespise English classes.  I&#39;m sad about that.   It&#39;s over-blown pomposity and <br/>\nobfuscation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond thing: <br/>\n&quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not qualified, no &quot;for the purposes of this class,&quot; or anything.  <br/>\nThere it is, just as though it&#39;s fact, law, definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd furthermore, it&#39;s in a paragraph that&#39;s maybe 45 words long.  But here it <br/>\nis with its explanation:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.  Short paragraphs result in <br/>\ninadequate development of your thesis.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI told Kirby just not to count.  I told him if it&#39;s interesting enough, the <br/>\nteacher won&#39;t count.  <br/>\nNow I hope I&#39;m right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have the urge to liberate him, &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s still having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read LOTS and lots of long paragraphs which were the result of lack of <br/>\nfriggin&#39; CLUE about thesis or development, but reeked of the hyperawareness of <br/>\nword count.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis handwritten language is very tacky looking and hard to read, and he types <br/>\nfast and well.  He&#39;s still iffy on the commas and apostrophes and quotation <br/>\nmarks.  He usedtoo many quotation marks on his hand-written first draft, and he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t use paragraphs, but there were some good phrases and most of them <br/>\nended up in the final, though it had a different slant.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the assignment:<br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\n&quot;New Directions,&quot; by Maya Angelou, is a narrative essay about Mrs. Annie <br/>\nJohnson, an African-American woman who lived int he American South one hundred <br/>\nyears ago.  Identify at least three personal attributes that the author obviously <br/>\nadmires in this woman.  Explain why she admires these traits.  Use examples <br/>\nfrom the text to support your statements.<br/>\n**<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.  <br/>\nJust noticed Kirby answered another question.<br/>\nHe wrote about three personal attributes HE admired.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could he explain why Maya Angelou admires the traits?  He would be <br/>\nguessing, not explaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s marked down for that, I&#39;m liberating him.  Might need some ninja-moms <br/>\nto help me...<br/>\n(No, probably I&#39;ll just let him do what he wants to do, as usual.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t believe it&#39;s finished,and it didn&#39;t take all the hours I thought it <br/>\nwould, and that he rejected some of my ideas.  (Good for him all the way <br/>\naround.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaya Angelou wouldn&#39;t get a good grade on her essay if she had written it for <br/>\nthis class, if the teacher is going to be as much a stickler for her <br/>\nparticular rules as she claims to be.  And Kirby says the teacher keeps mentioning <br/>\nStephen King.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had some paragraphs shorter than 100 words, and kept <br/>\na lot of his thesis to himself so the reader can do some of the thinking.  <br/>\n(Yeah, yeah... novels and not essays.  Still, being a person who has habitually <br/>\nwritten essays designed to get people to think, I don&#39;t think writing until <br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing left to discover makes the best essay.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really sorry for even writing this.  I&#39;m torn between reporting this <br/>\nstuff and just not saying any schoolish thing ever, EVER, on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nYuck, and I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102774,"nextTopicId":102793}}
