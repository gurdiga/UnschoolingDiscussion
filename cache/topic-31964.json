Perhaps it is a myth, but I know that who I am has its roots in<br/>\n&gt; who I was from the very beginning of my life, and I still remain affected<br/>\n&gt; by my responses to my situations in my earliest days.  None of us has a<br/>\n&gt; choice of circumstances in our lives when we are that small, but even<br/>\n&gt; then we react in different ways to it that influence our reactions to<br/>\n&gt; similar circumstances later on in life.<br/>\n&gt; People&#39;s behavior has to do with our subconscious beliefs which are<br/>\n&gt; almost inseparable from our early experiences.  Most of the people I know<br/>\n&gt; who have been drug addicts or abusive actually don&#39;t believe that they<br/>\n&gt; were abused (though they might say it because they&#39;ve been told so by<br/>\n&gt; psychologists and lawyers or to get on government assistance or out of<br/>\n&gt; jail) because they don&#39;t feel it.  And often when they accept that truth<br/>\n&gt; they can accept the truth that they have a problem and are responsible<br/>\n&gt; for it.  One denial leads to another, so to speak.  When we build a<br/>\n&gt; building, it is only as strong as its foundation.  Sometimes we need to<br/>\n&gt; rebuild the foundation, but we can&#39;t if we keep saying there is nothing<br/>\n&gt; wrong with it.<br/>\n&gt; But a bad beginning doesn&#39;t excuse us, it just means we might have more<br/>\n&gt; of a struggle in certain areas.  We are all responsible for what we<br/>\n&gt; accept as ours in terms of our beliefs.  I think someone who is hurting<br/>\n&gt; others deliberately has accepted into the heart something that is wrong<br/>\n&gt; rather than rejecting it, and usually because on a subconscious level<br/>\n&gt; they think it will somehow help in surviving.  But this can be changed by<br/>\n&gt; identifying the wrong belief and refusing to accept it anymore.  Then we<br/>\n&gt; can choose new beliefs that truly are helpful to ourselves and others.<br/>\n&gt; I know that probably what I am saying will get picked apart, and I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; be able to defend it with any scientific studies, but this is just my<br/>\n&gt; personal opinion based on my own science experiment, life.  I have never<br/>\n&gt; seen anyone who committed wrong behavior who didn&#39;t base it on a wrong<br/>\n&gt; belief.  And I have never seen anyone who changed their wrong behavior<br/>\n&gt; without also changing the wrong beliefs with truth.  The interesting<br/>\n&gt; thing to me is, the wrong belief didn&#39;t come from what anyone did or said<br/>\n&gt; to them as much as how they processed and chose to think of what was done<br/>\n&gt; or said to them.  So our belief comes from within us and we own it and it<br/>\n&gt; cannot be blamed on anyone else any more than wrong actions can be blamed<br/>\n&gt; on anyone else.<br/>\n&gt; Bonni<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Yes, so far I have seen it to be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean all children will be sweetness and light if we only parent<br/>\nproperly. Many children are high energy, loud, physical, demanding, quiet,<br/>\nintroverted and a whole host of other personality types that society deems<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;in need of correction&quot;. Often the &quot;problem&quot; isn&#39;t the child&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior so much as the parent&#39;s need to change the child into something he<br/>\nis not. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect even the most well meaning parents can turn out bad kids because<br/>\nthey parent by &quot;the rules&quot; (eg., the way kids are &quot;supposed&quot; to be raised)<br/>\nrather than expecting every chlld to be a unique individual with his own<br/>\nneeds, parents who try to shape and mold rather than listen and understand<br/>\nto help the child grow in the way he was meant to go. (It&#39;s even possible<br/>\nthat parents who do their best to understand or who try to protect their<br/>\nkids from a bad environment will be overwhelmed.) A free spirited child in a<br/>\nhome that is tightly controlled is undoubtedly at risk for turning bad. But<br/>\nno one would be able to pinpoint that the parents were to blame strictly<br/>\nfrom the type of parenting they did that thousands of other parents had used<br/>\nto turn out good kids. (At risk, too, is a child who wants a lot of guidance<br/>\nwhose parents are saying do with your life what you will. But society would<br/>\njump all over that type of parenting since it&#39;s assume that will always turn<br/>\nout bad kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1694471,"authorName":"Lynda","from":"&quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;","profile":"anoydami","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Good Choices","postDate":"1013500320","msgId":31984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZTIwMWMxYjM5YSQzMGMyZThlMCQxMjVkZDFkMUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGE0OTJocCtkN3NmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NS4wLjIuMS4wLjIwMDIwMjExMTYwMzU3LjAyOGY3MGEwQGxvY2FsaG9zdD4="},"prevInTopic":31983,"nextInTopic":31985,"prevInTime":31983,"nextInTime":31985,"topicId":31964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can works for me.  always doesn t.

My statement wasn&#39;t taking the<br/>\nnurture<br/>\n&gt; side of the nature vs. nurture debate. If you want to start another thread<br/>\n&gt; on that, perhaps there may be some people interested in debating it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was responding to the idea of whether or not it was useful to discuss<br/>\n&gt; hypothetical problems. If a hypothetical child is torturing animals, how<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; we discuss how to hypothetically handle it? Even if the child is Jeffrey<br/>\n&gt; Dahmer, there *is* a cause behind the behavior. It may be genetic. It may<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; biological. It may be chemical. It may be physical abuse. It may be<br/>\n&gt; psychological abuse. It may be a combination. Solutions must deal with the<br/>\n&gt; cause, not the symptoms. Abuse of animals -- and lying and bedwetting and<br/>\n&gt; pinching as well as a few thousand more things that kids could do -- is<br/>\nonly<br/>\n&gt; a symptom that could be caused by many different factors. And it&#39;s the<br/>\n&gt; factors that need to be examined, not the symptoms.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; part of what she questions<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be questioned, &quot;is everyone entirely honest about this.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a good question but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good answer! If someone<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; lying about her children then she&#39;s going to lie about whether she&#39;s being<br/>\n&gt; truthful ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hypothetically speaking we should treat *all* information we receive --<br/>\n&gt; whether it&#39;s from a list or message board or book or friend or newspaper<br/>\nor<br/>\n&gt; magazine or tv show or ... -- as open to question. People being people<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; will lie, simplify things to make a point clearer, let their enthusiasm<br/>\n&gt; paint a rosier picture, be mistaken regardless of the medium they use to<br/>\n&gt; tell their story through.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The information we get here should only be the beginning.

My statement wasn&#39;t taking the nurture<br/>\nside of the nature vs. nurture debate. If you want to start another thread<br/>\non that, perhaps there may be some people interested in debating it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was responding to the idea of whether or not it was useful to discuss<br/>\nhypothetical problems. If a hypothetical child is torturing animals, how can<br/>\nwe discuss how to hypothetically handle it? Even if the child is Jeffrey<br/>\nDahmer, there *is* a cause behind the behavior. It may be genetic. It may be<br/>\nbiological. It may be chemical. It may be physical abuse. It may be<br/>\npsychological abuse. It may be a combination. Solutions must deal with the<br/>\ncause, not the symptoms. Abuse of animals -- and lying and bedwetting and<br/>\npinching as well as a few thousand more things that kids could do -- is only<br/>\na symptom that could be caused by many different factors. And it&#39;s the<br/>\nfactors that need to be examined, not the symptoms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; part of what she questions<br/>\n&gt; should be questioned, &quot;is everyone entirely honest about this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a good question but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good answer! If someone is<br/>\nlying about her children then she&#39;s going to lie about whether she&#39;s being<br/>\ntruthful ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHypothetically speaking we should treat *all* information we receive --<br/>\nwhether it&#39;s from a list or message board or book or friend or newspaper or<br/>\nmagazine or tv show or ... -- as open to question. People being people they<br/>\nwill lie, simplify things to make a point clearer, let their enthusiasm<br/>\npaint a rosier picture, be mistaken regardless of the medium they use to<br/>\ntell their story through.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe information we get here should only be the beginning.
