The shock on their faces was amazing.  Of course, now they&#39;ll rationalize it and think my kids are &quot;different&quot; than theirs are, and no child except a &quot;different&quot; child would enjoy learning etc etc etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know the Brownie Leader is still concerned about my 8 year old who is not reading or writing.  And I know her ps friends have been giving her somewhat of a hard time too.   And my 15 year old does absolutely NO writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am facing the end of the school year soon, and the school district will be expecting writing samples for him to show &quot;sustained progress&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what we&#39;ll do about that yet.(I did check into some of your ideas Sandra, but basically he has absolutely no interest in any writing at all).  From the unschooling standpoint, I could care less if he doesn&#39;t produce anything in writing.   He is very articulate.  And its not hard to learn how to write a paper when there is a need to learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the district could very well breathe down my neck about it and that makes me feel like I&#39;m forced into a corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Melissa <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, February 07, 2004 12:54 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Identity Shift<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; Now <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I get questions like &quot;are you REALLY going to keep homeschooling <br/>\n  until the end of high school????&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  My DD is only 2.5 and I have people ask me (by people, I mean <br/>\n  family) &quot;so, when ARE you going to send her to school then?&quot;  Since <br/>\n  it is family and I am not shy about my opinions and no one wants to <br/>\n  get into an agrument with me, they usually shut up when I <br/>\n  say &quot;never, hopefully.&quot;  I do add that, if she wants to go to school <br/>\n  when she is older, I will talk it over with her and my DH and we <br/>\n  will see about it.
