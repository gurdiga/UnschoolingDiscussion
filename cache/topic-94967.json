Say to them, &quot;I&#39;ll play these board games <br/>\nwith you today, and I&#39;m also planning to read a chapter from this book <br/>\nright after lunch. What would you like to do during that time that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could offer to pop in a video tape or to have them also read to <br/>\nthemselves during that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year when life got crazy with activities and driving and TV and <br/>\ncomputers, I realized I needed some quiet. I asked the kids if they&#39;d <br/>\nmind if I lit a candle for half an hour and we used that half hour as a <br/>\nquiet time in the house. No music, TV, videos. Anyone could read or <br/>\nplay quietly in any room of the house, but no loud discussions or <br/>\nrunning through the house games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were willing. We did this for a couple weeks. It helped me when I <br/>\nneeded it. We stopped when it became irksome to the youngest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m realizing is that we need to help our kids to realize that we <br/>\nare humans who live with them and have needs/wants/limits too. This <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be oppressive or punitive or neglecting. It&#39;s just <br/>\nreal. They don&#39;t mind supporting a mom when she needs it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yet I still feel that pursuing my own<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; interests WILL be competing with my children&#39;s interests to some<br/>\n &gt; point.  From past experience, I know that they do.  Me pursuing my<br/>\n &gt; own interests almost always results in me telling the kids &quot;No&quot; at<br/>\n &gt; some point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you mean &quot;No&quot;? If you&#39;re making dinner, doesn&#39;t that mean you <br/>\ncan&#39;t play a game?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are peeing in the bathroom or taking a shower, doesn&#39;t that mean <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t available?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the only time your kids see you not with them is to do personal <br/>\nhygiene and care-taking, they will feel that you exist solely for their <br/>\nuse/entertainment. Then they resent you when you take time away from <br/>\nthem. But if you all live together in the home sharing interests, <br/>\nhelping pitch in to make lunch or clean up, life is lived for everyone, <br/>\nnot just for the sake of some.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; It&#39;s only 9:30 am and I already have a huge list of what the kids<br/>\n &gt; want to do with me today.  The list will get longer as we go further<br/>\n &gt; on in the day (it always does! lol).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why a list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; I need to pause a minute to breathe or I&#39;ll get really overwhelmed<br/>\n &gt; thinking about adding one of my own interests to this day. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the difference right there. It shouldn&#39;t be that you are adding <br/>\nanything. Your interests will naturally come out of you. For instance, <br/>\nhave you turned on a CD of music that you enjoy today? (Just put it on <br/>\nthe CD player-doesn&#39;t take time away from anyone.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you lit a candle or arranged a couple of flowers?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you put the talk radio show on that you like while you make lunch?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you leave an art book on the kitchen table open to a favorite <br/>\npainting and look at it each time you walk by?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to &quot;make time&quot; for interests as much as stay interested. <br/>\nStart tiny. I used to read while I nursed the baby. I miss that time so <br/>\nmuch, actually. When your kids color pictures, use real art pencils so <br/>\nthat you can color with them and make something really pretty for you. <br/>\nTape it to the refrigerator.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick out some videos at the library that you like and watch them with <br/>\nyour kids. If they say &quot;boring&quot; let them know that you are going to <br/>\nwatch five or ten minutes of it and then play the board game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is this. What a mom often means when she says she doesn&#39;t have <br/>\ntime to pursue her interests is that she has lost touch with what <br/>\ninterests her because her life has become so consumed with the primary <br/>\ninterest: raising children. Guilt prevents remembering what she liked <br/>\n(what colors, music, movies, hand crafts etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut over time, a slow burn grows until one day depression is often the <br/>\nresult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, kids grow up and need you less and then it&#39;s easy to resent their <br/>\ngrowing independence.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; I don&#39;t get when people say, &quot;I do my thing and when they need me, I<br/>\n &gt; stop and help them and then go back to my own thing&quot;.  Because when I<br/>\n &gt; stop to help them they have me helping them all day long.  That&#39;s not<br/>\n &gt; an exaggeration.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps your kids are used to that lifestyle. What if they began to see <br/>\nyou emerge? What if they discovered they could help mom pick out her <br/>\nfavorite CDs at the library? My daughter used to find art books for me <br/>\nwhen she was only 5 knowing that I loved to look at them. It goes both <br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I had this resolved in my own head, that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; that&#39;s just the way things are, that I need to accept it and<br/>\n &gt; appreciate that they want to be with me so much, that they won&#39;t be<br/>\n &gt; little forever so appreciate while it lasts.  Now you have me<br/>\n &gt; doubting that again. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s both. You&#39;ll never get this time back as a mother or as an adult <br/>\nat whatever age you are.

I had<br/>\n &gt; read about people doing this and it interested me a lot.
