The challenge<br/>\nof figuring out a new game is definitely his current joy.  We went to a<br/>\ndifferent Blockbuster a couple days ago and now there&#39;s a whole new set of<br/>\ngames for him to try (seems the one closest to us doesn&#39;t have as much<br/>\nselection).  He&#39;s excited to try out three new games, one a week, over the<br/>\nnext three weeks.  And he&#39;s trying to balance that with maintaining his<br/>\nFF-XI character level growth along with the friends he&#39;s found online. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a couple years ago he ran into another person at a party who was<br/>\njust as into video games as himself and they spent the evening chatting<br/>\nabout them.  He told me one of the things they talked about how much they<br/>\nlearn from playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as mentioned in the article he&#39;s now moved into developing his own<br/>\ngames.  When he was younger it was mostly storylines and drawing characters<br/>\nand bosses but now he&#39;s using RPG Maker to create his own games.  He also is<br/>\nnow more interested in the industry itself, watching X-Play to get a feel<br/>\nfor the whole genre, not just the games he likes playing (RPGs), and surfing<br/>\nmessage boards and fan sites online.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really amazing to watch his interest unfold and all the great learning<br/>\nthat happens along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L - Woohoo!

So they say to themselves, &quot;The kids like to play <br/>\ngames, we want them to learn multiplication tables, so everyone will be <br/>\nhappy if we make games that teach multiplication.&quot; The result is shown <br/>\nin a rash of ads that go like this: &quot;Our Software Is So Much Fun That <br/>\nThe Kids Don&#39;t Even Know That They Are Learning&quot; or &quot;Our Games Make <br/>\nMath Easy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe language of these ads betrays the way in which this software throws <br/>\naway what is best about the contribution of game designers to the <br/>\nlearning environment and replaces it with what is worst about the <br/>\ncontribution of school curriculum designers. What is best about the <br/>\nbest games is that they draw kids into some very hard learning.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat article.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94086,"nextTopicId":94102}}
