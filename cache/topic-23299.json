","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-716476101\">There&#39;s a kind of building set called Ramagon.  Discovery Toys used to sell <br/>\nthem and still might.  They&#39;re pricey, but worth it.  Maybe there&#39;s a web <br/>\nsource?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have two sets.  They&#39;re Lego-compatible, meaning some of the flat surfaces <br/>\nare made with the lego base-mat mold pattern (Lego guys can stand on them, <br/>\nyou can put Lego pieces on them).  You can make space ships for your Lego men.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a different kind of construction, with angles, cross pieces, wheels... <br/>\nhard to describe.  I&#39;ll look for a link to pictures if they&#39;re still being <br/>\nmade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23280,"nextTopicId":23302}}
