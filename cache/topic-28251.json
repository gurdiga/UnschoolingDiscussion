I don&#39;t HAVE to nag and rush Julian out or to bed...we no <br/>\nlonger have to fight about homework. If we do have a conflict, we have time <br/>\nto work it out. Our relationship is better because we have time to give it <br/>\nthe attention it needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s neat is that I find that parents seem to respond to that most--more <br/>\nthan socialization, or being able to teach astrophysics, or organization <br/>\ndeficits. Parents WANT to like their kids, and I think they&#39;re sad when they <br/>\nfind themselves unable to. Here&#39;s a chance!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28177,"nextTopicId":28254}}
