Not just me.  I responded to some that I <br/>\nthought I would like to participate in the discussion with.  Not all my posts <br/>\nare questions nor are anyone else&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we should just set a limit about how many times one can respond to any <br/>\ngiven subject and how many questions one should ask per day per week or <br/>\nmonth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I subject is going down a path that someone might be questioning and I <br/>\ncan contribute I will.  If someone doesn&#39;t want to read it, then don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only person who&#39;s eyes were opened to <br/>\nthreats being out there that are against unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also commented about not knowing the &quot;church&quot;played such a part in <br/>\ndestroying others lives.  I said I know about abuse, I know it happens in <br/>\nfamilies who go to church (like mine) but it wasn&#39;t because the Church <br/>\ndictated that my parents be like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought was how maybe many abusive parents actually HIDE in a church <br/>\nsomehow hoping to in some sense make what they do to their kids OK.  After <br/>\nall they ARE in church and isn&#39;t that the measure of a &quot;good&quot; person in the <br/>\neyes of the community.  Well, not always but on the surface, especially in <br/>\nthe South &quot;my but they were such a nice churchgoing family!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to beg the question maybe it&#39;s really the people and not the &quot;cloak&quot; of <br/>\nChristianity that they wear that is the root of the abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question (and this is theoretical, I don&#39;t think anyone really has the <br/>\nanswer) is would these families that are so restrictive and abusive behave <br/>\nany differently to their children if they did NOT attend church?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they would be the same.  I&#39;m sure there are some instances where this <br/>\nisn&#39;t true as in all things but something I wonder about...<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"posting too much without any useful input","postDate":"1050252300","msgId":64662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwLjFiMjVlYjJmLjJiY2FlZTBjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64669,"prevInTime":64661,"nextInTime":64663,"topicId":64662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/13/03 9:22:22 AM, rubyprincesstsg@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1777951127\">In a message dated 4/13/03 9:22:22 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Just as I&#39;ve seen here if you don&#39;t want to read it, hit the delete key.  <br/>\nI <br/>\ndon&#39;t care if some choose to hit delete every time they see my screen name in <br/>\nan email.
