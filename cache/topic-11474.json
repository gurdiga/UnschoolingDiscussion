Which is why we do what we do. I&#39;m sure I have at least one<br/>\nlearning disability. Unfortunatly, these things were not easily diagnosed 30<br/>\nyears ago. My oldest daughter is dyslexic, ADD, and has processing speed<br/>\ndisorder. I&#39;m glad we knew early on that school is the wrong place for kids<br/>\nlike her. I had a miserable kindergartener. Now I&#39;ve got a bright, vibrant,<br/>\nhappy second grader. I&#39;m so glad we &quot;saw the light&quot;. Hopefully, you will go<br/>\non to live a happy and fufilled adulthood. I&#39;m sure your input on this list<br/>\nwill be appreciated (although some folks might like it if you tone down your<br/>\nlanguage a bit-some of us have little ones ahnging around the computer with<br/>\nus).<br/>\nWelcome Again,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\nunschooling mom to 3 girls<br/>\nSamantha 7, Dana 4, Casey 2<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Jonathan Mooney &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jonathanmooney@...\">jonathanmooney@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, July 22, 2000 2:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: introduction<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hey all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; righ off the bat you&#39;ll going to have to excuse the spelling of anything i<br/>\n&gt; post--i just a little on the dyslixic side of things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have a little confushion to make. I am 22 just over the teen list<br/>\n&gt; age. But i thought i&#39;d indroduce myself, my work, and see if you&#39;ll will<br/>\n&gt; make an exception. I joined the list becuase i had a fucking nightmare<br/>\n&gt; exsperince in school and i feel that i could be a resouce for people in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; unschooling population who stuggle wiht Learning disabities.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was diagnossed with Dyslixia in four grade and depression as a reulst of<br/>\n&gt; living in fucking systmes that can not understand diffrence. I did not<br/>\n&gt; actually learn to read untill i was 12--at that point the shame,<br/>\n&gt; hummilation, and anger that felt towards a school system that was<br/>\n&gt; systemcially teaching me that i was worthless and stupid was to much to<br/>\n&gt; bear--i dorped out with the support of my partents completly. i have to<br/>\nsay<br/>\n&gt; that perioed was one of the most difficult times in mylife--sucicde was<br/>\n&gt; cerntently on my mind most of the time. our schools have so much power and<br/>\n&gt; this power if very rearlly quested--in the end they are more concered with<br/>\n&gt; socilzaing conformaty then empowering people as thinkers. But when you are<br/>\n&gt; 12 that shit is to hard to understand specfically when the common<br/>\n&gt; assocation with a learning disabilty is that you are stupid that spelling<br/>\n&gt; is a direct indication of how your minds works.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But my story does that end there. I was lucky to be a gifted soccer player<br/>\n&gt; and reenrooled under that pignoned indenty which schools are so quick to<br/>\n&gt; give out. I ended up barging graduating and reviving a school<br/>\nscholarship....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But i decided to drop soccer a go with of all things writing (there is a<br/>\n&gt; lot of shit left out here in the abriged vershion--problmes wiht achohall,<br/>\n&gt; a coulpe of artsest, tranfersing unversityies, you the good stuff). Now I<br/>\n&gt; am a recent graduate for Brown University and author of the forth coming<br/>\n&gt; book entitled Learning Outside the Lines (Simon & Schuster, September<br/>\n&gt; 2000). It book is based on the success stories of me and my co-author. It<br/>\n&gt; starts with my journey from being a sixth grade drop and  then turns to my<br/>\n&gt; co-author--diagnosed with ADHD in second grade, high school drop out<br/>\nturned<br/>\n&gt; IVY league student also. Together we then explore and outline the learning<br/>\n&gt; strategies that we have used to be successful as alternative learns, to be<br/>\n&gt; successful as people learn out side the lines.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This book dirctly attacks that fucked things about ourschools and its<br/>\ngoals<br/>\n&gt; it to outline a road map for learning outside the lines, it takes the<br/>\n&gt; reader on a journey towards personal empowerment and profound educational<br/>\n&gt; change.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I believe that all kids deserve an education that is about freedom,<br/>\n&gt; empowerment, and educational revolution. you guys have mad courge for<br/>\n&gt; pursing an education that is fucking truly outside the lines. i wish this<br/>\n&gt; tyep of enviorment would of been around for me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; if i can be of any help, around the issue of ld, or aroudn the isseu of<br/>\n&gt; going to college after untraditional education please feel free to<br/>\ncontatct<br/>\n&gt; any time. here is my contact information:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; address: 46 E29th St. New York, New York 0016<br/>\n&gt; work: 212-889-1868<br/>\n&gt; cell: 917-553-4820<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; cheers all<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jonathan Mooney<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Visit www.ibelieve.com  today and get a FREE book by Chuck Swindoll!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964291858/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/6182/14/_/448294/_/964291858/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11472,"nextTopicId":11475}}
