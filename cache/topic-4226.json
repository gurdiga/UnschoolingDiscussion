He seems to be good at achieving a balance.  He&#39;ll <br/>\ndecide that he&#39;s getting frustrated because he&#39;s been on too long and <br/>\nwill switch to another activity.  I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re striving <br/>\nfor - trying to achieve that healthy balance.  I guess my question <br/>\nwould be - what is he doing when he&#39;s on the computer?  Is he <br/>\non the internet?  We have an agreement that my son will let me know <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s online and we frequently review safety measures for the <br/>\ninternet.  Also,  what role is the computer playing.  Does he stay on <br/>\nfor hours because he really enjoys it,  or is he avoiding doing other <br/>\nthings, escaping, etc.  I think these are the same questions we would <br/>\nask ourselves if caught up intensely in an activity.  I would talk to <br/>\nhim about balance, etc.  If he&#39;s not a long time unschooler,  this <br/>\nmight be the way he&#39;s deschooling.  Just some thoughts.....<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane in KS</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Strandbe@xxx.xxx","from":"Strandbe@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hVmOtXb1UqkUXxMt0ekEzSZL4OuP87ElwlGwxCshXI74ciC-8HAE_5FMEaYZBKgg2r4RuTzHMg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Single mother/computer-obsessed son","postDate":"941773028","msgId":4226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yODEuNDIyNi45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4228,"prevInTime":4225,"nextInTime":4227,"topicId":4226,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A friend of mine asked me if I d post a question for her: She s a single parent and works about three full days a week.
