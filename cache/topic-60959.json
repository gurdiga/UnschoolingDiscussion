For example,<br/>\n  we&#39;ve had trouble with scissors in our house this year with my daughter<br/>\n  and her cousin. It started when they cut off my daughter&#39;s long<br/>\n  beautiful hair. They also cut the cord on the blinds, and cut up a few<br/>\n  things in the house. In short order they were banned from scissors.<br/>\n  Recently they were doing a craft with our Japanese student, and they<br/>\n  were left with scissors, and alas, again cut something. This time our<br/>\n  futon chair cover. They are 4 and 5 years old - so they&#39;re certainly old<br/>\n  enough to know that this isn&#39;t a good choice. I got mad at them and then<br/>\n  I told them if they cannot make good choices when no one is watching<br/>\n  them, then they would have to be watched all the time. I made them stick<br/>\n  right by my side. When I was working on the computer they sat on the<br/>\n  floor beside me reading a book. Then I made them come downstairs to get<br/>\n  a load of laundry. We&#39;d sit in the family room to fold it and I let them<br/>\n  watch TV while I did it - but I would purposefully get up right when<br/>\n  they were really getting into it and say, &quot;Okay. Time to go into the<br/>\n  kitchen.&quot; Or wherever. They didn&#39;t dare complain because they knew the<br/>\n  gravity of what they had done and knew they didn&#39;t have any room for<br/>\n  negotiation. We only had to do this for about 3 hours until they begged<br/>\n  me to trust them again. So we did it for the next 3 hours in a little<br/>\n  more limited sense. The lesson stuck. We haven&#39;t had a problem with<br/>\n  scissors for a long time. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When my husband and his siblings weren&#39;t getting along my MIL would make<br/>\n  them hold hands or sit on chairs with their knees touching, until they<br/>\n  talked and solved whatever the problem was. I&#39;m actually quite amazed at<br/>\n  how they get along in his family. They just were plain not allowed to be<br/>\n  unkind to each other. It doesn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t have<br/>\n  disagreements - but unkindness was not tolerated. I hope we can do that<br/>\n  in our family with our children as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Another thing that comes to my mind is to have a theme of the week or<br/>\n  day, or whatever seems appropriate. Have a phrase that you ask them to<br/>\n  say to you. For example, my daughter has one lately that she got from a<br/>\n  book that says, &quot;I&#39;ll be happy all day if I obey.&quot; I&#39;m surprised<br/>\n  actually how many times she comes back to the little quip. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\n  something I started - she got it out of a book - but she has really made<br/>\n  it stick in her mind and the process has made me think it might be<br/>\n  worthwhile to come up with some more of those in our home. Not sure what<br/>\n  they&#39;ll be yet. I&#39;d like something right now that helps them remember to<br/>\n  clean up toys!! But that&#39;s an entirely different thread. :0)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good for you for reaching out and asking for help. Some people just<br/>\n  figure kids fight and that&#39;s life. I don&#39;t think it has to be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a>] <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 11, 2003 5:58 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] parenting dilemmas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is a toughie and it&#39;s something we&#39;ve worked on avoiding with our<br/>\n  own <br/>\n  kids.  (and its&#39; worked!) So, know that it IS possible to have kids who <br/>\n  don&#39;t torment each other.  It&#39;s not something that you can just <br/>\n  plug-in-and-play, but is rather a paradigm shift in how you think about <br/>\n  relationships.  I don&#39;t know you, and I don&#39;t know your kids, so I&#39;m<br/>\n  just <br/>\n  going to throw stuff out there to be thought about.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Firstly, you&#39;ve read and ingested and re-read Adelle Fabers&#39; books, <br/>\n  right?  The whole &#39;learn to talk so kids will listen&#39; thing?  It&#39;s<br/>\n  really <br/>\n  helped us out with learning how to talk with our kids and identifying <br/>\n  subtly aggressive behavior, which means we can deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Secondly, do some work on self-assertiveness for Yourself.  I&#39;m<br/>\n  wondering <br/>\n  if sometimes it&#39;s difficult for you to say when something is not feeling<br/>\n<br/>\n  right for you and sitting that child down to peacefully talk it over<br/>\n  with <br/>\n  them so you can understand WHY they want to write that their brother is <br/>\n  stupid and WHY they were trying to trick you into doing something you <br/>\n  didn&#39;t want to do (ie, write that the brother was stupid) and thereby <br/>\n  facilitating the other brother&#39;s being mean to the younger brother.  I <br/>\n  mean, there&#39;s a Whole LOT of discussion that needs to go on about that<br/>\n  with <br/>\n  the child in question (and not in a mean way, but in a gently<br/>\n  inquisitive <br/>\n  way, to find out what they&#39;re thinking and how they got to think that <br/>\n  way.)  Then you both/all need to talk about how it&#39;s making you, the<br/>\n  mommy, <br/>\n  feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d also suggest doing some work on family inter-dependence, that is, <br/>\n  emphasizing how one family member can be affected by another family<br/>\n  member <br/>\n  because of the love within the family and talking about it with great <br/>\n  concern for BOTH parties (because after all, if family won&#39;t stick up<br/>\n  for <br/>\n  or care for family, what&#39;s left?)  If one child &#39;doesn&#39;t want to hear<br/>\n  it&#39;, <br/>\n  maybe say, &quot;I am very sad when you hurt my family and I need to talk<br/>\n  with <br/>\n  you about it.   Hurting your brother makes my heart cry.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>\n  being hurt and I need you to stop.  I don&#39;t know how to stop feeling the<br/>\n<br/>\n  hurt.  Will you help me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do you think some of it is that the middle (and teasing) child is<br/>\n  looking <br/>\n  for more attention from you?  If so, maybe make some dedicated time for <br/>\n  just Mom-and-middle-child, say 10 or 15 minutes solid when NOTHING will <br/>\n  pull you away from talking to him and playing with him, and doing<br/>\n  whatever <br/>\n  he wants to do.  If another child needs you, tell them that you&#39;re with <br/>\n  this child now and you&#39;ll be there in a while.  Ignore the phone. <br/>\n  Etc.  Just you and he, every day, for a certain time (and this goes for <br/>\n  EACH of the children.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for the daughter, I&#39;d have told the 3 year old that he didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n  go <br/>\n  inside, but that his sister was scared about being alone does he<br/>\n  remember <br/>\n  how it feels when he is scared?  Well, he and mommy are going to help<br/>\n  her <br/>\n  be not so scared and if he didn&#39;t want to go inside, then he could stay<br/>\n  in <br/>\n  the car (with the windows cracked) but that you were going inside to<br/>\n  help <br/>\n  sister feel not so scared and would watch him from the window.  Ask him <br/>\n  Does he want to bring a book or a toy for the car?  Then I&#39;d plop myself<br/>\n  in <br/>\n  the front window where I&#39;d be with my daughter and could wave (and make <br/>\n  funny faces) to my son, out in the car.  Maybe make it focus on taking<br/>\n  care <br/>\n  of (and relating to) someone else when they&#39;re feeling badly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Which reminds me, we have a tradition of, &quot;if you cause the pain, you<br/>\n  take <br/>\n  care of it &#39;tll it&#39;s gone.&quot;  If I hurt someone, I need to stay with that<br/>\n<br/>\n  someone until they&#39;re okay again, and take care of them and get them ice<br/>\n  or <br/>\n  hugs or whatever they need to be okay again.  This goes for physical as <br/>\n  well as emotional owies and it gives people a way to stop being the <br/>\n  &#39;meanie&#39; and become the &#39;caring person&#39;.   No Guilt.  No <br/>\n  recriminations.  Just taking care.  You&#39;ve got to help them do it<br/>\n  (sweetly) <br/>\n  the first few times, but later on, they&#39;ll generally move to do it on<br/>\n  their <br/>\n  own.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck.  There&#39;s so much more, but without knowing your kids, I&#39;d be <br/>\n  whistling into the wind more than I am already!<br/>\n  HeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yahoo!
