Nick <br/>\nwas in the public schools and hated it, and a while ago I discovered that a <br/>\nSudbury Valley School was being planned in their area, in New Britain. (For <br/>\nthose who are not familiar with this model, Sudbury Valley Schools are kind <br/>\nof Unschooling schools. The kids have the freedom to learn when and as they <br/>\nwish, with support of staff when they want it. The kids are also hugely <br/>\ninvolved in the actual running of the school. ) They got involved, and Nick <br/>\nhas been attending, deliriously happily, for the past year. Their web site is <br/>\nhere:<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the school is now struggling. They need more students if they are <br/>\ngoing to survive next year. Nick does not want to homeschool, but if the <br/>\nschool closes he&#39;ll probably end up back in the public schools for high <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my questions. First, do you know anyone in the Hartford/New Britain area <br/>\nwho would be interested in a Sudbury Valley School? Second, do you have any <br/>\nideas about how and where they can market? Where do you find parents who <br/>\nmight &quot;get it?&quot; and trust their children?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is inappropriate, please let me know. People are welcome to respond <br/>\nto my e-mail directly. I just think you&#39;ll be a great source of wisdom, since <br/>\nyou already trust your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68107,"nextTopicId":69052}}
