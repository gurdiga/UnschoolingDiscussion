We&#39;re trying to get out of it. She has a mild articulation problem, and an unusual prosody, but I&#39;ve come to realize that neither of these keeps her from communicating effectively with anyone, nor interferes with her forming friendships with people of various ages. So I no longer see her delay or prosody as a problem needing fixing. It&#39;s just the way she is. As it so happens, Sarah is interested in the theater and plans to take classes at the local Junior Theatre next year if we&#39;re still here (or we&#39;ll find one when we move). Having been there, I think she&#39;ll learn more about speaking well and clearly from those activities and through her participation in AWANAs where she&#39;s speaking in front of strangers than sitting in a little room once a week for 45 minutes saying certain sounds over and over. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf it&#39;s not affecting her relationships with others, or keeping her from communicating clearly, I&#39;d just maybe at most work with her at home if it bothers her. <br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck whatever your choice!<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian and Kathy Stamp &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bstamp@...\">bstamp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nNot sure if you have discussed this issue before but I&#39;m curious about speech.

She has a bit of a lisp, and also says �w� instead of �L� a lot<br/>\nof the time. Nothing would induce me to send her speech therapy. I�m<br/>\nconvinced it is a non-problem that she will grow out of and then we will<br/>\nmiss her endearing �I wuv you�. In fact it is clearly better than it was<br/>\neven just a few months ago. Is Grace being asked stupid �quizzing� questions<br/>\nby the adults? Jayn always clams up in that kind of situation. We always<br/>\ntell people she won�t be a performing monkey. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think you may have plenty of time to seek speech therapy if she<br/>\nlets you know she is very unhappy with her own progress. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It&#39;s much improved over just a year ago however and I can sometimes catch her sounding things out on her own, when she thinks no one is listening, trying to get the words right. I&#39;m not worried (most of the time anyway). We&#39;ve all made the effort to understand her and if outsiders find it hard I&#39;m usually there to help out. It just takes some a little longer to work it out. Your child doesn&#39;t have a teacher that needs to understand her or a room of kids who might tease her so why bother now?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
