It is a way of life and the way it should <br/>\nbe, but people.........I don&#39;t know.<br/>\nI only said that because that&#39;s what people nowadays associate with...<br/>\nMe being part native, I am trying to get back to that way of life... My <br/>\nnative ancerstors are calling me and have been for YEARS. Out of fear I <br/>\nrejected them. Because of what certain religions say about things like that I <br/>\nrejected them...... I will not do that anymore and perhaps that is why it is <br/>\na daily battle and struggle for me. To break those chains from around mind!<br/>\nThat way of life is so simple......Just plain simple....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am on a mission to free myself.........free my mind and get out of debt and <br/>\nbecome debt free.<br/>\nFree of society&#39;s materialistic ways and thoughts. Even though I have learn <br/>\nthat lesson a while back.....you slip back now and then.<br/>\nI have now say hey.....why can&#39;t I make my own furniture....... I was tired <br/>\nof constantly buying because stuff just don&#39;t last. Which of course it does <br/>\ncause they want you to spend , spend, spend!<br/>\nI got tired of the chairs from the store breaking over time......so we made a <br/>\nbench that has a back to it and storage. I covered it with fabric and <br/>\ncushions.<br/>\nWe just made another plain bench. The top piece is a 2x12x8 and that piece of <br/>\nwood was only $8.52 and then we cut 2x4&#39;s and turned them into 4x4&#39;s and I <br/>\ncovered the seams with 1x3&#39;s. Then we took what 1x4 and made feet, and <br/>\nrounded the edges.<br/>\nI am going to either back a cushion or cover for that....<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning to simplfy my life....It feels a little better, but I know it <br/>\nwill be alot better debt free.<br/>\nIt feels good not being apart of the rat race and consumerism.......<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40992,"nextTopicId":41198}}
