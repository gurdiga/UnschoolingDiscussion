It took her a <br/>\nyear and a 1/2 and even now still does, (but not like it was in the <br/>\nbeginning). Here a couple links I have found useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.deschooling.org/<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.unschooling.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are alot of great articles and information. Parents who have been/ are <br/>\ngoing through this very thing. Good luck :)<br/>\nIndiana Tami<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world&quot;<br/>\n                                                               ~Ghandi<br/>\nNetworking for Central Indiana unschoolers :)<br/>\nhttp://communities.msn.com/ChildLedLearninginIndiana<br/>\nChildren Leading the Way!<br/>\nhttp://ChildLedLearning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nhttp://ChildEarthBasedLearning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----Original Message Follows----<br/>\nFrom: TarazSpot@...<br/>\nReply-To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nTo: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deschooling links?<br/>\nDate: Wed, 07 Nov 2001 00:30:00 -0000<br/>\n<br/>\n       Hello all! This is our first year unschooling and I was<br/>\nwondering if anyone had some links to some good &quot;deschooling&quot;<br/>\ninformation.  My oldest, who is nine, is going through the<br/>\ndeschooling process and it can be difficult at times to maintain our<br/>\npatience.  We have not reached the motivation point yet by any<br/>\nmeans!! He is currently shunning ALL &quot;learning&quot; activities whatsoever<br/>\nand stays clear of books like the plague. ( by activities I do not<br/>\nmean &quot;workbooks&quot;) My husband is VERY concerned and I am a bit stuck<br/>\nin the middle. My belief is to just &quot;be&quot; and let him explore his<br/>\nfreedom. We are experiencing real life adventures large and small.<br/>\nThe main trouble seems to be that my husbands idea of substance<br/>\nsometimes differs from mine.<br/>\n                     Thanks,<br/>\n                         Tara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"TarazSpot@aol.com","from":"TarazSpot@...","profile":"tarazspot","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"i-02UpKgEMI7uo9JAHQyBuCCzo6DowHKO0A4FudFZwpWwCT0TuNuIx5BOdE-QsY7vOVICiCmb0Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Deschooling links?","postDate":"1005093000","msgId":27460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlzOXZhOCtmb284QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27461,"prevInTime":27459,"nextInTime":27461,"topicId":27460,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all!
