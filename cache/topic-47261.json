Doors to businesses, car doors, doors of houses, any door. Even though we juggle getting 3 kids into car seats, and loading tons of bags when we go to the grocery store, DH still opens and closes the car door for me. When we were in Ohio once, an older man (probably aroung 70) stopped and said he wanted to shake my DH&#39;s hand - said he saw way too many husbands not showing basic respect like that to their wives. I accidentally embarrased the heck out of the Coke delivery guy once when I tried to be nice and hold the door to a c-store open for him to get thru with his loaded dolly. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  In the 1970&#39;s the etiquette of door opening changed here.  The rule at UNM <br/>\n  (the state university in Albuquerque where I went) was whoever gets there <br/>\n  first should open the door, and if anyone&#39;s carrying things someone else <br/>\n  should open the door.  We were trying consciously to remove the &quot;men open <br/>\n  doors for ladies&quot; situation, because some of the &quot;ladies&quot; were trying to be <br/>\n  tacky about it, so in many letters to the university newspaper, that became <br/>\n  the new &quot;rules&quot; for us to try.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There have been a couple of times since then when I have opened the door for <br/>\n  another woman and she walked through all snooty like without saying &quot;thank <br/>\n  you&quot; or anything.  That&#39;s irritating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My kids will open the door for anyone, and if someone else is holding the <br/>\n  door when they go through, even if it&#39;s someone in their own family, they say <br/>\n  &quot;thank you.&quot;  Because that&#39;s the way Keith and I go through doors.

So I <br/>\n  wait to see how they&#39;re doing, and I&#39;ll hang back to let them finish if it <br/>\n  looks like they&#39;ll succeed.  Or I&#39;ll say &quot;Do you want help?&quot; and I&#39;ll help <br/>\n  JUST a little, and then say &quot;That&#39;s a really hard door,&quot; or &quot;This one&#39;s <br/>\n  heavier than some of the other doors.
