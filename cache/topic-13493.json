I was unable to access the<br/>\narticle so I&#39;ll have to go out and buy the paper.  But here are my<br/>\nimmediate thoughts, negative and postive:  <br/>\nDoes the Chicago Public System have the right to judge anybody?  Do they<br/>\nhave the staff to do this ?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 friends that teach in the Chgo. public school system. One is a<br/>\nkindergarten teacher who is consistently amazed at the large number of<br/>\nher students who are not aware of  letters, numbers or books.  These<br/>\nthings are completely foreign to them. They are, however, well versed in<br/>\nswearing and threatening each other.  If this is truly the case, maybe<br/>\nsome counseling would be a good thing. But again, I must ask, the Chicago<br/>\nPS?  What a joke. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">     &gt; INTRUSIVE POLICIES. Chicago public schools will begin this year <br/>\n&gt; evaluating<br/>\n&gt; parents. Yes, you read that correctly. The district will rate <br/>\n&gt; parents on<br/>\n&gt; how well they fulfil 23 &quot;responsibilities.&quot; Schools have the option <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; targeting all parents, or only selected parents. Parents who don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; meet the<br/>\n&gt; expectations of the schools will receive home visits every 10 weeks <br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; one of more than 1000 school staff members or counselors. Some of <br/>\n&gt; the areas<br/>\n&gt; that might put parents on the list:<br/>\n&gt; * Parent fails to praise the child often enough<br/>\n&gt; * Parent spends insufficient &quot;quality time&quot; with child <br/>\n&gt; * Child eats meals or snacks that the school deems unhealthy. <br/>\n&gt; * Child dressed in a manner the school considers inappropriate for <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; weather<br/>\n&gt; * Child is tardy or absent from school<br/>\n&gt; * Child comes to school inadequately unprepared<br/>\n&gt; * Child fails to return completed homework on time<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicago.tribune.com/version1/article/0,1575,SAV-\">http://www.chicago.tribune.com/version1/article/0,1575,SAV-</a><br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -------------------------- eGroups Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13502,"nextTopicId":13446}}
