I heard the bedroom door open quietly.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually at 6:30 everyone&#39;s asleep, so it was unusual. It was Marty (16), and <br/>\nhe said he needed to talk to me about his plans for the day. I asked if he <br/>\nwanted Keith to hear it too, and he said sure, so I stayed on the phone. He said <br/>\n&quot;I want to go with Ryan. He wants to pick me up in half an hour.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI waited. I smiled. I said &quot;Okay, but... where?&quot; I kinda thought by the time <br/>\nand manner of the asking it was an out-of-town trip. No. &quot;To stand in line to <br/>\nbuy an XBox 360.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we discussed money and logistics and such, and it was a go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got up and came to help Marty checklist his day and not forget anything <br/>\nThey&#39;ll be inside a WalMart, so honestly, just about anything he had forgotten <br/>\nwould be there, and I wasn&#39;t too worried. It wasn&#39;t like standing in a line at a <br/>\ncampground 20 miles from running water.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about the other people&#39;s day, and Kirby&#39;s working, but Marty had <br/>\nKirby&#39;s money already--they&#39;re going together on a system with money they&#39;ve <br/>\nboth been saving. (Kirby is 19.) Then Marty said &quot;He&#39;s going to stand in line <br/>\ntoo, but with [some other friends]. We had a big fight about it last night, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t get on him about it because it was my fault.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked him if they had hit each other. No. Were there mortal insults? No.<br/>\nI asked if he wanted to tell me about it, and he said no, that Holly (14) <br/>\ncould tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid, I wouldn&#39;t have trusted any other kid in our family (my <br/>\nsister and two same-age cousins) to tell my side of anything, or to give a <br/>\nneutral account of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly will probably really enjoy telling me, because she&#39;s very interested in <br/>\ninterpersonal stuff of all sorts.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was awake and getting ready for work, I said &quot;Marty says you got <br/>\nin in a fight last night, but that it was stupid, and that it was his fault.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby said, &quot;It WAS stupid, and it WAS his fault.&quot; He didn&#39;t sound angry or <br/>\nfrustrated, just matter-of-fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Are you both going to be okay?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s still asleep, so I don&#39;t know what it was about or how bad it was, <br/>\nbut it wasn&#39;t TOO bad, because they didn&#39;t break their plan to share an XBox, <br/>\nand there wasn&#39;t soul-wounding name calling or physical violence.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s a bad day at our house.

I told her that if there <br/>\nwas no hitting or name calling, it wasn&#39;t really much of a fight.   She agreed <br/>\nit was just an emotional discussion.   I asked her if either of them said <br/>\nanything mean, and she thought about it, and came up with the meanest thing having <br/>\nbeen Marty to Kirby, saying something like &quot;I don&#39;t know your friends and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust their plans.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe laughed.   He didn&#39;t even say &quot;I don&#39;t know your stupid friends and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust their stupid plans.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said he told Kirby that he knew Ryan better, and would rather stand in <br/>\nline with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it turned out, they didn&#39;t let kids substitute for others in line anyway, <br/>\nso the whole original plan WAS an unworkable plan.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone of those two groups who wanted the system got one, but the world is <br/>\nwoefully undersupplied for that system and they scalpers are out selling them <br/>\nfor twice their price.
