I have visited unschooling.com numerous times<br/>\nand I just signed on to the loop. Here&#39;s a brief backgound....<br/>\n   Although I have been reading John Holt for years this is my first<br/>\nstep to unschool my children. We have three kids, Zach (9), Drew (6),<br/>\nand Chloe (who has always been unschooled...4 yrs.) Well, the boys<br/>\nwere excited to be &quot;homeschooled&quot; this year and Thursday August 30th<br/>\nwas spent at a park day for all the homeschoolers/unschoolers in our<br/>\narea. A few days have passed now and my oldest faces me today and<br/>\nloudly announces that I have not taught him A THING and how is he<br/>\nsupposed to learn!!!?? So, I say quite calmly, well what would you<br/>\nlike to learn?? He gets quite angry at my reponse and replies, &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know! You are just supposed to be teaching me something! I<br/>\ncan&#39;t just watch T.V. all day!&quot; LOL I laugh because my oldest is my<br/>\nmost television addicted child. I respond, &quot;anything you want to do<br/>\nis fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; He walked<br/>\naway in a huff.  A short time later he did bring out a game and we<br/>\nall played. I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack<br/>\nof &quot;formal lessons&quot; and after the game was finished I brought out his<br/>\nmath book from the last school year. I showed him the book and<br/>\nexplained to him that the work inside was extremely easy (it is far<br/>\nbelow his abilities) and he agreed. I then showed him that out of an<br/>\nentire year the book had not even been halfway completed. I pointed<br/>\nout that I felt if he wanted to do it he could sit and complete the<br/>\nentire book in a day or two. He wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the teacher<br/>\nor for kids who did not understand, etc..  He kind of laughed in<br/>\nagreement with me. He did not, and I did not expect him to, work in<br/>\nthe book but helped put the game away and went back to the T.V.<br/>\n    I can tell he does not grasp what I am explaining fully.

We don&#39;t have access to great public educational channels, and the schedule for the cable channels is hard to figure out here.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreviously, in another location, we watched the WAM! channel lots.

In the meantime, you can say &quot;read anything you want, but read&quot; or something like that.  My children go through spurts where they really love doing workbooks / worksheets...and then they&#39;ll not look at them again for weeks.  Sometimes they&#39;ll get all caught up in playing their instruments (ukulele, recorder, etc.) and decide to work on either learning new songs or getting better at old ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to homeschool PE and field trips.  But mostly, I sincerely try to answer their questions, and I&#39;ve shown them how to look things up in the encyclopedias.  They are getting much better at finding out the answers they want to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it gets really bad, you can &quot;accidentally&quot; lose the remote (since no kid nowadays understands how to use a TV without one!) or unplug the TV until something else is done to your satisfaction.

Here&#39;s a brief backgound....<br/>\n   Although I have been reading John Holt for years this is my first <br/>\nstep to unschool my children. We have three kids, Zach (9), Drew (6), <br/>\nand Chloe (who has always been unschooled...4 yrs.) Well, the boys <br/>\nwere excited to be &quot;homeschooled&quot; this year and Thursday August 30th <br/>\nwas spent at a park day for all the homeschoolers/unschoolers in our <br/>\narea. A few days have passed now and my oldest faces me today and <br/>\nloudly announces that I have not taught him A THING and how is he <br/>\nsupposed to learn!!!?? So, I say quite calmly, well what would you <br/>\nlike to learn?? He gets quite angry at my reponse and replies, &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know! You are just supposed to be teaching me something! I <br/>\ncan&#39;t just watch T.V. all day!&quot; LOL I laugh because my oldest is my <br/>\nmost television addicted child. I respond, &quot;anything you want to do <br/>\nis fine with me...math, science, play a game, anything.&quot; He walked <br/>\naway in a huff.  A short time later he did bring out a game and we <br/>\nall played. I could tell he was still very bothered by my lack <br/>\nof &quot;formal lessons&quot; and after the game was finished I brought out his <br/>\nmath book from the last school year. I showed him the book and <br/>\nexplained to him that the work inside was extremely easy (it is far <br/>\nbelow his abilities) and he agreed. I then showed him that out of an <br/>\nentire year the book had not even been halfway completed. I pointed <br/>\nout that I felt if he wanted to do it he could sit and complete the <br/>\nentire book in a day or two. He wouldn&#39;t have to wait for the teacher <br/>\nor for kids who did not understand, etc..  He kind of laughed in <br/>\nagreement with me. He did not, and I did not expect him to, work in <br/>\nthe book but helped put the game away and went back to the T.V. <br/>\n    I can tell he does not grasp what I am explaining fully. He still <br/>\ndoes not understand why I am not sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; him. <br/>\nIs &quot;unschooling&quot; a philosphy that I should sit and explain to him in <br/>\ndetail?  I have made numerous points to him but never totally and <br/>\ncompletely explained. The funny thing is I expected him to be <br/>\nthrilled by the fact that he was not going to be made to &quot;work&quot; and <br/>\ninstead his reaction caught me totally offguard!!
