She or he (not sure if it&#39;s possible to tell - anyone else<br/>\nknow?) had attached to the top of the screen.  Pretty cool.  The other<br/>\ncaterpillar &quot;ran&quot; around the bug barn for a couple of hours before that<br/>\none (Princess Leana don&#39;t you know) began her(?) cocoon as well.  We<br/>\nfound out that it takes 3 weeks before they turn into moths.  We also<br/>\nfound out how they do it, which is gross and cool at the same time.<br/>\nKind of like how a group of cells knows how to form into a liver or a<br/>\nheart, same thing.  The cells are inside the caterpillar which is just a<br/>\nshell.  It basically turns into a ball of mush as the cells start to<br/>\nclump together and reform themselves.  Too cool.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, you might consider this kind of box so your child can put a bug<br/>\nin it and safely observe it.  My dd2 managed to &quot;pet&quot; hers to death.

Like 6 different sets of domino <br/>\nrally.  Micro machine cars and sets.   Quite frankly, our house is <br/>\nalways a mess &#39;cause this stuff is always out!  But they would lose <br/>\nso much creativity and fun and learning if they didn&#39;t have access to <br/>\ntheir stuff all the time.  My boys are 6 and 4 and have always had <br/>\naccess to all the craft stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen stores have back to school sales, crayola markers usually go on <br/>\nsale for under a dollar.  You can stock up on a lot of markers at <br/>\nthat price, and then if a marker gets dried out, you&#39;ve got another <br/>\nto replace it.  Also, a tip we learned at the crayola factory is that <br/>\nyou can revive a marker one time by soaking it in warm water for a <br/>\nlittle while.  I think 30 seconds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never had much of a problem with broken crayons, even when <br/>\nthey&#39;re left out.  And we bought the crayola crayon maker, which is a <br/>\nLOT of fun.  We collect crayons that do get broken and make new <br/>\ncrayons out of them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do ask them to play with the play doh in the kitchen and <br/>\ndiningroom, which are the non-carpeted rooms, and I always make sure <br/>\nI sweep the floors really well when they&#39;re done playing because I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want play doh to get ground into the carpet.  But if it ever <br/>\nwould get ground into the carpet...I&#39;d rather them have constant <br/>\naccess to play doh than have great carpet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce Matt drew a picture on the wall with a crayola marker.

They&#39;re great at getting a lot of <br/>\nstuff clean, like those little grooves in the refrigerator.  They do <br/>\ntake stain off though, so I don&#39;t recommend using them on things that <br/>\nhave a stained finish.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Legislative Monitor&quot; <br/>\n&lt;LegWatch@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem wasn&#39;t the walls being my major concern.

I&#39;m just jaw-dropping amazed at that! I bet mixing play-doh colors was<br/>\na problem too. I never understand people who don&#39;t let kids mix the play-doh<br/>\ncolors. *shaking my head sadly*<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 6, 5 and recently 4. Of course the crayons get broken and the<br/>\ncaps get left off the markers. I gently remind them that the markers dry out<br/>\nand aren&#39;t useful anymore when I throw them away, but we get new ones<br/>\nperiodically. Crayons cost all of $3 to replace, maybe $5 for the really big<br/>\nset, I don&#39;t remember. And it&#39;s always so much fun to get a new set!<br/>\nPlay-doh, I pick up on sale for $1 a 4 pack, and there&#39;s nothing like soft,<br/>\nnew play-doh. I can&#39;t imagine getting upset because the crayons are getting<br/>\nbroken!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also buy quality art supplies, which are just as accessible as the<br/>\ncrayola stuff. We have a great art supply store in Georgetown that I just<br/>\n*love* to walk through. We have oil pastels, chalk pastels, 24 color<br/>\nwatercolor set, sculpey clay, tempera paints, origami paper, tissue paper,<br/>\netc. I have asked them to be a bit more careful with the watercolors by<br/>\nwiping their brush on a paper towel to keep the colors true, but that&#39;s<br/>\nmostly because I was painting with them too. They have several other<br/>\nwatercolor sets when they want to mix the colors together. We also had fun<br/>\nfiguring out how to mix the colors purposely on the plastic lid.<br/>\n<br/>\nScissors, too, are stored right along with the art supplies and have been<br/>\nfor at least 2 years here, probably more. There have been a couple of times<br/>\nwhen my youngest lost privileges for a little while until he was ready to<br/>\ntry again (which he determined, not me)--like the time he cut his sister&#39;s<br/>\nhair or his shirt. We just talked about things that were appropriate for<br/>\ncutting and I told him to let me know when he was ready to try again. Those<br/>\nare the only scissor incidents I can think of. We also had a brief period a<br/>\ncouple of years ago when the crayons got put up for a little while only to<br/>\nbe brought down when I was nearby because he drew on the walls, the<br/>\nfurniture, the carpet, the washing machine, the keyboard and the computer<br/>\nmonitor--not all at once but in a series of attacks. *g* He helped me clean<br/>\nup the slippery and easy to wipe surfaces. The keyboard never came clean; we<br/>\njust eventually inherited a new one. And the monitor forever had wax<br/>\nremnants in a ghost pattern of the original artwork. But he soon got over<br/>\nthat as well. (They used to have an art table in the laundry room just off<br/>\nthe family room before I moved everything upstairs to the kitchen where they<br/>\nhad far more room to spread out, which may have had something to do with it,<br/>\ntoo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think this is part of having kids, you know? Gosh, kids need to be<br/>\nkids. They need room to explore and test their boundaries, and they need a<br/>\ngentle, loving adult to help them understand what kinds of things work and<br/>\nwhat don&#39;t, which includes replacing broken crayons and dried out markers,<br/>\ncleaning up lots of messes and encouraging them to explore in as many<br/>\nappropriate ways as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":162967824,"authorName":"Dawn Adams","from":"&quot;Dawn Adams&quot; &lt;Wishbone@...&gt;","profile":"bluenosegoddess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] wallpaper peelers","postDate":"1085486259","msgId":94669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDMwMWM0NDI2YyQ0NDRmZDQwMCQ2NzRjZGUxOEBhb2xkc2wubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PE5LRUlKSEVMTVBCQ1BFUE5CR0pER0VKS0dEQUEubGVnd2F0Y2hAcmVsaWFibGVhbnN3ZXJzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":94667,"nextInTopic":94676,"prevInTime":94668,"nextInTime":94670,"topicId":94631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Annette writes: The problem wasn t the walls being my major concern.

He can dip the markers in the water and get some more use out of them. Once they&#39;re really and truly done then he can take them apart and see how they&#39;re made. Broken crayons still colour. they can be melted into new rainbow coloured, chunky crayons or shaved with a knife. the shavings can be put between two pieces of wax paper, a cloth over that and then apply a hot iron to melt the shaving. You&#39;re left with a beutiful suncatcher. <br/>\n  Buy cheap markers and crayons for when they&#39;re young and want to experiment. My daughter is about to turn 6 and we&#39;re just getting into purchasing really good quality supplies but until now i bought those supplies understanding they would dry out or get broken.

And half the time it&#39;s been my big sewing scissors when we couldn&#39;t find her little ones. I&#39;m not sure what to think of privlidges. To me they sound like something you dangle over a kids head for good behaviour, too much like rewards. I can&#39;t fit privledges into the context of my life right now. My daughter has scissors privlidges I guess but simply because she went and used them, not because I deemed she was ready. My two year old has outlet privledges but simply because he went and learned how to plug stuff in not because I deemed him mature enough. I suppose the difference may be that I watch my kids take on new responsibilities and &#39;priviledges&#39; as they themselves decide they&#39;re ready and able and you prefer to issue them as you see them conform to your idea of maturity? That sounds snarky I know and apologize but I can&#39;t think of another way to phrase it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dawn (of NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":79857534,"authorName":"Legislative Monitor","from":"&quot;Legislative Monitor&quot; &lt;LegWatch@...&gt;","profile":"annettemhall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] wallpaper peelers","postDate":"1085443650","msgId":94660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5LRUlKSEVMTVBCQ1BFUE5CR0pER0VKS0dEQUEubGVnd2F0Y2hAcmVsaWFibGVhbnN3ZXJzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNTI0LjEzMjYyOC4yMjc5My42ODk2NUB3ZWJtYWlsMjMubnljLnVudGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":94631,"nextInTopic":94661,"prevInTime":94659,"nextInTime":94661,"topicId":94631,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The problem wasn t the walls being my major concern.
