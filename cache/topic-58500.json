All the presenters are unschoolers you&#39;ve either &quot;met&quot; here or <br/>\non the unschooling.com message boards. You will find no better panel of <br/>\nUNschoolers anywhere!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n And if an hour of a conference is spent answering <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; things like &quot;what about socialization&quot; and &quot;how can they learn to read <br/>\n&gt; without phonics&quot; then those who paid money aren&#39;t getting much good <br/>\n&gt; information, and those asking those questions could have them answered by <br/>\n&gt; just looking around at the kids and by reading any beginning unschooling <br/>\n&gt; article, or picking up two or three homeschooling magazines until they find <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; an article on reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And most of the attendees are ALREADY hard-core unschoolers or are &quot;almost <br/>\nthere&quot; wannabees. It&#39;s very exciting to have THAT many folks who &quot;get it&quot; in <br/>\none building. There&#39;s NO discussion of &quot;socialization&quot; (I can&#39;t remember <br/>\nany)---it&#39;s obvious if you just look around. Reading and math are usual <br/>\nconcerns with newbies, so those subjects DO come up. The philosophy of <br/>\nunschooling seemed to be a popular &quot;subject&quot; last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t love panel discussions much either, because too often it granulates <br/>\n&gt; the information down into little reactionary bits and there&#39;s  not enough <br/>\n&gt; cohesion to get a good point.  There was an unschooling panel at last <br/>\n&gt; year&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; HSC conference.  There were some good moments, but overall it seemed very <br/>\n&gt; disjoint to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>AH! But if the panel members are all on the same wavelength---what a cool way <br/>\nto get your questions answered! A panel set up at the end *shouldn&#39;t* have to <br/>\nanswer a lot of those exhaustive questions &#39;cause many should have been <br/>\nanswered throughout the weekend (I would think). <br/>\n<br/>\nPanel discussion this year?
