The old <br/>\nhome-ed-press URL is currently linked to a pornographic website <br/>\nadministrated by a company in Armenia.<br/>\n<br/>\nWARNING - Please DON&#39;T check out that old home-ed-press site out of <br/>\nidle curiosity, because it is a &quot;virulent&quot;* porn site that will keep <br/>\nopening multiple windows until your browser or your whole machine <br/>\ncrashes. If you&#39;re really *that* curious to see what&#39;s there, please <br/>\nsave everything before clicking the link. *virulent - highly <br/>\ninfective, rapidly spreading, deadly<br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is on our website at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.</a> We will post any updates <br/>\nand additional information on that page.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little history: We created the home-ed-press.com domain name when <br/>\nwe were publishing books on homeschooling several years ago. We sold <br/>\nthe book publishing part of our company when we decided to focus on <br/>\nthe magazine, but we kept the home-ed-press.com URL mirrored to our <br/>\nhome-ed-magazine.com site because so many homeschooling websites <br/>\nshowed to the old URL &lt;home-ed-press.com&gt; as their link to Home <br/>\nEducation Magazine&#39;s many features and free services.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut somehow the registration on the home-ed-press.com domain name <br/>\nexpired (we&#39;re still trying to figure out how it expired without our <br/>\nknowledge), and it was bought by a wholesale company, which leased or <br/>\nrented it just last week to an overseas company which linked it to a <br/>\nporn site, obviously to capitalize on the high number of links.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are, with a big mess on our hands: A widely linked <br/>\nhomeschooling URL linked to a gnarly pornography site. We are working <br/>\nto straighen out the mess, but we need help. All the help we can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE - If you have a link to the old home-ed-press domain name on <br/>\nyour website please change it to home-ed-magazine.com as soon as <br/>\npossible. Please check the sites for your local homeschooling support <br/>\ngroup, your local public library, your favorite online resources - <br/>\nanyplace that might have a link to Home Education Magazine&#39;s hundreds <br/>\nof pages via the old home-ed-press.com URL.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebmasters: We offer the following advice from Ann Zeise, who first <br/>\nnotified us of this problem:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how to find out if you have any home-ed-press links on your <br/>\nsite. Go to the search engine at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.altavista.com\">http://www.altavista.com</a> In the <br/>\nsearch field put the following parameters (exchanging my <br/>\nwww.gomilpitas.com URL for your own root directory in the last part):<br/>\n<br/>\n+link:www.home-ed-press.com -url:www.home-ed-press.com+url:www.gomilpitas.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your site shows up at all on Altavista, you will be able to see if <br/>\nany pages have the errant URL on them. Then just go into your copy of <br/>\nthese pages and do a &quot;&quot;FIND and REPLACE&quot; and replace <br/>\n&quot;www.home-ed-press.com&quot; with &quot;www.home-ed-magazine.com&quot; -- They kept <br/>\nall the rest of the directories and paths the same, so your link will <br/>\nnow go to its original destination. (Do check in case you just happen <br/>\nto have a link to a page they have removed for some reason. All of <br/>\nmine were corrected this way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTE: using the first two parameters in this sort of search is a good <br/>\nway to find out who is linking to you. Just put in your own URL after <br/>\n&quot;+link:&quot; and &quot;-url:&quot;.\t-Ann Zeise<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this notice to homeschooling and alternative education <br/>\nemail lists, online newsletter editors, support group lists, <br/>\neducational reference lists - anyplace Home Education Magazine&#39;s <br/>\naward-winning website might be linked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis message is on our website at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/badurl.html.</a> We will post any updates <br/>\nand additional information on that page.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for whatever you can do to help!<br/>\n<br/>\nMark and Helen Hegener, Publishers<br/>\nHome Education Magazine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM@...\">HEM@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20628,"nextTopicId":20723}}
