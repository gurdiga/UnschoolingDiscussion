Buying video games or clothes or toys<br/>\nor books or going out for food or whatever. That&#39;s one thing we just don&#39;t<br/>\ndo very much of. I can&#39;t remember the last time I was in a Target or<br/>\nWalmart - maybe 6 months ago? I don&#39;t buy books in Borders or Barnes and<br/>\nNoble anymore, I get them at the library or borrow them from friends. Our<br/>\nclothes are hand-me-downs or thrift stores, and going out to eat (even fast<br/>\nfood) happens less than once a month. For us, at least, such is the price of<br/>\nliving here where we have a great support group of like-minded<br/>\nhomeschoolers, lots of really, really cool kids for our kids to hang out<br/>\nwith, and plenty of good adult friends for us. Even setting aside<br/>\nenvironmental goals of reducing consumerism, this trade-off has been a very<br/>\npositive one.<br/>\nBut to get back to your original question, I do think it&#39;s natural to drift<br/>\naway from people we have less and less in common with. I do still keep in<br/>\ntouch with my childless friends, but we don&#39;t hang out much together<br/>\nanymore. I can&#39;t leave everything at the drop of a hat to go off and do<br/>\nsomething for a weekend and they can. It changes everything. Likewise, I<br/>\nhave drifted away from friends who do have kids but whose parenting ideals<br/>\nare much different from my own. That includes friends whose kids are going<br/>\nto school. My kids feel the same way as well. My son rarely asks to play<br/>\nwith the neighborhood friends that he was once so close to. Once they<br/>\nstarted in to school, *they* changed. They no longer play the same way, they<br/>\ntease more, fight more, and have different attitudes towards life that<br/>\nperplex him. One mom friend in particular really wants to still get our kids<br/>\ntogether often. The boys used to be the best of friends. It&#39;s getting to the<br/>\npoint now where I&#39;m going to have to tell her that my son just doesn&#39;t want<br/>\nto play with hers anymore. I know she will be hurt by this. Sometimes around<br/>\nthe other neighborhood moms they will talk about all the problems they&#39;re<br/>\nhaving in school and then look over at me and say something like &quot;I bet<br/>\nyou&#39;re listening to this and thinking you&#39;re glad that you homeschool,<br/>\nright?&quot; I just smile and nod, they&#39;ve said it all for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Feeling alienated from non-homeschool moms","postDate":"1052745548","msgId":68661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkZC45N2ExZWUyLjJiZjBmOTRjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68651,"nextInTopic":68664,"prevInTime":68660,"nextInTime":68662,"topicId":68563,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I too have been in this situation EXCEPT I was the president of the PTA and was Unschooling family.

This is what&#39;s going on with my bg and I.  As time goes by and she <br/>\nsees the effects of unschooling on my children...and myself!...she talks <br/>\nmore and more about homeschooling and learning more about unschooling.  She <br/>\ngrills and drills me, which I find wonderful, but somehow, it always comes <br/>\nback to how much she LOVES having the kids in school so she has her own <br/>\ntime.  The big thing for her right now is her youngest will start full time <br/>\npreK and the middle child will start Kindy next year.  She can&#39;t wait!  <br/>\nMakes me want to lose my lunch every time she says that.  Her kids are <br/>\ncompletely out of control.  In the past 6 months or so, every time I talk to <br/>\nher she is laying on the couch, not knowing what the kids are doing.  When <br/>\nwe are on the phone, she spends nearly the entire time whining at her kids.  <br/>\nBegging them to stay out of this, quit doing that.  Screaming their names <br/>\nover and over and over, yet never once getting up to handle the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fluctuate between wanting desperately to help her and feeling guilty <br/>\nbecause I am truly not getting much out of the friendship anymore.

I&#39;m <br/>\nfrustrated and tired of listening to her *want* to homeschool, *want* to <br/>\nstop screaming at them all the time, *want* to quit being so lazy,  all the <br/>\nwhile she does nothing to change where she is and tells me how much she is <br/>\ndreading summer vacation because by day two she will be sick of her kids.  <br/>\nUgh!

I feel like if I talk about my choice, <br/>\nthen maybe others will feel like I am *pushing* them.  But it is a <br/>\ndouble edged sword because the reality is that we are keeping our <br/>\nchildren at home and they are not.  Anytime we explain why, they must <br/>\nconfront their own decisions and yet *I* feel obligated to defend my <br/>\nown or at least express them.  So it always leaves these <br/>\nuncomfortable pauses.  Of course, I think those that respect the <br/>\nchoice because they KNOW they would never do it are more comfortable <br/>\nthan those who feel maybe they should be looking into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe further we move from the mainstream, the more difficult it is to <br/>\nwatch those around you who seem to be walking around blindfolded.  <br/>\nThe harder it is to have friends you just do not respect in some <br/>\ncases.  So quality versus quantity in my case, and I feel the same <br/>\nfor my children.  IT is not about looking down on others, but more <br/>\nabout feeling they are not being honest with themselves and are <br/>\nunwilling to take a deeper look at issues.  How easy is it to respect <br/>\nsomeone who will not think out of the box.  My best friend from high <br/>\nschool was suprised when I did not give my son all the required <br/>\nvaccinations, she said she &quot;didn&#39;t know you could do that&quot;.  All I <br/>\ncould think was, &quot;you never asked.&quot;  So certainly the more our <br/>\nchoices take us away from the mainstream, the more our choices for <br/>\nreally great friendships narrow.  Of course, this is just my <br/>\nexperience and I am sure there are others who feel differently.  <br/>\nAlso, as my dh always says, you just have less patience for bullsh*t <br/>\nthe older you get!

I have relatives that parent and school in very different ways and they are not ways I can smile and say its okay to.I have ended up having limited visits with these people and we now don&#39;t have those discussions. The parenting differences are the hardest for me to &quot;ignore&quot; for the sake of family relations. I accept their choices but I sure don&#39;t like them or think they are okay for the children involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are experiencing something similar around competition right now. My son has joined soccer as it is a passion with him for the last three years. He has low thyroid which is now being treated and for the first time he has energy to last an entire game on the field and still be able to run some. I explained to his coach that K might need breaks until his muscles catch up to his new energy. Later in the game he made some remark to him on the field about how much he was resting out there.The parents sitting around tittered. It was made in such a way that my husband was not to sure it was a dig or not The whole competition and sports mentality is in conflict with our parenting, learning, and lifestyle beliefs and our son still wants to play but we despise the field energy etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nMakes it tough to be supportive and also to find support in our community. <br/>\n<br/>\nYikes! I feel like such a radical. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaureen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: jmcseals SEALS <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, May 11, 2003 5:40 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Feeling alienated from non-homeschool moms<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;I guess I feel so strongly that unschooling is truly the best fit for<br/>\n  ALL children, but in the meantime I recognize that not all parents<br/>\n  can comprehend it, much less live it, because it is so radically<br/>\n  different than the way most of us were raised.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m having a big conflict with this myself.

Friends who couldn&#39;t understand my desire to curb my daily social <br/>\n  life for my marriage.  I now find myself separating from friends who follow <br/>\n  very mainstream parenting practices.  These weren&#39;t overnight losses.  Many <br/>\n  of them took years to disolve but the change in lifestyles crept in and ate <br/>\n  away at the friendships.

It&#39;s easy to ignore political differences or even <br/>\n  deep personal beliefs, take religious beliefs for example.

It is even <br/>\n  separating the Christians from one another.  I feel like I&#39;m my own little <br/>\n  island.

It&#39;s like a division we shouldn&#39;t have, a war zone <br/>\nwith WOHM vs SAHM and it&#39;s not personal, it&#39;s just there.  And we can <br/>\ntry to ignore it, but it&#39;s not going away.  WOHMs are afraid that <br/>\nwe&#39;re judging them for not &quot;raising their own children&quot; (and admit <br/>\nit, many of us are).  SAHMs are afraid that they&#39;re judging us <br/>\nfor &quot;letting feminism down&quot; or even &quot;being lazy and wanting someone <br/>\nelse to support us&quot;.  And admittedly, some of them are.  It&#39;s an ugly <br/>\nthing between women, but the fact is that there are nasty judgments <br/>\non both sides and individual women are caught in it just by the <br/>\ndecisions we make in our own homes, which are personal decisions and <br/>\nnot usually intended as political statements.

Make some of <br/>\nthem field workers and others house servants (divided by the shade of <br/>\ntheir skin) and they&#39;ll be so busy fighting over who&#39;s superior and <br/>\njudging each other by every little shade of color difference that <br/>\nthey won&#39;t have time or inclination to revolt.
