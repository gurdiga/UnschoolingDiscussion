One broke.  His tricks weren&#39;t as good one-handed.   He tried glueing <br/>\nit.   He doesn&#39;t &quot;play with them,&quot; he just does the tricks, or wears them <br/>\nwith his duster for fun while they play western-theme role playing or card <br/>\ngames.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for Christmas I got him TWO sets of guns, matching, so when one breaks he <br/>\nstill has a pair and when a second one breaks he STILL has a pair.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt thirteen-nearly-fourteen, if he had grown up in the house I grew up in, he <br/>\nwould have a real gun by now, and been hunting.   If he really had an <br/>\ninterest, he could be going target shooting now with friends of ours who go.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s never even asked to see the one rifle we do own, which we inherited from <br/>\na buckskinner friend of ours who hunted and trapped in Colorado and Alaska, <br/>\nand died on an icy night.   His name was Marty.  That&#39;s why Marty&#39;s named <br/>\nMarty.   Still, our Marty at an age to use real guns has no interest, and <br/>\nwill not be happily amused to get toy guns for Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty and Kirby have been paintballing once.  They had a blast, but it&#39;s <br/>\nexpensive, and they  just haven&#39;t made it back.  Their dad took them. It was <br/>\na work-organized outing for families (mostly or exclusively dads and sons, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s okay with me).
