Here&#39;s an<br/>\nexcerpt from her <br/>\nlatest response on Parade&#39;s website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids<br/>\nare doing and <br/>\ntheir high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed<br/>\nmy concern <br/>\nthat a large percentage of the kids would never use<br/>\ntheir educations <br/>\nif they became home-schoolers themselves. Gifted<br/>\nviolinists would <br/>\nnever be heard in a concert hall; great leaders would<br/>\nnever be able <br/>\nto change society; brilliant scientists would never<br/>\nhave a shot at <br/>\ncuring cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to<br/>\nhome-school your <br/>\nsons and then watch them become home-schooling parents<br/>\nthemselves <br/>\ninstead of having careers? This is a serious<br/>\nphilosophical issue: If <br/>\nyou stay at home and teach your child rocket science,<br/>\nand he stays at <br/>\nhome and teaches his child rocket science, and he<br/>\nstays at home and <br/>\nteaches his child rocket science, when does anyone<br/>\never become a <br/>\nrocket scientist? In short, home-schooling is easy to<br/>\nrecommend for <br/>\ncertain individuals, but hard to recommend for<br/>\nsociety...&quot; (e-mail: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marilyn@...\">marilyn@...</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres my responce to her question : Let me know what<br/>\nyou guys think ..<br/>\nMarilyn,<br/>\nThis is in responce to your homeschool  questions ...<br/>\nI have been homeschooling for 2 years now and I love<br/>\nit ... Someone once asked me what hopes i had for my<br/>\ndaughter when  she grows up ...I hope for her to find<br/>\nand have faith in God ,to have a wonderful husband<br/>\n,and a happy long life ,Then the question came about<br/>\nher career ,Or to homeschool her kids.  I hope that<br/>\nshe does homeschool her children !!! I hope that i<br/>\nhave installed  in her that children are the most<br/>\nimportant part of our lives ..That  a child  is a gift<br/>\nfrom God and that it is our job to raise that child<br/>\nand to take care of them  to teach them about God <br/>\n...Not to push them off one someone else to raise ,or<br/>\nsend them off for some one to teach them that man came<br/>\nfrom apes....It is our  &quot;career &quot;to raise our<br/>\nchildren. It is more rewarding then any paying JOB <br/>\nthere is out there ...As far as my daughter  using her<br/>\ngifts or being a leader. We as homeschool parents do<br/>\nall that. We teach our children what we know, we share<br/>\nour gifts with them, we lead them in the direction<br/>\nthey want to go. We do not force them to think one way<br/>\nor another. They are free to think on their own, not<br/>\nwhat someone else tells them that it is the way to<br/>\nthink. That someone elses ideas are better then<br/>\ntheirs.. We look and learn at all angles, not just one<br/>\nsided  views . To answer your question,  I would be<br/>\nvery proud if my daughter or sons grows up to<br/>\nhomeschool their children .<br/>\nThank you ,<br/>\nWanda  In SC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
