So - here goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a Christian.  I fell in love with God as a small child and relied on<br/>\nHim through a *very* difficult childhood. When I was about 12 I responded to<br/>\nthe teaching of the gospel ( the receive-<br/>\nChrists-forgivness-of-my-sins-and-commit-to-following-Him variety) at a<br/>\nlocal church.  In the years that followed  I left the religion of my family<br/>\n(they weren&#39;t that religious anyway) and have always attended churches where<br/>\nI sensed the Holy Spirit, I read the Bible, prayed, and tried to live in a<br/>\nway that would honor God. My husband and I are very involved in our church<br/>\n(presently a Friends church) I love Jesus.  I feel I owe HIm everything and<br/>\nI know He loves not only me but every person I run across.  This belief<br/>\ninforms almost every aspect of my life.  As you might imagine, It is an<br/>\nintricate and sometimes difficult path.  I expect to spend a lifetime<br/>\nlearning how to love others as Christ loves them and in case you smell an<br/>\naggrandized complex of some sort - yes I know my attempts are baby steps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK now you know more about me than I know about you so here&#39;s the punch<br/>\nline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am an unabashed unschooler.  No really.  I have no conflict about this<br/>\nbecause I want my children to discover their own reliance on Jesus for their<br/>\nlives and not just do as they&#39;re told.  I believe a faith that is based on<br/>\ndoing what your parents make you do is no faith at all. ( As I write this<br/>\ntheir choices are playing Super smash bros. melee on the game cube and<br/>\nwatching episodes of the Simpsons on DVD).  But they also often choose to<br/>\nhear Bible stories, pray, and sing praise songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I share my beliefs with them?  Of course.  My dh and I pray with and for<br/>\neach of them, we teach them the precepts of our beliefs and scriptures that<br/>\nwe feel will help them in their lives.  We also make sure they know about<br/>\nother religions and ideas.  They have friends who&#39;s families are Catholic<br/>\nand Protestant, Orthodox, Mormon, Muslim, Ba&#39;hai, Pagan and in the words of<br/>\none sweet child we know &quot;all mixed up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the claims in the article, I couldn&#39;t disagree more.  It smells like<br/>\nmanipulation to me and not like the loving Spirit led instruction I would<br/>\nexpect from my own church.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I would not say so much about my faith in this forum bc I know<br/>\nthat&#39;s not what you read this list for.  I just wanted you to understand<br/>\nthat unschooling is not unchristian though the lifestyle in a Christian home<br/>\nis going to look different than that in a muslim, or pagan or whatever. Our<br/>\nlifestyle  may look a bit different from yours but the underlying messages I<br/>\nfind in Holt and with other unschoolers are very much in line with the love<br/>\nfor people, including children, and respect for his creation (including you)<br/>\nthatI am called to uphold as a follower of Jesus Christ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be happy to entertain comments about unschooling here.  If you have<br/>\nreligious questions or comments for me better give them to me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and respect,<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81372,"nextTopicId":81880}}
