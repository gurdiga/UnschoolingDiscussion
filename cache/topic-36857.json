I think I originally found this by typing in Chemistry in my search bar.<br/>\n  This is, BTW, designed exclusively for homeschoolers.  It is really great the way it is set up. It was created by a Dr. Jamie Love and he says that a child of 14 can easily master this course.   My ds started it at 12.  He has never finished it but still goes back to it and enjoys it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The email address as I have it is  (without the spaces) <br/>\n  merlin @ synapses .co. uk.  <br/>\n  The Astronomy program is absloutely wonderful!  It has sky maps sites and all sorts of great web sites that it includes in the study. If you have a child that&#39;s turned on by this subject this program&#39;s a MUST!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Betty<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

When your child finishes this (at his/her own pace) they will have equivalent to 1st year college chemistry.  It&#39;s really good.  We got it a couple of years ago and then lost it (it&#39;s a hypertextbook) because of computer problems so I emailed Merlin and we downloaded it again.  He also sent us Astronomy as a sort of bonus the second time because he no longer offered the test that went along with the Alchemy program which we had originally bought.  I think the Alchemy is $40. for the entire program.  (The Astronomy is also really good! though I don&#39;t know the cost of it.)This is all on the computer so if they like science and using the computer then they will probably love this. <br/>\nI&#39;m not preaching textbooks and structured learning here.  Just making it available to them to use as they would like.<br/>\nAre any of you familiar with this program?<br/>\n<br/>\nBetty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Math & Chemistry","postDate":"1020865273","msgId":36866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFiYjl0cCtobWlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWMwMWMxZjY5ZCRkNjQ2MTRlMCQxZTlhZDU0M0BqMXUxdTI+"},"prevInTopic":36859,"nextInTopic":36872,"prevInTime":36865,"nextInTime":36867,"topicId":36857,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Could you e-mail the address again but break it apart so Yahoo doesn t lop it off.
