Gag!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of my <br/>\nchildren, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>\nthat.

All she would give me was an offer for a sympathetic ear, a <br/>\ncup of tea and a sandwich. So much for her reputation as a hard-ass. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; (Hi Sandra) I just figure if you ask for a slap, I&#39;ll give you a <br/>\nslap. But only the cyber/silly version.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you&#39;re feeling better. FWIW I was thinking more about what you <br/>\nwrote. I know that I&#39;ve had those feelings creep up from time to time <br/>\nabout other stuff. Like when people post about karate and I think <br/>\nabout Conor&#39;s disastrous attempts at the dojo. Or how proud I was at <br/>\nCasey&#39;s talent in gymnastics only to have her break my proud mama&#39;s <br/>\nheart and quit because they were putting too much pressure on her. So <br/>\nI can&#39;t claim brown belt or level 5/6 gymnast&#39;s mother status.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think these thoughts do catch us from time to time. The trick is to <br/>\njust observe them for what they are-thoughts. They don&#39;t define us or <br/>\nour children. Being aware of them makes it that much easier to watch <br/>\nthem come and watch them go. No need to hold on to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84256943,"authorName":"LauraBourdo@aol.com","from":"LauraBourdo@...","profile":"crazeemom77043","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Somebody slap me...please!","postDate":"1052424889","msgId":68155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUuMmZmNzlkNzEuMmJlYzE0YjlAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":68154,"nextInTopic":68162,"prevInTime":68154,"nextInTime":68156,"topicId":68081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 05/08/2003 10:07:34 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

And this can be overcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little girl next door who played with us and did all kinds of crafts etc. until school came along gets &quot;reader&quot; of the month and reads with the principal etc.  My daughter is able to cheer her on - without the competitive spirit of knowing that far before this she was helping this girl to read. I am very proud of her because , the thought has crossed my mind that my daughter who has been a fabulous reader would surely have been &quot;reader of the month&quot;  at least once. But thankfully, she doesn&#39;t carry that competitive baggage and just does what she does because she enjoys it - not because someone will recognize her for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal story is similar to the ones I have heard. I was a very bright student - all honors and everything. I didn&#39;t LOVE school - and got by with as little work as possible ( even though my grades were great). I constantly heard all my life how smart I was, and my parents were always so happy with my achievements. I too started college and got married and had three kids in the middle. I continued to go part-time for 7 years and finally graduated. Of course my Father was thrilled thinking I would get on with it and make the &quot;real money&quot; etc.  Guess what - I am finding that the journey that I started with my children is far more fulfilling than some big, corporate job with lots of monetary recognition.  I do have deep conflicts where in reality I know the time I am taking with my children is the most important - but I constantly feel that nagging feeling of &quot;not living up to my potential&quot; that I heard all my life.  I also am finding with the few interviews that I went on that the fact that I have a great grade point average and was recognized as an outstanding scholar - means little in comparison with work experience (or lack thereof).  The point is - although I know logically that what I am doing right now is the best thing I can be doing for my children- the praise and recognition I received as a child for good grades, etc. stops once you stop performing in that arena and I often have issues of feeling inadequate for what I think I lack. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, try and joy in the fact that your daughter is a wonderful person - and that she has so many qualities that are valuable in life. Getting academic, sports or other recognition doesn&#39;t do much for you once the moment is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I found most appealing about unschooling - was letting my children develop whatever talents they have that they want to develop. I will not  jump on them and insist they practice the piano or whatever because I see &quot;budding potential&quot;. They may hate the piano. The way I see it - if you are doing what you love - that is where you will find the most success and happiness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still trying to figure out what that is for me. It doesn&#39;t make any difference if you got great grades - and lack real skills. I am sure I have some - but what they are is difficult to discern. How sad it is that to have gone through years and years of &quot;school&quot; and still not have some concrete skill that is useful!  So, I guess I will be using my time now developing whatever it is, I didn&#39;t have the time to develop while I was performing academically!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case - that type of recognition is so temporary. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;True Success is being able to live your life in your own way&quot;  Charles Morley (?)<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LauraBourdo@...\">LauraBourdo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 08, 2003 2:15 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Somebody slap me...please!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Backstory (in other words, don&#39;t slap me yet):<br/>\n  I&#39;m relatively new to unschooling (2 years), and came into it too late with <br/>\n  my kids to persuade my eldest to leave ps behind.  I am therefore in the <br/>\n  peculiar position of living the *educational extremes* -- unschooling my now <br/>\n  almost 15 yo ds, and supporting my 18 yo dd as she finishes her public high <br/>\n  school career.  Believe me, it&#39;s weird sometimes.  Okay.  Most of the time.  <br/>\n  My heart is really with unschooling, but it didn&#39;t fit dd under her <br/>\n  circumstances at the time we made the leap.  I have to accept that and not <br/>\n  allow myself to be overcome with regrets.  The conflicting emotions, however, <br/>\n  are another story entirely...<br/>\n<br/>\n  My little problem:<br/>\n  I went tonight to dd&#39;s annual sports awards banquet.  She&#39;s a 4 year <br/>\n  basketball letterman -- enthusiastic if not highly successful (in the <br/>\n  prototypical sense).  As a matter of fact, that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m stumbling <br/>\n  over tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have raised, in her, a totally marvelous, delightful young woman, full of <br/>\n  exceptional but relatively intangible gifts -- a terrific sense of humor, a <br/>\n  wonderful way with people, an open and loving heart, a positive <br/>\n  self-image...you get the idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What she&#39;s NOT is successful in terms that the world (especially the <br/>\n  perverse, hypocritical, overly competitive world of public high school) <br/>\n  appreciates and recognizes.  She is an average student and athlete, has <br/>\n  friends but is not *popular*, has enjoyed high school but has very little to <br/>\n  show for the time she spent there in terms of extracurricular activities, is <br/>\n  healthy and attractive but not glamorous.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I sat there tonight and listened as all of these kids were getting special <br/>\n  recognition for exceptional, tangible gifts and skills -- records broken, <br/>\n  scholarships and leadership awards given -- and felt this awful feeling of <br/>\n  jealousy creep up my spine.  Gag!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of my <br/>\n  children, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>\n  that.  I wanted my offspring to be a credit to me.  I wanted the applause for <br/>\n  her accomplishments...for me!  And I knew, as I sat there, with an awful <br/>\n  feeling of despair, that I&#39;ll never get that from either of my children now.  <br/>\n  She&#39;s done, and her brother&#39;s at home -- never to even have a shot at that <br/>\n  sort of acclaim.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now tell me...how sick is THAT?  Who&#39;s being perverse, hypocritical and <br/>\n  overly competitive now?  I&#39;m so ashamed of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, somebody -- please slap some sense back into me.

I am therefore in the <br/>\npeculiar position of living the *educational extremes* -- unschooling my now <br/>\nalmost 15 yo ds, and supporting my 18 yo dd as she finishes her public high <br/>\nschool career.  Believe me, it&#39;s weird sometimes.  Okay.  Most of the time.  <br/>\nMy heart is really with unschooling, but it didn&#39;t fit dd under her <br/>\ncircumstances at the time we made the leap.  I have to accept that and not <br/>\nallow myself to be overcome with regrets.  The conflicting emotions, however, <br/>\nare another story entirely...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy little problem:<br/>\nI went tonight to dd&#39;s annual sports awards banquet.  She&#39;s a 4 year <br/>\nbasketball letterman -- enthusiastic if not highly successful (in the <br/>\nprototypical sense).  As a matter of fact, that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m stumbling <br/>\nover tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have raised, in her, a totally marvelous, delightful young woman, full of <br/>\nexceptional but relatively intangible gifts -- a terrific sense of humor, a <br/>\nwonderful way with people, an open and loving heart, a positive <br/>\nself-image...you get the idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she&#39;s NOT is successful in terms that the world (especially the <br/>\nperverse, hypocritical, overly competitive world of public high school) <br/>\nappreciates and recognizes.  She is an average student and athlete, has <br/>\nfriends but is not *popular*, has enjoyed high school but has very little to <br/>\nshow for the time she spent there in terms of extracurricular activities, is <br/>\nhealthy and attractive but not glamorous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat there tonight and listened as all of these kids were getting special <br/>\nrecognition for exceptional, tangible gifts and skills -- records broken, <br/>\nscholarships and leadership awards given -- and felt this awful feeling of <br/>\njealousy creep up my spine.  Gag!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never, in a gazillion years, breathe a word of this to either of my <br/>\nchildren, but it&#39;s there like a cancer, inside me.  I wanted a child like <br/>\nthat.  I wanted my offspring to be a credit to me.  I wanted the applause for <br/>\nher accomplishments...for me!  And I knew, as I sat there, with an awful <br/>\nfeeling of despair, that I&#39;ll never get that from either of my children now.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s done, and her brother&#39;s at home -- never to even have a shot at that <br/>\nsort of acclaim.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow tell me...how sick is THAT?  Who&#39;s being perverse, hypocritical and <br/>\noverly competitive now?  I&#39;m so ashamed of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, somebody -- please slap some sense back into me.  I need to regain my <br/>\nperspective.  The tentacles of a twisted world are wrapping themselves around <br/>\nme and I&#39;m having a hard time breathing...<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me, please, with all of the poetic wisdom of which I know you&#39;re <br/>\ncapable, that we really are doing the right thing here, and that this, too, <br/>\nshall pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68229,"nextTopicId":68069}}
