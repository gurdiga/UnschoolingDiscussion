We take over a local park and there are<br/>\n300+ families that come out.  It is our largest attended function of the<br/>\nyear.  It is a celebration that our children aren&#39;t in public school.  Not<br/>\nall the families are unschoolers, but they are growing.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe just went shopping for supplies and had a blast.  It&#39;s really more of a<br/>\nreplenishing shopping trip.  Our girls love to have those new composition<br/>\nbooks for poetry, cartoons, short stories, ect.  They love to write with the<br/>\ngel pens in rainbow colors.  I think I have more fun...I pick out new stuff<br/>\nfor me, too!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs far as spreading the word of unschooling, I take an &quot;attraction rather<br/>\nthan promotion&quot; approach.  I live unschooling and people can see that in my<br/>\nlife.  They come to me with questions about how we do it.  If I were to<br/>\nchase them down, they&#39;d feel assaulted.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat&#39;s my take on it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79113,"nextTopicId":79126}}
