For Jon Phillip.. he is the most atheltic and <br/>\ncoordinated child I have. He learned to ride a bike ( w/o training wheels) at <br/>\nbarely 4.  He is very creative and imaginative.   He is very funny and <br/>\nbright.   He can be soooo sweet and loving and considerate ( and he can be a <br/>\nreal pill too, as Ive described earlier)   He is the most attached child Ive <br/>\nhad.  He still sleeps with us at 7 and half.   He really likes to be &quot;babied&quot; <br/>\n, carried sometimes, held and cuddled etc. But, he is also very independent <br/>\nwhen he wants to be.  He is very friendly and outgoing and gets along well <br/>\nwith others.  He sort of the risk taking, &quot;i&#39;m invincible&quot; type ( recall the <br/>\nflaming stick in the eye and the recent wax head incident)  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My amatuer psychoanalysis/gut feeling is that he is a natural thumb sucker <br/>\nand he continues to suck his thumb happily at home because he hasnt gotten <br/>\nany negative feedback from his immediate family.   BUT, I think the shirt <br/>\nchewing came as a replacement for the thumb sucking when he started school.  <br/>\nHe DID get some negative feedback, mostly from his evil witch teacher who <br/>\ntold him she would cut off his thumb if he kept sucking it ( which I didnt <br/>\nfind out til MUCH later)   Of course she said it in a joking ,not really <br/>\nserious tone,  (in her description, that is)    Anyway, he didnt start the <br/>\nshirt chewing til he was in Kindergarten.  I think it was Ren who also <br/>\nnoticed that maybe the shirt chewing is the &quot;public&quot; equivalent to the thumb <br/>\nsucking at home or other comfortable places.   I really think that JP sucks <br/>\nhis thumb and chews his shirt as a coping mechanism.  And, that is OK with <br/>\nme.  If that is what helps him relax and feel content, I think he has the <br/>\nright to do it.    I think I mentioned earlier that I am a bit concerned over <br/>\nknowing when HE wants to quit and it becomes a habit he wants to break, and <br/>\nhow to help him break it.  I guess I will deal with that when the time comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1572768,"authorName":"Stephanie Elms","from":"&quot;Stephanie Elms&quot; &lt;stephanie.elms@...&gt;","profile":"elmsfam","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] thumbsucking","postDate":"1040360539","msgId":52526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDEzREM4NDdAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52525,"nextInTopic":52542,"prevInTime":52525,"nextInTime":52527,"topicId":52517,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh...forgot to mention that Jason is very sensitive with clothing...we cut the tags out of his shirts, he wears his socks inside out (so the seams don t bother","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-116356177\">Oh...forgot to mention that Jason is very sensitive with clothing...we cut the tags out<br/>\nof his shirts, he wears his socks inside out (so the seams don&#39;t bother him), he will not<br/>\nwear socks with terry cloth inside (which means that I pretty much buy girls white bobby <br/>\nsocks), he will not wear jeans and we really had a hard time finding pants for him when<br/>\nhe outgrew the cotton ones this year.
