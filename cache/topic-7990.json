It has saved me <br/>\nfrom a hip replacement and a lot of pain.  I have hip dysplasia and <br/>\nspondololotheosis (spelling?) of the back.  I started going to her 5 months <br/>\nafter my first son was born (shoulder dystocia, blue baby, not breathing, <br/>\noxygen strapped on me, nurse &quot;standing&quot; on my stomach, etc. I lived it too!) <br/>\nbecause I was in so much pain.  I had been to a neurosurgeon who wanted to <br/>\ndo surgery on me or I could wait and have a hip replacement 10-15 years down <br/>\nthe road.  I stumbled upon my chiropractor and have been very pleased.  She <br/>\nadjusts our sons and my husband also.  Anyway it took over a year before I <br/>\nbecame completely pain free, but it was worth it!  My second delivery went <br/>\nso smooth it was unbelievable!  I just wanted to let you know that we have <br/>\nhad success with chiropractic.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 502<br/>\n&gt;Date: 10 Apr 2000 23:35:35 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Avoid the lines and visit avis.com for quick and easy online<br/>\n&gt;reservations.

The new<br/>\n&gt;   publication will premier on the Web later this spring and the<br/>\n&gt;   magazine will launch with issues in September and December<br/>\n&gt;   of 2000.

I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He simply FED me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Damian.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ron and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he<br/>\n&gt;knows<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more<br/>\n&gt;confused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH<br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he<br/>\n&gt;may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire<br/>\n&gt;process<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant<br/>\n&gt;without a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that<br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in<br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ron and Stephanie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

Hope no-one<br/>\n&gt;minds :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Bridget, I know what you mean.  I don&#39;t want to get offensive, but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;mean that formula is &#39;just as good.&#39;  It&#39;s an inferior product, but babies<br/>\n&gt;can still thrive on it, my own daughter, touch wood, has no physical<br/>\n&gt;problems with it.  The point is that unless people take breastfeeding down<br/>\n&gt;from it&#39;s pedestal and say &#39;This is the natural thing to do,&#39; some people<br/>\n&gt;are going to hold it up as an unapproachable ideal, which I did to an<br/>\n&gt;extent with the general lifestyle portrayed in the Art of Breastfeeding (GB<br/>\n&gt;and NZ version from about 10 years ago.)  I was heartbroken when I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;continue breastfeeding Heather, partly because I&#39;d held it up so high.<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve been sent the article I was talking about, I&#39;ll attach it.  If<br/>\n&gt;the group doesn&#39;t accept attachments, I can send it privately to anyone who<br/>\n&gt;wants it, or if the consensus of the list agrees, I can cut-and-paste it to<br/>\n&gt;the list.

I know you wanted the discussion closed, but I would like to<br/>\n&gt;add a few more thoughts.  You don&#39;t have to read them if you don&#39;t want :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am glad that you have reached a decision that works for you both.  And<br/>\n&gt;while I understand the desire for the husband to bond with the child, I<br/>\n&gt;think I have to point out that there are so many ways that we bond with our<br/>\n&gt;babies, feeding is only one of them.  There are many breastfeeding fathers<br/>\n&gt;who feel well-connected to their children, and their partners no doubt feel<br/>\n&gt;indebted for their commitment to their families&#39; well-being.  Yes,<br/>\n&gt;expressing milk is the next best thing to breastfeeding, with, according to<br/>\n&gt;the WHO other mothers&#39; expressed milk next and formula fourth and last on<br/>\n&gt;the priority list.  I would add other mother breastfeeding (in cases where<br/>\n&gt;maternal breastfeeding is not possible, rather than not desired) &#39;wet<br/>\n&gt;nursing,&#39; below maternal breastfeeding in this list, because there is much<br/>\n&gt;more to breastfeeding than nutritional content.  This is what was so<br/>\n&gt;upsetting for me. I knew that while some babies have allergic reactions to<br/>\n&gt;formula, some babies suffer medical problems later in life due to<br/>\n&gt;bottlefeeding, I have not suffered any visible effects (yet) from being<br/>\n&gt;bottlefed.  I wanted my children to experience the whole experience of<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding, the skin contact, the physical developmental differences...<br/>\n&gt;I wanted to experience breastfeeding, the hormonal rush, the skin contact.<br/>\n&gt;It was particularly important for me since Heather had spent time in SCBU<br/>\n&gt;that I become the only person who could provide this for my daughter.<br/>\n&gt;Other people can do anything else for a baby, and in some societies, even<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding is widely shared.  But it is a very special thing for a<br/>\n&gt;mother to share with her baby, and I am glad that I experienced it, and<br/>\n&gt;still do, with my second child.  Now, if only I could persuade her to<br/>\n&gt;stop.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for listening here, and I hope your dialogue continues, since I<br/>\n&gt;think that parenting issues are never really closed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;PS  I have to admire your commitment to expressing, I found it to be very<br/>\n&gt;difficult and did not produce enough to feed my daughter fully after a few<br/>\n&gt;weeks, even though I had provided for her completely while she was on the<br/>\n&gt;SCBU.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-----------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Wendy, you&#39;re right, that&#39;s why I made the point that I don&#39;t speak for LLL<br/>\n&gt;earlier :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But I&#39;d be interested to know what exactly you think gave LLL a bad name,<br/>\n&gt;either on or off list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Tracy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 8<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 10 Apr 2000 07:37:03 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: The light bulb moment<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t remember learning to read either but DO remember starting school<br/>\n&gt;and getting in trouble for already reading and writing cursive.

As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He simply FED me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Damian.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ron and Stephanie wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he<br/>\n&gt;knows<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more<br/>\n&gt;confused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH<br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I<br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he<br/>\n&gt;may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire<br/>\n&gt;process<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant<br/>\n&gt;without a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that<br/>\n&gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in<br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ron and Stephanie<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; LOW RATE, NO WAIT!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

But I have seen my sister in law recently go through<br/>\n&gt;breastfeeding problems (challenges!!) that really opened my eyes to how <br/>\n&gt;much<br/>\n&gt;of an unbelievable challenge it can be.  She had all kinds of support ( her<br/>\n&gt;Midwife, My wife who is also a Midwife, and a lactation consultant) but she<br/>\n&gt;still says labout was nothing in comparison to the emotional challenges of<br/>\n&gt;the first couple of months of breastfeeding.  Since then I have noticed <br/>\n&gt;many<br/>\n&gt;other of my wife&#39;s clients with similar challenges.  It can be a enormous<br/>\n&gt;challenge, and, for instance, if my sister in law had not been successful <br/>\n&gt;at<br/>\n&gt;surmounting all her challenges, I would NEVER hold it against her... even <br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;it was medically possible.  I think that by saying there are only 1-2% of<br/>\n&gt;women who cannot breastfeed that it invalidates the experiences of so many<br/>\n&gt;women who have such extreme challenges, which may come from a variety of<br/>\n&gt;sources...   The last thing a woman needs after deciding it is too<br/>\n&gt;challenging for HER to breastfeed is a whole lot of guilt.  On the other<br/>\n&gt;hand, I am completely in favor of promoting breastfeeding as the first<br/>\n&gt;choice, and providing all the support and information that can be provided<br/>\n&gt;to make the chances of success as high as possible.<br/>\n&gt;Just another mans openion....<br/>\n&gt;(I feel funny chiming in on this topic as a man... but I have been reading<br/>\n&gt;the posts for a long time... and I feel I shouldn&#39;t hold back my thoughts<br/>\n&gt;just on account of my gender)<br/>\n&gt;Joshua<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;check out www.alladvantage.com to get paid to surf the net.<br/>\n&gt;MY user ID# is LUZ-400<br/>\n&gt;----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;From: Sonia Ulan &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sulan@...\">sulan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sent: Monday, April 10, 2000 2:25 AM<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] A father&#39;s view<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missed out on.

I truly feel that he would be more<br/>\n&gt;confused<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH<br/>\n&gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I <br/>\n&gt;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he <br/>\n&gt;may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire<br/>\n&gt;process<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant<br/>\n&gt;without a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has <br/>\n&gt;been<br/>\n&gt;a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeding?

I don&#39;t know what criteria they use, but I do know that I <br/>\n&gt;wasn&#39;t asked because I was sleeping off a sleeping tablet, Heather&#39;s birth <br/>\n&gt;was short in time but makes a fairly long story, for a natural birth :-)  <br/>\n&gt;So they couldn&#39;t ask me to express either.  What interested me was that <br/>\n&gt;they never asked the mothers expressing for their babies if any excess <br/>\n&gt;could be used for other babies.  I know mothers donating milk have to be <br/>\n&gt;tested for HIV and other diseases, but surely that doesn&#39;t take that long, <br/>\n&gt;and it&#39;s more appropriate to give milk to babies of around the same <br/>\n&gt;gestation and age, if you know what I mean.  A fact-finding mission to <br/>\n&gt;China found the mothers expressing milk into enamelware bowls to give to <br/>\n&gt;babies who needed it, they were specifically matched for gestational age <br/>\n&gt;and age from birth, as close as possible.

He&#39;s also told us what <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;said about many babies being born out of alignment, probably due to the<br/>\n&gt;strange delivery techniques doctors are known to use.  I don&#39;t know much<br/>\n&gt;about the benefits of chiropractic - I may just have to look into it a <br/>\n&gt;little<br/>\n&gt;bit more.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing more about your experience with it.<br/>\n&gt;Take care.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jodye<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jodye<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 23<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 10 Apr 2000 18:20:10 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HSMOTGO@...\">HSMOTGO@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: chat channel for children<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Great!

I would be<br/>\n&gt;concerned about what this childish behaviour of his is a precursor<br/>\n&gt;to, I seriously think he needs counselling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Damian Ulan wrote: [very eloquently]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I used to wonder about DH.... back in Australia it is more<br/>\n&gt;commonly used as an abbreviation for something else.<br/>\n&gt;Welcome Damian, good to hear a man&#39;s perspective on this<br/>\n&gt;subject.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Although you want this subject to be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;But Damian, some men see this obviously very intimate<br/>\n&gt;relationship as excluding them, whereas you are drawn into the<br/>\n&gt;intimacy and become a part of it.<br/>\n&gt;There is no denying the sensuality of breast feeding, and I feel this<br/>\n&gt;is what can be a problem for some men, and women too.<br/>\n&gt;Our warped view of the body mainly stemming from religious beliefs<br/>\n&gt;where the natural and beautiful functions of the body are made<br/>\n&gt;sinful, has caused too many people to regard breast feeding as a<br/>\n&gt;deviant behaviour.<br/>\n&gt;When I breast fed my first child [I turned 18 two days before his<br/>\n&gt;birth] I encountered a lot of negative vibes from society in general,<br/>\n&gt;this was back in &#39;73.  If I was out anywhere with him I would rush<br/>\n&gt;home to feed him, I was uncomfortable nursing in front of anyone<br/>\n&gt;except for my husband, and this was a real pity.  With each baby I<br/>\n&gt;noticed society&#39;s perception of breast feeding changing, it got to<br/>\n&gt;the point when I had my last baby in &#39;96, that people are more<br/>\n&gt;likely to frown on a woman giving a baby a bottle than seeing a<br/>\n&gt;woman nursing.  To my way of thinking, no-one should frown at<br/>\n&gt;either, because as we know for different reasons not all women can<br/>\n&gt;breast feed their infants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As you point out, a man doesn&#39;t have to be able to feed a baby to<br/>\n&gt;bond with him/her, there are so many things that a Father can do<br/>\n&gt;with/for his child that don&#39;t require him to be a pseudo Mother.<br/>\n&gt;Babies don&#39;t need two Mothers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-  Sue   -<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt;My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm\">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, is to be dishonest.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;-Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 10 Apr 2000 23:35:22 GMT<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;M&quot;&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mulghaz@...\">mulghaz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: former unschoolers<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;All right!
