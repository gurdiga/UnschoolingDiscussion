These boxes are given to children in places that often are lucky to have a roof and food, nevermind toys.It helps the children to get their focus off of what&#39;s in it for me to how can I help someone else. I guess if you are not a christian, most of these ideas may not help much. Either way we feel Christmas should be a wonderful time of family and sharing.<br/>\nJohanna <br/>\nLife is the ultimate learning experience!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 25, 2001 4:56 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Santa Claus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know we began having this discussion and was wondering if some of you may <br/>\n  indulge me a bit.

He&#39;s a fun make believe character. Sometimes the kids used to like to<br/>\npretend he was real but then, they like to pretend Mickey Mouse is real too!<br/>\nWe also talk about the origins of the modern day Santa and how other<br/>\ncountries have their version of Santa. Our reasons for this are many. In<br/>\npart, I found out that Santa wasn&#39;t real in 4th grade the hard way (I was a<br/>\nbit of a naive child). It was very upsetting and embarrassing. I also don&#39;t<br/>\nlike to give credit to Santa for the presents I take the time to pick out.<br/>\nWe live in a small townhouse and with four kids, I don&#39;t have enough good<br/>\nhiding places. And I don&#39;t like like to add to the commercialism and the<br/>\ngimmee-gimme of the holiday that already exists. We&#39;ve never said Santa was<br/>\nbad or evil and we still hide some of the presents to put out Christmas Eve<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s fun to get up and see what surprises await. We try to make sure<br/>\nthe kids don&#39;t spoil the secret for other kids. Though some have implied<br/>\nthat we&#39;ve denied our kids a rite of childhood, they don&#39;t seem to have<br/>\nsuffered for it. Now that they are getting to be teens they don&#39;t wish we<br/>\nhad pretended Santa was real.(yes, I did ask). It was never a big deal for<br/>\nus. And I don&#39;t think Christmas was any less fun by not having Santa bring<br/>\npresents.<br/>\nApril<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lite2yu@...\">lite2yu@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 25, 2001 5:57 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Santa Claus<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know we began having this discussion and was wondering if some of you<br/>\nmay<br/>\n  indulge me a bit.
