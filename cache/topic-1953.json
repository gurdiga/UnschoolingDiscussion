It doesn&#39;t appear<br/>\nthat they have a website which really surprises me.  How long have<br/>\nyou been getting them and how old are your kids that use them?  I was<br/>\nhesitant to get them for Sterling since he&#39;s only 3 yo but figured i<br/>\ncan always cancel if there wasn&#39;t enough for his skill level yet.<br/>\nHe&#39;s always liked finding hidden pictures.  we&#39;ve gotten the &quot;I spy&quot;<br/>\nseries from the library a few times so figured he&#39;d like the<br/>\nhighlights hidden pictures.  i found there is quite a nice mix of<br/>\nthings he can do as well as many that are far too advanced for him<br/>\nyet.  but that&#39;s okay, the challenge is there when he is ready and he<br/>\nhas already shocked me with some that i expected him to ignore...<br/>\nlike the &quot;find-a-word&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Michele Moss</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1951,"nextTopicId":1961}}
