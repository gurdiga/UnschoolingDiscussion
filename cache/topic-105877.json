There&#39;s an odd kind of particular writing <br/>\ncalled &quot;away messages&quot; (on Instant Messenger and such services),  and here are a <br/>\nfew of Kirby&#39;s:  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   Well, I&#39;m off to school to see what everyone was bitching about <br/>\nfor all those years!<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   <br/>\nHey! What are you looking at? Haven&#39;t you ever seen someone pick their nose <br/>\nbefore? Geez...give a guy some privacy.<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   I&#39;m out with my Halo Gang. Yeah, I&#39;m in a gang... I do what I <br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one&#39;s a quote, and cited:<br/>\n<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   You know, when a tomato grows out of your forehead, it gets you <br/>\nthinking. What do we know about anything? Life is just a big, wild, crazy <br/>\ntossed salad. But you don&#39;t eat it; no sir! You live it! Isn&#39;t it great? Isn&#39;t it <br/>\ngreat? - The Tic<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\nAnd this one he didn&#39;t cite but says it was on someone&#39;s blog and he liked it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto response from Zolo Hexx:  Checking away messages. It&#39;s like stalking, <br/>\nbut no one knows you are doing it. I even have people&#39;s names on my buddy list <br/>\nthat  I don&#39;t know, but I hear they have really good away messages. Some people <br/>\nreally  put their all into away messages. There are the people who document <br/>\ntheir every  move: &quot;I am taking a shower, but when I get out, I am going to <br/>\npee, shave, and  then iron my pants. Call me if you need me before I go to the <br/>\nmall at 2pm.&quot; Then  there&#39;s the creative one: &quot;I am away from my computer right <br/>\nnow.&quot; And of course  there&#39;s that one from the really cool guy: &quot;Yo its friday <br/>\nnight, I am drunk, and  not sittin up lookin at away messages&quot; Funny how that <br/>\nguy never seems to go  idle.<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s someone else&#39;s creative writing. &lt;g&gt;  Kirby says:<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   It was in something that they did for people to use in their <br/>\nIM&#39;s.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Oh, like pre-recorded phone-machine messages, in the old days <br/>\nwhen you put a tape in the machine, maybe?<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Some people would buy famous-voice or humorous answering machine <br/>\ntapes.<br/>\nSandraDodd:  Like you can get custom &quot;You&#39;ve got mail&quot; and such.<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   Oh I know.<br/>\nZolo Hexx:   But yes, quite a bit like that.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105816,"nextTopicId":105879}}
