Likewise, we label our PB oatmeal cookies so nut <br/>\nallergic people can stay clear as well as dairy people (they contain <br/>\nyogurt) but there&#39;s no added sugars (uses mashed banana) so folks <br/>\nwant to know that too. We just list ingredients on a 3x5 card and <br/>\ntape it to the container. And, if there&#39;s someone we particularly <br/>\nknow is dairy sensitive or veg. and we&#39;ve brought a dish they might <br/>\nenjoy, we&#39;ll let them know off to the side which is ours - one <br/>\nperson even has started checking in with us because we often bring <br/>\nmeatless, dairyless, dishes (just because we know there are folks <br/>\nthere who might otherwise not have an option - like when the <br/>\nmain &#39;theme&#39; is chili, DH makes an awesome vegan chili so we make <br/>\nsure the non-meat folks know which is our pot).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents as a potlucker (is that even a word?LOL)<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194965079,"authorName":"Pam Tellew","from":"Pam Tellew &lt;pamtellew@...&gt;","profile":"warblwarbl2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: San Francisco Bay Area Unschoolers&#39; Picnic","postDate":"1120674865","msgId":107159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4xLjEuMC4yMDA1MDcwNjExMzAxMi4wMGMyMWZhMEBtYWlsLmludGVyZ2F0ZS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjA2NDQwMjUuNDI5LjczOTMxLm0xN0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107160,"prevInTime":107158,"nextInTime":107160,"topicId":107159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Re potluck food: Betsy, I m sure there will be vegans and sugar avoiders, but they can always figure things out for themselves.
