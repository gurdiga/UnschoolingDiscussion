But we also<br/>\n&gt; have to acknowledge that it is a culturally-contrived thing. Someone who<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; artistically &quot;gifted&quot; in one culture would not be seen so in another. And<br/>\n&gt; many, many artists die poor and unknown because their &quot;gifts&quot; were not<br/>\neven<br/>\n&gt; recognized in the culture they were born in. Someone who is intellectually<br/>\n&gt; &quot;gifted&quot; may be able to compute the world&#39;s most complex formula, but be<br/>\n&gt; unable to complete a grocery shopping excursion. The very label &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\n&gt; implies some universal ability to do everything, when in reality it is a<br/>\n&gt; narrow set of abilities we are talking about when we use that word. No-one<br/>\n&gt; on earth is truly &quot;gifted&quot; in everything, thus most people have gifts in<br/>\none<br/>\n&gt; area or another. To choose to use the label &quot;gifted&quot; to only refer to one<br/>\n&gt; such set of abilities is harmful in my opinion, both to the person who is<br/>\n&gt; being labeled, and perhaps more so, to those who are not labeled as such.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Robin!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour entire post was great, just copied a small part above.

I see<br/>\nno purpose in using the gifted term at all in the realm of unschooling, we<br/>\nunschool  in order to avoid such limiting labels.  The idea of giftedness is<br/>\njust a new, more acceptable way of the old tracking system.  The school<br/>\nsystems are still set up to provide a set of workers, they certainly don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to convince all the kids that they are talented, and capable, or who<br/>\nwill be willing to do the low paid &#39;grunt&#39; work.  Anyway I don&#39;t have the<br/>\ntime to really finish this thought right now, but you expressed so much that<br/>\nI wanted to say, and in a much more coherent form than I seem to be capable<br/>\nof, at the present time.  BTW, there were no gifted programs way back when I<br/>\nwas in school, but I had the right look- and I was put into all the A track<br/>\nclasses, which were filled with the neatly dressed white kids from &#39;good&#39;<br/>\nhomes.

He has gone on<br/>\nto become a commercially-rated pilot, airplane mechanic, and then start up<br/>\nhis own mega-succcessful businesses. He&#39;s a born natural &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\nbusinessman if you ask me, but of course that&#39;s yet another talent that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t measure on the &quot;gifted&quot; meter of schooling or IQ tests and it took<br/>\nhim the better part of 20 years to get past the negative labeling and see<br/>\nhimself for the truly talented individual that he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are probably both what would be called &quot;gifted&quot; if I ever had to put<br/>\nthem into a school environment. Certainly with my son (4), I have already<br/>\nhad to endure comments, even from random strangers, about his &quot;giftedness&quot;.<br/>\nPeople come up to me and tell me I should be enrolling him in this or that<br/>\nschool to take advantage of his abilities. He wrote his first words at just<br/>\npast his 2nd birthday, wanted to teach himself Spanish at 3, etc. etc. etc..<br/>\nMy daughter at age 1 is already making sentences and complex inferences,<br/>\npeople are already telling me how &quot;bright&quot; she is. As a child of such<br/>\nlabels, I must say I cringe inwardly whenever I hear these. So that&#39;s my<br/>\nbackground, FWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a><br/>\n&gt; But my point was that giftedness (intellectual and artistic) does exist.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; deny it doesn&#39;t seem to serve any purpose to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anything can exist if we want to see it, and if our culture constructs it.<br/>\nIf we see that some kids are &quot;gifted&quot; in a specific set of activities or<br/>\nvalues, and then apply that label to them - well, it exists! But we also<br/>\nhave to acknowledge that it is a culturally-contrived thing. Someone who is<br/>\nartistically &quot;gifted&quot; in one culture would not be seen so in another. And<br/>\nmany, many artists die poor and unknown because their &quot;gifts&quot; were not even<br/>\nrecognized in the culture they were born in. Someone who is intellectually<br/>\n&quot;gifted&quot; may be able to compute the world&#39;s most complex formula, but be<br/>\nunable to complete a grocery shopping excursion. The very label &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\nimplies some universal ability to do everything, when in reality it is a<br/>\nnarrow set of abilities we are talking about when we use that word. No-one<br/>\non earth is truly &quot;gifted&quot; in everything, thus most people have gifts in one<br/>\narea or another. To choose to use the label &quot;gifted&quot; to only refer to one<br/>\nsuch set of abilities is harmful in my opinion, both to the person who is<br/>\nbeing labeled, and perhaps more so, to those who are not labeled as such.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Identifying someone as more capable doesn&#39;t take away from anyone else and<br/>\n&gt; may help that person&#39;s family provide what they need in order to thrive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can definitely see how the &quot;gifted&quot; label can help people whose kids are<br/>\nin school. After all, school is an artificially constructed environment with<br/>\na narrow focus on a certain set of abilities that are prized, to the<br/>\ndetriment of others. But I guess I wonder how labeling a child as &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>\nhelps the family in an unschooling environment. Whether or not we have that<br/>\nlabel, we have the capability to meet our child&#39;s needs for whatever<br/>\nknowledge they need to achieve whatever they want to achieve (or to help<br/>\nenable them to find creative ways to meet their needs for knowledge<br/>\nthemselves). This is no different for the child who wants to master<br/>\nastrophysics than for the child who wants to create clay pots, learn to<br/>\nrepair bicycles, or act in dramatic productions. And I do argue that<br/>\n&quot;identifying someone as more capable&quot; *does* take away from others, because<br/>\nby nature of making that statement, we are narrowing our definition of<br/>\ncapable. Capable of what? Identifying a bird? Tearing down a V-8 engine and<br/>\nreconstructing it by sight? Solving a complex mathematical problem? Reaching<br/>\nthe next level in a Pokemon game? Cooking a Creme Brulee? Those who are<br/>\nlabeled as &quot;more capable&quot; are really only &quot;more capable&quot; in a certain subset<br/>\nof abilities, and by using that label as if it is all-encompassing (just as<br/>\nusing the label &quot;gifted&quot; in the same way), we are inferring (whether we mean<br/>\nto or not) that other ways of being &quot;capable&quot; or &quot;gifted&quot; are less<br/>\nimportant. Worse, we may miss out on more quiet and subtle abilities in<br/>\nothers. Was Mother Theresa &quot;gifted&quot;?? What about Ghandi?? Abraham Lincoln?<br/>\nUsing these labels only shows what we, as a society, find important to<br/>\nmeasure or to succeed in. Additionally, these labels are most useful when<br/>\npeople are in an artificially age-segregated environment (like school). What<br/>\nare one person&#39;s academic gifts when balanced against another person&#39;s 85<br/>\nyears of accumulated wisdom? What exactly is a &quot;gifted&quot; 10 year old when<br/>\nthey keep company with people ranging in age from 2 to 92? Almost any person<br/>\nof any intellectual ability can find people they can relate to if they look<br/>\noutside their own immediate age-stratified peer group. A 6 year old can play<br/>\nchess with a 50 year old aunt or turn around and play dress-up with their 4<br/>\nyear old sibling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving worked at Microsoft for 10 years, I saw over and over a very<br/>\ninteresting phenomenon occur there. When I worked there, Microsoft was being<br/>\ndeluged by tens of thousands of resumes a month, and we only hired hundreds.<br/>\nThus we were looking for the creme de la creme, and most people coming in to<br/>\nMicrosoft were head of the class, had their Mensa cards firmly in hand, had<br/>\nscored 1400 or above on their SATs, had their Phi Beta Kappa pins, their<br/>\nhonor society memberships, their Summa Cum Laude, etc. They were used to<br/>\nbeing the special, the &quot;gifted&quot; ones, and coming in to a place where<br/>\neveryone else was equally &quot;gifted&quot; was quite a shock. It was interesting to<br/>\nwatch it play out, as many of these &quot;gifted&quot; people had never dealt with<br/>\nother people as peers in their lives. Many of them had few social and life<br/>\nskills. Managers at Microsoft sometimes found themselves doing strange tasks<br/>\nlike helping an employee open a checking account or buy a car - some of<br/>\nthese &quot;gifted&quot; people were truly helpless when it came to real life. A<br/>\nfriend of mine referred to Microsoft as &quot;The Great Sandbox&quot; because often it<br/>\nseemed that way - full of squabbling kids who never grew up in many<br/>\nimportant ways. People whose egos matched their considerable intellectual<br/>\nabilities and impaired their ability to creatively and cooperatively work<br/>\nwith one another. To me, this is the damage that labels can do, and my<br/>\ngreatest task as a parent is to help my children exercise their gifts<br/>\n(whatever they may be), while also giving them the ability to enjoy the<br/>\ncompany of all different types of people, work with people of varying<br/>\ntalents and abilities, acknowledge their own strengths and weaknesses, fail<br/>\nat things, and be able to live life to the fullest in many different arenas.<br/>\nI personally just feel that using a label such as &quot;gifted&quot; in such a narrow<br/>\nway can impair the ability to have a broad base in life.

I have a cousin, a few years older than me, whom my brother and I grew up quite close to.  Being awkward and shy as a child, he tended to not speak out and try not to attract attention to himself.  Being in public school, this worked amazingly well, and he slipped silently through the system until Highschool.  In his later Highschool years he took some sort of IQ testing mandated or suggested for his grade, and lo and behold, he came out with the highest score, high genius level.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis family always knew he was gifted, and his teachers no doubt thought he was smart, but how bored must he have been in school?  And being the oldest in a large family, there was not a lot of time or energy at home for him.  How many opportunities or programs missed him in his growing years that might have enriched him?  How many teachers or administrators might have been made aware of his talents and helped him to benefit from them?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest tragedy is that he was never made aware of his own abilities, always feeling socially awkward because he did not share his peers interests, and crippled by shyness.  He grew into an insecure adult with poor self esteem, never provided the opportunity to shine in the areas where he excelled.  He is better now.  As he matures, advances in his career field, and raises his own children, his self esteem and confidence improve.  But his lack of these crucial elemets in his life may very well have hurt him in numerous immesurable ways.  For one thing, he married another brilliant underachiever who abused him and left him a single father of two.
