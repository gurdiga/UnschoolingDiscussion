We NEVER did a math <br/>\ncurriculum of any kind at all. Have had years and years of not opening <br/>\nany &quot;official&quot; math texts. I can&#39;t say we didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; math, because the <br/>\ntruth is that it comes up in life all the time and there have been a <br/>\nnumber of opportunities throughout the years to show one kid or another <br/>\nhow to do things like add fractions with unlike denominators, etc., but <br/>\nno math program and the amount of time spent on explaining how to &quot;do&quot; <br/>\nmath computations was very minimal. My oldest daughter started taking <br/>\nthe lowest possible level of math in college, because she hadn&#39;t had <br/>\nany instruction and figured she probably had big gaps - so she didn&#39;t <br/>\neven bother with the placement test and just started right out with the <br/>\nmost remedial level. She whizzed through the remedial levels and got up <br/>\ninto more advanced algebra courses and, lo and behold, she LOVES it. <br/>\nShe is ready to transfer to a 4-year university in the next year or so <br/>\n(she&#39;s been at a community college) and I got out of the bed this <br/>\nmorning to discover her on the computer DROOLING over all the math <br/>\ncourses offered at UC Santa Cruz, where she&#39;s planning to go.
