There&#39;s no one there to make you do anything you don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do. Give yourself permission to *not* do chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy making that mental shift it frees you to do the things you want to do. To<br/>\nwhich some people will then say &quot;Yeah, right. If I only do what I want then<br/>\nI&#39;ll do nothing but read, TV and computer. And we&#39;ll live in a pig sty and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll eventually starve.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone *want* to starve? Does anyone *want* to live in a pig sty? Well<br/>\nif they do, then they wouldn&#39;t respond to the suggestion to do what they<br/>\nwant with sarcasm. They&#39;d be responding with joy ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only reason that response seems to make sense is because we assume we&#39;re<br/>\nonly doing chores because that voice in our head makes us. We assume if we<br/>\nget rid of the voice we won&#39;t do the chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s not true. If we give ourselves permission to not do chores, we&#39;ll<br/>\nfind we really do chores because the consequences of not doing them are<br/>\nworse than the consequences of doing them. And we may even find, if we get<br/>\nrid of the voice, that we can do chores because we appreciate what they<br/>\naccomplish. And maybe even get to the point where we can appreciate the<br/>\nprocess of accomplishing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you give yourself permission to only do what you want, then you can clean<br/>\nso you don&#39;t live in a pig sty not because you have to. You can find ways to<br/>\neat because you don&#39;t want to starve. Even better is to cook because you<br/>\nwant to enjoy the process of cooking, try out new recipes, do something with<br/>\nyour kids, or do something that you know will make someone smile.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can scrub the toilet when you notice it&#39;s dirtier than you like it to<br/>\nbe. You can wash the dishes because you&#39;d like to have clean plates. You can<br/>\nwash the sheets because you&#39;d like to have the feeling of clean sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you think of chores in terms of something you want to do, something<br/>\nthat&#39;s important for you, like reading a book, you can in all honesty say<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;d like to have some clean dishes for the morning so I want to get that<br/>\ndone before I go to bed,&quot; just as you might say &quot;I&#39;d like to have some time<br/>\nto watch my favorite show.&quot; And just with watching the favorite show, we<br/>\nhave options. We could skip it. We could tape it (which can cut down the<br/>\ntime it takes to watch it). We could offer to do the game after the show.<br/>\nUnlike reading a book where the purpose is to enjoy the time doing it so we<br/>\ndon&#39;t want it speeded up with &quot;help&quot; ;-), with chores it&#39;s often the end<br/>\nproduct we want so help can shorten the time it takes to get there and free<br/>\nus up for other things. (Though sometimes people appreciate the time alone<br/>\nto think that a job (like washing the dishes) provides for them.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(A little off the topic of &quot;have to&quot; but still on the topic of making chores<br/>\nless of a chore ;-) is finding ways to enjoy what we&#39;re doing. If we&#39;re<br/>\nfolding a child&#39;s clothes it can give us the opportunity to think about how<br/>\ngreat the opportunity is to have the clothes and the child to fold them for.<br/>\nWe can appreciate the fresh smell. We can think about special meals that<br/>\nwe&#39;ve cooked in a pan. It sounds sort of like the advice given to 50&#39;s<br/>\nhousewives to make them happy sappy home makers ;-) But if there&#39;s a path we<br/>\nneed to walk to get to where we want to go, we can walk it with resentment<br/>\nor we can find a way to appreciate the journey.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing with &quot;have to&quot; is that it often prevents us from seeing new<br/>\nways to accomplish something. If we see a tub full of dishes as an<br/>\ninevitable consequence of cooking and eating, then it doesn&#39;t occur to us to<br/>\nrethink the problem. But someone here said they only kept available enough<br/>\nplates for a meal. That way they never had more than a few dishes to wash.<br/>\nMost of us probably have too many clothes in circulation. If there aren&#39;t as<br/>\nmany clothes then laundry will be done more often but the sorting and<br/>\nfolding and returning won&#39;t be a huge chore.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Those are just &quot;out of the box&quot; ways of viewing a couple of chores not<br/>\nintended as suggestions for anyone to adopt.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if that really answered your question. Having a rule would be a<br/>\nlot simpler! Explaining and getting a new philosophy is a lot harder but<br/>\nmore flexible and more rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: responsibility was: Limits/showering","postDate":"1068443255","msgId":84338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNTEwMWMzYTc0ZSQyNDlkOTJhMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDFjMS4xMTcxMTI1NS4yY2UwM2UyM0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8MDAzNDAxYzNhNzM3JDA0Y2U2MWEwJDA1ODVlZTQwQHlvdXJvMGt3a3c5andjPg=="},"prevInTopic":84333,"nextInTopic":84342,"prevInTime":84337,"nextInTime":84339,"topicId":84251,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: J.

Between I am pretty much continually cleaning,<br/>\nwiping, sweeping, picking up.  Not to mention the needed hugs, talks,<br/>\nreferee-ing, etc..  Somebody is hungry, somebody has to go to the dentist,<br/>\nsomebody has gymnastics, somebody has 4-H.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand what you mean. I have also found that a little at a time,<br/>\nand doing things coming and going helps a lot. I have 4 kids, 2 dogs, 3<br/>\ncats, a snake, crabs and 4 fish tanks I am responsible for. The kids have<br/>\nscheduled outtings 3 days of every week. We absolutely have to be up by 9:30<br/>\nin order to be down the street by noon.  Our house is large enough to keep<br/>\nme busy. My kids save everything they have. My husband does too. I have an<br/>\nawful lot here to keep my busy all hours of the day. I&#39;m also pretty anal<br/>\nabout the house and the kids as far as  how they look. That&#39;s my thing and<br/>\nmy family is pretty easy going with appeasing me. &lt;BG&gt; Point is, I have<br/>\nplenty of time to keep the house neat and play with the kids, cook, get them<br/>\nto where they need to go, shop, have computer time and pretty much free time<br/>\nto take care of other things. It is possible. If I&#39;m on the way to the<br/>\nbathroom, I&#39;ll pick something up along the way that needs to get somewhere<br/>\nelse. Which makes it so sometimes I forget about the bathroom!! But<br/>\neventually I do get there. Putting the dishes in a sink of water and leaving<br/>\nthem there is fine. I can&#39;t go out of the house with dishes in the sink but<br/>\nI&#39;ve got to the point where they can stay there for awhile when I&#39;m home.<br/>\nWhile the kids are eating or playing alone is a good time to finish them.<br/>\nSame with vacuuming and dusting and floors, etc. I find that if I do<br/>\ncleaning every single day, I can do it quickly, keep things clean as they<br/>\ndon&#39;t get out of hand and still have things reasonably neat and still have<br/>\nplenty of time for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t have chores and I just volunteered to help with the litter box<br/>\nwhich was my oldest&#39;s only thing to take care of. (that I asked her to do) I<br/>\nask for help with cleaning up the kids stuff but I mostly don&#39;t ask, I just<br/>\ndo and they just do. Do they clean up as much as I would like? No,<br/>\ndefinitely not. But they do help and I have eased way up on what is<br/>\nacceptable to me so as not to put it all on them. So I can have a nice<br/>\ncomfort level attained for me, they are happy and we don&#39;t have chores and<br/>\nrules as to who does what and when. I&#39;m also a joyful house cleaner.

I could let the dishes sit and play the game instead, so in <br/>\nreality to say that I can&#39;t play the game until the dishes are <br/>\nfinished is saying that the dishes are more important than the game.  <br/>\nWhat I have a hard time with is knowing when I do need to put my foot <br/>\ndown and say, &quot;Sorry, I *have* to do the dishes.  Help me and we&#39;ll <br/>\nget done quicker and have time to play&quot;.  How much can they pile up <br/>\nbefore you should say that?  At what point do they *have* to get <br/>\ndone?  Just before it becomes a health and hygiene issue or not until <br/>\nsomeone is starving and doesn&#39;t have a clean plate to eat off of?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the standard varies from household to household as far as <br/>\nwhat housework has to get done when, but if the standard varies, then <br/>\nthe reality is that a lot of times when we say that we *have* to do <br/>\nsomething, we&#39;re saying that I, the mom, am uncomfortable with the <br/>\nmess being at this level and I don&#39;t want to play a game with you <br/>\nwhen there are all these dishes to be done.  <br/>\n<br/>\n Awhile ago when I described the big mess in our playroom, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nget answers like, &quot;Hey, just live with that level of mess.  No one <br/>\nwants to clean it up, fine, it doesn&#39;t have to be done&quot;.  Most people <br/>\nsaid stuff like, &quot;I couldn&#39;t think in a room as messy as you <br/>\ndescribed&quot; or gave me ideas of how to ask the kids for help so that <br/>\nI&#39;d get a better response.  (And I appreciated those responses, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot saying this to argue with those responses by any means, but to <br/>\nbring up a different point).  In reality, I didn&#39;t *have* to clean up <br/>\nthat room for quite awhile.  There was popcorn on the floor, but it <br/>\nprobably could have sat there for awhile before it attracted any bugs <br/>\nor rodents.  There were toys and stuff all over the floor but we <br/>\nprobably could have stepped over it for quite awhile before the level <br/>\nof junk in the room got so bad that it became a real safety or fire <br/>\nhazard.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo really, in my case, I didn&#39;t clean up because I absolutely *had* <br/>\nto, but because I WANTED to.  The mess got to the point where at that <br/>\nmoment in time I wanted it cleaned more than I wanted to play with <br/>\nthe kids or even more than I wanted to sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe as unschoolers know that everyone&#39;s brains work differently, and <br/>\nwhen we talk about housework that *has* to be done, I suspect our <br/>\nminds all have different pictures.  I think of work that *has to* be <br/>\ndone as someone is dying of thirst but doesn&#39;t have anything to drink <br/>\nout of or someone wants to go outside but doesn&#39;t have any clean <br/>\npants to wear. I wouldn&#39;t say that I *have to* go shopping when there <br/>\nisn&#39;t even any dry cereal or crackers left in the house, but I would <br/>\nnever *want* to let myself get to the point where that&#39;s all we have <br/>\nleft.  So in reality, when I say I *have* to go shopping, the truth <br/>\nis that I wouldn&#39;t *have* to, I *want* to.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think as moms what we tend to do is criticize other mom&#39;s levels of <br/>\ncomfort.  &quot;Her house is always so messy.  She *should* clean more.  <br/>\nOr, she&#39;s always cleaning, she *should* play with her kids more and <br/>\nnot worry so much about the mess.  But except in rare circumstances <br/>\nwhere there&#39;s total filth and unhealthy conditions, everyone is <br/>\nchoosing what they *want* to do.    Maybe we should all just follow <br/>\nour hearts and do what seems right to us?  Maybe it&#39;s ok to let the <br/>\ndishes go one day because our heart of hearts on that day is desiring <br/>\nnothing more but to play with the kids, but on other days, our heart <br/>\nof hearts is really yearning for a spotless kitchen?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I have read this a few times on the list.
