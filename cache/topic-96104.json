My mom was a lot like <br/>\nwhat has been described over and over in the posts here.  My dad <br/>\nworked long hours and went to college on and off while we were <br/>\ngrowing up.  He DID make time to coach the numerous teams that my two <br/>\nbrothers, one sister were involved in.  Anyway, it turns out that he <br/>\nwas feeling left out in the huggin and kissin department.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember him being really affectionate, but again, he was at least <br/>\nTHERE.  So my mom sits him down and explains to him that in order to <br/>\nget affection from his four kids, their spouses and his 7 grandkids, <br/>\nhe needs to show affection.  Low and behold, he did and is getting <br/>\nall the lovin&#39; he could ask for now!  Dad&#39;s can be redeemed if they <br/>\nwant.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96083,"nextTopicId":96108}}
