I use to be on this list quite a long time ago, so I doubt if anyone would remember me.  I just thought I jump right in and answer this question.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hold my writing utensil with the pads of my fingers and a number of adults have tried to correct me.  I would hold the pencil &quot;the correct way&quot; until out of their site and then go back to holding it my way.  I still occassionally get comments from people when I am writing but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I suppose if it did I could learn how to hold it correctly.  I guess in my long winded sort of way I am trying to tell you that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s neccessary to correct your child on how to hold her pencil.  If the attention bothers her later than I&#39;m sure she will teach herself.  :)  The same also goes for forming the letters.  If it becomes difficult for her to write cursive then I&#39;m sure she will make the adjustments.  I&#39;m not saying that you can&#39;t show her, but if you try to force it on her she will most likely resist.   :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nn up for eLerts at:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/elerts1</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There are 22 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Topics in today&#39;s digest:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      1.

by mary griffith (the author of<br/>\n&gt;two<br/>\n&gt;handbooks for homeschooling and unschooling).  the article was<br/>\n&gt;published in<br/>\n&gt;the mag paths of learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&#39;i discovered three elements common to unschooling families:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;an environment conducive to exploration and experimentation.  to put<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;matter bluntly, we unschoolers have lots of stuff around to play<br/>\n&gt;with.<br/>\n&gt;the nature of that stuff varies with the interests and needs of each<br/>\n&gt;family; from books overflowing their shelves, to pots and pans to<br/>\n&gt;stack and<br/>\n&gt;bang, to backyard garden to cultivate, to a screaming fast computer,<br/>\n&gt;our<br/>\n&gt;homes have lots of easily accessible materials around for children to<br/>\n&gt;investigate.   if we want our kids to learn by following their own<br/>\n&gt;interests, we need to offer them plenty to catch those interests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;adults as models and facilitators.  unschooling parents, like most<br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt;parents, learn rapidly that &quot;do as i say, not as i do&quot; does not work<br/>\n&gt;very<br/>\n&gt;well with children.   unschooling kids need people around them who<br/>\n&gt;provide<br/>\n&gt;models of learning by the way they live and in activities they pursue.<br/>\n&gt; if<br/>\n&gt;we parents are not obviously curious about and interested in the<br/>\n&gt;world<br/>\n&gt;around us, if we ourselves never ask questions and search for answers,<br/>\n&gt;if<br/>\n&gt;we never just try things and see what happens, it&#39;s unlikely that our<br/>\n&gt;kids<br/>\n&gt;will do so, either.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;trust that children will learn.   for most people, this is the big<br/>\n&gt;obstacle<br/>\n&gt;to understanding unschooling and allowing it to work.   perhaps the<br/>\n&gt;conventional school education that created our own model of learning<br/>\n&gt;creates an impression that learning is supposed to be difficult or<br/>\n&gt;boring,<br/>\n&gt;or that learning cannot and will not occur unless someone is<br/>\n&gt;explicitly<br/>\n&gt;teaching, providing information in little age-appro[riate packets,<br/>\n&gt;giving<br/>\n&gt;quizzes on wednesdays and tests on fridays.   eventually, once we&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;bitten<br/>\n&gt;our tongues and sat on our hands and held our breaths long enough to<br/>\n&gt;let<br/>\n&gt;our kids learn to trust their own abilities, we discover that we can<br/>\n&gt;trust<br/>\n&gt;their abilities as well.   in fact, we discover that it&#39;s almost<br/>\n&gt;impossible<br/>\n&gt;to stop our kids from learning, that kids, already intensely curious,<br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;eager to indulge their curiosity.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;she goes on to say:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&#39;of course,  even better than applying manufacturing models of more<br/>\n&gt;recent<br/>\n&gt;vintage than the industrial revolution to education and learning would<br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;to drop the dehumanizing industrial models entirely and start treating<br/>\n&gt;both<br/>\n&gt;children and adult learners as full, active participants in the<br/>\n&gt;educational<br/>\n&gt;process.   in other words, instead of looking at improving<br/>\n&gt;instructional<br/>\n&gt;delivery systems or accountability procedures, shouldn&#39;t we talk<br/>\n&gt;seriously<br/>\n&gt;with our kids about their particular educational paths, learning from<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;how they learn best and what they find helpful or obstructive to<br/>\n&gt;their<br/>\n&gt;learning processes?   aren&#39;t our kids entitled to direct a process<br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt;prepares them for their own future?&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;she concludes by saying:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&#39;however, let me be clear: &quot;because it works&quot; isn&#39;t a sound enough<br/>\n&gt;reason<br/>\n&gt;for me to advocate unschooling in particular and, more generally,<br/>\n&gt;treating<br/>\n&gt;our children as full partners in our lives.   our children are fellow<br/>\n&gt;human<br/>\n&gt;beings - they are our colleagues in the making of the world, in the<br/>\n&gt;creation of our joint future.   treating them as fully human, with<br/>\n&gt;respect<br/>\n&gt;and decency, recognizing them as people just like us, is what we owe<br/>\n&gt;them<br/>\n&gt;and what we owe ourselves.   it&#39;s simply the right thing to do.&#39;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;though this is purely philosophical  i hope it will be of some use to<br/>\n&gt;you.<br/>\n&gt;for me having a strong grasp of the underlining concept helps me work<br/>\n&gt;with<br/>\n&gt;all the many of variables we face each day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-susan<br/>\n&gt;austin,tx<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_________<br/>\n&gt;______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;_________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 5<br/>\n&gt;

My daughter is 8 and when she first became interested, i mean<br/>\n&gt;obsessed :-), i<br/>\n&gt;&gt; became a little concerned.  I don&#39;t want to dictate what she can and<br/>\n&gt;can&#39;t be<br/>\n&gt;&gt; interrested in though; i want her to learn to make her own choices<br/>\n&gt;and not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; rely on someone else to tell her what to do, so i just let it go.  I<br/>\n&gt;found<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that she isn&#39;t into it because it&#39;s cool to be, she really loves<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; characters and the shows.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I have also found some positive aspects to the craze.  One thing,<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;&gt; something that   just about every kid knows something about, and<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s an easy<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ice breaker.  She starts conversations with kids all the time with<br/>\n&gt;pokemon.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I notice they may start with pokemon, but they end up talking about<br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; playing other things after a while.  And at the few burger king<br/>\n&gt;trading<br/>\n&gt;&gt; nights we&#39;ve been to, it all begins with pokemon, but after a while<br/>\n&gt;the kids<br/>\n&gt;&gt; end up in the play area making up new games and just playing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; One of the best &#39;pokemon experiences&#39; i had was when i was with my<br/>\n&gt;daughter<br/>\n&gt;&gt; at the swap meet, and she told the vendor that he was selling a<br/>\n&gt;certain card<br/>\n&gt;&gt; for much less than it was worth.  He looked it up, and sure enough,<br/>\n&gt;she was<br/>\n&gt;&gt; right.  He was very impressed and thanked her for telling him. <br/>\n&gt;Afterwards,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; she said she really wanted the card, and had enough money to buy it<br/>\n&gt;at the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; low price, but she knew that that was the wrong thing to do.  I told<br/>\n&gt;her i<br/>\n&gt;&gt; was proud of her.
