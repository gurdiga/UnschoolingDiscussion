I didn&#39;t intend to<br/>\nsay WEED was what was bad, but was mainly referring to<br/>\nsmoking cigarettes. (And other things that should not<br/>\nbe smoked while with child...or ever really, in my<br/>\nopinion....)<br/>\nBut all the people I&#39;ve known who smoked cigs while<br/>\npregnant or breastfeeding were also smoking weed, so I<br/>\nmentioned it too, as that was what was being asked<br/>\nabout. <br/>\nActually &quot;dope&quot; was the term used, so that covers a<br/>\nmuch broader spectrum for me. <br/>\nI forget that when most people say that they really<br/>\njust mean marijuana. :)<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I get for having people float in and out<br/>\nof my life always that have detailed meanings on<br/>\nseveral different levels of what could be considered<br/>\n&quot;dope&quot; to be smoked. <br/>\nI don&#39;t know about the kids being &quot;slow...&quot; cuz of<br/>\ntheir breastfeeding mom smoking weed. <br/>\nI think it really does depend on the genetics... <br/>\nnot to say that they would genetically be inclined to<br/>\nbe &quot;slow&quot; or something without the weed, but the<br/>\ngenetics of how their mom, family, etc, is affected<br/>\npersonally by smoking weed. <br/>\nExample: I know some people who smoke a hella heap of<br/>\nweed and are not in the least the typical &quot;stoned&quot;<br/>\npicture of a person, with no short term memory<br/>\nwhatsoever. Actually are all the more intelligent and<br/>\nopenminded for it. <br/>\nBut then I know some people who smoke weed and I can&#39;t<br/>\nhandle trying to talk to them cuz it is like a mini<br/>\ngroundhog day episode. The same paragraph of words<br/>\nover and over again. Always as though it&#39;s a new<br/>\nexperience for them. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all about the tolerance, says I.<br/>\nI also think that using rastafarian moms as an example<br/>\nis both good and bad, cuz DUH of course their babies<br/>\nwere scoring high, regardless of weed, diet, race,<br/>\ngenetics, whatever... they were being raised in a very<br/>\nconscious, very loving, open, supportive enviroment. <br/>\nBut unfortunately those are not the people that are<br/>\nusually being referred to when someone talks about<br/>\nsmoking weed. Sadly, alot of the time, it is young<br/>\nmothers (or young at heart anyway), with little or no<br/>\nsupport, who are depressed, or looked down upon for<br/>\none reason or another, who don&#39;t have the education<br/>\n(not &quot;schooling&quot; mind you.) to be able to be those<br/>\nintelligent open minded types, who smoke weed when<br/>\nthey &quot;party&quot; and drink, and have a cig to go along<br/>\nwith it. I think those are the ones that we usually<br/>\nrefer to. I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;yeah she&#39;s a<br/>\ngreat mom, she&#39;s got that whole rastafarian thing goin<br/>\non. great support system. kid&#39;s so open minded and<br/>\nloving. really really smart. too bad she smokes dope<br/>\naround it though, even while she&#39;s breastfeeding. that<br/>\ncan&#39;t be helping.&quot;<br/>\nJust a thought. I&#39;m rambly tonight, people, no one<br/>\ntake me serious enough to be offended, please. <br/>\nWhen I spoke of my ex&#39;s mom and dad I meant they<br/>\nsmoked cigs, CRACK, what have you. <br/>\nGave him whiskey in his bottle instead of milk, etc.<br/>\nSo I wasn&#39;t talking about them smoking weed, I was<br/>\ntalking about &quot;drug use&quot; in general. <br/>\nAnd the study in the book I mentioned was about<br/>\nsmoking tabacco. <br/>\nJust wanted to clear that up. :)<br/>\nI was the one who posted weed as a help for arthritis<br/>\npain. <br/>\nI only think that whatever the substance is, it<br/>\ndepends on how it affects you PERSONALLY and the<br/>\naddictive capacity for you and your potential person<br/>\nin utero. <br/>\nLet&#39;s say some people react badly to orange juice. <br/>\nTo those people I suggest laying off the OJ. ;)<br/>\nI think balance is in order for anything. <br/>\nSometimes too much of a good thing.....<br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lynda &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is no medical evidence to support this theory,<br/>\n&gt; in fact, there have<br/>\n&gt; been several studies to the contrary.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;A study described in Pediatrics 1994; 93:254-260,<br/>\n&gt; (Dreher MC, Nugent K and<br/>\n&gt; Hudgins R) compared the babies of Rastafarian<br/>\n&gt; mothers (smoking up to 5<br/>\n&gt; joints a day) and non-smoking controls.

In other words, there is a genotypic influence on health.  Why some individuals or families seem to secumb to the slightest assault of bacteria, virus, pollen, toxin, etc may have much to do with the cumulative effect generationally.  This does not mean that we are doomed by these genes, as much can be done to alter the phenotypic expression of the genes (a person genotypically destined to high blood pressure, for instance, can, by change of diet and lifestyle, phenotypically express health devoid of high blood pressure).  We can see this healing in the list members who report great success in treating their depression, allergies, or dc&#39;s autism with encouraging and often astounding result.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experiment with Dr. Pottenger&#39;s cats began with healthy cats and altered the diet, with one subset of this group becoming infertile by the fourth generation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, the physician referenced above first asks each patient what their spiritual/religious beliefs are, if any, before treating them.  The mind-body connection portion of the treatment is then tailored in such a way as to obtain optimal result for each individual patient.  What this physician&#39;s individual belief system is, I do not know, but I have benefited from his healing touch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Bobbie","from":"Bobbie &lt;insomniaaks@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"NAthgEgZaP5mWEejmcbQMSLFmMPz3Ljc7i5LlqiqkglKXR8IFTC_vxsr9Kb9_UpTAwTHzpaLtFECu8h5fSy5IvbQhMZL","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] RE.
