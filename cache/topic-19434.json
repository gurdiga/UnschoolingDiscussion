Take a minute to<br/>\nthink about how your girls learn about your religious beliefs... not the<br/>\ndoctrine of the church you belong to (or do not belong to) but rather your<br/>\npersonal take on things?  Before the invention of the modern high school how<br/>\ndid girls learn to cook? keep house?  sew?  run their own side businesses?<br/>\nHow did anyone learn to drive a car? A tractor?   Why on earth would<br/>\nlearning the *facts* of history or science or reading good books need what<br/>\nwe have created?<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning and Teaching have been going on since time began.

Or are you living in a state of fear and guilt,<br/>\nwhere you need to &quot;prove&quot; productivity?  Do you have children that are just<br/>\nlike you, or are they very different?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be an US Army paratrooper. I still roll my socks. &lt;G&gt;  But my<br/>\nability to function in that way doesn&#39;t mesh too well with my children.  I<br/>\nalso had 3 children in 4 years.

Strangely enough, I&#39;m<br/>\nstruggling with returning to my old ways now that the children are older.<br/>\nThere is a way to structure *yourself*, without it bleeding onto the<br/>\nchildren and their education.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best things you can do is to begin or return to a hobby that is<br/>\nall yours.
