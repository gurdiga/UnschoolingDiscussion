However, I can be very stubborn (which is <br/>\nwhere my DD gets it from) and I sometimes think that my way is the <br/>\nonly way.  So, I would like to hear some other view points on this <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would check and see if there is an &quot;open&quot; gym time.  Where you pay a <br/>\ncertain fee and the children come in and have somewhat free run of the activities, <br/>\nnothing is really structured, but there are coaches around to assist and <br/>\nmonitor.  Most gyms have this at least once a week.  It generally isn&#39;t advertised <br/>\nwith the classes because they would like the security of having paid clients in <br/>\nclasses each week.  The open gym is a pay as you come type thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t see &quot;making&quot; her do what the class does.  I also see the point of a <br/>\nclass being just what it is, a class and the teacher wanting some order with a <br/>\ngroup of children.  It is probably pretty distracting to him and the other <br/>\nchildren to have one that goes around doing things as she feels like it.  I&#39;m not <br/>\nsaying that&#39;s bad, just that in the scope of a structured class it&#39;s probably <br/>\nnot going to work.  Think about if your child was one of the ones who was <br/>\ngoing through the routine in the same fashion as the coach and everyone else but <br/>\none child wanted to and did things in her own rhythm and in her own time and <br/>\nsome things not at all... pretty distracting I would think.<br/>\n<br/>\nGymnastics are all about routines anyway.  Certain amounts of time doing this <br/>\nthing or that.  I know at early ages you don&#39;t expect that but it&#39;s being <br/>\nlaid as a foundation.  A BIG reason great gymnastic facilities LOVE <br/>\nhomeschoolers.  Their parents don&#39;t object to sixty hours or more a week in the gym, doing <br/>\nthings the COACHES way.  I also have to add that the gymnasts trust their <br/>\ncoaches because they WANT to be there and do this.  Well, some might not like it <br/>\nas much as their mothers do...<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for the open gym day/night, I think your daughter will love that.  Same <br/>\nequipment same children but they can run from station to station as they <br/>\nplease, that will be great fun with minimal stress.  Oh, and warm ups ARE <br/>\nimportant, not just some routine to begin with.  Stretches muscles and ligaments and <br/>\nwarms them up to avoid injuries when climbing, jumping and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Too much structure?

I look forward to hearing others answers on this dilemma.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how I worked out one with a similar problem but much shorter term.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 16yro and I attended an airbrush body tattoo workshop this past fall which <br/>\nlasted 2 days. After several hours he was quite bored with airbrushing <br/>\nstencils on a tablet (and so was I, LOL). Everyone else seemed quite happy with it. <br/>\nHe started messing around painting what he wanted (on the paper) and I could <br/>\ntell that the wife (it was a husband and wife team who taught this) was not <br/>\nhappy that he was not &quot;doing stencils&quot;. I don&#39;t know if he picked up on her <br/>\ndisapproval or not, he probably did but decided to ignore it. She also made several <br/>\ncomments to me, it was a great moment for me, it was one of the first times <br/>\nin my life (my shift in thinking was already occurring by then) that I let her <br/>\ntalk and went on letting my son do what he wanted. I reasoned that he was <br/>\nright, it was boring and he was not interested in doing stencils or tattoos, he <br/>\nwas not hurting anything or anyone and I had paid for the workshop, $175 each so <br/>\nit was my dime. I wold just laugh when she said something, that was a good <br/>\nday for us both. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143181466,"authorName":"melissa4123","from":"&quot;melissa4123&quot; &lt;melissa4123@...&gt;","profile":"melissa4123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Too much structure?

She has been going to Gymboree since she was 6 <br/>\nmonths old and we thought that she would enjoy the gymnastics.  Both <br/>\nmy husband and myself go to the class with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the part that I would like to get some feedback on.  The <br/>\nclass is much more structured than what she is used to (in gymboree, <br/>\nthe kids can pretty much run around and play on what they want).  In <br/>\nthe new gymnastics class, there is a warm up time and then stations <br/>\nthat they &quot;have&quot; to go and practice on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have only been two classes so far however, after both classes, <br/>\nmy husband and myself have gotten into arguments about what happened <br/>\n(or rather didn&#39;t happen during the class).  Both times, our DD has <br/>\nall but refused to do the warm ups.  The first class, she did most <br/>\nof them and then she didn&#39;t want to so, we did them and hoped that <br/>\nshe would join in (which she didn&#39;t).  As soon as they started with <br/>\nthe stations, she had a great time.  This time, she refused to do <br/>\nany of the warm ups and didn&#39;t want to do some of the stations.  I&#39;m <br/>\nof the opinion that, if she dosen&#39;t want to do the forward rolls but <br/>\ndoes want to walk on the balance beem then let her walk on the <br/>\nbalance beem.  What&#39;s the big deal?  But, my husband wants her to go <br/>\nin order (as does the teacher who was shooting me dirty looks in <br/>\nclass today because I let her go out of order) and says that we <br/>\nshould sit her down and talk to her and tell her that she has to do <br/>\nthe stations in order.  He hasn&#39;t said what, exactly, he&#39;s going to <br/>\ndo when she still refuses (though I did ask him that question) he <br/>\nsays that he will take it on a case by case basis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI simply feel that (keep in mind here that she is very sensitive) as <br/>\nsoon as he takes her aside and starts to tell her that she &quot;has&quot; to <br/>\ndo the warm ups and stations in order that she will feel embarrassed <br/>\nand will know that she has, somehow, disappointed him and will start <br/>\nto cry.  What&#39;s the point in that?  My husband says that she needs <br/>\nto learn structure some time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there is much more to the arguement but I won&#39;t bore you <br/>\nwith an hour&#39;s worth of yelling.  I just feel that there are <br/>\nimportant things to enforce and not important things and this just <br/>\nisn&#39;t that important.  However, I can be very stubborn (which is <br/>\nwhere my DD gets it from) and I sometimes think that my way is the <br/>\nonly way.

And then sometimes, they&#39;ve returned to it when they are older.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids liked participating in group activities (not always classes) - but I always found &quot;teachers&quot; who were willing to let my kids follow their own path...and if they didn&#39;t and my kids were not happy - we dropped out of the activity.  I am always very careful to find out cancellation and refund policy before enrolling.  I can not commit my child to 8 weeks, 16 weeks and sometimes 32 weeks of a program when they&#39;ve never done the activity before.  And if I can&#39;t get a refund I carefully evaluate my budget before enrolling, deciding if we can afford the money if they loose interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once given a full refund by a dance school because I was upfront with the owner about my concerns.  (My dd, 5 at the time - had been asking for ballet, &quot;real ballet&quot; - not the creative movement classes that i hosted. Knowing my dd well, I was not convinced that she wouldn&#39;t be bored)  The schools owner assured me that no one had ever dropped out of her program - and that she has had many homeschoolers in her school.   After three classes, when my dd didn&#39;t want to go anymore as my behavior reflected respect to both dd and owner I received a full refund - even for the classes she had attended &lt;lol&gt;.  A year later, i heard it said that this school &#39;never, ever, ever&#39; gives a refund.  Well - that was not obviously the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...as someone already said...they will learn to stand in line (don&#39;t we do that at the grocery store) and they will learn to respectfully wait their turns (given they are allowed to finish their own turns and not pushed off the swing before they are done) and they will learn to make room on the slide for those that were trained to only go down the slide (not up &lt;omg&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Too much structure?

It sounds like he<br/>\nfelt embarrassed and foolish because she didn&#39;t do<br/>\nwhat the other kids were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe money you pay for a class that she isn&#39;t enjoying<br/>\nis wasted when you could use it to go to the zoo, the<br/>\npark, buy an ice cream cone, and see a movie together.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t have to learn to follow directions and<br/>\nstand in line and take turns by being in a class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake her to the playground, and when it is too cold or<br/>\nrainy, go to the play area in the mall.  Take a walk,<br/>\ntumble in the livingroom.  Have a tea party with all<br/>\nthe stuffed animals, and then play vet when the snacks<br/>\nare gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s just a little wee one still.  She doesn&#39;t need<br/>\nanyone else than her Momma and Papa right now.  She<br/>\nwill learn sharing and taking turns and being kind by<br/>\nplaying with you, and it will come from a desire to<br/>\nsee you smile rather than because someone else told<br/>\nher to share or wait her turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did the same thing with my first born and her little<br/>\nbrother, not knowing any better.  Oh the money we<br/>\ncould have saved on soccer, gymnastics, ballet, tennis<br/>\nlessons, swimming lessons, preschool... sigh... when I<br/>\ncould have just PLAYED with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I haven&#39;t really learned my lessons, either,<br/>\nbecause recently I asked my 5yo if he would like to<br/>\ntake a gymnastics class like his big cousin David<br/>\ndoes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe said to me, &quot;Will I have to do what the teacher<br/>\nsays even if I don&#39;t want to?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Probably.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then I don&#39;t want to.&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time, I listened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n--Susan in VA<br/>\nWifetoVegman<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.

She has been going to Gymboree since she was 6 months old and we","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1644659974\">My DD is 2.5 years old and my DH and I have recently enrolled her in <br/>\na gymnastics class.  She has been going to Gymboree since she was 6 <br/>\nmonths old and we thought that she would enjoy the gymnastics.  Both <br/>\nmy husband and myself go to the class with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the part that I would like to get some feedback on.  The <br/>\nclass is much more structured than what she is used to (in gymboree, <br/>\nthe kids can pretty much run around and play on what they want).  In <br/>\nthe new gymnastics class, there is a warm up time and then stations <br/>\nthat they &quot;have&quot; to go and practice on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have only been two classes so far however, after both classes, <br/>\nmy husband and myself have gotten into arguments about what happened <br/>\n(or rather didn&#39;t happen during the class).  Both times, our DD has <br/>\nall but refused to do the warm ups.  The first class, she did most <br/>\nof them and then she didn&#39;t want to so, we did them and hoped that <br/>\nshe would join in (which she didn&#39;t).  As soon as they started with <br/>\nthe stations, she had a great time.  This time, she refused to do <br/>\nany of the warm ups and didn&#39;t want to do some of the stations.  I&#39;m <br/>\nof the opinion that, if she dosen&#39;t want to do the forward rolls but <br/>\ndoes want to walk on the balance beem then let her walk on the <br/>\nbalance beem.  What&#39;s the big deal?  But, my husband wants her to go <br/>\nin order (as does the teacher who was shooting me dirty looks in <br/>\nclass today because I let her go out of order) and says that we <br/>\nshould sit her down and talk to her and tell her that she has to do <br/>\nthe stations in order.  He hasn&#39;t said what, exactly, he&#39;s going to <br/>\ndo when she still refuses (though I did ask him that question) he <br/>\nsays that he will take it on a case by case basis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI simply feel that (keep in mind here that she is very sensitive) as <br/>\nsoon as he takes her aside and starts to tell her that she &quot;has&quot; to <br/>\ndo the warm ups and stations in order that she will feel embarrassed <br/>\nand will know that she has, somehow, disappointed him and will start <br/>\nto cry.  What&#39;s the point in that?  My husband says that she needs <br/>\nto learn structure some time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there is much more to the arguement but I won&#39;t bore you <br/>\nwith an hour&#39;s worth of yelling.  I just feel that there are <br/>\nimportant things to enforce and not important things and this just <br/>\nisn&#39;t that important.  However, I can be very stubborn (which is <br/>\nwhere my DD gets it from) and I sometimes think that my way is the <br/>\nonly way.  So, I would like to hear some other view points on this <br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89671,"nextTopicId":89981}}
