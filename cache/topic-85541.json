I was starting to get concerned that she wasn&#39;t like others. <br/>\nThanks for the reassurance!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary wrote:<br/>\nIt makes perfect sense to me. I think Joe and I have both gone through this<br/>\nwith Joseph. He&#39;s just not the &quot;typical&quot; boy we rather expected in a very<br/>\nloose kind of way. He doesn&#39;t like to get dirty and he doesn&#39;t especially<br/>\nlike sports. He loves his sports camp one day a week for a few hours, but<br/>\nthat&#39;s as far as it goes. He&#39;s a perfectionist and that means sometimes he<br/>\nwon&#39;t even try something if he thinks he won&#39;t be perfect the first time.<br/>\nHe&#39;s not silly like some kids can be. He&#39;s a lot more serious minded. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t kid with him or joke with him like the other kids. (I&#39;m meaning ours)<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t like surprises. He&#39;s always questioning everything all the time.<br/>\nHe comes up with tough questions. He&#39;s not at all easy going like the girls<br/>\nare. It&#39;s hard sometimes to know what he needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut he&#39;s also very bright and engaging in conversation. He has us look at<br/>\nthings in ways we never have before. He&#39;s honest to a fault. He&#39;s also kind<br/>\nand sensitive. He&#39;s very aware of things around him. Especially little<br/>\nthings. He has a memory to rival none and that comes in handy a lot.<br/>\nEspecially since Joe and I have lost ours lately! He hs an incredible<br/>\nimagination and is so good at making up new games and coming up with<br/>\nwonderful ideas. He plays so well with other kids and is especially kind and<br/>\nsweet with his baby sister. He knows how to speak his mind without hurting<br/>\nfeelings. He&#39;s very comfortable being alone and playing or reading. He&#39;s<br/>\nhelpful to me when I ask and many times even when I don&#39;t. He loves the<br/>\nfamily and he loves this house. He has a wonderul smile. And when you do<br/>\nhear that laugh of his, as infrequent as it comes, it will make you laugh<br/>\nout loud with joy. He&#39;s a great friend and a really cool kid to be around.<br/>\nHe is so much more than we could have hoped for. He&#39;s a wonderful son.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMary B.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Biro<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jaam1224@...\">jaam1224@...</a><br/>\nMemory Keeping at Its Best<br/>\nDon&#39;t your priceless memories and photos deserve<br/>\nmore than a shoe box?
