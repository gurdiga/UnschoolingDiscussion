It is/was a pagan holiday, but it <br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Satan historically. He asked <br/>\nif we dressed up and did trick or treating, and said, yeah, we do <br/>\nboth. We usually go to at least one halloween party, and do trick or <br/>\ntreating at the mall too. He asked about razors in the candy, like it <br/>\nwas something that is really common. I told him that we don&#39;t eat <br/>\nanything that looks suspicious, and that there are places that will <br/>\nxray the candy for you if you want to do that.

We have a real gun in the <br/>\nhouse. If my kids come across a real looking gun, I want them to <br/>\navoid it, come get me, their dad, who ever. I knew someone whose son <br/>\nfound a real gun buried in the stuff under the play equipment at the <br/>\nplayground.(nothing horrible happened, but it was weird and more than <br/>\na little scary because it was partially loaded) It happens rarely, <br/>\nbut it can happen.<br/>\n They will eventually take a gun safety course. Yes,the one the NRA <br/>\ndoes. I&#39;m not a big supporter of the NRA, but that is one thing that <br/>\nthey do very well. They have a pretty comprehensive parent and child <br/>\ngun safety course. Since we will be living in Texas, where guns are <br/>\nvery common, esp in other people&#39;s houses, and we will probably have <br/>\nat least a couple, I want the kids to know what guns can do, and how <br/>\nto handle a weapon safely.<br/>\n But, for now, no real looking guns, because I don&#39;t want them to get <br/>\nconfused about real or fake guns. our real guns look real, their guns <br/>\nare pink, purple, orange and green and look like something out of a <br/>\nbad sci fi movie.<br/>\n The gun daddy uses at work, sometimes, they have seen, up close. <br/>\nthey have held it. It&#39;s a really big real gun that can shoot a whole <br/>\nlot of times. They have actually crawled around on and inside of <br/>\ntanks and seen those really big guns too. (It happens when you live <br/>\non a military base.)They have also asked more than one police officer <br/>\nor MP about their gun or their dog, or their car or their siren. But <br/>\nuntil they are old enough to really distinguish real guns from toy <br/>\nguns, we aren&#39;t going to allow realistic toy guns in the house. I <br/>\nknow several people who come from hunting/ target shooting families, <br/>\nwho have done very similar things with their kids. It just seems to <br/>\nmake sense to me to do it that way. My son is one of those kids who <br/>\nwould make guns out of legos, sticks, breadsticks, or his finger <br/>\nbefore we decided to let this issue go. He&#39;s really okay with the non <br/>\nrealistic guns that we have for him to play with. I don&#39;t like the <br/>\nrepetitive bang bang bang, that usually accompanies gun play. SO, <br/>\nsince most of the kids guns look like ray guns, they make other <br/>\nnoises with them. SO we&#39;re all happy with that.<br/>\nAs far as the video games go, both Marty and I agree, we aren&#39;t going <br/>\nto spend a few hundrend dollars our money on a video game system. <br/>\nWhen the kids are older, and they can find a way to pay for it out of <br/>\ntheir money, so be it. But it&#39;s not something we find really worth <br/>\nit. There are enough computer games out there for our kids to be <br/>\nhappy with for now.

Marty needs a new pair of toy cowboy guns with Halloween coming and <br/>\nall anyway.  Does he want brown or black?  That way you&#39;re totally out of the <br/>\nloop. Don&#39;t even open the package, I&#39;ll address it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I&#39;m going to let him buy it with his money.  That was part of his arguement, that I wouldn&#39;t have to buy it, he has his own money.  He is a saver, so he has plenty.  But, thank you for the offer.  He likes to pick things out and will probably spend a few weeks comparison shopping and choosing just the right one.  That&#39;s part of the fun I think.  He is a discriminating shopper.  <br/>\n  But, thank you, that would of made it easier.  If I&#39;m gonna do this, I&#39;ll just jump on in and let him select his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---They&#39;re just not thinking, your friends.<br/>\n  Do they think that those who do drugs and steal had their mothers&#39; <br/>\n  permission?  That she went to Walmart and bought them some drugs or took them down there <br/>\n  to steal?<br/>\n<br/>\n  good point!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---Being five won&#39;t be repeated either.   Maybe next time he&#39;s where that game <br/>\n  is he&#39;ll feel very differently about it, but keeping him from making a choice <br/>\n  will just add more factors.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One good thing came of that incident.  We talked about what he can do the next time he is in a situation that kids are doing things that makes him uncomfortable but he doesn&#39;t want to speak up because they might not like him.  (handy for later for really big issues I think)  I&#39;m glad we had this chance to talk about peer pressure under a basically benign scenario.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ---And there are rubber band guns made of wood with a clothespin mounted on <br/>\n  them.  Those really can hurt, though.  I&#39;d go for the make-believe &quot;bang&quot; or caps, <br/>\n  not rubber bands.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, he is afraid of rubber bands, when he was younger, he had one over his head and it snapped on both of his eyes and scratched his eyeballs pretty badly.  He will just now touch one, but always retells that story.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I&#39;m moving towards the gun thing, with some guidelines.  I like the don&#39;t point it at anyone who is not playing.  We do have blasters, so we aren&#39;t far away.  The main thing I don&#39;t want him to feel is that he is somehow bad for wanting something I clearly don&#39;t like, kwim?  Would he think &quot;if mom doesn&#39;t like these, they are bad, if I want one, I&#39;m bad for wanting one.&quot;  That would be terrible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The friends I have are noticing that we are really moving in a new direction.  I am so much more relaxed about things, but I&#39;m having a hard time not rolling my eyes at things they are doing and saying.  We were always the most relaxed about things amoung our friends, now especially.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  They were appalled that we taught him to play Magic the Gathering, let him watch Star Wars and Harry Potter movies, and let him eat candy.  They will just have to continue to be appalled.!!  I&#39;ll let ya&#39;ll know how it goes.

It is possible<br/>\nto get tied into knots of non-logic worrying about pretty unlikely scenarios<br/>\nand the opinions of unconnected strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this was my own personal slippery slope. *g*  Initially, I was very <br/>\nanti-gun. Just wasn&#39;t going to happen. I bought the girls those squirt <br/>\nguns that looked like fish instead of guns, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree summers ago, there were these really cool (to my mind)  Buzz <br/>\nLightyear Bubbleguns. I rationalized buying them by thinking to myself, <br/>\n&quot;They&#39;ll never get hurt by picking up a stray ray gun.&quot; or something <br/>\nalong those lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, about a year ago, I began reading more here, and we&#39;d been <br/>\nwatching some of the presidential addresses on the war in Iraq. Emily <br/>\nwas simultaneously making up and singing war protest songs and marching <br/>\naround, singing &quot;Women of War! We are Women of War!&quot;  This list and Em&#39;s <br/>\nown actions made me begin to realize how important it was to honor her <br/>\nneed to play and work through war and violence in her own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen about a month or so later, we were in Colonial Williamsburg and Sam <br/>\nreally wanted a wooden pistol, so we got that. Then it was a Star Wars <br/>\nlight saber, or as the kids say, &quot;light saver.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we started going to Walmart and places looking for swords, shields, <br/>\netc. We now have quite an extensive and wonderful collection of <br/>\ndifferent kinds of swords and a few guns. We just recently picked up a <br/>\npirate&#39;s blunder buster. We picked up a cool Eyewitness book on the <br/>\nhistory of Arms and Armor, and have had great fun all around. Despite <br/>\nthe negative talk about ren fairs here ;) we&#39;re hoping to go to the one <br/>\nhere in Maryland this year and pick up a cool wooden sword and shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had instances where we&#39;ve put the weapon up until Sam (4) was <br/>\nready to be responsible with it: i.e. not hit people or puppies with it. <br/>\nBut I certainly have not noticed *more* violent play in any way. I <br/>\nremember someone here, I think, posting about how violent video games <br/>\nactually gave her son an *outlet* for his aggression that was necessary <br/>\nand far more healthy than repressing those explorations.

We have lots of Nerf weaponry, and I end up <br/>\nhaving my own lame conversations in the toy aisle : &quot;You already have 17 <br/>\nNerf guns and they take up a lot of space -- why do you need another <br/>\none?&quot;   (So I know I&#39;m being an annoying source of friction.)<br/>\n<br/>\nProjectile weapons that you can aim and knock things over with really <br/>\nare fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have to, could you sidle up to toy guns gradually?

But I wanted to tell what I<br/>\nthink is kind of a funny (?) story:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son was probably about 3 and periodically he and I&#39;d go to Toys R<br/>\nUs to play. Sometimes we played with the wagons and trikes on display<br/>\nbut eventually he got caught up in the video games being demo&#39;ed on<br/>\nvarious game consoles in the store. The first game that ever caught<br/>\nhis eye was a game called Tekken (sp?), a kicking and punching<br/>\nfighting game. I was *very* uncomfortable with it. Number one, it<br/>\ndefinitely wasn&#39;t the kind of game *I* enjoyed, it really upset me to<br/>\nwatch punching and kicking and, number 2, I was a little like you: I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to admit that I allowed my kid to play something like<br/>\nthat. Heck, I didn&#39;t even want to admit that I had a kid who *wanted*<br/>\nto play a game like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, first I tried telling Nick that I didn&#39;t want him to play this<br/>\ngame because it was a &quot;violent game and I don&#39;t like watching a game<br/>\nwhere people (characters) get hurt.&quot; I thought maybe my<br/>\ndisapproval/discomfort/dislike would be enough. It wasn&#39;t. So here we<br/>\nare, Nick is sitting in a shopping cart so he can reach the controls<br/>\non the demo game consoles, and a little old lady comes by and says<br/>\nsomething like, &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with our world! Kids playing<br/>\nviolent games like that!&quot; Nick turns to her (actually, I don&#39;t think<br/>\nhe turned - he was too busy), and said, gleefully, &quot;I&#39;ll *like* games<br/>\nwhere people get hurt!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was horrified! But I understood immediately that what he was really<br/>\nsaying was, &quot;I find this fascinating! My mom says this is a game where<br/>\npeople get hurt, ergo, I like games where people get hurt!&quot; My son is<br/>\nalso extremely non-violent. When he was younger, the monsters,<br/>\nenemies, etc., in his video games always turned into nice, cool,<br/>\ngentle, helpful, cute, kind, little creatures in his games of fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided that what was important was how Nick acted and as long as<br/>\nhe continued to be a kind, considerate person, I wasn&#39;t going to think<br/>\nabout controlling what games he played.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the other thing I did, which I know many people would not<br/>\nagree with, was tried to let Nick know about the cultural war around<br/>\ntoy guns and video games. There are some situations where, in<br/>\nconsideration of others, we don&#39;t bring our guns. We don&#39;t bring them<br/>\nto our homeschooling support group Park Day. Nick also knows that when<br/>\nsome moms and their kids come over, we don&#39;t play our Teen and Mature<br/>\nrated video games. In fact, when some moms and kids come over, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t play video games at all. I told Nick what people&#39;s concerns are<br/>\nabout all these things and that what we do in our own home or with<br/>\nlike minded people is one thing but we choose to be concerned about<br/>\nwhat makes our friends uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, maybe this was helpful after all?<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana Tashjian<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Laura Johnson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lauraj2@...\">lauraj2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, how do you get around these issues?

I talked <br/>\nabout it with a few friends, stating how he had such a logical arguement in<br/>\nfavor of.  They were appalled that I would even consider it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes he was considerably more logical than your friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice that I have ever heard regarding toy guns is from Ren. Only<br/>\npoint the gun at someone who has agreed to play the game. That is the<br/>\nprinciple of consideration for others. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is some of what I wrote about toys and violence a little while ago on<br/>\nBasics. There was also thread here called &quot;Violent toys?&quot; a few months ago<br/>\nif you want to look up the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote begins:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be hard to remain open minded when it is a toy gun, because there is<br/>\na pervasive belief in the wider community that playing with guns equates to<br/>\na child becoming a violent person - not unlike playing violent video games.<br/>\nThis is a theory that is not borne out by the experiences related by long<br/>\nterm Unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the wonderful moments from the Conference last year [2003] was when I<br/>\nwas chatting with a mother in the hall (sorry I don&#39;t remember who) when she<br/>\nspotted her dd passing by. She called out to her and politely but excitedly<br/>\nasked if she would mind letting her brother know that some other kids (pre<br/>\nand early teen) were nearby playing some pretend game with long sticks (made<br/>\nfrom pvc pipe) and he would be interested in joining it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis struck me most forcibly as being the exact opposite of how many parents<br/>\nwould react to the whole idea of that kind of game, including assuming the<br/>\nchildren would be careless and dangerous, as well as spiritually/emotionally<br/>\nharmed by the fighting fantasy. They would want it stopped at once. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have faith that the kids were responsible, careful and experienced. I am<br/>\ntotally sure that if there was a kid in the game who seemed to be lacking<br/>\nself-control and dangerous to others, there would be a halt called and they<br/>\nwould seek the help of a familiar adult if the problem could not be<br/>\nresolved. I can only assume that the other mother had equal faith. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, the kids were playing absolutely openly and publicly in<br/>\nthe funshop room (more like a ballroom sized chamber). There was no secrecy<br/>\nor hiding. There was acceptance and encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Here some words from another poster whose dd had a new gun she was<br/>\ndelighting in, and whose expressed ideas were remarkably similar to your ds]<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought is to not take the gun to that other family&#39;s home. On<br/>\nother occasions, especially in your (her) home, it is more important to<br/>\nhonor your daughter&#39;s feelings than the possible feelings of other people,<br/>\nnone of whom you can control. You can continue to observe your dd and take<br/>\ncomfort in her evident grasp of the difference between fantasy play and<br/>\nreality.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, another thing is to give her time for the newness of this toy to<br/>\nwear off before necessarily having a play date with that particular family,<br/>\nso that suggesting different games may be less of a privation for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis issue has come up on occasion on my local group list in relation to<br/>\nPark Days. Rarely, a family is anti-gun on broad principle; others subscribe<br/>\nto the bad-toys-breed-psychos theory (see above); others are concerned about<br/>\nimmediate safety - the kids getting too excited and there being accidents in<br/>\n&quot;violent&quot; play. These are some of the reasons our group tends to look for<br/>\ngood sized parks to allow the kids to separate into different groups for<br/>\ndifferent games. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is sometimes harder for people to deal with very realistic looking guns,<br/>\nrather than colorful &quot;ray guns&quot; or something other weapon like faux swords.<br/>\nOn occasion people have been concerned that other park users will get &quot;the<br/>\nwrong impression&quot; about our kids, especially during war-time. It is possible<br/>\nto get tied into knots of non-logic worrying about pretty unlikely scenarios<br/>\nand the opinions of unconnected strangers. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the responses has been to reassure everyone that although there have<br/>\nbeen the odd accidents at park days, none have been related to fantasy<br/>\nweapons role playing. Another has been to talk about the kids&#39; needs to<br/>\nprocess some of their fears and feelings about the war news, or societal<br/>\nviolence in general, to feel powerful in a safe environment with the surety<br/>\nof their parents available to step in if it all got too much at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are ideas that have been expressed by some of the parents of mostly<br/>\nboys in our group who continue to engage in gun or weapons games. Jayn has<br/>\nto date shown no interest in these games at the park. She does enjoy playing<br/>\n&quot;On guard&quot; with us at home with her swords and shields - lots of collapsing<br/>\n&quot;dead&quot; cured with the following incantation, &quot;magic, magic back alive!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nGun playing doesn&#39;t bother me. A child getting upset enough to use any toy<br/>\nor object as an actual weapon, as against a fantasy weapon, is much more<br/>\nworrying. Sand is more dangerous at the park than one kid&#39;s habitual bow and<br/>\nsuction cup arrows have ever been.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;m glad nobody is standing over me telling me, &quot;That will <br/>\ngive you a tummy ache.&quot; Even my family and friends who KNOW it will, at <br/>\nleast understand that sometimes I just want to eat it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] getting there but some holdout issues","postDate":"1096561262","msgId":100026,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlkLjRmNTE4OTdhLjJlOGQ4YzZlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100024,"nextInTopic":100027,"prevInTime":100025,"nextInTime":100027,"topicId":100024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/30/04 10:02:51 AM, lauraj2@verizon.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2033262410\">In a message dated 9/30/04 10:02:51 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lauraj2@...\">lauraj2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So, basically, I feel bad about it, but am still resistant.

Last night, ds ate half of a bag of Hershey&#39;s Kisses, two bites of dinner and then asked for an ice cream.  Dh looked at me like I was nuts for getting it.  DS had a little stomach ache later and said that maybe it was the ice cream.  He didn&#39;t each much protein, but had some fruit.  We were never overly restrictive about anything especially food.  But, we would try to encourage dinner before sweets.  So, that is new.  As I was making the grocery list, Ben wasn&#39;t going with me, I made sure to ask him if he wanted anything.  He said &quot;more kisses!!&quot;.  It occurred to me that in most homes, no one would probably bother to ask the 5 year old what he wanted and be willing to buy it without hesitation.  I usually don&#39;t ask him because he is usually with me when we shop and I buy pretty much what he wants, though now I make sure to ask, and I never say no to something unless we just don&#39;t have the extra money for 3 types of cereal or whatever.  He didn&#39;t eat anymore kisses by the way, even when I brought the bag out and offered them.<br/>\n<br/>\n We&#39;ve never had bedtimes and only made a mild attempt once to regulate tv.  So many families I know restrict the tv, well everyone I know does.  As well as food and lots of other things.  We&#39;ve always been pretty relaxed about most things.  Not issues one way or another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one issue that I&#39;m having a hard time letting go of if is the issue of toy guns.  I don&#39;t know why, but they bug me and we believed for so long that how kids shouldn&#39;t play with them, they promote violence, desensitizing them to violence etc...  Though we&#39;ve also talked about how I had toy guns as a kid, cap guns, and I&#39;m not violent.  DH always wanted a toy gun and never got one and resented it(lived  in a school bus as a kid by hippie parents, totally natural sugar free diet, earthy crunchy, now craves sugar and hates health foods also, not a violent person).  Most of our friend&#39;s kids would never have toy guns or any weapon toys.  We do have light sabers, swords and squirt guns.  Now, ds wants a toy gun and has been telling me that he is going to buy his kids a toy gun when he grows up. Here is our latest conversation:<br/>\n<br/>\n B: I really want a toy gun.<br/>\nM. I know, I really don&#39;t want you to have one.<br/>\nB: Why not?<br/>\nM: Because I don&#39;t like toy guns (totally weak reason I know)<br/>\nB: then I won&#39;t ask you toy play with it.<br/>\nM: Guns hurt people, I don&#39;t like when kids pretend to hurt people<br/>\nB: But, toy guns aren&#39;t real, and no one gets hurt.  I have swords and they hurt people for real, but toy ones don&#39;t they are just pretend, you know the difference right Mommy? (this kid is 5 btw)<br/>\nM: I just don&#39;t like them<br/>\nB: Then when you come in the room, I&#39;ll hide it (uh oh, this is not good)<br/>\nM: I don&#39;t want you to hide things from me<br/>\nB: But, I dont&#39; want you to feel sad about a gun.  I won&#39;t shoot you with it I promise.<br/>\nM: Let me talk it over with Daddy and think about it<br/>\nB: okay let me know  (ick, another bad feeling from this response)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, I feel bad about it, but am still resistant.  I talked about it with a few friends, stating how he had such a logical arguement in favor of.  They were appalled that I would even consider it.  I know it will not make him violent, he is a gentle kid, loud and roaring but gentle with other kids, not aggressive at all.  He loves knights, and robot battles, but I&#39;ve noticed that when he make his little robots from legos and they battle, after they &quot;get fainted&quot;, they join the good guy side.  And the good guys don&#39;t get hurt.  So, even in his play, he is not violent.  They said, &quot;so you pretty much are going to let him do whatever he wants whether it is good for him or not.  What if he wants to do drugs or steal, is that okay becasue he should have the freedom to choose for himself?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still resistant.  Part of it I hate to admit, is the perception of I bought my kid a toy gun.  Weak and poor reason, but I&#39;m being honest with myself, and I don&#39;t like my reasons.  Dh says he&#39;s fine with it. either way.  His hold out issue is soda.  He doesn&#39;t want him to have any.  Candy, beef jerky yes, soda no.???  DS never asks for it so it isn&#39;t an issue right now.  I&#39;m fine with soda.  We drink it.  But, dh doesn&#39;t want him to have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you all have any hold out issues?  Things that go against your grain to just let go of?  I&#39;m trying hard to get through this gun thing, because he wants one.  I dont&#39; know why it bothers me so much.  I&#39;ve had some family members killed by guns, two in law enforcement, one by suicide, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the issue for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do you get around these issues?  Violent video games, shows and toys, if you just don&#39;t want it around and you are worried about the effects of things on your kids?  He played some pretty violent video games at a friend&#39;s house. I think one was Mortal Kombat, again, he&#39;s five, I dont&#39; think he was ready for something like this.  He talked about it for months afterwards.  He incorporated it into his play and talked about it constantly.  It disturbed him a great deal and he didn&#39;t like it.  But, the kids were older and he didn&#39;t know what to do.  It was an emergency babysitting situation, and won&#39;t be repeated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting too long so I won&#39;t go on.  We are on the continuim, but I don&#39;t know how to get through this part.<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100191,"nextTopicId":100321}}
