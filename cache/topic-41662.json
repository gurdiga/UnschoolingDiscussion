How was the conference you attended/presented at? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If I tell too many stories it will seem unbelievably puffed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I had fun.  I met people whose words I had read for years but whose faces and <br/>\n  voices and smiles were new to me.  I got to hang around with people I know <br/>\n  and REALLY like but who are only physically in my life at homeschooling <br/>\n  conferences!<br/>\n<br/>\n  There were four speaking-times for me, and three were shared with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Saturday there was an unschooling panel which ended up being Mary Griffith, <br/>\n  Jan Hunt, Pam Sorooshian, myself, and Evan Wright, a young man who came late <br/>\n  to unschooling but REALLY got it and had his life changed.  He was profoundly <br/>\n  moving.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sunday morning at 8:00 (yes, church-early and pretty extreme) was my only <br/>\n  alone-presentation.  I had about 60 people, I think.  I haven&#39;t listened to <br/>\n  the tape yet so I haven&#39;t even reviewed for myself how I think it went.  It <br/>\n  was smooth, but I think a couple of times I started to make a point and <br/>\n  didn&#39;t quite dwell on it long enough to finish clearly.  I hope it all made <br/>\n  an hour&#39;s worth of sense though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  9:15 Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I went together to do a presentation on video <br/>\n  games.  I&#39;m going to lift what I wrote to the HSC list about that rather than <br/>\n  try to re-phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was forwarded a very nice set of comments on the video gaming workshop that <br/>\n  Dan Vilter, Kathy Ward and I collaborated on (thanks, Nicole, for writing <br/>\n  that, and thanks Betsy for sending it to me!) and I have some things to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dan was awesome, both in terms of the information he had (which wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\n  sounded the same coming from me or Kathy, honestly) AND his technical pizazz <br/>\n  (which was really on the low end of his pizazz capability, I&#39;m sure).  <br/>\n  Kathy&#39;s testimony was more powerful than mine because she went from limiting <br/>\n  video games to revelling in them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  One especially sweet aspect which we hadn&#39;t planned in advance was this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  We had three &quot;demo&quot; offspring each play a game.  My Holly, Dan&#39;s Matthew, and <br/>\n  Kathy&#39;s Jonathan.   With those three, they were in three different age <br/>\n  ranges, and not all boys.  That was exceptionally well balanced, considering <br/>\n  it was put together piecemeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We were in a small room, and it packed up, with people sitting on the floor, <br/>\n  leaning on the walls and the back table, and watching from the sidewalk <br/>\n  outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I propose to anyone concerned with next year&#39;s conference that<br/>\n  1) it was important<br/>\n  2) it was popular and desired information<br/>\n  3) we need a WAY bigger room<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think Dan Vilter should do this again in the ballroom/banquet room where he <br/>\n  can project the game screen even bigger and better, and where as many people <br/>\n  as want to can get in there and watch normal unschooled gaming kids play <br/>\n  difficult games with ease, and describe the strategies they&#39;re using.   If <br/>\n  Dan wants help and I&#39;m invited out again, I&#39;d love to be just a helper this <br/>\n  time.  I bet Kathy would do it again too.   The energy in the room was great. <br/>\n  I felt that we really changed some minds and some families&#39; lives.  Those <br/>\n  already of a mind to accept video games as valuable had their vague ideas <br/>\n  solidified.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We could have done a full day of presentation with no repetition.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m still excited about that workshop.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra Dodd<br/>\n  ---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I&#39;ll put Nicole&#39;s notes, and then come back to the rest of that day:<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Did anyone go to the talk about <br/>\n  &gt; videogames?  have any details to share? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes, I went to this panel and thought it was one of the best subjects i<br/>\n  could <br/>\n  have picked that weekend on my sons behalf (after all its all about<br/>\n  them) I <br/>\n  only wished I had taken him to it (He just turned 12) I was so thrilled<br/>\n  about <br/>\n  the talk i didn&#39;t want to leave, I felt like i was doing the best thing<br/>\n  for <br/>\n  my son even though he wasn&#39;t there, I could now understand his side of<br/>\n  the <br/>\n  importance of video games and computer games and how they DO STIMULATE<br/>\n  YOUR <br/>\n  MIND, it just sorta reaffirmed what I had already hope could be. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think it would be great if every parent could hear it next year,<br/>\n  because <br/>\n  almost all of us do have a child who likes to play a computer game or<br/>\n  video <br/>\n  game and have it be held in one of the bigger rooms too! Oh I also<br/>\n  bought the <br/>\n  tape on it so my husband (who was watching my three children) could<br/>\n  listen to <br/>\n  it, so if you cant get it I can make a copy for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for the great question and thank you Kathy, Sandra, and Dan for<br/>\n  such a <br/>\n  cool topic and to all Conference volunteers and workers for making it <br/>\n  possible :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Nicole**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

The energy in the room was great. <br/>\n I felt that we really changed some minds and some families&#39; lives.  Those <br/>\nalready of a mind to accept video games as valuable had their vague ideas <br/>\nsolidified.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have done a full day of presentation with no repetition.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still excited about that workshop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll put Nicole&#39;s notes, and then come back to the rest of that day:<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did anyone go to the talk about <br/>\n&gt; videogames?  have any details to share? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I went to this panel and thought it was one of the best subjects i<br/>\ncould <br/>\nhave picked that weekend on my sons behalf (after all its all about<br/>\nthem) I <br/>\nonly wished I had taken him to it (He just turned 12) I was so thrilled<br/>\nabout <br/>\nthe talk i didn&#39;t want to leave, I felt like i was doing the best thing<br/>\nfor <br/>\nmy son even though he wasn&#39;t there, I could now understand his side of<br/>\nthe <br/>\nimportance of video games and computer games and how they DO STIMULATE<br/>\nYOUR <br/>\nMIND, it just sorta reaffirmed what I had already hope could be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be great if every parent could hear it next year,<br/>\nbecause <br/>\nalmost all of us do have a child who likes to play a computer game or<br/>\nvideo <br/>\ngame and have it be held in one of the bigger rooms too! Oh I also<br/>\nbought the <br/>\ntape on it so my husband (who was watching my three children) could<br/>\nlisten to <br/>\nit, so if you cant get it I can make a copy for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the great question and thank you Kathy, Sandra, and Dan for<br/>\nsuch a <br/>\ncool topic and to all Conference volunteers and workers for making it <br/>\npossible :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNicole**</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41693,"nextTopicId":41682}}
