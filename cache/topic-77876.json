He then *got* these little bits. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that unschooling is the only way this son can really get into science, on his own schedule. One of his older brothers is into manga and gaming and does the same amount of reading for his interests.

I&#39;m Aimee, live in Chicago, IL, with one son, Alex, <br/>\n9. I&#39;ll be in your neck of the woods tomorrow, and all next week!  Oh <br/>\nCanada.... <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This year for grade 9 we bought Apologia Biology. He is <br/>\nreally having a struggle with it. He is an excellent reader, but is <br/>\nhaving a hard time remembering what the definitions mean and what <br/>\nthings like an autotroph, etc. is. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       I&#39;m not familiar with that.  But is he reading from interest, or is he <br/>\nreading Chapters 1-3 type thing?  I find that my son recalls just fine when <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested, but when he pressures himself to finish or read a certain <br/>\nthing, he just has no retention.  I ask him questions and I get a lot of shrugs <br/>\nand &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;  We talk about how just reading thru something will give <br/>\nyou a general idea about something, and if that&#39;s all he wants, that&#39;s all we <br/>\ndo, and that&#39;s fine.  And later on, we know where to look something up, at <br/>\nleast! <br/>\n<br/>\n       So, instead, we follow his interests, we read together, stop a lot, <br/>\nask each other questions, look stuff up online, and we really explore and get <br/>\ninto it.  That makes a major difference.  Context.  And we don&#39;t move on until <br/>\nwe&#39;ve exhausted the subject or he gets &quot;soaked&quot; with it and wants to move on.  <br/>\nBut this doesn&#39;t happen with everything. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I am worried about for him is math&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>       What worries do you have?  I would ask what the math is for? Again, <br/>\ncontext.  I really think that if he delved into other subjects and found a use <br/>\nfor math, a personalized context for learning math,  that he would learn all <br/>\nthe skills he needs.  But I think if you&#39;re having the worry that he might need <br/>\nit someday,  I would say try to become more comfortable with waiting for that <br/>\nday, and trusting that he will learn it then.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Can he explore his interests in high school as well as public school? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       If you&#39;re asking if you can unschool high school, the simple answer is <br/>\nyes.  I don&#39;t think that kids can explore their interests very much at all in <br/>\npublic school, so I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re saying exactly. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I really don&#39;t care about the rest. Is this <br/>\nthe wrong attitude?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n       For unschooling, I would say, yes. What does he care about?  Does he <br/>\nhave a strong natural interest in math and science?  Lots of people unschool, <br/>\nexcept for math, or except for something else, and altho I don&#39;t think that&#39;s <br/>\nunschooling, I understand the worry that parents have.   I think the worry is <br/>\nunfounded on one hand, and understandable on another.  But, to be clear, I <br/>\nthink that if you require your child to learn things he might never need, and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to learn, that&#39;s not unschooling.  I honestly think that adds <br/>\npressure and expectations that get in the way of learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n       I don&#39;t know what else to say but that his interests *will* lead him <br/>\nto the things he needs, that calculus or algebra CAN be learned unschooling. <br/>\nThere&#39;s no reason why it can&#39;t.   For example, if he becomes interested in <br/>\nPhysics, and he find he needs Algebra, he&#39;ll learn it to help him understand <br/>\nPhysics.  I like that example because I failed Algebra twice in HS, but got straight <br/>\nA&#39;s in Physics, all I needed was context to help me understand it.<br/>\n       <br/>\n       When I first started unschooling, I was concerned about high school, <br/>\nand actually told people I would probably send him.  Now, I am much more <br/>\nrelaxed and hopeful about it.  I hope that continuing to trust his process will lead <br/>\nhim naturally to explore his interests and abilities, and I hope not to have <br/>\nany more expectations for him at high school age than I do now, altho I still <br/>\nstuggle with it a bit.  What is it about high school that makes me anxious, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know, it didn&#39;t prepare me very well for college or life!! <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;Thanks for any help you can give to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI gave you what I&#39;ve got, I don&#39;t know what help it was!!  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Aimee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77834,"nextTopicId":77893}}
