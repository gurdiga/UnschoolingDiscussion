Even","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-14400011\">Ned,<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that you meant your original remark as a joke, but it&#39;s a kind <br/>\nof a pet peeve.  Everyone assumes that you will send your child to school! <br/>\n Even though people have called her a pre-schooler and I have not verbally <br/>\nobjected every time, it still bugs me.  However, as I said earlier, she <br/>\nhas taken to correcting people for me (&quot;I&#39;m going to homeschool!&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what I do different, it is mostly a case what I do NOT do.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nassume that she needs my intervention to figure out how to do things, so I <br/>\ntry to stay out of her way and let her work though things on her own. <br/>\nAlso, I try not to make patronizing comments (&quot;You&#39;re so smart to be able <br/>\nto do X&quot;).  I want her to think that it is natural to be able to do <br/>\nwhatever it is she can do.  Also, I used to answer her questions with <br/>\nquestions (&quot;What do you think it spells?&quot;). After thinking about it, I <br/>\nrealized how much it annoys me when people answer my questions like that, <br/>\nso I&#39;ve just started to answer her questions, regardless of how basic they <br/>\nare, and how much I think she may already know the answer.  Altogether, I <br/>\nwould say that it is a case of respecting her intelligence and not <br/>\ntreating her as a &quot;child&quot; (where &quot;child&quot; is used a pejorative), but rather <br/>\nas an human who doesn&#39;t happen to have the experience that I have, but is <br/>\nfully capable of understanding/reasoning on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLuz Shosie and Ned Vare &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nedvare@...\">nedvare@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n08/13/2002 01:12 PM<br/>\nPlease respond to Unschooling-dotcom<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n        To:     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n        cc: <br/>\n        Subject:        [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:  2235 Pre-unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 8/12/02 6:50 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin Tucker wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a 3yo daughter, and although she would be considered a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;preschooler&quot; in the world at large, I consider that she is already an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler, not a &quot;pre-unschooler&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right Tuck.
