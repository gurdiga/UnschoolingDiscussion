I have found that  I do need to look and listen to see what the frustration is  and  how to respond. This would never eliminate my enthusiastic  real response  to  what they show me. It could often lead me to see that just that response-genuine tho it is- may not be addressing  the frustration issues. It could be-&quot;could you use  more &quot;beads&quot; for that-as Sandra wrote-  it could be &quot;what part would you like to change&quot; for a 4 year old -it could be -would you like me to cut out the sun and all the rays while you color  the rainbow&quot; it often is wow that will go so well  on our fish wall-could I put it up there with them. I have found that more might be needed from me in the face of their frustration  than just my genuine  comments of enjoyment that I would give- say-to some of my art quilter friends-unless they have &quot;left room in the conversation&quot; for comments on particulars.<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n  However, I <br/>\nhave a four-year-old son who does not seem to enjoy artwork because he can&#39;t <br/>\ndraw so that it looks &quot;real,&quot; or &quot;like Daddy&#39;s.&quot;  (His father is an artist.) <br/>\n  He generally gets very frustrated with anything he does and says things <br/>\nlike, &quot;I just can&#39;t do it right!&quot;  I always made a point from the beginning <br/>\nnot to gush over art pieces that he does, but perhaps just notice a certain <br/>\ncolor he used, for example, I do say things like, &quot;That is interesting,&quot; or, <br/>\n&quot;That has a lot of lines.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a long story short, in the past six months or so I have explained to <br/>\nhim that art isn&#39;t supposed to &quot;look right,&quot; and that it is about just doing <br/>\nwhat we want to do and it is also about how we feel.  I also started to get <br/>\nexcited when he would even make an attempt at art, saying more praise-type <br/>\nthings like, &quot;Wow!  That&#39;s really neat!&quot;  It seemed that after I started to <br/>\n&quot;praise&quot; him more, he would get excited about his art and do more and not be <br/>\nso worried about it looking &quot;right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, should I just be really mellow about the whole thing, or <br/>\nis there a time when small amounts of praise are helpful?  Or am I just <br/>\nsetting up my son to feel like his art has to be &quot;neat&quot; for me?  I really <br/>\nfeel bad when he gets so frustrated, and want him to be able to know that <br/>\nhis art IS appreciated, even if he doesn&#39;t think it is worthy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89823,"nextTopicId":89864}}
