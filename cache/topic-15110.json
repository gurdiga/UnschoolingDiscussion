Not all kids need 8 hours of sleep, and if you&#39;re expecting MORE than <br/>\n8 hours (he has a bedtime), he will wake up when he&#39;s had enough sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you let him stay up as late as he wants playing video games in his <br/>\nroom or reading then he&#39;ll sleep through from the time he goes to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t sleep much and neither does our oldest son.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15109,"nextTopicId":15039}}
