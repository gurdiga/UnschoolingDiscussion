You can expose them <br/>\nto more examples and you can provide them with<br/>\nmaterials/ideas/experiences <br/>\nvery inexpensively at home&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with this. My seven year old was<br/>\ndrumming on everything, begging for a drumset. We<br/>\nagonized over how to come up with the $ to get him a<br/>\nset for xmass, finally deciding on Bongos as a<br/>\nstarter---- sort of a test to see whether or not it<br/>\nwas a phase or he was really into percussion. Well, it<br/>\nseems we cured him of any interest in drums! Since<br/>\nxmass, he hasnt drummed on anything, including the<br/>\nbongos. Boy, am I glad we didnt spend hundreds of $ on<br/>\na drumset.<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying your son wont play the piano if you get<br/>\none, but we really thought Jay was going to be a<br/>\nfabulous drummer, and now we know better. He may still<br/>\nplay drums, after all - he&#39;s only 7 1/2, but I dont<br/>\nthink a drumset was the deciding factor for his talent<br/>\nor ambition.<br/>\n:)Kerry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14987,"nextTopicId":14995}}
