Plus she has to pack up stuff to take with her when you take <br/>\nher with you to work. She had low self-esteem - which is why you took <br/>\nher out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - she&#39;s an extreme night owl, probably partly vision-related <br/>\nreasons and, it sounds like, just because that is her personal nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nPLEASE listen to this:  start summer vacation right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpend the &quot;summer&quot; (meaning from now until September) just having fun <br/>\ntogether. Don&#39;t try to get her to learn anything at all. (I&#39;d like to <br/>\nsay, &quot;Try to stop her,&quot; but I won&#39;t go quite that far &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, don&#39;t take any action or say anything to her that is <br/>\ndesigned to get her to learn anything. Instead of finding articles or <br/>\nvideos that you think &quot;should&quot; interest her, just get movies that you <br/>\nknow she&#39;ll enjoy. (Have you seen &quot;Spirited Away?&quot; or &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery <br/>\nService?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re not seeing clearly yet - YOU haven&#39;t got your own vision cleared <br/>\nregarding learning versus schooling. There is a certain amount of <br/>\nfaith/trust that you have to have to &quot;get it&quot; and you&#39;re agitated and <br/>\nbusy and worrying yourself too much - you have to relax and let your <br/>\nvision clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you could let go of all preconceived notions about what learning <br/>\nlooks like, I think you&#39;d be pretty darn impressed with your daughter. <br/>\nShe sounds wonderful to me.  It is YOU who could do a way better job of <br/>\nfacilitating her learning - you&#39;re not supporting her, you&#39;re still <br/>\ntrying to shape her to fit into a mold that you have in YOUR head. <br/>\nYou&#39;re discounting HER interests and not supporting her strengths and <br/>\nher very individual, unique self.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she read what you&#39;ve written to us, would you be embarrassed at all? <br/>\nWould what you&#39;ve written to us be good for HER self esteem?<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine you were writing it about me - a 53 yo woman friend. I would be <br/>\nterribly insulted that you thought what I chose to do with my time <br/>\nwasn&#39;t good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really seriously think you should stop it. Stop agitating yourself <br/>\nover this and focus on learning something yourself ABOUT learning. Read <br/>\n&quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; by Frank Smith. Read &quot;The <br/>\nUnprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter. Read &quot;The Unschooler&#39;s <br/>\nHandbook&quot; by Mary Griffith. Read &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt. <br/>\nLast, but definitely not least, read as much as you can on <br/>\n&lt;SandraDodd.com&gt;, particularly those articles written by Sandra, <br/>\nherself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have great instincts - you lack confidence. Bolster yourself by <br/>\neducating yourself. In the meantime, just enjoy time with your 12 yo - <br/>\ntrust me please - I have 3 daughters, 14, 17, and 20. Twelve is a VERY <br/>\nspecial age - poised at the edge of womanhood. Don&#39;t miss out on the <br/>\njoy of it by creating an adversarial relationship at all. Don&#39;t fight <br/>\nher - support her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 21, 2005, at 8:47 PM, greencow32766 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions????

I <br/>\nhave really backed off my daughter.  She has shown me a few times <br/>\nalready that if she&#39;s interested in something she&#39;ll put 100% into it <br/>\nand enjoy it.  I&#39;ve decided (with her approval) that I will cut out <br/>\nany articles out of the paper that might interest her, let her know <br/>\nof upcoming shows on the History channel etc... that might interest <br/>\nher that we could record and I let her &quot;pack her own backpack of <br/>\nthings to do&quot; when she goes to work with me at my parents (her <br/>\ngrandparents).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...this is what the past two weeks have been like:  I have a small <br/>\nstack of newspaper articles that she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest in <br/>\nyet, I&#39;ve recorded probably 8 shows she said she be interested in but <br/>\nhasn&#39;t wanted to watch them yet, she decided she&#39;d like to work more <br/>\non girl scout stuff so I got that all figured out and helped her get <br/>\nstarted and she hasn&#39;t done anything else with it.. All she is doing <br/>\nis staying up late playing a &quot;medieval&quot; type role playing games on <br/>\nthe computer, sleeping in late, getting up just in time for chorus at <br/>\nschool at 2pm, home and back on the computer, I will give her major <br/>\ncredit for one thing - she&#39;s actually reading for pleasure - BIG <br/>\nACHIEVMENT!!!!  I&#39;m so proud of her.  But that&#39;s it - computer games, <br/>\nreading, sleeping & chorus.... She is really really into the <br/>\ncomputer, she says she&#39;d love to think about getting into some kind <br/>\nof field relating to computer security so I try to look at her 7 <br/>\nhours a day on the computer as &quot;okay&quot;, I am proud of the reading but <br/>\nshe&#39;s not giving herself any time to become interested in anything <br/>\nelse.  Just being exposed to life is teaching her a lot too I think, <br/>\nshe&#39;s around an uncle that is recovering from prescription drug <br/>\nabuse, a great grandmother with heart problems that are discussed on <br/>\na daily basis, being involved and helping in a small family run a/c <br/>\nbusiness etc..... but I still worry!  Sometimes I think I should <br/>\nreally limit the computer time but being on the computer has been her <br/>\npassion for going on a year now....<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions???? Is what I&#39;ve described unschooling?  I do I know <br/>\nshe&#39;ll ever want to do anything else????
