But<br/>\nschooling someone is NOT a good way for learning to unfold. School is<br/>\nwhat you took her out of, why are you bringing it into your home?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t need to pay attention to stuff that doesn&#39;t interest her.<br/>\nIf the learner isn&#39;t seeing a reason to learn it, or finding something<br/>\nfascinating, they won&#39;t learn.  She can jump through the hoops to<br/>\nappease you, but that&#39;s not learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretend like you&#39;ve been given the gift of summer vacation starting<br/>\ntoday.  What would you do if school never existed? What kind of fun<br/>\nthings would you plan with her if you had no agenda or goals to meet?<br/>\nWhat if today is about connecting and playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that environment, true learning can begin to unfold.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112129,"nextTopicId":112091}}
