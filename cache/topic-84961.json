Sounds similar to Alaska.....<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about Florida averages, Mary B. lives in a higher expense area than we do, but here in the NW of Florida a $200,000 home is very upper end. We payed $64,000 for ours and that is fairly common. Most homes in the average middle income type neighborhoods are between 80 to 120 thousand.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84791,"nextTopicId":84963}}
