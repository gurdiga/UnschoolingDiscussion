We had a three day trial last <br/>\nweek and it was a great success. 12 kids and various parents and <br/>\n&#39;teachers&#39;. What was interesting was the time when one of the kids said <br/>\nthey hated the meetings and wanted everyone to just say their piece. One <br/>\nof the adults pointed out about how then only the people who are more <br/>\nassertive get heard, and the quiet ones will naturally tend to not speak <br/>\nup. The democratic process allowed even the 4 year olds with the shyest <br/>\npersonalitys get their voice out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was amazing to see how some of the little ones or very shy ones were <br/>\nso involved by the 2nd day and they were out their with their ideas by <br/>\nthe 3rd.
