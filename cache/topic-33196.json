They can leave and go BACK to unschooling, but even if they are<br/>\n  &gt;there for band or football, they still have rules, requirements and<br/>\n  &gt;expectations that are the antithesis of unschooling. Zachary went back to<br/>\n  &gt;school for whatever reasons. He is not CURRENTLY unschooling, but he could<br/>\n  &gt;if he left school.<br/>\n  &gt;~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  About three hours drive from here is the Albany Free School. Its a <br/>\n  wonderful place where kids of all ages mix together. There is no <br/>\n  cirriculum. There are no classes unless a kid wants to learn something <br/>\n  specific.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There are rules. One can&#39;t hit another kid without it going to a meeting <br/>\n  on the consequences. One is not allowed to destroy another&#39;s creation, <br/>\n  etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n  They are in all rights of New York State, a school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The children there are prolly unschooled more than a good portions of <br/>\n  children who stay at home to do the exact same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Its whose AGENDA is being followed that determines the name of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
