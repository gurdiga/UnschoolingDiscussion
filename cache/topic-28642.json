I say<br/>\nexamine yourself thoroughly....where is this need coming from?  Often,  I<br/>\nthink parents efforts at *encouraging* are a thinly veiled attempt to direct<br/>\nthem to what the parent thinks is necessary.  I think pushing,  even subtly,<br/>\nwill drive most children away from the very topics you think they &quot;need to<br/>\nbe taught&quot;   Why can you believe in them learning some things on their own<br/>\nand in their own good time,  but not others?  Isn&#39;t it because their natural<br/>\ninterest and intrinsic motivation drive them to excel at what they&#39;re<br/>\ninterested in?  Do you think your child will never want to write?  Does it<br/>\nmatter to the child or to you whether &quot;creative writing&quot; is learned?<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n(Does creative writing include my 4 yo dd taking the box of 300 Q-tips and<br/>\nforming them into a reasonable facsimie of her name dozens of time over the<br/>\nwhole floor?)<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraging journal writing may be something you could look into. For the<br/>\nyounger kids, Borders has a book called Scraps & Scribbles which is a great<br/>\nstarting point. They offer suggestions of things to write about (past<br/>\nbirthday parties, vacations, favorite relatives, oneself, etc.), and the<br/>\nbook gives plenty of doodle space to get one going.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend used a writing program***for her older children when they were<br/>\nready to go to college and yet hadn&#39;t ever written any essays or term<br/>\npapers.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.writeguide.com/\">http://www.writeguide.com/</a><br/>\nThey were very pleased with the program and the motivation it offered her<br/>\nteen. You get to choose what type of writing you want to do and have a lot<br/>\nof freedom of choices with their set up.<br/>\n***Before it&#39;s pointed out that this is an unschooling list, I know that but<br/>\nI&#39;m of the belief that unschooling can encompass books of all kinds,<br/>\ninstruction from others can include what would normally be considered<br/>\n&quot;schoolish&quot; *if* the child was the one asking to do &quot;it&quot;. To *me*,<br/>\nunschooling means that the person doing the learning is doing so of their<br/>\nown free will and not being coerced into it.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\nps..
