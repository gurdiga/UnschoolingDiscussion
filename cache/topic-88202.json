I am very new to this theory and I just<br/>\nneed it clarified I guess. I am not even sure at this point this is how<br/>\nI want to raise my kids. I read post after post about how you let your<br/>\nkids choose what they want, when they want...I try to go with a very AP<br/>\nminded philosophy. I feel it is very child led and gentle, but we<br/>\ncertainly have limits and boundaries and controls if you will on food<br/>\nand media usage. Its just not healthy to eat junk food or candy. Its<br/>\njust not healthy to sit and watch TV all the time. Its just not healthy<br/>\nto let your kids do all this stuff, so why?? I am under the impression<br/>\nthat the child will eventually balance out and choose the &quot;right&quot; thing,<br/>\nbut how do they know what is right or wrong when they have been<br/>\nsubmitted to all the commercialism on TV and all the junk in their<br/>\ndiets? As I stated in another post, I am pretty liberal about food<br/>\nbecause I just cant limit my husband as much as I wish!!
