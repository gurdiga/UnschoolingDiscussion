(Next Thursday to be<br/>\nexact) (Thursday works since most of his &quot;school&quot; friends go to the waldorf<br/>\nschool and they take thursday afternoons off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, my wife has taken on most of the actual planning and organizing<br/>\nthat goes into having a fun party.  I have gotten as far as making sure<br/>\neveryone is invited and deciding there will be a treasure hunt...  BUT, I am<br/>\nstill looking for cool ideas that are party proven to work for 8-9 year old<br/>\nboys....<br/>\nAlso, I am trying to think of an alternative to the standad &quot;goody bags&quot;<br/>\nthat have become standard fare around here.  Something like a little craft<br/>\nproject they can take home, or a simple game etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny input or hot www links would be appreciated<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nJoshua</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7203,"nextTopicId":7201}}
