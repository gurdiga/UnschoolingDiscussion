She reads voraciously and fluently (novels now, but she<br/>\ndid a whole year of Calvin and Hobbes, The Far Side, Archies... but I<br/>\ndigress). She doesn&#39;t do much writing, although  about 9 months ago or so<br/>\nshe became more interested and started to occasionally write a poem, or<br/>\nwrite in her journal, or whatever. The problem is that she is<br/>\nextraordinarily concerned about correct spellings, and I&#39;m not sure what<br/>\nto do, if anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always spelled words that she asked me to spell for her (okay, once<br/>\nI tried the &quot;Can you sound it out?&quot; line and she was furious, and<br/>\nrightfully so, but I know better now). I&#39;m still happy to do that, or to<br/>\nwrite wheat she dictates, but she wants to do this on her own now. She<br/>\nactually spells most words correctly - she&#39;s quite visual and reads a lot<br/>\n- but she also spells many incorrectly, and she can see that they look<br/>\nwrong and is bothered by it. I think it started when she joined brownies<br/>\nlast year, and they were doing a project that involved writing, and Cacie<br/>\nwas cheerily working on it and asking the other girls if they knew how to<br/>\nspell this word or that, and one girl said something like, &quot;You don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to spell *little*? What grade are you in?&quot; in a really scornful<br/>\ntone, and ever since then it&#39;s been a sore spot. I wasn&#39;t there when it<br/>\nhappened, but she told me later.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example,  Cacie will bring me a poem she&#39;s written and wants me<br/>\nto read, and the first thing out of her mouth is always, &quot;It&#39;s all<br/>\nspelled wrong but I don&#39;t care.&quot; Clearly, though, she does care. Her<br/>\ndrama teacher is including some journalling this time, and she worries<br/>\nwhen she has to write  in class, because of her fear that that one of the<br/>\nother kids will make fun or her spelling and embarrass her. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis of course doesn&#39;t help my anti-schoolkid bias, but that&#39;s another<br/>\nstory....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;ve offered to help with spelling, I know there are lists of<br/>\ncommonly used words and I offered to get them for her... nope. I started<br/>\nby stating (and restating) my positions that:<br/>\n<br/>\n *If I can tell what she&#39;s saying, I think it&#39;s fine, because the whole<br/>\npurpose of writing is to communicate ideas and she&#39;s done that.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Kids in school spend (waste) a lot of time memorizing the spellings of<br/>\nthese words, and she&#39;s learned how to spell a ton of words just through<br/>\nthe stuff she reads, and I&#39;m convinced that she&#39;ll spell well as an adult<br/>\nbecause she is so visual<br/>\n<br/>\n*It&#39;s mean to be nasty to someone who asks for help or to make fun of<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s work, and I don&#39;t think the kids in her drama class would do<br/>\nthat, and I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this seems to make any difference. She is a bit of a<br/>\nperfectionist anyway, in a lot of things. She just seems so worried about<br/>\nit, and I think she enjoys writing now but feels badly about spelling<br/>\nwhen she does it, so she doesn&#39;t do it very often.
