These are things I used to do, but<br/>\nhave really been out of it lately, who knows why.<br/>\nBelated adjustment to Dad&#39;s death, or awkward<br/>\nadjustment to new house, life, relationship...who<br/>\nknows. I really don&#39;t think in as morbid of a way as I<br/>\nsounded in that post, but like I said, when I worry<br/>\nwithout reason and I know I&#39;m doing it, then I feel<br/>\nlike I am being a very morbid person...in comparison<br/>\nto the very peaceful, compassionate  person I was<br/>\nawhile ago. ( I actually got teased by my family for<br/>\nbeing that way to an extreme, so they felt guilty any<br/>\ntime they complained about anyone or thing. &lt;g&gt;)I know<br/>\nall these things that have been suggested to me, all<br/>\nthe breathing excercizes and yoga and relaxation<br/>\ntechniques, etc. work for me, but I am just trying to<br/>\nput them into practice lately, and having a hard time<br/>\ndoing it in the hectic-ness of daily life. Thanks to<br/>\neveryone for suggesting and caring and actually<br/>\nreading that long tangent of mine. I was not as<br/>\ntroubled as I seemed, but I tend to get carried away<br/>\nwhen writing about...anything. :)<br/>\nThanks, again. Caring posts are so nice to hear. <br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 4/2/01 8:30:12 PM,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:collettemattingly@...\">collettemattingly@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Bobbie, I think it is better to think too much<br/>\n&gt; than not at all.
