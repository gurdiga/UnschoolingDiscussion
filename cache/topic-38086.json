It was a response","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-160563905\">Well, actually, it&#39;s kind of interesting. Those that make viruses are very<br/>\ncreative, wish it was geared toward something less destructive.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n1. It was a response from your email directly because the virus has been<br/>\ntold to do that. See...usually viruses send themselves to everyone on an<br/>\naddress list and only in attachments to new addresses. Sounds like this one<br/>\nhas been programmed into the email client so that it also hits new addresses<br/>\nwhether there is an attachment or not. It&#39;s not really that difficult to do<br/>\nand I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve waited this long before hearing of it. Several of us<br/>\nhad already worked out this idea, but it was just a curiousity thing. We<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know if it would work because we aren&#39;t destructive enough to test it<br/>\n But I guess someone has figured it out. So anyone that person gets an email<br/>\nfrom is likely to get the virus right back. This happened the other day from<br/>\nmy grandmother, but I thought it was coincidence. Did you virus scanner<br/>\ncatch it on the way in? Thank goodness mine did!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n2. The address may not be bad. I don&#39;t know all the details as this is the<br/>\nfirst post I&#39;ve seen about it. But, the address may not be bad. Some viruses<br/>\nhave shut down the email client for use by the owner, but the virus itself<br/>\nof course still uses the client to spread itself. That&#39;s on a private email<br/>\naccount. If someone is using like hotmail or something, they may have been<br/>\ntrying to shut the email down (they can trace those viruses to accounts) and<br/>\nthe virus is interfering with that. Between the two there could be a big ole<br/>\nmess. I don&#39;t know if it could be deleting the address or not, I&#39;ve never<br/>\nlooked into it, I guess it&#39;s a possibility, but unless it is making new<br/>\naddies as fast as it&#39;s deleting them, that&#39;s counterproductive to most<br/>\nviruses modus operandi. Viruses are programmed to spread far and fast, it<br/>\nhas to have an email to spread from. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think the virus is making new addies, but I don&#39;t know<br/>\neverything. I&#39;m a hacker, not a criminal, so I don&#39;t usually go around<br/>\nmaking destructive viruses. :) What it could very well be (what sounds<br/>\nlogical to me) is a criminal using a side system and making email addies for<br/>\nuse to spread the virus and then deleting them for a new one so that it&#39;s<br/>\nnot as easily traceable.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNow of course, all of this is already known information with some conjecture<br/>\nand alot of common sense thrown in. But it is all very possible and now you<br/>\nve got me curious so I&#39;m going to go play with the idea.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAngi\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-------Original Message-------\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nDate: Monday, June 03, 2002 07:11:52 AM\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] email attachment caution\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/2/02 11:10:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time, \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Viruses often go out randomly and don&#39;t just attach themselves to \r<br/>\n&gt; troublemakers.
