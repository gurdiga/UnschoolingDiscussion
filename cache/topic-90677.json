He got a playstation from his older <br/>\nbrother, and has been doing a LOT of that, but I must admit, you guys <br/>\nwere right: He&#39;s doing lots of other things, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a playhouse within walking distance of us, and Abbie has <br/>\nbeen making the acquaintance of the people there. She went to a play, <br/>\nand introduced herself to the director, and found out about acting <br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Katie, my late-starting reader!!! yeee-haw! Started a diary <br/>\nyesterday. LOL I let her write things out her own self, and let me <br/>\ntell YOU...between spelling things completely by how they sound, and <br/>\nthe dyslexic tendency to reverse b&#39;s and d&#39;s...I couldn&#39;t really read <br/>\nwhat she wrote, until she decoded it for me. BUT...this is SO reading-<br/>\nready. And, she&#39;s been climbing on my lap lately, books in hand, and <br/>\neagerly attempting to read the words as well as look at the pictures. <br/>\nI think she will be reading well, before her next birthday. IF I can <br/>\nkeep my mom from stressing her out about it...grrr...&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we <br/>\nget her in Sylvan? She&#39;s reading awfully late, isn&#39;t she?&quot; grrrr.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me and my hubby, we&#39;re more energetic. Feeling like we&#39;ve <br/>\nbusted out of a rut big time, and loving it!<br/>\n<br/>\nnice &quot;seeing&quot; youse again!<br/>\n<br/>\nblessings, HeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90676,"nextTopicId":90679}}
