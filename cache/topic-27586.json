It works for some people.  And if I<br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep, even for those four hours,  I eat raw onions.  They knock me<br/>\nout!  I can&#39;t eat onions if I&#39;m going to be driving, they&#39;re that potent.<br/>\n I don&#39;t know if it will work for you, but you could always try a peanut<br/>\nbutter and onion sandwich if you wake in the night. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some other natural products you could try.  Calms forte, is a<br/>\nhomeopathic product.  I can&#39;t think of the others, sorry.  You could<br/>\ncheck with a natural food store maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nStress is bad.  When I was taking care of my dad during his final<br/>\nillness, all I could see when I closed my eyes was his dying body.  There<br/>\nwas no way to sleep.  Maybe there are relaxation tapes, visual imagery,<br/>\nself hypnosis?  Massage, a snuggly cat? ( dogs just steal your pillow ) <br/>\nI used St. John&#39;s wort and Kava kava.  It didn&#39;t always work but<br/>\nsometimes it seemed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.  <br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Campbell","from":"Campbell &lt;wegirls@...&gt;","profile":"brookitagals","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lCWedfqqmTJF-HIK8MoBnQ3RkogxLvNfDH4wcuzlmlss-v3G2NLqM1aVxP1NEVZei9lH0VubzINpcPrMgblIJ3rBIQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"getting back to sleep secrets","postDate":"1005569676","msgId":27586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDExMTEyMDQ1NDM2LjAwN2M1MTAwQHBvcC50ZWx1cy5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27589,"prevInTime":27585,"nextInTime":27587,"topicId":27586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there, Be it peri-menopausal syndrome or stress, I am waking often and early and can t get back to sleep.
