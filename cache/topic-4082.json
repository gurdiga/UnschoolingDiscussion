It&#39;s been in my head for years.  I grew up in a very abusive home and was an incredibly miserable child.  <br/>\nI loved any and all forms of escape.  Music (despite the fact that both parents were musicians and singers) was always my primary source of comfort.<br/>\nOnce when a family member came to visit he got a peek at just how desperate the situation was and came to our rescue (my brother&#39;s and mine). <br/>\nMy father told him to mind his own business and get the something out and never come back.  My father left in a huff, my mother ran off to console him<br/>\nand my uncle told me he that now he understood why I was the way I was but to always focus on the positive and remember that old song and sang some <br/>\nof it while he packed.   He was elderly and passed on while we were still little.   The only part I ever remembered was that last part and honestly it didn&#39;t really <br/>\nhelp me till I grew up but everytime I think of it it still makes me smile.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/28/99 at 7:46 AM rick and deborah farrington wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;From: rick and deborah farrington &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeybee@...\">honeybee@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative,<br/>\n&gt;latch on to the affrirmative,<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t mess with mister inbetween.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;is there more? my mom had this hanging on her mirror for a while, many<br/>\n&gt;years ago. it is good! thanks for the reminder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;Check it out!<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@aol.com","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Q25A3l2cO4l1qaFsb2CCMvpohL_9AObiiiNvSQFpJFEqYSZP8AeUSa9ercw1o4PywfhMh7Q9Tg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: accentuate the positive","postDate":"941208432","msgId":4084,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNzMuNDA4NC45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4082,"nextInTopic":4086,"prevInTime":4083,"nextInTime":4085,"topicId":4082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/28/99 9:42:27 AM, honeybee@camasnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1255857019\">In a message dated 10/28/99 9:42:27 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:honeybee@...\">honeybee@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &quot;accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative,<br/>\nlatch on to the affrirmative,<br/>\ndon&#39;t mess with mister inbetween.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nyou have to spread joy up to the maximum<br/>\nbring gloom down to the minumum<br/>\nhave faith or pandemonium is liable to walk upon the scene...<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is more, my 10yo daughter says, but thats all she&#39;s got at the moment...<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"rick and deborah farrington","from":"rick and deborah farrington &lt;honeybee@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Nt_nikqvEBaIaDhx4AmivWiLB6CDGgnf1hiFLz2gRD73LJgjuRlzDoE9FIho07VFPN5wwd8brqcyCn5ay_lS66UVZ08XKgDGYoPr0fHUdZnlvMvTcCQshb2w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"accentuate the positive","postDate":"941121962","msgId":4082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNzIuNDA4Mi45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4084,"prevInTime":4081,"nextInTime":4083,"topicId":4082,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, latch on to the affrirmative, don t mess with mister inbetween. is there more? my mom had this hanging on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2093752167\">&quot;accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative,<br/>\nlatch on to the affrirmative,<br/>\ndon&#39;t mess with mister inbetween.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nis there more? my mom had this hanging on her mirror for a while, many<br/>\nyears ago. it is good! thanks for the reminder.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4069,"nextTopicId":4103}}
