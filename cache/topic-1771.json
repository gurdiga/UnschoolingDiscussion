I  am not a very organized person and have a hard time tracking and<br/>\nremoving certain food items from her diet, I tend to loose track or forget<br/>\nwhat I was doing until it is to late and then have to start over again, I am<br/>\ncurrently trying to find out if the 1 year old is allergic to apples, diaper<br/>\nrash has been a major problem, so I cut out all apples, but coincedentally<br/>\nput him back on formula and cut the tomatoe based baby food out all at the<br/>\nsame time, he has eaten pizza with no effect and yesterday and today he had<br/>\na bottle of reg milk and so far no problems, so I guess I have to give the<br/>\napples back next to see!~     do you know how many baby foods have apples in<br/>\nthem? wow! I cannot even immagine what you go thru with the food items, how<br/>\ndo you choose things to eat?? I think that my life with my daughter must be<br/>\neasier than yours, she may be extreeme, but with patience and understanding<br/>\nwe get thru, but I don&#39;t think I would survive those severe allergies only<br/>\nbecause I am the queen of JUNK FOOD!!!! it would probably do me good to have<br/>\nto give it up, but I am pretty far gone !! well again, I am sorry to all<br/>\nthat I blew a gasket so quickly  and I do agree that kids should not be on<br/>\nfor the school days only  that comes from the doctors of whom I almost did<br/>\nin for suggesting that she not be on afterschool , weekends or summer, until<br/>\nthey have lived with her, which I offered  for them to do for a weekend to<br/>\nunderstand more completely ( they did not take me up on it I wonder why?)<br/>\nnow, if I expect absolutely nothing from my child including  behavior,<br/>\nresponsiblity, respect, self control of any sort,  self hygene,   not<br/>\ninflicting pain on others, then I do not need her to take her meds,  but<br/>\nwhen my child tells me that she can tell the difference and it helps her be<br/>\nin control of herself, then I do know I am doing the right thing, I hope I<br/>\ncan get myself together to test for allergies soon, what would you suggest<br/>\nas the best place to start? I do have the book is this your child, but have<br/>\nit out on loan to a friend .<br/>\nthank you  for your support to all who gave it, and I would have sent this<br/>\nthank you earlier in the week, but I have been up every night until 2:00 and<br/>\nsat until 5:00  with my best friend who was visiting from michigan, and her<br/>\n4 children, putting us up to 8 and during that time we painted my dining<br/>\nroom, stairwell, and hallway, sponge painte the livingroom , wallpapered one<br/>\nwall, and put up a border, (friday night and sat night)<br/>\nso I haven&#39;t had to much time to answer any email!!! there 65 to go thru<br/>\ntonight before my computer will let me receive any more~<br/>\nwell sorry this is soooo long, just making up for lost time oh yeah and<br/>\nJoel, I am not sure how I feel about the DARE program at this time but it<br/>\nmust have some effect on the kids because she just about wigged out when I<br/>\ndrank a beer this weekend!<br/>\nTanya OHio  feeling overly chatty tonight!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;Dear Tanya;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am so sorry that you are upset by the tone that the conversation has<br/>\n&gt;taken and I apologize for any offense that my statements may have given<br/>\n&gt;you.  I would like to point out that, since you are using my statements as<br/>\n&gt;fuel for your ire, that I did clarify that I was not speaking about parents<br/>\n&gt;whose children had been carefully diagnosed and for whom the medication was<br/>\n&gt;a necessary part of their treatment.  There is, in my opinion, a problem<br/>\n&gt;with misdiagnosis and overmedication of children with ADD, and I was<br/>\n&gt;speaking to that problem.  I happen to know people whom I think are being<br/>\n&gt;too quick to follow the advice of people not qualified to make such<br/>\n&gt;diagnosis, or people who are known for overprescribing medication.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know one ten year old little boy who has been on medication for the last<br/>\n&gt;5 years for ADD, but they only give it to him during the school week to<br/>\n&gt;ensure his maliablity in the classroom!  I think that is awful for him, and<br/>\n&gt;irresponsible of his parents.  I have watched him, overnight, on numerous<br/>\n&gt;weekends when he is NOT being medicated and while he is excitable and<br/>\n&gt;enthusiastic, and I do sometimes have to gently hold his chin to get him to<br/>\n&gt;focus on what I am saying to him, he is for the most part no problem.  He<br/>\n&gt;is a delightful child, loves to play complicated computer games, is<br/>\n&gt;intelligent and happy and articulate.  I do not believe that 5 day a week<br/>\n&gt;medication is a necessary course of action for him.  His mother does not<br/>\n&gt;work outside of the home and I see no reason why she could not spend more<br/>\n&gt;time with him at home, rather than sending him to school where they have to<br/>\n&gt;drug him into submission.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Let us all remember that this is a friendly discussion, and again, I<br/>\n&gt;apologize if I was generalizing or if my statements gave offense.  I value<br/>\n&gt;your voice and your opinions Tanya, and I don&#39;t want you to feel attacked<br/>\n&gt;or defensive here.  I am thankful that my children have not been diagnosed<br/>\n&gt;with ADD, however I have already had several people tell me that my older<br/>\n&gt;boy is a prime candidate for ADD.  He also has severe Asthma, allergies to<br/>\n&gt;spices and preservatives, pet allergies, extreme allergies (like projectile<br/>\n&gt;vomiting, hives and ER visits) to eggs and Dairy products, as well as a<br/>\n&gt;fatal allergy to ALL nuts.  I cannot let him out of my sight - ever.  When<br/>\n&gt;we are at playgroup I have to inspect EVERYTHING that the other children<br/>\n&gt;are eating to ensure his safety.  I will wash the other kids&#39; hands (if<br/>\n&gt;they were eating say, a cream cheese bagel or cheese) as his allergies are<br/>\n&gt;severe enough to have a skin reaction if they touch him.  I cannot tell you<br/>\n&gt;how many times my heart has leapt into my throat when I catch him eating<br/>\n&gt;something when I don&#39;t know what it is, or when other children try to share<br/>\n&gt;things with him and I have to shout NO! and hurry to interrupt the exchange<br/>\n&gt;before I have to take him to the hospital.  All this without scaring him or<br/>\n&gt;the other children or making him feel as though he is different.  Last week<br/>\n&gt;at Playgroup they had Carrot Cake (with Walnuts!) and my sons and I stayed<br/>\n&gt;locked in the house watching a video while the other moms and tots had<br/>\n&gt;their cake on the patio.  I have been advised by a number of ER doctors,<br/>\n&gt;and his Ped. to carry his Asthma medication, his Allergy medication and his<br/>\n&gt;skin medication EVERYWHERE he goes, &quot;Just in Case.&quot;  He cannot eat most<br/>\n&gt;things on kid&#39;s menus, he has never had Chinese food (due to a frequent use<br/>\n&gt;of nuts and nut oils,) he has never been to Day Care and has had VERY FEW<br/>\n&gt;babysitters.  He sleeps fitfully and often with a humidifier due to his<br/>\n&gt;Asthma.  He is not allowed to &quot;Help Himself&quot; to ANY FOOD, EVER!  Even if<br/>\n&gt;the other kids are all eating it, he still needs to ask Mom or Dad.  He has<br/>\n&gt;never had any Birthday Cake, or most baked goods for that matter, he has<br/>\n&gt;never had real ice cream or real milk, he has never had a grilled cheese<br/>\n&gt;sandwich or a peanut butter sandwich, or pizza, and I have almost lost him<br/>\n&gt;on several occassions already.  I dread the coming years when he will be<br/>\n&gt;more independent and running around with his friends and I will not be<br/>\n&gt;there.  One Peanut M & M, or one Reeses Pieces (which look like the regular<br/>\n&gt;M&M&#39;s that he CAN eat) and I would lose him, no joke!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So I do understand what it is like to deal with a child that has special<br/>\n&gt;needs on a daily basis and to answer other people&#39;s intrusive questions and<br/>\n&gt;dispell their misconceptions.

I would like to point out that, since you are using my statements as<br/>\nfuel for your ire, that I did clarify that I was not speaking about parents<br/>\nwhose children had been carefully diagnosed and for whom the medication was<br/>\na necessary part of their treatment.  There is, in my opinion, a problem<br/>\nwith misdiagnosis and overmedication of children with ADD, and I was<br/>\nspeaking to that problem.  I happen to know people whom I think are being<br/>\ntoo quick to follow the advice of people not qualified to make such<br/>\ndiagnosis, or people who are known for overprescribing medication.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know one ten year old little boy who has been on medication for the last<br/>\n5 years for ADD, but they only give it to him during the school week to<br/>\nensure his maliablity in the classroom!  I think that is awful for him, and<br/>\nirresponsible of his parents.  I have watched him, overnight, on numerous<br/>\nweekends when he is NOT being medicated and while he is excitable and<br/>\nenthusiastic, and I do sometimes have to gently hold his chin to get him to<br/>\nfocus on what I am saying to him, he is for the most part no problem.  He<br/>\nis a delightful child, loves to play complicated computer games, is<br/>\nintelligent and happy and articulate.  I do not believe that 5 day a week<br/>\nmedication is a necessary course of action for him.  His mother does not<br/>\nwork outside of the home and I see no reason why she could not spend more<br/>\ntime with him at home, rather than sending him to school where they have to<br/>\ndrug him into submission.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us all remember that this is a friendly discussion, and again, I<br/>\napologize if I was generalizing or if my statements gave offense.  I value<br/>\nyour voice and your opinions Tanya, and I don&#39;t want you to feel attacked<br/>\nor defensive here.  I am thankful that my children have not been diagnosed<br/>\nwith ADD, however I have already had several people tell me that my older<br/>\nboy is a prime candidate for ADD.  He also has severe Asthma, allergies to<br/>\nspices and preservatives, pet allergies, extreme allergies (like projectile<br/>\nvomiting, hives and ER visits) to eggs and Dairy products, as well as a<br/>\nfatal allergy to ALL nuts.  I cannot let him out of my sight - ever.  When<br/>\nwe are at playgroup I have to inspect EVERYTHING that the other children<br/>\nare eating to ensure his safety.  I will wash the other kids&#39; hands (if<br/>\nthey were eating say, a cream cheese bagel or cheese) as his allergies are<br/>\nsevere enough to have a skin reaction if they touch him.  I cannot tell you<br/>\nhow many times my heart has leapt into my throat when I catch him eating<br/>\nsomething when I don&#39;t know what it is, or when other children try to share<br/>\nthings with him and I have to shout NO! and hurry to interrupt the exchange<br/>\nbefore I have to take him to the hospital.  All this without scaring him or<br/>\nthe other children or making him feel as though he is different.  Last week<br/>\nat Playgroup they had Carrot Cake (with Walnuts!) and my sons and I stayed<br/>\nlocked in the house watching a video while the other moms and tots had<br/>\ntheir cake on the patio.  I have been advised by a number of ER doctors,<br/>\nand his Ped. to carry his Asthma medication, his Allergy medication and his<br/>\nskin medication EVERYWHERE he goes, &quot;Just in Case.&quot;  He cannot eat most<br/>\nthings on kid&#39;s menus, he has never had Chinese food (due to a frequent use<br/>\nof nuts and nut oils,) he has never been to Day Care and has had VERY FEW<br/>\nbabysitters.  He sleeps fitfully and often with a humidifier due to his<br/>\nAsthma.  He is not allowed to &quot;Help Himself&quot; to ANY FOOD, EVER!  Even if<br/>\nthe other kids are all eating it, he still needs to ask Mom or Dad.  He has<br/>\nnever had any Birthday Cake, or most baked goods for that matter, he has<br/>\nnever had real ice cream or real milk, he has never had a grilled cheese<br/>\nsandwich or a peanut butter sandwich, or pizza, and I have almost lost him<br/>\non several occassions already.  I dread the coming years when he will be<br/>\nmore independent and running around with his friends and I will not be<br/>\nthere.  One Peanut M & M, or one Reeses Pieces (which look like the regular<br/>\nM&M&#39;s that he CAN eat) and I would lose him, no joke!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I do understand what it is like to deal with a child that has special<br/>\nneeds on a daily basis and to answer other people&#39;s intrusive questions and<br/>\ndispell their misconceptions.
