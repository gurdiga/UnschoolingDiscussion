Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>\n&gt; relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; breath now. Thank-you to anyone that can pass some wisdom to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t change your parents or your in-laws. You CAN change YOUR lives. <br/>\nMake yourselves haoppy. Maybe after a while they&#39;ll see your happiness and join <br/>\nin. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, part of Unschooling is about showing our children that we have the <br/>\nability to make ourselves happy. To pursue our dreams. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaking yourselves miserable in order to make someone else happy isn&#39;t <br/>\nright---and the parents and in-laws seem to think that their misery NEEDS YOUR <br/>\ncompany.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the grandparents REALLY won&#39;t speak to their grandson because he <br/>\nMOVES---what kind of grandparents are they anyway? THAT&#39;S selfish! And just plain MEAN. <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want my boys to be around someone like that! Much less plan our <br/>\nlives around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet on with your lives---the move sounds wonderful! They&#39;ll come around. Or <br/>\nnot. Their decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74146,"nextTopicId":74152}}
