I think  you should always provide stimuli of all kinds so <br/>\nthe child gets a full idea of the thing anyway.  Something you only hear <br/>\nabout or see in a line drawing will not be learned as well as something you <br/>\ncan hear, see, taste, touch and smell.<br/>\n<br/>\nMultiple intelligences aren&#39;t the same as learning styles.  Someone can have <br/>\na high kinesthetic intelligence, like be a jock or a dancer, but that&#39;s not a <br/>\nlearning style.  That&#39;s an intelligence--a facet of live which that person <br/>\nunderstands naturally and deeply and learns more about easily (by various <br/>\nmethods of input).<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of labelling and categorizing kids, just give them all opportunities <br/>\nin all kinds of fields.  You could use Gardner&#39;s intelligences as a checklist <br/>\nfrom time to time, for yourself to decide what kinds of activities you might <br/>\nwant to add to your schedule.  If it&#39;s been a while since you got into nature <br/>\n(hiked, camped, hung out near water) maybe you should do that.  If you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t heard or played or sung much music lately, maybe try to work <br/>\nsomething musical in, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140850796,"authorName":"elfmama_2","from":"&quot;elfmama_2&quot; &lt;elfmama@...&gt;","profile":"elfmama_2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Kinesthetic learners","postDate":"1050377943","msgId":64919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3ZnVzbitjdmVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":64933,"prevInTime":64918,"nextInTime":64920,"topicId":64919,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was wondering, how can you tell if you have a kinesthetic learner?
