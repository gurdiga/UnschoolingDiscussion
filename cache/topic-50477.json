They<br/>\nlearned to be more careful and take better aim so the rock would actually<br/>\nmake it to the pond via the air rather than the glass. We also had the<br/>\nmelting candles on the carpet experience. So.............they again learned<br/>\nto be more careful. Now the &#39;parent led relaxed schooling&#39; people would tag<br/>\nthat math and science I guess. We just call it living. Is the window<br/>\nexpensive to replace? Yes. But what does that have to do with anything? It<br/>\nwas an accident. Life is filled with lots of things including accidents.<br/>\nLast month my husband was playing with the kids and guess what? He threw a<br/>\nfootball and you guessed it....glass shattered. I guess this was HIS math<br/>\nlesson for the day........he learned how many feet from the roof that window<br/>\nreally was!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point: it is a misconception to think that parents of unschoolers<br/>\ntypically hide their heads in the sand while their children intentionally<br/>\ncause harm to themselves, to others or to &#39;things&#39;.<br/>\nMagdalena</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50469,"nextTopicId":50257}}
