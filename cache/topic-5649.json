(It was a wonderful trip!)  This thread caught my interest because I <br/>\nalso am not big on a lot of outside classes.  If my kids have a strong desire <br/>\nto try something, I&#39;ll do what I can to help.  But they don&#39;t like to have <br/>\ntheir days or weeks very scheduled.  <br/>\n    I believe people, including kids, benefit from long expanses of time <br/>\nwhich they have to figure out what do with.  Some of the things we do with <br/>\nthis time are: getting into long, leisurely discussions about all kinds of <br/>\nthings, talking out differences, reading for hours at a time, writing, <br/>\nwalking, listening to music, playing games, visiting family and friends, <br/>\nthrowing a football back and forth, riding bikes, using the computer, <br/>\ndrawing, painting, etc.  Our activities don&#39;t sound particularly impressive <br/>\nbut we enjoy our days and feel that they are our own.  <br/>\n     We have occasionally taken classes and I am not against them but for us, <br/>\nthey have to be limited so as not to leave us without enough free time.  I <br/>\ndislike activities when I feel that we are there to have fun and yet we&#39;re <br/>\nnot having fun.  What&#39;s the point?  I related so much to what Mary Ellen said <br/>\nabout how it was much more satisfying to check out library books and then <br/>\ncome home and read them rather than sit at the library for story time.  But I <br/>\nknow that everyone is different and some people really enjoy being on the go <br/>\na lot.  Every family has to find its own way and even then, each family <br/>\nmember has to have his/her nature respected.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Lucy in California (again)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@juno.com","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"a8BJ64Cm6zuPVV2U2-MCSoUR4UK8s3jEMIX7G-EXSF4_w9v6Cv53f2EkpCKZ27t1tj8A5Y9rxQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Outside activities was socialisation","postDate":"948315092","msgId":5685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNzUuNTY4NS45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5672,"nextInTopic":5693,"prevInTime":5684,"nextInTime":5686,"topicId":5649,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I do feel bad for<br/>\nkids who spend 7 or 8 hours in school, then have two or three classes a<br/>\nweek.  When do they have time to just hang out?  I think well chosen<br/>\nclasses can be great for homeschoolers, but I don&#39;t see them as<br/>\nessential.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy philosophy of activities outside the home stems from laziness and<br/>\nvelcro kids.  I just don&#39;t seem to cope well when I&#39;m rushing all over<br/>\ntown.  I prefer a slower pace.  I do agree with some of the other posts<br/>\nthat there is a time for eveything.  My children are young and I expect<br/>\nclasses will be more important in the future.  (Maybe?)  Since reading<br/>\nDavid Albert&#39;s &quot;And the Skylark Sings With Me&quot; I am trying to be more<br/>\nalert to THEIR interests and offer those opportunities.  (Rather than<br/>\nputting them in an activity because it is popular or bc I like the idea)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I have come to the conclusion that many of those wonderful<br/>\nclasses do not give anything for our time and money that I can&#39;t do just<br/>\nas well at home, especially with my younger children (7&4).  Like driving<br/>\nto the library to listen to stories in a crowded group of noisy kids?  We<br/>\nprefer checking out a big pile of books and cuddling up on the couch at<br/>\nhome.  We recently tried a music class where she spent a lot of time<br/>\nwaiting for her turn and got stage fright so bad on performance day that<br/>\nshe was in tears.  Meanwhile at home, she will listen and sing along to<br/>\nfavorite songs over and over and over.  Maybe I am too picky, but<br/>\neverything we have tried so far is just too, well, &quot;schoolish&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Velcro aspect: With #1, I did regular mom & kid activities at the<br/>\nYMCA, etc, on up through a co-op preschool (which was actually great -<br/>\nbut that is for another post).  When she got to the age where most<br/>\nclasses are designed as &quot;drop off the kid&quot;, I would have to literally<br/>\npeel her off my leg and drag her crying to the class.  (Even if the<br/>\nviewing area was just a few feet away)  It didn&#39;t take me long to figure<br/>\nI did NOT want to be doing that.  So periodically we would try again --<br/>\nbecause there ARE a lot of appealing classes out there.  Or my learning<br/>\ncurve is really slow!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just started a gymnastics class for homeschoolers.  They have all ages<br/>\nat the same time, start with a group warm-up, then divide into three<br/>\ngroups of 10.  The class is an hour, but seems to dominate an entire<br/>\nafternoon by the time we get ready to go and include the 40 minute round<br/>\ntrip drive.  We are going to give it a couple of months before we decide<br/>\nwhether or not to continue.
