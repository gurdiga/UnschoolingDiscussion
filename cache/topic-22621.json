That is because the Health and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Human Services regulation that turns your medical data<br/>\n&gt; &gt;over to the government will go into effect permanently --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unless Congress passes HJR 38 by Friday, June 15.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Please read this short memo, immediately take the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;action at the bottom, then forward it to others who might<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be interested.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         BACKGROUND:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         On April 14, President Bush quietly directed<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;impose the so-called &quot;medical privacy regulations&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;were originally developed by the Clinton administration.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Bush&#39;s maneuver came despite the fact that the HHS had<br/>\n&gt; &gt;been inundated with nearly 100,000 angry letters and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;e-mails from Americans around the country.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         The most dangerous aspect of this regulation --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and the one most overlooked in news reports -- is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for the first time the government, rather than patients<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and doctors, would be in complete control of your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;private medical records. That&#39;s because the regulation<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forces doctors and hospitals to share all electronic<br/>\n&gt; &gt;medical records with the government for a variety of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;vague purposes, such as to &quot;streamline medical billing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;procedures&quot; or for &quot;public health surveillance.&quot; Then the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;government, rather than individual patients, will decide<br/>\n&gt; &gt;who gets to see them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         No wonder Americans are so worried. This<br/>\n&gt; &gt;regulation, which was published in the Federal Register<br/>\n&gt; &gt;on December 28, 2000, would:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Give dozens of government agencies and thousands<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         of bureaucrats access to your medical records --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         including the private notes of a psychotherapist<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         -- without your consent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Let government agencies share your records with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         marketing companies. The rules specifically allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         pharmacies to share prescription records &quot;for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         purpose of marketing health-related products and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         services&quot; without your consent.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Do nothing to prevent the government from<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         accessing your DNA information and transferring<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         it to &quot;third parties.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Permit police agencies to access medical records<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         without a search warrant.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Allow private insurance companies to compile the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         medical information into a database.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       * Prevent patients involved in health research<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         projects from accessing their own medical records<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         in some cases.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         How would you like a prospective employer to know<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that you have a &quot;genetic predisposition&quot; to contract a serious,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and expensive, illness?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         What if an acquaintance who worked for an insurance<br/>\n&gt; &gt;company or government agency could read the private notes of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;your psychotherapist, or find out if you have ever undergone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;drug or alcohol treatment?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Would you want others to know whether you&#39;ve had an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;abortion or been treated for an embarrassing disease?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         All of those things could happen if this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Clinton-Bush regulation is allowed to stand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to pick up the phone<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and call your U.S. representative today. If we can&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Congress to vote on HJR 38 by Friday, you can kiss your<br/>\n&gt; &gt;medical privacy goodbye!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;WHAT TO DO:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Call your U.S. House representative immediately at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;202-225-3121 or 202-224-3121 to request an immediate vote on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;House Joint Resolution 38 (HJR 38). This measure, sponsored<br/>\n&gt; &gt;by U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, declares that the HHS<br/>\n&gt; &gt;regulation &quot;shall have no force or effect.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;WHAT TO SAY:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         (1) Identify yourself and let them know you are a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;voter in their district. Leave your name, address, complete<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with ZIP code, and phone number. Please be brief, especially<br/>\n&gt; &gt;if you are leaving a message.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         (2) Ask them to tell House Speaker Dennis Hastert to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;schedule an immediate vote on HJR 38. Let them know that this<br/>\n&gt; &gt;measure must pass Congress by Friday -- or the HHS rules will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;remain in effect.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         (3) Ask them to vote *YES* on HJR 38. Then ask for a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;letter confirming their position.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Is there anything else you can do? Yes! Please<br/>\n&gt; &gt;forward this E-mail to a friend, and ask them to call their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;representative as well.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;         Thank you for your help!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Steve Dasbach<br/>\n&gt; &gt;National Director<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Libertarian Party<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The Libertarian Party                                <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lp.org/\">http://www.lp.org/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100                    voice: 202-333-0008<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Washington DC 20037                                   fax: 202-333-0072<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1957,"nextTopicId":22411}}
