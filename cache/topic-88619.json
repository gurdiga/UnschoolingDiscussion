Then along came Holly, who said &quot;I hate Big <br/>\nBird.  Turn it off, turn it off!&quot;   She discovered our old Sesame Street tapes a <br/>\nyear and a half or two ago, and get QUITE into it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo even someone who misses ten years of Sesame Street can catch up in just a <br/>\nshort time when she really WANTS to. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we were in a thrift store and the music somehow played &quot;Welcome Back, <br/>\nKotter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Holly if she knew what it was, and she said no.  &quot;It&#39;s the themesong <br/>\nof a TV show called &#39;Welcome Back, Kotter.&#39;  John Travolta was in it.  It was <br/>\nabout a high school special ed class.  But it was really fantasy because there <br/>\nwere just six or eight kids in the class, and they were fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is that what made him famous?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I realized a woman was hearing all that.  She didn&#39;t look at us, but I <br/>\ncould tell by her profile that she was some kind of surprised or amused.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I thought maybe it was not the kind of conversation most moms and <br/>\ndaughters have in public.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Holly is really with it about music, and that&#39;s a ton of fun for me.  So <br/>\nfor her, John Travolta wasn&#39;t a movie star or a disco king (though she&#39;s <br/>\nsomewhat aware of that), he&#39;s the star of Grease, a singer!  And he&#39;s someone who&#39;s <br/>\nbeen performing since he was young and is still acting.  She knows that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88542,"nextTopicId":88163}}
