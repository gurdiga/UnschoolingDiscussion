When Diana asked, I kind of hoped someone else would jump in to <br/>\nsummarize before I could reply. I&#39;m not sure how to explain how the show (PBS <br/>\nFrontline: Killer at Thurston High) made me feel without sounding like I&#39;m <br/>\njudging the parents or the school or the other adults in this kid&#39;s life. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few of things that made me cry: When he was four, his parents, high school <br/>\nteachers, took a sabbatical in Spain and the kids were put in school there. <br/>\nKip couldn&#39;t speak Spanish, was bullied by the other kids, and hated it. His <br/>\nolder sister did quite well, as she seemed to do at everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the States, Kip had trouble learning to read and was &quot;held back&quot;, <br/>\ndespite what sounded like hours of after school reading &quot;help&quot; from his <br/>\nparents (which was made to sound like a good thing, but made me cringe for <br/>\nthis little boy). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m not sure anyone could summarize the reasons why this boy killed his <br/>\nparents. It didn&#39;t seem to be rage as much as -- what? -- fear? Knowledge <br/>\nthat he wasn&#39;t &quot;measuring up&quot; again? Despair? Perhaps he felt like seeing <br/>\ntheir disappointment in him again would just kill him. (He had just been <br/>\ncaught with a gun at school, and his Dad had picked him up at the police <br/>\nstation. They had just gotten home when Kip went up to his room and came down <br/>\nwith a gun and shot his father in the back of the head.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing is on the Frontline site. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kinkel/\">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kinkel/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping someone here had some words of wisdom, because I was left <br/>\nfeeling sad and confused by the whole thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"&quot;Betsy Hill&quot; &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"EZMzPzOGbVwXHgxXbcSDeCpTWa1PG-jGT7jdAyb4bO-k6ddO5AuLzF5BIkyttw0j2g8AYs1hmtFssDtUOTk_pDPu6HL9xI_JvQrr9U8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] choose for them or let them choose?","postDate":"991274605","msgId":22291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3M0JBNkVDLTIwNkVDQDIwOS4xNzkuMjUxLjIzMz4="},"prevInTopic":22283,"nextInTopic":22292,"prevInTime":22290,"nextInTime":22292,"topicId":22152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We could desperately use the money right now,<br/>\nbut it is a matter of priorities for us. I would like to have the money.<br/>\nIt would make life a lot easier. We were afraid of the lifestyle. But we<br/>\nhave choices. It is either creature comforts or our son&#39;s welfare. Don&#39;t<br/>\nmisunderstand: we have a roof over our heads, a car, food in the pantry,<br/>\ntwo computers, and money for utilities, so we are making it. We also<br/>\nhave a child who is much happier ; is beginning to enjoy learning ; is<br/>\nlearning on his terms and on his own timetable. We no longer go from one<br/>\ncrisis to another. We no longer have the constant power struggles with a<br/>\nteacher and inept principal . We no longer have a child who is under<br/>\npressure to the extent of almost being clinically depressed. We can all<br/>\ngo to bed when it meets our needs, without being concerned about<br/>\nhomework, or tests. Our son can play on the computer as late as he<br/>\nwants..He and my husband are night owls and like to stay up late.<br/>\nSelfishly speaking, I am no longer in a stressful work environment ; am<br/>\ngetting time to rest when I need it ; and now have time to pursue some<br/>\nof my own interests.<br/>\nMy assessment is that we are all much better off for having made the<br/>\nchange.

So I figured if at the end <br/>\nof a year he hadn&#39;t learned what kindergartners should&#39;ve, or if he still <br/>\nwasn&#39;t much more ready for formal groups stuff, I could put him in <br/>\nkindergarten the following year.  And, I figured, if he went great guns and <br/>\nWANTED school, and was all zippily prepared, I could say &quot;we homeschooled <br/>\nkindergarten&quot; and I could put him directly into first grade.  So I had a big <br/>\nfield of calm about that first year.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring that time, I got involved reading about homeschooling and <br/>\ncorresponding with homeschoolers, and there it was and here I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Marty would probably want to go to school.

I also <br/>\nthought it would be a way for the two of them not to crowd one another in <br/>\nlife.  But when time came, Marty wanted to stay home.  Holly could have gone <br/>\nto school, and used to say she wanted to.  When she explained WHY she wanted <br/>\nto, though, it was very unrealistic.  She wanted to be in school with two of <br/>\nthe neighbors she always played with, but one was a year ahead of her and one <br/>\nwas two years ahead and went two blocks across the crowded thoroughfare <br/>\ninstead of eight blocks through the neighborhood to the &quot;real&quot; assigned <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a cool period of time in our lives.  Holly spoke wistfully of it <br/>\nthis morning, about how many kids were in the old neighborhood.  None are <br/>\nthere now but one teen.  But for a while, there were five houses with kids <br/>\nwithin an eight-house spread.  No two families went to the same school (two <br/>\ndifferent public schools, a Catholic parochial, a private protestant school, <br/>\nand us homeschooling), so our kids weren&#39;t the odd ones out at all.

I was a kind of radical teacher (a hippie who didn&#39;t use the <br/>\ntextbook).

And if more people see that this is <br/>\navailable to them as homeschoolers, perhaps more people will feel <br/>\nthat they &quot;can do&quot; homeschooling (and yes, I know that we all know on <br/>\nthis list that you don&#39;t *need* all these bells and whistles to <br/>\nhomeschool, but the majority of people out there will feel more <br/>\ncomfortable doing it if they have resources available to them). <br/>\nPerhaps then someday we&#39;ll have a system that offers education for <br/>\nthose who want it, when they want it. To a certain extent, I do <br/>\nbelieve in the laws of economics (at least in our semi-capitalist <br/>\ncountry, USA). If people take their kids from school, and use their <br/>\ntax dollars to support an educational system in which kids have free <br/>\nchoice, then those choices will become more and more available. I&#39;m <br/>\nstill not sure if I myself will choose to do this (largely because of <br/>\nthe logistics of registering with the system to do so), but in <br/>\ngeneral I think it&#39;s a positive direction for schools to be heading.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;A bee is pollinating my eye&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Asa eat buggy&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"WPkCHJf9msMkj_YezsGvcqMTLZ8IiXNDhDkG_PP5PFOzPc_uEpxYn3cTHzMlBLr-4fSazNUiK2VY","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] choose for them or let them choose?","postDate":"991235468","msgId":22229,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjLjE1MzhkYWVhLjI4NDY2NzhjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22222,"nextInTopic":22232,"prevInTime":22228,"nextInTime":22230,"topicId":22152,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/30/01 7:14:42 AM, nicki@detroitmama.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-904728348\">In a message dated 5/30/01 7:14:42 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nicki@...\">nicki@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I learned the hard way about what was best for me, how<br/>\nI learn best, what my own goals were.

Dh and I talked about this a lot last<br/>\nnight and I&#39;d like to hear other&#39;s points of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, as an unschooler, I believe that children should have the<br/>\npower to dictate their days. If they want to spend 10 hours doing math<br/>\nworksheets that is their day, who am I to interfere. If they want to spend 6<br/>\nmonths digging in the dirt I value that there must be something very<br/>\nimportant (educationally) going on and butt out. When you take away a<br/>\nchild&#39;s power to learn what they want, when they want - you can easily take<br/>\naway their love of learning. Resentment builds when you are told how to<br/>\nlearn, when to learn, what to learn. Soon learning is seen as a chore to be<br/>\ndone, at best, begrudgingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I am the parent. And although that doesn&#39;t mean, for me,<br/>\nthat I lord my power and control over my children I DO think there are<br/>\nthings I&#39;ve learned (the hard way) in life that I&#39;d like to spare my<br/>\nchildren from. I don&#39;t subscribe to the mentality that &quot;every hard lesson in<br/>\nlife makes you stronger/wiser/better&quot;. I think there are plenty of hard<br/>\nlessons I could have avoided and actually come out a much<br/>\nstronger/wiser/better person for having avoided them. School is one of those<br/>\nareas for me. I hated it and seriously searched for my own answer but did<br/>\nnot have any support. I learned the hard way about what was best for me, how<br/>\nI learn best, what my own goals were. I could have avoided all of that had I<br/>\nbeen &quot;allowed&quot; out of school at a much younger age. I am positive of this. I<br/>\nspent ALL my spare time learning and school was simply something to resent<br/>\nfor taking away my learning time. I would have been much better served to<br/>\nspend 12 hours a day doing what I love instead of 2 hours a day. But had you<br/>\nasked me when I was 6,7.8 if I wanted to homeschool I&#39;m sure I would have<br/>\nthought you crazy &lt;grin&gt;. The concept was as foreign to me then as it was<br/>\nwhen I was 16 and wanted out of school. I was reluctant but that does not<br/>\nmean it would have been the best decision for me. I feel like I needed a<br/>\nparent to stand up for me and make those hard decisions for me. Sometimes,<br/>\neven as adults, we can&#39;t see what would make us happiest and be in our best<br/>\ninterest because we are too close to the fire, so to speak. I had a hunch<br/>\nbut could not put the action to it to make it happen in the best way<br/>\npossible. I feel the same for my child - that he has a hunch and an<br/>\ninclination but does not have the maturity or the *something* - I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat - to make a decision. He is a happy fence-sitter like me. He is happy<br/>\nto do whatEVER he is thrown into (probably all those years or being thrown<br/>\nback and forth). Yes, he says, he loves to stay home from school. Yes, he<br/>\nsays, he loves going to school. He is just a happy-go-lucky kid.

Is<br/>\nit fair that we have to miss out on LOTS of opportunities because Dalton has<br/>\nchosen to go to public school? That we have to skip fun out of town trips,<br/>\ngoing to museums and other longer adventures because it will run into the<br/>\ntime we must pick Dalton up from school?  Then it is fair that we all have<br/>\nto listen to Dalton whine about how mean we are for having gone to some<br/>\ngreat exploration without him?

It was the worst of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1310466359\">&lt;&lt;A Waldorf-inspired school&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son went to a waldorf-inspired charter for a few months of K before I was<br/>\nso horrified I pulled him. It was the worst of Waldorf combined with the<br/>\nworst of PS. It was terrifying. They had children being &quot;punished&quot; in K by<br/>\nhaving them run multiple mile-long laps at recess instead of being allowed<br/>\nto play. My son was FOUR! They had more rules than I could dream ANY<br/>\nkindergarten child could abide by.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result was that my son&#39;s passion for art disappeared when he was only<br/>\n&quot;allowed&quot; to do his art at certain times, in certain places and in very<br/>\nrestricted ways. He was constantly getting in serious trouble, being sent to<br/>\nthe corner (I thought this punishment method went out years ago - I<br/>\ncertainly never encountered it in school), time-outs, running laps. Talk<br/>\nabout taking a child&#39;s love of physical exercise away from them! Oh, my<br/>\ncomplaints are too long and drawn out to bother with. Suffice it to say you<br/>\ncan&#39;t truly teach in a waldorf way unless you are a waldorf fan. You can not<br/>\nsend your average PS teacher to a week-long Waldorf training session and<br/>\nexpect them to continue on the traditions of waldorf education. And,<br/>\nultimately, charters (here at least) are still PS entities - they still<br/>\nrequire testing, grades, push competition, have bullies and bad teachers,<br/>\nall the politics involved with any other PS and lots more on top of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son goes to a &quot;regular&quot; PS now with an &quot;alternative&quot; mutli-age program<br/>\ninstead of typical placements of first grade, second grade, etc. It is only<br/>\nup through age 8. You move on to 3rd grade. You stay with the same teacher<br/>\nfor two years, same students as well. There is an emphasis on cooperation<br/>\nand moving at your own pace and being the learner you want to be. I fell in<br/>\nlove with the multiage program at it&#39;s orientation but as I&#39;ve<br/>\ndemonstrated - it is just another PS. My son&#39;s teacher is moving on to<br/>\nanother school within the district so he would not even have the benefit of<br/>\n2 years worth of the same teacher. Half the students move every year so even<br/>\nthat stability isn&#39;t really existent. As for the emphasis on cooperation and<br/>\nmoving at your own pace - there is TONS of competition, bragging, gloating<br/>\nand emphasis on success and &quot;whose the best&quot;. The children still fall into<br/>\ncategories &quot;Younger&quot; and &quot;Older&quot; so what is the point of just calling them<br/>\nthose things instead of &quot;first grade&quot; or &quot;second grade&quot;. It&#39;s all just words<br/>\nwhen they are not treated any differently. From my past intro you can see<br/>\nthat my son did not get treated as if he is in charge of his learning and he<br/>\nwas not allowed to learn how he is most comfortable at the level which he<br/>\nprefers. It&#39;s all just talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharters are GREAT at telling parents what they want to hear. I have not yet<br/>\nheard of a real charter in this area that is anything other than a typical<br/>\nPS with all the same problems of other PS despite the &quot;alternative&quot; hopes.
