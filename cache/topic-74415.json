I realize not everyone likes to<br/>\nor even remembers to send cards. So I don&#39;t expect them. I like them. And<br/>\nwhat I like more is to know that what I have done has made a difference to<br/>\nsomeone.

I used to do that, and then a friend of ours (who was a friend of my husband&#39;s) told me not to bother, bec. she doesn&#39;t expect that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I stopped sending them unless it was a special occasion.  For example, last fall we had Shabbot dinner with an Orthodox family that we&#39;d never met but that had offered to have us over so we could learn more about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent them a Thank you card because I didn&#39;t know how soon I&#39;d be in touch again and I wanted them to know we appreciated it, even if we didn&#39;t come back again for a long time.  (Sunset at rush hour just doesn&#39;t work well in the city :o)).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t send cards for gifts anymore.  There is one family who gives us amusement park tickets almost every year and I think maybe we should give them something...but then we do give them gifts at xmas and stuff too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there&#39;s my neighbor who watched our dog when we went camping in September...well, I forgot to pick something up for her at the beach and I am bad at remembering thank you cards anyway (and she gives thank you&#39;s for everything!), so I got her a nice xmas gift and a card that I wrote &quot;good friends, good neighbors&quot; on, and got a little something for each of their kids.  And then when I had a chance to talk to her, I told her that I hadn&#39;t forgotten all the nice things they  had done throughout the year for us, and I was happy they were our friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t do it routinely.
