This <br/>\nmorning Jesse read his book on chess puzzles, Owen got out one of his bird <br/>\nidentification books. Meredith, 14, searched the Internet for unicorn <br/>\npictures for an art class we&#39;re teaching this summer. Then the boys made <br/>\nlemon/lime/orange juice and went to dig dirt to plant the seeds. They just <br/>\nhad mac and cheese for lunch and Owen is in front of the TV half watching Mr. <br/>\nRogers. Jesse is washing an old toy with a toothbrush. Mer is reading a <br/>\ndragon book. Nintendo hasn&#39;t been on today, but I might remind them that it&#39;s <br/>\nthere if they come to me with the &quot;bored&quot; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOwen has learned lots of math and reading while playing Nintendo and Gameboy <br/>\nand Neopets on the computer. Some days when the weather is beautiful, the <br/>\nboys are glued to Nintendo and some days when it rains they are outside in <br/>\ntheir forts in the woods, playing Survivor. I feel like a hypocrite when I <br/>\nlimit something that they enjoy. (I don&#39;t mean that this doesn&#39;t work for <br/>\nother parents. Like I said, we&#39;re all different. For sure there are other <br/>\nparents who model structure and schedules better than I do -- let&#39;s face it, <br/>\nI&#39;m lazy.) When I&#39;m in the middle of a favorite book, no one says, &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>\nyou put that down and go get some exercise? You&#39;ve been glued to that book <br/>\nall day.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I have this feeling that if Nintendo is what they desire, there must <br/>\nbe a good reason. I kind of trust that feeling, you know? (Have you seen kids <br/>\nplay this stuff and how fast their minds are clicking along? I know I can&#39;t <br/>\ndo it like they do.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, add one to the &quot;no limits on Nintendo&quot; poll. (Also, I&#39;m a Liberal <br/>\nDemocrat, with Green Party leanings.

I&#39;ve found that Playstation has <br/>\nmore family-friendly games than the other systems (Scrabble, Wheel of <br/>\nFortune, Jeopardy, etc.) as well as more kid-type games.  I would suggest <br/>\npopping by an online store to check out the games yourself as far as <br/>\nratings (ebgames.com has the ratings and what to expect, such as comic <br/>\nmischief, language, etc.) and prices go.  Nintendo is much more expensive <br/>\nfor games than Playstation and if you look on Ebay you can find good <br/>\ndeals.

Her son at the time was 5. My<br/>\nhusband and I at the time had no kids yet but we did have nintendo (all of them;<br/>\nthe original, super, 64 & now a gameboy). My husband and I grew up with video<br/>\ngames and spent lots of our time together playing with it (it was definitely<br/>\ncheaper than going to the movies). Anyway, we would on occasion, babysit for our<br/>\nneighbors and during this time he had found out that we had nintendo. His mother<br/>\nrefused to buy him one, afraid he would spend every waking hour playing this<br/>\ninstead of playing outside with his friends. But she thought that it was ok for<br/>\nhim to play with it when he was over at our house. To make a long story short<br/>\n(too late), what she did notice is that his hand-eye coordination improved<br/>\ngreatly. He did not become obsessed and could put the game down whenever he was<br/>\nasked to without complaint. The games that we had were not the extremely violent<br/>\nones either, they were the Mario bros, racing, Zelda, pong, etc. No one getting<br/>\ntheir heads blown off or blood flying everywhere. Those type of games are still<br/>\nnot purchased in my house. She did end up buying a used nintendo for him and<br/>\nrented games from our library.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd just received a gameboy this last Christmas from Santa. She has never<br/>\nplayed with one in the past so never even really knew what one is. She has a<br/>\ntotal of 3 games for this. We mainly thought it would be helpful when we take<br/>\nour journeys in the car that were going to be over 30 min. It helps the time go<br/>\nby. She is not possessed by this and in fact, hasn&#39;t recently even played with<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are really concerned about nintendo and its effects, rent one first or<br/>\nborrow one from a friend. Set up certain times that the system can be used and<br/>\nsee how your family reacts to it. Some kids, I would imagine do get a little<br/>\ncrazed when they first get one, but my two dds get more excited if I make<br/>\nbrownies!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and on a final note;  there is a website that you can go to that actually<br/>\nhas the exact nintendo games that you can play on line now.

When I <br/>\nwent to pick him up from there, he and the two boys were sitting in front of <br/>\nthe game, totally oblivious to everything around them, eyes fixed on the <br/>\nscreen, mouths hanging open. It was a beautiful day outside but no interest <br/>\nin playing outdoors! THe kids&#39; mom advised me to hold off getting one, <br/>\nbecause when you do, it&#39;s all they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize if something is this compelling, it must have some value, even if <br/>\nI can&#39;t see what it is. I&#39;m also wondering if this is an interest that blows <br/>\nover, or if it will lead to vid-game potato kids with no inclination to do <br/>\nanything else!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette N<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19218,"nextTopicId":19024}}
