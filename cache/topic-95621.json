Keep home a really interesting, safe, loving<br/>\n<br/>\nplace. Take her side in any conflicts she has with the<br/>\n<br/>\nschool, while keeping in mind that she may have<br/>\n<br/>\nimportant relationships with adults there that she<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want damaged. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is such a loving, sweet take on public or private school.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I feel it is a bit idyllic.  A child cannot go home whenever<br/>\nhe or she wants. Even when my nephew was having asthama and wanted the<br/>\nschool to call his mom, the school &#39;assessed the situation and decided the<br/>\ncall was unwarranted.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your children are in public school (2 of my kids have been), the parent<br/>\nlooses the ability to parent the child while the child is on the school<br/>\npremises.  Sometimes depending on the teacher there is collaboration, but<br/>\nmost often the rules, attendance requirements (a tardy officer from the<br/>\nstate may visit your home), discipline (you missed the work while you were<br/>\nout yesterday, so no recess for you) are in motion whether you as a parent<br/>\nare aware of it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy view is that if you are uncoiling, then do it.  That encompasses a<br/>\ncertain &quot;lifestyle&quot; in which you support your children in perusing their<br/>\ngoals.   If your children are in public school, as a parent you must do the<br/>\nsame; make sure they are there on time, have money or a sack lunch ready,<br/>\nhelp them have a place for homework (20 min. per grade, excluding spelling<br/>\npractice and extra projects) and give them the support to finish projects on<br/>\ntime, etc...  The child will suffer at public school if the parent is not<br/>\ninvolved.  For unschooling families, the involvement may be too intrusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids do NOT want to go back to public school.  They experienced it.  I do<br/>\nagree with you that for children who want to experience school, the parent<br/>\nshould support the child&#39;s decision.  But be aware: the decision has &#39;rules&#39;<br/>\nattached to it that may affect the parent&#39;s role.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRebeca Z. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95620,"nextTopicId":95484}}
