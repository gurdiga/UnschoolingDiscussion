I&#39;m sure her spot at the center <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be lost if she left for a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking for a reason to change: tell her that different trainers <br/>\nhave unique things to offer. Years ago when I owned a tack shop, I took a <br/>\nclass every weekday morning (before opening at 10:00) from a different <br/>\ntrainer---I can&#39;t tell you how much I learned in a few months&#39; time. This vs <br/>\nclasses from the same trainer all the time. She would probably be surprised <br/>\nat the HUGE improvement in a short amount of time by changing for a while (or <br/>\npermanently).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus the more you&#39;re &quot;on&quot; and around the horses and the more (different) <br/>\nhorses you&#39;re with, the more they (the horses) put you on the spot to <br/>\nperform---and improve. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for expenses---has she not looked into working for time on? Mucking <br/>\nstalls? Pulling manes? Feeding in the mornings (since school kids don&#39;t have <br/>\nthis opportunity)? Or evenings? If it&#39;s a ritzy equestrian center, she might <br/>\nfind someone with $$ but not a lot of time who would like her to ride or <br/>\ngroom or clean tack. Or even hand-walk/bathe a sick horse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to make a TON of money as a teen because I could clean tack like <br/>\nnoone&#39;s business. I could also clip the horses and pull & braid manes. I&#39;d <br/>\ntake folks&#39; tack home with me Thursday nights and clean it all, then be at <br/>\nthe barn by 4:00 to braid manes and tails before the shows. I charged by the <br/>\nbraid! I can make &#39;em REALLY tiny and neat!! &lt;G&gt; With colored yarn, extra! I <br/>\nput checkerboards on their rumps for extra. I was the only one at one barn <br/>\nwho knew how to put bandages on---this back when they were quilts and wraps <br/>\nand not velcro! &lt;G&gt;  I usually MADE money on foxhunt/event/show weekends even <br/>\nWITH entry fees, trailer fees, and food.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on the barns. I started at a &quot;poor&quot; barn where everyone did her <br/>\nown work---and learned A LOT!!! But the high-rent barns are a GREAT place for <br/>\nmaking $$$ doing stuff other folks don&#39;t WANT to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to talk with her about stuff! She can IM me anytime!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45379,"nextTopicId":44587}}
