I go through our town&#39;s <br/>\nweekly calendar once a week with the kids and we put stuff on our own <br/>\ncalendar that they might be interested in, stuff like plays, <br/>\nreadings, story times, parades, peace vigils, classes, or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nI buy things -- like my recent purchase of some early reader books <br/>\nthat are themed on the Lego characters my son loves, knowing he would <br/>\njust be overcome with excitement when he saw them (he was) -- because <br/>\nI know he&#39;s bored with the early reader-type books we have around the <br/>\nhouse (Dr. Seuss and Bob books). That doesn&#39;t mean I expect him to <br/>\nsit down and read them, which I guess would be &quot;planning learning&quot;, <br/>\nbut he does some times, and some times he asks me to read them to <br/>\nhim. They&#39;re there, they&#39;re available, sparking interest in the world <br/>\nof reading. I buy other things that I think the kids will be <br/>\ninterested in. Sometimes I&#39;m right (word magnets for the <br/>\nrefridgerator, a scale to measure things), sometimes I&#39;m wrong <br/>\n(cuisinaire rods). I think where unschooling really comes in is that <br/>\nthere&#39;s no pressure on the kids to use them, especially in the case <br/>\nwhere I&#39;m wrong and they&#39;re not interested. Also, I can watch their <br/>\ninterest wax and wane without anxiety. My son will use the <br/>\nrefridgerator magnets for a solid week, making up poems and writing <br/>\nthem down on paper. Then for several weeks he might not touch them at <br/>\nall. Both are okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also attend homeschooling and other events that the kids are <br/>\ninterested in, on a weekly basis. They always get to choose a class <br/>\nor two to do as well if they want to - last year my daughter chose <br/>\ngymnastics and my son horseback riding and swimming. At times when <br/>\nthey see something that they&#39;re interested in, as my son was at a <br/>\nJapanese festival we went to that had martial arts demonstrations, I <br/>\nwill mention that classes are available in that subject if they&#39;re <br/>\ninterested (neither was interested in pursuing martial arts at that <br/>\npoint).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also things that I do just for me that they come along to. <br/>\nOften they ask to be included in my activites. Sometimes they don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be or can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t mean that I would just sit around eating bon-bons and not <br/>\n&gt;have to be present , but I guess it just doesn&#39;t seem like we have <br/>\n&gt;enough excitement around here. I am worried that I somehow need more <br/>\n&gt;to spur their curiosity? They really seem bored at times. I keep <br/>\n&gt;thinking, how can they be bored already, they are only 5! I hope <br/>\n&gt;this question is clear. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes boredom can be a great spur to finding new interests. But <br/>\nsometimes (especially with kids this young), it can be very <br/>\nfrustrating for the parent. I know my kids tend to act out a lot more <br/>\nif they&#39;re bored, picking fights with each other, etc. So if that <br/>\nstarts happening, we just go out of the house on some adventure or <br/>\nanother. My kids are both pretty high-energy, gregarious, extroverts. <br/>\nSo they need/want a lot of interaction, stimulation, movement, etc. <br/>\nThey are always asking me to call someone to come play or to go <br/>\nsomewhere (even if we&#39;ve just gotten home from a 6-hour playtime at <br/>\nthe park with friends, LOL!). So what works for us is to be busy most <br/>\nof the time, doing things, usually with other people. That might not <br/>\nwork for others though, I have friends whose kids prefer to stay home <br/>\na lot more than mine do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if this answers anything. I do think that once a person <br/>\nreleases the expectations of &quot;learning&quot; and the way that looks, then <br/>\nanything they feel free to do or suggest to their kids will just flow <br/>\nalong - sometimes working, sometimes not, but not causing anxiety <br/>\neither way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6464451,"authorName":"Amie","from":"&quot;Amie&quot; &lt;tcee1@...&gt;","profile":"mascire2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"grasping unschooling","postDate":"1036132612","msgId":48996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMyODE3MSQxMjhmMTY1MCQwMDAwYTM5OEB5b3VyNXJscDNhOTUxNj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49021,"prevInTime":48995,"nextInTime":48997,"topicId":48996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really thought that I had a handle on what unschooling is.
