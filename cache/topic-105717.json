How do they differ from this  list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am on several, but due to not having enough time to read all of them  every <br/>\nday, I&#39;m signed onto most of them by &#39;read only&#39; or &#39;digest&#39; versions and  <br/>\nthen read when I have free time.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThis is one of my favorites...plus I&#39;m always over to Sandra&#39;s personal  site <br/>\nreading and re-reading her articles : )  But the 2 that I get the  mail via <br/>\nindividual posts and that I find are most helpful personally to  me, are Always <br/>\nUnschooled (Danielle & Robin&#39;s list) and Shine With  Unschooling (Anne <br/>\nOhman&#39;s list).  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlways Unschooled is a very gentle list with lots of &#39;warm&#39; regular posters  <br/>\n- I&#39;ve had real breakthroughs reading the wonderful posts on that list!!!   <br/>\nThere are a handful of women on that list who have REALLY made a positive impact <br/>\n on my life w/their observations and insights.  Always Unschooled has  lots <br/>\nof threads that pertain specifically to younger children, or so it  seems.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe Shine list is specifically for unschooling &#39;non-typical&#39; children (  <br/>\nhighly sensitive children, explosive, Aspergers,  ADD, &#39;spirited&#39; are some  of the <br/>\nexamples Anne lists on the list description, I think) and is so wonderful  f<br/>\nor celebrating our kids and helping them SHINE.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey&#39;re both yahoo groups.<br/>\n <br/>\nxoxo,<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":105715,"nextTopicId":105647}}
