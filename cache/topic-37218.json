Joy&#39;s situation with her son is so similiar<br/>\nto mine with my youngest son, Bay. He is virtually uninterested in any solo<br/>\nendeavors - period. . . unless they are on the computer or TV - which I<br/>\nalso feel strongly about not having be major factors in our lives here.<br/>\nWhat concerns me (other than having him say he is bored whenever the action<br/>\nstops!) is that I feel being able to entertain oneself or spend time in<br/>\nsolitude is an important facet to be developed in each of us. My two older<br/>\nchildren rarely even considered being bored - always able to pick up a<br/>\nbook, a blank journal, a musical instrument, a basket of legos, whatever -<br/>\nand be engaged. They both seem to be more &quot;balanced&quot; in being able to spend<br/>\ntime alone/time with others. Bay is engaged mostly with other people (any<br/>\nage or sex or size will do!) or in movement (skateboarding, trampoline<br/>\njumping, surfing, dirt biking, yard work etc) . . . preferably both people<br/>\nand movement at the same time! I might mention that the only other major<br/>\nthing that will keep his interest is being read to or listening to a story<br/>\ntape . . . which he will do for hours. So, consequently, Bay&#39;s learning<br/>\ntakes the shape of . . . weed whack the property or ride a friend&#39;s dirt<br/>\nbike or fix it, or surf, or listen to story tapes or bake cookies with Nell<br/>\n(his older sister), or jump on the trampoline, or listen to pop music, or<br/>\ndraw while listening to music, or complain that all his friends are in<br/>\nschool and there is no one to play with, or invent games with Sky (his<br/>\nolder brother), or try to master the typing program on the computer, or<br/>\nwatch &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy,&quot; or count his money from his various jobs<br/>\nto see if he has enough to buy his own dirt bike,  or skateboard, or jump<br/>\non the pogo-stick, or watch Mary Martin in Peter Pan for the 12th time or<br/>\netc. Now, I know, in my heart, that this IS learning - but, still there are<br/>\nthose pauses between activity that always bring the same &quot;Mom, what can I<br/>\ndo?&quot; whine/lament. . . which makes my teeth itch! I can make suggestions<br/>\ngalore - but usually it is not met with acceptance. . . unless someone else<br/>\ngets involved. Is this rambling doing anyone any good, except me?! So, I,<br/>\ntoo - am interested in what responses we get on this precious list to Joy&#39;s<br/>\npost. By the way, I had pondered the possibility that Bay was inclined this<br/>\nway because of having two older siblings at home, and a home with three<br/>\nhome businesses and lots of action constantly. . . but here Joy is with a<br/>\nson without that and the same mantra!?<br/>\nThank you all for this thought-provoking and caring list.<br/>\nLove, Lee<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Organic Family Farm & Tropical B&B Cottages<br/>\n        . . . an eco-tourism destination . . . <br/>\nP.O.
