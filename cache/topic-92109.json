We sort of <br/>\n&quot;fell into&quot; unschooling, but I didn&#39;t have much info about it and <br/>\nwas kind of lost and lonely. After doing it for one year, I <br/>\n(mistakenly) put her back into school where she is right now. <br/>\nShe has asked to be homeschooled again, but wants to finish <br/>\nthe year, so we are going to homeschool her starting in May. I <br/>\nam very excited about it and after some extensive research, have <br/>\ndecided to unschool again. This time I have read Holt and Gatto <br/>\nand hooked up with you guys and other groups on line. I am <br/>\nhoping for better success this time and am commited to this <br/>\nlong term! I also have a 4 year old who is in preschool and I will <br/>\nbe pulling him out as well. One of the reasons I put my dd back <br/>\nin school is that I decided to return to College for my BA, but I <br/>\nhave found the classes less than satisfactory because we <br/>\nfrantically write notes only to memorize and regurgetate the info <br/>\non the tests. I have decided to look into a correspondence <br/>\nprogram to become a naturopath, but I am nervous whether this <br/>\nwill conflict with my ability to be available to my kids when they <br/>\nneed me.<br/>\nAny comments or advice is welcome (be gentle though please!)<br/>\nGreat to be here!<br/>\nDenise Thomas</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92095,"nextTopicId":92112}}
