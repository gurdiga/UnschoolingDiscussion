I put things in them periodically.  They<br/>\ncontain my children&#39;s baby books, some hospital polaroids which did not fit<br/>\nwell in the scrapbook, my toddlers first painting, a pair of tiny newborn<br/>\nbooties for each of them, and other special things.  I have lots of room<br/>\nleft for adding things over the years, and it takes many more types of<br/>\nthings than a scrapbook.  In fact, it holds their scrapbooks too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4721,"nextTopicId":4726}}
