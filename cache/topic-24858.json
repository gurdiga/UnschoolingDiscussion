He generally makes friends with everyone.  In one, a <br/>\nChinese friend had been lost in an airplane crash, and he risked his <br/>\nlife to go and find out if the friend survived the crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a great opportunity to discuss the changes in this world <br/>\nsince WWII.  &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; was quite comical, considering <br/>\nit was done in the late 40s/early 50s, before man ever set foot on <br/>\nthe moon.  Their &quot;predictions&quot; of what would happen were funny <br/>\ncompared with the facts we now have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe animated violence is like any other cartoon, and less than you <br/>\nsee on most TV shows these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY only objection to it is his friend, the Captain, who is also a <br/>\ndrunk with a temper.  He is a comical character most of the time, but <br/>\nwhen his temper lets loose, he lets go a bunch of &quot;curses&quot; - they&#39;re <br/>\nnot true swearing, but &quot;blistering barnacles&quot; and the like. I usually <br/>\ndon&#39;t read them all aloud.<br/>\n<br/>\nTintin is a good character model, as I said, often risking his life <br/>\nfor his friends.  He fights for the underdog, is very polite, and as <br/>\na character is probably in his early 20s.
