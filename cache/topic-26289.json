I think I will change how I am<br/>\nlooking at the situation.  I really don&#39;t care about &quot;age&quot; per se (one thing<br/>\nkarate has taught me is how to relate better as equals with kids), but<br/>\nphysical and mental ability to handle the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to remember that I have never taught homeschoolers before, only<br/>\nps kids whose parents paid a tremendous amount of money for them to take<br/>\nclasses so the kids couldn&#39;t quit if they wanted to.  Of course, all these<br/>\nkids are &quot;school at homers&quot; but there does seem to be increased flexibility<br/>\nwith the parents.
