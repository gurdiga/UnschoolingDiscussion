Marsie (5) wants to be able to stay by herself but<br/>\nI have been having to tell her no because it is a drive to get anywhere from<br/>\nhere.  I had never thought of when we go on walks (up our couple of block<br/>\nlong road with very little traffic) or when I am out in the barn in the<br/>\nmornings (within hollering distance) that I often do leave her alone if she<br/>\nisn&#39;t interested in joining in.  I hadn&#39;t thought of it as us &quot;going<br/>\nanywhere&quot;.  Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49339,"nextTopicId":49293}}
