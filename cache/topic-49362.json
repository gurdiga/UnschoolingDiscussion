If a Hindu or<br/>\npagan or even a nonfundamentalist Christian shares how their beliefs are<br/>\nincorporated into their lives then it comes across as no different than<br/>\nsomeone sharing how their culture is incorporated into their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the sharing of other religions comes across differently to<br/>\nfundamentalist Christians. I&#39;ve heard the grousing from fundamentalists that<br/>\nother religions can share but (fundamentalist) Christians can&#39;t so maybe to<br/>\nfundamentalists it feels like other religions are being shoved at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the huge difference is that other religions don&#39;t have the mandate to<br/>\nproselytize. People of other religions are just sharing what their life<br/>\nlooks like with no pressure to help people see how their way of life is<br/>\nright and the rest of the world is wrong. They don&#39;t have a mandate to tell<br/>\nother people what decisions they should be making about their lives or<br/>\nthoughts the Buddhist is no different than discussing it with<br/>\na Jew. They may each look to their religions for help on clarifying their<br/>\nthoughts but the conclusions they come to are not dictated by their<br/>\nreligious teachings. Discussing abortion -- or age of the earth, or family<br/>\nstructure, or environmentalism, or just about anything else! -- with a<br/>\nfundamentalist Christian is discussing religion. The views come straight<br/>\nfrom the Bible. (Often with quotes!) That&#39;s not a criticism. It just is as<br/>\nit is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe viewpoint of a Hindu is not a Hindu viewpoint. A viewpoint of a<br/>\nfundamentalist Christian *is* a Christian viewpoint. They are one and the<br/>\nsame so any discussion that is based on Biblical viewpoints is going to look<br/>\na lot like proselytizing to many people.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the general feeling that Christians can&#39;t speak up is pretty accurate.<br/>\nI&#39;m not seeing a way around that because the viewpoint of a fundamentalist<br/>\nis a religious viewpoint. Well, one way around it is for someone to give up<br/>\ntheir fundamentalist beliefs so they can express a nonreligious viewpoint! I<br/>\nsuspect that&#39;s not a trade most fundamentalists want to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if someone wants to discuss how to reconcile fundamentalist Christianity<br/>\nwith unscholing, that&#39;s within the paramaters of an unschooling list. But<br/>\nit&#39;s a nonreligious list and religion of any kind can&#39;t be a foundation for<br/>\ndecisons on what unschooling is or dictate how it&#39;s discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49369,"nextTopicId":49376}}
