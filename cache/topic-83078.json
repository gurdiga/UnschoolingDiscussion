In that tragic case, <br/>\nthe children&#39;s parents had been under investigation for abuse <br/>\nand neglect and were not abiding by the state&#39;s home school <br/>\nlaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Hal Young, president of North Carolinians for Home <br/>\nEducation (nche.com), says CBS News overlooked certain <br/>\nimportant facts in its coverage of the story. According to Young, <br/>\nif parents commit monstrous acts against a child, there are <br/>\nlaws in place to deal with that situation. He says educational <br/>\nregulation is not meant to be a tool for social services or for <br/>\ndealing with criminal activity.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;By highlighting criminal cases that supposedly had a <br/>\nconnection to home educators, CBS News is trying to create <br/>\na linkage there to adapt the laws, adapt the regulations, to <br/>\ndo something they are not intended to do,&quot; he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nYoung was interviewed for the &quot;Eye on America&quot; news report. <br/>\nDuring that interview, he says, the reporters went over the <br/>\nsame questions several times, and it became apparent that <br/>\nCBS had only one objective in producing the report: to portray <br/>\nhome education as a haven for potential child abusers and <br/>\nworse.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When they came to speak with me, I think they already had <br/>\ntheir story planned and outlined. I&#39;d have to say it was <br/>\nobvious where the story was going,&quot; the home education <br/>\nadvocate says, adding, &quot;I believe CBS already had a plan <br/>\nin mind, and their contact with us was mainly to gather a <br/>\nfew sound bites.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CBS Evening News, which is hosted by veteran news <br/>\nanchor Dan Rather, has several high-profile sponsors, <br/>\nincluding Cingular Wireless, Honda, Arby&#39;s, Philip Morris, <br/>\nand Wal-Mart. Young says in order to hold the network to a <br/>\nhigher standard of journalistic integrity, families and <br/>\nindividuals should contact CBS, its affiliates, and advertisers <br/>\nto express their concerns about the CBS Evening News <br/>\nand its anti-home-schooling coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~ ~~ ~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83083,"nextTopicId":83072}}
