Does anyone know if they manufacture an umbrella <br/>\nstroller over here that has two adjsutable knobs on the side that <br/>\nallows the whole seat part to be inclined at whatever angle you <br/>\nchoose? I had a double one of these when my first two were little & <br/>\nit was awesome as you could lay them flat or any degree of <br/>\nuprightness you wanted. <br/>\nWe recently purchased a Jogger, via the internet, thinking that we <br/>\nhad done our research pretty thoroughly. This jogger, which is really <br/>\nnice, was supposed to be fully reclinable. We thought &quot;Fully <br/>\nreclinable&quot; meant just that, but obviously not as this thing only <br/>\nreclines so far & is absolutely unsuitable for a newborn. I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to spend a huge amount of money on another stroller as the <br/>\njogger will be great once he is 2-3mths old. Can&#39;t use a sling or <br/>\nSnugli for a long period of time due to back problems & because we <br/>\nlive out in the &quot;boonies&quot; of WV probably won&#39;t use it a great deal. <br/>\nJust want something that we can take to the park or mall etc.<br/>\nAny ideas or suggestions would be welcome.<br/>\nThanks <br/>\nLiz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57872,"nextTopicId":57654}}
