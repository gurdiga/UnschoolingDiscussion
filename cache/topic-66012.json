May be short or long depending on the amount of damage <br/>\nthat was done to the child in the school system (the adult, too---many adults <br/>\nhave a harder/longer time deschooling to get to unschooling!). Not much <br/>\nlearning is &quot;visible&quot; as the child is learning to love learning again.<br/>\n<br/>\nUNschooling is when the freedom takes hold and the learning starts. It&#39;s when <br/>\nthe peace and wholeness and joy are visible again---when you can see that <br/>\nspark in their eyes that all five year olds have! It&#39;s when they start asking <br/>\nquestions again and enjoying life again. It&#39;s beautiful!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one that had to deschool and one that will never see a school.

That way they could see the learning that happens during <br/>\n&quot;break&quot; (and be sure to casually point it out every day!).
