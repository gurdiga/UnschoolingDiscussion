Our responsibility as unschoolers of providing opportunities <br/>\n  and resources extends to far more than providing software and books. Real <br/>\n  life is more than that. Providing resources also means giving them access to <br/>\n  opportunities and people and places. Buying stuff is easy by comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n  **Nice clean <br/>\n<br/>\n  cadavers are much preferable to stinky squashed animals and there will be <br/>\n<br/>\n  time for that when and if she gets to medical school or if she still wants to <br/>\n<br/>\n  do that.  After all I doubt you get any extra consideration because your mom <br/>\n<br/>\n  brought roadkill home for you.**<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s not about getting consideration for getting into medical school. It&#39;s <br/>\n  about having opportunities right now to explore whether or not this is <br/>\n  actually something the child is interested in. For most people, finding out <br/>\n  in medical school that having to deal with real bleeding sick bodies is NOT <br/>\n  what they want to do is WAY TOO LATE. They&#39;ve already invested so much time <br/>\n  and money and energy in the pursuit of being &quot;a doctor&quot; that they just can&#39;t <br/>\n  bring themselves to quit at that point. <br/>\n<br/>\n  It doesn&#39;t have to be roadkill, but the point is that &quot;getting ready for med <br/>\n  school&quot; should be more about exploring the idea of being a doctor at this <br/>\n  point, and less about specific requirements. When a child has had opportunity <br/>\n  to really see what a specific career is about and wants to pursue it they <br/>\n  usually have motivation to do whatever they need to do to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the other hand, often kids settle on saying &quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; or <br/>\n  &quot;teacher&quot; when asked about career goals because they know those answers will <br/>\n  be &quot;good enough&quot; to satisfy the questioner and they won&#39;t have to answer a <br/>\n  lot more questions about the matter, where &quot;historian&quot; or &quot;gamer&quot; or &quot;writer&quot; <br/>\n  will get them questions and comments about practicality etc. Especially if <br/>\n  they live in families where at least one of their parents believes that the <br/>\n  only possibilities are college on the one hand and living at home forever on <br/>\n  the other hand. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorry, meant to write more, and softer. Maybe later. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo! Groups Sponsor <br/>\n       <br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

She&#39;s <br/>\nseen some pretty sad things.  This same doctor has been &quot;many&quot; things as a <br/>\ndoctor and is currently an Internist but he&#39;s been a missionary doctor in <br/>\nAfrica, a soccer player in England, oh the list goes on and on and he&#39;s very <br/>\nwilling to share with Cait his experiences and allow her the freedom of <br/>\nexploring his world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other equally good resources I am sure.
