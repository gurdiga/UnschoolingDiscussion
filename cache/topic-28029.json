More as her partner in her discovery of the world rather<br/>\n&gt; than her leader or trainer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What are your reasons for having a set bedtime? What do you fear will<br/>\nhappen<br/>\n&gt; if she stays up as late as she wants?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some parents who like an hour or two alone together in the evening say it<br/>\n&gt; works well if they suggest a time the kids head to their rooms to read or<br/>\n&gt; listen to tapes or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can suggest it, but I suspect at 3 1/2 she won&#39;t want to be alone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you give her freedom, be prepared for her to run wild with it. She&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; disregard how tired she is and want to stay up as late as possible. (Same<br/>\n&gt; with anything that&#39;s been controlled and restricted.) Eventually she&#39;ll<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt; back in touch with how her body feels and know she doesn&#39;t have to grasp<br/>\nas<br/>\n&gt; much night as she can before it&#39;s controlled again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manners, being responsible, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How long does it actually take to learn manners? People seem to think it<br/>\n&gt; takes 18 full years of training ;-) But if we treat them the way we&#39;d like<br/>\n&gt; them to treat us and others, then they&#39;ll learn. They&#39;ll want others to<br/>\nfeel<br/>\n&gt; as nice as our being respectful does to them. (It will take some kids<br/>\nlonger<br/>\n&gt; than others.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behavior....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Probably not the sole cause, but I bet it&#39;s a good part of it. I suspect<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; weren&#39;t as engaged with her as you had been. Kids are sensitive to moods<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; the way they react isn&#39;t necessarily how we expect them to. As others<br/>\nsaid,<br/>\n&gt; she was also discovering something new, exploring something heretofor<br/>\n&gt; restricted. I also remember my daughter at 2 wanted to watch 101<br/>\nDalmations<br/>\n&gt; over and over and over in a day, so there&#39;s the age factor.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But is an adverse reaction really a bad thing? Isn&#39;t that our body&#39;s way<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; talking to us? And isn&#39;t ignoring it part of mastering our bodies? If she<br/>\n&gt; never gets to experience those feelings how will she learn to recognize it<br/>\n&gt; when her body is saying it needs a change of pace?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you see her getting cranky or whatever, you can suggest a new activity<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s better than TV like a trip to the playground or the store or doing<br/>\n&gt; something with you in the house. She may turn it down, but offer<br/>\n&gt; periodically (not nag) so she has the opportunity to experience how<br/>\n&gt; something new affects her body. She may need to watch for a while. She may<br/>\n&gt; need several opportunities doing something different to see the<br/>\nconnection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she watches?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you think she&#39;d watch if you didn&#39;t restrict? What effects do you<br/>\n&gt; think they&#39;d have on her?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daughter can watch anything she wants and she chooses what interests<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt; and what she feels comfortable with which isn&#39;t beyond the bounds of what<br/>\nI<br/>\n&gt; would have chosen for her. (Well, asthetically speaking I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; choose Ed, Edd and Eddie ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You, of course, do have a &quot;say&quot; since you won&#39;t be taking her into an<br/>\nadult<br/>\n&gt; video store to pick something out, but you probably won&#39;t send her down<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; grownup drama aisle either. But not because they would be bad for her but<br/>\n&gt; just because they&#39;d bore her silly. (Though my daughter was fascinated by<br/>\n&gt; all 3 hours of Dances with Wolves at 5 or 6 so you never know!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So your &quot;say&quot; is to help her find the types of things that would interest<br/>\n&gt; her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Or do I have to wait<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Quite frankly there rarely are natural consequences to the kids for<br/>\navoiding<br/>\n&gt; chores. Do kids care if the living room floor can&#39;t be walked through? Do<br/>\n&gt; they care if the toilet or tub is dirty? Do they care if there aren&#39;t any<br/>\n&gt; clean dishes in the house? (They&#39;d probably, rightly from their point of<br/>\n&gt; view, suggest paper plates ;-) From *their* point of view it makes a lot<br/>\n&gt; more sense if the toys are kept out where they can easily be played with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kids *do* have different points of view. The things they care about *are*<br/>\n&gt; different. We don&#39;t need to train them to care. Time will take care of<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; -- *if* you&#39;re thinking of them taking care of themselves as adults. If<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re thinking of them caring about how the house looks, don&#39;t hold your<br/>\n&gt; breath ;-) We *think* we provide them with a home and they should care<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s upkeep. But we don&#39;t. We provide them with what *we* want to give<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s ours, not theirs. If it was theirs, they&#39;d get a say in how it was<br/>\n&gt; decorated and what state of cleanliness (or not) was acceptable.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If you help them pick up, if you ask for help (and allow one of the<br/>\nanswers<br/>\n&gt; to be no thanks without anger), kids will pitch in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As for their rooms, would you want your daughter deciding when you should<br/>\n&gt; clean your room and to what state of cleanliness? It might be cute the<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n&gt; time ;-) but it would get old pretty quick. Especially if you didn&#39;t see<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; reason for the standards she was imposing. When you feel the urge to clean<br/>\n&gt; it you can ask her if she doesn&#39;t mind if you straighten up. If she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to help, I bet she will at least for a while.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and<br/>\nprovide<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s helpful to see this as something you want to give to your<br/>\n&gt; family not something that they are asking for and must have. They will<br/>\n&gt; survive on junk. You want to offer take the time and effort to offer them<br/>\n&gt; something better. If you talk about why you make the choices you do rather<br/>\n&gt; than why your daughter needs to eat in such and such a way -- as it sounds<br/>\n&gt; like you do -- then she&#39;ll understand the reasoning behind your choices.<br/>\n&gt; That won&#39;t necessarily mean she&#39;ll agree for herself. She might need to<br/>\ntry<br/>\n&gt; things out for her self. (That&#39;s the heart of unschooling anyway ;-) But<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s a difference between freely exploring and rebelling from control.<br/>\n&gt; The second is often done not because the child necessarily wants to but<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s forbidden.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are your reasons for having a set bedtime? What do you fear will happen<br/>\nif she stays up as late as she wants?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents who like an hour or two alone together in the evening say it<br/>\nworks well if they suggest a time the kids head to their rooms to read or<br/>\nlisten to tapes or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can suggest it, but I suspect at 3 1/2 she won&#39;t want to be alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you give her freedom, be prepared for her to run wild with it. She&#39;ll<br/>\ndisregard how tired she is and want to stay up as late as possible. (Same<br/>\nwith anything that&#39;s been controlled and restricted.) Eventually she&#39;ll get<br/>\nback in touch with how her body feels and know she doesn&#39;t have to grasp as<br/>\nmuch night as she can before it&#39;s controlled again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>\n&gt; manners, being responsible, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How long does it actually take to learn manners? People seem to think it<br/>\ntakes 18 full years of training ;-) But if we treat them the way we&#39;d like<br/>\nthem to treat us and others, then they&#39;ll learn. They&#39;ll want others to feel<br/>\nas nice as our being respectful does to them. (It will take some kids longer<br/>\nthan others.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>\n&gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>\n&gt; behavior....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably not the sole cause, but I bet it&#39;s a good part of it. I suspect you<br/>\nweren&#39;t as engaged with her as you had been. Kids are sensitive to moods and<br/>\nthe way they react isn&#39;t necessarily how we expect them to. As others said,<br/>\nshe was also discovering something new, exploring something heretofor<br/>\nrestricted. I also remember my daughter at 2 wanted to watch 101 Dalmations<br/>\nover and over and over in a day, so there&#39;s the age factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is an adverse reaction really a bad thing? Isn&#39;t that our body&#39;s way of<br/>\ntalking to us? And isn&#39;t ignoring it part of mastering our bodies? If she<br/>\nnever gets to experience those feelings how will she learn to recognize it<br/>\nwhen her body is saying it needs a change of pace?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see her getting cranky or whatever, you can suggest a new activity<br/>\nthat&#39;s better than TV like a trip to the playground or the store or doing<br/>\nsomething with you in the house. She may turn it down, but offer<br/>\nperiodically (not nag) so she has the opportunity to experience how<br/>\nsomething new affects her body. She may need to watch for a while. She may<br/>\nneed several opportunities doing something different to see the connection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>\n&gt; she watches?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you think she&#39;d watch if you didn&#39;t restrict? What effects do you<br/>\nthink they&#39;d have on her?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter can watch anything she wants and she chooses what interests her<br/>\nand what she feels comfortable with which isn&#39;t beyond the bounds of what I<br/>\nwould have chosen for her. (Well, asthetically speaking I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>\nchoose Ed, Edd and Eddie ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou, of course, do have a &quot;say&quot; since you won&#39;t be taking her into an adult<br/>\nvideo store to pick something out, but you probably won&#39;t send her down the<br/>\ngrownup drama aisle either. But not because they would be bad for her but<br/>\njust because they&#39;d bore her silly. (Though my daughter was fascinated by<br/>\nall 3 hours of Dances with Wolves at 5 or 6 so you never know!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo your &quot;say&quot; is to help her find the types of things that would interest<br/>\nher. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or do I have to wait<br/>\n&gt; for &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Quite frankly there rarely are natural consequences to the kids for avoiding<br/>\nchores. Do kids care if the living room floor can&#39;t be walked through? Do<br/>\nthey care if the toilet or tub is dirty? Do they care if there aren&#39;t any<br/>\nclean dishes in the house? (They&#39;d probably, rightly from their point of<br/>\nview, suggest paper plates ;-) From *their* point of view it makes a lot<br/>\nmore sense if the toys are kept out where they can easily be played with.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *do* have different points of view. The things they care about *are*<br/>\ndifferent. We don&#39;t need to train them to care. Time will take care of that<br/>\n-- *if* you&#39;re thinking of them taking care of themselves as adults. If<br/>\nyou&#39;re thinking of them caring about how the house looks, don&#39;t hold your<br/>\nbreath ;-) We *think* we provide them with a home and they should care about<br/>\nit&#39;s upkeep. But we don&#39;t. We provide them with what *we* want to give them.<br/>\nIt&#39;s ours, not theirs. If it was theirs, they&#39;d get a say in how it was<br/>\ndecorated and what state of cleanliness (or not) was acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you help them pick up, if you ask for help (and allow one of the answers<br/>\nto be no thanks without anger), kids will pitch in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for their rooms, would you want your daughter deciding when you should<br/>\nclean your room and to what state of cleanliness? It might be cute the first<br/>\ntime ;-) but it would get old pretty quick. Especially if you didn&#39;t see the<br/>\nreason for the standards she was imposing. When you feel the urge to clean<br/>\nit you can ask her if she doesn&#39;t mind if you straighten up. If she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to help, I bet she will at least for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>\n&gt; for our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>\n&gt; this!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s helpful to see this as something you want to give to your<br/>\nfamily not something that they are asking for and must have. They will<br/>\nsurvive on junk. You want to offer take the time and effort to offer them<br/>\nsomething better. If you talk about why you make the choices you do rather<br/>\nthan why your daughter needs to eat in such and such a way -- as it sounds<br/>\nlike you do -- then she&#39;ll understand the reasoning behind your choices.<br/>\nThat won&#39;t necessarily mean she&#39;ll agree for herself. She might need to try<br/>\nthings out for her self. (That&#39;s the heart of unschooling anyway ;-) But<br/>\nthere&#39;s a difference between freely exploring and rebelling from control.<br/>\nThe second is often done not because the child necessarily wants to but just<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s forbidden.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Lucie Caunter","from":"&quot;Lucie Caunter&quot; &lt;lucie.caunter@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vtec9aeO0KDep34K5PB1tN2koP9_P5QUdvVYrnCfHCB-unp_VwFbCvU-TsqJeVmlgf3IkpXE2iFPZ_6UWXrYoeiG0fDdSetEOrkWAsWL-s05TNc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: unschooling vs. unparenting","postDate":"1006284258","msgId":28124,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxODMwMWMxNzFmYSQwZWIyMThjMCQ2NTc5ZTJkMUBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDExMTIwLjA2MzQzMC4tOTU3NDAxLjMuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+IDwwMDY1MDFjMTcxZGIkODUxZjkyZTAkMDgyNmZjOWVAcGF2aWxpb24+IDwwMDcwMDFjMTcxZGMkMDQ5MWVhYTAkMDgyNmZjOWVAcGF2aWxpb24+"},"prevInTopic":28123,"nextInTopic":28125,"prevInTime":28123,"nextInTime":28125,"topicId":28029,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think it is wrong to limit the amount of candy anyone would eat in one sitting?

In the aftermath of that<br/>\n&gt; event<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half hour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to engage<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d<br/>\nwalk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch tv.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Prior to this she&#39;d have gotten engaged in any number of things...from<br/>\n&gt; water<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play, to toys, to books, etc.  Her imagination seemed to be put on hold.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Her behavior also changed.  She was suddenly unable to cope with<br/>\neveryday<br/>\n&gt; &gt; minor things...they&#39;d throw her into a tailspin....she also became<br/>\n&gt; &gt; uncooperative (alright, maybe we were asking her to do a chore...).  I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; amazed to see the changes in her and I considered them negative<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changes....so soon after we went back to limited video viewing and her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; imagination seemed to kick in again.  But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she wants....  (Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behavior....)  And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in<br/>\n&gt; what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she watches?  She&#39;s 3 1/2, btw.  And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up a<br/>\n&gt; piece<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?

I work really hard to<br/>\ndo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this!   DD usually (unless the day is out of control altogether) gets to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; decide what she wants for breakfast, lunch, and snacks from what we have<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the house.  On occasion she decides dinner and/or will make dessert.<br/>\nShe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; has a bagel...everyday almost.  She has grilled cheese....everyday<br/>\nalmost.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She gets up on the counter and looks in the cabinets or in the fridge<br/>\nfor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; snacks/drinks.  She can select anything....all of it is fairly to very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healthy.  She and her dad go for doughnuts on Saturday mornings as a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; treat....they also share twizzlers from time to time.  I did restrict<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal<br/>\n&lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.

At our house though some of us don&#39;t<br/>\ngo to bed when we are tired....we stay up on the computer or reading or<br/>\nwatching TV &lt;gasp, smile&gt; and need someone to urge us into bed.  If she&#39;s<br/>\nreally into something and wants to, she can stay up a little longer and we<br/>\njust turn off the light at the same time...so it&#39;s like trading the in bed<br/>\nreading/playing time for whatever she was doing.

OTOH, I have<br/>\n&gt; asked her to bring her dishes into the kitchen, or to make a &quot;dish run&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and round up any other dishes left in the living room, or carry a basket<br/>\n&gt; full of laundry to the bedroom since she&#39;s going there... and she rarely<br/>\n&gt; says no and if so, there&#39;s a good reason.

In the aftermath of  that<br/>\n&gt; event<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>\n&gt; &gt; before...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half hour<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to<br/>\n&gt; engage in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; activities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; walk<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tv.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Do you think that that might have had more to do with your being in a<br/>\n&gt; state of grief and perhaps less available than formerly? Ah, wait, I see<br/>\n&gt; that you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>\n&gt; sense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>\n&gt; self-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>\n&gt; than one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>\n&gt; often stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>\n&gt; that they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>\n&gt; Freedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.  Could be it.  Maybe if it had continued she would have turned them off<br/>\nherself.  I&#39;m not sure why I blame the TV solely...as I said to Sandra...I<br/>\nmight not be willing to admit that grief got in the way....that I wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&#39;there&#39; for her...  But, it was a very interesting time...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It also sounds like pretty typical 1 1/2 yr old developmental stuff,<br/>\n&gt; especially is you were starting to expect her to do chores at that age.<br/>\n&gt; :-/<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh!  I think you have the wrong picture here....chores is a very broad<br/>\nword....  I wasn&#39;t asking her to chop wood (we heat with it) or make her bed<br/>\nso I could bounce a quarter off it!  It was (what I consider)<br/>\ndevelopmentally appropriate stuff...like, here Em, help mommy put away all<br/>\nyour sand toys back in the sand box before we go back inside....  She&#39;d<br/>\nthrow herself on the ground and scream during the TV binge time and hadn&#39;t<br/>\ndone that prior to it.  Yes, yes, yes...there could have been other<br/>\ninfluences, coincidentally occuring at the same time....  But, don&#39;t think<br/>\nshe had a chore list and I was freaking out because she wasn&#39;t doing them<br/>\nwhile saying &quot;Yes, m&#39;am&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; And you never ask your kids to pick  up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up  a<br/>\n&gt; piece<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room<br/>\n&gt; floor and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; walks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sure you can ask, as long as it&#39;s asking and not commanding. Often people<br/>\n&gt; say ask when they mean command. Asking implies that the answer could be<br/>\n&gt; no...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ask means ask for me.  Commands are only used in emergency safety<br/>\nissues...like &quot;STOP!&quot; when she runs at top speed along the top of the<br/>\nplayground equipment toward the unprotected edge over which she&#39;d drop to<br/>\ncertain injury....used very rarely and mostly during that scarey time when<br/>\nshe could walk and run all over but had no sense of what would happen if she<br/>\nplummeted....  We generally think it&#39;s better to fall out of tree and break<br/>\nan arm than to never climb a tree...but we do have some limits to this.<br/>\nAnyway, yes, generally she&#39;s asked...sometimes, if I need the house picked<br/>\nup (so I can impress people with how clean it is, as if no one actually<br/>\nlives here) then it&#39;s less negotiable....but I always help her if it&#39;s<br/>\npossible and she wants help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We have always talked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about healthy v. non healthy foods.  It&#39;s OK to eat non healthy foods,<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not all the time...it&#39;s the healthy foods that help us grow and stay<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fit. It was wrong to say this?  It&#39;s the truth (as I see it...you may<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disagree)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s a kind of simplistic truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but it worked really well when she was 1 1/2.  We do talk more now<br/>\nabout energy levels, but we haven&#39;t reached the point of researching carbs.<br/>\nShe&#39;s only 3 1/2 and it&#39;s really not a big issue for her.  She gets the junk<br/>\nat her granparents&#39; or friends&#39; houses and occasionally at ours or at a<br/>\nrestaurant.  She doesn&#39;t have to beg for stuff so it&#39;s just not a big deal.<br/>\nShe knows grandma susie has the sweet cereal and at home she always asks for<br/>\na bagel (multigrain/organic....but she doesn&#39;t know that, she just knows she<br/>\nlikes them).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also noticed that she tends to get emotionally<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; overwrought more easily if she hasn&#39;t had food in a while, especially<br/>\n&gt; protein... my brother was like this as a kid, so I&#39;m a little familiar<br/>\n&gt; with it, although I can go a day without eating and not feel any ill<br/>\n&gt; effects.So, I&#39;ve spent years now trying to point out the connection and<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s pretty good now about grabbing some food when she&#39;s feeling that<br/>\n&gt; way... of course, it&#39;s not a sure thing, sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat for<br/>\n&gt; hours and is fine, but if she does feel sad for no reason it&#39;s often a<br/>\n&gt; clue..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes!

When real life isn&#39;t fun and<br/>\ninteresting, then TV viewing can go up and up.  The extra viewing can squeeze<br/>\nother things out of life temporarily.  This isn&#39;t great, but I don&#39;t think a<br/>\nmom should beat herself up if she is busy grieving or ill or healing and her<br/>\nkids watch &quot;too much&quot; TV.  I hope a parent in this situation would be gentle to<br/>\nherself and agonize as little as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the advice that&#39;s often given in this forum, about kids being able to<br/>\nself-regulated their viewing, is intended for normal to good life<br/>\ncircumstances.

I think <br/>\nyou need to do what works best for you and your family.  On the other hand, <br/>\nI&#39;ve changed my attitude toward some of these things (like TV) as a result <br/>\nof these discussions, so keeping an open mind is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like you&#39;re asking permission.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a lot that goes into the bedtime decision.  Some kids tend <br/>\nto go to sleep when they get tired.  I actually had *one* like that.  Other <br/>\nkids get wound up and cranky when they get tired, but fight sleep as if it <br/>\nwere the enemy.  I think those kids need to be treated a bit differently in <br/>\nterms of the bedtime thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a mother&#39;s sanity is pretty important to her kids.  Many mothers <br/>\ndon&#39;t keep their sanity well if they don&#39;t get some alone or <br/>\nalone-with-hubby time at the end of the day.  I think it&#39;s to their kids&#39; <br/>\nadvantage if the mother gets that time, one way or another.  Some mothers <br/>\ndon&#39;t specify a bedtime so much as a time for everyone being reasonably <br/>\nquiet and in their own space (or at least out of the parent&#39;s space).  And <br/>\nthen there comes a time when your kid will want to stay up later than <br/>\nyou.  I fought the idea with my youngest (now 14), thinking that I *had* to <br/>\nhave that time after everyone went to bed to do my writing.  My son was <br/>\npersistent and I finally realized that I could do my writing in the morning <br/>\njust as well as at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if you&#39;re paying attention to your child&#39;s needs and wants, <br/>\nand trying to make sure that all of their needs and at least some of their <br/>\nwants get met, one way or another, you&#39;re being a responsible parent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And<br/>\n&gt;chores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child asks to be<br/>\n&gt;excused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all of this I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt;take and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot; gasp<br/>\n&gt;again!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot; , it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt;&#39;bad&#39; thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Being polite is a bad thing?  &lt;g&gt;  I guess the reaction to that one would <br/>\ndepend on what happens if the child doesn&#39;t do what was asked.  When Lars <br/>\nwas younger, we didn&#39;t insist on any chores.  He loved helping us, and we <br/>\nfelt we got more of a contribution to the work of the family by *not* <br/>\nassigning chores.  Then he got older.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he has *one* regular after-dinner clean-up chore.  He is *asked* to do <br/>\nother things, like chopping kindling and bringing in firewood, because <br/>\nthese things are very difficult and painful for me.  And Dad is working <br/>\nreally hard and I don&#39;t want him to have to do it when he comes home.  Lars <br/>\nis pretty reasonable about doing these things.  It&#39;s a compromise that <br/>\nworks for our family.  We&#39;re very flexible, though.  When Lars was working <br/>\nwith his dad full time for a few weeks, he was just too bagged at the end <br/>\nof the day to do his cleanup chore.  So I did it.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So much of what I learned and the way I was brought up has to<br/>\n&gt;be thrown out the window....stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>\n&gt;manners, being responsible, etc.  (My mom decided hair length on my<br/>\n&gt;college-aged brother.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yikes!

Do I get any say in what<br/>\n&gt;she watches?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There you go, asking permission again.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAgain, listen to what everyone is saying, but make up your mind according <br/>\nto what will work for you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>\n&gt;their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?

If she leaves them there, they obviously don&#39;t bother <br/>\nher.  Personally, I don&#39;t have a problem with asking older kids to pick up <br/>\nafter themselves.  I&#39;d do the same if I had a messy adult roommate.  With <br/>\nlittle kids, it works a lot better to start picking up and ask them to do <br/>\nit with you.  Even if she only picks up one or two pieces, you could thank <br/>\nher for her help and point out how much nicer things look now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also figured out recently that if I just go ahead and clean up the house <br/>\nto a certain point, and keep putting other people&#39;s things where they <br/>\nbelong when they get left out, that the rest of the family starts to follow <br/>\nsuit after a while.  I always left other people&#39;s stuff where it was, and <br/>\ngot annoyed about the fact that they never seemed to notice it.

I think maybe what some people are saying <br/>\nabout the food issue is to not make it into almost a religion, a moral issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I did restrict<br/>\n&gt;Halloween candy....she could have two pieces after she at her meal &lt;gasp!&gt;<br/>\n&gt;but then the dog ate all the rest so that was that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope the dog was ok.

I think that if you just decided that one person <br/>\nhere was right and you were going to do everything &quot;her&quot; way (whichever <br/>\n&quot;her&quot; you chose) that you wouldn&#39;t be unschooling at all.  You&#39;d merely be <br/>\nfollowing &quot;her&quot; curriculum.  &lt;g&gt;  My advice would be to let go of the <br/>\nthings that you can see now are not important to control.

Ah, wait, I see<br/>\nthat you dismiss this idea farther down - but why?  It makes a lot of<br/>\nsense to me. It could also be part of the process of learning to<br/>\nself-regulate, like when kids who have never been allowed to eat more<br/>\nthan one piece of candy are suddenly able to eat all they want, they<br/>\noften stuff themselves silly, since that&#39;s what everyone has expected<br/>\nthat they will do all of their lives if they were given that freedom.<br/>\nFreedom often takes some getting used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also sounds like pretty typical 1 1/2 yr old developmental stuff,<br/>\nespecially is you were starting to expect her to do chores at that age.<br/>\n:-/<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And you never ask your kids to pick  up<br/>\n&gt; their mess or are you talking only about their rooms?

How about bedtimes?  Can I set the time she goes in?  And<br/>\nchores, you say no to those too...so after dinner, when my child asks to be<br/>\nexcused &lt;gasp!  still unlearning, still deciding what of all of this I&#39;ll<br/>\ntake and what I&#39;ll leave, but yes I did say &quot;asks to be excused&quot; gasp<br/>\nagain!&gt; and I say &quot;sure, please take your dishes in to the kitchen&quot; , it&#39;s a<br/>\n&#39;bad&#39; thing?  So much of what I learned and the way I was brought up has to<br/>\nbe thrown out the window....stuff I just thought was helping kids learn<br/>\nmanners, being responsible, etc.  (My mom decided hair length on my<br/>\ncollege-aged brother.)<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of questions/comments....<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a miscarriage in 99, my DD was 1 1/2.  In the aftermath of that event<br/>\nshe watched LOTS more tv (videos, we don&#39;t have cable) than ever<br/>\nbefore...she&#39;d watch a couple of hours a day, as opposed to a half hour<br/>\nevery couple of days.  I noticed a HUGE decline in her ability to engage in<br/>\nactivities herself.  She had never before been &#39;bored&#39; and now she&#39;d walk<br/>\naround the house, see nothing that interested her and ask to watch tv.<br/>\nPrior to this she&#39;d have gotten engaged in any number of things...from water<br/>\nplay, to toys, to books, etc.  Her imagination seemed to be put on hold.<br/>\nHer behavior also changed.  She was suddenly unable to cope with everyday<br/>\nminor things...they&#39;d throw her into a tailspin....she also became<br/>\nuncooperative (alright, maybe we were asking her to do a chore...).  I was<br/>\namazed to see the changes in her and I considered them negative<br/>\nchanges....so soon after we went back to limited video viewing and her<br/>\nimagination seemed to kick in again.  But, you&#39;re telling me that if she<br/>\nwants to watch videos, I should let her watch them...all day if that&#39;s what<br/>\nshe wants....  (Please don&#39;t write all of this off by saying that my<br/>\nemotional state could have been the sole cause of her changes in<br/>\nbehavior....)  And what about the types of videos?  Do I get any say in what<br/>\nshe watches?  She&#39;s 3 1/2, btw.  And you never ask your kids to pick up<br/>\ntheir mess or are you talking only about their rooms?  If DD cuts up a piece<br/>\nof paper into hundreds of tiny pieces of paper on the dining room floor and<br/>\nwalks away....can&#39;t I later ask her to pick them up?  Or do I have to wait<br/>\nfor &#39;natural&#39; consequences to kick in...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why is it a bad thing if we grow, raise, purchase, cook, and provide<br/>\nfor our family healthy, wholesome, organic foods? I work really hard to do<br/>\nthis!   DD usually (unless the day is out of control altogether) gets to<br/>\ndecide what she wants for breakfast, lunch, and snacks from what we have in<br/>\nthe house.  On occasion she decides dinner and/or will make dessert.  She<br/>\nhas a bagel...everyday almost.  She has grilled cheese....everyday almost.<br/>\nShe gets up on the counter and looks in the cabinets or in the fridge for<br/>\nsnacks/drinks.
