Learning became a task.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, he also left out a lot of information that I originally wrote<br/>\nto him.  I would have liked to see the reporter include more of the<br/>\ndetails that I sent him.  He had a tendency of summarizing some of my<br/>\ncomments.  For example, my kids do a lot more with other kids than just<br/>\npark day and team sports. I think that the details are really important<br/>\nwhen attempting to explain unschooling.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe also treated my children very politely and quite fairly especially<br/>\nwhen choosing Riley&#39;s quotes.  And, I laughed out loud at Riley&#39;s last<br/>\ncomment:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;My schooled friends&#39; opening question is usually, `What grade are you<br/>\nin?&#39;&quot; said Riley Brown. &quot;I tell them that I would be in the 7th grade,<br/>\nbut it really doesn&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t usually try to explain because<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t get it if I did.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nSadly, my son Casey was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t print<br/>\nanything that he said and he said some great stuff.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I wasn&#39;t impressed with the quotes he chose in opposition to<br/>\nunschooling.  They were pretty silly arguments especially the one about<br/>\nAmelia Earhart and Harriet Tubman. I am not sure that some of the people<br/>\nhe chose to quote in opposition to unschooling really understand<br/>\nunschooling.  But, I am also not surprised that he couldn&#39;t find a truly<br/>\nviable argument.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, since I still haven&#39;t actually seen the article, I am very curious<br/>\nwhich pictures they chose to print.  Originally, they wanted &quot;schooly&quot;<br/>\npictures.  The photographer spent four hours with us.  She learned quite<br/>\nquickly that she wasn&#39;t going to get &quot;schooly pictures (except of my<br/>\nkids reading).  She truly respected and seemed to understand why that<br/>\nwould not make sense.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere are so many people out there in the world that have never even<br/>\nheard the term unschooling so the reporter truly was faced with a<br/>\nchallenge.  Basically, I think that he made a good attempt to rise to<br/>\nthe challenge.  Maybe he missed a few things but for a newspaper<br/>\narticle, I was happy with it.  To truly understand unschooling, one<br/>\nlittle article is not going to do it.  But, maybe, just maybe, this<br/>\narticle introduced a concept just enough to get a few people interested.<br/>\nI think you need lots of books, experience, discussion lists, and time<br/>\nbefore anyone can truly understand unschooling.  I know that I did.  It<br/>\nsurely didn&#39;t happen with one article.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nDeanne<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Gradua\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Gradua</a><br/>\nte+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4<br/>\n=Middle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+educatio<br/>\nn+in+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=XeERtAmMH6xOclFlfF3kXw&gt;  school education<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mid<br/>\ndle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in<br/>\n+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=89oOLkTPWnhxf__b2u72QA&gt;  school education <br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mid<br/>\ndle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in<br/>\n+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=1aW-X2S2ZokW3qzZ8RgBsQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate</a><br/>\n+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=M<br/>\niddle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+<br/>\nin+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=ekWG86FHE6rjFjd8jaZHOw&gt;  school education <br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Gradua\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Gradua</a><br/>\nte+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4<br/>\n=Middle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+educatio<br/>\nn+in+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=aSJE8BjHS18knvLinwtebQ&gt;  york school<br/>\neducation <br/>\nSchool<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=G\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=G</a><br/>\nraduate+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+educati<br/>\non&w4=Middle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+edu<br/>\ncation+in+california&c=6&s=181&.sig=gkGybS6R2TNc7Ffa1FldiA&gt;  education<br/>\nin california <br/>\n <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
