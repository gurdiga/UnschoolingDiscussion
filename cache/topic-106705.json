Part of why we homeschool/unschool is so I can put my children first before other priorities.  I want their education at the top of the list!  For the past twqo months I have felt like they have taken the back burner in our family, and I don&#39;t feel this is fair.  So i agree marriage needs to be near the top; but we are adults and they are kids.  My girls are 7 n 8.  They have seen and been through alot.  They are currently very needy socially!  I&#39;m trying to find different things that will fit in our budget to help with that.  I have soem ideas, but many things are very expensive.  They miss our closest friends in IN very much.  We see them about 1ce a year, but its not the same.  They are searching for new friendships, and i&#39;m having a hard time focusing on more then one thing right now.  So for them they need to be my focus, atleast until things start to pan out for them.  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Megan and welcome! <br/>\nI see you&#39;ve already received some amazing advice and I hope some of it <br/>\nspeaks to your heart. <br/>\nI&#39;m jumping in as a mom who also had to raise kids in the midst of major <br/>\nmedical issues.  Involving the kids in your REAL life is the very best <br/>\nthing you can do for them. My kids became brain tumor experts by ages 4 <br/>\n& 2, from our trips to Mayo Clinic, weekly visits to the oncologist and <br/>\njust good honest discussions; it *is* an environment where kids can <br/>\nflourish.  When Mitch got sick, we put away our *homeschool* workbooks <br/>\nand began to focus on the /people/ in our home, on our relationships <br/>\nwith one another, not the paperwork -- unschooling -- and we&#39;ve not <br/>\nlooked back since. <br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing on your children&#39;s well-being  means the marriage issues *MUST* <br/>\nbe dealt with in an adult fashion and quickly... Don&#39;t think for a <br/>\nminute that your children are not learning from your relationship and <br/>\nthe role you each play in it.  Now is when you decide what it is you <br/>\nwant them to bring out of your family and into their own. <br/>\nLiving without a husband for 4.5 years now, has given me amazing <br/>\nperspective on how important that other adult-with-vested-interest  in <br/>\nthe home is to the family.  Mitch and I decided early in our marriage <br/>\nthat when the children came, THEY would be the focus, especially when <br/>\nthey were babies -- we would have plenty of time to be married long <br/>\nafter the kids were grown.  Even though it didn&#39;t work out that way, and <br/>\nwe knew it wouldn&#39;t, we kept our commitment to them -- we let go of a <br/>\nlot of immature pissiness in the name of raising kids and <br/>\nliving/modeling a happy marriage. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn socializing, I&#39;d recommend looking up your local hs group and <br/>\nattending parkday (we go every Tue) to check everyone out -- you should <br/>\nshow up a few times before you judge it, as not everyone shows up every <br/>\nweek. Sounds like you could use a sunny afternoon at the park, <br/>\nyourself!  I&#39;ve even resorted to hanging up fliers at health food stores <br/>\n& libraries looking for like-minded parents. <br/>\nNow that summer is here, our local park & rec department has activities <br/>\nalmost daily, from theatre in the park to game days to puppet shows at <br/>\nthe library.  A family pass to our public pools is worth every single <br/>\npenny, we swim at least 4x week and always talk to someone new while <br/>\nwe&#39;re there!  Check out the free/cheap activities first, no chance for <br/>\nresentment when they hate them ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH ~ diana :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":63441890,"authorName":"kstjonn","from":"&quot;kstjonn&quot; &lt;kara@...&gt;","profile":"kstjonn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Dover Publications","postDate":"1119199554","msgId":106761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5NDdnMityZzM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGMuNDc0YWFjNGUuMmZlNmY0NjZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":106758,"nextInTopic":106789,"prevInTime":106760,"nextInTime":106762,"topicId":106705,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you like Dover, check out this link: http://www.doverpublications.com/present12/ You can sign up and are then emailed a link each week to print-outs.

There are so many things going on in each of our lives.  And for me all of them are important.  I&#39;m not sure how to make time for all of it.  My kids education and well being come first.  I never want to change the fact we homeschool/unschool.  However I have some major medical things I need to be focusing on as well as a deteriating marriage.  That isn&#39;t to mention all the activities and other things.  How do you all make time for all of it????<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know anyone who needs childcare, send them my web addy:  www.geocities.com/mkmegan2<br/>\n <br/>\nThe larger the challenge the bigger the opportunity<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
