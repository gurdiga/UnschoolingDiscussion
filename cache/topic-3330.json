My friend and <br/>\nI started a new gift custom with our kids last year because we both got tired <br/>\nof this same dilemna. This is what we do.  We ask each child/family to bring <br/>\nan item or two for the local food bank and then after the party, we bag up <br/>\nthe stuff and the kids bring it in.  Then, so the kids don&#39;t get left out all <br/>\ntogether, we ask each family to bring one grab bag type present (wrapped) <br/>\nunder $5 in value.  Then we play a game where the kids have to answer <br/>\nquestions (usually silly ones) and the first one to get a question right goes <br/>\nto the pile of gag gifts and picks one out.  The fun part comes in when the <br/>\nothers get to pick, because they can either take from the people who have <br/>\nalready chosen or from the pile.  Then, when everybody has a gift, they all <br/>\nopen them one at a time and show them off.  Lots of times they are comical or <br/>\nreally simple.<br/>\n This probably doesn&#39;t work with really young kids who get attached to <br/>\nthings, and may not want to give up their box.  You could probably adapt it <br/>\nfor this age. We&#39;ve tried it with age 6 and up with great success.  It&#39;s <br/>\nreally been surprising...we find that the kids are often more interested in <br/>\nthe game and oohing and ahhing over what other people have unwrapped that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t seem as greedy.  <br/>\nWe thought about going cold turkey to no gifts, but ended up thinking that <br/>\nthis would be a better way to &quot;ease&quot; them off.  Then, when the kids get to be <br/>\n12+, we just take them places with their friends and still do the canned <br/>\ngoods, but we forgo the gifts and the kids seem fine with this.  We do <br/>\nusually still do some kind of goody grab bag for everybody, but we try to <br/>\nmake it practical.<br/>\nThis is one idea.  BTW, it really helps if you can get a few of the other <br/>\nparents to go in with you on this idea!   You might be surprised how many <br/>\npeople are lurking out there who also want to get &quot;off the bandwagon.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol from WI</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"The O&#39;Donnells","from":"The O&#39;Donnells &lt;praxis@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"YEExz285ZDnYkSmKD12H6EQThzec1qEVEGqc-IOuxVHCiQpgcrDg26HcGiHWglxnUk_gk1lrF8GIg5XLlK9BOqjZnIwf7tZxiQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: birthday parties","postDate":"938664921","msgId":3437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzIuMzQzNy45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3423,"nextInTopic":3483,"prevInTime":3436,"nextInTime":3438,"topicId":3330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We have a <br/>\nlarge circle of hsing friends, so we would have a party and the whole family <br/>\nwould have to be invited (because they were too young to be at a drop off <br/>\nparty).  So if I have 3 kids and our close circle of say six families has 3 <br/>\nchildren (just a for instance) that comes to 18 parties a year not including <br/>\nour own childrens.  We had to put a stop to going to most of the parties.  My <br/>\nfriends know how I feel about it.  My sons were too young so we never had <br/>\nfriend parties for them. Always at home with just us and grandparents.  When <br/>\nthey reach a certain age then they are allowed to pick a place to go like <br/>\namusement park. We have a local one which is very inexpensive, free <br/>\nadmission, and all day ticket passes are $10 each.  My dd does likes to have <br/>\nparties with her friends, being more social than the boys. Next year I think <br/>\nwe may have a sleep over with one special friend.  I really hate to deny my <br/>\nkids the fun of having a big party, and if I only had one child I probably <br/>\nwould go ahead and have parties most years.  Even when we did them for my dd, <br/>\nwe still didn&#39;t go crazy and spend lots of money on activities, just allowed <br/>\nthem to play.  Oh and one more side note, when we have just the family <br/>\nparties, the kids each get a party bag filled with little cheapo toys like <br/>\nchalk, bubbles etc.  We decorate with balloons, bake and decorate the cake, <br/>\nwrap presents.  Last year my dd specifically wanted a Bitty Baby and we <br/>\npicked her out and her accessories.  This is all she got (oh yeah plus some <br/>\nglitter glue I had promised her) for her bday.  While it wasnt&#39; an <br/>\ninexpensive gift, it was simple.  It also happens to be her most played with <br/>\ntoy which she takes everywhere including to bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Gm6rZkuP1S8f1yglTkxyai_h9pBNWInSaeSLZ3tAemfySn0YBahG-3HxVXraRH3DZpmPfQg5tw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: birthday parties","postDate":"938580474","msgId":3413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMzEuMzQxMy45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3375,"nextInTopic":3423,"prevInTime":3412,"nextInTime":3414,"topicId":3330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"what a wonderful idea (about the donations for charity at the party) then for the child, the party and the memory of it IS the gift. erin (who allows her","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2025187523\">what a wonderful idea (about the donations for charity at the party) then for <br/>\nthe child, the party and the memory of it IS the gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nerin (who allows her children a &quot;friend&quot; party every five years!)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LifesLearn@xxx.xxx","from":"LifesLearn@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fXdYlEYpyVEBgfwGTMxuz52ZgsjlXeXnG50DPVWijR4ohbbixX2yX9rHW6KJ1EPcaXgR_rQZPLE5","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: birthday parties","postDate":"938540055","msgId":3375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yMjkuMzM3NS45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3367,"nextInTopic":3413,"prevInTime":3374,"nextInTime":3376,"topicId":3330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 09/28/1999 5:27:37 PM !!!First Boot!!!, megates@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1741142090\">In a message dated 09/28/1999 5:27:37 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:megates@...\">megates@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; When I discussed it with dh, he didn&#39;t see why it was even an issue for<br/>\n me, and he&#39;s the one always complaining that we have too many toys!<br/>\n I especially like the idea to discuss this with dd -- what&#39;s most<br/>\n important to each of us about this issue and then choose a plan together. &gt;&gt;<br/>\nMary Ellen-<br/>\nWhat do you do for Christmas?

I have always <br/>\nthought they were silly (maybe I am showing my old age, but everyone didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave these big birthday parties when I was a kid.  Normally, my friends and <br/>\nmyself, had one big party growing up and another around the age of 16.  Those <br/>\ntwo parties meant alot to us, because we didn&#39;t have one every year), so we <br/>\njust didn&#39;t have them.  My kids all knew that they would get one big party <br/>\nduring their childhood.  They don&#39;t even ask for them (they have all had that <br/>\none &quot;big&quot; party and it is something they all four talk about.  We video taped <br/>\neach of their big birthday parties, so they can get them out and watch them <br/>\nover and over---they love it!!<br/>\nWe also didn&#39;t do parties (like Chucky Cheese, McDonalds, or any other fancy <br/>\nexpensive place).  Instead I decorated the house, went to the library and got <br/>\nbooks on birthday party games and made up our own, and left about an hour of <br/>\nfree time after games, opening presents and cakes.  The kids (most of who <br/>\nalways have the big theme birthday parties) all said that it was the best <br/>\nbirthday party they had ever been to!!!  I think that sometimes we give our <br/>\nkids too much, and instead of them really liking it, they are overwhelmed!  <br/>\nThese kids all thought that this simple, inexpensive birthday party was the <br/>\nbest fun that they could remember, and that spoke volumes to me!!<br/>\n     Anyway, we would still get invites to all the friends birthday parties <br/>\nyear after year.  Finally though, after years of not returning the favor and <br/>\ninviting them to ours (because we didn&#39;t have them:)--oh well) they finally <br/>\nquit asking my kids, so things have finally slowed down.  Of course, it is <br/>\neasier since we homeschool, and don&#39;t have all those birthday parties from <br/>\nthe many friends in the classroom.:)<br/>\n     My kids all enjoy the small birthday parties at home.  It is usually <br/>\njust us, grandparents, and my brother and his wife and kids.  Sometimes, they <br/>\nget to pick one kid to come also.  We let them know, that by saving the <br/>\nexpense of a big party, we can use all of their birthday money on a nicer <br/>\ngift than we could have gotten otherwise.  My kids are very happy with this, <br/>\nsince as they got older, the gifts they want have gotten more expensive.:)  <br/>\nAnyway, it works well with my kids.

Not both - to expensive.  They usually choose the one really nice <br/>\ngift &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do a TON of birthday parties - we have packed days and weekends as <br/>\nit is, so we pick and choose the ones that look &quot;low profile&quot;.  The ones at <br/>\nskating rinks, or bowling alleys are good.  We ALWAYS give books as gifts <br/>\ntoo.  And ALWAYS with a &quot;gift receipt&quot; so if the recipient has the book, they <br/>\ncan get a different one.  I have been known to do theme parties on occasion <br/>\n(when a child gets that &quot;But SuzyJo had a party and it was SO FUN&quot;) idea and <br/>\nchooses the party instead.  For these we request that the child bring <br/>\nsomething homemade, a book, a whatever matches the &quot;theme&quot;.  Most parents are <br/>\nthrilled to not have to THINK ABOUT what on earth to get yet another child <br/>\nthey don&#39;t know well for a gift.

We got<br/>\nANOTHER invitation today.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my take: we (American&#39;s) seem to have agreed that we will host a<br/>\nparty for our child&#39;s birthday and everyone will bring a (hopefully nice)<br/>\ngift.  Then when it is another child&#39;s birthday, we give them a gift. <br/>\nThis struck me as so ridiculous at the last party I attended, when the<br/>\nFOUR year old got a giant stack of gifts that he got tired of before they<br/>\nwere even all opened.  Although my children HAVE received some lovely<br/>\ngifts, they&#39;ve also got junk that I couldn&#39;t wait until they tired of or<br/>\nbroke it.  (And I&#39;m probably guilty of giving junk just bc I didn&#39;t know<br/>\na child well enough to pick out something meaningful.)  I&#39;m so tired of<br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa, nearly 7, really is quite social and has tons of friends between<br/>\nour neighborhood, homeschool group, and friends from my volunteer work. <br/>\nShe would love to have a party, of course.  I Do NOT want her to get a<br/>\ngiant pile of presents.  Her birthday is in December and it is just too<br/>\nmuch stuff all at once!  I can&#39;t imagine her choosing just one friend to<br/>\nhave a special outing with either, she really doesn&#39;t have ONE best<br/>\nfriend at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I get off this merry go round?
