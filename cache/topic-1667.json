It was so beautiful, <br/>\nand being on the grounds of the estate made it even more so.  The boys sat, <br/>\nSAT for 3 hours watching all the dramatics.

Really neat, we had even thought about becoming members of <br/>\nthe Miami Renaissance Society, but it would just involve to much night time <br/>\nactivity in Miami, and we don&#39;t go there!!!  LOL I think the site I sent <br/>\nshows some of the grounds, not sure, but you would love it, it is right on <br/>\nthe water, with docks and patio running down to and into the water.
