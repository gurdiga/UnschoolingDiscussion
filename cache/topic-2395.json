How much more I enjoyed school once I<br/>\ncould sleep late! I truly believe we all have different internal clocks and<br/>\nto go against them would always be a struggle not worth making. Of course<br/>\nmy husband would probably agree that we late-night people have a<br/>\n&quot;disability&quot; because he jumps out of bed each morning at 6:30 ready for the<br/>\nday, and is frustrated that I can&#39;t change my clock to fit the norm imposed<br/>\nby society.
