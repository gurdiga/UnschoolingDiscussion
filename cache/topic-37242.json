He is also an extremely kinesthetic person in every way you <br/>\ncan think of.  But, he&#39;s the perfect unschooler, inquisitive... you <br/>\ncan just see him learning away from everything he&#39;s doing.  Yet he <br/>\nstill has those moments of whining &quot;what can I do&quot;.  He too will not <br/>\ntake any of my suggestions (but my favorite suggestions unfortunatley <br/>\noften involve some sort of chore that needs to be done).  Usually <br/>\nwhen he hears that the floor needs to be washed he finds something to <br/>\ndo :)  He&#39;s 8 by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have 2 other children, an 11 y/o boy with ADD who is perfectly <br/>\nhappy and self-contained, he rarely says he&#39;s bored, he can spend <br/>\nhours playing Playstation, educational games, building legos or <br/>\n carving intricate swords and knives out of sticks, wood, anything he <br/>\ncan get his hands on.  My best bet is he&#39;s going to be an artist or <br/>\ndesigner some day.  We also have a soon to be 7 y/o daughter who is <br/>\nnearly obsessed with stuffed animals... she dresses them up, role <br/>\nplays a lot.  She&#39;s the one that gets teased by the neighbor girls <br/>\nfor not having a &quot;real teacher&quot;.  I know it&#39;s happening again when <br/>\nshe asks for worksheets.  She really hates those things but peer <br/>\npressure is strong for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just dropping in to say Hi...I really love unschooling and <br/>\nfeel very fortunate in not having kids that need a schedule!  I&#39;m <br/>\nabout as disorganized as you can get, always getting excited about <br/>\nsomething, like making solar ovens or cement bird baths.  Did any of <br/>\nyou see &quot;Frontier House&quot; on PBS?  I had a week long frenzy of bread <br/>\nand baking powder biscuit making from watching that!  Olivia was so <br/>\nproud of the ones she made all by herself... the boys were heavy <br/>\ninto &quot;hunting&quot; around the house (which is pretty hard to do living in <br/>\na subdivision in Florida!).  I&#39;m looking forward to reading more of <br/>\nall of your comments and suggestions... as I said, it&#39;s all very <br/>\nreassuring!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle H</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37246,"nextTopicId":37215}}
