What exactly are you teaching them?? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m being a smartalec because I&#39;ve been down that path.  Life with my husband <br/>\nwas certainly better balanced than it was after he died.  Not because my kids <br/>\nwere any different, because *I* was different without my main support person. <br/>\n Yes, I did swat my boy, for lack of other resources and because of the <br/>\npressure of my *smack-o-matic* family members.  They were not around, however, for <br/>\nthe incredible backlash that occurred when the smack was over and the trust <br/>\nwas gone.  If Hayden was incorrigible and needed a swat in the first place, his <br/>\nbehavior *after* the swat needed killin!!!  It was a cycle I could not and <br/>\nwill not continue.  I&#39;ve busted my hump to earn back the trust of my baby, and I <br/>\ndoubt it will ever be like it was before.  What *I* have to do, as the adult <br/>\nand the only remaining parent, is to decide what is *REALLY* important to <br/>\ninstill in my children.  The fact that *mom will hit you if the car don&#39;t* is not <br/>\nhigh on my list.  The fact that mom gets freaked out and doesn&#39;t know the right <br/>\nthing to do all the time is okay.

Have you read the <br/>\nexcellent book &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; by Christina Sommers?  The whole point is <br/>\nthat today the whole society, especially the schools, expects boys to act like <br/>\ngirls and labels them as hyperactive, LD, etc., when they do not.  One of my <br/>\nkids was labelled and the other was at risk of being labelled just because, at <br/>\nthe age of six, he still couldn&#39;t print neatly!  I took my kids out of school <br/>\nand they&#39;ve thrived, precisely because I accept them as they are.
