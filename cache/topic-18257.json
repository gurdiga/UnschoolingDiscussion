Just last year (I am commissioner now, not coach)  I listened as a<br/>\nmother explained why her child needed to be on team with a particular child so<br/>\nthat he could get a ride to practices since mom did not get home from big city<br/>\njob until 6:30 daily.   Furthermore, practices needed to be on certain days when<br/>\nyounger son had activities since she depended on the 11 yo to supervise  the 8<br/>\nyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese examples were for &quot;after school&quot; hours.<br/>\nFor summertime, lots of kids are in &quot;day camps&quot;  which are often special<br/>\nprograms run by daycare establishments to provide supervision and activities up<br/>\nto about age 12.     My experience is that after about age 10 families make<br/>\ndecisions based on the individual child  (able to control impulses, willing to<br/>\nbe home alone) and their own situation (older siblings at home,  neighbor<br/>\nwilling to be a contact if trouble arises,  parents or adults able to maintain<br/>\ntelephone contact, relative safety of home location)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can also remember when my now 21 yo was about 9-12 and our neighborhood teemed<br/>\nwith that age group.  I always tried to keep our property &quot;kid-friendly&quot;  as a<br/>\nway to keep my son home.    The majority of the kids did not have an adult at<br/>\nhome many days.    Watching their life skills as they participated in our<br/>\nhousehold I thought that classes covering certain basics might be very useful<br/>\nsince it was apparent  many had not given thought to what to do in potentially<br/>\nthreatening situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, many kids are home alone from very young ages.      Or they are in the care<br/>\nof others that are not quite adults yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"avalchro@aol.com","from":"avalchro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"EIPRxzDhzhfLJlr2S672n10T2z7AOMfQyQdPgBDnmfJvxW2BLUKWZtYLT4Q7_0LRqeYwa8CkVA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: missing kids, and subject shift","postDate":"986830038","msgId":18388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjEyZDljY2E2LjI4MDMyZWQ2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18386,"nextInTopic":18390,"prevInTime":18387,"nextInTime":18389,"topicId":18257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/01 7:45:40 AM Pacific Daylight Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1785428500\">In a message dated 4/9/01 7:45:40 AM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I will leave dd alone during the day occasionally for a little while -<br/>\n  but she has to stay inside and not answere the door or phone. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n I&#39;m just curious about the phone thing:  What if you have a flat tire and <br/>\n want to call and say you&#39;ll be late?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve also read that children should answer the phone in case anyone is <br/>\ncalling to see if the house is empty so I tell my son to say that I can&#39;t <br/>\ncome to the phone right now.

Most of the abductions are custody cases. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking from a state with 1.6 million people or so, we&#39;re not due our two <br/>\nper year from those stats.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have more missing teens girls, and it&#39;s hard to impossible to say which of <br/>\nthose were runaways or date-gone-very-wrong things, as opposed to <br/>\ndrive-by-and-grab.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try sometimes and fail to imagine how I would cope with the mysterious loss <br/>\nof a child.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have a friend who ran away (he&#39;s here at the moment, having spent the <br/>\nnight along with some others from the anime club which meets almost all night <br/>\nFridays at an anime shop nearby).  He&#39;s also a homeschooler.  When I knew he <br/>\nwas not where his mom thought he should be (one busy Saturday six or seven <br/>\nweeks ago), my first priority was to find out whether he was okay and what <br/>\nhis intentions were.  I threatened a kid with police coming to ask her if she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me a phone number I needed.  Within half an hour I knew several <br/>\nplaces where he wasn&#39;t, I knew he had been delivered to a shelter, and that <br/>\nhe was safe.  I told the mom he was safe at a shelter without giving her the <br/>\nother information.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was two days before his 17th birthday and she was treating him like he was <br/>\nten.  I had suggested earlier the same day (the second time she called me, <br/>\nbefore he was even due home) that she was keeping him on too short a leash, <br/>\nthat he was a good, thoughtful guy and should be cut some slack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom her point of view, she was right to be calling all over because he <br/>\n&quot;couldn&#39;t be trusted.&quot;   From my point of view, I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t leave <br/>\nsooner.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s arranging lots of things himself--has applied to a transitional <br/>\nresidence program, is going to get a GED and apply for emancipation, he <br/>\nfigured out how to finagle his social security number (his mother had <br/>\npromised for a year to get it out of the shed for him; he wanted to get a <br/>\njob).  She had given his dentist a false number.  There&#39;s an older brother, a <br/>\ngrandmother, and there has never been a resident father.   There are no <br/>\noutside relatives (those three being in the apartment).  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe would be considered a missing child, perhaps, except that friends <br/>\npersuaded him to call his mom once a week, which he does, and I&#39;m glad.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t tell her where he is, for which I don&#39;t blame him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that there are other cases of the official statistics that <br/>\ninvolve children escaping a stifling (or worse) homelife.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18352,"nextTopicId":18496}}
