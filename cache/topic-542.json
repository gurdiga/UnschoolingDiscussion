It was one of the things that led <br/>\nme  to unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nI went there from a traditional high school without a lot of choices, and I  <br/>\nloved it. I loved being in an environment where almost all of the other <br/>\nstudents  were also excited about learning. Lots of other students there at the time <br/>\nhad  been homeschooled or went to alternative schools. I loved it, and it <br/>\nchanged my  life.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeter Kawolke went to Hampshire for a year and dropped out. He told me that  <br/>\nhis experience was more frustrated-- that he thought his fellow students <br/>\nDIDN&#39;T  get learning for its own sake, etc. He thought he could do the kinds of <br/>\nstuff he  was doing at Hampshire (which he liked well enough) cheaper on his own.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son Julian is 15 and has been unschooled most of his life. He&#39;s thinking  <br/>\nabout different options for the next few years, including possibly college. <br/>\nOne  option is just to work very hard on his music and focus on that. Another is <br/>\na  music conservatory. And he told me the other day that if he DOES decide on <br/>\na  traditiona college, he wants something competitive, probably Harvard.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe reason for Harvard is that he had a very positive experience taking a  <br/>\nHarvard Extension college course, and he figures that while many less  <br/>\ncompetitive college have professors as great as the one he had, that Harvard&#39;s  money <br/>\nand prestige (and the student ratings of professors) make it likely that  he <br/>\ncould find excellent professors. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo there&#39;s quite a range: working on the Grunge band to entering  Harvard.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe already knows himself pretty well, even if he&#39;s not sure what he&#39;s going  <br/>\nto want to DO yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8151304,"authorName":"rubyprincesstsg@aol.com","from":"rubyprincesstsg@...","profile":"rubyprincesstsg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] College","postDate":"1049734625","msgId":63379,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yi4xZTAxNGUyOS4yYmMzMDdlMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63378,"nextInTopic":101403,"prevInTime":63378,"nextInTime":63380,"topicId":542,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/7/2003 12:50:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
