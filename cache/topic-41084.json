For example we know one of the largest Mithraic temples built in Italy, is under the present day Church of St. Clemente, in Rome near the Colosseum.<br/>\nChristianity being so similar to Mithraism as well as adopting so many of the same features of it&#39;s rival religions, not to mention being the sanctioned religion of the state,  I don&#39;t feel it is a leap of faith to say that it did indeed have a pretty big cause and effect on other religions.<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure there was quite so much of the, &quot;get baptized or die&quot; during this time {though undoubtedly there was some of that going on, due to documented evidence } as much as the sly switcharoo by the state, along with the destruction of the old and rebuilding of the new  and &quot;approved&quot;.<br/>\nMaybe it is better for us to agree to disagree. :-)<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n sennmanor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sennmanor@...\">sennmanor@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nRen provided a long definition of cult from a sociological point of <br/>\nview.

THAT is cultish to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been much confusion about cults and how to &#39;pickem&#39;.<br/>\nSome have difficulty identifying a cult because it is not so easy to identify <br/>\none that is not even religious. For this reason, over the years, different <br/>\ndefinitions of what actually is a cult have developed to make it easier when <br/>\nyou know little about their beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe different definitions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECULAR DEFINITION<br/>\nCULT - From the Latin &quot;cultis&quot; which denotes all that is involved in worship, <br/>\nritual, emotion, liturgy and attitude. This definition actually denotes what <br/>\nwe call denominations and sects and would make all religious movements a <br/>\ncult. <br/>\n<br/>\nCHRISTIAN DEFINITION<br/>\nCULT - Any group which deviates from Biblical, orthodox, historical <br/>\nChristianity. e.i. They deny the Deity of Christ; His physical resurrection; <br/>\nHis personal and physical return to earth and salvation by FAITH alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis definition only covers those groups which are cults within the Christian <br/>\nreligion. It does not cover cults within other world religions such as Islam <br/>\nand Hinduism. Nor does it cover Psychological, Commercial or Educational <br/>\ncults which do not recognize the Bible as a source of reality. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUNIVERSAL DEFINITION<br/>\nCULT - Any group which has a pyramid type authoritarian leadership structure <br/>\nwith all teaching and guidance coming from the person/persons at the top. The <br/>\ngroup will claim to be the only way to God; Nirvana; Paradise; Ultimate <br/>\nReality; Full Potential, Way to Happiness etc, and will use thought reform or <br/>\nmind control techniques to gain control and keep their members. This <br/>\ndefinition covers cults within all majopr world religions, along with those <br/>\ncults which have no OBVIOUS religious base such as commercial, educational <br/>\nand psychological cults. Others may define these a little differently, but <br/>\nthis is the simplest to work from. THE &#39;ORTHODOX BIBLE-BASED CULT&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nA group is called a cult because of their behaviour - not their doctrines. <br/>\nDoctrine is an issue in the area of Apologetics and Heresy. Most religious <br/>\ncults do teach what the Christian church would declare to be heresy but some <br/>\ndo not. Some cults teach the basics of the Christian faith but have <br/>\nbehavioural patterns that are abusive, controlling and cultic. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis occurs in both Non-Charismatic and Charismatic churches. These groups <br/>\nteach the central doctrines of the Christian faith and then add the extra <br/>\nauthority of leadership or someone&#39;s particular writings. They centre around <br/>\nthe interpretations of the leadership and submissive and unquestioning <br/>\nacceptance of these is essential to be a member of good standing. This <br/>\nacceptance includes what we consider non-essential doctrines e.i. not <br/>\nsalvation issues (such as the Person and Work of Christ.) The key is that <br/>\nthey will be using mind control or undue influence on their members. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn excellent book on this subject is &quot;Churches that Abuse&quot; by Dr Ronald <br/>\nEnroth. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing these guidelines of definition, Bible-based, Psychological, Educational <br/>\nand Commercial aberrations can easily be identified. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOTHER IDENTIFICATION MARKS<br/>\n(a) The group will have an ELITIST view of itself in relation to others, and <br/>\na UNIQUE CAUSE. e.i. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES RIGHT - everyone else is wrong. <br/>\nTHEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING GOD&#39;S WILL - everyone else is in apostasy. <br/>\n<br/>\n(b) They will promote their cause actively, and in doing so, abuse God-given <br/>\npersonal rights and freedoms. This abuse can be THEOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL, <br/>\nSOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW THEY DO THIS<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir leader/s may claim a special, exclusive ministry, revelation or <br/>\nposition of authority given by God. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey believe they are the only true church and take a critical stance <br/>\nregarding the Christian church while at the same time praising and exalting <br/>\ntheir own group, leader/s and work. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey use intimidation or psychological manipulation to keep members loyal to <br/>\ntheir ranks. This could be in the form of threats of dire calamity sent by <br/>\nGod if they leave; certain death at Armageddon; being shunned by their family <br/>\nand friends etc. This is a vital part of the mind control process. <br/>\n<br/>\nMembers will be expected to give substantial financial support to the group. <br/>\nThis could be compulsory tithing (which is checked); signing over all their <br/>\nproperty on entering the group; coercive methods of instilling guilt on those <br/>\nwho have not contributed; selling magazines, flowers or other goods for the <br/>\ngroup as part of their &quot;ministry&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time bible-based cults may ridicule churches that take up <br/>\nfree-will offerings by passing collection plates and/or sell literature and <br/>\ntapes. They usually brag that they don&#39;t do this. This gives outsiders the <br/>\nintimation that they are not interested in money. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be great emphasis on loyalty to the group and its teachings. The <br/>\nlives of members will be totally absorbed into the group&#39;s activities. They <br/>\nwill have little or no time to think for themselves because of physical and <br/>\nemotional exhaustion. This is also a vital part of the mind control process. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be total control over almost all aspects of the private lives of <br/>\nmembers. This control can be direct through communal living, or constant and <br/>\nrepetitious teaching on &quot;how to be a true Christian&quot; or &quot;being obedient to <br/>\nleadership&quot;. Members will look to their leaders for guidance in everything <br/>\nthey do. <br/>\n<br/>\nBible-based cults may proclaim they have no clergy/laity distinction and no <br/>\npaid ministry class - that they are all equal. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny dissent or questioning of the group&#39;s teachings is discouraged. Criticism <br/>\nin any form is seen as rebellion. There will be an emphasis on authority, <br/>\nunquestioning obedience and submission. This is vigilantly maintained. <br/>\n<br/>\nMembers are required to demonstrate their loyalty to the group in some way. <br/>\nThis could be in the form of &quot;dobbing&quot; on fellow members (including family) <br/>\nunder the guise of looking out for &quot;spiritual welfare&quot;. <br/>\nThey may be required to deliberately lie (heavenly deception/theocratic <br/>\nstrategy) or give up their lives by refusing some form of medical treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAttempts to leave or reveal embarrassing facts about the group may be met <br/>\nwith threats. Some may have taken oaths of loyalty that involve their lives <br/>\nor have signed a &quot;covenant&quot; and feel threatened by this. <br/>\nRefugees of the group are usually faced with confrontations by other members <br/>\nwith coercion to get them to return to the group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSOME ABUSES OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS:-<br/>\n1. ABUSE OF INDIVIDUALITY They adopt a &quot;groupness&quot; mentality. They are not <br/>\npermitted to think for themselves apart from the group and only accept what <br/>\nthey are told. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. ABUSE OF INTIMACY Relationships with friends, relatives, spouses, <br/>\nchildren, parents etc are broken or seriously hampered. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. ABUSE OF FINANCES Pressure to give all you can to the group. In <br/>\nnon-communal groups, members usually live at the lower socio-economic strata, <br/>\nnot because of a lower income level, but because they are always giving money <br/>\nto the group for some reason. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. &quot;US VERSUS THEM&quot; MENTALITY Isolation from the community in general. Anyone <br/>\nand everything outside the group is seen as &quot;of the devil&quot; or &quot;unenlightened&quot; <br/>\netc. Their enemies now include former friends; the Christian church; <br/>\ngovernments; education systems; the media - the world in general. Those who <br/>\nare involved with these in any way see such involvement as a &quot;means to an <br/>\nend&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. ABUSE OF TIME AND ENERGY The group controls and uses almost all the <br/>\nmembers time and energy in group activities. They are usually in a constant <br/>\nstate of mental and physical exhaustion. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. ABUSE OF FREE WILL They must unquestioning submit to the groups teachings <br/>\nand directions and their own free will is broken. Their &quot;will&quot; actually <br/>\nbecomes the groups &quot;will&quot; without their realizing it. This is done either by <br/>\ncoercive methods including low protein diets and lack of sleep, or over a <br/>\nperiod of time through intimidation. Both methods make heavy use of &quot;guilt&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRESULTS OF THIS ABUSE <br/>\nPERSONALITY CHANGES <br/>\nRelatives will say they no longer recognize the person. From a warm, loving <br/>\npersonality will come heaped abuse, rejection and feelings of hate. The cult <br/>\nmember sees himself as &quot;righteous&quot; in comparison and this comes across in <br/>\ntheir attitude toward all outsiders. <br/>\n<br/>\nLOSS OF IDENTITY <br/>\nThey cannot see themselves as individuals apart from the group. Some even <br/>\nchange their name as a rejection of their former life. <br/>\n<br/>\nPARANOID - WE ARE BEING PERSECUTED <br/>\nAny time you say anything negative about the group, whether justified or no, <br/>\nit is regarded as &quot;persecution&quot;. Any criticism of the individual is also seen <br/>\nas persecution only because they are the &quot;true Christian&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; <br/>\none - not because they, as an individual, have done the wrong thing. However, <br/>\nat the same time they will feel free to criticise whatever you believe, say <br/>\nand do because they are &quot;the only ones who are right&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nSOCIAL DISORIENTATION <br/>\nThey lose their ability to socialize outside the group. This can go so far as <br/>\nto not being able to structure their time or make simple decisions for <br/>\nthemselves when they leave. <br/>\nTheir world-view alters and they perceive the world through their leaders <br/>\neyes. They become very naive about life in general. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSEVERE GUILT COMPLEXES <br/>\nThey are made to feel guilty of everything they did before entering the group <br/>\nand are to strive to be &quot;good&quot; and &quot;worthy&quot; for &quot;eternal life&quot;. Misdemeanors <br/>\nare made into &quot;mountains&quot; so that members are in a constant state of guilt <br/>\nfor infringing even the most minor rules. Guilt comes because they aren&#39;t <br/>\ndoing enough; entertaining doubts or questions; even thinking rationally for <br/>\noneself. <br/>\nThis guilt is piled upon pile with new rules constantly being laid down about <br/>\nwhat is sinful and what is not. Illness may be seen as lack of faith - more <br/>\nguilt. Emotional illness may be seen as proof of sin in your life - more <br/>\nguilt. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUMMARY<br/>\nNot all these points will be found in every cult, but all cults will have <br/>\nsome if not most of them, although these may vary to some degree. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":110297210,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"&quot;Robin Bentley&quot; &lt;robinbentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Christianity","postDate":"1048715569","msgId":62159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWMyZjNlMiQwYmE0YmZhMCRiYTAwYThjMEBiYy5oc2lhLnRlbHVzLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzI2MjA1NzMxLjU4NjA0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEwMzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62157,"nextInTopic":62316,"prevInTime":62158,"nextInTime":62160,"topicId":41084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Are the Redwall books (by Brian Jacques) meant to be about Christianity?

She&#39;s seen The Life of Brian.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reading to her from an old storybook for children, from the 1920s or so <br/>\n(maybe earlier on the writing of this one part) and it was telling the story <br/>\nof Jesus as a child, staying behind in the temple.  The author decided to <br/>\nthrow in that Jesus had to go to school &quot;just like you do&quot; and that was <br/>\nespecially funny since Jesus did NOT go to school and neither did Holly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter seeing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat live, Holly wanted <br/>\nthe video, and wanted me to read her the real story from the Bible.  She&#39;s <br/>\nalso really familiar with Joseph, King of Dreams which is closer to the Bible <br/>\n(but songs aren&#39;t as good &lt;g&gt;) and she can compare/contrast and discuss all <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I sing a hymn to Holly, if it seems to tie in with something, and <br/>\ngive her a little tidbit of Christian belief that way.  The other day we were <br/>\nin Hobby Lobby and there was an instrumental on the muzak of &quot;Trust and <br/>\nObey,&quot; which has a really pretty tune.  I started singing the words.  She was <br/>\ninterested, but also wanted me to hush.
