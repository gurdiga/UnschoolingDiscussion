Angie <br/>\n decided that she should go back to school. The conversation went something <br/>\n like this:<br/>\n Angie:&quot;Mom, I am not learning anything!&quot;<br/>\n Me:&quot;Yes you are. You&#39;re learning all the time.&quot;<br/>\n Angie:&quot;No I&#39;m not. You don&#39;t teach us anything.&quot;<br/>\n Me:&quot;I am not the teacher. You can learn on your own.&quot;<br/>\n Angie:&quot;This is sick. You&#39;re gonna get caught.&quot;<br/>\n Me:&quot;Angie, I&#39;ve told you about unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n Angie:&quot;Yeah, mom, but we don&#39;t DO anything!!&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This conversation reminds me of the one I had with my son which led to us <br/>\nstaying home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  &quot;You have been cranky for 3 days.  What&#39;s up?  Are you feeling sick or <br/>\nis there a problem or what?&quot;  <br/>\nSon:  &quot;Well, Mom, you know, they don&#39;t really teach me anything in school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was 5 (now 6) so he hadn&#39;t had years to get used to the idea of how little <br/>\ngoes on in ps and I think that helped him cut to the chase.  We had several <br/>\nvery polite, promise-filled conversation with various school personnel after <br/>\nthat, then we left.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure school is evil but it sure isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be.  8 <br/>\nyears of it -- that sounds like a lot to get over!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think we better go outside now -- time to loaf -- it&#39;s OK, I can <br/>\nloaf, I&#39;m a grown up -- they kids will have to play!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":902,"nextTopicId":897}}
