There have been alot of great <br/>\nthings shared, which I printed out for myself to re-read and re-read <br/>\nas needed.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question for you all about what to do when you have an <br/>\nolder child that chooses to go somewhere with you that he really <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go, because he would rather not stay home alone. My <br/>\nson is 14yo and often does this. He&#39;s not always interested in doing <br/>\nwhat my 9yo and 6yo want to do, but then he doesn&#39;t have any idea <br/>\nwhat he wants to do either. I have printed up lists of ideas from <br/>\nthe discussions here, and some of our own ideas, and I suggest them <br/>\nto him, and he usually says no. My younger ones are usually saying <br/>\nyes, but can be swayed by older son&#39;s no too. The problem comes when <br/>\nolder son comes with us and then  will say, &quot;I didn&#39;t even want to <br/>\ncome.&quot; He complains and sometimes starts teasing the other kids, <br/>\njust giving them hard time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the only parent home most days, so I can&#39;t split the kids up, <br/>\nbut on the occasions I can, I have taken my older son out by <br/>\nhimself. We also go to playgrounds with skateparks often, so he can <br/>\ndo what he likes and the younger ones have stuff that they like too. <br/>\nIf my older son wants to go to a skateshop, I bring him and the <br/>\nyounger ones have to go along with us. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s old enough to be alone, but I feel guilty leaving him alone, <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re out having fun, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s having fun at <br/>\nhome. He&#39;s bored at home. He&#39;s said as much. But then, on the other <br/>\nhand, he doesn&#39;t really want to do whatever the younger ones want <br/>\neither, kwim?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I explained the situation well enough, but there it <br/>\nis. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne in FL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111380,"nextTopicId":111503}}
