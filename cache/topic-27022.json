And I think the media, and peer <br/>\npressure are convincing many people that NOT giving money to the rc or <br/>\nwhoever is pretty much unAmerican.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you want to do something...but what?  We are so stuck on this immediate <br/>\ngratification thing.  What I feel I need to do is not going to happen <br/>\novernight.  I need to practice wha tthis tragedy has taught me all the days <br/>\nof my life.
