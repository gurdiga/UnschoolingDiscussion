You child didn&#39;t refuse<br/>\nto stay silent on the subject and didn&#39;t need to keep repeating that you<br/>\nwere wrong and that she was right.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who come to the list are asking for advice. They are saying, by<br/>\nsigning on and posting, help me get to unschooling. Oom may have said help<br/>\nme, but she was *publicly stating* -- not just privately thinking -- that<br/>\nshe had no intention of changing her mind and that she was still right<br/>\nregardless of what anyone said to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Oom had not said another word about spanking, the subject would have<br/>\ndropped or gone on without her to a more general discussion of spanking. All<br/>\nshe needed to do was stop saying spanking is a good idea. She could believe<br/>\nit for the rest of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was as jarring and as useless and as full of noise (though more damaging)<br/>\nas someone continually stating on a vegetarian list that meat was good for<br/>\nher and she needed meat for iron purposes (despite the number of suggestions<br/>\non how to get iron otherwise).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Simply because Oom wasn&#39;t choosing at this point and time to see a<br/>\n&gt; certain point of view is no justification to be unkind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one needs to accept anything that&#39;s said here. People are welcome to<br/>\noffer counter evidence if they feel that what someone is saying isn&#39;t taking<br/>\ninto account some factor that many people need to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat isn&#39;t helpful to anyone is taking a public stand to insist that a point<br/>\nis right without supporting it. One of the most valuable things about this<br/>\nlist is holding ideas up to examination and sticking to discussing what is<br/>\nknowable rather than what can be believed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur society is chock full of beliefs that seem right but are there because<br/>\nof fear. People send their children to school because of fear. They hit and<br/>\npunish their children because of fear. (As well as other reasons for both of<br/>\nthose.) Oom feared for her child&#39;s life so she swatted him. Others on this<br/>\nlist might have done the same given the same circumstances and same lack of<br/>\nknowledge of alternatives. The difference is Oom didn&#39;t want to examine the<br/>\nbelief that led her to feel that swatting for safety reasosn was a good<br/>\nphilosophy. She wanted to cling to her belief that she was right. She wanted<br/>\nto have the right publicly say *here* that it was good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a right to cling to her belief. She does&#39;t have a right to bring it<br/>\nhere and present it as good advice. People have signed onto the list<br/>\ntrusting they&#39;ll get help getting to unschooling. They don&#39;t need strong<br/>\nwords confidently supporting fearful practices. They need more examination.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can help people hold their beliefs up to examination. People who publicly<br/>\nstate that they are not going to examine and will hold onto their beliefs no<br/>\nmatter what are hindering the usefulness of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m simply asking, that<br/>\n&gt; instead of focusing on what we feel Oom may be doing wrong, that no<br/>\n&gt; matter what she as a parent chooses, that she continue to be gently<br/>\n&gt; guided with non-violent paths to not spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You said you read the thread. Oom didn&#39;t want to be guided. She wanted her<br/>\npoint of view validated by the group. She wanted a *public* statement that<br/>\nit was okay for her to hold her beliefs. Why was she asking for that<br/>\nvalidation? Why did she need other people to publicly say it was okay to<br/>\nbelieve what she wanted to believe? (If she didn&#39;t need that validation, she<br/>\nwould have just dropped the subject.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list isn&#39;t for public validation of unexamined beliefs. We&#39;re not here<br/>\nto support what people want to believe is true. We&#39;re here to help them to<br/>\nget to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t want the advice we have to offer, they&#39;re plenty welcome<br/>\nto not take it. They are not welcome to publicly state over and over that<br/>\nthoughts they refuse to examine are a good and useful thing for parents to<br/>\ndo. There are other lists where those unexamined thoughts will be welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It still stands that you can&#39;t attempt to help someone<br/>\n&gt; stop hitting their child when you are bashing them and being critical<br/>\n&gt; verbally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>People can attempt it. It&#39;s possible that it won&#39;t succeed.

Just as much as <br/>\nthere is no need to spank, swat, or hit any living creature, there <br/>\ntoo is no need to do the same thing verbally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has happened in Oom&#39;s case is that she&#39;s been lashed out at, is <br/>\napparently now uncomfortable, has received very little understanding <br/>\nor kindness, and the end result? She&#39;s leaving. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes me very sad and it is so not necessary. I hope she <br/>\nreconsiders as I feel her presence here, like everyone&#39;s is very <br/>\nimportant. By verbal attacks and lack of understanding, we may have <br/>\nlost the chance to enact positive change and show people who use <br/>\nphysical force that hey, let us find a better way... I understand <br/>\nthat certain experts say this and that, etc... but perhaps simply try <br/>\nthis or that, it works for myself and others, and spanking, swatting, <br/>\nor any hitting won&#39;t be necessary. The added benefit is that you and <br/>\nyour child will build a better and stronger relationship based on <br/>\ncommunication and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-Discussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Solich&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mjsolich@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, I&#39;m not defensive though I do feel it important to defend <br/>\n </span></blockquote>people that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; appear under attack.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; People aren&#39;t being attacked, the belief that it is not necessary <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to spank<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is being defended.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I feel we can be extremely honest with one<br/>\nanother<br/>\nwithout hurling insults or treating people terribly. It is suggested the<br/>\nbest way to teach<br/>\na human being is by modeling that behavior in which we seek that being to<br/>\nfollow. Children learn<br/>\nfrom what they witness as do adults. Is it acceptable to only model my<br/>\nbehavior for my children? Would I want my children in later years to read<br/>\nemails I&#39;ve posted to a person I don&#39;t agree with justifying my abuse and<br/>\nlack of respect with various excuses because I feel I&#39;m right? Will I<br/>\ntrigger growth for another individual by attacking them? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\nIf I don&#39;t attempt to practice the very thing that I&#39;m attempting to convey,<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost. Verbal abuse only begets more verbal abuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approach I feel works miracles is to perhaps plant a seed. Instead of<br/>\npublicly degrading Oom and others no matter what the excuse, perhaps write<br/>\nsomething very honest, yet with respect and explaining my fears about the<br/>\nconsequences for her, her child, and future generations of her family of<br/>\nspanking in any forum. I may also include articles, statistics, or other<br/>\nhelpful information that may spark her and others reading my post to think<br/>\nbefore spanking and reconsider the results of their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Oom&#39;s case, instead of attack, I might suggest that as adults we are<br/>\nresponsible for our children in public places and depending on age and<br/>\ndevelopment, certain children can&#39;t comprehend not walking into traffic.<br/>\nChildren many times aren&#39;t developmentally able to figure the logic of not<br/>\nwalking into a busy street. A good tool near streets and parking lots is to<br/>\nhold tight to their hand, explaining *prior* to our journey the dangers of<br/>\nbig cars on little (and big) people, using stories, pictures, or how much we<br/>\nlove them and want them to be safe. The message before we even walk out the<br/>\ndoor is &quot;I love you, want your safety, big cars can be dangerous, hold my<br/>\nhand so I can help you be safe, etc...&quot; So this way, before we&#39;ve even begun<br/>\nour trip, we&#39;ve talked about safety, my child knows why I&#39;m holding their<br/>\nhand or carrying them or using a stroller in difficult situations, etc... Is<br/>\nit my child&#39;s fault he/she walk out into traffic? No, it&#39;s my responsibility<br/>\nto teach them about such things before the fact and holding them or tight to<br/>\ntheir hand until I feel they are developmentally able to understand the<br/>\ndanger.  I can only share my experience strength and hope. I have no right<br/>\nto degrade/abuse another human being no matter how justified I feel on this<br/>\nlist, in my home, or among strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I could have posted this before, but first things first. Let us stop<br/>\nabuse no matter what the excuse and give each other clear honest helpful<br/>\ninformation with the respect we all deserve.  Perhaps by being &quot;giraffes&quot;,<br/>\nwe can promote positive change. For those who spank or are wondering if it&#39;s<br/>\na solution, please consider alternatives and know it&#39;s ok for all of us to<br/>\nmake mistakes. It&#39;s also ok to rethink out behavior as parents and choose to<br/>\ntry another way. What works for us in our family is to attempt to guide<br/>\nchildren before events can occur such as walking near traffic. I&#39;m glad all<br/>\nare here, even those that spank as together, with gentleness, I pray we can<br/>\nall find a better way and continue to grow and learn  with dignity and<br/>\nrespect for one another we all deserve.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeva<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 22 Jul 2003 00:21:12 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: Tim and Maureen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmthomas@...\">tmthomas@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Spanking/Gentleness<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Maybe I have missed something but I am puzzled by your talking about<br/>\n </span></blockquote>violent<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;   posts and I see you as really defensive.
