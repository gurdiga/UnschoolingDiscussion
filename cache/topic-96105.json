But now that we&#39;ve lived it, I&#39;ve realized unschooling had <br/>\nmore to do with honoring the child. Certainly interests were a part of that, but if I focus on <br/>\ninterests, I sometimes find myself evaluating their choices instead of looking at my child - <br/>\nto learn something new, important, true about him or her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned that knowing my child as he is, is more important than shaping him into <br/>\nsomeone I think he ought to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, I&#39;m still nervous about things like times tables, basic math operations, and <br/>\nhandwriting for one of my children (10 years old). He still doesn&#39;t show interest in basic <br/>\nmath (even though we&#39;ve done games and tricks to make it more tantalizing) and his <br/>\nhandwriting has deteriorated (he doesn&#39;t remember which way &#39;d&#39;s and &#39;b&#39;s go or 9s and 6s <br/>\netc.) The basics that most school teachers look for aren&#39;t there. He does read, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtoh, he&#39;s memorized four poems by Robert Browning just because he likes them, he&#39;s <br/>\nplayed hundreds of hours of Star Craft (both on his own and online), loves to be read to, <br/>\nplays lacrosse, now enjoys his first dog and is an avid bird watcher. He&#39;s also much more <br/>\nhelpful around the house since we let go of the schedule to make it happen. And I&#39;m <br/>\ncontinually surprised by what he does know just from listening to our family <br/>\nconversations, movie watching and gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s truly a great kid. I don&#39;t doubt he&#39;s learning. But the truth is, I do worry that he may <br/>\nnot learn some of these essentials. And I don&#39;t know how to represent his learning to our <br/>\nyear end evaluator given that he has nothing written to show for this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts to help me?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 8 <br/>\nDate: Wed, 07 Jul 2004 14:16:46 -0000<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Julie Bogart&quot; <br/>\nSubject: One follow up comment on my ten year old<br/>\n<br/>\nIn rereading my message, I just wanted to say that I haven&#39;t made artifical attempts to <br/>\nteach him (like setting up times and using curricula). I&#39;ve used Family Math for math <br/>\ngames and have invited whoever wants to play to come. Usually my other two who are <br/>\nhome with me are rarin&#39; to go.

He also said he would never learn to read since he would never need <br/>\nto. On his own, one year, he figure it out (he was 7). So I know he has the power to learn <br/>\nwhen he wants to in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now just concerned about showing that he is learning in a way that satisfies the state.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, he is sometimes inclined to make self-deprecating comments that indicate to me <br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t think of himself as smart of able to learn what other kids learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be too complicated for the list, but if you have any insight, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 9 <br/>\nDate: Wed, 7 Jul 2004 11:10:41 EDT<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: One follow up comment on my ten year old<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 7/7/2004 9:42:36 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie@...\">julie@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with writing, he has a bird list he wants to keep but the chore of <br/>\nwriting prevents him <br/>\nfrom keeping it up.

I like that better for <br/>\nlists, anyway. Any computer at least has notepad, or, if he knows someone who <br/>\nwould be interested in his list, he could email them the list. It&#39;s nice to <br/>\nhave an intended audience when writing. Computers are better for lists <br/>\nbecause you can reorder the list alphabetically or if you use a spreadsheet or <br/>\ntable, according to the date the birds were first seen or by quantity. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe use the bird guide with post-its to keep up with the birds we&#39;ve seen in <br/>\nthe yard. He could draw a sketch of each bird he sees and put it in a file. <br/>\nThere are lots of way to keep up with stuff like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 10 <br/>\nDate: Wed, 7 Jul 2004 08:32:24 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\nFrom: Kelli Traaseth <br/>\nSubject: Re: One follow up comment on my ten year old<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Bogart wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m now just concerned about showing that he is learning in a way that satisfies the state.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat state are you in and what kind of requirements do you have? That info might help me and others in making suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Usually my other two who are <br/>\nhome with me are rarin&#39; to go. My ten year old usually listens while on the computer. <br/>\nOccasionally he will join us, but he then gets frustrated or bored and leaves.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 11 ds is the same way. Even if you aren&#39;t making artificial ways to teach, it seems like the Family Math thing strikes out with some kids. I brought that home from the library once and it did not go over well. I think to them it was still premeditated. Ya know, not just living our lives, we weren&#39;t just playing a game cuz it looks fun. We were playing Family &quot;Math&quot;. I don&#39;t know, maybe I wasn&#39;t a good enough salelperson on that, but I do know that the kids are learning tons of math, numbers, and logical reasoning from doing what they/we like. Our conversations alone have gone over algebraic equations, adding exponential notations and fractions! And those are just off the top of my head. From what I&#39;ve read it sounds like your family is a lot the same. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***And with writing, he has a bird list he wants to keep but the chore of writing prevents him <br/>\nfrom keeping it up. Yet he has no interest in working on forming the letters or working on <br/>\nit as a skill.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about working on the computer? Does he like to type? He could find the birds he likes online and print them out? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about you writing it for him so he can at least have a start on the list. Does he like to take pictures? Would he want to make a picture book of the birds he sees? That way the interest would be documented.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier you said he has memorized some poems, is he interested in writing them down? I know my son is the same way with writing. If I had to prove he was actually writing,,,,, <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you get enough other stuff documented, all the things that he is doing, the writing part won&#39;t be an issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***And, he is sometimes inclined to make self-deprecating comments that indicate to me <br/>\nthat he doesn&#39;t think of himself as smart of able to learn what other kids learn.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were getting and are still getting our school thinking out our brains, my kids will sometimes make similar comments. We&#39;ve discussed that people all learn in different ways and we all have different kinds of smarts. This seems to really help. My own father is the same type of learner as my son and has the same kind-of intelligence. Highly mechanical and logical and it doesn&#39;t look like they learn anything, by book standard. But they know sooooo much. Its all up there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe sometimes have to have these kind-of pep talks after they&#39;ve spent time with kids who are in school. One good thing though is that the talks are coming less and less. They are starting to come and tell me how they are dealing with the questions and doubts of others. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=== message truncated ===<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
