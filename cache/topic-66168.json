When we started, <br/>\nI made up an extra room for &quot;the classroom&quot; with a very nifty <br/>\ntimeline on the wall, and a world map on the wall, and a desk for <br/>\neach kid...and we &quot;did school&quot; in there about twice!

Making a kid who is <br/>\ninterested in chemistry, to read through Julius Caesar, when he <br/>\nhighly dislikes literature, just so he can display an official <br/>\ndiploma...nah.

I <br/>\nI have currently been within an environment in our church which has , in my opinion become very Child Unfriendly.  I am not surprised actually by the responses that I got about bringing children.  I know some of the other homeschooling conferences allow older children, or nursing babies. We are in the very busy stage of development (the always moving stage!) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first began my homeschool journey I was given lots of magazines ( the teaching Home) with the lovely family on the front and all the girls are dressed alike, or they are sitting very nicely dressed at the kitchen table while Mom puts away the dishes, smiling. Made me crazy!  My family was certainly NOT this way - nor did I want it to be. It has been very refreshing to see a group which is down to earth, and real. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I did a lot of reading about Waldorf, Charlotte Mason and eventually found &quot;How children Learn&quot; by John Holt at a library sale.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have since grown a lot in my feeling about children and acceptable behavior. I have been since battling &quot;rules&quot; within our church ( which I grew up and have loved) and have often found there to be a separation of parents/children. Often children aren&#39;t welcome because they make too much noise, are rowdy(especially after LOTS of sugary snacks which are provided) and are just excited to be together. I find that wonderful about them.( Their excitement and zest  - not their reaction to sugary snacks ;-) Others are not so amused and find them interfering.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been reading here for over a year. This year I have been unschooling - but sometimes I still stand on the fence - and get very nervous when I look at Math books I purchased that have gone unused. I can see my children learning, have had wonderful days with them - but still I doubt myself because I worry that my kids will grow up to be undisciplined adults that lack self-control, etc. From reading much of what you all speak about with your children, it appears just the opposite. I am really hoping to see this in person. Part of me wonders if it is just that you are just particularly good parents -)  I sometimes wish I was parented the way I see some of you coming across as parents to your children. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is scary for me! I think it puts MORE pressure on me than having a curriculum.( I never did have a packaged one - but did do unit studies and math)  One afternoon, my kids found frog eggs out in the stream - and I bet you can imagine what that turned into - a whole afternoon of looking up whether they were frog eggs or toad eggs - what they eat, etc. it was wonderful. Sometimes after about 5 minutes they decide they don&#39;t want to do whatever it is we started. It certainly keeps me on my toes!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - sorry I have gone on so long. If all goes well, we may all take the ride - We are in CT. I have a couple of Free plane tickets I could use - and was thinking that would work for my husband and I , but don&#39;t know if I could scrape up the rest for 3 more plane tickets. However - it would be an adventure. We do travel to Maryland as I assist a Professor at University of Maryland  a couple times a year - but that is only 7 hrs. and we drive through the night. I hate long car rides - but I may have to suffer through it ;-) One of those car video things is sounding pretty good ;-) <br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you all there!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\nOriginal Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 27, 2003 7:13 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling Conference in SC- Question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/27/2003 6:51:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marji@...\">marji@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">      &gt;  I just want to point out <br/>\n  &gt; that there is ample loving space at this conference for the most <br/>\n  &gt; nonconformist, individualistic, can&#39;t-tell-&#39;em-what-to-do kinds of kids.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Marji (who wishes the world in general were more like the SOS Live and <br/>\n  &gt; Learn Unschoolers&#39; Conference) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  And YOU can start writing the ads, Marji!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
