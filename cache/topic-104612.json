I like the response to Dr.<br/>\nPhil&#39;s suggestion to finish everything!  I had to laugh, because this<br/>\nis part of my issue with this process - it does feel like we&#39;re<br/>\nquitting and I feel guilty about it, even though honoring where the<br/>\nkids are at feels important as well.  Boy, I can be complicated!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds enjoys reading music that is designed so that your five fingers<br/>\ndon&#39;t move off their notes - but you play them when the music says so.<br/>\n Lots of simple tunes are written in books like this - so I think I<br/>\nmay search that out and put it back on the piano so he can fiddle<br/>\naround with it more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104609,"nextTopicId":104593}}
