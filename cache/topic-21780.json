It was the example I gave as we were talking about watching what you say to others, whether you are a child or an adult, because what you may think is a passing comment, the person it&#39;s directed at just may take it to heart. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole scene is so clear in my mind. I relive it every time I tell it. I was in fourth grade and we had just moved to Lafayette, La. My parents are active church-goers and &quot;encouraged&quot; me to join the children&#39;s choir, so I did. The director for that grade was having all of the kids sing one song out of the hymnal acapella to determine where you fell on the scale, alto, soprano, etc. We were able to pick the song, so I picked one of my favorites--Love Lifted Me, which is not an easy song for a fourth grader, I found out. Regardless, after I had sung the first verse, the director told me in front of the rest of the choir that I would be better off mouthing the words. Needless to say, I was crushed. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you know what? That&#39;s exactly what I did--all through grade school and high school! I was in the church choir for all those years and NEVER sang a note! By the time I hit high school, I had a bestfriend that was also an alto (how can you say I was when I never sang?). She had a strong enough voice for both of us and she knew my secret and kept it for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until two years ago when my youngest was born that I began to sing to her--lullabies at first, then children&#39;s songs, then in the car....now I even sing at church in the congregation. There are times when I wonder if I sound okay to the person standing next to me and I begin to worry. Lucky for me, it&#39;s usually my husband and he always tells me I sound great. Who knows if I really do? I don&#39;t care, because I love music and love to sing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a valuable lesson on the power of words....<br/>\n<br/>\nTerri <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Johanna <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, May 24, 2001 12:16 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] basic skills<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 5/23/01 5:54:21 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LisaBugg@...\">LisaBugg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; He just shook his head.
