It was published by Dutton in 1974, it&#39;s an amazing book.  There<br/>\nwas some recent discussion here about one of Sandra&#39;s talks where she<br/>\nencourages people to think dangerous thoughts.  This book is full of<br/>\nthem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom page 1:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This is a book about young people and their place, or lack of place, in<br/>\nmodern society.  It is about the institution of modern childhood, the<br/>\nattitudes, customs, and laws that define and locate children in modern<br/>\nlife and determine to a large degree what their lives are like and how<br/>\nwe, their elders, treat them.  And it is about the many ways in which<br/>\nmodern childhood seems to me to be bad for most of those who live within<br/>\nit and how it should and might be changed. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time it never occurred to me to question this institution. <br/>\nOnly in recent years did I begin to wonder whether there might be other<br/>\nor better ways for young people to live.  By now I have come to feel that<br/>\nthe fact of being a &quot;child,&quot; of being wholly subservient and dependent,<br/>\nof being seen by older people as a mixture of expensive nuisance, slave,<br/>\nand superpet, does most young people more harm than good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI propose instead that the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities<br/>\nof adults citizens be made *available* to any young person, of whatever<br/>\nage, who wants to make use of them.  These would include, among others:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The right to equal treatment a the hands of the law- ie., the right,<br/>\nin any situation, to be treated no worse than an adult would be.<br/>\n2. The right to vote, and take full part in political affairs.<br/>\n3. The right to be legally responsible for one&#39;s life and acts.<br/>\n4. The right to work, for money.<br/>\n5. The right to privacy.<br/>\n6. The right to financial independence and responsibility-ie., the right<br/>\nto own, buy, and sell property, to borrow money, establish credit, sign<br/>\ncontracts, etc. <br/>\n7. The right to direct and manage one&#39;s own education.<br/>\n8. The right to travel, to live away from home, to choose or make one&#39;s<br/>\nown home.<br/>\n9. The right to receive from the state whatever minimum income it may<br/>\nguarantee to adults citizens.<br/>\n10. The right to make and enter into, on basis of mutual consent,<br/>\nquasi-familial relationships outside one&#39;s immediate family-ie., the<br/>\nright to seek and choose guardians other than one&#39;s own parents and to be<br/>\nlegally dependent on them.<br/>\n11. The right to do, in general, what any adult may legally do. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***What do all of you think about working to<br/>\nlegislate freedom for young people, at least incrementally?  A waste of<br/>\ntime?  Can&#39;t be accomplished through legislation? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a waste of time.  Things have to change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the recent Supreme court decision which found the juvenile death<br/>\npenalty unconstitutional, Justice O&#39;Connor, one of two dissenting<br/>\nopinions, said this:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said: <br/>\n&quot;...The court&#39;s analysis is premised on differences in the aggregate<br/>\nbetween juveniles and adults, which frequently do not hold true when<br/>\ncomparing individuals,&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nShe said:<br/>\n&quot;Chronological age is not an<br/>\nunfailing measure of psychological development, and common experience<br/>\nsuggests that many 17-year-olds are more mature than the average young<br/>\n&#39;adult.&#39;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA supreme court Justice saying age is not the best factor for determining<br/>\na persons ability to understand and accept responsibility would seem a<br/>\nstep toward recognizing the rights of all Americans.  Unfortunately the<br/>\nquestioning of arbitrary age limits occurs primarily when adults are<br/>\nmaking decisions about how to punish kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are afraid of children&#39;s rights issues in the way people are<br/>\nalways afraid to give power to the powerless.  What dreadful fate awaits<br/>\nthe oppressors when the oppressed are finally given their constitutional<br/>\nfreedoms?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128695025,"authorName":"wifetovegman2002","from":"&quot;wifetovegman2002&quot; &lt;wifetovegman2002@...&gt;","profile":"wifetovegman2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Legislate freedom for the young?

I think in most cases he would say &quot;adopt.&quot;  But<br/>\nif he wants to question something, he might say &quot;bought&quot; to inspire further<br/>\ndiscussion.  Maybe if we chose to adopt from country X because it was easier<br/>\nand cheaper, he might look at it as a market decision and use the word<br/>\n&quot;bought&quot; in certain situations and with certain people to be provocative.<br/>\n(Only with those people who would enjoy a good discussion about questioning<br/>\nthe motives behind and the issues surrounding our decision.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he says &quot;bought&quot; more often in relation to our dog because we&#39;re<br/>\naware of how animals are treated as commodities, and we talk about it<br/>\nfrequently.  A recent conversation evolved from congratulating ourselves on<br/>\nthe fact our dog has a much better life than the dog next door to discussing<br/>\nhow much of a prisoner Fern (our dog) is.  So I think he still says &quot;bought&quot;<br/>\nas a reminder to me that we don&#39;t live in my personal dreamworld, as far as<br/>\nthe treatment of animals is concerned.  They&#39;re still very much a commodity<br/>\nto be bought, sold, and profited from.

This is one of those sentences I will keep in the back of my head<br/>\nand return to from time to time.  Can we?  Can&#39;t we?  Maybe we can!  I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking of Orwell&#39;s _1984_ here, not the most positive example.  But those<br/>\nin charge of language did control perceived reality, changing history daily.<br/>\nDoes language typically labeled as &quot;PC&quot; help to usher in a new reality,<br/>\nreflect real changes in society, or does it just annoy people?  And going<br/>\nback to my own example of &quot;let&quot; and &quot;allow,&quot; if I use language reflecting<br/>\nfreedom when speaking with grandparents and others about my child, might it<br/>\ninfluence their interaction with young people in some subtle way?  I really<br/>\nhave no idea.  Just pondering at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There&#39;s something about the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn.&quot;  Lots<br/>\nof people come new to homeschooling or unschooling and claim not to<br/>\nunderstand the difference, or say that teaching IS necessary, you might just<br/>\nnot call it teaching and it&#39;s just semantics, and they&#39;re not going to waste<br/>\ntheir time with trivial word choices.  But in that FLOOD of defensive<br/>\nlanguage, what they&#39;re saying is that they don&#39;t want to think about it very<br/>\ndeeply.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just came to this realization on another unschooling list.  I was talking<br/>\nabout how teaching is one part of unschooling and how I invited my mom to<br/>\nteach me to crochet, but another poster helped me recognize the difference<br/>\nbetween learning (information getting through) and teaching (tossing it out<br/>\nthere and hoping it sticks).  I realized that in my case, I had been<br/>\nequating teaching with learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; So I salute you, Julie in NY who hasnt&#39; had a baby yet, for wanting to<br/>\nmove beyond &quot;letting&quot; him do this or that, but stay on your feet and know<br/>\nthat you DO have authority and (at least linguistically speaking, and you<br/>\nwill hope legally speaking) even ownership of this child to some extent.  He<br/>\nwill be YOUR son.   So each choice you make is yours and each time you give<br/>\nhim the reins to make a choice, they were your reins to give.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI will keep this in mind.

There has got to be a<br/>\nhappy medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sophia was really little, probably 2 or 3, she<br/>\nloved the TV.  So, instead of really trying to get her<br/>\nto do other things, which was my first approach<br/>\n(&quot;Wannacaolorgotothezooplaythisgamegoseegrammagoseedaddy...&quot;),<br/>\nI tried to find all the shows I thought she&#39;d like,<br/>\nand literally, for about a month, she did little<br/>\nbesides watch TV.  I took most of her meals and snacks<br/>\nto the TV room and I gave her comfy blankies and I set<br/>\ndolls and animals near her and I looked up her<br/>\nfavorite characters using the Internet and guess what?<br/>\n She got bored!  She had seen the shows, and for<br/>\nawhile, she didn&#39;t watch much TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love to knit...well, sometimes.  I sort of<br/>\nover-knitted and got a little bored, but at first I<br/>\nknit as much as I could.  I taught myself from a book<br/>\nand I was really proud of myself.  If my husband said,<br/>\n&quot;Sarah, if you knit all the time, you won&#39;t learn<br/>\nanything else and you won&#39;t see the sunshine and your<br/>\nfingers will get blistery and your eyeballs will start<br/>\nto ooze,&quot; well, I would be annoyed with him and I<br/>\nwould probably try to knit in secret or something. <br/>\nBut he didn&#39;t say that.  He really loved the things I<br/>\nmade and he was really proud and he supported me, and<br/>\nthe passion eventually became a good hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m on to precious metal clay...and my husband<br/>\nbuilt me a work table...<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, if I would have kept knitting and if Sophia was<br/>\nstill watching 12 hours of TV a day...would those<br/>\ninterests be less valid?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband started sluffing school at 13.  You know<br/>\nwhat he did?  He played video games and more video<br/>\ngames.  He quit going to school at 14.  He started<br/>\nreading lots of books and taught himself to play<br/>\nguitar, but mainly he played with the computer.  He<br/>\ntaught himself a little about programming.  He never<br/>\ndid get his fill of computers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he went back to school at age 22, he had to learn<br/>\na bit of math, but ended up with a computer<br/>\nprogramming degree.  He makes a pretty decent living. <br/>\nI&#39;m glad he spent a lot of time playing with<br/>\ncomputers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn writing all this, I really just wanted to say, your<br/>\nson will like you more and your house will be more<br/>\npeaceful if you help him play *more* computer games. <br/>\nWho knows...it might turn into a career.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1919658844\">I  was wondering what some thoughts were on some concerns I have about my 7 <br/>\nyear old son.  I have always wanted to homeschool, and was drawn to <br/>\nunschooling.  I feel it has worked well for us.  My son has always been a <br/>\nsmart, mature in some ways, curious child.  I have always seen  him learning <br/>\nthrough life.  The whole family has learned so much through his interests.  <br/>\nHe has always been a high need child, very resistant to change, and hard to <br/>\nmeasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently he has not been interested in anything, except video games.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go anywhere.  He would play games all day if I let him, and <br/>\nthat would be fine if he limited himself and didn&#39;t become rude.  So <br/>\nrecently I will have him not play during the day and be able to play in the <br/>\nevening when his dad is home from work (they play together then).  But he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to do anything, and this is new.  New, meaning since December.  <br/>\nMy husband had been overseas for 2.5 months and came home then.  That is <br/>\nwhen the xbox came into our lives.  Before then my son certainly did not <br/>\nwant to sit down and do lessons, but I saw his natural curiosity at work.  I <br/>\nfeel that he has anger at his dad being gone, and the challenges that <br/>\nsituation created.  Then his dad is home and they have this great new toy.  <br/>\nAnd that toy is a way of connecting with dad again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wonder if this will pass or if I need to do something more active.  He <br/>\ndoes not read, and that is fine usually.  I previously felt that he would <br/>\nwant to learn when the time was right.  That is a hard one for me.  As much <br/>\nas I don&#39;t want it to matter, it does.  I don&#39;t want to measure his <br/>\nintelligence or measure our homeschooling success on reading, but I keep <br/>\ncoming back to it.  He has no interest in learning either, he says it will <br/>\nbe too hard.  He rejects anything where he thinks someone is trying to teach <br/>\nhim something.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the positive side I have seen him be very confident in what he knows.  I <br/>\nhave heard him tell people &quot;I homeschool, I figure things out for myself, I <br/>\ntaught myself how to swim, etc&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else ever been through this?  I would like to hear from others <br/>\nwho have had children with this type do learning style and hear what worked <br/>\nfor them.  Also I have a 3 year old and 8 month old daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNatalie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104148,"nextTopicId":104165}}
