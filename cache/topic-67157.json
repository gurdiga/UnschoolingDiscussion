So of course <br/>\nshe <br/>\nlet her room get totally trashed. I started getting impatient waiting for her <br/>\nto take responsibility. I told her to keep the door shut, and she is so <br/>\nforgetful, she doesn&#39;t.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you used to enforce it, the longer and farther the pendulum will <br/>\nhave to swing.  She will show you the negative image of the positive image <br/>\nyou used to enforce on her first.  So maybe, kind of in penance and as a <br/>\nlearning opportunity, just see that clearly and breathe through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s room used to be a mess, but now she&#39;s 11, changed rooms, and that <br/>\nroom has not gotten messed up at all since she moved in six or seven months <br/>\nago.   Kirby&#39;s was cleaned thoroughly a month and some ago and is in better <br/>\nshape now than when it was first cleaned!   Marty&#39;s is usually the neatest.  <br/>\nAt the moment it&#39;s pretty messy (for Marty), and so I expect that one day in <br/>\na week or two he&#39;ll hole up in there and listen to music and clean, clean, <br/>\nclean.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I bitched her out and demanded she clean it. Over a book and towels <br/>\nthat really shouldn&#39;t matter. UGH! -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDestruction of property&#39;s not cool.  I wouldn&#39;t want a book ruined.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you could have gone in and picked up towels or other public stuff instead <br/>\nof (kind of) entrapping her in destruction of property.  (Or em-mildewing <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;.  Contributing to the em-mildewization of property.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Maybe I should offer to help? A lot of times in the past she would just <br/>\ncry <br/>\nand say she can&#39;t, and she needed help. She is used to me saying no. And I <br/>\nhave helped before, but then i take over and organize things to my liking, <br/>\nand she doesn&#39;t want that either. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could help in spurts and bits.  Neither the &quot;If I help it will be <br/>\ndone my way&quot; nor &quot;It&#39;s your room, I&#39;m touching nothing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI will go in and get Kirby&#39;s laundry sometimes if I&#39;m in a laundry mood and <br/>\nhis isn&#39;t down the hole (there&#39;s a laundry chute from the bathroom in the <br/>\nhall, and laundry goes &quot;down the hole,&quot; ideally).   If I&#39;m in there anyway <br/>\n(to watch 24, or to hear a new song, or some other invitational social <br/>\nreason) I&#39;ll take dirty dishes back out with me if there are any when I leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do the same for my husband and the other kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Middle ground, oh middle ground, where are you middle ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t want to be dependant on the opinions of unschoolers for every <br/>\nparenting concern, but some insight would be appreciated, until I can start <br/>\ndoing things that work like I was born with the knowledge, without  second <br/>\nguessing and re-living past mistakes. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAng, I would apologize to her.  Somewhere besides in or around her room.  <br/>\nOutside the house, for a soda or a walk or at the grocery store, strolling <br/>\ndown an aisle where you don&#39;t really need anything.   Tell her what you told <br/>\nus, about wishing her dad hadn&#39;t said &quot;spank,&quot; and other stuff.  I would ask <br/>\nher what would help.  Maybe she would like to have a five minute assist every <br/>\nday or two.  Maybe not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think middle ground and getting over asking for help (which you don&#39;t have <br/>\nto do; I still say &quot;help&quot; when I&#39;m fritzed about something with a kid, not <br/>\nalways on this list, but there are places I do)....<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting that sentence over.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think middle ground comes from philosophy and priorities.  If you can get <br/>\nclear on what your goals and intentions are, THAT is where you go to check <br/>\nwhat you should do.  If you have priorities in your head, and if peace is <br/>\nmore important than neatness, then when that second comes when you&#39;re <br/>\ndeciding whether to yell or walk away, you think &quot;peace or neatness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier to clean up a room that&#39;s been messy for a year than to clean up <br/>\na relationship that&#39;s been getting moldy for even a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67239,"nextTopicId":67204}}
