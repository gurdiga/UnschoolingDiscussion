I first got them from the library but soon got my own copy of the Zen Commandments (Why the Chicken Ccrossed the Road is on my to buy list).  When I read Sandra&#39;s email I grabbed the book from the shelf to glance through it again.  At that moment my daughter (she&#39;s 10) came down.  She&#39;s been interested in meditation lately so I read her bits from the appendix on meditation.  My 6yo son showed up as well and they both enjoyed what he wrote.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I remembered that he had a Homer Simpson quote and I found that for them as well.  They had a good laugh and remembered the episode.  Then my daughter took the book and started glancing through it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are great books for unschoolers because there are so many little bits connected together.  He takes observations of everyday life, lots of short quotes from Shakespeare to The Simpsons to Plato to David Byrne, and brings it all together in a fun and simple yet profound way.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.livingjoyfully.ca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"zen books","postDate":"1084470548","msgId":94004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYi40MTcxYTk2ZS4yZGQ1MGYxNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94008,"prevInTime":94003,"nextInTime":94005,"topicId":94004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/13/04 6:04:20 AM, mkirk@columbus.rr.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1946370375\">In a message dated 5/13/04 6:04:20 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mkirk@...\">mkirk@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\nI&#39;ve always had an interest in Buddhism, but never really spent time reading<br/>\nabout it.<br/>\nAny book recommendations on the subject....besides the one that Julie<br/>\nrecommended?<br/>\nWould love some suggestions. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nZen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind is pretty easy to find, but happier, easier and two <br/>\nof my favorite books in the WHOLE WORLD are fun and funny and profound and <br/>\naccessible things PERFECT for unschoolers called Why the Chicken Crossed the <br/>\nRoad and The Zen Commandments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re listed and linked on an obscure backwater page of my website, but <br/>\nI&#39;ll cut&#39;n&#39;paste from there and then list the link of Dean Sluyter&#39;s site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNEW AND INSPIRING: Any book by Dean Sluyter:<br/>\n Why The Chicken Crossed the Road and other Hidden Enlightenment Teachings <br/>\nfrom Buddha to Bebop to Mother Goose <br/>\nThe Zen Commandments: Ten Suggestions for a Life of Inner Freedom <br/>\nA review of the first one, which appears in the second: <br/>\n<br/>\nThis smart, sassy, and idiosyncratic spiritual resource is divided into <br/>\nsections on cosmic jokes, sacred nursery rhymes, exploding proverbs, and accidental <br/>\nhymns….Sluyter proves to be a subtle and imaginative guide through the <br/>\ncontemporary world of pop culture, dazzling us with epiphanies….He provides fresh <br/>\ntakes on faith, devotion, grace, being present, beauty, practice, selflessness, <br/>\nforgiveness, simplicity.
