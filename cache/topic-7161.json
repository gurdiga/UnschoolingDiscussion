I &#39;m not talking scientifically or anything, a gene of some other plant, \nanimal, bacteria, or chemical has been spliced into the genes of a food plant, \nsuch as corn, wheat, rice,usually a mass, produced staple item.&nbsp; The \npurpose, (is what I found to be questioneable), is to prevent certain crop \neating bugs from devouring a crop.&nbsp; (But from what I&#39;ve learned in Organic \ngardening studies is that bugs usual eat the weak plants in an environment, they \nprefer these less energy consuming foods, which is a benefit to the environment \nnot to be wasting it&#39;s energy growing weaker plants, that are not likely to \nsurvive for generations to come..like a biological safeguard.)&nbsp; SO things \nsuch as BT, a chemical sprayed on crops to kill these bugs, rather than spray it \non they splice it right into the genetics of a plant.&nbsp; They don&#39;t even \nbother to tell YOU it&#39;s safe...they just pass it on to the consumers.&nbsp; \nNever knowing , really, what will occur genetically, down the road....to the \nplants, bugs , or people.&nbsp; They figure this research, and study , and \nsplicing and diceing is for the benefit of the environment, people, whomever, \ncause it allows us to mass produce,( even though we could already do \nthat.)..bigger better, resistant foods, with MOre vitamins and MInerals, (and \nweird chalky tomatoes, Now have you ever seen a chalky</font><font size=\"2\"> \nRoma...I never did..not before&nbsp; too long ago.)&nbsp; I am of the phylosophy \nthat all that we need is all amoung us, their is an abundance of foods, ways to \ngrow medicine for every person.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s that the resources have been \nseeped out of the earth in one place or another, and now there is little or \nnothing to live on while other parts of the globe, continue to experience, and \nabundance of foodsand resources, and continue to go about the use of them \nirresponsibly.&nbsp; Now ,I believe it is two ways of looking at things....the \npredominant way..in &quot;How&nbsp;can I control this, and make it do what I \nwant?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the exchange way&nbsp; &quot;I will take only what I need, and \nI will leave&nbsp;enough to grow&quot;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What can I give you in \nexchange for your service,my time&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &quot;What can I give&nbsp;&quot;, \nwhere one party&#39;s efforts are a direct exchange of energy, and the use of that \nenergy&nbsp;, such as food in a thankful way, after all , you would be likely to \nknow where you got it from, and the time it took to become what it was, Was that \ntime crammed ina small barn, poked and prodded for 2 years, and then sent all \npackaged , nicely to you...or did it roam ina field , grazing, with it&#39;s \nyoung?&nbsp; Which would I want to eat?&nbsp; The seed born out of lab , spliced \nwitha gene, from something , totally foreign to it&#39;s natural state...or the \ngrown from the seeds that have worked just dandy with Mother Nature for all \nthese years , before this became some craze of control over the natural \nworld.&nbsp; How can we use the resources wisely, instead of always needing to \nmanipulate things?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, I&#39;m \ngoing on forever , now.....well the least they could do was inform me, of this \naltering of food genes, so I could decide for myself what I would or would not \neat, not assuming for me that I would choose what they choose.I think it the \nresponsibilty of those that offer products to the public of providing the \nknowledge of it&#39;s source, and any information, concerning it&#39;s manipulatiuon or \naltering from a natural state, all things I would Not know by looking at \nit.&nbsp; When I make something....it is the spirit inwhich it was \ncreated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7160,"nextTopicId":7162}}
