Cambridge is just far <br/>\nenough that it&#39;s not worth going home then coming back to get him, so whoever <br/>\nbrings him has to kill time in Cambridge. Another unschooling mom (Caroline, <br/>\nwho was at the SC conference) has a son in a class same time as Julian&#39;s, and <br/>\nthe first week she invited me to go to a local church that has a Soup Kitchen <br/>\nand feed homeless folks. So I&#39;ve been doing that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeth (my partner, if you don&#39;t know that) brought Juls this week, and planned <br/>\nto do the same.  Now, last Saturday, Beth, who has been wanting to learn to <br/>\ndrum, got a wonderful drum when we went to the Renaissance Faire. So she <br/>\ndropped Juls off at his class, then started to head to the church.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen a rather large group of people walked by with cool drums, playing as <br/>\nthey went along. She started talking to them, and they have a drumming group that <br/>\nusually meets on Wednesdays, but was changed to Thursday this week. They <br/>\ninvited her along. She got to try a lot of different drums, got a lesson from this <br/>\ncool old woman drummer, and got to play with the large group of <br/>\nAfrican-America Harvard men, who were thrilled with her because she was so excited. They <br/>\nwere disappointed when she said she couldn&#39;t make it the next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe ran into Caroline after, who thought it was VERY cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth came home glowing, and Julian was thrilled for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82021,"nextTopicId":82008}}
