It would forever <br/>\nmark that mom as a wackjob in my mind and file all interaction with that <br/>\nfamily under &quot;something to be forever avoided&quot; in my mind.<br/>\nYou NEED to let other people in the group know about this before they <br/>\nalso are on the receiving end of this gal&#39;s brand of conflict <br/>\nresolution. I&#39;d also suggest that kids who do not want to share need not <br/>\nbring their toys to parkdays. You&#39;d think this would be a forgone <br/>\nconclusion but somepeople.......<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck had commented on a similar problem within our group years (has it <br/>\nbeen that long?) ago.<br/>\nAt the time I thought the mom who&#39;s child (lets call him J, 10yrs) had <br/>\nbeen wacked was completely within her rights to go off on the other mom <br/>\nand child and yell how &quot;If my children are not safe....&quot; and stalk off. <br/>\nIn hindsight I can see a pattern of her kids never doing wrong and other <br/>\nkids being on the receiving end of her wrath.<br/>\nYes, the child doing the whacking (lets call him A, 4yrs) was way outa <br/>\nline and his mother had no idea how to give him freedom while still <br/>\nmaking sure he understood boundaries and personal space issues. Yes, the <br/>\nmother of the wacker did step up and effectively parent her kid. He <br/>\nbecame a delightful child to be around and even my son, who had avoided <br/>\nhim, began to play with him once the little boy understood that Josh <br/>\nment it when he yelled &quot;don&#39;t ever do that to me again&quot;.<br/>\nBUT, as a group we should have addressed the problem before the blow-up. <br/>\nNo one wanted to the mother of A&#39;s feelings OR question how she was <br/>\nraising her child.<br/>\nInstead we all whispered about it and he was quite the scape-goat for <br/>\nawhile.<br/>\n I also feel it gave J&#39;s mother just a little too much feeling of power <br/>\n(IMHO...and Tuck may not agree with me and more recent events could be <br/>\ngiving me a bias here and it was some our fault as J&#39;s mother was <br/>\nsomeone we all SO admired and well, almost worshipped) over the children <br/>\nand especially A. So much so that a latter incident involving one of J&#39;s <br/>\nbrothers and A filed J&#39;s family, in my son&#39;s mind, under &quot;kids to never <br/>\nplay rough with because if they get hurt it will always be your fault <br/>\nand never theirs and you will be publicly humiliated by their mom&quot;.<br/>\nJosh avoids public humiliation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phone is your friend. The other mom&#39;s need to be sounded out and <br/>\nmade aware of the incident. It will help to say &quot;yes my son did over <br/>\nreact with kicking, but since he now has a police record I think he&#39;s <br/>\nbeen amply punished.

I know that when Katie had a hard <br/>\ntime getting along with other kids, we curbed that involvement. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want her to repeatedly have bad experiences. She outgrew it, <br/>\nand then we were able to rejoin groups. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this would be a hard thing to do, since you have friends <br/>\nthere. And maybe Riley can hang out with someone (is your mom <br/>\nthere?) while you swing by parkday for a little bit. Or maybe you <br/>\ncould just stick to the more organized activities that the group <br/>\ndoes or through the community arts center. Riley may have more <br/>\nsuccess (and make some friends) when it&#39;s a little more structured.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the least, I think I&#39;d express my shock on the email list that <br/>\nthis woman called the police over the situation.

My son, 7 got in a fight during a parkday.  Specifics are he wanted to check out a toy, the boy who brought the sword would not share. When the sword was down on the ground my son picked it up to check it out. Owner ran after him, grab tackled him, my son reacted by fighting and kicked him hard. I was the parent who sprinted to stop this, out in the field. It lasted all of 15 seconds. The boys split, the one who owned the sword was hurt from my son. My son needed away time for cool down so I left him alone. During the next 5 minutes I chatted with the mom and the boy, making sure he was ok. He was a bit hysterical about other things talking about trying to do what his counslers say to do etc.They left without waiting for my kid to come over, so the boys did not get a chance to talk through what happened. Well, the mom called the police who showed up at my door a few days later. She did not try to contact me after the incident. She told the police I was overprotective of my son and she wanted it documented that he battered her child.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you all think I should do? My son and I have talked about the group, he actually doesn&#39;t like the kids there that much so one option is to just drop hanging out with them. The group is active, I like the families and have been attending for several years. This mom is relatively new, she often has personal toys with her that her child does not share and which causes similar conflicts. Part of me wants to open this up to the other 50 members for discussion, but I hesitate to. My husband is a bit freaked out because the officer said the family could press civil charges against us for this. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101793,"nextTopicId":101778}}
