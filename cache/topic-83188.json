For example:<br/>\n    <br/>\n  --He was probably in school everyday.  So right there is a different scenerio from any of our families.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --What was his environment like at home, was there anything stimulating and interesting to do?  Did his parents do things with him?  I knew lots of families that TV was the kids only option because the parents didn&#39;t want to do anything with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --Maybe he had comments to him all the time like, &quot;oh he&#39;s a magnet to the screen, he just sits in front of the TV allll the time&quot; that would create a negative feeling within him.  Why would he leave the TV? <br/>\n<br/>\n  --What if he was really into TV and became a writer, or producer or actor.....the list goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just some thoughts that I wanted to throw out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  A couple years ago I would have had the same &quot;screen&quot; issues as alot of others.     Now I really see all those &quot;screens&quot; as resources.   As far as computer use-- there are many in my family that were drawn to screens.  They now work with computers,  one of my brothers is a computer programmer for the State of Minnesota and one is an engineer, who invents computer programs for GE.  Not bad, huh?          So,  no worries!  :))<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli~  sitting at her screen right now  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83171,"nextTopicId":83196}}
