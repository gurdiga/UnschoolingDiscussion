Any advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just tell them &quot;This is what works for me&quot; and maybe explain a little bit<br/>\nif they haven&#39;t heard of unschooling before. I also have a good feel for who<br/>\nelse in our homeschooling group are using different<br/>\nmethods/classes/curriculum. We have a couple of families of Waldorf-inspired<br/>\nhomeschoolers, we have a couple that use packaged curriculum, we have many<br/>\nthat fall into the &quot;eclectic&quot; range, we have a good faction of unschoolers,<br/>\nand we have some that use the classes available through our school districts<br/>\nhere. So I tell people what the range is, and who they can talk to that most<br/>\nmatches up with what they envision their homeschooling to look like. I do<br/>\nthis knowing that sooner or later they will most likely drift more and more<br/>\ntowards unschooling, especially if they start hanging out with our group. I<br/>\nsee people fall of the the curriculum wagon all the time as they realize how<br/>\nmuch it frustrates themselves and their children. The day that they start<br/>\nasking &quot;What&#39;s going wrong? Is there a better way?&quot; then I will give them<br/>\nmore information on unschooling. I give as much as I think a person can<br/>\nassimilate at a time. Sometimes that&#39;s a little, sometimes that&#39;s a lot. Of<br/>\ncourse, if anyone asks me directly what I think, they&#39;ll get an earful!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62794,"nextTopicId":63160}}
