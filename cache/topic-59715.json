Yes, sometimes they do need to cry<br/>\n  in your arms. My oldest daughter sometimes needed to cry for over an hour at<br/>\n  a time when she was 2, for longer when she was an infant. There is a<br/>\n  brilliant woman, Aletha Solter, who has written a number of books on the<br/>\n  subject of why children (humans!) need to cry, with someone who loves them<br/>\n  listening. Her web site is &quot;Aware Parenting&quot;, and there&#39;s also The Parent<br/>\n  Leadership Institute, which was founded by Patty Wipfler, another brilliant<br/>\n  parent. I have met both of these women, and Aletha&#39;s children, and raised<br/>\n  all 3 of my beautiful children using this way of parenting.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had the same problem. I think maybe if it <br/>\nwere me, I&#39;d look elsewhere as to what&#39;s going on around the house. Sounds <br/>\nlike maybe he just wants some control or even attention. I&#39;m just talking <br/>\nout loud here. But I do know that sometimes behaviors that stump us come <br/>\nabout for other reasons. The kids just aren&#39;t &quot;wanting&quot; to be bad. Hopefully <br/>\nyou will figure it out and he will too and all will be okay again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your e-mail with MSN 8.

Yes, sometimes they do need to cry<br/>\nin your arms. My oldest daughter sometimes needed to cry for over an hour at<br/>\na time when she was 2, for longer when she was an infant. There is a<br/>\nbrilliant woman, Aletha Solter, who has written a number of books on the<br/>\nsubject of why children (humans!) need to cry, with someone who loves them<br/>\nlistening. Her web site is &quot;Aware Parenting&quot;, and there&#39;s also The Parent<br/>\nLeadership Institute, which was founded by Patty Wipfler, another brilliant<br/>\nparent. I have met both of these women, and Aletha&#39;s children, and raised<br/>\nall 3 of my beautiful children using this way of parenting. That&#39;s all...<br/>\nRobyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59913,"nextTopicId":59955}}
