It&#39;s important to discuss the hows and <br/>\nwhys and wherefores of unschooling, but it is likewise important to <br/>\nbe aware of the very real forces that would put unnecessary legal <br/>\nrestrictions, restraints and controls on what parents and their <br/>\nchildren do in the privacy of their own home. Unschoolers should <br/>\ninform themselves about what&#39;s happening in the state and national <br/>\npolitical arenas (especially with HSLDA pushing for federal <br/>\nlegislation), what the national media is fussing about (with all <br/>\nthese recent child abuse articles), and how those dynamics will <br/>\naffect the freedoms of homeschoolers down the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, we at HEM have tracked the political atmosphere <br/>\nof homeschooling for over 20 years, and we&#39;re seeing more reasons for <br/>\nconcern right now than at any time in the past. Because this is no <br/>\nlonger my list I&#39;ll respect Sandra&#39;s wishes not to discuss it here <br/>\n(at least not any more than with this post), but if anyone does want <br/>\nto discuss what&#39;s going on I recommend these resources:<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling News & Commentary from Home Education Magazine<br/>\nA weekly report on what&#39;s happening in the world of homeschooling<br/>\nCompiled and edited by Ann Lahrson Fisher<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/whts_nw.html</a><br/>\nThis week&#39;s edition focuses on homeschooling as &quot;scapegoat-o&#39;-the-day <br/>\nfor society&#39;s ills.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n* * *<br/>\n<br/>\nHEM-Networking Email List<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HEM-Networking list is sponsored by Home Education Magazine (HEM) <br/>\nfor networking and communication within the online homeschooling <br/>\ncommunity.
