Any one have a remedy for<br/>\nconstipation and irregularity for our 3 yr. old <br/>\ndaughter?  She eats like a bird too.  We&#39;ve tried<br/>\npears; she gets burned out on them.  Applesauce<br/>\nseems to constipate her.. odd huh?  Any ideas<br/>\nwould be appreciated. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNot strange at all that applesauce might add<br/>\ntothe problem.  When kids have diarrhea, the ABC<br/>\ndiet is often recommended--applesauce, bananas<br/>\nand cereal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend trying lots of fresh fruits and<br/>\nveggies, and increasing fluids.  Try juice<br/>\npopsicles and icees if she isn&#39;t a big liquid<br/>\nfan.  If buying then is a pain, make mini<br/>\npopsicles in ice cube trays--probably a better<br/>\nsize for her anyway, and you can offer them more<br/>\nfrequently.  Same with the fruits and<br/>\nveggies--offer small amounts often.  You&#39;d be<br/>\namazed at how much more you can get down kids<br/>\nthat way!&lt;G&gt;  Its like when they are<br/>\nbarfing--offer a teaspoon every 10-15 minutes and<br/>\nyou&#39;ll get a LOT down them and they often don&#39;t<br/>\nlose it!&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com\">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38467,"nextTopicId":38473}}
