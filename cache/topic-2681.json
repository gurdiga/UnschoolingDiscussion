Play is the basis of all education. Play is the<br/>\ncreative<br/>\nwonderland from whence the joy of learning comes. The need for joyless<br/>\nwork as an<br/>\nadult will come on its own without anyone trying to plan in advance for<br/>\nit...and<br/>\nwho knows maybe with the habits of self-direction and<br/>\nself-determination  your<br/>\nkids will avoid the joyless compromise that so many of us make.  The<br/>\nidea that<br/>\nsomething must &quot;go&quot; somewhere else  to be worth anything is imho a<br/>\nmistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in the moment, being here now, is the essence of happiness.<br/>\nSomething we<br/>\nas adults have to strive to remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hate to disagree about something that is non-testable but I think if<br/>\nyour kid<br/>\nwas left alone he would have read all on his own.  Maybe years later<br/>\nthan you<br/>\nwould have liked but he would have.  The fear is such a pernicious<br/>\nthing.  We<br/>\nhave most of us, been schooled til we can&#39;t think straight about many<br/>\nthings.<br/>\nReading is certainly one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Hsmotgo@...\">Hsmotgo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Hsmotgo@...\">Hsmotgo@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 9/4/99 0:09:07 AM EST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Anyway,  we finally decided to go for it.  We felt<br/>\n&gt;  like if we only stuck our toe in intead of jumping in completely,  we<br/>\n&gt;  wouldn&#39;t be able to convince our son that he really was in charge of<br/>\n&gt;  his education and that it was his choice from now on.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You know, I read this, and the rest of your response, and I think that is so<br/>\n&gt; great.  But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in<br/>\n&gt; the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up in<br/>\n&gt; the morning?  All summer, I let the boys pretty much do what they wanted, I<br/>\n&gt; asked them to practice their music everyday, and read 30 min. a day.  They<br/>\n&gt; did that, and then played with their Dragon Ball Z action characters the rest<br/>\n&gt; of the time.  Now, they don&#39;t even want to read, just play.  Do I guide by<br/>\n&gt; saying, you  do music, reading and something that you choose, or what?  I<br/>\n&gt; know I am dense at this, I have been reading the list, asking questions,<br/>\n&gt; getting good answers, but it isn&#39;t really going well.  Given a choice, they<br/>\n&gt; just want to play, and while I know that games teach some things, they have<br/>\n&gt; learned what the games have to offer already, and are not moving on.  My 5th<br/>\n&gt; grader is learning to enjoy reading, but only because I made him read this<br/>\n&gt; summer.  I let him buy a book of his choice, on a subject he wanted, and we<br/>\n&gt; went from there, also Harry Potter helped a lot!  But, If I hadn&#39;t made him,<br/>\n&gt; and believe me, they have always been read to, and see me read all the time,<br/>\n&gt; he still wouldn&#39;t be reading, cause that&#39;s boring.  Wait, he can read, he<br/>\n&gt; just never said I am going to my room to read a book.  So,  to make a long<br/>\n&gt; story even longer, I am reluctant to let go.  Guess I have the control streak<br/>\n&gt; in me from my mom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to be so long, but geesh, I am kinda frustrated here<br/>\n&gt; Teresa<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ONElist members: don&#39;t miss out on the latest news at ONElist<br/>\n&gt; Join our community member news update at<br/>\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter5</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
