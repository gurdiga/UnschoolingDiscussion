I was wondering how far you think your<br/>\ninfluence as a parent &quot;now&quot; will stretch in to the future, if at all?  Is<br/>\nthere an underlying question you&#39;re asking, that you haven&#39;t fully<br/>\nrecognized?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis discussion brought to mind, for me, my tendency over the years to blame<br/>\nmy parents for my problems... and how difficult it has been to take<br/>\nresponsibility for my problems. Sure I&#39;ve given my parents credit, as well,<br/>\nbut for this topic, I&#39;m focusing on blame.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an adult, I have tools, experiences and have sought examples to help me<br/>\nchange, but I struggle with how difficult change is because of the way I was<br/>\nraised created habits that feel impossible to break, sometimes...basically,<br/>\nmy emotions make the struggle more intense.  I mean, if I&#39;m working on<br/>\nmyself, (taking responsibility), yet get frustrated that I can&#39;t change,<br/>\nquicker, I might start to feel angry with my family for having created an<br/>\nenvironment that *made* me this way. Yet, stopping my growth-work to feel<br/>\nangry & blame others is just as unproductive as was the environment my<br/>\nparents created years ago... and now *I&#39;m* the &lt;responsible&gt; adult!  Seeing<br/>\nit that way helps slap me out of it, dissipate my anger, stop the blaming<br/>\nand move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else that comes to mind as I write this is that I don&#39;t really<br/>\nreach out for help from my parents. I&#39;m sad that we are so disconnected, but<br/>\nhave brushed it off as a consequence of *their parenting*.  I hope that I<br/>\ncan model a strong sense of self-awareness, compassion, strength, and wisdom<br/>\nso that my daugther will choose to stay connected to me, no matter what age<br/>\nshe is, and vice versa.  In that way, my sphere of influence directly<br/>\nreflects a connection to my daughter, now & always. Perhaps I need to spend<br/>\nmore effort reconnecting to my parents, if not only as a model for my<br/>\ndaughter, but for my own personal growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I make any points in musings?  I think I interpreted your words in this<br/>\nthread a desire for people to take responsibility for their lives. Yet I am<br/>\nnot sure whether you agree with us that your actions as a parent have a<br/>\n*lasting* effect on your children, regardless of their ability to be<br/>\nresponsible.<br/>\n****<br/>\nEducation.is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.<br/>\n-- John Dewey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158915970,"authorName":"Alan Marshall","from":"&quot;Alan Marshall&quot; &lt;alanlmarshall@...&gt;","profile":"alanlmarshall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: effects of how children are raised","postDate":"1121435635","msgId":107298,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctREFWNjhFQzIyRDgxQjVENjczODgzMEI2QTVEMDBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":107286,"nextInTopic":107309,"prevInTime":107297,"nextInTime":107299,"topicId":107283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... up with cultural/religous/school/birthorder/environmental factors To me, the influence of genetics, sibling position, etc. make mindful parenting that much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1364542731\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How we raise them does matter.

And I agree, I think it makes a huge difference. I think societal ills could be improved and the Hinckleys and Dahmers of the world largely prevented if our culture could move toward better parenting. Not that there are not other factors and influences, but you can profoundly affect the multi-generational disease processes of your family of origin. This can be seen easily with physical symptoms - a genetic tendency for heart disease or cancer can be mitigated by changes in diet, lifestyle, stress reduction (perhaps an even bigger factor than previously thought) etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking has been influenced by Bowen Theory - family systems theory - (www.thebowencenter.org/pages/theory.html) - which views birth order, family of origin etc. to have a large influence for good or ill on our emotional life. But far from being fatalistic, Bowen therapists train people to intentionally influence and improve the health of the family system. This is done primarily through self-differentiation. Mindful parenting could be seen as a form of self-differentiation. Parenting focused not on how children behave, but on how I behave.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlan    <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschoolinginfo\">http://www.unschoolinginfo</a>&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

The more useful comparison, it seems to me, are where<br/>\nthe similarities are numerous so that the difference (here unschooling) has<br/>\nmore obvious causality.  Or, if you want to think of it another way, how<br/>\ncould John Hinckley&#39;s life been different (assuming you knew him really<br/>\nwell) if he had been raised with more kindness, more attachment more<br/>\nunderstanding than he got?  Could his pathology have been addressed?  Who<br/>\nknows.    But I think I know in the case of my own children that if they<br/>\nwere raised in an unkind, uncaring, environment instead of the one I try to<br/>\nprovide for them they would be more frustrated, less happy, they would have<br/>\nmore self doubt than they presently have.  I feel certain that they are<br/>\nbetter off and better people because of this.  If I didn&#39;t I might be<br/>\nstanding in line for the most convenient behaviorist style quick fix<br/>\nparenting I could find.  I&#39;d put them to bed on a schedule, get rid of them<br/>\nat school and daycare and get on with my own interests , hobbies, or<br/>\nprofession.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow we raise them does matter.  It matters a lot.  You only need to look at<br/>\nthe kids in your personal experience to find ones that would be so much<br/>\nhappier if they didn&#39;t have to go to school, or if they had parents who<br/>\nlistened to them instead of making decisions for and about them.  Of course<br/>\nit matters.  But as in most things it&#39;s complex.  The longer I parent the<br/>\nmore I feel that at it&#39;s core, it&#39;s the love, kindness and respect that<br/>\nmakes the difference.  AP and unschooling are an expression of those things<br/>\nbut when I think of the really great kids I&#39;ve known  who come from more<br/>\ntraditional families, those qualities are still core.  Too simplistic, I<br/>\nknow, but still important.  All kids need these things and some do a lot<br/>\nwith precious little but they would still do better with more.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK I guess everyone can tell I&#39;m on a midnight rant. %)  Tomorrow I&#39;ll read<br/>\nthis in the digest and blush.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107311,"nextTopicId":107261}}
