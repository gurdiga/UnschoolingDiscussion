We&#39;ve lost family and friends <br/>\nBut we&#39;ve made the choice not to forget their lives and tragic ends <br/>\nThough we&#39;ve had our share of troubles we have put them all aside <br/>\nAs a nation grieves we find ourselves defending them with pride <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re a nation of survivors, with one heart we share a tear <br/>\nBut we live to serve the memory, not giving in to fear. <br/>\nThough they try to take security with the things they&#39;ve done and said <br/>\nAll their acts of inhumanity bring unity instead. <br/>\nSo we stand here as a family. One heart, one soul, one voice. <br/>\nWe are challenged by this moment, and united here by choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnonymous<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nThe above poem was written by one of the teens on the teen list I<br/>\nmoderate.
