So he sets his own hours and <br/>\nchooses which clients he wants to take. I like the idea that we can <br/>\nhave conversations like we did last night:<br/>\nDH: I&#39;m so tired of the rain, I want to be someplace sunny.<br/>\nMe: Well, why don&#39;t we drive to Southern California?<br/>\nDH: How about next week?<br/>\nMe: I have the homeschool fair to do, how about the week after?<br/>\nDH: Okay<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the flexibility of controlling our own time is very important <br/>\nto us!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also became his own contractor this year and built an 8,000 sq ft. <br/>\nhangar. That was a learning experience for him as he had never done <br/>\ncontracting, dealt with getting permits from the city, pouring <br/>\ngigantic slabs of cement, getting plumbers and electricians, etc. In <br/>\na sense, it&#39;s like unschooling for grownups, it was something he was <br/>\nreally excited to do. He also did some flight instructing this year, <br/>\nand as flying is a great passion for him, that&#39;s more play than work <br/>\nas well. Now that he&#39;s done, he&#39;s looking around to see what kind of <br/>\nproject he&#39;d like to tackle next. Meanwhile, I wrote my first novel <br/>\nand am now in the process of editing it. I hope to shop it around to <br/>\nagents and publishers in a couple of months. I just finished writing <br/>\nmy first article as well, and I might try my hand at some more if I <br/>\ncan sell the first one to a magazine. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to each do things that we love to do, and try to make enough <br/>\nmoney to get by. Our goal for both of us is to have enough money <br/>\ncoming in eventually from our various enterprises that any work we do <br/>\nwill be optional. I really like the approach detailed in books <br/>\nlike &quot;Multiple Streams of Income&quot;. Neither of us ever wants to work <br/>\nin a job where one hour of our life equals some bit of money, where <br/>\nwe are basically selling our time. It&#39;s our goal to use our passions <br/>\nto create projects (like a hangar we can rent out or a book that <br/>\nproduces royalties) that will keep generating income so that we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be wage slaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, our sporadic approach to work means that one of us <br/>\nis always with the kids, and that DH gets to take a more equal hand <br/>\nin parenting than many fathers get to.

One thing I <br/>\nlike about our unschooling/unjobbing lifestyle is that we all get to spend a <br/>\nlot of time together. We don&#39;t have to make a point to take time to connect <br/>\nor socialize, because we do that at various times during the day&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes I agree. I have always cooked meals daily. Meals as I knew them with <br/>\nmeat, starch and veggies and possibly salad too. I have been doing this for <br/>\n26 years non stop. Even when I was single and unattached (briefly &lt;BEG&gt;) I <br/>\nstill cooked for myself every day. About 6 months ago, possibly more, I <br/>\nnoticed that the children weren&#39;t eating like they usually did and I was <br/>\nthrowing out a lot of leftovers. I was wasting food and hating it. We were <br/>\nall so busy and everyone was on their own hunger schedule and mealtime for <br/>\nus, well, it actually was a hassle. Didn&#39;t seem like anyone wanted to really <br/>\ncome to the table when it &quot;was time&quot;. And I AM a good cook. LOL!!! That&#39;s <br/>\nwhen I started to question whether it was necessary for me to keep the <br/>\ndinner routine (yes routine) going. That&#39;s when I realized that we were <br/>\nspending a lot of time together talking and playing and sharing, dinner <br/>\nwasn&#39;t important for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Well, for me I&#39;m an on-the-go kind of person. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d <br/>\nrather be doing than eating, frankly. I like food, it&#39;s good nourishment for <br/>\nthe body, but that&#39;s mostly what it is to me.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t eat out much, mostly because we&#39;d rather spend the money on other <br/>\nthings, so we do eat at home, and I do cook sometimes (like the yummy Phad <br/>\nThai tonight), but as often as not, our family is snacking our way through <br/>\nthe day.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what we do now. And the kids actually eat better and seem to do <br/>\nbetter because of it. My husband and I try to every night sit down together <br/>\nalone and eat. For us, it is necessary to connect. Our time together is much <br/>\nless than with the kids. And during the day, well I know how you feel about <br/>\nrather doing other things. Joe will actually call me to find out if I ate <br/>\nanything. I just tend to forget I&#39;m so busy with other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Every now and then I like to &quot;dine&quot; and really sit back and enjoy some <br/>\ngood food, but the rest of the time just fuel me up!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSame here. Every so often I have a great need to go out with Joe to a <br/>\nrestaurant and have someone else wait on me and bring me good food!! I&#39;m <br/>\nstarting to feel that again these days.

One thing I like about our unschooling/unjobbing lifestyle is that we all get to spend a lot of time together. We don&#39;t have to make a point to take time to connect or socialize, because we do that at various times during the day. Today I snuggled in bed with the kids for half an hour, then I went swimming and DH spent 3 hours with the kids, then DH went to work for awhile and I spent the late morning/afternoon with the kids, then DH came home and we all went for a walk down to the store for a popsicle and walked home in the rain. We&#39;ll spend the evening hours as a family, then DH and I will get time together after the kids go to sleep. It all works out somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;When it comes to eating and socializing, Americans should take a cue <br/>\n&gt;from the rest of the world. Really. The chef in me takes offense at how <br/>\n&gt;people treat food. There is no soul to it, no joy. At home, especially, <br/>\n&gt;most people just eat to eat, they don&#39;t dine. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, for me I&#39;m an on-the-go kind of person. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d rather be doing than eating, frankly. I like food, it&#39;s good nourishment for the body, but that&#39;s mostly what it is to me. If you gave me the choice between being able to have a really gorgeous 4-course meal and going on a 40 mile bike ride, I&#39;d choose the cycling any old day. Now someone else might choose the meal, but that doesn&#39;t make them any more joyful, soulful, or refined than me. I get my joy elsewheres.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t eat out much, mostly because we&#39;d rather spend the money on other things, so we do eat at home, and I do cook sometimes (like the yummy Phad Thai tonight), but as often as not, our family is snacking our way through the day. We eat a lot of fresh fruits and veggies, and I try to add in some kind of protein and grains along the way. Sometimes the kids are hungry when I&#39;m not. Often I&#39;m eating or DH is eating when no-one else is since both of us are training and frequently hungry. I do bake things with the kids, we made bread yesterday and muffins the day before, but frankly for me the big sit-down meal is overrated. My body also feels a lot better when I eat smaller meals more frequently. I don&#39;t like to ever feel full, I feel slowed down for hours after a big meal.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery now and then I like to &quot;dine&quot; and really sit back and enjoy some good food, but the rest of the time just fuel me up!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) My underwater swimming dolphin<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99)   The girl who makes everyone laugh<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/\">http://www.exmsft.com/~robinc/</a>  Flying Clevenger Family Webpage<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":56051484,"authorName":"grlynbl@aol.com","from":"grlynbl@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Eating just to eat vs dining","postDate":"1043537611","msgId":56372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlNS40YTk5MTEuMmI2NDc4Y2JAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":56373,"prevInTime":56371,"nextInTime":56373,"topicId":56372,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Julie and Liza.. . about preparing a meal and all sitting down to eat..  ..
