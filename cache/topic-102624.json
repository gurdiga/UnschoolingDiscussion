I didn&#39;t have that exact example above, but a few things, like  <br/>\ntotal subject changing, or dirty looks or whining.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut to do it with the thing above, I would pick some non-crucial time or  <br/>\nmoment and when he started to tell me something I would cover my ears and yell  <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not listening&quot; and turn away and maybe really lay it on.  When it  <br/>\nhappened with my kids I did it just long enough for them to think &quot;WHAT!?&quot; and  then <br/>\nfigure it out, and then start to get frustrated.  About five seconds,  <br/>\nprobably.  And then if they protested, I&#39;d say &quot;I thought you thought that  was an <br/>\nokay way to communicate&quot; or something like that.  Or &quot;I thought you  liked <br/>\nwhining.&quot;  And they&#39;d say something and I&#39;d say something real and  immediate, like <br/>\n(them) &quot;Well I don&#39;t,&quot; and (me) then maybe you should do it  to other people <br/>\nbecause they don&#39;t like it either.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo it was a little role-playing moment removed from the time when they were  <br/>\nactually in the throes of their own irritating behavior.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not the best thing I ever did with kids, but it&#39;s not the worst,  <br/>\neither, and sometimes a couple of seconds of shock that they can think about in  <br/>\ntheir own way later can be useful.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat is IF the kid has some interpersonal or intrapersonal skills.  I  think <br/>\na child with Asperger&#39;s or other shut-down in the social skills area might  <br/>\nnot benefit from it, if they can&#39;t transfer what they&#39;ve felt to what others  <br/>\nmight be feeling, or if that behavior wouldn&#39;t surprise them or hurt their  <br/>\nfeelings any at all.  Then I have no ideas but to just give it time.<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Breathe&quot; was the thing said most here, and the kids will say it to me,  too, <br/>\nif I&#39;m  hurt or getting seriously flustered and feeling like I have NO  time <br/>\nand things are spinning out of control.  &quot;Breathe.&quot;  And it goes  with eye <br/>\ncontact and a deep breath to model and share.

You can&#39;t change him directly, but your reaction makes <br/>\na huge difference. Find calm things to say to acknowledge that he <br/>\nwants attention and ask him to say it in a different way.

I see many similarities <br/>\nin your Jayn and my son Logan (who just turned 6).  He, too, will exhibit <br/>\navoidance/denial behavior when something happens. Typically, when I try to <br/>\ndiscuss an appropriate behavior he will close his eyes and tell me he is <br/>\nsleeping.  He does not hit other children, only me and his father. And he <br/>\ncan turn his anger on and off so fast it amazes me. He could be lashing out <br/>\nat me - growling, punching - and then the next second turn to his baby <br/>\nsister and smile and kiss her. So I see that his behavior is a ploy for <br/>\nattention. He was the center of attention for nearly 6 years before his <br/>\nsister came along, so that has a lot to do with it, although he had been <br/>\nhitting us even before she was born. I see clearly that when he is bored or <br/>\nfrustrated that we can&#39;t give him complete attention, the yelling and <br/>\nhitting begins. But nothing we do seems to curb this behavior. I&#39;ve tried <br/>\n&quot;holding&quot; - he will have none of that, practically wrestles me to get away <br/>\nand he is quite strong. I&#39;ve tried &quot;punishment&quot; in the sense of putting him <br/>\nin his room and holding the door closed (we have no locks and he will not <br/>\nsimply stay in if I tell him to) - this just adds fuel to the fire and he <br/>\nends up screaming and throwing things. I&#39;ve tried punishment in the sense <br/>\nof taking things away (no treats for two days, Gameboy taken away, etc.) <br/>\nand this does not seem to affect him. He&#39;ll tell me (smugly) &quot;I didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto play Gameboy today anyway.&quot;  I am at a loss for how to stop the hitting, <br/>\nand I feel I don&#39;t have any way of preventing it - there WILL BE times when <br/>\nhe is bored and I can&#39;t entertain him. So I am trying now to simply ignore <br/>\nit and just tell him &quot;You can not hit&quot; and moving away from him. Yes, he <br/>\nwill follow me, but if it&#39;s my attention he&#39;s after, hopefully he will see <br/>\nthat hitting is not the way to get it. I suppose it will just take time, <br/>\nlike anything else!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>\n-- Yoda<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon Entin, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:entinfamily@...\">entinfamily@...</a><br/>\nLow Carb Living, Scrapbooking & Homeschooling at www.ShannonEntin.com<br/>\nFamily updates at www.TheEntins.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102652,"nextTopicId":102676}}
