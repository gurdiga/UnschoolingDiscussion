Start by going to the store and buying an egg.  <br/>\nTake it home and put it in the incubater and in 4 days (game days) you will have <br/>\na chicken.  Also each season you can forage for things in the forest, like <br/>\nmushrooms, berries, and medicinal herbs.  Put these in your produce bin and you <br/>\nwill get money everyday.  On this version you can also go to the guy who runs <br/>\nthe stable and get part time work.

She&#39;s in the midst of a Super game at the moment.  <br/>\nShe tried to play the 64 game but it was before she could read, so she&#39;s <br/>\nplanning to try that again now that she has the 64 in her room.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut about the Playstation version she says this:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are berries you can pick by the pond where the goddess comes up.  And <br/>\nthere are little yellow flowers that you can sell to the flower shop and you <br/>\ncan sell the berries to the grocery store.  Blueberries or the yellow/orange <br/>\nberries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have an owned game and there was a booklet with it where you can look up <br/>\nwho likes what, who hangs out where, when the festivals are, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking for cheats or walkthroughs, look for &quot;save the homeland&quot; so <br/>\nit will be particularly that game. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dig in your farm, in the garden area, just dig sometimes with your hoe <br/>\nand there will be rocks you can sell at Louie&#39;s Tool Shop.  Sometimes there <br/>\nwill be gold in the ground there too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do a job for money (and eventually earn a horse if you do it long <br/>\nenough) at Brownie&#39;s Farm.  Go up to Bob (a scary looking guy) first thing in the <br/>\nmorning, and say that you want to do volunteer work.   Brush the horses and <br/>\nmilk the cow.  You get to save the milk, which you can sell, and depending how <br/>\nlong you stay at the farm, he will give you some money.  Just run around and <br/>\nstay there a while and he&#39;ll give you more money.  When you want to go, just go <br/>\nup the hill.   (I&#39;m typing what Holly says.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost any of the plants you can see you can pick up and sell somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s something you can&#39;t sell and that&#39;s grass, but you can feed it to <br/>\nyour dog.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust put food in the dish by your front door, and grass will work, and after <br/>\na while if you chase a dog around it will let you pick it up.  At first when <br/>\nyou chase them they&#39;ll run away, but if you keep putting food out every day and <br/>\ndon&#39;t chase the dog every day, then one will let you pick it up after while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the thing to look for is &quot;walkthrough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1160699,"authorName":"Penn Acres","from":"&quot;Penn Acres&quot; &lt;pennacres@...&gt;","profile":"mtnsky2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Harvest Moon","postDate":"1075525069","msgId":89994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzcwMWMzZTdiNiRjNmY2NGJjMCQxNWUwYjVkMEBHcmFjZVBlbm4+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMmUwMWMzZTdhZCQ0MWQ1ZTA4MCQxNWUwYjVkMEBHcmFjZVBlbm4+IDwwMmMyMDFjM2U3YjIkYzI2MDFlYTAkZmQwMGE4YzBASmVubnk+"},"prevInTopic":89992,"nextInTopic":89995,"prevInTime":89993,"nextInTime":89995,"topicId":89991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Kelly-I did go to Game Faqs first -however am back there and finding more.... grace [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-123703732\">Thanks Kelly-I did go to Game Faqs first -however am back there and finding more....<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Harvest Moon","postDate":"1075523344","msgId":89992,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyYzIwMWMzZTdiMiRjMjYwMWVhMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMmUwMWMzZTdhZCQ0MWQ1ZTA4MCQxNWUwYjVkMEBHcmFjZVBlbm4+"},"prevInTopic":89991,"nextInTopic":89994,"prevInTime":89991,"nextInTime":89993,"topicId":89991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Try gamefaqs.com.
