Have you ever had someone irate at you because you homeschool your kids?  The true-believers treat school almost as a religion and see people who question their faith as a threat to it&#39;s foundation.  It&#39;s even worse as an Unschooler, I try to avoid letting people know that we don&#39;t follow a pre-packagfed curriculum, if they think I&#39;m playing school&#39;s games in my own home many can relax... except they then bring up the &quot;S&quot; word, then I tell them exactly what I think about school socialisation and ask them just how much they enjoy the company of teens... most say that they don&#39;t and I reply that&#39;s largely to do with too much age-segregated socialising and wouldn&#39;t it be better to learn social skills from adults instead.  Most shut-up at this point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your other questions I think the 95-98% and the &quot;It didn&#39;t hurt me&quot; attitude sums up most complacency.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to why you [we] are different maybe we fall within the 2-5% of people who can resist brain-washing, maybe we were abused as children and this causes us to not entrust the most precious people in our lives to the unloving care of strangers [this seems to be a sad fact behind a lot of homeschooling mothers], maybe we were a part of the school system and saw as teachers how much time was merely crowd control and how little time was of any real value to the inmates, maybe we were rebellious and never got the school religion and kept the rebellious spirit long enough to allow our own kids to benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue Gallien<br/>\nThe Winona Farm, Minnesota<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thewinonafarm.com\">http://thewinonafarm.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164396504,"authorName":"Elizabeth Roberts","from":"Elizabeth Roberts &lt;mamabethuscg@...&gt;","profile":"mamabethuscg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] my questions","postDate":"1075512496","msgId":89985,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTMxMDEyODE2Ljg4NjA0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJ2ZXRvYStjaG9sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89980,"nextInTopic":90006,"prevInTime":89984,"nextInTime":89986,"topicId":89980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I think that to a degree it IS because it s been so many generations now going through the system.
