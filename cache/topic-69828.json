I certianly enjoyed hearing that through <br/>\nall this craziness..LOL!  We had such a non-traditional day and I was <br/>\nso happy being Mom to my boys today.  My 4 yo ds just played the <br/>\nHarry Potter game for the first time without dad and from the <br/>\nbeginning!  He caught the snitch, even his dad (our video game stud <br/>\naround here) could not do it!  He is showing more confidence lately <br/>\nand we are so proud of him.  He would always say &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how&quot; and we were so frustrated in how to motivate him to <br/>\ntry.  I do not know if it is the unschooling, but I am truely <br/>\nappreciating many more parts of my life!  Good grief I let the baby <br/>\nnap til 8 and they just went to bed at 11!!  But that was what worked <br/>\ntoday, and they are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Solich&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mjsolich@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This morning my boys told me I was more like an angel than a mum. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Jacob went on to explain that if he took all the love out of an <br/>\n </span></blockquote>angel and then took me apart and then put it all together, he would <br/>\nhave me!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; They are the best! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They are outside at the moment playing with their enormous dinosaur <br/>\n </span></blockquote>collection.
