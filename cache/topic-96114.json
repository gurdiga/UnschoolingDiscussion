I spoke to &quot;John&quot; and he said that ever since Rand McNally Company bought Thomas Guide, they no longer give tours.   In fact the printing and assembling of the books now take place at another factory close by.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love field trips and I remember as a teenager pouring over Thomas Guides with my Grandmother.   She would tell of places and people she had visited and I would look up the address and she would tell me stories about the area.   It was fun.  She love maps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I sure wish I could have seen the plant.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane, even if I never did make it to the destination.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxanne Trimper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Trimpertribe@...\">Trimpertribe@...</a><br/>\nTorrance, California USA<br/>\nMom to <br/>\nJacob, 17 (Graduated in June after 13 years of Homeschooling)<br/>\nChristiana Joy, 14, (SSHD, ileosotomy, chronic pain, 9th abdominal surgery 05-17-04)<br/>\nJeremiah, 11<br/>\nJosiah, 9<br/>\nJuliana, 8<br/>\nLauriana, 4<br/>\nAlicana, 3<br/>\nWife to Jon<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;A child is a natural product.
