I was an excellent reader in that I could rattle off<br/>\na page of words but it wasn&#39;t until I was in college that I had really<br/>\ngood comprehension or developed any writing skills to speak of.  But I<br/>\ntested well because of the question / answer format--- mostly multiple<br/>\nchoice.  It was like a game of intuition where my pencil hovered on<br/>\nwhat I felt was the correct answer.  Might as well as sometimes the<br/>\nquestions weren&#39;t particularly well written or were perhaps<br/>\nintentionally ambiguous.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister in law just tested her 9 year old homeschooler and I was<br/>\nstruck by how badly worded the tests were.  Some of them made<br/>\nabsolutely no sense.  ANYhoodle.
