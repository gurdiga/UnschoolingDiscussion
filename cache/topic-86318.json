I KNOW this because I am <br/>\nlucky enough to spend a lot of time with both groups of young adults. I <br/>\nteach college freshman at a community college - talked to and observed <br/>\nhundreds of 18 to 25 year olds over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids aren&#39;t perfect. They suffer from plenty of angst and <br/>\nthey get into drugs or bad relationships or eating disorders or <br/>\nwhatever. Probably in far smaller proportions than schooled kids, is my <br/>\nguess, but still --- sometimes I feel the need to say this because <br/>\notherwise I sound like I think unschooling is a panacea to all of <br/>\nlife&#39;s problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould also be that people with a combination of playful and responsible <br/>\ngenetics are drawn to unschooling and it isn&#39;t unschooling that leads <br/>\nto this apparent dichotomy. Maybe our kids would have been like this <br/>\neven if they&#39;d been schooled. No telling. But I doubt it. At least <br/>\nunschooling lets it all happen in a wonderful blossom of full <br/>\nexperience of life and not crammed into the constraints of schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122649447,"authorName":"sonyacurti","from":"&quot;sonyacurti&quot; &lt;jcurtielectric@...&gt;","profile":"sonyacurti","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"unschooling math/reading","postDate":"1071494414","msgId":86318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJya2NlZSs4ZjA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":86330,"prevInTime":86317,"nextInTime":86319,"topicId":86318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, Thanks so much Pam for your insight and wisdom on math.

My son is only 7 and so much <br/>\nyounger (playful) compared to most public school kids but yet so <br/>\nmuch more mature in other ways (responsible) does this make sense to <br/>\nanyone. He has older brothers that go to public school at their <br/>\nmothers house and they sort of look like hey how come Joey doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to do all that stuff that we did in school. Joey doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nany different so he doesn&#39;t care and he always says I love being <br/>\nhome schooled I play all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember who shared John Holt&#39;s philosophy on letters and <br/>\nnumbers but it was also comforting. When I ask Joey what time it is <br/>\non a digital clock he often says mom I&#39;m confused I can&#39;t tell the <br/>\ndifference between the 5 & 2.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way I was the one who started this whole idea on &gt; less than <br/>\n&lt; greater than. I mentioned it as a reference to how Joey was <br/>\nlearing about his #&#39;s in a game of cards playing war. That is one of <br/>\nthe concepts in that game wich # is more or less. I just happened to <br/>\nmake a quick reference to how it was similar to what they do in <br/>\npublic schools(and how I always got confused on the symbol) with <br/>\nthose worksheets only we were doing it in an unschooling way. Who <br/>\nknew the coversation would take the twist that it did. The <br/>\nconversation grew and grew.
