I&#39;ve only<br/>\nread the first three or four chapters, but those focus directly on<br/>\nstudies of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation. I think this speaks<br/>\nfairly directly to what you want to know, as unschoolers avoid pushing<br/>\nexternally motivated learning on their kids. I recommend you see if<br/>\nyour library has this book, and dip into it a little.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExcellent book!!  This is the book that really helped me with the <br/>\nrewards/punishment issue and arbitrary limits!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109477,"nextTopicId":109470}}
