Like reading. Like learning to speak the langage(s) of your family or the place where you live. When I wanted to learn Portuguese to be able to communicate with my Brazilian then boyfriend who didn’t speak French no English nor German no&nbsp;anything but Portuguese when I met him, and I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;living in Brazil or Portugal, I (thought I) decided to learn it so that I could communicate with him. I (thought I) made a conscious decision to do it. I wouldn’t have needed to decide anything if I was living in&nbsp;Portugal or Brazil, but I wasn’t. I wasn&#39;t even with him, as we met, spent a week together and then work kept us apart for 2 months. I spent hours (6 or 7) every night working on it, self-motivated by THE great motivator, love. But it was&nbsp;certainly a decision for me - or I thought it was until this minute. :)&nbsp;</font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">My mom has been talking about wanting to learn Portuguese for years, to be able to&nbsp;communicate with her daughter’s husband’s mother (is there a word for that? :)), who doesn’t speak anything but Portuguese and who’s a great little woman we all adore. She has a book by her bed - same book I used (</font><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;\">hours every day)&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">to learn Portuguese.

But&nbsp;my mother never so far made the decision to do it, so she’s not even&nbsp;looking at the book that she keeps by her bed, and&nbsp;she’s definitely not speaking&nbsp;Portuguese. :)</font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">My dad, married to a German woman (my mom) and a big fan of Wagner Operas, would say things that suggested he loved the German langage and&nbsp;would be thrilled if he&nbsp;could read Goethe or Rilke in the&nbsp;original langage, but he never really&nbsp;“ decided&quot; to do it b/c it probably wasn’t that important for him.

I did! &nbsp;Three years later I&#39;m still learning about and unlearning misconceptions I had about unschooling when I started, and I&#39;m more careful now than I used to be about assuming I understand something well enough to tell others about it. &nbsp;And anytime I make that assumption, and then talk, I usually learn something new about what I don&#39;t actually know yet. ;)<br><br>I have also known people who don&#39;t talk a lot directly about it, but live it really well, and when you&#39;re around them and their kids, it&#39;s pretty clear they&#39;re doing something wonderful. &nbsp;Those people have been the most positively influential on me, among the people I have met in person.<br><br>I used to talk more about unschooling, which was pretty silly--presumptuous too-- because I still am not technically unschooling. &nbsp;My oldest would now be in kindergarten and I live in a place where kindergarten is mostly non-compulsory. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t talk about it very much very often. &nbsp;But I did feel that impulse for awhile, being excited about something amazing and wanting to tell everyone all about it-- &nbsp;I wanted to spread the good news! &nbsp;Like some sort of evangelist. ;) &nbsp;<br>I tend towards shyness and not wanting to create conflict, or causing people discomfort, so fortunately for everyone--me included--I didn&#39;t make a good evangelist.<br><br>Anyway, the deeper I got into my own deschooling, the more I saw how little I really understood well, and how problematic it could be for me and for others for me to talk much about it, especially without an actual invitation to talk about it. Even with an invitation to talk about it, right now I say very little, I explain I&#39;m learning about unschooling, and direct them toward better resources than myself. &nbsp;I do more discussing in online forums where more experienced unschoolers can point out where I might not be clear on something.<br><br>That might change over the years, and it might not, I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;But even with parents with older kids I&#39;ve met, the ones who talk less about what they&#39;re doing, and *live* what they&#39;re doing instead, have been a better example for me to learn from.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#39;t never mention it out loud, but I definitely have been working on being more careful and thoughtful about when and where and how to talk about it with others, and that practice has helped me learn better about what my motivations are, and to better sort out and honor my priorities, as well as the dignity of others to make choices that are different from mine.<br><br>Lisa

My son (9) has always been around water - this summer we&#39;ve been in the local pool at least 2 or 3 times a week,&nbsp;and is confident, but he finds swimming - especially freestyle\n - hard work. Because he&#39;s muscly...he sinks very easily. He finds it hard to float on his back. It&#39;s a physical thing that is well known - kids and adults with lots of dense muscle don&#39;t float so well, so find it harder to swim. He finds breast stroke easier\n as his legs and middle don&#39;t sink so quickly...his Dad and Granddad have the same problems with swimming.<br>\n<br>\nI guess if he swam every day, and really wanted to become better, he would build up other muscles to make that possible.

Like reading. Like learning to speak the langage(s) of your family or the place where you live. When I wanted to learn Portuguese to be able to communicate with my Brazilian then boyfriend who didn’t speak French no English nor German no&nbsp;anything but Portuguese when I met him, and I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;living in Brazil or Portugal, I (thought I) decided to learn it so that I could communicate with him. I (thought I) made a conscious decision to do it. I wouldn’t have needed to decide anything if I was living in&nbsp;Portugal or Brazil, but I wasn’t. I wasn&#39;t even with him, as we met, spent a week together and then work kept us apart for 2 months. I spent hours (6 or 7) every night working on it, self-motivated by THE great motivator, love. But it was&nbsp;certainly a decision for me - or I thought it was until this minute. :)&nbsp;</font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">My mom has been talking about wanting to learn Portuguese for years, to be able to&nbsp;communicate with her daughter’s husband’s mother (is there a word for that? :)), who doesn’t speak anything but Portuguese and who’s a great little woman we all adore. She has a book by her bed - same book I used (</font><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;\">hours every day)&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">to learn Portuguese.

But&nbsp;my mother never so far made the decision to do it, so she’s not even&nbsp;looking at the book that she keeps by her bed, and&nbsp;she’s definitely not speaking&nbsp;Portuguese. :)</font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><font color=\"#3f3f3f\" face=\"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto\" size=\"2\">My dad, married to a German woman (my mom) and a big fan of Wagner Operas, would say things that suggested he loved the German langage and&nbsp;would be thrilled if he&nbsp;could read Goethe or Rilke in the&nbsp;original langage, but he never really&nbsp;“ decided&quot; to do it b/c it probably wasn’t that important for him.

I hope I’m wrong about that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I’m right about is that there are many peaceful benefits of the kind of unschooling we’ve discussed here for a long time (and in other places before this).

They may not even be aware that they feel something in response to our stuff - it may be entirely subconscious for them. They may only realise many, many years later that they felt a certain way and that that influenced them from then on.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I thought I wasn&#39;t creative and didn&#39;t like art for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn&#39;t until I had an experience with an art teacher and my own children that I realised that an art teacher of mine sparked those feelings by &#39;improving&#39; on my artwork for me. She thought she was being kind. In fact, without me really understanding the feelings or being aware of them at the time, she was telling me my art wasn&#39;t good enough.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So don&#39;t assume you know how your words affect your children and definitely watch out for using that assumption to assuage any feelings of guilt you may subconsciously harbour. I&#39;m not having a go at you, just trying to make you be more aware of your words.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I wonder if your mum had any idea you felt betrayed by her helping you learn to swim the way she did...? Just something to think about.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned&quot;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sounds like it would be better to have conversations about safety around water when you&#39;re going to be near the sea or whatever. Adults who are excellent and experienced swimmers drown when they don&#39;t make sensible decisions. Your son will be safer if he&#39;s unschooled because unschooling, by it&#39;s nature, fosters critical, clear thinking in all members of the family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; So she said she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling&quot;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m in the UK. I used to do autonomous learning thinking it was the same thing by another name. I was wrong - it isn&#39;t the same.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; also that you can offer suggestions - while at the same time having no agenda - which again is a fine line, because if you’re looking at getting change at the shop like an opportunity to be doing math when the child hasn’t asked anything, that’s can be a bit pushy and it is having an agenda. But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be.&quot;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When you understand unschooling, you&#39;ll realise that these are not a fine lines at all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you really understood unschooling, you&#39;d see that this sentence isn&#39;t true at all. If I answer my child&#39;s questions about money, I&#39;m not doing maths with them without saying the word &#39;maths&#39;, I&#39;m simply answering her questions. If a colleague asked me to explain to her how to do a drug calculation, I wouldn&#39;t think I was doing maths with her, I would think I was showing her how to do a drugs calculation. It&#39;s no different with my children.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">(Sometimes unschoolers will talk in those terms to explain to those new to the concept how children learn these things without schooling. But they&#39;re not actually thinking about their children&#39;s lives and learning in those terms)</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And uschooling is the very opposite of neglectful parenting and those who think it is anything like it or close to it are totally misunderstanding it. Some people misunderstand unschooling and do it wrong and end up neglecting their children, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re not taking the time to learn about unschooling properly.

But I remember feeling so betrayed&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever our children say, we don&#39;t really know how they feel about something we&#39;ve said, done or even feel or fear. They may not even be aware that they feel something in response to our stuff - it may be entirely subconscious for them. They may only realise many, many years later that they felt a certain way and that that influenced them from then on. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I thought I wasn&#39;t creative and didn&#39;t like art for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn&#39;t until I had an experience with an art teacher and my own children that I realised that an art teacher of mine sparked those feelings by &#39;improving&#39; on my artwork for me. She thought she was being kind. In fact, without me really understanding the feelings or being aware of them at the time, she was telling me my art wasn&#39;t good enough. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So don&#39;t assume you know how your words affect your children and definitely watch out for using that assumption to assuage any feelings of guilt you may subconsciously harbour. I&#39;m not having a go at you, just trying to make you be more aware of your words. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I wonder if your mum had any idea you felt betrayed by her helping you learn to swim the way she did...? Just something to think about. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sounds like it would be better to have conversations about safety around water when you&#39;re going to be near the sea or whatever. Adults who are excellent and experienced swimmers drown when they don&#39;t make sensible decisions. Your son will be safer if he&#39;s unschooled because unschooling, by it&#39;s nature, fosters critical, clear thinking in all members of the family. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; So she said she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m in the UK. I used to do autonomous learning thinking it was the same thing by another name. I was wrong - it isn&#39;t the same.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; also that you can offer suggestions - while at the same time having no agenda - which again is a fine line, because if you’re looking at getting change at the shop like an opportunity to be doing math when the child hasn’t asked anything, that’s can be a bit pushy and it is having an agenda. But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be.&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you understand unschooling, you&#39;ll realise that these are not a fine lines at all. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot; But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you really understood unschooling, you&#39;d see that this sentence isn&#39;t true at all. If I answer my child&#39;s questions about money, I&#39;m not doing maths with them without saying the word &#39;maths&#39;, I&#39;m simply answering her questions. If a colleague asked me to explain to her how to do a drug calculation, I wouldn&#39;t think I was doing maths with her, I would think I was showing her how to do a drugs calculation. It&#39;s no different with my children. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Sometimes unschoolers will talk in those terms to explain to those new to the concept how children learn these things without schooling. But they&#39;re not actually thinking about their children&#39;s lives and learning in those terms)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And uschooling is the very opposite of neglectful parenting and those who think it is anything like it or close to it are totally misunderstanding it. Some people misunderstand unschooling and do it wrong and end up neglecting their children, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re not taking the time to learn about unschooling properly. They&#39;re reading a couple of things about it, thinking it sounds cool and that they get it and then stepping back and letting their kids do their own thing, expecting them to learn everything from social norms to advanced calculus by magic. Sometimes they come to realise things have become chaotic, blame unschooling (instead of their flawed understanding) and suddenly enforce loads of rules and lessons, which confuses and messes up the children even more. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So listen to Sandra. It is so, so important to put the work into really understanding unschooling and into moving slowly. Go back to Pam Larrichia&#39;s introductory emails and read her books.

Which is why all I‘m doing about this swimming thing is work on myself about my fears related to non-swimmers and pools! It’s incredible how fast people drown - and&nbsp;how silent it is. In some stories, the parents were really close to the pool and didn’t notice anything. Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned.<div><br>&quot;Would you teach reading and figure kids will pick up history?” Some people I know do :-) Though of course they aren’t saying they’re Unschooling. This reminds me of a&nbsp;lovely mother of 6 children I met in the UK, at HES FES (the Home&nbsp;Educators Summer Festival.) Her children were aged 3 weeks old to 12 when I met her. She told me that she felt like she had to teach&nbsp;them reading, writing and basic maths so that they could be fully autonomous. She said that having so many children, she felt like it was&nbsp;important for them to be able to seek the information by themselves, and that when you can read, nothing can stop you from learning and you can do it by yourself. So she said&nbsp;she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling), though she felt like she was empowering her kids to&nbsp;be really autonomous. (She was also talking about how she’d noticed that before the age the 6, it was so easy for them to learn to read, whereas&nbsp;after 6 they started to be self-conscious and it became more difficult.)<br><br><div>She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be. She said, when do you know you&#39;re doing autonomous learning and you’re not neglecting your kids? She said sometimes parents thought they&nbsp;were doing Autonomous Learning and they were just leaving their kids abandoned to themselves.<br>Which I think is something Pam describes in the dangers of using the term Child-Led Learning, which can lead to misinterpretations.<br>https://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/<br><br>The last paragraph is : &quot;Calling it “child-led learning” gives&nbsp;the wrong impression. It leads to people thinking unschooling means waiting for a child to tell the parent, “I want to do math.”&nbsp;That’s not at all how it works.”<br><br>I’d like to be sure I’m understanding what Pam means.&nbsp;</div><div>So: First, while we parents are obviously not saying “Let’s do math now”, we can still have, for example, fun math related games available and offer to play with them (accepting the idea that a particular child might never be interested in a specific game.)

Not the smooth recognisable strokes that we think of as &#39;swimming&#39;, but they were safe, confident and secure, even when the wave machine was on :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a very strong swimmer when I was younger and also did lifesaving courses, etc.  I still recall swimming lessons with a vague sense of dread, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; On 4 Feb 2016, at 04:42, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claramont@...\">claramont@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to treat swimming like other things one can chose to learn one day - or not.

The printed word is everywhere. Their favorite things (like video games) may have words they need to recognize in order to play. They&#39;re being read to. Other types of stories (TV, movies, audio books) are all around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo learn to swim kids need easy, casual experiences with a pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrowing up we had a small free standing pool. It was only 2 feet deep and 10 feet across. It wasn&#39;t enough to really swim but enough to get used to floating, trying out strokes, opening my eyes underwater all while playing and trying all sorts of things out. Not all were directly connected to swimming. We played games so some was social. We played with water and what bodies can do in water so some was science. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 6 we bought a cabin at a small resort in the mountains where they had a pool we could use on the weekends. That&#39;s where I got to expand on my paddling about with some bigger personal challenges to tackle. I would watch others for new ideas and to see how they did things. My strokes improved. My underwater swimming improved. I figured out how to jump off the side, dive off the side, eventually got brave enough to use the diving board.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all very casual, never any lessons, and I&#39;m a good enough swimmer that no one needs to worry about me around a pool ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned because I was having fun playing in the pool. Right now you&#39;re treating learning to swim as something to soothe your fears. Why would that be incentive for your son to learn to swim?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky","from":"Alex & Brian Polikowsky &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Swimming versus reading","postDate":"1454569499","msgId":76658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1REZGRjdBLUE4NUUtNEU0RC05MEFFLTA5RjI3MDQwOTM5REB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzRDlBQjM0LUY2QzEtNEM4Ri04Q0M0LUFDNjMxMjQ3RjAxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG44dWhiYysxMnZvYWluQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDAzRDlBQjM0LUY2QzEtNEM4Ri04Q0M0LUFDNjMxMjQ3RjAxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76657,"nextInTopic":76659,"prevInTime":76657,"nextInTime":76659,"topicId":76654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As someone who grew up by the beach and with a pool I can say that learning to swim is no guarantee the person/child will not drown.

More useful and possibly life-savingly useful than any non-medical people present, even first-aiders. First-aiders know what to do in theory but probably have never done it in real life. They&#39;re not as familiar as I am with equipment and unlikely to be as quick as I would be at assessing the situation and they&#39;re likely to be very scared.

My daughter (at 1 1/2 year old) and I&nbsp;were&nbsp;both sitting by a pool, fully dressed in winter clothes, when she decided to dive in. I jumped in and got her at the bottom (but somehow my mind took the time to have me say“shit!” before I jumped in, as my son later&nbsp;pointed out!), I took her out, she nursed a bit and was totally&nbsp;fine. I happened really fast and I was so glad I was&nbsp;literally *right there*. Which of course I want to be with a&nbsp;non-swimming child near a pool.</div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">But anyway I thought it was interesting how when there’s security involved - possibly life - it’s harder not to be impatient :-) I want to treat swimming like other things one can chose to learn one day - or not. I know adults who never chose to learn to swim, and I need&nbsp;to live with the fact that my son may never choose to learn to&nbsp;swim. I wasn’t given the option, as a child.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">Now I can hear some voices (outside from the Unschooling, Mindful Parenting world) say,&nbsp;“A good&nbsp;thing you weren’t, it was for your own good, it’s an important life-saving skill!” &nbsp;I guess they will choose whether they want this important life-saving skill to be a part of their toolkit. Yes, it’s easier to learn to&nbsp;swim as a child, but you can learn at any age.</div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">Any thoughts?</div><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">Thanks,</div><p><span></span></p><div style=\"font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;\">Clara</div><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1602071746yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76745,"nextTopicId":76769}}
