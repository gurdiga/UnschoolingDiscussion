I guess it was one of<br/>\nthose &quot;lack of a better term&quot; moments. I agree that drug companies do keep<br/>\nus in the dark. All I was saying is that tampons, like so many other things<br/>\nin our lives can be useful (esp. if you swim) and that they do work well for<br/>\na lot of people (myself included). I would never discourage any of my<br/>\ndaughters from using them if they wanted to. Perhaps I go overboard in the<br/>\nempowering women thing, but I&#39;d like my daughters  to be able to use them if<br/>\nthey want.

You can&#39;t make informed<br/>\n&gt; choices if you don&#39;t have the information/knowledge to make those choices.<br/>\n&gt; As one acquires more information/knowledge, one frequently finds that the<br/>\n&gt; choices they made in the past are not the choices they would make in the<br/>\n&gt; present.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, TSS is similar to tetenus and blackleg in the environment it needs to<br/>\n&gt; cause problems and putting something on the outside of a body will have<br/>\n&gt; nothing to do with one acquiring any of the above unless one puntures a<br/>\n&gt; spot that they are on.  All take a closed environment (lack of oxygen)<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; has been traumatized--puncture wounds are the norm for tetenus, the<br/>\nscrapes<br/>\n&gt; and pinches caused by the plastic applicators of the major culprit tampons<br/>\n&gt; created the environment for TSS, a bruise is the norm for blackleg.  And,<br/>\n&gt; it should be noted that the tampons with the plastic applicators were the<br/>\n&gt; ones that were pulled and that other tampon makers were only required to<br/>\n&gt; print a warning statement on their packages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: K WORTHEN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 2:48 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just curios to know... how many of the people that are against the<br/>\n&gt; use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of tampons use or have used disposable diapers on their children?
