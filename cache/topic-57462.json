But we can&#39;t help you with that since it<br/>\nisn&#39;t the goal of the people wanting unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want them to learn from life then imposing structure will interfere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you start? How do you find what there intrests are?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By listening to them. By not filtering what they are interested in through<br/>\nschoolish eyes. For instance, a beloved cartoon is just as valuable *to the<br/>\nchild* as an interest that resembles something taught in school. It&#39;s we<br/>\nadults who tend to focus on the interests society says are important. To<br/>\nnurture who the child is and who she is growing into, we need to honor what<br/>\ninterests *her*, not what she&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to be interested in or what it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; to be interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I keep<br/>\n&gt; gathering books on things my daughter is intrested, puzzles, and art<br/>\n&gt; supplies. She is 2 and will be 3 in may. She counts to ten, abc&#39;s, shapes<br/>\n&gt; colors, loves art airplanes and vehicle bugs, all the normal things. Lately<br/>\n&gt; though she wants plants and things instead of toys. I find this a little<br/>\n&gt; strange. However I did buy the plant! Flowers are great and she helps water<br/>\n&gt; the plants now.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*Don&#39;t* think it&#39;s strange. Think it&#39;s uniquely her! :-) Would you prefer<br/>\nyour child to be &quot;normal,&quot; that is like some cookie-cutter standard?<br/>\n<br/>\n*Celebrate* the things she enjoys. See the world through her eyes. Why<br/>\n*should* a child be more interested in ABC&#39;s than plants?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at 2 I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about what her interests are. Certainly<br/>\nbuy her plants and point out VW Bugs and whatever she enjoys, but don&#39;t<br/>\nworry that you need to feed her interests right. She doesn&#39;t have the<br/>\ncapacity to &quot;learn&quot; as we think of older kids learning. It&#39;s more<br/>\nexperiential and just absorbing things. (I know my daughter absorbed stuff<br/>\nabout dinosaurs spongelike starting at about 18 mos.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they *need* at 2 is you. They need to know they are loved and that you<br/>\nlove spending time with them.

I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe that unschooling is the best way to live.  I&#39;ve been changing<br/>\nhow<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; relate to my children, not that I was a mean and nasty mom, but I talk<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them in a way that makes them on my level, and not treated like the<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My children are very close in age (13 months apart), and are very close<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each other.  I&#39;ve seen how they treated each other in the past, which<br/>\n&gt; mimiced<br/>\n&gt; &gt; how I treated them, and I didn&#39;t like it.  My children need to show lots<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; love and respect for each other and they can learn that from me.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever introduced myself.  I just started butting in on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; converstations.  My name is Patti.  I have a girl named Natalie and a<br/>\nboy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; named Nicholas.  I decided when my daughter was about 2 that I was going<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homeschool my children.  My husband immediately loved the idea.  I<br/>\nstarted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reading a lot about homeschooling and went to my first conference last<br/>\n&gt; &gt; summer.  I knew I wasn&#39;t going to be a &quot;traditional&quot; homeschooler<br/>\nbecause<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; main reason why I wanted to homeschool was, and is, because children<br/>\nlearn<br/>\n&gt; &gt; best if they direct their own learning.  The thought of using<br/>\ncurriculums,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tests, worksheets, etc. and have a set schedule to have my children<br/>\nlearn<br/>\n&gt; was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; never going to be an option, unless my children love that way of<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; When deciding to homeschool, I realized that I was going to have to let<br/>\n&gt; some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things go in order for the family to love each other, respect each<br/>\nother,<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a long, and live together.  I&#39;ve never been one who dictated what my<br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can and cannot do in regards to playing.  I&#39;m used to the HUGE messes<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; &gt; most of the time it doesn&#39;t bother me.  When I started reading about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling, it made me want to learn more about it and talk to families<br/>\n&gt; who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; live this way.  I liked what I heard and decided I want to be an<br/>\n&gt; unschooler.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This board has explained it, and has taught me a lot about families and<br/>\n&gt; how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they should be.  I&#39;ve already noticed a change in how we relate to each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other, although it&#39;s more difficult to help my daughter and son relate<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; &gt; each other in a respectful manner because they get so mad at each other.<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think in time they&#39;ll learn to communicate with each other without<br/>\n&gt; yelling,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taking things away from each other, and hitting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again for all your help!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Patti<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Hiding things she doesn&#39;t want me to take<br/>\n&gt; away or books that need to be returned to the Library. She knows her<br/>\n&gt; alphabet and counts to ten. knows shapes and colors. 1+1=2. She tries to<br/>\n&gt; hide what she knows from me. ? is this normal!! One for u one for me is 2.<br/>\n&gt; (oops) She is telling me the shapes of things. Cant keep her occupied.<br/>\n&gt;  Her brother and her get along great. She is encouraging him to talk and<br/>\n&gt; walk but the fight only for my attention. Any advice on how to stop this?<br/>\n&gt; What can I do to occupie them ?<br/>\n&gt; What advice can you give me on raising children so close in age. How do I<br/>\n&gt; make her feel like a big girl?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Jolene is 2 1/2 and Eddie is 23 mths. 14 mths apart<br/>\n! Eddie to mths premie wouldnt know it now though. Big for his age! Little<br/>\nslow at walking but talkin up a storm. Starting use sentences  of 5 wrds<br/>\nalready.Has very fine motor skills and is very textile.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy attitude has changed a bit too. I am starting to enjoy them a bit more<br/>\nnow reading stories and a lot of art they both love finger paint and art<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if there was an age you started at or was it more of gradual<br/>\nthing? Go on what they want? I am thinkin the less structure and the more<br/>\nfun you can make learning the better. Maybe a little more structure when the<br/>\nreach 6 or 7. Am I on the right track. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57366,"nextTopicId":57580}}
