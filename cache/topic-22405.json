For<br/>\n&gt;some reason all that was in my head about Idaho but I<br/>\n&gt;couldn&#39;t bring it out properly.

I agree that there are a<br/>\nnumber of families in this area whom have some<br/>\ndifferent ideas about things.  I know a number of<br/>\nfolks who are gun owners, and NOT responsible.  I know<br/>\none person who keeps multiple guns in his truck at all<br/>\ntimes, which is stupid, as they are easy to get at by<br/>\npeople other than him.  Indeed a month ago he had his<br/>\ntruck broken into and several guns were stolen,<br/>\nincluding an illegal assault rifle.  I shudder to<br/>\nthink of them in the hands of the burglar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to stress again that there is a peculiar<br/>\nculture in Northern Idaho and nothing surprises me<br/>\ncoming from there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned that they thought there was a<br/>\nconnection between the local government and the folks<br/>\nwanting to own the lakefront property.  I know that<br/>\nmuch of the Sandpoint area, including the Ski Resort,<br/>\nis owned by the Lewis family, whom a dear friend of<br/>\nmine married into.  Small town government tends to be<br/>\nin the hands of prominent citizens, many of whom<br/>\nachieve their prominence through land and asset<br/>\nholdings, business ownerships, etc.  One must also<br/>\nrealize that small resort towns are always striving to<br/>\nimprove their image, their trades and income, their<br/>\nappeal to tourists, etc.  To say &quot;someone&quot; in the<br/>\ngovernemt wants the lakefront property to be developed<br/>\nis silly.  Of course they do.  That does not<br/>\nnecessarily mean that there is a conspiracy afoot, and<br/>\neven if someone or someones are working to affect a<br/>\nless than legal siezure of land, that does not mean it<br/>\nis an overreaching plot amongst the entire staff of<br/>\nthe local authorities in their various offices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not argue that there is nothing fishy going on,<br/>\nas it all seems to have gone down too fast and too<br/>\nconveniently.  That area has as much nepotism as any<br/>\nother tiny resort area, where folks look out for their<br/>\nown.  People who isolate themselves would not have as<br/>\nmuch public sentiment and position as beloved members<br/>\nof the community, to some others in the community<br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!

But I&#39;m also not convinced<br/>\nthat there was dire enough immediate need to warrant police interference to<br/>\n&#39;offer&#39; &#39;help&#39; that was not wanted.  If the police wanted to impound<br/>\ndangerous dogs who are loose as a means of protecting the public, for<br/>\ninstance, that&#39;s one thing.   But to show up with guns and badges,<br/>\npotentially forcing entrance in order to drag away the children in order to<br/>\n&#39;offer assistance&#39; is probably beyond warranted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pleased to note that the police department seems to have gone out of<br/>\ntheir way to enlist the assistance of family friends, rather than resort<br/>\ndirectly to force.  Wish I felt confident that all police officers would<br/>\nreact in such reasonable fashion.  I hope that prosecuting attorneys or any<br/>\nother officials looking into this matter really think about what a threat<br/>\nthese officials represented to these children who were probably terrified<br/>\nbeyond anything they had previously experienced.  Whether others see this as<br/>\na threat or not, these children obviously considered the threat worse than<br/>\ntheir circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have all the answers.  I can only say that having the police<br/>\nforcefully remove me from my home when I was the 16 yr old left in charge of<br/>\nher siblings was an extremely dramatic event in my life.  I still feel the<br/>\neffects and have occasions stemming from this incident when I have to make a<br/>\nvery conscious decision to act rather than react.  It certainly didn&#39;t help<br/>\nme or my family any.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground story...my mother would stay out for days with her boyfriend,<br/>\nleaving me in charge of 4 younger siblings.  Were we neglected?  Definitely.<br/>\nWas it any help or less traumatic to be drug out of the house by<br/>\npolicemen...I don&#39;t think so.  We were returned to our home within less than<br/>\na week and the only thing that changed is that my mother got sneakier.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, I had to save myself by refusing to have a relationship with my<br/>\nparents.  Could foster care or any other government funded program do that<br/>\nfor me before I was ready?  I don&#39;t think so.  Until I was ready and able to<br/>\ndo something for myself, any attempts to &#39;help&#39; would have been useless.  I<br/>\nbelieve the programs need to be there for those who truly need it and/or<br/>\nrequest help.  But I also believe that our society is quick to interfere<br/>\nwithout thinking about whether the standards we so readily accept are really<br/>\nas cut and dried as they appear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, is it better to remove these children and send each of them to<br/>\na separate foster home (assuming any can even be found) or to leave them<br/>\ntogether and relying on each other and whatever resources are still in their<br/>\nhome.  Eating lily pads and/or pond water soup may not be desirable to<br/>\neveryone, but who&#39;s to say this is worse than the alternative.   Sometimes<br/>\nthe hidden injuries are much worse than the obvious external ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust in case anyone thinks differently, I am not in any way advocating that<br/>\nchildren who are being actively abused should be left with abusive families.<br/>\nOTOH I don&#39;t think it does a lot of good to forcibly remove children from an<br/>\nundesirable environment when they obviously do not want help and there is<br/>\nnot real risk of imminent injury.<br/>\n<br/>\nCare must be used in deciding what is better and I&#39;m not convinced that well<br/>\nmeaning officials consistently take the time to really think about which is<br/>\nbetter, &#39;rescuing&#39; or letting things be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have enough first hand information about this case to really know<br/>\nwhether the officials&#39; actions were justified or not.  But I do have enough<br/>\nfirst hand experience to know this will be a traumatic experience for these<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Nanci Kuykendall&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aisliin@...\">aisliin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: June 04, 2001 5:04 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] 6 Kids in Idaho<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You know, at least a part of me is pulling for the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;kids.
