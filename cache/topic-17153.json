When I first started h/s I found that <br/>\nmost of the books in the local library where targeted at the younger <br/>\nchild - my dd was 11yrs old when we started h/s  (moving on to <br/>\nunschool.)  I would have loved a book telling ME about deschooling, <br/>\nwhat to expect, how to motivate, what to do. I couldnt realate to the <br/>\nother books. Even now I wish I had a book that I could read and re-<br/>\nread, some thing that would boost moral.<br/>\nI did read *out of Eygpt (I think thats the name) it was a lovely <br/>\nbook - but it was about above average children - my dd is not above <br/>\naverage<br/>\nSome one else suggested you publish it yourself.  I would imagine <br/>\nthis could be costly - but if you have the money, well worth looking <br/>\ninto.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\nMarianne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17121,"nextTopicId":17163}}
