They used every blanket in the house, and an assortment of pillows.  It was a structure of great beauty and careful planning, with themed rooms and important foodstuffs such as chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  They gave me the crawl through tour, and then we watched part of a DVD on a portable player in the entertainment lobby.  We played, we imagined, we laughed and we talked.  It was glorious.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Some might say that no learning took place, but I would disagree.  I learned something vitally important.  I learned that unschooling has little to do with academics and everything to do with relationship.  We made a memory together that can never be taken away from us.  I learned that life is rich and abundant, and that I am the luckiest mom on the planet.  I learned that even The Wiggles can be funny if you watch them with people you love.  Blessed be.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91955,"nextTopicId":91952}}
