And as I understand <br/>\nit, most of these people went to school and some even graduated! They are <br/>\nexposed to a lot of books, Like unschoolers are, but yet they do not read. I was <br/>\nlaying in bed last night wondering about that! You guys always have such <br/>\nexcellent advice and great comments, I thought Id ask you!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey went to school, you say! Unbelievable! And GRADUATED! My word! Did you <br/>\nknow there was a &quot;non-reading degree&quot; given at a small college here in <br/>\nColumbia, SC? Really. A &quot;non-reading degree&quot;! Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those illiterates have been coerced into learning before they were ready. <br/>\nGiven time, understanding, patience, and the written word, a healthy child <br/>\nwith an engaging parent will inevitably read by playing. It&#39;s just another part <br/>\nof the unschooling world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose that become illiterate adults are not &quot;playing&quot; at reading: they are <br/>\nWORKING at reading. Doing something they find hard and/or unpleasant because <br/>\nsomeone else is forcing them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay will result in learning painlessly. Work will result in resentment and <br/>\navoidance.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":90111,"nextTopicId":90132}}
