My doctor tells me that stress can also cause hypoglycemia, my son<br/>\neven ocasionally gets blinding headaches from this, I think it is when his<br/>\nblood sugar levels plummet.  He almost passed out in an airport a couple of<br/>\nmonths ago, missed his flight and everything, I think he hadn&#39;t eaten much<br/>\nand had just had a very emotional parting:(<br/>\nI wanted to add a positive twist to the explosive type of personality.  My<br/>\nson has always had an intense extreme personality, he doesn&#39;t have a lot of<br/>\nmedium speed, the world is either wonderful or everything is awful.<br/>\nHowever, this means that when he gets involved in something he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndabble he dives right in.<br/>\nMy husband worries about the anger management issues for our son.  It is<br/>\nquite scary when a 140 pounds 5&#39;9&quot; &quot;man&quot; is roaring and raging around the<br/>\nplace.  I have to say that I have noticed though that even when he appears<br/>\nto be out of control these days (including fighting with one of his younger<br/>\nbrothers) he is not really completely out of control.  I have hopes that<br/>\neventually he will be able to stop himself from flying into a rage over<br/>\nsmall frustrations.  It has taken my father about 60 or 70 years to start<br/>\ndoing this:(<br/>\nSusanna<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Knit on, with confidence and hope, through all crises.&quot;<br/>\nElizabeth Zimmermann 1910-2000</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2355","postDate":"1031702313","msgId":43658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzLjFjMGRiOTVjLjJhYWZlMTI5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43657,"nextInTopic":43707,"prevInTime":43657,"nextInTime":43659,"topicId":43656,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/10/2002 7:17:39 AM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

But it makes it easier to get through a <br/>\ntough time when you know there are stages as kids grow up. Remember that your <br/>\n8 yo just thinks the 3 yo will ALWAYS be like this -- no perspective. So <br/>\nanother thing to do is tell him, over and over, that the 3 yo will change, <br/>\nthat this is temporary.

It is human <br/>\nnature to grab at it -- they will do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - yes -- if you give him the message that he can&#39;t even trust himself to <br/>\nknow if he&#39;s hungry or not -- that undermines him taking responsibility for <br/>\nhimself in the future. So never get into the: &quot;Here, you need to eat this <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re cranky.&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m not hungry.&quot; &quot;Yes, I think you are.&quot;.....  <br/>\nkind of power struggle. That would be undermining, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n But - if you put out of tray of cheese and crackers or whatever, and he <br/>\ntakes some and eats it and feels better, you just allowed him to be IN <br/>\ncontrol and do something beneficial for himself. That isn&#39;t undermining - <br/>\nthat is supporting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he DOESN&quot;T eat it and he is still really cranky and hard to get along with <br/>\n-- maybe it is something else and not being hungry.
