The second question, if there is one, is &quot;What curriculum will you<br/>\nbe using?&quot; I tell them we are Unschoolers, and explain that it is<br/>\nchild-led natural learning. It seems pointless to go on about what she<br/>\ncan already &quot;do&quot; as that is schoolish thinking, although sometimes I do<br/>\ntalk about her own learning if the person actually seems interested in<br/>\nUnschooling.

He has talked about wanting to finish first <br/>\ngrade before we homeschool/unschool, so I&#39;m remaining flexible.  (Now that I <br/>\nfeel ready, June seems a *long* time away.

In my imagination, the conversation goes like this.  I <br/>\n(finally) say to his grandma, or the moms I know from school, &quot;Well, we&#39;re <br/>\npulling Fisher out of school.
