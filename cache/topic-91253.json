You can find <br/>\nexciteable responses to such things many places on the internet.  What I&#39;d like <br/>\nto find on this particular list is input that will help other people <br/>\nunschool.   Discussing things in balanced fashion can help that.  Complaining that <br/>\nother people other places are not living up to the ideals unschoolers have is not <br/>\nproductive.  It&#39;s a given; lots of other people suck. &lt;g&gt;  Let us not suck <br/>\nhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIntegrity involves the courage to rise above making decisions based on what <br/>\nwill earn the most applause or the most back-patting.   If we do what we&#39;re <br/>\ndoing and do it well, we will be doing something of great value, regardless of <br/>\n&quot;the competition.&quot;  It could only be better for us to see the value in other <br/>\nhomeschoolers, other &quot;media,&quot; in schools, etc.  To point out their flaws in order <br/>\nto feel better about not being them is not a step toward integrity.   If we <br/>\nsee them as worthy and STILL surpass them, then we&#39;re doing something we might <br/>\nbe proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113787562,"authorName":"Mark and Rheta Wallingford","from":"&quot;Mark and Rheta Wallingford&quot; &lt;wallingford@...&gt;","profile":"belnvivmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"abuse of truth (was law & order)","postDate":"1077366081","msgId":91253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDEwMWMzZjg3NSQzNzM4NjI1MCQ3NmQwMDVjZkBXYWxsaW5nZm9yZD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":91264,"prevInTime":91252,"nextInTime":91254,"topicId":91253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What is the abuse of truth and rational thought that you are pointing at? -=- -=-When homeschoolers have a kneejerk reaction and deny any whiff of ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-196958535\">-=-What is the abuse of truth and rational thought that you are pointing<br/>\nat? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-When homeschoolers have a kneejerk reaction and deny any whiff of<br/>\nsuggestion<br/>\nof negatives, it doesn&#39;t create better balance.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nShowing only the negative aspects of homeschooling isn&#39;t balance either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-&quot;The media&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything.
