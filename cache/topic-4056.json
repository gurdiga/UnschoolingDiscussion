","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-895797091\">Hi, Helen!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in New York, and for reporting purposes (and assessment purposes)<br/>\nwe use Clonlara School.  Some unschoolers loathe them, others love them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have found them to be helpful to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey offer a curriculum, but they suggest families modifiy it to their own<br/>\nneeds.  Also, they do believe in a child led learning, and learning through<br/>\nlife experiences.  They do not &quot;believe&quot; in text books (per se), but<br/>\nrespect a families choice to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nClonlara not only assists homeschoolers, but has a private accredited<br/>\nschool as well, which gives them some credability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey offer a high school diploma (which some recognize, others don&#39;t.  But<br/>\nfor answering relatives, and the world in general, you can say they are<br/>\ngraduating through a private school.  As for colleges, you may still want<br/>\nto go for the GED, or just take those SAT&#39;s - depends on the school.)  Your<br/>\nchildren can even tell folks they are enrolled in Clonlara school, without<br/>\nlying, if they are being hassled.  (we have always told people that we are<br/>\nhomeschoolers, and our son says it proudly.  We are thinking of just saying<br/>\nwe are enrolled with a private school, because we have already had busy<br/>\nbodies report us to social services, because we homeschool!  We&#39;re getting<br/>\ntired of the hassle.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, IF it becomes important for your children to attend a graduation,<br/>\nClonlara has a graduation each year, for their graduating students.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nheard wonderful things of it.  I&#39;ve heard some unschoolers denounce this<br/>\npractice.  Personally, I feel it depends on the child&#39;s desire.  I have a<br/>\nfriend who has her children enrolled in Clonlara.  So far, one wants to go<br/>\nfor the ceremony, the other has no desire for it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, if your interested (or just want to inquire), Clonlara&#39;s phone<br/>\nnumber, addres, and web page are:<br/>\n<br/>\nClonlara School<br/>\n1289 Jewett, Ann Arbor, MI 48104<br/>\n734-769-4511<br/>\nFAX: 734-769-9629<br/>\nEmail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clonlara@...\">clonlara@...</a><br/>\nWEB SITE ADDRESS: www.clonlara.org<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can ask them to mail you a packet of info.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this is helpful or useful to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane<br/>\n<br/>\n____________<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n   Date: Sun, 24 Oct 1999 19:11:19 -0700<br/>\n   From: Helen Martiniuk &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plumplus@...\">plumplus@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: highschool diploma?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to examine all the options.
