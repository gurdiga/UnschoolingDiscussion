It&#39;s actually kinda nice knowing <br/>\nI&#39;m not the only one that stays up till the wee hrs. of the morning before <br/>\ncompany comes over. The scary part where I start crying is when someone calls <br/>\nand says, &quot;I&#39;ll be right over.&quot; That really stresses me out espeacialy if <br/>\nit&#39;s my husbands family! I live in an apartment with 3 children it&#39;s not that <br/>\neasy keeping everything clean. The way I see it is why take time to wash <br/>\nevery few dishes that fall in the sink when I can load up the dishasher once <br/>\na day (hopefully). When I have extra energy days every now and then I&#39;m happy <br/>\nto do a thorough job of cleaning.  We eat, we are clean, have clothes to <br/>\nwear, and are happily enjoying life. Until someone comes over! hehe:-) I too <br/>\nhave to work on not stressing so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\n Vanessa<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=K1634&gid=1290955&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=K1634&gid=1290955&quot;</a>&gt;Shop:Usborne Books&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59493,"nextTopicId":59503}}
