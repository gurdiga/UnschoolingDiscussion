I wanted to share what happened. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids didn&#39;t go with me. Megan and Gracie were<br/>\nnapping; Sarah and Logan decided not to go at the last<br/>\nminute. I missed them, and wish they had come. They&#39;d<br/>\nhave enjoyed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I did my part, I left the group to go to the<br/>\npotty. I was stopped by a gentleman who asked for my<br/>\nname to run with my picture in the paper. He asked if<br/>\nI was the CG spouse who&#39;d been mentioned, and I said I<br/>\nwas. It turns out that the gentleman is the Public<br/>\nAffairs Officer for Activities NY. We began talking,<br/>\nand next thing I knew he gave me the opportunity to<br/>\nwrite about the event for the newspaper! He also<br/>\nmentioned having other events he&#39;s supposed to cover<br/>\nbut he&#39;s so busy that it&#39;s difficult, and if I&#39;d like<br/>\nto, I can attend and write about them as well! <br/>\n<br/>\nElizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
