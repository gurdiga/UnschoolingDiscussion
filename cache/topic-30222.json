For years,the money issue would come <br/>\nup...we did without financial gain because we believe so strongly in <br/>\nhsing. We were unable to participate in the xmas gift exchange among <br/>\nmy siblings (all doing financially well) and *none* of them seemed to <br/>\nunderstand. In fact, they would treat me as a lesser person (imo) <br/>\nbecause of it. Well, I worried about it for years. I finally realized <br/>\nI love my siblings but I love my kids more and I refuse to worry <br/>\nabout the opinions of my siblings any longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe a lot of us hsers have had to make a choice between <br/>\nsibling/parent relationships and our own families. Maybe that&#39;s why <br/>\nwe (I)  feel such a need for community here and on other lists of <br/>\nthis type. Like family, we can argue and disagree but  please... <br/>\nlet&#39;s not cross that line to personal insults and judging others. We <br/>\nall have enough of that in our own families! ;-)<br/>\nHappy Holidays,<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n~xx~ ~xx~ ~xx~<br/>\nSarah Carothers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:puddles@...\">puddles@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, 24 Dec 01 18:19:14 -0500, Kolleen wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We took a major change in our life to afford this.
