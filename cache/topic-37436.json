And teaching means a teacher leading someone along a<br/>\nparticular pathway to a particular destination. In order to get unschooling<br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to have the false connection between teaching and learning<br/>\nsevered so people can start bulding a new model of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo calling &quot;making yourself available&quot; teaching might be a fun debate about<br/>\nthe malleability of the English language, I think it might just be confusing<br/>\nfor people trying to get the concept of learning without teaching. The<br/>\nimportant part of the process that new unschoolers need to grasp is the<br/>\ncentral core to learning is what happens inside the learner, not whatever<br/>\nthe teachers (passive or otherwise) are doing outside the learner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that the environment isn&#39;t important in unschooling. It&#39;s very<br/>\nimportant.

His attitude of<br/>\n&quot;just show me *one* way to do this *one* thing&quot; would not fill anyone with<br/>\nconfidence that he would embrace technology at all. But he&#39;s also got a fax,<br/>\nanswering machine, cel phone and a beeper. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a lot, I think, has to do with need and a willness to try new things<br/>\nrather than early training. I suspect my father just doesn&#39;t have a need the<br/>\nway my father in law does.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105701324,"authorName":"Anji Henderson","from":"Anji Henderson &lt;vual77@...&gt;","profile":"vual77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Computers...??....","postDate":"1022348366","msgId":37436,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNTI1MTczOTI2LjkyNDc0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MTA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjIzMjQ5MTEuMzUwLjIyMzkyLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37438,"prevInTime":37435,"nextInTime":37437,"topicId":37436,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1646703105\">&lt;&lt;By the time our kids are using computers in work<br/>\nsituations, excel <br/>\nspreadsheets and Access databases, etc., are pretty<br/>\nlikely to be passe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once a cobol and fortran programmer.

Doesn&#39;t the manipulation of older<br/>\nprograms help with today&#39;s programs?? I started in<br/>\ngood ol DOS before the Web was a household name..<br/>\nBefore the web had pictures and flash and Java and<br/>\nall... It helps to know what is happening behind the<br/>\nscenes that a lot of people don�t even know is even<br/>\nthere ... I think children should be taught<br/>\nextensively on today�s computers because it will only<br/>\nbe harder to fix/work with later.. Kind of like<br/>\ntalking to a new born.. Its important.. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a professor that moved to AK .. He started<br/>\nworking on computers at the age of 60 because the<br/>\ncollege required that e-mail was done and that the<br/>\nreports came out in a specific WP format... That was<br/>\nwhen he couldn&#39;t &quot;get over&quot; by using a good old<br/>\nfashion typewriter, Mercy!! And I&#39;ll tell you it is<br/>\nmighty difficult to explain to him what went wrong<br/>\nknowing he has absolutely no background with programs<br/>\nand how they work.. <br/>\n<br/>\nPMFJI with out saying HI..
