NOT at all what I meant. Rather, <br/>\nwe are continuously trying to find ways to do things that we usually <br/>\nfind a drag in a way that&#39;s more fun and less stressful. And also, <br/>\ntalking about exactly why we hate certain things. For example, my <br/>\nparents forced me to do dishes immediately after dinne, no matter <br/>\nwhat. No delay and spankings if I didn&#39;t comply. As a result I truly <br/>\nhate doing dishes. But dh has no particular feeligns about it. SO he <br/>\ndoes them all the time, and I do things he dislikes for various <br/>\nreasons. CC was inspirational in that it really brought home the fact <br/>\nthat it is our attitudes towards chores that make them a bummer, not <br/>\nthe chores themselves...and by analysing thoe attitudes we can <br/>\nactually learn to truly enjoy many things!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even on a boat with all the many &quot;Have to&quot; conditions, you could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>STILL decide <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not to do them, and risk the consequences.

Our son, <br/>\n2yrs in a week, is a happy, curious, smart and very loving little guy <br/>\nwith a passion for books, painting, anything with an engine and <br/>\nhousehold &quot;work&quot;. He loves cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and <br/>\ngardening. We, my husband and I, are NOT as passionate about those <br/>\nthings, but we try to live life in a more cheerful and positive way <br/>\nthan what was passed down to us from our upbringing, part of which is <br/>\na distaste of all things household related.

One big inspiration has been <br/>\nreading the Continuum Concept, but before that we were already on this <br/>\npath. We are trying to make our life as independent as possible of <br/>\nsocietal structures, but without isolating ourselves. Hence, we want <br/>\nto live on our boat, unfettered by power companies, water pipes, <br/>\ngasoline and mass produced schooling. But we also love the internet, <br/>\nuse whatever resources are available (libraries, paly centers for kids <br/>\netc) to enrich our lives. But it is at times hard. We do feel &quot;weird&quot; <br/>\nin the eyes of others, and end up unfortunately a bit socially <br/>\nisolated. And one of our big concerns is the rpessure from society to <br/>\nput him in a school. I went to a Waldorf school for part of my <br/>\nschooling and loved it. But we are looking in to home-based education <br/>\nfor our son, and are looking for information and inspiration...glad to <br/>\nhave found you all, look forward to soaking in widom and getting to <br/>\nknow you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nBecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109228,"nextTopicId":109221}}
