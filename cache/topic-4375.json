The first is about the stifling &quot;code&quot; which boys are<br/>\nraised under in this culture.  This code in many ways is a code of silence.  The<br/>\nlearned inability to express feelings (except mad) openly.  The derision that<br/>\nawaits any boy who expresses all of his feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is a parsing apart of &quot;covert male depression&quot; which is amazingly<br/>\nwidespread.  There are all these families with depressed men wherein the men do not<br/>\nexperience their depression directly but inflict it on their families in a blind<br/>\nfashion which corrodes relationships.  The assignment would appear, for men, to be<br/>\nexperiencing pain in order to be freed from it. The unexpressed grief, among other<br/>\nfeelings, of men is like an affliction on the world.  Men often act out in some<br/>\nform of violence that which they will not experience directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to get some feed back from people on these books.

He is turning 5 in a couple<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;weeks, and wants a backpack carrier for his baby.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Natural Baby used to carry one, but don&#39;t anymore.

Let me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; say though, that it is nice to hear someone else who has a son who is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; attached to his doll(s.)  I get those same sideways looks and amused smiles<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from my ex-playgroup aobut my son&#39;s dolls as I do about him kissing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other children (boys too!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; An uncomfortable sort of, &quot;Oh!  You&#39;re teaching him to be sensative!  Well<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I suppose it&#39;s allright at this age, but he&#39;ll be too old for that sort of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing soon.  And you don&#39;t want to encourage that sort of un-masculine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; behavior too long....&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It really sickens me, and was the last straw for me with that previous<br/>\n&gt; &gt; group.  I mean, why should boys be treated differently simply by virtue of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the fact that they are boys?  I believe in treating each child as an<br/>\n&gt; &gt; individual and parenting them each to their unique personalities and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interests, not directing their play and guiding their interests.  Luckily I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have a very wonderful husband who does not feel that his or his sons&#39;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; masculinity are threatented in any way by being sensative, showing emotion,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or doubt, being caring and affectionate, etc.  Our boys play rough and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tumble sometimes, but they are just as likely to want a cuddle, to nurture<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or parent their dolls or stuffed animals, or play cooking as they are to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; play sports or build with blocks.  I hope to raise them to be well rounded<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and whole men, not particularly macho men.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Nanci K. in Idaho<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it out!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>--<br/>\nbest wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html\">http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
