I am new to this list, I started homeschooling my 2 <br/>\n&gt;  children this past year and we have really enjoyed it! I think I am <br/>\n&gt;  lucky to live in Kansas, where we don&#39;t have to report to state <br/>\n&gt;  officials or school districts. (other than the initial filing with <br/>\n&gt;  the KDoE)I do have a ? though, does anyone know of a support group <br/>\n&gt;  specfically for unschoolers, in the Topeka area? I have checked out <br/>\n&gt;  the two I have found, and they both ask for a signed statement of <br/>\n&gt;  faith, and one costs quite a bit to join, and requires you to test <br/>\n&gt;  your child using the CAT. I was very put off by this since the state <br/>\n&gt;  doesn&#39;t require me to test my children I found it hard to take that a <br/>\n&gt;  supposed support group would require it. (But then that is my <br/>\n&gt;  oppinion.) If no one knows of a support group in my area, how would I <br/>\n&gt;  go about starting one? What would I expect in starting one? I <br/>\n&gt;  wouldn&#39;t even want anything fancy, just a small group of folks to get <br/>\n&gt;  together, go to the park for the kids, support/help and friendships <br/>\n&gt;  for the adults. No statements of faith, no testing... really don&#39;t we <br/>\n&gt;  all do this to avoid having to follow someone else as much as <br/>\n&gt;  possible?

I am new to this list, I started homeschooling my 2 <br/>\nchildren this past year and we have really enjoyed it! I think I am <br/>\nlucky to live in Kansas, where we don&#39;t have to report to state <br/>\nofficials or school districts. (other than the initial filing with <br/>\nthe KDoE)I do have a ? though, does anyone know of a support group <br/>\nspecfically for unschoolers, in the Topeka area? I have checked out <br/>\nthe two I have found, and they both ask for a signed statement of <br/>\nfaith, and one costs quite a bit to join, and requires you to test <br/>\nyour child using the CAT. I was very put off by this since the state <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require me to test my children I found it hard to take that a <br/>\nsupposed support group would require it. (But then that is my <br/>\noppinion.) If no one knows of a support group in my area, how would I <br/>\ngo about starting one? What would I expect in starting one? I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even want anything fancy, just a small group of folks to get <br/>\ntogether, go to the park for the kids, support/help and friendships <br/>\nfor the adults. No statements of faith, no testing... really don&#39;t we <br/>\nall do this to avoid having to follow someone else as much as <br/>\npossible?
