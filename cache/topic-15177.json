My children are 3 1/2 and almost 1 and I have never been<br/>\n&gt; comfortable doing a family bed, nor has my husband.  HOWEVER, this past year<br/>\n&gt; is the first time I have been a SAHM and I have noticed GREAT differences<br/>\n&gt; between my children.  My dd was sorta put into a routine because of our work<br/>\n&gt; schedule...because we all needed to be up and out of the house by 7 she was<br/>\n&gt; very tired by about 8:00 at night.  My ds on the other hand has never needed<br/>\n&gt; a schedule but watching him closely I find he is tired and ready for bed by 7<br/>\n&gt; or 7:30 -- the great difference is that my daughter slept through the night<br/>\n&gt; starting at about 8 weeks and my son STILL is getting up 2 or 3 times a night<br/>\n&gt; for mostly snuggling but will nurse when offered.  Both my children were or<br/>\n&gt; are being breastfed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, to my thoughts and questions:  my son has been sick with a very high<br/>\n&gt; fever over the last few days and I have been bone tired becasue he is<br/>\n&gt; constantly awake at night and only wants to be held...obviously, I brought<br/>\n&gt; him into bed with us so I could attempt to get some shut-eye.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  WELL, I need to know HOW to co-sleep with my son...he tosses and turns and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid he will get caught up in the pillows and/or the sheets...I<br/>\n&gt; physically do not know the best way to get started and get him comfortable.<br/>\n&gt; Any ideas would be great.  Also, anyone here ever start a family bed with an<br/>\n&gt; older child (if you count over 1 older!!)?  I&#39;m curious to know how to get us<br/>\n&gt; all comfortable becasue I have a feeling he would sleep better knowing I was<br/>\n&gt; next to him.  And I have already been through the list of &quot;techniques&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; getting him to sleep better or longer and either I&#39;m not happy or he&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; happy and no one in our family needs to be unhappy about sleeping.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the long post but I look forward to any discussion or ideas.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Michelle in DE<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cory and Amy Nelson","from":"Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;amynelson3@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XaXWRBMVaxXrTddx_r4Om90Ps3s_o5QSgr7usMoh39QcWh0ZCXRx08h28zhV_k_1UKD1ZqANFBkNYuNDrN4-y6AxQDFxTv08OamYkz1KJgE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Family Bed Question","postDate":"979954416","msgId":15243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2OEU0NzBGLjIwRjYlYW15bmVsc29uM0Bob21lLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNBNjhFMDIwLjUzNzMuNDkyRUQ0QGxvY2FsaG9zdD4="},"prevInTopic":15239,"nextInTopic":15279,"prevInTime":15242,"nextInTime":15244,"topicId":15177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dd has always needed to be touching me, too, when we are sleeping.

I finally thought of putting a<br/>\nsturdy box there with a portable changing table on top (Little Tykes)...very<br/>\nwell padded. This fit snug to the walls and bed. And I put it just slightly<br/>\nlower than the bed so it had 3 &quot;sides&quot;. This worked until they were about 2<br/>\nyears. Then they were too long.

I do not put <br/>\ntheir<br/>\nheads on pillows.  I sleep from the time they are infants under my armpit<br/>\n(this usually works out after breastfeeding thats where they are).  I found<br/>\nwhen they were little if they were under my armpit I could curl my arm<br/>\naround there head and down their sides and keep from dad or older sibling<br/>\ntossing an arm or covers on top of baby/child and if baby was on outside of<br/>\nbed they couldn&#39;t fall out.  Even now my toddler doesn&#39;t sleep on pillows <br/>\nbut is up against me.  Maybe you can try sleeping in spoon fashion.  I<br/>\ntry to dress him a bit warm at night because he does like to kick the <br/>\ncovers off.  I sleep lightly but well (meaning wake up if there is a need<br/>\nbut otherwise get a good nights sleep).  If you have ever nursed lying<br/>\ndown then just think of it as the same thing just at night : )<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cory and Amy Nelson","from":"Cory and Amy Nelson &lt;amynelson3@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"q-zhGn6dcF9urWp8FX2tRygtr43Zb1jwpXTAwNsK_OwAv0SffiTlewsRcpw4MqmHwy_DdZ6v0bUPmaQJll3Y7Kda9rfv_aB0ncW8DLLQbiI","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Family Bed Question","postDate":"979839039","msgId":15187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI2OEM4NDVGLjIwMTglYW15bmVsc29uM0Bob21lLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMzLmQxZDZlOTMuMjc5ODUxZDBAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15184,"nextInTopic":15188,"prevInTime":15186,"nextInTime":15188,"topicId":15177,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Michelle- It could take a couple weeks or even longer for everyone to get comfortable with the family bed if you do decide to try it on a regular basis.

My children are 3 1/2 and almost 1 and I have never been <br/>\ncomfortable doing a family bed, nor has my husband.  HOWEVER, this past year <br/>\nis the first time I have been a SAHM and I have noticed GREAT differences <br/>\nbetween my children.  My dd was sorta put into a routine because of our work <br/>\nschedule...because we all needed to be up and out of the house by 7 she was <br/>\nvery tired by about 8:00 at night.  My ds on the other hand has never needed <br/>\na schedule but watching him closely I find he is tired and ready for bed by 7 <br/>\nor 7:30 -- the great difference is that my daughter slept through the night <br/>\nstarting at about 8 weeks and my son STILL is getting up 2 or 3 times a night <br/>\nfor mostly snuggling but will nurse when offered.  Both my children were or <br/>\nare being breastfed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to my thoughts and questions:  my son has been sick with a very high <br/>\nfever over the last few days and I have been bone tired becasue he is <br/>\nconstantly awake at night and only wants to be held...obviously, I brought <br/>\nhim into bed with us so I could attempt to get some shut-eye. <br/>\n<br/>\n WELL, I need to know HOW to co-sleep with my son...he tosses and turns and <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid he will get caught up in the pillows and/or the sheets...I <br/>\nphysically do not know the best way to get started and get him comfortable.  <br/>\nAny ideas would be great.  Also, anyone here ever start a family bed with an <br/>\nolder child (if you count over 1 older!!)?  I&#39;m curious to know how to get us <br/>\nall comfortable becasue I have a feeling he would sleep better knowing I was <br/>\nnext to him.  And I have already been through the list of &quot;techniques&quot; for <br/>\ngetting him to sleep better or longer and either I&#39;m not happy or he&#39;s not <br/>\nhappy and no one in our family needs to be unhappy about sleeping.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post but I look forward to any discussion or ideas.  <br/>\nThanks for listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle in DE</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15272,"nextTopicId":15280}}
