In our house vegetarian/vegan definitely<br/>\ndoes not equal no/low fat foods.  We eat plenty of<br/>\nwholesome &quot;fatty&quot; foods like avocados, coconut, olives<br/>\nand olive oil, nuts and seeds, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of fats that our bodies need in order<br/>\nto function so if you&#39;re cutting them all out then<br/>\nyou&#39;re body is going to lack in some vital things like<br/>\nEssential Fatty Acids, etc.  HTH  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I was a vegetarian for 7 years before I went all raw foods and being raw makes a big difference!  Therefore, if your going to eat meat, eat it raw or dehydrated or sun-dri it in temp. less than 107 degrees to keep the enzymes in tact.
