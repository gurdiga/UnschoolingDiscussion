She hasn&#39;t formally studied math in AGES and is trying to get herself motivated to pick it up now for both this coming school year and for the ACT or SAT test.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be going to a Waldorf school and I&#39;ve told them we&#39;re not really interested in her actually &quot;graduating&quot; (we&#39;ll probably substitute a home-made diploma for the school&#39;s), so probably the pressure won&#39;t be as great.
