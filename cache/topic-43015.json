My 14 year old<br/>\nis so excited about learning now that he is not in school. He and his 11<br/>\nyear old brother spent most of the day today chasing bees around our<br/>\nyard, talking about them, figuring out that they thought they had caught<br/>\nthe queen bee (hairy) and what that meant, why they were eating a dead<br/>\nmouse, that they have different jobs within the hive, how to smoke them<br/>\nout and why, etc. We listened to Huck Finn on tape. The kids are so<br/>\nexcited. This after 9 years of torture from getting them up in the<br/>\nmorning swearing and running around the house so they could get away. We<br/>\nare not public school people. Michele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43005,"nextTopicId":43019}}
