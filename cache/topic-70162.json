I set myself high standards and then<br/>\nget soooooo disappointed when I fall short. I have come to accept that I<br/>\nwill never be the perfect parent and this has been so freeing! When I mess<br/>\nup, I apologise, still feel disappointed but not devasted and go on.<br/>\nIronically, accepting that I am never going to be the &quot;perfect&quot; parent has<br/>\nenabled me to be a better parent!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal message:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;    Date: Sun, 18 May 2003 20:44:47 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Nicholina ODonnell&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arodonn@...\">arodonn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: One Lurker Says Hi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With all the talk about those who don&#39;t post, I thought I&#39;d introduce<br/>\n </span></blockquote>myself as one of those non-posters, there-by removing myself from that<br/>\ncatigory.  :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking for about a month now and enjoy the list, though<br/>\n </span></blockquote>occationally do mass deletes to catch up.  That is the reason for my lack of<br/>\nposting.  I feel like I should be reading everything to make an informed<br/>\ndecision before putting my 2 bits out there, but just don&#39;t always find the<br/>\ntime to get through them all.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m mom to a 5 year old and have intended not to send her to school nor do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>school at home sense she was about 2 and I discovered unschooling.  I first<br/>\ndiscovered Taking Children Seriously, which, while I think it&#39;s a nice<br/>\nideal, I have some trouble with it.  My problem is if I&#39;m not meeting an<br/>\nideal, I feel like a failure.  Anyway, I try my best to be respectful and<br/>\nthoughful toward Davan and try not to beat myself up too much.  Where I was<br/>\ntrying to go with that was to say, it lead me toward unschooling, which is<br/>\nsomething I can work with and is a great way of life.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to say, though, that lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I am not patient<br/>\n </span></blockquote>and creative enough with problem solving with Davan.  We ended up having<br/>\nquite a bad seance at a store today.  I think Davan was hungry, which led to<br/>\nsome of the difficulties, but it gets me so down when she ends up crying and<br/>\nangry and I end up angry and not the nicest of people in return.  Do any of<br/>\nyou ever feel like you don&#39;t have enough patience for this job?  Sometimes I<br/>\nwonder about myself....<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, here I am, and I imagine that now I&#39;ve broken the ice with my first<br/>\n </span></blockquote>post, there will be more to follow.  :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nicholina<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70072,"nextTopicId":70157}}
