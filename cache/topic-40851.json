The A&E <br/>\nvideo &quot;The Crossing&quot; (George Washington crossing the Delaware) inspired him. <br/>\nHe wanted to feel what it would be like to be a colonial soldier, so he read <br/>\nabout a soldier&#39;s life. Then he built his camp (including campfire), stole <br/>\nbacon from a &quot;local farmer&quot; to cook over his fire, fought the Redcoats, and <br/>\nsurvived multiple musket wounds. He chronicled his days in a journal using a <br/>\ncalligraphy pen (his version of a quill pen). Eric had so much fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the point of my telling you this is maybe creating his own version of <br/>\nevents. Use some of the other great ideas (videos, books, field trips) to <br/>\nhelp figure out what he&#39;d like to recreate.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun,<br/>\nGinny<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40809,"nextTopicId":40853}}
