The kids are 3 <br/>\ngirls age 7, 12 and 16 and all attend public school. The older girls get <br/>\nnear-to-failing grades and their parents ground them, etc...because of the grades. <br/>\nThese girls seem to be very creative and have many interests and don&#39;t care <br/>\nabout school. The youngest is very popular, good grades and fits into the <br/>\nschool life very well. I have heard my friend mention to others that school <br/>\nrequires kids to fit into a certain mold and her oldest two just don&#39;t fit into it <br/>\nwell. Yes, my friend knows we homeschool and she has no interst in trying it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, the middle daughter came up to me at a recent picnic and began <br/>\ntelling me about how much she loves to write stories and poetry. She showed me a <br/>\npoem she wrote that had been published in her school&#39;s journal and spoke very <br/>\npassionately about her writing. I mentioned magazines that are made up of kids&#39; <br/>\nsubmissions and she was so excited. I just feel so bad for her because I just <br/>\npicture how she could flourish as a homeschooler. I got her a kid&#39;s book on <br/>\nwriting poetry and I&#39;m giving her a few back issues of Stone Soup and Creative <br/>\nKids magazines to help encourage her.
