Even though it&#39;ll &quot;SEEM&quot; off-topic:<br/>\n<br/>\nMY SEVEN YEAR OLD CAN READ!!!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were out all day with Leslie and her kids. We went to a unique zoo where <br/>\nmost of the animals are trained and used in TV, movies, and commercials. It was <br/>\na cool day. We got to see and feed some really neat and charming animals, and <br/>\nLeslie and I got in some good chatting to and from Spartanburg while the kids <br/>\nsnoozed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, after we dropped Leslie and her kids off, Duncan and I went to The <br/>\nHappy Bookseller because he wanted a new &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; bookmark (it comes <br/>\nwith a ring you can wear!). While we were there, he asked whether he could get <br/>\na book. Always ready to spend $$$, I said &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got four &quot;readers&quot;---two of SpongeBob SquarePants , one on spiders, and <br/>\none really simple &quot;reader&quot;. The SpongeBob ones were level two, and the others, <br/>\nlevel one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came home, and Duncan asked that we get in bed and read. I started, but he <br/>\nsaid, &quot;No. Let me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nY&#39;all, he READ the books! They weren&#39;t hard (except for the proper <br/>\nnames---Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and SpongeBob (which I guess he &quot;knew&quot;))---but there <br/>\nwere words like: agreed, replied, cried, said, Halloween, ghost, witch, pearl, <br/>\nquickly, scared, afraid, downward, outside, could, would, should.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was cracking up. It was funny---he would &quot;miss&quot; &quot;he&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, but he&#39;d <br/>\nhave no trouble with &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; (I asked how he knew that---he said <br/>\nthat it ended with &quot;man&quot;---like Batman and Spiderman.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been watching me read for years. He&#39;s been knowing when to say the words <br/>\nin bold caps like &quot;BOOM&quot; or &quot;BANG&quot; or &quot;CRASH&quot; or proper names like Harry and <br/>\nHermione. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly ALL the pieces fit! It&#39;s so cool! And we haven&#39;t read in WEEKS! Busy <br/>\nwith the conference, all summer in the pool, new video games, travelling here <br/>\nand there. We take this long hiatus from reading.....and he can read!<br/>\n<br/>\nHad to share.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, mom of a new reader!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":80869,"nextTopicId":81001}}
