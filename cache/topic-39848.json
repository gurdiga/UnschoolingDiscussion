My MIL sent <br/>\nthem both frisbees that are exactly the same. So I gave one to each <br/>\nand wrote their name. Now, Aidan has been seeing his name on his <br/>\ndoor, on his presents, on pictures and especially every time he gets <br/>\nsigned in for computer games. Guess what, he definitely can tell the <br/>\ndifference between his name and his brother&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did the &#39;switch the frisbee&#39; trick and he still picked the right <br/>\none. Our friends did the &#39;behind the back switch&#39; and he still <br/>\npointed to the one with his name. If he finds Evan&#39;s frisbee he drops <br/>\nit and looks for his. Not only that, now he truly recognizes his name <br/>\nELSEWHERE.  As with his name, he now also recognizes the numbers that <br/>\ncome up on our elevator up to 12 because, guess what, we live on the <br/>\n12th floor. Then there is the birthday card incident: We were invited <br/>\nto a neighbor&#39;s b-day and I gave Evan the card to sign. Not to leave <br/>\nThing2 out, I passed the card to him. There are 5 letters in his name <br/>\nand, guess what, he made 5 scribbles, one next to the other and small <br/>\nenough to look like that&#39;s where letters should go. I had nothing <br/>\nlike this with Thing1. To him a paper is still a universe with almost <br/>\nno gravity: His letters look like they are hardly touching a <br/>\nbaseline. This tells me a few things:<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Aidan is soaking up every bit of information that he can get from <br/>\nhis brother<br/>\n(2) He may be benefiting from having a hyper-visual environment with <br/>\nart and computers everywhere<br/>\n(3) He is acquiring the skills that he will need to learn how to read and write<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I say my kids are my own private National Geograhic I am not <br/>\nkidding. It is truly &quot;smashing&quot; how they just are learning so much <br/>\nand taking it all in without my former paradigm of learning (which <br/>\nwas teach, teach, teach). And what is more important is that they are <br/>\nhaving fun with it. Aidan gets excited when he &#39;gets&#39; a new word (he <br/>\nis starting to speak as well).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvan is allergic to any teaching but now is into adding thanks to the <br/>\nPok√©mon board game. And it was not until he got his library card that <br/>\nhe got that when somebody writes, if you know how to you can read <br/>\nthat writing. He signs his name on the Library&#39;s roster of &#39;little&#39; <br/>\nclients . The librarian reads it and says, &quot;Well thank you Evan&quot;. He <br/>\nturns to me and asks, &quot;How come she knows my name?&quot; I said, well <br/>\nbecause she read it off the book after you signed it. He totally <br/>\nflipped.

That law was written in 1650 and is still in<br/>\neffect. The law acknowledges the natural, sacred, unalienable RIGHT and duty<br/>\nthat parents have in the raising of their children -- education being part<br/>\nof that upbringing. As this group and others remind us, homeschooling (at<br/>\nleast learning) goes on in every home in the world -- so what are your kids<br/>\nlearning?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn CT, homeschooling has been an accepted practice for over 350 years. In<br/>\nfact, it was so universal in the early days that when towns organized Common<br/>\nSchools, the schools often did not accept children unless they already knew<br/>\nhow to read, write  and calculate -- skills that were presumed to have been<br/>\ntaught at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to today&#39;s barrage of mostly drivel, the tools for teaching were<br/>\nfew -- reading primers, arithmetic  lessons and penmanship, probably only a<br/>\nfew choices of materials that were familiar to most families. The lessons<br/>\nwere simple. The children were bright, as today, and they learned the<br/>\nlessons easily, quickly and well. For example: put four pennies (or apples)<br/>\non the floor arranged in a square. It&#39;s hard to mistake that 2+2=4 and 1+3.<br/>\nThose lessons are instantly and indelibly printed in a child. No review is<br/>\nneeded, no test required. Ever. But the parent has (dare I say it) taught<br/>\nthe lesson. The child can usually take it from there. Timing is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, when a child needs (wants ! ) to learn how to read, such as in<br/>\nthe recent example of the smaller sister asking her older sibling in bed how<br/>\nto say certain words that she pointed to on the page, such as HOP, one<br/>\nperson was helping the other to learn. It is not unusual that parents are<br/>\nsurprised by the abilities of their kids -- without any teaching. The reason<br/>\nwe are surprised sometimes is that we believe that learning is difficult and<br/>\ntakes a lot of teaching. That is the garbage that schools want us to<br/>\nbelieve, so that we will maintain support for all their employees and<br/>\noutrageous budgets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooler (a staunch, radical, fanatical one) I am vehemently against<br/>\nschooling -- the kind that is done in schools, and is directed by schoolers<br/>\nfor the benefit of the school establishment -- not the children. But that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I am against learning or even teaching, so long as it is asked<br/>\nfor by the learner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, in CT, parents are required by that ancient law to make sure that<br/>\ntheir children are instructed in reading, writing, math, geography, and<br/>\ngovernment. For homeschoolers, nobody is looking over our shoulders, but<br/>\ncitizens need to be aware that their children&#39;s knowledge of those things is<br/>\ntheir responsibility. No tests are required here, parents must determine an<br/>\nacceptable level of information that their kids need to know. The law is<br/>\nkind, saying that parents need to be ABLE TO show that their kids have<br/>\nreceived instruction....it doesn&#39;t say that we MUST show it (to anyone).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that UNschooling is a personal idea. Today&#39;s practice comes<br/>\nprimarily from the work and books of John Holt, who told us years ago that<br/>\nthe trouble with education is the schooling, the boring, life-crushing<br/>\ntedium, the sit-down-shut-up-listen-to-this madness that drives kids crazy,<br/>\nespecially when there&#39;s so little that those places teach and how quickly<br/>\nmost kids can learn it ALL so that they can go out and play and discover how<br/>\nthe world really works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s my point...let&#39;s not thrash each other for not UNschooling. I am not<br/>\nAnti-Unschooling, but I am also not Anti-teaching when a kid asks for that.<br/>\nPurity in unschooling (as some understand it, as *no teaching no matter<br/>\nwhat*) is as much the enemy of learning as school is.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling, for Luz and me, means providing the tools to a child so that<br/>\ncuriosity can be inspired and satisfied, preferably  not by scripted<br/>\nlessons, but more by the initiative and ingenuity of the learner. Becoming<br/>\nour children&#39;s schoolteacher/taskmaster is sure to poison our relationship<br/>\nwith them, but when they ask for specifics, we must not be so hung up on<br/>\nUNschooling that we fail in our responsibility as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible that some parents don&#39;t know HOW to teach what their child<br/>\nwants to know? Sure, it happens a lot. That&#39;s when they need to become<br/>\nlearners right along with the child. For example, I believe that part of the<br/>\nresistance during the phonics discussion/tussle was because some folks are<br/>\nconvinced that Phonics is something that needs to be *taught* (saints<br/>\npreserve us!) and they just weren&#39;t about to do that. But there is also the<br/>\nhint that many people have no idea what phonics is, and school fashion has<br/>\ntold many people that Phonics is boring, repetitive, rote, rulebound,<br/>\nold-fashioned, yadayada. That bad rap makes people fear that it requires a<br/>\nwhole lot of schooling. It&#39;s just not true...it comes from school teachers<br/>\nwho prefer therapy to teaching specific skills that even they are unsure of.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiza sends this brief list from a book that, on its cover, claims to be a<br/>\nhow-to-read book, but inside claims that it&#39;s not a how-to-read book. It<br/>\nturns out to be both. From the book, Liza summarizes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; the 6 ways to read:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;1. Getting help from pictures<br/>\n&gt;&gt;2. Remembering<br/>\n&gt;&gt;3.Sounding out letters<br/>\n&gt;&gt;4.Expecting what comes next<br/>\n&gt;&gt;5.Writing<br/>\n&gt;&gt;6.Making sense<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All of those are straight out of the Whole Language grab-bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you tell me which *way* tells HOW to read. If we want to know what a<br/>\nword sounds like so we can *read* it, we do #3. Being able to read<br/>\naccurately means being able to turn the printed marks into specific familiar<br/>\nsounds. What it&#39;s not is guesswork, although many people believe that<br/>\nguessing at words is just fine.<br/>\nLiza&#39;s book is right: it&#39;s not a how-to-read book when it tells us to use<br/>\npictures for clues (a strategy from whole language), or when it tell us to<br/>\nremember words by their confuguration (look-say-good luck), when it tells us<br/>\nto Expect what comes next (be fortune tellers), use writing (can we write if<br/>\nwe can&#39;t read?), and finally, Making sense...Please, how can it make sense<br/>\nif we can&#39;t read it. Reading is a prerequisite for understanding, not the<br/>\nother way round.<br/>\n<br/>\nLucky for us all, kids find ways to learn on their own despite all the<br/>\nmiseducation we invent and therapies we use to avoid giving specific<br/>\ninstruction, even when it&#39;s begged for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have plenty of contempt for the teaching trade for turning simple learning<br/>\ninto a secretive and corrupt occupation that can now demand huge sums from<br/>\nthe public trough to do terrible things to children. Luz got her masters in<br/>\nEducation and certification from U of Az and agrees that what she learned<br/>\nthere was debilitating, fraudulent and a waste of time -- all of it. Bad<br/>\nteaching methods have become the hallmark of the schooling establishment,<br/>\nand it is affecting even the most independent intelligent people --<br/>\nhomeschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy hope is that we can get back to the common sense of our early settlers<br/>\nand use direct methods to teach simple skills when they are needed and<br/>\nrequested, and then get on with real life. Learning how to read and<br/>\ncalculate each can take only a few minutes, total, perhaps spread out over a<br/>\nfew weeks. John Holt said that all of arithmetic can be learned in a single<br/>\nmorning, by a kid who&#39;s interested.
