 *grin*<br/>\ni thought i would pass on some exerts from and article &quot;an unschooler&#39;s<br/>\nlament:  what&#39;s so hard to understand&quot; by mary griffith (the author of two<br/>\nhandbooks for homeschooling and unschooling).  the article was published in<br/>\nthe mag paths of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;i discovered three elements common to unschooling families:<br/>\n<br/>\nan environment conducive to exploration and experimentation.  to put the<br/>\nmatter bluntly, we unschoolers have lots of stuff around to play with.<br/>\nthe nature of that stuff varies with the interests and needs of each<br/>\nfamily; from books overflowing their shelves, to pots and pans to stack and<br/>\nbang, to backyard garden to cultivate, to a screaming fast computer, our<br/>\nhomes have lots of easily accessible materials around for children to<br/>\ninvestigate.   if we want our kids to learn by following their own<br/>\ninterests, we need to offer them plenty to catch those interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nadults as models and facilitators.  unschooling parents, like most other<br/>\nparents, learn rapidly that &quot;do as i say, not as i do&quot; does not work very<br/>\nwell with children.   unschooling kids need people around them who provide<br/>\nmodels of learning by the way they live and in activities they pursue.   if<br/>\nwe parents are not obviously curious about and interested in the world<br/>\naround us, if we ourselves never ask questions and search for answers, if<br/>\nwe never just try things and see what happens, it&#39;s unlikely that our kids<br/>\nwill do so, either.<br/>\n<br/>\ntrust that children will learn.   for most people, this is the big obstacle<br/>\nto understanding unschooling and allowing it to work.   perhaps the<br/>\nconventional school education that created our own model of learning<br/>\ncreates an impression that learning is supposed to be difficult or boring,<br/>\nor that learning cannot and will not occur unless someone is explicitly<br/>\nteaching, providing information in little age-appro[riate packets, giving<br/>\nquizzes on wednesdays and tests on fridays.   eventually, once we&#39;ve bitten<br/>\nour tongues and sat on our hands and held our breaths long enough to let<br/>\nour kids learn to trust their own abilities, we discover that we can trust<br/>\ntheir abilities as well.   in fact, we discover that it&#39;s almost impossible<br/>\nto stop our kids from learning, that kids, already intensely curious, are<br/>\neager to indulge their curiosity.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nshe goes on to say:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;of course,  even better than applying manufacturing models of more recent<br/>\nvintage than the industrial revolution to education and learning would be<br/>\nto drop the dehumanizing industrial models entirely and start treating both<br/>\nchildren and adult learners as full, active participants in the educational<br/>\nprocess.   in other words, instead of looking at improving instructional<br/>\ndelivery systems or accountability procedures, shouldn&#39;t we talk seriously<br/>\nwith our kids about their particular educational paths, learning from them<br/>\nhow they learn best and what they find helpful or obstructive to their<br/>\nlearning processes?   aren&#39;t our kids entitled to direct a process that<br/>\nprepares them for their own future?&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nshe concludes by saying:<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;however, let me be clear: &quot;because it works&quot; isn&#39;t a sound enough reason<br/>\nfor me to advocate unschooling in particular and, more generally, treating<br/>\nour children as full partners in our lives.   our children are fellow human<br/>\nbeings - they are our colleagues in the making of the world, in the<br/>\ncreation of our joint future.   treating them as fully human, with respect<br/>\nand decency, recognizing them as people just like us, is what we owe them<br/>\nand what we owe ourselves.   it&#39;s simply the right thing to do.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nthough this is purely philosophical  i hope it will be of some use to you.<br/>\nfor me having a strong grasp of the underlining concept helps me work with<br/>\nall the many of variables we face each day.<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Debra Bures","from":"&quot;Debra Bures&quot; &lt;buresfam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Oo9yEHV9kovKAmkowp4Vg1I_qnE1uhVB1-KYlVP7fB9eQT4iZy22QmFyv-fkPDfy2Nq9LFdUtOVl0GWOir-NEUj5ZY8Hd2bQdv3N","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Influences","postDate":"947217779","msgId":5502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNjMuNTUwMi45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5492,"nextInTopic":5507,"prevInTime":5501,"nextInTime":5503,"topicId":5451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My youngest is very much an audio-kinesthetic learner (I put it in quotes--don t anyone yell at me for labelling please!!!)

Brown, Th.M.<br/>\n <br/>\n  My son called me on the phone recently and asked, &quot;Dad, do you know<br/>\n anything about the kids&#39; collector card game Pokemon?&quot; The reason he<br/>\n asked<br/>\n was because my oldest grandson, who is 7 years old, came home with<br/>\n several<br/>\n of the cards he got from a friend at church. He showed them to his dad<br/>\n and<br/>\n said his friends thought &quot;they were really cool.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n After looking at the few cards, his dad had a different opinion. Though<br/>\n he<br/>\n could not put his finger on exactly what the problem was by looking at<br/>\n those few cards, he definitely had an uneasy feeling about them While he<br/>\n neither saw nor read anything overtly evil on the cards, there were a <br/>\n couple of hints on them that made him suspicious. He decided not to<br/>\n allow his son to get involved with Pokemon until he looked into it<br/>\n further.<br/>\n <br/>\n This proved to be a wise decision. Here&#39;s what I discovered.<br/>\n <br/>\n The History of Pokemon<br/>\n The name Pokemon is derived from pocket monster. Pokemon has entertained<br/>\n Japanese youth since 1995. While it is rare for a Japanese cultural<br/>\n phenomena to be duplicated in the Western world, Pokemon has proved to<br/>\n be<br/>\n the exception. Pokemon has moved into the United States &quot;BIG TIME&quot; and<br/>\n captured the minds of elementary aged children all over this country.<br/>\n Pokemon is everywhere. Nintendo video games, cartoon shows on<br/>\n television, a movie, comic books, toys, clothing, VHS videos, DVD&#39;s, and<br/>\n the wildly<br/>\n popular collector card game. The Pokemon &quot;virus&quot; has infected virtually<br/>\n every media outlet imaginable, and by plan, the &quot;virus&quot; has become an<br/>\n epidemic among elementary aged children causing them to crave and beg<br/>\n for more Pokemon paraphernalia. Countless elementary aged children are<br/>\n obsessed with  Pokemon.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Measuring Pokemon By The Bible Without apology, I acknowledge that I am<br/>\n writing this pamphlet from a biblical perspective. And, I believe there<br/>\n ia a battle going on for the minds of our children and grandchildren.<br/>\n <br/>\n In fact, Satan and his diabolical hordes want to corrupt the minds of<br/>\n children and adults as well! One of the problems is that Satan is<br/>\n getting<br/>\n the upper hand because Christians are oblivious to the tactics the<br/>\n adversary is using to pollute the minds of men, women, boys and girls.<br/>\n While many Christian adults would catch blatant demonic doctrines, the<br/>\n truth is, Satan seldom mounts a direct assault.

Brown, Th.M.<br/>\n<br/>\n My son called me on the phone recently and asked, &quot;Dad, do you know<br/>\nanything about the kids&#39; collector card game Pokemon?&quot; The reason he<br/>\nasked<br/>\nwas because my oldest grandson, who is 7 years old, came home with<br/>\nseveral<br/>\nof the cards he got from a friend at church. He showed them to his dad<br/>\nand<br/>\nsaid his friends thought &quot;they were really cool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter looking at the few cards, his dad had a different opinion. Though<br/>\nhe<br/>\ncould not put his finger on exactly what the problem was by looking at<br/>\nthose few cards, he definitely had an uneasy feeling about them While he<br/>\nneither saw nor read anything overtly evil on the cards, there were a <br/>\ncouple of hints on them that made him suspicious. He decided not to<br/>\nallow his son to get involved with Pokemon until he looked into it<br/>\nfurther.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis proved to be a wise decision. Here&#39;s what I discovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe History of Pokemon<br/>\nThe name Pokemon is derived from pocket monster. Pokemon has entertained<br/>\nJapanese youth since 1995. While it is rare for a Japanese cultural<br/>\nphenomena to be duplicated in the Western world, Pokemon has proved to<br/>\nbe<br/>\nthe exception. Pokemon has moved into the United States &quot;BIG TIME&quot; and<br/>\ncaptured the minds of elementary aged children all over this country.<br/>\nPokemon is everywhere. Nintendo video games, cartoon shows on<br/>\ntelevision, a movie, comic books, toys, clothing, VHS videos, DVD&#39;s, and<br/>\nthe wildly<br/>\npopular collector card game. The Pokemon &quot;virus&quot; has infected virtually<br/>\nevery media outlet imaginable, and by plan, the &quot;virus&quot; has become an<br/>\nepidemic among elementary aged children causing them to crave and beg<br/>\nfor more Pokemon paraphernalia. Countless elementary aged children are<br/>\nobsessed with  Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\n Measuring Pokemon By The Bible Without apology, I acknowledge that I am<br/>\nwriting this pamphlet from a biblical perspective. And, I believe there<br/>\nia a battle going on for the minds of our children and grandchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, Satan and his diabolical hordes want to corrupt the minds of<br/>\nchildren and adults as well! One of the problems is that Satan is<br/>\ngetting<br/>\nthe upper hand because Christians are oblivious to the tactics the<br/>\nadversary is using to pollute the minds of men, women, boys and girls.<br/>\nWhile many Christian adults would catch blatant demonic doctrines, the<br/>\ntruth is, Satan seldom mounts a direct assault. Rather, he, through his<br/>\nhuman helpers, uses subtle, clandestine and deceptive methods to advance<br/>\nhis evil doctrines. So, how can we detect these deceptive methods and<br/>\nevil doctrines? How can we protect our children and ourselves?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible says, &quot;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&quot;<br/>\n1 Thessalonians 5:21. The Bible says, &quot;Whatsoever ye do, do all to the<br/>\nglory of God&quot; 1 Corinthians 10:31. The Bible says, &quot;.Abhor that which is<br/>\nevil; cleave to that which is good.&quot; Romans 12:9. Therefore, we must<br/>\nmeasure Pokemon paraphernalia by the principles of the Bible to<br/>\ndetermine if it is acceptable. Let&#39;s do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n What values, beliefs, and philosophies do the game promote?<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the first things I did was to find out who produced the trading<br/>\ncard game. Here is an exact quote right from the Web page of the<br/>\nproducer - &quot;The Pokemon Trading Card Game is a new collectable Card Game<br/>\nthat is made and distributed by Wizards of the Coast. The same company<br/>\nthat made the best selling game ... Magic: The Gathering.&quot; Magic:  The<br/>\nGathering is a heavily occult laced trading card game very popular  in<br/>\nthe 1990&#39;s. I have a research report titled Beware of Magic:The<br/>\nGathering that can be viewed on the Logos Web page at. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html\">http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, I should mention that Wizards of the Coast also owns TSR, the<br/>\nproducers of all the Dungeons & Dragons materials. When I discovered who<br/>\nowned the American Pokemon Trading Card Game rights, I knew the game was<br/>\nnot just an innocent card game for elementary school children.<br/>\n<br/>\n Next, I looked into the characters in the Pokemon video games, comics,<br/>\ncartoons, movies, etc. What kind of values do they have? Ash Ketchum (a<br/>\nboy) is one of the main characters.. He is described as  &quot;an energetic<br/>\nand<br/>\ndetermined 10-year-old.a little too competitive.&quot; He is obsessed with<br/>\ncatching all Pokemon and driven &quot;to become the world&#39;s foremost Pokemon<br/>\nMaster.&quot; Oh yes, you can be sure that the Pokemon Rap song and mantra<br/>\nwill be included in the materials --  &quot;I will travel across the land   <br/>\nSearching far and wide   Each Pokemon to understand the power that&#39;s<br/>\ninside.          Gotta catch them all!&quot;      The last line<br/>\nof the Pokemon mantra, &quot;Gotta catch them all!&quot; is used over and over<br/>\nagain<br/>\nin Pokemon paraphernalia because it fuels the craving for more cards,<br/>\ngames, toys, gadgets, and comic books.  Let&#39;s look at another character,<br/>\nAsh&#39;s companion Misty. She is described  as &quot;headstrong and stubborn.<br/>\nconstantly quibbling with Ash and seems to  harbor deeper feelings for<br/>\nAsh.&quot; Then there is the third member of the  trio, Brock who is &quot;by far<br/>\nthe most hormonal. Brock&#39;s fascination with the opposite sex many times<br/>\ngets him or the group into trouble, although he&#39;s yet to have anything<br/>\nresembling a score.&quot; Let&#39;s take  a look at Pokemon trainer Gary. He is<br/>\n&quot;a real jerk, self-centered,  vindictive and obnoxious. Then there are<br/>\nJessie & James. Here is how they are described:   -- &quot;Prepare for<br/>\ntrouble, make it double.... Jessie, James are a  mysterious and evil<br/>\ngang looking to steal rare Pokemon. Jessie and  James are stuck up,<br/>\nfashion conscious, and prone to cross-dressing.&quot; Headstrong, stubborn,<br/>\nquibbling, self-centered, vindictive, obnoxious, hormonal, sexually<br/>\npreoccupied, evil, thieving, cross-dressing jerks  are most definitely<br/>\nnot biblical role models! These characters do not portray biblical<br/>\nvalues. Pokemon does not measure up!<br/>\n<br/>\n Are supernatural powers portrayed, and if so, what is the source or<br/>\norigin of those powers? Are occult, New Age characteristics or symbols<br/>\nincluded?<br/>\n<br/>\n Pokemon has supernatural powers. &quot;Some Pokemon grow, or evolve.&quot;  This<br/>\nis<br/>\nfacilitated by the &quot;Energy cards&quot; that &quot;make your Pokemon bigger  and<br/>\nmore<br/>\npowerful.&quot;  And what is the source of this power? It is the  pantheistic<br/>\npower of the occult, not the supernatural power of God. I have found two<br/>\ncards that make this very clear (there are likely more). They are Abra<br/>\nand<br/>\nKadabra. Yes, these are their actual names. &quot;Abrakadabra&quot;  (or <br/>\nabracadabra) has been a word long associated with occult magic. <br/>\nWebster&#39;s dictionary defines it this way - 1) a word supposed to have <br/>\nmagic powers and hence used in incantations, on amulets, etc. 2) a magic<br/>\nspell or formula. It is no accident that the two PokEmon called  Abra<br/>\nand Kadabra are psychic cards with magical powers.<br/>\n<br/>\n On the Abra card we read &quot;Using its ability to read minds, it will<br/>\nidentify impending danger and teleport to safety.&quot; Then there are the<br/>\noccult symbols on Kadabra. He has a pentagram on his forehead, SSS  on<br/>\nhis chest and he is giving the Satanic salute with his left hand. All of<br/>\nthe above have strong occult significance. It is clear from the Bible<br/>\n(Deuteronomy 18:10-12) that we are neither to participate in nor<br/>\nassociate<br/>\nwith activities related to the occult.<br/>\n<br/>\n Some of the readers will no doubt protest, &quot;it&#39;s only a game!&quot; To be<br/>\nsure<br/>\nit is a game, but a game that does not glorify God! When God says<br/>\nsomething is wrong, it is wrong regardless of what form it is in. Not<br/>\nonly that, but many of the kids who play this game are seduced into<br/>\nbelieving the principles that the game subtly teaches. Here is but one<br/>\nexample. In the booklet that comes with PokEmon, note what is <br/>\nstated--   &quot;Welcome to the world of Pokemon, a special place where<br/>\npeople just  like you train to<br/>\nbecome the number-one Pokemon Master in the World!<br/>\n<br/>\n But what is a Pokemon, you ask. &#39; Pokemon are incredible creatures that<br/>\nshare the world with humans,&#39; says Professor Oak, the leading authority<br/>\non<br/>\nthese monsters. There are currently 150 documented species of Pokemon.<br/>\nEach Pokemon has its own special fighting abilities. . . . Some grow, or<br/>\nevolve, into even more powerful creatures.. . . Carry your<br/>\npokemon with you, and you&#39;re ready for anything! You&#39;ve got the power in<br/>\nyour hands, so use it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Listen, kids are carrying around their Pokemon like a magic talisman.<br/>\nAuthor and researcher Berit Kjos tells of a mom who overheard two boys<br/>\ndiscussing their little pocket monsters. As the conversation developed<br/>\none<br/>\nboy said, &quot;I&#39;ll just use my psychic powers.&quot; It was clear that the so<br/>\ncalled fantasy world of Pokemon had already conditioned this boys<br/>\nthinking to be receptive to a key occult doctrine - psychic powers!<br/>\n<br/>\nPokemon promotes occult values, not biblical values and therefore should<br/>\nbe rejected!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere are the player&#39;s thoughts and imagination being directed?<br/>\nI pointed out earlier that Pokemon originated in Japan. What I did not<br/>\ndraw to your attention was that a Pokemon Master is a spin off of a<br/>\nmartial arts master in Japan. Pokemon Masters are the leaders of<br/>\nfighting schools or battling gangs that solve their problems by beating<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nopponents. And how do they do this? Their little booklet says, &quot;Some<br/>\nattacks cause the  Defending Pokemon to be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed,<br/>\nor<br/>\nPoisoned.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible warns us to be cautious about what we occupy our minds with<br/>\n(Proverbs 4:23). The games a child plays, the television programs he<br/>\nwatches, and the things that he listens to have a powerful mind shaping<br/>\ninfluence over that child. Mental health professionals are finally<br/>\ncoming to understand what the Bible has said all along -- the things you<br/>\nlet into you mind shape your thinking and your thinking directs your<br/>\nactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis truth was acted out at the Columbine High school slaughter. The<br/>\nshooters had saturated their minds with violent video games, Gothic<br/>\ndeath<br/>\nmusic, and violent reading material. The result was on April 20, 1999,<br/>\ntwelve students and one teacher were murdered. Could  Pokemon influence<br/>\nthe children who play it? I pray that it does not happen, but I wonder<br/>\nhow long it will be before a grade school child, tries to do what is<br/>\nwritten on the Weepingbell - Razor Leaf Pokemon card. It says, &quot;It spits<br/>\nout poisonpowder to immobilize the enemy, and then finishes the enemy<br/>\nwith a spray of acid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this line up with what the Bible has to say about how to handle our<br/>\nenemies in Romans 12:14-22? I think not! It is clear that Pokemon leads<br/>\nthe player&#39;s imagination down the wrong path.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible says that we are to abhor that which is evil, and cleave to<br/>\nthat<br/>\nwhich is good  Romans 12:9). Poisoning, paralyzing, etc. your enemies is<br/>\nclearly evil and no one should occupy their minds with such thoughts,<br/>\ngame<br/>\nor no game. Our every thought is to be screened to be sure Christ<br/>\napproves<br/>\nof it (2 Corinthians 10:4-5). If it does not line up, it is to be<br/>\nrejected. So, what&#39;s the problem with Pokemon? Its subtle suggestions,<br/>\nimages and values are manipulating the minds and feelings of the<br/>\nchildren who are into it. Pokemon conditions them to accept humanistic<br/>\nwisdom and occult spirituality. Heavy involvement in Pokemon blurs the<br/>\nplayer&#39;s ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality and sears<br/>\nthe conscience of the player as well. Pokemon is designed to be a<br/>\nstepping stone to harder occult oriented games like: Magic, The<br/>\nGathering, and Dungeons and Dragons. God wants his children to have a<br/>\ncompletely different focus. We are even told where our thoughts should<br/>\nbe directed in Philippians 4:8 &quot;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are<br/>\ntrue, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,<br/>\nwhatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever<br/>\nthings are of good  report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any<br/>\npraise, think on these things.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPastor Earl Barnett <br/>\nSoldotna Baptist Church<br/>\n223 E.

The Bible says, &quot;Whatsoever ye do, do all to the<br/>\n&gt; glory of God&quot; 1 Corinthians 10:31. The Bible says, &quot;.Abhor that which is<br/>\n&gt; evil; cleave to that which is good.&quot; Romans 12:9. Therefore, we must<br/>\n&gt; measure Pokemon paraphernalia by the principles of the Bible to<br/>\n&gt; determine if it is acceptable. Let&#39;s do that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  What values, beliefs, and philosophies do the game promote?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  One of the first things I did was to find out who produced the trading<br/>\n&gt; card game. Here is an exact quote right from the Web page of the<br/>\n&gt; producer - &quot;The Pokemon Trading Card Game is a new collectable Card Game<br/>\n&gt; that is made and distributed by Wizards of the Coast. The same company<br/>\n&gt; that made the best selling game ... Magic: The Gathering.&quot; Magic:  The<br/>\n&gt; Gathering is a heavily occult laced trading card game very popular  in<br/>\n&gt; the 1990&#39;s. I have a research report titled Beware of Magic:The<br/>\n&gt; Gathering that can be viewed on the Logos Web page at. <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html\">http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Oh yes, I should mention that Wizards of the Coast also owns TSR, the<br/>\n&gt; producers of all the Dungeons & Dragons materials. When I discovered who<br/>\n&gt; owned the American Pokemon Trading Card Game rights, I knew the game was<br/>\n&gt; not just an innocent card game for elementary school children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Next, I looked into the characters in the Pokemon video games, comics,<br/>\n&gt; cartoons, movies, etc. What kind of values do they have? Ash Ketchum (a<br/>\n&gt; boy) is one of the main characters.. He is described as  &quot;an energetic<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; determined 10-year-old.a little too competitive.&quot; He is obsessed with<br/>\n&gt; catching all Pokemon and driven &quot;to become the world&#39;s foremost Pokemon<br/>\n&gt; Master.&quot; Oh yes, you can be sure that the Pokemon Rap song and mantra<br/>\n&gt; will be included in the materials --  &quot;I will travel across the land   <br/>\n&gt; Searching far and wide   Each Pokemon to understand the power that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; inside.          Gotta catch them all!&quot;      The last line<br/>\n&gt; of the Pokemon mantra, &quot;Gotta catch them all!&quot; is used over and over<br/>\n&gt; again<br/>\n&gt; in Pokemon paraphernalia because it fuels the craving for more cards,<br/>\n&gt; games, toys, gadgets, and comic books.  Let&#39;s look at another character,<br/>\n&gt; Ash&#39;s companion Misty. She is described  as &quot;headstrong and stubborn.<br/>\n&gt; constantly quibbling with Ash and seems to  harbor deeper feelings for<br/>\n&gt; Ash.&quot; Then there is the third member of the  trio, Brock who is &quot;by far<br/>\n&gt; the most hormonal. Brock&#39;s fascination with the opposite sex many times<br/>\n&gt; gets him or the group into trouble, although he&#39;s yet to have anything<br/>\n&gt; resembling a score.&quot; Let&#39;s take  a look at Pokemon trainer Gary. He is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;a real jerk, self-centered,  vindictive and obnoxious. Then there are<br/>\n&gt; Jessie & James. Here is how they are described:   -- &quot;Prepare for<br/>\n&gt; trouble, make it double.... Jessie, James are a  mysterious and evil<br/>\n&gt; gang looking to steal rare Pokemon. Jessie and  James are stuck up,<br/>\n&gt; fashion conscious, and prone to cross-dressing.&quot; Headstrong, stubborn,<br/>\n&gt; quibbling, self-centered, vindictive, obnoxious, hormonal, sexually<br/>\n&gt; preoccupied, evil, thieving, cross-dressing jerks  are most definitely<br/>\n&gt; not biblical role models! These characters do not portray biblical<br/>\n&gt; values. Pokemon does not measure up!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Are supernatural powers portrayed, and if so, what is the source or<br/>\n&gt; origin of those powers? Are occult, New Age characteristics or symbols<br/>\n&gt; included?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Pokemon has supernatural powers. &quot;Some Pokemon grow, or evolve.&quot;  This<br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; facilitated by the &quot;Energy cards&quot; that &quot;make your Pokemon bigger  and<br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; powerful.&quot;  And what is the source of this power? It is the  pantheistic<br/>\n&gt; power of the occult, not the supernatural power of God. I have found two<br/>\n&gt; cards that make this very clear (there are likely more). They are Abra<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; Kadabra. Yes, these are their actual names. &quot;Abrakadabra&quot;  (or <br/>\n&gt; abracadabra) has been a word long associated with occult magic. <br/>\n&gt; Webster&#39;s dictionary defines it this way - 1) a word supposed to have <br/>\n&gt; magic powers and hence used in incantations, on amulets, etc. 2) a magic<br/>\n&gt; spell or formula. It is no accident that the two PokEmon called  Abra<br/>\n&gt; and Kadabra are psychic cards with magical powers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  On the Abra card we read &quot;Using its ability to read minds, it will<br/>\n&gt; identify impending danger and teleport to safety.&quot; Then there are the<br/>\n&gt; occult symbols on Kadabra. He has a pentagram on his forehead, SSS  on<br/>\n&gt; his chest and he is giving the Satanic salute with his left hand. All of<br/>\n&gt; the above have strong occult significance. It is clear from the Bible<br/>\n&gt; (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) that we are neither to participate in nor<br/>\n&gt; associate<br/>\n&gt; with activities related to the occult.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Some of the readers will no doubt protest, &quot;it&#39;s only a game!&quot; To be<br/>\n&gt; sure<br/>\n&gt; it is a game, but a game that does not glorify God! When God says<br/>\n&gt; something is wrong, it is wrong regardless of what form it is in. Not<br/>\n&gt; only that, but many of the kids who play this game are seduced into<br/>\n&gt; believing the principles that the game subtly teaches. Here is but one<br/>\n&gt; example. In the booklet that comes with PokEmon, note what is <br/>\n&gt; stated--   &quot;Welcome to the world of Pokemon, a special place where<br/>\n&gt; people just  like you train to<br/>\n&gt; become the number-one Pokemon Master in the World!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  But what is a Pokemon, you ask. &#39; Pokemon are incredible creatures that<br/>\n&gt; share the world with humans,&#39; says Professor Oak, the leading authority<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; these monsters. There are currently 150 documented species of Pokemon.<br/>\n&gt; Each Pokemon has its own special fighting abilities. . . . Some grow, or<br/>\n&gt; evolve, into even more powerful creatures.. . . Carry your<br/>\n&gt; pokemon with you, and you&#39;re ready for anything! You&#39;ve got the power in<br/>\n&gt; your hands, so use it!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Listen, kids are carrying around their Pokemon like a magic talisman.<br/>\n&gt; Author and researcher Berit Kjos tells of a mom who overheard two boys<br/>\n&gt; discussing their little pocket monsters. As the conversation developed<br/>\n&gt; one<br/>\n&gt; boy said, &quot;I&#39;ll just use my psychic powers.&quot; It was clear that the so<br/>\n&gt; called fantasy world of Pokemon had already conditioned this boys<br/>\n&gt; thinking to be receptive to a key occult doctrine - psychic powers!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pokemon promotes occult values, not biblical values and therefore should<br/>\n&gt; be rejected!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Where are the player&#39;s thoughts and imagination being directed?<br/>\n&gt; I pointed out earlier that Pokemon originated in Japan. What I did not<br/>\n&gt; draw to your attention was that a Pokemon Master is a spin off of a<br/>\n&gt; martial arts master in Japan. Pokemon Masters are the leaders of<br/>\n&gt; fighting schools or battling gangs that solve their problems by beating<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; opponents. And how do they do this? Their little booklet says, &quot;Some<br/>\n&gt; attacks cause the  Defending Pokemon to be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed,<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; Poisoned.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Bible warns us to be cautious about what we occupy our minds with<br/>\n&gt; (Proverbs 4:23). The games a child plays, the television programs he<br/>\n&gt; watches, and the things that he listens to have a powerful mind shaping<br/>\n&gt; influence over that child. Mental health professionals are finally<br/>\n&gt; coming to understand what the Bible has said all along -- the things you<br/>\n&gt; let into you mind shape your thinking and your thinking directs your<br/>\n&gt; actions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This truth was acted out at the Columbine High school slaughter. The<br/>\n&gt; shooters had saturated their minds with violent video games, Gothic<br/>\n&gt; death<br/>\n&gt; music, and violent reading material. The result was on April 20, 1999,<br/>\n&gt; twelve students and one teacher were murdered. Could  Pokemon influence<br/>\n&gt; the children who play it? I pray that it does not happen, but I wonder<br/>\n&gt; how long it will be before a grade school child, tries to do what is<br/>\n&gt; written on the Weepingbell - Razor Leaf Pokemon card. It says, &quot;It spits<br/>\n&gt; out poisonpowder to immobilize the enemy, and then finishes the enemy<br/>\n&gt; with a spray of acid.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does this line up with what the Bible has to say about how to handle our<br/>\n&gt; enemies in Romans 12:14-22? I think not! It is clear that Pokemon leads<br/>\n&gt; the player&#39;s imagination down the wrong path.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Bible says that we are to abhor that which is evil, and cleave to<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; which is good  Romans 12:9). Poisoning, paralyzing, etc. your enemies is<br/>\n&gt; clearly evil and no one should occupy their minds with such thoughts,<br/>\n&gt; game<br/>\n&gt; or no game. Our every thought is to be screened to be sure Christ<br/>\n&gt; approves<br/>\n&gt; of it (2 Corinthians 10:4-5). If it does not line up, it is to be<br/>\n&gt; rejected. So, what&#39;s the problem with Pokemon? Its subtle suggestions,<br/>\n&gt; images and values are manipulating the minds and feelings of the<br/>\n&gt; children who are into it. Pokemon conditions them to accept humanistic<br/>\n&gt; wisdom and occult spirituality. Heavy involvement in Pokemon blurs the<br/>\n&gt; player&#39;s ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality and sears<br/>\n&gt; the conscience of the player as well. Pokemon is designed to be a<br/>\n&gt; stepping stone to harder occult oriented games like: Magic, The<br/>\n&gt; Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons. God wants his children to have a<br/>\n&gt; completely different focus. We are even told where our thoughts should<br/>\n&gt; be directed in Philippians 4:8 &quot;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are<br/>\n&gt; true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,<br/>\n&gt; whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever<br/>\n&gt; things are of good  report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any<br/>\n&gt; praise, think on these things.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pastor Earl Barnett <br/>\n&gt; Soldotna Baptist Church<br/>\n&gt; 223 E.
