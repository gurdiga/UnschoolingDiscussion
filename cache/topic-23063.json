I know this because I had to retake my test after 11 yrs of driveing, due to a suspended lisence, which was a joke too, and I failed!! I failed the stupid test...I did fine on all of the things that are relevant to driving, it was the drug and alchohle laws and &quot;minor&#39; laws(under 21)  I am was over 21 and I had no idea what the maximum fine was if you are am inor cought with alchohl while driving..While this is important, it is also real!<br/>\nly anal...So I failed the thing and they gave me a book, and inside were all of the answers!<br/>\nSon&#39;t know if any of this helped,<br/>\n<br/>\nchavvajo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura90713@...\">laura90713@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Thanks for the info.
