Though &quot;mindfulness&quot; is used as a term in western Buddhism,  <br/>\nthe word they chose when they were translating from Japanese,  <br/>\nChinese, Hindu, Vietnamese and whatever all hodgepodge of ideas were  <br/>\neventually described in English, &quot;mindfulness,&quot; is an English word  <br/>\nover 800 years old. It&#39;s a simple English compound, and has to do  <br/>\nwith the state of one&#39;s mind while performing an action.  It creates  <br/>\na state of &quot;if/then&quot; in one.  And IF a parent intends to be a good  <br/>\nunschooling parent, a generous freedom-nurturing parent, a parent  <br/>\nproviding a peaceful nest, a parent wanting to be her child&#39;s  <br/>\npartner, then the best way she can live in that goal and come ever  <br/>\ncloser to her ideals is to make all her decisions in that light.  The  <br/>\nmore mindful she is of where she intends to go, the easier her  <br/>\ndecisions are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you come to an intersection, how do you decide which way to go?   <br/>\nIt helps, before operating a motor vehicle with all its attendant  <br/>\nexpenses and inherent dangers, to know where you want to go.  When  <br/>\nyou DO have a destination, then each intersection has some wrong  <br/>\nways, and some better and worse ways.    It&#39;s the same with  <br/>\nunschooling.  If that&#39;s where you&#39;re headed, there are some wrong  <br/>\nways you can avoid simply by being mindful of your intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was working on a webpage, as I do, and cleaning up some links,  <br/>\nand came to this article by Danielle Conger, one of the owners of the  <br/>\nAlwaysUnschooled list.   Every paragraph is powerful.  If you have  <br/>\nsomeone to read it aloud to, that might bring it to life even better  <br/>\nthan just running eyes over it.  The writing is big, and it  <br/>\nillustrates the concept wonderfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n From here to the end is the writing of Danielle Conger:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful Mothering: The Art of Being Present<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMothers today juggle so many activities, appointments and duties that  <br/>\nthey may more closely resemble carnival entertainers than icons of  <br/>\nlove and calm. Of course, being an icon is over-rated, but we could  <br/>\nall probably benefit from the ability to slow down some, become more  <br/>\nfocused and find a greater sense of calm and well-being.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness�borrowed from the Buddhist practice of being present and  <br/>\naware of one�s thoughts, actions and environment�can add a powerful  <br/>\ntool to our mothering repertoire, allowing us to take better care of  <br/>\nourselves and those around us.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach moment we spend playing with and caring for our children while  <br/>\nthinking of what to make for dinner, the bills we need to pay, how  <br/>\nmany more minutes until we have to run out the door, the groceries we  <br/>\nneed to buy or anything other than exactly what we are doing with our  <br/>\nchild is a moment with them lost. Truth is, life with our children  <br/>\ngoes by all too fast. For many mothers, it seems like the time  <br/>\nbetween birth and the first day of school goes by in the blink of an  <br/>\neye.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore and more, mothers are choosing to slow down, reject the cultural  <br/>\nvalues of multi-tasking and maximum efficiency, placing value instead  <br/>\nin natural living and attachment parenting and homeschooling. Going  <br/>\nback to the Earth and Mothering centers our Selves, revealing meaning  <br/>\nand value that nourishes instead of fractures. Motherhood offers us  <br/>\nthe chance to rebirth ourselves through the birth of our children.  <br/>\nMindful mothering becomes the spiritual practice of our daily lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMiniature Zen masters, our children offer us valuable insight into  <br/>\nliving with present awareness as well as the opportunity to practice  <br/>\non a daily basis. A smile, a laugh, the sense of wonder at each new  <br/>\nexperience call us back to the moment, back to ourselves, begging us  <br/>\nto see the world through our child�s eyes, to re-experience and re- <br/>\nawaken to the world around us.<br/>\n<br/>\nA squeal of delight as our child experiences the movement of a  <br/>\n�kitty� invites us to look more closely at the cat, to see the  <br/>\ntexture and color of the fur, the suppleness of movement, the  <br/>\nflexibility and focus the cat commands. We see with the wonder of our  <br/>\ntoddler�s eyes and the world is new. Our children generously lend us  <br/>\ntheir perspective from moment to moment, renewing for us the miracle  <br/>\nof living, if we only accept their gift as graciously as it is given.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does it mean to accept this gift? How do we live each moment  <br/>\nmore fully? We can begin by unlearning many of the lessons our fast- <br/>\npaced society tries to teach. We can begin by slowing down, breathing  <br/>\ndeeply, focusing on the task at hand, and we can allow ourselves to  <br/>\nexperience the moment with all of our senses, bringing our body and  <br/>\nmind together as one, united in common experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming More Mindful<br/>\n<br/>\nNursing mothers know the benefits of prolactin, �the mothering  <br/>\nhormone� that�s released during breastfeeding, physiologically  <br/>\nrelaxing us into the moment of nursing�a perfect example of mindful  <br/>\nmothering. Everything stops when we nurse our newborn in the days  <br/>\nbefore it becomes as routine as brushing our teeth. Think back to  <br/>\nthose first weeks of nursing, sitting still, quieting mind and body  <br/>\nas we cradle that new life against our skin, breathing deeply the  <br/>\nsmell of our infant and gazing intently at wondrous, tiny features.  <br/>\nThis is mindfulness. The key is to carry this sense of present  <br/>\nawareness into all our actions and interactions throughout our days,  <br/>\nbut as mothers, we already recognize it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can continue our mindfulness with something as simple as  <br/>\nbreathing. Buddhists have long known that focusing on the breath  <br/>\nunites mind and body, bringing the Whole Self into present awareness.  <br/>\nThich Nhat Hanh, Buddhist monk and 1967 Nobel Peace Prize Nominee,  <br/>\nhas called conscious breathing the crucial bridge between mind and  <br/>\nbody, unifying the two and allowing us to become whole again. He  <br/>\nrecommends using the words, �Breathing in I calm my body; Breathing  <br/>\nout, I smile.� Simply taking a moment to breathe, to recall our  <br/>\nconscious mind and to relax our mouth into a smile enables us to see  <br/>\nand experience life more clearly, richly and honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs parents of young children, we have countless opportunities  <br/>\nthroughout the day to practice this bridging, using conscious  <br/>\nbreathing to recall ourselves to mindfulness in stressful moments.  <br/>\nMore than the classic adage �count to three,� the practice of  <br/>\nconscious breathing taps into our deepest awareness, refocusing our  <br/>\nenergy from reaction to recentering. Moving past reaction by  <br/>\nbreathing deeply, embracing our emotion and owning it, we can avoid  <br/>\nhorn-locking our energy with our child�s and focus instead on  <br/>\ncompassion and empathy, parenting our child through intense emotion  <br/>\nrather than supplanting it with our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can continue with small moments, like giving a child a bath.  <br/>\nRather than sitting by the tub with countless obligations running  <br/>\nthrough our mind, there in order to keep our child safe but not  <br/>\nreally there, we can join the experience, become really present.<br/>\n<br/>\nClimb into the tub, or roll up sleeves to feel the warmth of the  <br/>\nwater. Naturally scented bubble bath can augment the sensory  <br/>\nexperience, pulling us back into the moment with the foamy lightness  <br/>\nof the bubbles, the soothing scent of lavender or chamomile, relaxing  <br/>\nbody and mind into the moment. We can compress a thick sponge,  <br/>\nrelease, feel it drinking in water, becoming heavy, then squeeze,  <br/>\ninviting warm water to rain down our child�s back. Being present and  <br/>\naware creates a moment of connection between ourselves and our child  <br/>\nas together we live that moment fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can continue by truly listening to our children and viewing the  <br/>\nworld through their eyes. By allowing our child�s voice to be our  <br/>\nclarion call back to the present, we can focus all our being on her  <br/>\nwonder, curiosity and need to explore her world. We can look into her  <br/>\neyes as she tells us about the discovery she�s just made, rub her  <br/>\nback as she describes the hurt she feels, get down to her height as  <br/>\nshe explains her needs and plans, shifting our perspective to meet  <br/>\nhers as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy making physical, emotional and spiritual connection with our  <br/>\nchildren, we assure them that they matter in our lives, that they are  <br/>\nmore important than the book we�re reading or the phone call we need  <br/>\nto make or the laundry list of things we need to get done. These  <br/>\nconnections, as they occur, make up the ongoing symbiosis of nurture  <br/>\nand wonder between mother and child, weaving us together at countless  <br/>\npoints throughout the day, wrapping us both in the warmth, love and  <br/>\nsafety of togetherness in each moment, really breathing, really  <br/>\nloving, really living.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Benefits of Mindfulness<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving more mindfully brings us closer to our child�s perspective,  <br/>\nallowing us to glimpse the world through his eyes, but more  <br/>\nimportantly, providing us insight into our child�s Self. Because we  <br/>\nare able to view things more readily from our child�s perspective, we  <br/>\nbecome an important ally, a trusted advisor and a partner in problem  <br/>\nsolving.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough the empathy gained by mothering mindfully, we can aid our  <br/>\nchildren in fulfilling their dreams and desires in safe, productive  <br/>\nand healthy ways. Because they trust that we understand them and can  <br/>\nsee the world from their perspective, they are more willing to turn  <br/>\nto us for help, fostering the openness and communication essential to  <br/>\na positive parent/ child relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindfulness also offers us a shift in our own perspective, enabling  <br/>\nus to see life for what it really is�each moment a miracle. By living  <br/>\nlife moment to moment, we leave the regrets of the past behind us and  <br/>\nthe worries of the future for the day they may come to be. Moreover,  <br/>\nwe begin to see that each moment offers us a fresh opportunity to see  <br/>\nwhat we have right now and enjoy it while it graces our life.  <br/>\nMindfulness centers us in the moment we are alive�breathing, living� <br/>\nfreeing us to see the joy that surrounds us in our child�s smile, the  <br/>\nlight catching the leaves in summer, snow crystals glinting in the  <br/>\ncrisp winter sun. We learn to see the joy that�s all around us.<br/>\n<br/>\nPracticing mindfulness is an excellent way to counter the fear-based  <br/>\nculture in which we live, providing an antidote to each primetime  <br/>\nnewscast sensationally reporting yet another threat to ourselves and  <br/>\nour children. Fear demands that we dwell in what-ifs and a false  <br/>\nfuture, sacrificing the joy of the moment for the fear of someday. As  <br/>\nwe work to live in the moment, we recognize more deeply the worries  <br/>\nand emotions that wrestle us out of the moment, seeing them for the  <br/>\nchimeras they so often are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond the clarity that mindfulness brings to our perception of the  <br/>\nworld, it simultaneously offers clarity of Self. Fostering  <br/>\nintrospection and greater self-awareness, mindfulness can give us a  <br/>\ndeeper understanding of who we are and our place in this world. When  <br/>\nwe hold our mind in focus, we begin to prioritize our life by placing  <br/>\nthe people and the principles that are most important to us foremost  <br/>\nwhere they truly belong. Too easily do we lose sight of the value our  <br/>\nchildren bring to our lives, wishing away the moments of finding  <br/>\nshoes and buckling car seats. Mindfulness brings that value back into  <br/>\nfocus, reminding us to treasure each moment we are blessed with them,  <br/>\nhowever mundane, because it is a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we can hold the truth of that gift in our minds, we can find a  <br/>\ngreater sense of peace within ourselves that allows us to respond  <br/>\nwith a greater sense of peace and gentleness to our children. How  <br/>\nmany times have we woken in the middle of the night to gaze upon our  <br/>\nsleeping children, assuring ourselves that they are still breathing,  <br/>\nwhether they are next to us or in the next room, two or ten? How many  <br/>\ntimes has the mother who lost a child wished for every moment back  <br/>\nagain? If we can hold that sense of mindfulness of life�s precious  <br/>\nvalue, we hold the key to responding to our children with love and  <br/>\nkindness instead of sharpness and exasperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can easily recall ourselves to this sense of mindfulness by  <br/>\npracticing conscious breathing, recalling our priorities and clearing  <br/>\nour perspective from the baggage we bring. When we can stop, focus on  <br/>\nour breathing and re-center, we see the spilt milk for what it truly  <br/>\nis: our child�s attempt to explore his world, to become more  <br/>\nindependent, to perform an act of thoughtfulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur practice becomes our child�s practice as well, as we model for  <br/>\nthem peaceful and empathetic response. By modeling conscious  <br/>\nbreathing before reacting, we show our children how to deal  <br/>\neffectively with intense emotions without ever giving a lesson. Young  <br/>\nchildren, too, can benefit tremendously from learning to breathe  <br/>\nthrough their anger, frustration and disappointment. In my family, we  <br/>\ncall it �blowing bubbles��breathing in good energy and blowing out  <br/>\nnegative energy in tiny bubbles that float safely skyward, popping  <br/>\nwithout harm to ourselves or others. Such deep breathing and  <br/>\nvisualization techniques give children positive and practical tools  <br/>\nthat stay with them through life.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the greatest benefit of mindful mothering is the joyful and  <br/>\ncompassionate home it creates. The ripples of our own mindfulness  <br/>\nemanate, touching all members of the family. Our own empathetic and  <br/>\ncompassionate responses are rejoined by compassion from our spouse  <br/>\nand our children. When we maintain perspective and clarity, we bring  <br/>\nothers back to mindful living with us, reminding them of their own  <br/>\npriorities and the joy that surrounds them. When we feel peace, we  <br/>\nbecome peace and embody the grace of that serenity, embracing our  <br/>\nchildren with a heart of compassion and joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n� Danielle E.
