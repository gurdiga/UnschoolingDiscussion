The first time, we<br/>\ngot netting and hung over the opening they were using to get in.  As the<br/>\nbats come out of the opening they are using as a door, they drop down and<br/>\nstart flying.  But when they come back in the morning, they can&#39;t get under<br/>\nthe netting to get back inside.  After a few days, they had found somewhere<br/>\nelse to live, and we sprayed foam insulation  into the hole they had been<br/>\nusing.   If they have babies, though, they will, of course, come up with<br/>\nanother way to get in to them.<br/>\n    The next time they moved into the attic, they used an opening that we<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get the netting to hang over correctly.  So we went into the attic<br/>\nand set off bug bombs.   I had read they just don&#39;t like the smell, but the<br/>\npoison can&#39;t be good for them either!  This isn&#39;t really an option for you,<br/>\nI guess, since your ceiling height is so high.  Besides, the bug spray would<br/>\nalso drive you out of the house!   A friend of ours used wasp spray, but he<br/>\nwas spraying it into a hole he drilled into a wall.  Maybe spraying just the<br/>\nopening they are using with wasp spray would work.  I guess I am assuming<br/>\nyou know how they are getting in, aren&#39;t I?<br/>\n    Dh and I had a bat in our bedroom once that started flying around when<br/>\nwe turned off the light.  We could hear it, of course, but didn&#39;t know what<br/>\nit was--just that something was alive and moving!  We turned on the light,<br/>\nbut couldn&#39;t get out of bed because every time we sat up, the bat swooped<br/>\nback down as it cirlced the room, and we&#39;d fall back to avoid it.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember how we finally got out of bed to catch it, but we still laugh about<br/>\nbeing stuck in bed for a few minutes, trying to figure it out!<br/>\n    Good luck!
