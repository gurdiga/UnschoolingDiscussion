Through annual memberships, HSLDA<br/>\ncurrently has nearly 70,000 member families united in service together,<br/>\nproviding a strong voice when and where needed. Each year, thousands of<br/>\nmember families receive legal consultation by letter and phone, hundreds<br/>\nmore are represented through negotiations with local officials, and dozens<br/>\nare represented in court proceedings. The National Center for Home<br/>\nEducation, foua division of HSLDA, networks state-wide organizations in<br/>\nall 50 states for rapid response to federal issues, monitors and lobbies<br/>\nfor pro-home school and parental rights bills and serves as a clearing<br/>\nhouse of major home school research.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver since the home school Amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1998<br/>\n(which was drafted by HSLDA&#39;s Senior Counsel, Chris Klicka) was passed by<br/>\nCongress, the rules and guidelines for colleges have changed. However,<br/>\nthese new changes have taken time to reach most colleges, and many are<br/>\nstill unaware of the new law and its impact. For this reason, Chris Klicka<br/>\nof HSLDA has drafted a memo outlining these changes for the benefit of all<br/>\ncollege admission and financial aid officers. You can read a copy of this<br/>\nmemo by visiting our website at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org/docs/000001/00000147.ASP.\">http://www.hslda.org/docs/000001/00000147.ASP.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, HSLDA has just release the results of an informal survey of 971<br/>\ncolleges conducted last year. The purpose of this study was (1) to<br/>\nestablish what colleges and universities currently require of home school<br/>\napplicants, (2) to compare those requirements to HSLDA&#39;s Recommended<br/>\nCollege Admission Policies, and (3) to encourage colleges and universities<br/>\nto loosen unnecessarily restrictive home school admission requirements and<br/>\nadopt the HSLDA&#39;s Recommended College Admission Policies.

HSLDA is open to extending the survey and continuing to<br/>\nupdate the results for those colleges who were not able to participate in<br/>\nthe original survey or whose policies have changed since then.
