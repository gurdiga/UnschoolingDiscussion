The inspector came out and ***OH <br/>\nMY GOODNESS!!!***  the paint had some CRACKS in it and a <br/>\ncouple of spots were actually beginning to flake!!   We got a notice <br/>\nfrom the city that we couldnt&#39; have doors and fascia on our house.   <br/>\n:-D    (Idiots only typed half of the complaint.)
