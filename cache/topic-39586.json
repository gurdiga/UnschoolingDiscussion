ID rather call it GUIDING PIANO!!!!!! i started when <br/>\ni was 11 becasue i had such a neat teacher he suggested i teach the <br/>\nneighborhood kids and it turned into my career~!  but i really find that my <br/>\nbiggest job is providing them and introducing them to all kinds of <br/>\nmusic.......after &quot;teaching&quot; them the keys on the piano (actually.....1 or 2 <br/>\nand then they see they are in order) and then a few notes.....on the 1st page <br/>\nand MAGIC HAPPENS USUALLY!!!!!!!! so for the next year -20 years!!! i find <br/>\nthem music and play for them and with them , do computer games and homemade <br/>\ngames and listen to their stories.....and share life! so what i would do~ is <br/>\nwhat i do~ if she is reluctant....just say we are going to meet a piano <br/>\nteacher........this is just a meeting and then you can decide. OR sign up for <br/>\n5 lessons afte r you all  meet the  teacher  and ask your child to just try 5 <br/>\nfor you. then they can decide if they want to continue. if the child finds it <br/>\nfun and wants to continue....that is still their choice and i think that <br/>\nunschooling is about choices!!!!!~Denise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39566,"nextTopicId":39588}}
