I&#39;m sure she could answer some of your questions or <br/>\nlook for stuff like this when she&#39;s out and about.<br/>\nWe had an &quot;Ana Maimie&quot; (Grandma Maimie) that was a little Eskimo lady in our <br/>\nchurch who was raised in the traditional ways.<br/>\nI have the mukluks she gave me as a child still. In her adult life she hunted <br/>\nfrom an airplane with her dh, he flew the plane and she was the shooter. Very <br/>\ninteresting life.<br/>\nShe died a few years ago, but I have her life story somewhere (which includes <br/>\nher Christian conversion to the church that I left some time ago) if I can <br/>\nfind it I&#39;d be happy to copy any interesting parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>\n                                                        ~Arnold Lobel<br/>\nUnschooling support at pensacolaunschoolers.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51617,"nextTopicId":52014}}
