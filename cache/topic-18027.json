It&#39;s possible <br/>\n&gt; that the dye and bacteria aren&#39;t as bad as the<br/>\n&gt; shaming and pressure.   Do you <br/>\n&gt; re-use toothbrushes or get a new one every day?  (Or<br/>\n&gt; boil them?)  People do <br/>\n&gt; &quot;recycle&quot; their own bacteria pretty often, from<br/>\n&gt; drinking glasses, coffeecups, <br/>\n&gt; all kinds of things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When she&#39;s down or agitated or depressed, the fact<br/>\n&gt; that you DO know it&#39;s the <br/>\n&gt; low of a cycle and she&#39;ll come back up in a few days<br/>\n&gt; or weeks should make it <br/>\n&gt; easy for you to accept that she just kinda might<br/>\n&gt; need to be left alone or at <br/>\n&gt; her own chosen level of interaction.   When she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; active and zippy and <br/>\n&gt; smiley, don&#39;t make a big deal about that<br/>\n&gt; either--just appreciate it, and <br/>\n&gt; maybe encourage her to get some things done (room<br/>\n&gt; cleaning? projects?  having <br/>\n&gt; friends visit?  I&#39;m thinking of examples from other<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s lives) that <br/>\n&gt; might be harder to do when she&#39;s down (temporarily,<br/>\n&gt; next time).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kirby has mood problems more than anyone else in our<br/>\n&gt; family except me.  So <br/>\n&gt; because I was that way as a kid too, I teach him<br/>\n&gt; tricks which nobody thought <br/>\n&gt; to teach me.  How to breathe through frustration and<br/>\n&gt; rising fury, and to <br/>\n&gt; remember that you have to pick up what you throw,<br/>\n&gt; and clean up what you <br/>\n&gt; break.  (When he was younger, he would throw things<br/>\n&gt; down when he was <br/>\n&gt; angry--like remote controls for video games, or<br/>\n&gt; decks of cards.  He quit <br/>\n&gt; doing that before long because we would calmly point<br/>\n&gt; out what his options had <br/>\n&gt; been--to breathe, set them down, and then walk<br/>\n&gt; away.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;ve told Kirby (when he&#39;s receptive) is that<br/>\n&gt; he will probably be that <br/>\n&gt; way his whole life, so he needs to learn to feel it<br/>\n&gt; coming and make <br/>\n&gt; allowances for it.  When he&#39;s in a depressed or<br/>\n&gt; frustrated state, he needs to <br/>\n&gt; arrange to be by himself a little more, and realize<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s HIM and not all <br/>\n&gt; the people and things around him, and that he won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; stay there, that way, for <br/>\n&gt; long.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s lucky to be homeschooled and have the luxury of<br/>\n&gt; not having to interact <br/>\n&gt; with a random bunch of outside people whether he<br/>\n&gt; wants to or not, when he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; in a low phase.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m lucky that I recognized some of his &quot;symptoms&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and could share tricks <br/>\n&gt; with him that help our whole family now, and will<br/>\n&gt; help him always.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Trying to drug a child (except in TOTALLY extreme<br/>\n&gt; cases, which sometimes are <br/>\n&gt; caused by overreaction to mild cases) or change them<br/>\n&gt; or wish the biochemical <br/>\n&gt; realities away will add stress to an already<br/>\n&gt; stressful situation.  Kids don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; act consistently and don&#39;t need to.   Parents can<br/>\n&gt; learn to roll with the <br/>\n&gt; waves, and help the kids do it too.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Bi-polar&quot; or &quot;manic depressive&quot; comes in all<br/>\n&gt; degrees.  I realized in my 20&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; that there were periods of time (not consistent<br/>\n&gt; lengths, but a week or three, <br/>\n&gt; varying) that I could work really late, get up<br/>\n&gt; early, be clear and quick and <br/>\n&gt; work overtime and visit all my friends and read and<br/>\n&gt; remember things (zip, <br/>\n&gt; zip, zip), and then a week or two that I fell asleep<br/>\n&gt; early three or four <br/>\n&gt; nights in a row, couldn&#39;t concentrate well, was<br/>\n&gt; short tempered, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having a consistent schedule every day did *not*<br/>\n&gt; help.  I was restless in the <br/>\n&gt; manic phases (if they can be called that without<br/>\n&gt; people freaking out here) <br/>\n&gt; and too tired in the downtimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s like a larger-scale cycle of sleeping<br/>\n&gt; and wakefulness--it&#39;s like <br/>\n&gt; a cycle of brain growth (especially in kids!!)<br/>\n&gt; followed by a quieter time <br/>\n&gt; (quieter in speed, noise, growth).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is not unnatural.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!

He was put on some anti-depressants (at<br/>\nthe time we didn&#39;t know that the guy who prescribed<br/>\nthem just did so left and right to everyone) and did<br/>\nreally well on them... the problem was that one day<br/>\nwithout them made such a HUGE difference, and one<br/>\nweekend he went the whole weekend without taking them<br/>\n(he was off partying somewhere and his pills were at<br/>\nhome) and when he came back he was going to take them<br/>\nand we all left the house for the day to go do our own<br/>\nthings we had planned, well, when he poured them in<br/>\nhis hand, alot more came out than he needed, and in<br/>\nhis HUGE state of MAJOR depression (worse than usual<br/>\nfrom lack of medication), which impairs your reasoning<br/>\nas well, thought he&#39;d take extra cuz he had missed the<br/>\nwhole weekend. Well, then he got soo depressed in that<br/>\nmoment of realizing he was so dependant on them to be<br/>\nable to function for one day that he took the whole<br/>\nbottle and we all ended up at the hospital praying for<br/>\nhis life. I&#39;m not telling you that to scare you, cuz<br/>\nhe is an extreme case and I&#39;m going to say some<br/>\nopposite ones, but I just said that one first cuz it<br/>\nwas my first introduction to the term of bipolar and<br/>\nmanic-depressive. Medication was obviously not for him<br/>\nand prescribed too hastily. My dad later on came to<br/>\nterms with the fact that he was majorly bipolar, and<br/>\nwe have never been much of a doctor family except when<br/>\nabsolutely neccesary, so the rest of us have never<br/>\nbeen &quot;diagnosed&quot; by a blessed &quot;professional&quot; but that<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t matter to me. Anyway, my dad would<br/>\nstart consciously recognizing when he was having a<br/>\n&quot;low&quot; day and a &quot;high&quot; day. (We could all tell his<br/>\n&quot;high&quot; days since I can remember. He would come home<br/>\nsome days and say &quot;hey you guys wanna go out to eat<br/>\nand stay in a hotel...just for fun?&quot;..this was coming<br/>\nfrom a man who HATED eating out and hotels... and<br/>\nproceed to spend a BUNCH of money on us all without a<br/>\nthought. very compulsively overly happy and<br/>\nenergetic....and the next day you never know he could<br/>\nbe so depressed he just wouldn&#39;t get out of bed. we<br/>\nalways attributed those days, though, to his health<br/>\nproblems (heart, mostly) and assumed he &quot;just didn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel good&quot;) ANYWAY (I frequently drift, bare with me),<br/>\nthat was a good start cuz then he could consciously<br/>\nwork to make it not quite such an extreme case in<br/>\neither direction (but there was still &quot;symptoms&quot; or<br/>\nwhatever you want to call them)...and then came the<br/>\nprozac craze that swept the nation. At the time I was<br/>\na strict vegetarian and radical naturalist and thought<br/>\npills of any kind were bad for you in the long run and<br/>\nthere must be some natural substitute for whatever it<br/>\nwas. Well, my sister&#39;s husband (who we won&#39;t go into<br/>\ncuz I am anti- him) started taking it (he was just<br/>\nflat out depressed, nothing manic about this man ever)<br/>\nand so she suggested it to my dad. Well, even her<br/>\nhusband which I don&#39;t like started acting differently.<br/>\nHe&#39;s normally hard to get along with and please and<br/>\ngets mad at people alot, and he stopped all that. I<br/>\nwas happy for her, but really didn&#39;t care. But then MY<br/>\nDAD was just on a normal even keel all the time. No<br/>\nmanic binges and no making you physically sick<br/>\ndepression that no one can help with. Just ...as close<br/>\nto &quot;normal&quot; (aside from being part of our family, ha<br/>\nha) as possible. We all loved it and he seemed to,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nThen sister&#39;s husband stopped taking it. I think it<br/>\nmade him mad that it forced him to be nice to people. <br/>\nAfter awhile my dad did, too, cuz he said it made him<br/>\ntoo &quot;docile&quot;. We were like, &quot;yeah. for you. it&#39;s a<br/>\ngood thing.&quot; (joking....sorry this is what we do in my<br/>\nfamily. joking helps everything)<br/>\nmy other brother I used to think had this bipolar<br/>\nthing, but I&#39;ve come to the realization recently that<br/>\nthat&#39;s not it at all but something much different and<br/>\ndeeper. My mom&#39;s not had a trace of it at all that I<br/>\ncould ever tell. Me and two of my sisters could be<br/>\nposter girls for the bipolar association if there is<br/>\nsuch a thing. Especially me and my younger sis. I&#39;ll<br/>\ntell you from my own experience, that I have ALWAYS<br/>\nfelt this way, since I was little. I used to cry when<br/>\nmy dad sang &quot;you are my sunshine&quot; and actually MADE<br/>\nhim never sing it anymore cuz I couldn&#39;t handle it cuz<br/>\nit was &quot;just too depressing&quot;. Don&#39;t ask me how I knew<br/>\nwhat depressing was, but I remember thinking all the<br/>\ntime that things were depressing and really knowing<br/>\nwhat I meant by that. There have been brief times in<br/>\nmy adult life that I am at the very bottom of a very<br/>\ndepressing day and when you are there you really see<br/>\nknow way out and you act like a different person and<br/>\nyour friends and family wonder if you are on drugs and<br/>\nyou can hear yourself being a b*tch to them and you<br/>\nfeel bad but you don&#39;t have it in you to act<br/>\ndifferently that day. or that hour, rather. And at a<br/>\ncouple of those times I have thought, I wish I would<br/>\njust have some medication to make this go away and<br/>\nI&#39;ll be normal. But those moments are fleeting and me<br/>\nand my boyfriend have discussed this many times, cuz<br/>\nhis family (bipolar wise anyway) is the same way and<br/>\nhe is and in their family they are all just so<br/>\ncomfortable and accepting of the condition and the<br/>\nfact that at any given moment one of them could be<br/>\nhaving a &quot;low&quot; or a &quot;high&quot; (though theirs are for a<br/>\nfew dayz at a time, not changing several times in one<br/>\nday sometimes)...and it&#39;s just like if someone had<br/>\ndiabetes or high blood pressure or arthritis...and<br/>\nthey work around it. In our family we all recognize it<br/>\nand accept it but we worry about each other when we<br/>\nsee one of us getting down, cuz of the extreme<br/>\nexperiences we&#39;ve had with the boyz. But I have to<br/>\nEMPHASIZE that their problems (bipolar or<br/>\nmanic-depressive or whatever) are only soooo extreme<br/>\ncuz of their alcohol and drug use and I would NOT<br/>\nanticipate that for your daughter...she sounds like my<br/>\nlittle sister who to this very day is the moodiest,<br/>\nmost dramatic and sensitive person I know. Regardless<br/>\nof any bipolar disorder. It&#39;s her personality. And<br/>\nshe&#39;s VERY defensive of people saying she&#39;s too<br/>\ndramatic or sensitive. But she has been working on it<br/>\nalot. She would be that dramatic and moody and upset<br/>\nover things like that when she was younger, JUST like<br/>\nyour daughter. She sucked her thumb til she was like<br/>\n11, and the only harm it did her (besides my<br/>\ntormenting her) was that she sucked sooo hard it<br/>\npulled her teeth out a bit for a slight overbite but a<br/>\nsmall price to pay, I say, for the comfort it brought<br/>\nher (and she had great relationship with both our<br/>\nparents and felt very loved by them, still does), and<br/>\nwhen she sucked her thumb she had to have her favorite<br/>\nblue blanket with &quot;soft&quot; on the edge (or any blanket<br/>\nwith &quot;soft&quot;, if the blue one wasn&#39;t available) and she<br/>\nran the &quot;soft&quot; in and out of her fingers while she<br/>\nsucked her thumb and watched tv or whatever she was<br/>\ndoing...especially going to sleep. She just recently<br/>\nhad to get rid of the blue blanket (I think we buried<br/>\na dog with it or something) and she has now a little<br/>\nyellow baby blanket that she found at a second hand<br/>\nstore and it was JUST like her old one, only smaller<br/>\n(the blue one was a king size or something) ...the new<br/>\nones they make don&#39;t have REAL &quot;soft&quot; on them...just<br/>\nsome scratchy stuff...and she takes the new yellow one<br/>\nwith her when she travels or sleeps somewhere<br/>\nelse...when we go to the movies with my kids I wrap<br/>\nthe kids in it and she hangs on to the corner of<br/>\nit...I think it&#39;s perfectly healthy...she&#39;s 21, by the<br/>\nway. And she has never been on any medication and I<br/>\nthink the only damage that has ever been done to any<br/>\nof us from this is feeling like there is something<br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; with us that&#39;s embarrassing in some way and<br/>\nnot just adapting our lives on a purely day to day<br/>\nbasis according to how everyone is feeling. <br/>\nOh my ex husband had the same problems and ADHD if you<br/>\nbelieve in such a condition. (I do) and I&#39;m sure my<br/>\nkids have a bit of the signs now and will continue to.<br/>\nI try to just act like it&#39;s normal to feel that way<br/>\nand unless they are hurting someone else then I&#39;ll<br/>\ntreat it the same way as if they were anemic. I&#39;m not<br/>\nsaying that&#39;s for everyone though, cuz like I said I<br/>\nthink medication was the right thing for my dad. And<br/>\nlots of other people to. But it is overrated and<br/>\noverdone and sometimes not prescribed properly. My<br/>\nadvice? hm. Am I even qualified to give any? :)<br/>\nI&#39;d say try reading alot about child psychology and<br/>\nnot just bipolar things and try to find the best way<br/>\nfor your family for you to talk to her about it...<br/>\njust ask her how she feels. How she feels sometimes<br/>\nwhen she&#39;s sad, or mad. (But do it when she&#39;s haveing<br/>\na &quot;good&quot; day, maybe? I don&#39;t know) She&#39;ll most likely<br/>\nbe embarrassed by this though. I was anyway. Talking<br/>\nabout any feelings with my parents at that age...<br/>\nbut it might help if you tell her YOU feel sad or mad<br/>\nsometimes just for the heck of it. And that&#39;s totally<br/>\nok. Tell her you aren&#39;t mad at her or hurt by what she<br/>\nsaid about BB, and maybe tell her about something you<br/>\nwere/are attached to from childhood. If she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to talk about it, my honest advice is to not try<br/>\nto make her talk if she REALLY doesn&#39;t want to, but<br/>\nDON&#39;T act as though there is something to be hidden,<br/>\nor NOT talked about and don&#39;t treat her like she is<br/>\nfragile, cuz that may make her feel more on the spot<br/>\nif she just wants to feel like a &quot;normal&quot; kid. Then if<br/>\nit gets worse or maybe if you feel it&#39;s worse right<br/>\nnow, then see about a child counseler for her to see.<br/>\nSounds expensive, but so is medicating and this may<br/>\nhelp in a more long term way.. there are sliding scale<br/>\nplaces too, and ones that target talking to the WHOLE<br/>\nfamily so she doens&#39;t feel singled out and everyone<br/>\nelse can be helped to deal with what&#39;s going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your feelings being hurt. I know mine would<br/>\nbe. I just want my kids to like me and think I&#39;m cool.<br/>\n:) I used to have that going for me, but my boyfriend<br/>\nhas taken my place in the coolness department now and<br/>\nthey love me to death, I know, but I&#39;m not really<br/>\nconsidered &quot;fun&quot; anymore. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll get over it. .....<br/>\nor they&#39;ll be in trouble.<br/>\n(joking again, sorry.)<br/>\nI hope this long long long reply helps a little bit<br/>\nand really bipolar is not that scary, unless it<br/>\nreaches really psychotic levels... I think it is a<br/>\nREALLY good sign that she can calm herself and knows<br/>\nhow to do so without infringing on anyone else. <br/>\nOh yeah, my son chews on EVERYTHING...I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat it is but he goes through these spurts of chewing<br/>\non all his shirts, socks, toys, blankets, his<br/>\nhands...I&#39;ve been meaning to look into some<br/>\npsychological reasons for it.

My sister has gone through a<br/>\nspell where she was manic/depressive (after struggling with anorexia for<br/>\nyears) and I know how hard it can be to deal with this as a family. It was<br/>\nvery difficult while she was living with us at times. The good news is that<br/>\nshe is doing fine now and is not on any medication. So even if your worst<br/>\nfears are realized, remember that it&#39;s not a lifelong sentence, that things,<br/>\npeople, brain chemistry changes. It&#39;s good to look around at all the<br/>\npossibilities and see what could be influencing it. Have you ruled out<br/>\nallergies and sensitivities? Many of them show up as behavioral issues and<br/>\nsome food allergies can directly influence how the brain is functioning<br/>\n(dairy and gluten have both been shown to actually influence brain<br/>\nfunction). My son after he has eaten dairy products is a whole different<br/>\nchild to the one when he has no dairy products. So you might keep a food<br/>\ndiary and a behavioral diary for her and see if there are any obvious<br/>\ntriggers. Also, I&#39;ve mentioned it on this list before, but I would think<br/>\nabout looking into NAET if you suspect allergy-related behavioral issues.<br/>\nYou can read more at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naet.com\">http://www.naet.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>\n&gt; thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>\n&gt; feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>\n&gt; but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>\n&gt; hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>\n&gt; shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>\n&gt; everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>\n&gt; anything else at all about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, first of all these are questions that are unanswerable for her<br/>\nobviously. It would be like someone asking me which of my kids I would<br/>\nrather lose. I still have never gotten over reading &quot;Sophie&#39;s Choice&quot;, ya<br/>\nknow? It&#39;s a question that horrifies any parent because if you love someone<br/>\ncompletely you just can&#39;t contemplate losing them. I suspect the question<br/>\ntook so long for her to answer because she loves both you and her blankie<br/>\ncompletely. As you mentioned you are an attachment parent, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re<br/>\naware of just how important attachment is to the child. But the good news is<br/>\nthat children naturally gain independence from their attachment objects but<br/>\nlove for people is a much more complex and lifelong thing. She may stay very<br/>\nattached to her blankie for a few more years and it may always be something<br/>\nspecial to her, but as she grows and blossoms, her love for you will be<br/>\nsomething much more fulfilling and total than that. If she finds the<br/>\nquestion so distressing, it might be just as well to let her know that you<br/>\nunderstand how hard that question was for her to answer and to let it go at<br/>\nthat (though it might be hard for you).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>\n&gt; is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>\n&gt; me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>\n&gt; pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>\n&gt; mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>\n&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>\n&gt; saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>\n&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>\n&gt; that she really is bipolar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well obviously, I have no idea whether your daughter is or isn&#39;t bipolar,<br/>\nbut I&#39;d say that neither of these things (having a deep need for an<br/>\nattachment object at this age or being unable to speak after saying<br/>\nsomething really frightening) is necessarily unusual. I know lots of people<br/>\nwho kept their blankies or teddy bears well into their teenage or even<br/>\ncollege years, for one thing. As for the rest of her up-and-down behavior,<br/>\nyou might want to talk to a family-friendly counselor or therapist about it.<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest maybe contacting La Leche League to see if they have the name of<br/>\nsomeone who is pro-attachment and can give you a balanced viewpoint on<br/>\nwhether or not you should seek additional help. I&#39;d also investigate the<br/>\nallergy end of it, from my personal experience with that being a big<br/>\ninfluence.<br/>\nI know it is hard to see your child struggle with something that other<br/>\nchildren don&#39;t have to face.

But I&#39;d appreciate any advice<br>&gt; or support from those of you with \n  the kindness and<br>&gt; patience to hear me out.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My dd is \n  8yo. There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br>&gt; bipolar, but we haven&#39;t \n  gotten so far yet as to seek a<br>&gt; diagnosis. Partly that&#39;s because I&#39;m \n  appalled at the<br>&gt; idea of her taking medication. Partly it&#39;s a \n  learned<br>&gt; mistrust of doctors. Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Anyway, today&#39;s incident, which has me in tears off<br>&gt; and on, concerns \n  her blanket. She has had this special<br>&gt; blanket she calls BB since she \n  was, oh, 2 or 3. It&#39;s<br>&gt; very special to her, though it&#39;s nothing more \n  than a<br>&gt; raggedy scrap by now. It has to be washed frequently<br>&gt; \n  because she chews on it. We&#39;ve talked to her about the<br>&gt; dye from the \n  blanket getting into her system (she<br>&gt; sometimes has bright green poop) \n  and about the<br>&gt; bacteria that grow on it from her saliva. She<br>&gt; \n  understands this, but she isn&#39;t able to give up the<br>&gt; chewing. She also \n  still sucks her thumb when trying to<br>&gt; sleep or calm \n  herself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; My ds (10yo) asked her today if she would rather \n  give<br>&gt; up BB or the cat. She looked horrified at the thought<br>&gt; of \n  either choice, then said the cat. Ds and I were<br>&gt; shocked, but I \n  realized it wasn&#39;t a fair question<br>&gt; because of the completely different \n  functions the cat<br>&gt; and the blanket serve for her. That&#39;s like asking \n  me,<br>&gt; would you rather give up books or your friends?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br>&gt; thought and \n  thought and thought for so long I started<br>&gt; feeling insulted. I said, \n  &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br>&gt; know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, \n  Mama,<br>&gt; but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br>&gt; hugged \n  me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br>&gt; shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my \n  personality, it&#39;s my life,<br>&gt; everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or \n  couldn&#39;t) say<br>&gt; anything else at all about it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now \n  before anyone jumps to the conclusion that we<br>&gt; somehow have a troubled \n  relationship (I&#39;d give up my<br>&gt; dad before I&#39;d give up coffee, but then, \n  he&#39;s never<br>&gt; liked me) let me assure you that we are very close,<br>&gt; \n  very open and communicative, very<br>&gt; attachment-parenting. We adore each \n  other. The other<br>&gt; day she woke me with breakfast in bed just because \n  she<br>&gt; wanted to see my pleased surprise.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, I \n  can&#39;t help being hurt. I keep crying. I<br>&gt; tell myself we&#39;ll talk this \n  over tomorrow and it&#39;ll be<br>&gt; fine. Right now, she&#39;s still in her \n  uncommunicative<br>&gt; stage. Dh is out of town for work, and so is my \n  best<br>&gt; friend, and so I don&#39;t even have them to turn to for<br>&gt; \n  perspective.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over \n  this<br>&gt; is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br>&gt; me. \n  In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br>&gt; pacifiers or special \n  teddy bears are a symbol of the<br>&gt; mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so \n  teary is that I&#39;m<br>&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her \n  comfort<br>&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br>&gt; \n  saying something that probably horrified her as much<br>&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m \n  realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br>&gt; that she really is \n  bipolar.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br>&gt; \n  unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br>&gt; example) writing \n  one of her illustrated stories, and<br>&gt; she can&#39;t get her letters to line \n  up perfectly and<br>&gt; goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go \n  to<br>&gt; her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br>&gt; the \n  story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When she was in school \n  (kindergarten and first grade<br>&gt; and the beginning of second) each year, \n  the teachers<br>&gt; started off raving about what a happy, \n  cooperative,<br>&gt; friendly child she was, so well-loved by the \n  other<br>&gt; children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br>&gt; \n  time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br>&gt; wondering if someone \n  had died or if there was a<br>&gt; divorce going on, because Aubrey had \n  suddenly changed<br>&gt; dramatically and was now&nbsp; a sullen, \n  teary,<br>&gt; non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br>&gt; \n  the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br>&gt; was no problem, \n  that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br>&gt; person, and that this new Aubrey \n  was every bit as much<br>&gt; the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of \n  course<br>&gt; they thought I was covering some family secret or<br>&gt; \n  something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br>&gt; approach me and \n  say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br>&gt; maybe whatever the problem was had \n  been solved but<br>&gt; they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her \n  &quot;old<br>&gt; self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br>&gt; \n  maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br>&gt; to the school \n  counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br>&gt; perfectionism, inability to \n  stop a creative project<br>&gt; when it was time to line up (I know, I can see \n  you<br>&gt; rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br>&gt; problems&quot; \n  and so forth. The the school counselor would<br>&gt; feel the sweet thrill of \n  success as Aubrey would<br>&gt; suddenly become sunny and sweet \n  again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess \n  I<br>&gt; just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br>&gt; patience to \n  read it all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Juli, who is tearing up \n  again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \n  __________________________________________________<br>&gt; Do You \n  Yahoo!?<br>&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

The first was that it sounds to <br/>\nme like your daughter&#39;s reaction may be more from feeling like she&#39;s being <br/>\npushed to give up the blanket than how she separates her attachment to <br/>\nothers.  She may be reluctant to admit that it&#39;s not as important as any <br/>\nother loved thing or person for fear it will mean she has to give it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thought is that it&#39;s very hard for children to answer questions <br/>\nlike the one that was asked of her.  I think they know instinctively that <br/>\nit&#39;s a test of their loyalty and love and they freeze up.  Also, kids are <br/>\nvery close to their emotions.  If they aren&#39;t &quot;feeling&quot; particularly <br/>\naffectionate it&#39;s hard to &quot;say&quot; it anyway.

He chews the sleeves of his shirts and <br/>\nsweatshirts, mainly. The left sleeves, usually. They get really, really wet, <br/>\nsometimes to the elbow, and full of holes. He has a precious blankie, that he <br/>\nchews on as well, but I guess the sleeves are more convenient. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse, 8, no longer chews his clothes. (For him it was the neck of his shirts <br/>\n-- all of them had a hole or two at his breastbone.) He chewed for about a <br/>\nyear. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, personality-wise, Owen is sunshine. He is one of the most self-confident <br/>\npeople I have ever met. He sees nothing wrong with chewing on his sleeves. In <br/>\nhis mind, if he&#39;s doing it, he must need or want to for some reason, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s good enough for him. He isn&#39;t sitting in the corner huddled up <br/>\nchewing, he is running, laughing, playing, watching T.V. -- and chewing. <br/>\n<br/>\nJesse is &quot;moody&quot;. (Like me.) He can explode or withdraw with frustration. His <br/>\n&quot;habits&quot; -- continual handwashing, &quot;don&#39;t touch my things -- your hands are <br/>\ndirty!&quot;, intense need to possess and collect things -- could be viewed as <br/>\nodd, I suppose, as could Owen&#39;s chewing. But really, it&#39;s just them -- part <br/>\nof their individual little &quot;uniqueness&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really hate to see them start to wonder if something is &quot;wrong with <br/>\nme&quot;. To me THAT is much more damaging than Owen&#39;s chewing or Jesse&#39;s <br/>\nexplosions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sucked my thumb until I was about 8. Besides the bad tasting stuff they <br/>\nused to put on my thumb to discourage me, my dad&#39;s favorite tactic was to <br/>\nmake fun of me in front of my younger brother and sister. I tell Owen to chew <br/>\non his shirt sleeves as long as he wants to. We have lots of hand-me-downs, <br/>\nand he won&#39;t run out of shirts. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also feel that &quot;bipolar&quot; is the medical communities next &quot;ADD&quot;. Just wait <br/>\nand watch. It will be the next &quot;popular&quot; dx for kids. Look at what you have <br/>\ndone for your kids already, Juli. You are a strong and protective mother and <br/>\nyou can hunt down answers about the bipolar worries. You&#39;ll know in your <br/>\nheart what is true and right and loving for your daughter. There is nothing <br/>\nwrong with her having that blanket. There is nothing wrong with the chewing. <br/>\nAnd she loves you, of course, she just sounds frightened that someone may <br/>\ntake her blanket away and that the people she loves view her having it as <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; somehow. &quot;Is something wrong with me?&quot; is a question that haunts many <br/>\nof us from our childhood, and it breaks my heart when a child starts to <br/>\nwonder this.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a good and strong and loving mother. She is your perfect child. You <br/>\nare so lucky to have each other. Don&#39;t let false worries and fear creep in. <br/>\nBreathe deeply and then start to search for some truth. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally -- I just cringe when I write a post that sounds &quot;all-knowing&quot; and <br/>\nfull of wisdom. (ugh.) This is just our experience and my thoughts. Take what <br/>\nsounds right for you and your situation, and TOSS the rest! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove to you and your family,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"i1BrnWk8Ae3COjO5cFugRsaSsiCoCXoMX2sdTEz9WPw048Ey3mAgRUXAZ0Z3UeigDbPkltiJJiUD1vWmF7Af_5Ct","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Please advise","postDate":"986461678","msgId":18044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBQ0MzNUVFLkIyQzcyMEY3QGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDA1MDM0NzU4LjE3NDAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMjAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18030,"nextInTopic":18046,"prevInTime":18043,"nextInTime":18045,"topicId":18027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Yuli; All I can say is sit tight for now .

Aubrey is not so unique to be<br/>\nparicularly attached to a &quot;lovie&quot; or inanimate object.  I have a sister<br/>\nwho was very much like your Aubrey.  She too was soooooooooooo<br/>\nincredibly attached to her blankie I know it caused my mom unending<br/>\ngrief for a lot of years.<br/>\n(My sister was also a thumb-sucker.)  I don&#39;t want to spook you but<br/>\nwould you believe she never really did out-grow the thing?  Even as a<br/>\nteen she would enjoy the feel of running her fingers through that<br/>\nhardly-there and well-worn scrap of a blankie.  Literally, it was a<br/>\nshred of what it was but she still knew where it was if she needed it. <br/>\nCertainly, her habits with it changed considerably the older she got, to<br/>\nthe point where it was a very occasional quick touch every few weeks,<br/>\nbut I think it was dependable security during an anxious moment.  Sure<br/>\nbeats cigarettes!  As a 38 year old woman now I do believe she STILL<br/>\nknows where those bare threads of a scrap could be found if she needed<br/>\nit!  I&#39;ve seen her suspiciously linger over a wash cloth or two when<br/>\nfolding laundry!!!  (Try not to laugh too hysterically)  I might add she<br/>\nis now a completely content, attractive and successful woman who handles<br/>\nextrememly stressful situations better than most people I know.  She<br/>\nworks at the biggest and busiest law firm in town, with one of Canada&#39;s<br/>\ngreatest corporate lawyers.  So the blankie has not done her any harm. <br/>\nShe did go through a spell of depression during highschool after coming<br/>\ndown with mononucleosis and then again after a sexual assault as an<br/>\nadult but otherwise has been a strong and vibrant woman.  Try not to<br/>\nworry.  The blankie behavior is far more normal than society is willing<br/>\nto recognize.  It is wonderful to hear that you are such a loving and<br/>\n&quot;attached&quot; mother who is so in touch with her daughter.  If she needs<br/>\nyour support in a different way when she is older I know you will be<br/>\nthere for her.  You are right to be concerned about how children can<br/>\noften be over-medicated these days.  Maybe the day will come when she<br/>\ncould benefit from medication but I wouldn&#39;t think that day is here<br/>\nyet.  If you become truly concerned with moodiness and unhappiness as<br/>\ntime goes on perhaps experimenting with the herbal St. John&#39;s Wort could<br/>\nindicate some change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you and Aubrey all the best,<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nyuli womie wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This might be a long one, so I understand some of you<br/>\n&gt; might have to skip it.

There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br/>\n&gt; bipolar, but we haven&#39;t gotten so far yet as to seek a<br/>\n&gt; diagnosis.

Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, today&#39;s incident, which has me in tears off<br/>\n&gt; and on, concerns her blanket. She has had this special<br/>\n&gt; blanket she calls BB since she was, oh, 2 or 3. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; very special to her, though it&#39;s nothing more than a<br/>\n&gt; raggedy scrap by now. It has to be washed frequently<br/>\n&gt; because she chews on it. We&#39;ve talked to her about the<br/>\n&gt; dye from the blanket getting into her system (she<br/>\n&gt; sometimes has bright green poop) and about the<br/>\n&gt; bacteria that grow on it from her saliva. She<br/>\n&gt; understands this, but she isn&#39;t able to give up the<br/>\n&gt; chewing. She also still sucks her thumb when trying to<br/>\n&gt; sleep or calm herself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My ds (10yo) asked her today if she would rather give<br/>\n&gt; up BB or the cat. She looked horrified at the thought<br/>\n&gt; of either choice, then said the cat. Ds and I were<br/>\n&gt; shocked, but I realized it wasn&#39;t a fair question<br/>\n&gt; because of the completely different functions the cat<br/>\n&gt; and the blanket serve for her. That&#39;s like asking me,<br/>\n&gt; would you rather give up books or your friends?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>\n&gt; thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>\n&gt; feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>\n&gt; but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>\n&gt; hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>\n&gt; shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>\n&gt; everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>\n&gt; anything else at all about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now before anyone jumps to the conclusion that we<br/>\n&gt; somehow have a troubled relationship (I&#39;d give up my<br/>\n&gt; dad before I&#39;d give up coffee, but then, he&#39;s never<br/>\n&gt; liked me) let me assure you that we are very close,<br/>\n&gt; very open and communicative, very<br/>\n&gt; attachment-parenting. We adore each other. The other<br/>\n&gt; day she woke me with breakfast in bed just because she<br/>\n&gt; wanted to see my pleased surprise.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, I can&#39;t help being hurt. I keep crying. I<br/>\n&gt; tell myself we&#39;ll talk this over tomorrow and it&#39;ll be<br/>\n&gt; fine. Right now, she&#39;s still in her uncommunicative<br/>\n&gt; stage. Dh is out of town for work, and so is my best<br/>\n&gt; friend, and so I don&#39;t even have them to turn to for<br/>\n&gt; perspective.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>\n&gt; is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>\n&gt; me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>\n&gt; pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>\n&gt; mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>\n&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>\n&gt; saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>\n&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>\n&gt; that she really is bipolar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br/>\n&gt; example) writing one of her illustrated stories, and<br/>\n&gt; she can&#39;t get her letters to line up perfectly and<br/>\n&gt; goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go to<br/>\n&gt; her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br/>\n&gt; the story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When she was in school (kindergarten and first grade<br/>\n&gt; and the beginning of second) each year, the teachers<br/>\n&gt; started off raving about what a happy, cooperative,<br/>\n&gt; friendly child she was, so well-loved by the other<br/>\n&gt; children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br/>\n&gt; time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br/>\n&gt; wondering if someone had died or if there was a<br/>\n&gt; divorce going on, because Aubrey had suddenly changed<br/>\n&gt; dramatically and was now  a sullen, teary,<br/>\n&gt; non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br/>\n&gt; the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br/>\n&gt; was no problem, that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br/>\n&gt; person, and that this new Aubrey was every bit as much<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of course<br/>\n&gt; they thought I was covering some family secret or<br/>\n&gt; something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br/>\n&gt; approach me and say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br/>\n&gt; maybe whatever the problem was had been solved but<br/>\n&gt; they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her &quot;old<br/>\n&gt; self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br/>\n&gt; maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br/>\n&gt; to the school counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br/>\n&gt; perfectionism, inability to stop a creative project<br/>\n&gt; when it was time to line up (I know, I can see you<br/>\n&gt; rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br/>\n&gt; problems&quot; and so forth. The the school counselor would<br/>\n&gt; feel the sweet thrill of success as Aubrey would<br/>\n&gt; suddenly become sunny and sweet again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess I<br/>\n&gt; just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br/>\n&gt; patience to read it all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Juli, who is tearing up again.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get email at your own domain with Yahoo!

I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>\n&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>\n&gt; saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>\n&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>\n&gt; that she really is bipolar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br/>\n&gt; unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br/>\n&gt; example) writing one of her illustrated stories, and<br/>\n&gt; she can&#39;t get her letters to line up perfectly and<br/>\n&gt; goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go to<br/>\n&gt; her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br/>\n&gt; the story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When she was in school (kindergarten and first grade<br/>\n&gt; and the beginning of second) each year, the teachers<br/>\n&gt; started off raving about what a happy, cooperative,<br/>\n&gt; friendly child she was, so well-loved by the other<br/>\n&gt; children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br/>\n&gt; time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br/>\n&gt; wondering if someone had died or if there was a<br/>\n&gt; divorce going on, because Aubrey had suddenly changed<br/>\n&gt; dramatically and was now  a sullen, teary,<br/>\n&gt; non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br/>\n&gt; the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br/>\n&gt; was no problem, that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br/>\n&gt; person, and that this new Aubrey was every bit as much<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of course<br/>\n&gt; they thought I was covering some family secret or<br/>\n&gt; something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br/>\n&gt; approach me and say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br/>\n&gt; maybe whatever the problem was had been solved but<br/>\n&gt; they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her &quot;old<br/>\n&gt; self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br/>\n&gt; maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br/>\n&gt; to the school counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br/>\n&gt; perfectionism, inability to stop a creative project<br/>\n&gt; when it was time to line up (I know, I can see you<br/>\n&gt; rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br/>\n&gt; problems&quot; and so forth. The the school counselor would<br/>\n&gt; feel the sweet thrill of success as Aubrey would<br/>\n&gt; suddenly become sunny and sweet again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess I<br/>\n&gt; just won&#39;t.
