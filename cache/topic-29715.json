Zoe has been writing since she was 3 1/2. She asked me one day to <br/>\nwrite a letter so she could copy it. It never ended. But I have to spell <br/>\neverything for her. She doesn&#39;t read yet. She is 5 1/2. I don&#39;t expect her <br/>\ntoo. She does ask to read w/ me sometimes when I am reading to her. We do <br/>\nthat for a bit and she tires and tells me to finish. I just finish reading to <br/>\nher,no problem. I never coax her or sit her down to read.  W/ math she picks <br/>\nstuff up and asks me to help her. We get a pkg. each month w/ a craft and <br/>\nbook plus  a workbook. I was never thrilled abnout the workbooks and never <br/>\nopened them. She began this on her own and asks me for help. I do it. At the <br/>\nbook store she will choose to buy workbooks over a coloring book. Go figure,I <br/>\nnever would have done that as a child. This is all her not me,I hate <br/>\nworkbooks or anything resembling *schooling. But I go w/ her flow. <br/>\n<br/>\n    So I feel she is doing fine and I have no worries. Others doubt me and <br/>\nare really giving me a hard time. telling me my child will be left behind in <br/>\nthe USA if I don&#39;t sit her down and do her basics w/ her.
