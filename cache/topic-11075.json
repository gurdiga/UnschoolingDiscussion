We got Mathquest with<br/>\n&gt;Aladdin by Disney a couple days ago, and my 7yo boy really seems to enjoy<br/>\n&gt;it. It&#39;s giving him good practice in adding and subtracting and has a lot <br/>\n&gt;of<br/>\n&gt;little logic games. Nice calm music too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Chumbo.com was out of stock on many of the titles that interested me,<br/>\n&gt;though. Several of the titles were by a publisher called Broderbund, but<br/>\n&gt;when I tried to get to their web site, I was directed to Mattel instead. I<br/>\n&gt;suppose there&#39;s been a buyout or something. Even there many of the title<br/>\n&gt;were out of stock.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If anyone has any other good sources for educational CD-roms, I&#39;d be<br/>\n&gt;interested!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Annette<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11065,"nextTopicId":11076}}
