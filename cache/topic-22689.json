I&#39;m not concerned<br/>\nabout penmanship.  When she does choose to write it is<br/>\nvery legible.  I just want reassurance that if I leave<br/>\nher to her own devices she will be able to do it when<br/>\nshe wants to.  Even as I type that it sounds goofy. <br/>\nOf course if she wants to do something she will learn<br/>\nhow.  I do know that.  The truth of the matter is that<br/>\nshe chose to attend a small private school for four<br/>\nweeks last fall.  I came across a &quot;discovery journal&quot;<br/>\nrecently that was required by the school, and I was<br/>\nquite shocked at the inability to write simple<br/>\nsentences or even spell with much success<br/>\nphonetically. I admit part of it is my own ego.  I can<br/>\njust imagine the school teacher&#39;s discussing what a<br/>\nlousy job of homeschooling I&#39;m doing!  So I guess the<br/>\nquestion for parents of older homeschoolers is - am I<br/>\nright or am I wrong that she will at some point<br/>\ndevelop an interest in expressing herself?  And if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t than what?  She is not a child who easily<br/>\naccepts direction so I&#39;m not even sure what to do if I<br/>\nshould be doing something...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone for input.<br/>\nTammy  :)<br/>\n--- SandraDodd@... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;HR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br/>\n&lt;tt&gt;<br/>\nAh...&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nIf by &quot;writing&quot; you mean forming letters<br/>\nwith a pencil, that is penmanship.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nSomeone can have a gorgeous writing hand and never<br/>\n&quot;write&quot; a thing, in the &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nsense that writing is creating new combinations of<br/>\nwords which others can &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nread later.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nPenmanship, being a scribe, being a clerk,<br/>\netc.--that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nthing.&nbsp; An ancient art going back to Egypt and<br/>\nbefore, where one person wrote &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nwhat other people said, or copied books, so there<br/>\ncould be extra copies.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nI think of writing as writing--setting ideas<br/>\ndown.&nbsp; And if that is done with &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\na computer instead of pencil on paper, it is more<br/>\nuseful than not.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nNeither of my boys has penmanship worth a damn, but<br/>\nabout a month after &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\neither of them decides he wants some, I think he will<br/>\nhave it.&nbsp; All it takes &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nis goofing around, copying words, writing the same<br/>\nsets of letters over and &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nover and over.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nI have a couple of calligraphy hands I can do<br/>\nfluently.&nbsp; Neither took much &lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nlearning, just doing.&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\nSandra&lt;BR&gt;<br/>\n&lt;/tt&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2&gt;<br/>\n&lt;tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC&gt;<br/>\n&lt;td align=center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot;<br/>\ncolor=#003399&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yahoo!
