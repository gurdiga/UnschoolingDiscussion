They seem to be separated siblings! Funny is<br/>\nnumber one on her list of what makes anything appealing! I&#39;d forgotten the<br/>\nGarfields. She&#39;s read every single one. (The other comics you mentioned I<br/>\nread to her.) Part of the appeal of funny may be the feedback you get on<br/>\nwhether you read it right.

I sat with them during the appointment and he patiently explained what he was testing and the results.  My kids thought the appointment was fun, and the therapy he suggested for improving my daughter&#39;s perceptual skills was some geoboard puzzle exercises we did at home, for as long as she was interested.  As an aside, sometimes the results are surprising.

(Parents Active?... Vision... E?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think reading lots of comic book type books COULD correlate to a <br/>\ntracking problem as the text in thought balloons doesn&#39;t stretch as <br/>\nwidely across the page as chapter book text.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I chose to read my email and the unschooling.com message <br/>\nboards in a narrow window, so that the text is more like a column of <br/>\ntext in a newspaper.  I find this more comfortable for my eyes.  The <br/>\nfull width of the computer screen is definitely too wide for me to scan. <br/>\n  You could experiment with this.  Also, I think a bookmark run <br/>\nhorizontally under text might help someone with a scanning problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter&#39;s reading development sounds a lot like my son&#39;s.  Two and <br/>\na half years ago my dh was studying for his education credential, and as <br/>\na part of his homework he gave my son a &quot;reading test&quot;.  James read two <br/>\npages aloud out of Redwall.  He read smoothly and with expression and <br/>\nonly stumbled on &quot;dormitory&quot; and one other word.  For a kid who wasn&#39;t <br/>\nreading nearly anything on his own, it was amazing the three and four <br/>\nsyllable words he could pronounce.  (He had a strong spoken vocabulary.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years followed this in which it seemed he read only Garfield books. <br/>\n  OK, he read a lot of Garfield the first year.  The second year he also <br/>\nread Calvin and Hobbes and Asterix and Tintin, but he still read a lot <br/>\nof Garfield and didn&#39;t read &quot;chapter books&quot;.  (Unless you want to <br/>\nstretch the definition and count Capt. Underpants as a chapter book.) <br/>\nThis was just a bit confounding to me, as I thought I had evidence that <br/>\nhe COULD read chapter books, he just didn&#39;t ever read them.  But the <br/>\namount of time he spent reading comic books steadily increased, and he <br/>\nwould fall on the daily newspaper and read the comic pages with glee.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told me a couple of times that his head hurt when he tried to read <br/>\nbooks without pictures, so we did take him in for a conventional eye <br/>\ntest.  The eye doctor, without being a developmental eye specialist, <br/>\nthought James eyes were tracking fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames now sometimes reads a chapter of Harry Potter if I am busy.  This <br/>\nonly started within the last two months.  He has said that he likes <br/>\nlistening to me read and that it is easier for him to form mental <br/>\npictures if he is listening.  I have always thought his learning style <br/>\nwas very auditory, so I guess this makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing going on with James is that he has a strong preference <br/>\nfor books that are funny.  (Which isn&#39;t at all surprising, as our family <br/>\nmotto is &quot;Only when it&#39;s funny.&quot; from the handcuff escape scene in Who <br/>\nFramed Roger Rabbit.)  I think funny books have a bigger &quot;payoff&quot; and <br/>\nthey really reward the effort of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always thought Easy Readers were kind of lame, but maybe I should have <br/>\nhad more of that stuff around as James was easing in to reading.  I just <br/>\nexpected him, based on the &quot;test&quot; my dh had done, to be able to read <br/>\nmore complex stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Stuck with reading","postDate":"1067704138","msgId":83575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCQzk0OTdBLjIwNEI5JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":83577,"prevInTime":83574,"nextInTime":83576,"topicId":83575,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kat, who is 12, wants to read better but I m having a hard time getting out of her what she feels is wrong.

She gets frustrated when she says &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know&quot; about something and I try to draw out more information.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe does have brand new reading glasses now but she isn&#39;t reading more now<br/>\nthan before.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to be able to process. She reads Captain Underpants and emails<br/>\nfrom her friends, which have a high white space to word ratio. She reads New<br/>\nMoon magazine cover to cover, which is relatively dense type, and has<br/>\ndiscussed articles so it sounds like she&#39;s processing well what she&#39;s<br/>\nreading. She reads gaming magazines. She goes through one in maybe half an<br/>\nhour, just picking and choosing the stuff that interests her. But<br/>\noccasionally I&#39;ve noticed what she&#39;s gotten from something isn&#39;t precisely<br/>\nwhat it said. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe apparently read every word in a gaming guide that she had while waiting<br/>\nfor a game to arrive in the mail, but usually she looks for specific<br/>\ninformation. So she&#39;ll skim to find a word, but if there is contradictory or<br/>\npreliminary information before the part she reads, she&#39;ll miss it because<br/>\nit&#39;s more effort than it&#39;s worth to read for information that might not be<br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe read Harry Potter #1 out loud two (or three?) years ago and she read<br/>\nwell, with proper inflection so she was understanding what she read. She<br/>\nstumbled over words here and there but they were irregular words she&#39;d never<br/>\nseen written, and no pattern that suggested she was having problems<br/>\nprocessing or decoding. She said it was hard for her, but the difficulty<br/>\nwasn&#39;t apparent in her reading. Reading out loud *is* harder than reading<br/>\nsilently but this &quot;hard&quot; seems to apply to reading in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to be able to read teeny tiny print better than my old eyes can,<br/>\nbut perhaps not as well as I used to be able to. When she writes page length<br/>\nstuff, her writing is larger than adult-level book type but it seems in<br/>\nproportion to some writing I have when I was her age. And when she writes<br/>\nthe conversation balloons in her comics her printing is pretty small.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has started two adult-level novels that she really wants to read but<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been able to get very far in. She says she &quot;doesn&#39;t like to read&quot;,<br/>\nbut since that doesn&#39;t seem to be true, she seems to be using that phrase to<br/>\nmean something else, like it isn&#39;t as effortless for her as she&#39;d like it to<br/>\nbe. She seems basically to be stuck on the Captain Underpants level of print<br/>\nfor reading for fun for 2 years and hasn&#39;t moved beyond it and she&#39;s<br/>\nfrustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, I thought if I wrote it all out, I might see some clues that point in a<br/>\nvariety of directions but it&#39;s really sounding like vision.

I *think* if that were the case with Kat, with all the<br/>\nplaying around she does with fonts and backgrounds, she would have hit on<br/>\nsomething that she was drawn to. But, unless she&#39;s having fun, she sticks<br/>\nwith relatively small black type on white. But does anyone has information<br/>\nabout that?
