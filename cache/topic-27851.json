I spent years scared to death about peanut<br/>\nbutter when I was a mere tyke back in the dark ages &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at Tilton Park in the Bay Area.  We use to go to ride on the<br/>\ncarousel and my little sister was absolutely addicted to peanut butter.  We<br/>\neach had our little bag with our sandwiches in them.  Mine was tuna, her&#39;s<br/>\nwas peanut butter.  At anyrate, we also had dehydrated fruit in the bags.<br/>\nAnther child was playing by us and my mother asked if the child could have<br/>\nsome of the pears because she had brought a whole extra bag of them.  The<br/>\nwoman asked me what I was eating.  I told her tuna.  My mother had one of<br/>\nthose quizical looks on her face.  The woman said o.k. not knowing that the<br/>\nmy little sister&#39;s sandwich was peanut butter (she was on the carousel with<br/>\nmy dad) and I guess some of the peanut butter got on the pears when my<br/>\nmother made up the bags.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little girl went into anaphalactic shock!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a truely scary world out there for folks with allergies!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Joseph Fuerst &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fuerst@...\">fuerst@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, November 17, 2001 7:36 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1591<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .
