Please reread what was said Bridget. She NEVER<br/>\n  applied it to everyone. That is clear by the phrase &quot;the other&quot; meaning YOUR<br/>\n  children. not everyones.<br/>\n  Elissa<br/>\n  &gt;No, it works for two out of three kids in this household.  I would not<br/>\n  &gt;dream of trying to apply that statistic to the rest of the world.  I<br/>\n  &gt;would only use it to say that it is possibly for it to work and for it to<br/>\n  &gt;not work having experienced both.  What the percentages are for the rest<br/>\n  &gt;of you is beyond my scope of knowledge.<br/>\n  &gt;          Bridget<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; Apparently, according to Bridgets response, it works well for two<br/>\n  &gt;&gt; out of three kids.
