Sort of, you pick the topic and any activites and <br/>\ngo from there.  So if I am understanding correctly, I have to find <br/>\nthat balance between making his interests available but with no <br/>\nbeginning and no end?  So now when I bring home books on knights from <br/>\nthe library do I just leave them out for him to puruse or do I offer <br/>\nthem?  One book has specific projects, do I show him and allow him to <br/>\nchoose if interested or scrap it all together?

I am definitely still caught in the schooling <br/>\nworld myself.  I think I am having a hard time drawing the line <br/>\nbetween exposing him to ideas and the world and lessons.  For <br/>\nexample, with Egypt I offered to let him do heiroglyphics with <br/>\nstampers which I thought he would enjoy because he hates writing.  He <br/>\nended up coloring and drawing on his own for over an hour and he <br/>\nHATES writing.
