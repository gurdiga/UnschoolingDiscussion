I used<br/>\nto ask them to say they are sorry but only if they really were and to tell<br/>\neach other how they feel. If they are younger (2-7 years) you need to<br/>\ndiscuss it with them (Waldorf method doesn&#39;t believe they can or should be<br/>\nreasoned with at this stage but I beg to differ!) IF it is a particularly<br/>\n&quot;naughty&quot; thing the child did ie biting etc. I once or twice had them draw a<br/>\npicture of the mistake they made and show what they would do next time their<br/>\nsib made them angry or jealous whatever! I have some very cute pictures of<br/>\nthem counting to 10 which was their idea to do to blow off steam before<br/>\nreacting. Each problem is different as is each child and their temperament,<br/>\nif it is a minor offense and a child is tattling than I tell them to talk to<br/>\neach other about it and see if they can resolve it without me. Mostly I<br/>\nthink they fight when my dh and I fight or ignore their needs. We are role<br/>\nmodels for this stuff whether we want to be or not. If we are ignoring them<br/>\nwhile online here and they act up that is another message.  (same for being<br/>\nnot he phone or any activity we chose while away from them). I know that if<br/>\nI have spent a lot of quality time with them they are much better behaved<br/>\nthan if I were to spend a lot of time doing household or other things not<br/>\ninvolved with them. Of course we have to have a life of our own and balance<br/>\nand  little ones esp. need to learn how to resolve their conflicts with each<br/>\nother. I worry when my two will not let a 3rd friend play with them you know<br/>\n2 is company  3 is a crowd.

They get along for a few<br/>\nmonths, then just plain don&#39;t for a few months.  I have no idea why that<br/>\nit, but then everything in life seems to run in cycles, doesn&#39;t it.  I<br/>\nthink the best thing we can do for our kids in general is to teach them<br/>\nempathy for others and also problem solving techniques.  We&#39;re really<br/>\nbig on &quot;Do unto others . . .&quot; around here.  And Mom and Dad don&#39;t hide<br/>\nwhen they&#39;ve had their feelings hurt either.
