I will stress these are not my beliefs but things I have picked up from reading, emails , and talking with NO TV proponents.  I had copies of some of the different studies done in Japan about screen time and brain function.  (I&#39;ll note here that they were the actual study reports not some persons idea of what those reports had to say)  Unfortunately my pc blasted off into pop-up spamdem trogen hell and the files along with all else on my pc were lost.  I&#39;ve hunted for them and found two but they were the Japanese version and the translation was not very accurate.  From what I did read there is evidence that yes it does use parts of the brain differently or different part of the brain in combination, than any other activity.  I thought of course it would it is a completely different activity than any other why would they think that was a &#39;finding&#39;.  They also found that some of the parts of the brain that were stimulated or &#39;in use&#39; were parts that were known to activated as pleasure producing,  hinting at a possible addiction factor.  Again what were they watching?  Cartoons are funny make you laugh, pleasure part of the brain are active so how much had to do with content vs. addictive pleasure responses of say play a Video Gambling Machine.  They also found other thing but my kids need me and I haven&#39;t been able to concentrate while writing this I hope it makes some since.  If I find those studies I&#39;ll send them your way so you can tare them apart.  :-D<br/>\n<br/>\n  Teresa in CA<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What is abuse?

How is a child<br/>\nsupposed to grow properly without the right amount of sleep?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat?  You don&#39;t vaccinate?  If your child dies from one of these<br/>\npreventable diseases, you should be charged with murder!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re only having one child?  But you *have* to give a child a sibling.<br/>\nHey, Lady, why do you have so many kids?  Don&#39;t you know you can&#39;t possibly<br/>\nlove them all the way they deserve to be loved?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re not paying for your kid&#39;s college?  How is he supposed to make it in<br/>\nlife when he starts with so much debt?  or How is he supposed to concentrate<br/>\non his studies when he&#39;s worried about money?   I can&#39;t believe that you&#39;re<br/>\npaying for her tuition, room, board and incidentals.  You&#39;re spoiling that<br/>\ngirl and she&#39;ll never learn to be responsible for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s not discuss the merits and shortcomings of these various parental<br/>\nstyles and decisions.  The point I am making is that everyone parents<br/>\ndifferently.  One mom&#39;s freedom is another mom&#39;s neglect.  One dad&#39;s<br/>\ndiscipline is another dad&#39;s abuse.  Almost everyone can agree on things that<br/>\nare *definitely* abuse, but there is a whole lot of gray surrounding the<br/>\nother stuff.  All of the different types of parenting turn out all of the<br/>\ndifferent types of people.  Responsible citizens are formed in all types of<br/>\nfamilies.  Sociopaths are formed in all types of families.  (Don&#39;t ask me<br/>\nfor any examples...I don&#39;t know what kind of parenting style Ted Bundy&#39;s<br/>\nparents had...probably authoritarian and 15 people will write to tell me so!<br/>\nBut then why didn&#39;t his brothers and sisters turn out to be real whack-jobs?<br/>\nProbably because he didn&#39;t have any and a different 15 people will write to<br/>\ntell me that! *twitter sigh*  That&#39;s why I said don&#39;t ask for examples.)<br/>\nPeople are people and there is no perfect way to parent that fits all<br/>\nfamilies, or even all children.  Most parents do the best they know how at<br/>\nthe time.  Children grow up and make their own choices in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe laws need to be loose so that parents can do their jobs in the best way<br/>\nthey know how.  The best way to convince parents not to spank their children<br/>\nis to be a good example.  Don&#39;t decide you can&#39;t be friends with someone<br/>\nbecause they believe in spanking and coercion as parenting tools.  I know a<br/>\nwhole lot of parents who used to spank but saw a better way in a friend or<br/>\nneighbor.  Change is hard.  It&#39;s nearly impossible when you are surrounded<br/>\nby a bunch of people who all believe the same way.  It&#39;s also a lot harder<br/>\nif you are being attacked and your instinct is to deny, deny, deny.  This<br/>\ngoes for most of the parenting techniques.  It usually takes a slow burning<br/>\nexposure to a different way for people to realize that this could really<br/>\nwork.  And then there is the whole process of actually implementing the new<br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if the above quote meant to, but it seems to be equating<br/>\n&quot;traditional acceptable&quot; parenting practices with the neglect and abuse of<br/>\nthat NC family.
