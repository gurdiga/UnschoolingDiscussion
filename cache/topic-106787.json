What can happen in those groups,<br/>\ntoo, is that someone like your son is bothered by a few of those<br/>\nincidents, and his anxiety increases around the group.  The group<br/>\npicks up on that, and starts poking at him more and more.  It can fall<br/>\ninto a really bad dynamic, and one that the adults there don&#39;t<br/>\ncomprehend at all.  The adults continue to see your son as &quot;such a<br/>\nnice guy,&quot; and that exacerbates his role among the kids, too,<br/>\nespecially if the adults try to stick up for him or get the teasing to<br/>\nstop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying this dynamic definitely *will* happen, but it can.  I&#39;m<br/>\nsure we&#39;ve all seen it happen at school and at camps in our own<br/>\nchildhoods.

And then he earned the<br/>\n  nickname trenchfoot.<br/>\n<br/>\n  At this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>\n  keep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>\n  boys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>\n  limit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>\n  according to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>\n  to do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>\n<br/>\n  And the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>\n  pillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>\n  an odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>\n  into another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>\n  whole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I tell  ya, it&#39;s not uncommon for me or my son or my husband to be<br/>\n  getting<br/>\n  &gt; ready for something BIG and then right before think, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\n  really want to<br/>\n  &gt; go/do.&quot;  With me it&#39;s usually an expression of the  overwhelming<br/>\n  nature of<br/>\n  &gt; getting ready.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; With Will it&#39;s usually fear of what&#39;s going to happen.  Fear of the<br/>\n  unknown.<br/>\n  &gt;  We usually help him push through it, because on those  occasions<br/>\n  where he&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; really changed his mind he has regretted it SO much.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; The most recent example is regarding rollercoasters. Will is<br/>\n  fascinated by<br/>\n  &gt; them and loves to build them on the computer.  But when he sees one<br/>\n  in  person<br/>\n  &gt; with its really high chain hill and loop d&#39;loop, it totally freaks<br/>\n  him  out.<br/>\n  &gt; He stiffens and clings to me and things are going on in his head and<br/>\n  it&#39;s a<br/>\n  &gt; true fear.  He rides the ones that don&#39;t go upside down with no<br/>\n  problem<br/>\n  &gt; whatsoever.  He&#39;s had plenty of opportunities to ride the big  ones,<br/>\n  but up until<br/>\n  &gt; now he just hasn&#39;t been able to.  It causes great stress  and<br/>\n  gnashing of teeth<br/>\n  &gt; and he says some really awful things about himself.   It&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; something he really wants to do, but just can&#39;t bring  himself to do it<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Then, on the way home hours later, after we&#39;ve ridden all but the<br/>\n  big  ones,<br/>\n  &gt; he has more gnashing of teeth and self-loathing because he DIDN&#39;T<br/>\n  ride the<br/>\n  &gt; big ones while he had the chance.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Last Saturday at Siliver Dollar City, my husband and I coerced him<br/>\n  to stay<br/>\n  &gt; in line with us on the Powder Keg.  This after he had his fear and<br/>\n  &gt; self-loathing attack, but expressed that he WANTS to ride it.  Told<br/>\n  him he  could walk<br/>\n  &gt; right through the seats and out the other side if he just couldn&#39;t<br/>\n  sit down.<br/>\n  &gt; Half way through the line while he was waivering and hating<br/>\n  himself, I just<br/>\n  &gt; finally told him he was staying in the line--not mean, not<br/>\n  conditioned on<br/>\n  &gt; riding--just that he had to stay in the line.  And then I<br/>\n  encouraged him by saying<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;be afraid, but ride it anyway.&quot;  As the time  passed and he saw the<br/>\n  way the<br/>\n  &gt; train is loaded, etc., he just got through the  fear, and by the<br/>\n  time he got<br/>\n  &gt; to sit down, he wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  It was  a hump he had to get<br/>\n  over; fear<br/>\n  &gt; of the unknown.  As soon as he KNEW, he  wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  He<br/>\n  rode it<br/>\n  &gt; twice.  Then he rode Wildfire--the  biggest one in the park, and<br/>\n  recounted all<br/>\n  &gt; the coasters he faced and couldn&#39;t  ride before--and how that was<br/>\n  all in the<br/>\n  &gt; past, because now he had conquered his  fear of going upside down<br/>\n  and up high.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; And on the way home, he had no regrets.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I think it&#39;s pretty normal to have doubts about something big like a<br/>\n  trip<br/>\n  &gt; away from home.  I&#39;d try to fix something like anticipated bullying,<br/>\n  though,<br/>\n  &gt; without making my kid a bigger target.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Karen<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--<br/>\n  Yahoo!

Lots of times teasing gets <br/>\nto become the way kids relate - and some kids think it is &quot;just <br/>\nteasing&quot; and doesn&#39;t really mean anything and that the teasing kids are <br/>\njust &quot;fooling around,&quot; and stuff like that. So they ignore it when <br/>\nsomebody is getting teased. But - if a trusted adult whom the kids know <br/>\nand like will just mention that they&#39;ve heard there is teasing going on <br/>\nand that people&#39;s feelings are getting hurt and that it is up to them <br/>\nto create an atmosphere in which teasing isn&#39;t the way kids relate to <br/>\neach other -- that can make a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a big lecture. Not a big huge deal made of it. Talking not to the <br/>\nteasers, but to the kids who are standing by and letting it go on. <br/>\nOften they&#39;re uncomfortable, too, and it just takes bringing it out <br/>\ninto the open to get them to be willing to say something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - the kid being teased might benefit from a bit of what used to be <br/>\nknown as &quot;assertiveness training&quot; - learning to say, &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me <br/>\nlike that anymore, I really don&#39;t like it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to the parents of the teasing kid - that seems unlikely to help <br/>\nand could make things worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Boy Scout Trouble","postDate":"1119294279","msgId":106827,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMy4zZTM2MjIzYy4yZmU4NmQ0N0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106823,"nextInTopic":106828,"prevInTime":106826,"nextInTime":106828,"topicId":106787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/20/2005 11:17:27 AM Mountain Daylight Time, tuckervill2@aol.com writes: Which would be less likely to make bullies stop bullying,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-900900814\">In a message dated 6/20/2005 11:17:27 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich would be less likely to make bullies stop bullying,   though:   &quot;You <br/>\ntattled&quot; or &quot;Your mom talked to the leaders  and  you&#39;re a baby&quot;?   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome bullying just needs to  be  avoided.

That doesn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t WANT to.  He clearly WANTED to.   <br/>\n&gt; Clearly. <br/>\n&gt; Unequivocally wanted to.  Over and over again, at many many  amusement <br/>\n&gt; parks,<br/>\n&gt; over a number of years since he was 3.  He wanted  to.

We only knew it was a hump <br/>\n&gt; after  he got<br/>\n&gt; over it.

I told my mother it was <br/>\ntoo soon because of all of Josh&#39;s fears, but she was footing the bill <br/>\nand he wanted to go and I knew the opportunity might never come again. <br/>\n(We just HAD to go then because the next year my nephew (who was also <br/>\ntoo young) would be in school and God knows they would not take him out <br/>\nfor a week so we could go to WDW in early May.) Josh had fun, I had fun, <br/>\nbut it drove my mother (and my sister) crazy that Josh and my nephew <br/>\nwould not go in any shows (too dark) or any ride that looked too scary. <br/>\nMy poor nephew melted down in the &quot;Honey I shrunk the Kids&quot; playground <br/>\nwhen the 1st thing he saw was the 10 foot plastic spider. Josh went <br/>\nhysterical (screaming and crying---of course we left) while watching the <br/>\n&quot;famous&quot; nightly fireworks &#39;cause he thought they were going to hit and <br/>\nkill us.....even when they did not hit and kill us.<br/>\nMostly the boys swam in all the cool pools and looked at stuff.<br/>\nAt that point in Josh&#39;s life it also drove me crazy, but I kept my mouth <br/>\nshut for the most part, and did not force him to do anything he was <br/>\nafraid of ---unlike my sister.<br/>\nThe day we left Josh said &quot;I can&#39;t wait till we come again.

And then he earned the<br/>\nnickname trenchfoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this particular camp the tents are built up on 2 by 4 frames to<br/>\nkeep the rain out, when he entered a tent to hang out with some other<br/>\nboys One scout demanded he get out because he was exceeding the weight<br/>\nlimit and was sure to bust the floor.(He is about 25 lbs overweight,<br/>\naccording to &quot;charts&quot;  he&#39;s healthy and it doesn&#39;t affect his ability<br/>\nto do anything so I feel it is no big deal)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the one that really got me, one of the scouts took his pikachu<br/>\npillow, slit it open strung it up to a tree and beat on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the clincher, He got stuck in a tent alone, (2 cots per tent and<br/>\nan odd number of boys) got frightened in the middle of the night, went<br/>\ninto another tent and slept on the floor when he awoke nearly the<br/>\nwhole group then called him sissy boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I tell  ya, it&#39;s not uncommon for me or my son or my husband to be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>getting <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ready for something BIG and then right before think, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>really want to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; go/do.&quot;  With me it&#39;s usually an expression of the  overwhelming<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nature of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; getting ready.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; With Will it&#39;s usually fear of what&#39;s going to happen.

Like a meeting that is generic (no names).  <br/>\nMaking sure that all the boys understand that it is unacceptable and what it <br/>\ndoes to others.  That type of thing.  If they (leaders) want him to stay in <br/>\nthen they will make it better for him.  I see the &quot;boys will be boys&quot; thing too <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t have to cost someone their enjoyment or contentment.  Scouting <br/>\nshould be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, find him a new troop/den.  He may enjoy that.  His closest friends <br/>\nmay be waiting around the corner in another place.  If not, maybe he needs a new <br/>\nthing.  Or a break.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Boy Scout Trouble","postDate":"1119272488","msgId":106795,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhLjE1ODgwZjE5LjJmZTgxODI4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":106791,"nextInTopic":106800,"prevInTime":106794,"nextInTime":106796,"topicId":106787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/20/2005 12:34:35 AM Central Standard Time, mchl_cnkln@yahoo.com writes: What is  all of your opinions?

Or they tease others and he doesn&#39;t like  it?  It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t clear to me.<br/>\n <br/>\nI tell  ya, it&#39;s not uncommon for me or my son or my husband to be  getting <br/>\nready for something BIG and then right before think, &quot;I don&#39;t  really want to <br/>\ngo/do.&quot;  With me it&#39;s usually an expression of the  overwhelming nature of <br/>\ngetting ready.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith Will it&#39;s usually fear of what&#39;s going to happen.  Fear of the  unknown. <br/>\n We usually help him push through it, because on those  occasions where he&#39;s <br/>\nreally changed his mind he has regretted it SO much.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe most recent example is regarding rollercoasters. Will is fascinated by  <br/>\nthem and loves to build them on the computer.  But when he sees one in  person <br/>\nwith its really high chain hill and loop d&#39;loop, it totally freaks him  out.  <br/>\nHe stiffens and clings to me and things are going on in his head and  it&#39;s a <br/>\ntrue fear.  He rides the ones that don&#39;t go upside down with no  problem <br/>\nwhatsoever.  He&#39;s had plenty of opportunities to ride the big  ones, but up until <br/>\nnow he just hasn&#39;t been able to.  It causes great stress  and gnashing of teeth <br/>\nand he says some really awful things about himself.   It&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s <br/>\nsomething he really wants to do, but just can&#39;t bring  himself to do it <br/>\n <br/>\nThen, on the way home hours later, after we&#39;ve ridden all but the big  ones, <br/>\nhe has more gnashing of teeth and self-loathing because he DIDN&#39;T ride the  <br/>\nbig ones while he had the chance.<br/>\n <br/>\nLast Saturday at Siliver Dollar City, my husband and I coerced him to stay  <br/>\nin line with us on the Powder Keg.  This after he had his fear and  <br/>\nself-loathing attack, but expressed that he WANTS to ride it.  Told him he  could walk <br/>\nright through the seats and out the other side if he just couldn&#39;t  sit down.  <br/>\nHalf way through the line while he was waivering and hating  himself, I just <br/>\nfinally told him he was staying in the line--not mean, not  conditioned on <br/>\nriding--just that he had to stay in the line.  And then I  encouraged him by saying <br/>\n&quot;be afraid, but ride it anyway.&quot;  As the time  passed and he saw the way the <br/>\ntrain is loaded, etc., he just got through the  fear, and by the time he got <br/>\nto sit down, he wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  It was  a hump he had to get over; fear <br/>\nof the unknown.  As soon as he KNEW, he  wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  He rode it <br/>\ntwice.  Then he rode Wildfire--the  biggest one in the park, and recounted all <br/>\nthe coasters he faced and couldn&#39;t  ride before--and how that was all in the <br/>\npast, because now he had conquered his  fear of going upside down and up high.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd on the way home, he had no regrets.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s pretty normal to have doubts about something big like a trip  <br/>\naway from home.  I&#39;d try to fix something like anticipated bullying,  though, <br/>\nwithout making my kid a bigger target.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Boy Scout Trouble","postDate":"1119260543","msgId":106791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MmUxZmQxMGRmYWFmODUyZmI4YTYwMWNmMjhjNTk0QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ5NWJxaCs4ZWg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQ5NWJxaCs4ZWg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":106787,"nextInTopic":106795,"prevInTime":106790,"nextInTime":106792,"topicId":106787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
