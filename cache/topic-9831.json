Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the particular<br/>\ntimes for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that I<br/>\nthink feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For one<br/>\nthing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>\nprofessions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) and<br/>\nfriends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue the<br/>\ncareer of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL benefit for<br/>\nhaving that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in important<br/>\nfields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>domestic violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to women<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices more<br/>\navailable because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine religions. <br/>\nWhile religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big boost<br/>\ndue to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism movement<br/>\nand the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>\naccess these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is not so<br/>\nmuch totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>\nduality, the balance.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves through<br/>\n </span></blockquote>dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion and it&#39;s<br/>\nskewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized for<br/>\ntheir uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were largely<br/>\nignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS,<br/>\nMenopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they<br/>\ndeserve.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my head,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives us<br/>\npros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the old<br/>\nways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the information,<br/>\nthe ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the new<br/>\ninto a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it never<br/>\nstop!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\n&gt; Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; Make FREE long distance phone calls online!\t<br/>\n&gt; Click here to use PhoneFREE.com today!<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree\">http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree</a><br/>\n&gt; ******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; STEALS AND DEALS!

I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism &gt;has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we don&#39;t &gt;have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we<br/>\n&gt; &gt;gained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Lynda, who will now jump into her flame proof suit %-}<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmmm...Interesting question Lynda.  Now I have to think right?  OY!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;After<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the week I have had I don&#39;t know if I am functional enough to use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brainpower, and now both my kids are sick and I am taking turns<br/>\n&gt; &gt;running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;between rooms to administer medicine, adjust the steamers, kiss<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sweaty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;little brows and soothe fussy, achey bodies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;particular<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For<br/>\n&gt; &gt;one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL<br/>\n&gt; &gt;benefit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;domestic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;women<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices<br/>\n&gt; &gt;more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine<br/>\n&gt; &gt;religions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big<br/>\n&gt; &gt;boost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism<br/>\n&gt; &gt;movement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality, the balance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves<br/>\n&gt; &gt;through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were<br/>\n&gt; &gt;largely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;deserve.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;head,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives<br/>\n&gt; &gt;us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;information,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;stop!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Make FREE long distance phone calls online!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Click here to use PhoneFREE.com today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree\">http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;STEALS AND DEALS!

It is sad that kids are virtually <br/>\nraising themselves in many homes, including the affluent ones.

I love for her<br/>\nto tell me the stories of her life.  She was an unmarried 20 something with<br/>\na mind of her own.  She decided she wanted to buy 4 lots over near her<br/>\nparents house, so she could build her   own house and build one to sell.  My<br/>\ngrandfather was a carpenter and he had agreed to  help build the houses. She<br/>\nwent to the bank with the down payment saved. She asked for a loan for the<br/>\nrest of the property.  She even took my grandfather with her.

I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism &gt;has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;feminism,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we don&#39;t &gt;have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we <br/>\n&gt;gained?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Lynda, who will now jump into her flame proof suit %-}<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmmm...Interesting question Lynda.  Now I have to think right?  OY!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;After<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the week I have had I don&#39;t know if I am functional enough to use<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brainpower, and now both my kids are sick and I am taking turns <br/>\n&gt;running<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;between rooms to administer medicine, adjust the steamers, kiss <br/>\n&gt;sweaty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;little brows and soothe fussy, achey bodies.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the <br/>\n&gt;particular<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that <br/>\n&gt;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For <br/>\n&gt;one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL <br/>\n&gt;benefit<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in <br/>\n&gt;important<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;domestic<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to <br/>\n&gt;women<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices <br/>\n&gt;more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine <br/>\n&gt;religions.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big <br/>\n&gt;boost<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism <br/>\n&gt;movement<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is <br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality, the balance.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves <br/>\n&gt;through<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were <br/>\n&gt;largely<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;deserve.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my <br/>\n&gt;head,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives <br/>\n&gt;us<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the <br/>\n&gt;old<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the <br/>\n&gt;information,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the <br/>\n&gt;new<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;stop!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nanci K.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Show off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) <br/>\n&gt;today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Make FREE long distance phone calls online!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Click here to use PhoneFREE.com today!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree\">http://adserv.internetfuel.com/cgi-bin/newredirect.cgi?AD=EMAIL-phonefree</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;******************************************************<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;STEALS AND DEALS!

Nothing can be completely attributed to <br/>\n&gt;feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the particular <br/>\n&gt;times for each thing.

For one <br/>\n&gt;thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot; <br/>\n&gt;professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) and <br/>\n&gt;friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue the <br/>\n&gt;career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL benefit for <br/>\n&gt;having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in important <br/>\n&gt;fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in domestic <br/>\n&gt;violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to women in <br/>\n&gt;religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices more <br/>\n&gt;available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine religions.  <br/>\n&gt;While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big boost <br/>\n&gt;due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism movement <br/>\n&gt;and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to <br/>\n&gt;access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is not so <br/>\n&gt;much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the <br/>\n&gt;duality, the balance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves through <br/>\n&gt;dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion and it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only are <br/>\n&gt;women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized for <br/>\n&gt;their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were largely <br/>\n&gt;ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS, <br/>\n&gt;Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they <br/>\n&gt;deserve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my head, <br/>\n&gt;with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives us <br/>\n&gt;pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the old <br/>\n&gt;ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.
