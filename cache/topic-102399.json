Okay, I know this is  <br/>\n&gt; revoltingly<br/>\n&gt; early, but I’ve discovered that getting up early and finishing up  my <br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; jobs allows me to lie on the sofa like a slug in the evenings after  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; children go to bed. This fall, I’m teaching two classes at William &  <br/>\n&gt; Mary,<br/>\n&gt; so I have plenty of grading to do. This morning, I blow the grading <br/>\n&gt; off  and<br/>\n&gt; work on my newest writing project instead: W. W. Norton has asked me  <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; write a history of the world for grown-ups. The Assyrian Kings List  is<br/>\n&gt; remarkably hard to convert into stirring narrative.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7 AM Emily  wails. I go into her room; she’s sitting up in bed <br/>\n&gt; clutching her<br/>\n&gt; blanket. “I  had a nightmare!” she screams when she sees me. “What was <br/>\n&gt; it?”<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; ask. “There  was a dark dark CAVE!” Emily yells. “I was in a dark dark <br/>\n&gt; CAVE!”<br/>\n&gt; “It was just  pretend,” I say; this is my usual response, but she’s not<br/>\n&gt; buying it today.  “It was DARK!” she says, accusingly. So I turn on <br/>\n&gt; her lamp.<br/>\n&gt; “Were you all  alone in the cave?” I ask. “No,” she says, in a voice of<br/>\n&gt; doom.<br/>\n&gt; “ALL OF THE  BROTHERS were there!” Hmm. I’m not sure whether that’s <br/>\n&gt; part of<br/>\n&gt; the nightmare  or not. I lay her down, change her diaper, and give her <br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; bottle (I know,  three is too old for a bottle, but she’ll drink it <br/>\n&gt; and go<br/>\n&gt; straight back to  sleep).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 7:30 AM Shower, dress, dry hair, put on shoes. This isn’t one of  my <br/>\n&gt; William<br/>\n&gt; & Mary days, so we have a lot of school to get through. My  husband <br/>\n&gt; Peter<br/>\n&gt; will take over at 3 PM to do math, geography, and handwriting;  he’ll <br/>\n&gt; send<br/>\n&gt; Daniel (7) over to see my mother for a reading lesson and he’ll  <br/>\n&gt; supervise<br/>\n&gt; some of the tasks that Christopher (12) and Ben (10)) can do on  their <br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; (typing, Latin vocabulary cards, spelling worksheets).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8 PM  I go get everyone up. Christopher is already up reading; he’s an <br/>\n&gt; early<br/>\n&gt; riser  and has already been out to do some of his chores. Ben is sound<br/>\n&gt; asleep; he’s  a late riser, and when I try to wake him up he curls <br/>\n&gt; into a<br/>\n&gt; ball and puts his  head under his knees. I get Emily and put her in <br/>\n&gt; his bed.<br/>\n&gt; Daniel comes out of  his room and stands in the middle of the floor. <br/>\n&gt; “Time to<br/>\n&gt; get dressed,” I say.  “I don’t have any clothes,” he says. I walk him <br/>\n&gt; back<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; his room, take out  his clothes and put them in a stack on the floor. <br/>\n&gt; He<br/>\n&gt; looks at them. “Oh,” he  says. “Those clothes.”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8:10 Christopher is waiting by the door to go out.  All three boys <br/>\n&gt; generally<br/>\n&gt; take the dogs for a long walk before breakfast; we  live on a farm, <br/>\n&gt; but since<br/>\n&gt; it’s hunting season, we keep the dogs in their pen  for most of the <br/>\n&gt; day. Ben<br/>\n&gt; is dressing. Emily is in the middle of Ben’s bed  making a stuffed <br/>\n&gt; animal<br/>\n&gt; pyramid. Daniel comes out of his room with no clothes  on and a Lego <br/>\n&gt; robot in<br/>\n&gt; one hand. “Mom,” he says, “do you know why this guy is  special?” “Get<br/>\n&gt; DRESSED,” I say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8:15 Ben and Christopher are standing  by the door. Daniel hops out of <br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; room on one foot, wearing two socks and  nothing else. “Mom!” he says. <br/>\n&gt; “If<br/>\n&gt; people only had one leg, they would keep  falling over!” “PANTS,” I <br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8:20 Daniel is wearing socks and pants and  nothing else. I tell <br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt; and Ben to go out and start feeding the dogs  while I dress Daniel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 8:30 I put Emily in her high chair with raisins and  start on <br/>\n&gt; breakfast. By<br/>\n&gt; the time the boys come back in, eggs and toast are  ready. Daniel goes <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; gets his two favorite Lego robots to keep him company.  Ben and <br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt; ask if they can read at the table. “Yes,” I say, pleased  to see this <br/>\n&gt; love<br/>\n&gt; for words. They produce Bloom County and The Ultimate Guide  to <br/>\n&gt; Spiderman:<br/>\n&gt; His Life and Ways. Oh, well.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9 I clear the table and run  the boys through their chores: Christopher<br/>\n&gt; vacuums, Ben cleans up Emily’s  room, Daniel sweeps down the steps. <br/>\n&gt; He’s<br/>\n&gt; still sweeping by the time the older  boys are done. I tell <br/>\n&gt; Christopher to<br/>\n&gt; start on his Latin (we always do this  first thing) and Ben to go do <br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; reading. Right now he’s reading all the way  through the Little House <br/>\n&gt; on the<br/>\n&gt; Prairie series. He’s up to Farmer Boy; this  has nothing to do with the<br/>\n&gt; period of history we’re learning, but Ben is going  through a<br/>\n&gt; comic-book-and-Star-Wars-junior-novel stage, so I’m doing my best  to <br/>\n&gt; broaden<br/>\n&gt; his little horizon.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:10 Christopher has forgotten all the  Latin he ever knew.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:15 I tell Christopher to go run around the house.  He goes, <br/>\n&gt; sheepishly.<br/>\n&gt; When he comes back in he says, “Sorry.” “Is your brain  in gear?” I <br/>\n&gt; ask.<br/>\n&gt; “Er,” he says, “mostly.”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:20 Daniel is still  sweeping the stairs. Christopher has forgotten <br/>\n&gt; what a<br/>\n&gt; direct object is. I  give Emily crayons and paper and trace her hands <br/>\n&gt; while I<br/>\n&gt; make up about fifty  short sentences with direct objects and make <br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt; identify them.  “Okay, okay,” he says, after sentence forty-five. “I <br/>\n&gt; get it.”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:25 I  explain the passive pluperfect to Christopher. He looks at the <br/>\n&gt; forms.<br/>\n&gt; “You  have to be kidding,” he says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:30 Ben emerges, having finished his  chapter, and asks if he can <br/>\n&gt; practice<br/>\n&gt; his piano. “What was your chapter  about?” I say. “They went to a <br/>\n&gt; place and<br/>\n&gt; did something,” he says. “Go back  and read it again,” I say, “and <br/>\n&gt; tell me<br/>\n&gt; where they went and what they  did.”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:40 Christopher has completed one of his five drill sentences.  <br/>\n&gt; Daniel is<br/>\n&gt; still sweeping the steps. Emily announces, “I have to go potty.” I  <br/>\n&gt; take her<br/>\n&gt; into the bathroom and sit beside her. Christopher yells, “Help!”  “Try <br/>\n&gt; to do<br/>\n&gt; it yourself,” I yell back. There is a long silence. When I come  back <br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen, he’s on Sentence 2.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 9:50 Ben comes back out.  “They went into town and sold WHEAT!” he says<br/>\n&gt; triumphantly. “Good job,” I  say. “Go practice your piano.” I look up <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; stairs. Daniel is sitting on the  fourth step, sweeping his head with <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; brush. “STAIRS,” I say.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 10 AM  Daniel finishes the stairs. “Go get First Language Lessons,” I <br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt; Emily is  now under the table tickling Christopher’s feet. “Mom,” <br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt; says, “I  can’t think.” He is now on Sentence 3.” I say, “Emily, what <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; doing?”  “I loving Pipher,” Emily says.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 10:15 Christopher finishes Sentence 5.  “Okay,” I say. “Good job. That <br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; took you an hour and ten minutes. Can I  give you a brain massage?” “I <br/>\n&gt; think<br/>\n&gt; I need some sugar,” he says. I feed  everyone cookies and send <br/>\n&gt; Christopher to<br/>\n&gt; practice his trumpet. Emily is  bored; I tell Ben to quit practicing <br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; piano and read her a book while I do  Daniel’s grammar. Today, his <br/>\n&gt; lesson is<br/>\n&gt; action verbs. We repeat, “A verb is a  word that does an action, shows <br/>\n&gt; state<br/>\n&gt; of being, links two words, or helps  another verb” five times; then I <br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; action verbs while he acts them out.  Ben and Emily abandon their book <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; join in. Christopher appears. “I want to  do it too,” he says. Soon <br/>\n&gt; they are<br/>\n&gt; screaming, jumping, running, yelling,  falling, wrestling, and singing <br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; over the house. I try, “Whisper! Sleep!  Think!” These are much less <br/>\n&gt; popular<br/>\n&gt; action verbs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 10:30 I send  everyone outside while I drink a cup of coffee. <br/>\n&gt; Christopher<br/>\n&gt; offers to push  Emily on the swing. While they’re out I look at their <br/>\n&gt; school<br/>\n&gt; lists;  Christopher still has a massive amount of work to do this <br/>\n&gt; morning. I<br/>\n&gt; go  outside too, and Emily and I feed the dogs Milk-Bones through the <br/>\n&gt; fence<br/>\n&gt; while  the boys charge off into the distance.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11 AM I yell, “Time to come in!”  Eventually the boys reappear. “Aw,”<br/>\n&gt; Christopher says, “we were just getting  going.” “What were you <br/>\n&gt; playing?” I<br/>\n&gt; ask. “Space Age,” he says. “I’m a Space  Age kitty!” Daniel announces.<br/>\n&gt; Christopher says, “We had to have Space Age  kitties in the game so <br/>\n&gt; Daniel<br/>\n&gt; could play.” Then he stage-whispers, “Ben and I  pretend he’s a <br/>\n&gt; Lizardman<br/>\n&gt; General, but he thinks he’s a kitty.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11:10  Christopher goes back to his trumpet. I put Emily back in her <br/>\n&gt; chair<br/>\n&gt; with her  crayons. She’s not buying it. “Want to go show Grammy my <br/>\n&gt; shoes,”<br/>\n&gt; she says.  “Not right now,” I say. “Ben, go get your grammar.” “Want <br/>\n&gt; to show<br/>\n&gt; Grammy my  ballerina skirt,” she says. “Not right now,” I say. Small <br/>\n&gt; silence.<br/>\n&gt; “Want to  show Grammy my belly,” she suggests. “We’ll go see Grammy <br/>\n&gt; later,”<br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; say. I  put on her ballerina skirt and play “Hall of the Mountain <br/>\n&gt; King” on<br/>\n&gt; the stereo  while she and Daniel run around the room in circles. <br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile I<br/>\n&gt; go through  Ben’s grammar lesson with him; today he’s supposed to <br/>\n&gt; diagram<br/>\n&gt; sentences from  the Rod & Staff fifth-grade book. His grammar has <br/>\n&gt; improved<br/>\n&gt; since we  switched from the A Beka workbooks; he’s a very reluctant <br/>\n&gt; writer,<br/>\n&gt; but for  some reason copying out the exercises from the non-consumable <br/>\n&gt; Rod &<br/>\n&gt; Staff  book has proved easier for him than completing the workbook <br/>\n&gt; pages.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11:30  Christopher finishes his trumpet and comes back out. “Reading,” <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt; “Yeah!” Christopher says and disappears again. He’s reading The Once  <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; Future King, and has announced that it is his VERY FAVORITE BOOK EVER. <br/>\n&gt;  This<br/>\n&gt; warms my heart. I adored this book when I was twelve.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11:40 Ben  has done one of his eight sentences. I give him M&Ms. Sugar <br/>\n&gt; is a<br/>\n&gt; vital  component of the successful home school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 11:45 Emily falls over while  skidding around a corner and starts to <br/>\n&gt; bellow.<br/>\n&gt; I turn off the music, pick her  up, and send Daniel to get his <br/>\n&gt; spelling book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12 noon Ben has done two of  his eight sentences. I set the buzzer and <br/>\n&gt; tell<br/>\n&gt; him that if he’s not finished  in ten minutes, I’ll give him eight <br/>\n&gt; more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12:05 Ben has finished his  grammar lesson. I tell him to play with <br/>\n&gt; Emily<br/>\n&gt; until Dan’s spelling is  finished.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12:20 Christopher’s finished reading. I don’t ask him questions  about <br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; Once and Future King; I clearly remember this book taking me into a  <br/>\n&gt; universe<br/>\n&gt; so real that I didn’t want to talk about it. Instead I decide to do  <br/>\n&gt; history<br/>\n&gt; with everyone simultaneously. I give Emily the math pattern blocks,  <br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; she pours on the floor and sits on. “These are my eggs,” she says. “I  <br/>\n&gt; will<br/>\n&gt; have a baby chicken. Can I go show Grammy my baby chicken?” “Later,” I <br/>\n&gt;  say.<br/>\n&gt; I tell the boys to get their colored pencils while I clear the table.  <br/>\n&gt; We’re<br/>\n&gt; still doing medieval-renaissance history, because (like a lot of  other<br/>\n&gt; people) we’re waiting on publication of Vol. 3 of The Story of the  <br/>\n&gt; World. I<br/>\n&gt; give all three boys the map of the Franks and have them color the  <br/>\n&gt; three<br/>\n&gt; separate territories while I read aloud. When I get to Clovis I give  <br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; the coloring page of Clovis’s baptism. “Was he really a  Christian?”<br/>\n&gt; Christopher asks. “He promised to become a Christian before he  even <br/>\n&gt; knew<br/>\n&gt; what Christianity was all about,” I say. “Listen.” I reread the  story <br/>\n&gt; of the<br/>\n&gt; baptism. “What do you think?” I say. “Nope!” Ben says  cheerfully. “We <br/>\n&gt; can’<br/>\n&gt; t<br/>\n&gt; know for sure,” I say, “but I think the chances are  against it.” <br/>\n&gt; Daniel<br/>\n&gt; says, “Look! He doesn’t have any clothes on in this  picture!”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 12:40 I put Ben in front of the Usborne Internet-Linked History  <br/>\n&gt; Encyclopedia<br/>\n&gt; and tell him to read the section on the Franks and write down  the <br/>\n&gt; three most<br/>\n&gt; important things he learns. When I get the Kingfisher History  <br/>\n&gt; Encyclopedia<br/>\n&gt; out, Christopher groans and says, “Do I have to outline today?”  “You <br/>\n&gt; can do<br/>\n&gt; a composition instead,” I say. “About what?” “Er,” I say,  thinking. <br/>\n&gt; “Er,<br/>\n&gt; how<br/>\n&gt; about comparing Clovis to King Arthur?” “That’s a lot,”  Christopher <br/>\n&gt; says,<br/>\n&gt; dubiously. “You can type it,” I say, “and today you can  make a list of<br/>\n&gt; comparisons, and then actually finish the composition itself  <br/>\n&gt; tomorrow.”<br/>\n&gt; Christopher agrees and goes off to his room, where he has a  computer <br/>\n&gt; (NOT<br/>\n&gt; connected to the Internet). Daniel says, “Can I go play with  Legos?” <br/>\n&gt; “Who<br/>\n&gt; was the history lesson about?” I ask. “A guy without clothes,”  he <br/>\n&gt; says.<br/>\n&gt; Emily announces, “POTTY!” “Okay,” I say, “go play Legos.”<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1  PM Lunch. Christopher has made a list of comparisons, Ben has <br/>\n&gt; written  two<br/>\n&gt; sentences. I tell him to write one more before he can eat. While <br/>\n&gt; everyone  is<br/>\n&gt; stuffing down PBJ and chips, I decide that our diet has too much sugar <br/>\n&gt;  and<br/>\n&gt; salt in it and bring out a bag of baby carrots. “Three for everyone!”  <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; announce. There; that’ll balance out their diets, right?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 1:20 PM  It’s rest time. Pete will be back soon to take over school at <br/>\n&gt; 3  PM.<br/>\n&gt; Christopher hasn’t yet done his grammar or his writing. I pull out his <br/>\n&gt;  Rod &<br/>\n&gt; Staff book, review the lesson with him, and tell him to finish it  <br/>\n&gt; along with<br/>\n&gt; his Wordsmith lesson during rest time, before he does anything  else. <br/>\n&gt; I’ll<br/>\n&gt; check it when he’s finished. Christopher’s independence level  (except <br/>\n&gt; for<br/>\n&gt; Latin) has rocketed during this past year; I’m beginning to think  <br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; might actually survive middle school. I settle Emily down for her  <br/>\n&gt; rest, send<br/>\n&gt; Daniel to play with Legos (again) and sit down with Ben and his  Prima<br/>\n&gt; Latina. Today we’re doing new vocabulary words and new endings. We  <br/>\n&gt; talk<br/>\n&gt; about each word and I give him index cards to make new vocabulary  <br/>\n&gt; flash<br/>\n&gt; cards. “Finish them in your room,” I say, “and then you can listen to  <br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; tape and play.” All of the boys are listening to books on tape  during<br/>\n&gt; naptime; Ben is listening to The Dragonslayers, Daniel to Mrs.  <br/>\n&gt; Piggle-Wiggle<br/>\n&gt; ’s Farm, and Christopher to Cheaper by the Dozen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With  everyone in his room, I sit down to take stock of the morning.<br/>\n&gt; Christopher  hasn’t done his logic; he has taken a scunner to Jim <br/>\n&gt; Nance,<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately,  and I’m about ready to pitch it and try something <br/>\n&gt; else. My<br/>\n&gt; options are  limited. Maybe I’ll do the Critical Thinking Press books <br/>\n&gt; with<br/>\n&gt; him for a year  and then try to find a tutor. I did Dan’s spelling and<br/>\n&gt; grammar with him, but  I didn’t get to copywork; my mother usually <br/>\n&gt; does some<br/>\n&gt; handwriting with him  after his afternooon reading lesson, though, so <br/>\n&gt; I’ll<br/>\n&gt; ask her to fold copywork  into her lesson. Although Daniel is seven, <br/>\n&gt; he’s a<br/>\n&gt; young seven (his birthday  is the last week of October), and we’re <br/>\n&gt; hovering<br/>\n&gt; between first and second  grade work with him. I see that Ben was <br/>\n&gt; supposed to<br/>\n&gt; do typing this morning  for me because it’s a heavy math day for Pete, <br/>\n&gt; but I<br/>\n&gt; forgot. I draw an arrow  on his chart over to Pete’s side of the chart <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; write in, “Typing if you  have time?” Just then Emily yells. I go in <br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; room. “I had a NIGHTMARE!” she  bellows. “You weren’t asleep,” I tell <br/>\n&gt; her.<br/>\n&gt; At<br/>\n&gt; three, Emily doesn’t sleep any  more during rest time; she plays with <br/>\n&gt; toys on<br/>\n&gt; her floor. “There was a TALKING  BEAN in my closet!” she announces. <br/>\n&gt; “It’s a<br/>\n&gt; friendly bean,” I say. “It’s time  to get up,” Emily says. “Not yet,” I<br/>\n&gt; say.<br/>\n&gt; “Yes, it is. I have to go see  Grammy and tell her about the talking <br/>\n&gt; bean.”<br/>\n&gt; “LATER,” I say. When I go back  out I write on Pete’s side of the <br/>\n&gt; school<br/>\n&gt; chart, “Take Emmy to see Grammy.” I  go upstairs and prop my feet up. <br/>\n&gt; In a<br/>\n&gt; few minutes I need to go work on the  grading I blew off first thing <br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; morning. (Rest time comes first,  though.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I made up <br/>\n my definition and said I&#39;d never looked it up, though, just learned it from  <br/>\nhearing it.  Holly went and got the American Heritage (she had several  <br/>\noptions, but went for that one) and looked it up.  It had part of my  definition <br/>\n(the light-headedness) but not the sudden happiness.

Okay, I know this is  revoltingly<br/>\nearly, but I’ve discovered that getting up early and finishing up  my own<br/>\njobs allows me to lie on the sofa like a slug in the evenings after  the<br/>\nchildren go to bed. This fall, I’m teaching two classes at William &  Mary,<br/>\nso I have plenty of grading to do. This morning, I blow the grading off  and<br/>\nwork on my newest writing project instead: W. W. Norton has asked me  to<br/>\nwrite a history of the world for grown-ups. The Assyrian Kings List  is<br/>\nremarkably hard to convert into stirring narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\n7 AM Emily  wails. I go into her room; she’s sitting up in bed clutching her<br/>\nblanket. “I  had a nightmare!” she screams when she sees me. “What was it?” <br/>\nI<br/>\nask. “There  was a dark dark CAVE!” Emily yells. “I was in a dark dark CAVE!”<br/>\n“It was just  pretend,” I say; this is my usual response, but she’s not<br/>\nbuying it today.  “It was DARK!” she says, accusingly. So I turn on her lamp.<br/>\n“Were you all  alone in the cave?” I ask. “No,” she says, in a voice of <br/>\ndoom.<br/>\n“ALL OF THE  BROTHERS were there!” Hmm. I’m not sure whether that’s part of<br/>\nthe nightmare  or not. I lay her down, change her diaper, and give her a<br/>\nbottle (I know,  three is too old for a bottle, but she’ll drink it and go<br/>\nstraight back to  sleep).<br/>\n<br/>\n7:30 AM Shower, dress, dry hair, put on shoes. This isn’t one of  my William<br/>\n& Mary days, so we have a lot of school to get through. My  husband Peter<br/>\nwill take over at 3 PM to do math, geography, and handwriting;  he’ll send<br/>\nDaniel (7) over to see my mother for a reading lesson and he’ll  supervise<br/>\nsome of the tasks that Christopher (12) and Ben (10)) can do on  their own<br/>\n(typing, Latin vocabulary cards, spelling worksheets).<br/>\n<br/>\n8 PM  I go get everyone up. Christopher is already up reading; he’s an early<br/>\nriser  and has already been out to do some of his chores. Ben is sound<br/>\nasleep; he’s  a late riser, and when I try to wake him up he curls into a<br/>\nball and puts his  head under his knees. I get Emily and put her in his bed.<br/>\nDaniel comes out of  his room and stands in the middle of the floor. “Time to<br/>\nget dressed,” I say.  “I don’t have any clothes,” he says. I walk him back <br/>\nto<br/>\nhis room, take out  his clothes and put them in a stack on the floor. He<br/>\nlooks at them. “Oh,” he  says. “Those clothes.”<br/>\n<br/>\n8:10 Christopher is waiting by the door to go out.  All three boys generally<br/>\ntake the dogs for a long walk before breakfast; we  live on a farm, but since<br/>\nit’s hunting season, we keep the dogs in their pen  for most of the day. Ben<br/>\nis dressing. Emily is in the middle of Ben’s bed  making a stuffed animal<br/>\npyramid. Daniel comes out of his room with no clothes  on and a Lego robot in<br/>\none hand. “Mom,” he says, “do you know why this guy is  special?” “Get<br/>\nDRESSED,” I say.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:15 Ben and Christopher are standing  by the door. Daniel hops out of his<br/>\nroom on one foot, wearing two socks and  nothing else. “Mom!” he says. “If<br/>\npeople only had one leg, they would keep  falling over!” “PANTS,” I say.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:20 Daniel is wearing socks and pants and  nothing else. I tell Christopher<br/>\nand Ben to go out and start feeding the dogs  while I dress Daniel.<br/>\n<br/>\n8:30 I put Emily in her high chair with raisins and  start on breakfast. By<br/>\nthe time the boys come back in, eggs and toast are  ready. Daniel goes and<br/>\ngets his two favorite Lego robots to keep him company.  Ben and Christopher<br/>\nask if they can read at the table. “Yes,” I say, pleased  to see this love<br/>\nfor words. They produce Bloom County and The Ultimate Guide  to Spiderman:<br/>\nHis Life and Ways. Oh, well.<br/>\n<br/>\n9 I clear the table and run  the boys through their chores: Christopher<br/>\nvacuums, Ben cleans up Emily’s  room, Daniel sweeps down the steps. He’s<br/>\nstill sweeping by the time the older  boys are done. I tell Christopher to<br/>\nstart on his Latin (we always do this  first thing) and Ben to go do his<br/>\nreading. Right now he’s reading all the way  through the Little House on the<br/>\nPrairie series. He’s up to Farmer Boy; this  has nothing to do with the<br/>\nperiod of history we’re learning, but Ben is going  through a<br/>\ncomic-book-and-Star-Wars-junior-novel stage, so I’m doing my best  to broaden<br/>\nhis little horizon.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:10 Christopher has forgotten all the  Latin he ever knew.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:15 I tell Christopher to go run around the house.  He goes, sheepishly.<br/>\nWhen he comes back in he says, “Sorry.” “Is your brain  in gear?” I ask.<br/>\n“Er,” he says, “mostly.”<br/>\n<br/>\n9:20 Daniel is still  sweeping the stairs. Christopher has forgotten what a<br/>\ndirect object is. I  give Emily crayons and paper and trace her hands while I<br/>\nmake up about fifty  short sentences with direct objects and make Christopher<br/>\nidentify them.  “Okay, okay,” he says, after sentence forty-five. “I get it.”<br/>\n<br/>\n9:25 I  explain the passive pluperfect to Christopher. He looks at the forms.<br/>\n“You  have to be kidding,” he says.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:30 Ben emerges, having finished his  chapter, and asks if he can practice<br/>\nhis piano. “What was your chapter  about?” I say. “They went to a place and<br/>\ndid something,” he says. “Go back  and read it again,” I say, “and tell me<br/>\nwhere they went and what they  did.”<br/>\n<br/>\n9:40 Christopher has completed one of his five drill sentences.  Daniel is<br/>\nstill sweeping the steps. Emily announces, “I have to go potty.” I  take her<br/>\ninto the bathroom and sit beside her. Christopher yells, “Help!”  “Try to do<br/>\nit yourself,” I yell back. There is a long silence. When I come  back to the<br/>\nkitchen, he’s on Sentence 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:50 Ben comes back out.  “They went into town and sold WHEAT!” he says<br/>\ntriumphantly. “Good job,” I  say. “Go practice your piano.” I look up the<br/>\nstairs. Daniel is sitting on the  fourth step, sweeping his head with the<br/>\nbrush. “STAIRS,” I say.<br/>\n<br/>\n10 AM  Daniel finishes the stairs. “Go get First Language Lessons,” I say.<br/>\nEmily is  now under the table tickling Christopher’s feet. “Mom,” Christopher<br/>\nsays, “I  can’t think.” He is now on Sentence 3.” I say, “Emily, what are <br/>\nyou<br/>\ndoing?”  “I loving Pipher,” Emily says.<br/>\n<br/>\n10:15 Christopher finishes Sentence 5.  “Okay,” I say. “Good job. That only<br/>\ntook you an hour and ten minutes. Can I  give you a brain massage?” “I think<br/>\nI need some sugar,” he says. I feed  everyone cookies and send Christopher to<br/>\npractice his trumpet. Emily is  bored; I tell Ben to quit practicing his<br/>\npiano and read her a book while I do  Daniel’s grammar. Today, his lesson is<br/>\naction verbs. We repeat, “A verb is a  word that does an action, shows state<br/>\nof being, links two words, or helps  another verb” five times; then I read<br/>\naction verbs while he acts them out.  Ben and Emily abandon their book and<br/>\njoin in. Christopher appears. “I want to  do it too,” he says. Soon they are<br/>\nscreaming, jumping, running, yelling,  falling, wrestling, and singing all<br/>\nover the house. I try, “Whisper! Sleep!  Think!” These are much less popular<br/>\naction verbs.<br/>\n<br/>\n10:30 I send  everyone outside while I drink a cup of coffee. Christopher<br/>\noffers to push  Emily on the swing. While they’re out I look at their school<br/>\nlists;  Christopher still has a massive amount of work to do this morning. I<br/>\ngo  outside too, and Emily and I feed the dogs Milk-Bones through the fence<br/>\nwhile  the boys charge off into the distance.<br/>\n<br/>\n11 AM I yell, “Time to come in!”  Eventually the boys reappear. “Aw,”<br/>\nChristopher says, “we were just getting  going.” “What were you playing?” I<br/>\nask. “Space Age,” he says. “I’m a Space  Age kitty!” Daniel announces.<br/>\nChristopher says, “We had to have Space Age  kitties in the game so Daniel<br/>\ncould play.” Then he stage-whispers, “Ben and I  pretend he’s a Lizardman<br/>\nGeneral, but he thinks he’s a kitty.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n11:10  Christopher goes back to his trumpet. I put Emily back in her chair<br/>\nwith her  crayons. She’s not buying it. “Want to go show Grammy my shoes,”<br/>\nshe says.  “Not right now,” I say. “Ben, go get your grammar.” “Want to show<br/>\nGrammy my  ballerina skirt,” she says. “Not right now,” I say. Small silence.<br/>\n“Want to  show Grammy my belly,” she suggests. “We’ll go see Grammy later,” <br/>\nI<br/>\nsay. I  put on her ballerina skirt and play “Hall of the Mountain King” on<br/>\nthe stereo  while she and Daniel run around the room in circles. Meanwhile I<br/>\ngo through  Ben’s grammar lesson with him; today he’s supposed to diagram<br/>\nsentences from  the Rod & Staff fifth-grade book. His grammar has improved<br/>\nsince we  switched from the A Beka workbooks; he’s a very reluctant writer,<br/>\nbut for  some reason copying out the exercises from the non-consumable Rod &<br/>\nStaff  book has proved easier for him than completing the workbook pages.<br/>\n<br/>\n11:30  Christopher finishes his trumpet and comes back out. “Reading,” I  <br/>\nsay.<br/>\n“Yeah!” Christopher says and disappears again. He’s reading The Once  and<br/>\nFuture King, and has announced that it is his VERY FAVORITE BOOK EVER.  This<br/>\nwarms my heart. I adored this book when I was twelve.<br/>\n<br/>\n11:40 Ben  has done one of his eight sentences. I give him M&Ms. Sugar is a<br/>\nvital  component of the successful home school.<br/>\n<br/>\n11:45 Emily falls over while  skidding around a corner and starts to bellow.<br/>\nI turn off the music, pick her  up, and send Daniel to get his spelling book.<br/>\n<br/>\n12 noon Ben has done two of  his eight sentences. I set the buzzer and tell<br/>\nhim that if he’s not finished  in ten minutes, I’ll give him eight more.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:05 Ben has finished his  grammar lesson. I tell him to play with Emily<br/>\nuntil Dan’s spelling is  finished.<br/>\n<br/>\n12:20 Christopher’s finished reading. I don’t ask him questions  about The<br/>\nOnce and Future King; I clearly remember this book taking me into a  universe<br/>\nso real that I didn’t want to talk about it. Instead I decide to do  history<br/>\nwith everyone simultaneously. I give Emily the math pattern blocks,  which<br/>\nshe pours on the floor and sits on. “These are my eggs,” she says. “I  will<br/>\nhave a baby chicken. Can I go show Grammy my baby chicken?” “Later,” I  say.<br/>\nI tell the boys to get their colored pencils while I clear the table.  We’re<br/>\nstill doing medieval-renaissance history, because (like a lot of  other<br/>\npeople) we’re waiting on publication of Vol. 3 of The Story of the  World. I<br/>\ngive all three boys the map of the Franks and have them color the  three<br/>\nseparate territories while I read aloud. When I get to Clovis I give  them<br/>\nthe coloring page of Clovis’s baptism. “Was he really a  Christian?”<br/>\nChristopher asks. “He promised to become a Christian before he  even knew<br/>\nwhat Christianity was all about,” I say. “Listen.” I reread the  story of the<br/>\nbaptism. “What do you think?” I say. “Nope!” Ben says  cheerfully. “We can’<br/>\nt<br/>\nknow for sure,” I say, “but I think the chances are  against it.” Daniel<br/>\nsays, “Look! He doesn’t have any clothes on in this  picture!”<br/>\n<br/>\n12:40 I put Ben in front of the Usborne Internet-Linked History  Encyclopedia<br/>\nand tell him to read the section on the Franks and write down  the three most<br/>\nimportant things he learns. When I get the Kingfisher History  Encyclopedia<br/>\nout, Christopher groans and says, “Do I have to outline today?”  “You can do<br/>\na composition instead,” I say. “About what?” “Er,” I say,  thinking. “Er, <br/>\nhow<br/>\nabout comparing Clovis to King Arthur?” “That’s a lot,”  Christopher says,<br/>\ndubiously. “You can type it,” I say, “and today you can  make a list of<br/>\ncomparisons, and then actually finish the composition itself  tomorrow.”<br/>\nChristopher agrees and goes off to his room, where he has a  computer (NOT<br/>\nconnected to the Internet). Daniel says, “Can I go play with  Legos?” “Who<br/>\nwas the history lesson about?” I ask. “A guy without clothes,”  he says.<br/>\nEmily announces, “POTTY!” “Okay,” I say, “go play Legos.”<br/>\n<br/>\n1  PM Lunch. Christopher has made a list of comparisons, Ben has written  two<br/>\nsentences. I tell him to write one more before he can eat. While everyone  is<br/>\nstuffing down PBJ and chips, I decide that our diet has too much sugar  and<br/>\nsalt in it and bring out a bag of baby carrots. “Three for everyone!”  I<br/>\nannounce. There; that’ll balance out their diets, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n1:20 PM  It’s rest time. Pete will be back soon to take over school at 3  PM.<br/>\nChristopher hasn’t yet done his grammar or his writing. I pull out his  Rod &<br/>\nStaff book, review the lesson with him, and tell him to finish it  along with<br/>\nhis Wordsmith lesson during rest time, before he does anything  else. I’ll<br/>\ncheck it when he’s finished. Christopher’s independence level  (except for<br/>\nLatin) has rocketed during this past year; I’m beginning to think  that I<br/>\nmight actually survive middle school. I settle Emily down for her  rest, send<br/>\nDaniel to play with Legos (again) and sit down with Ben and his  Prima<br/>\nLatina. Today we’re doing new vocabulary words and new endings. We  talk<br/>\nabout each word and I give him index cards to make new vocabulary  flash<br/>\ncards. “Finish them in your room,” I say, “and then you can listen to  your<br/>\ntape and play.” All of the boys are listening to books on tape  during<br/>\nnaptime; Ben is listening to The Dragonslayers, Daniel to Mrs.  Piggle-Wiggle<br/>\n’s Farm, and Christopher to Cheaper by the Dozen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith  everyone in his room, I sit down to take stock of the morning.<br/>\nChristopher  hasn’t done his logic; he has taken a scunner to Jim Nance,<br/>\nunfortunately,  and I’m about ready to pitch it and try something else. My<br/>\noptions are  limited. Maybe I’ll do the Critical Thinking Press books with<br/>\nhim for a year  and then try to find a tutor. I did Dan’s spelling and<br/>\ngrammar with him, but  I didn’t get to copywork; my mother usually does some<br/>\nhandwriting with him  after his afternooon reading lesson, though, so I’ll<br/>\nask her to fold copywork  into her lesson. Although Daniel is seven, he’s a<br/>\nyoung seven (his birthday  is the last week of October), and we’re hovering<br/>\nbetween first and second  grade work with him. I see that Ben was supposed to<br/>\ndo typing this morning  for me because it’s a heavy math day for Pete, but I<br/>\nforgot. I draw an arrow  on his chart over to Pete’s side of the chart and<br/>\nwrite in, “Typing if you  have time?” Just then Emily yells. I go in her<br/>\nroom. “I had a NIGHTMARE!” she  bellows. “You weren’t asleep,” I tell her. <br/>\nAt<br/>\nthree, Emily doesn’t sleep any  more during rest time; she plays with toys on<br/>\nher floor. “There was a TALKING  BEAN in my closet!” she announces. “It’s a<br/>\nfriendly bean,” I say. “It’s time  to get up,” Emily says. “Not yet,” I <br/>\nsay.<br/>\n“Yes, it is. I have to go see  Grammy and tell her about the talking bean.”<br/>\n“LATER,” I say. When I go back  out I write on Pete’s side of the school<br/>\nchart, “Take Emmy to see Grammy.” I  go upstairs and prop my feet up. In a<br/>\nfew minutes I need to go work on the  grading I blew off first thing this<br/>\nmorning. (Rest time comes first,  though.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111955,"nextTopicId":111972}}
