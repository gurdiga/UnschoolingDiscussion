But BC is always in my mind as where we&#39;ll go if we ever <br/>\nreally get to the point of feeling we have to escape the US!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in most cases here the kids do have a choice about whether to go to <br/>\nschool or not and it&#39;s the kids pressuring each other to go.  What I hear is <br/>\nthat they want a larger social group or they want to &quot;feel normal&quot;.  My kids are <br/>\nonly 9 and 4 and I have learned to be humble about bridges I haven&#39;t crossed <br/>\nwith my kids yet.  But I can&#39;t help but feel that the parents must be sending <br/>\nmessages that school&#39;s the way to go.  Some of the parents are trying to <br/>\nenlarge the homeschooling community for their teens.  But many seem to view high <br/>\nschool as homeschooling families (used to?) view college - well, we <br/>\nhomeschooled, but now we&#39;ll join the rest of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79156,"nextTopicId":79178}}
