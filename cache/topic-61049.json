So I am <br/>\nasking why not? Why not comply with the system, why not play it safe and <br/>\navoid such a conflict? Why take a risk of putting your family through an <br/>\nordeal by the very people I would rather keep out of my life involving my <br/>\nchildren&#39;s whereabouts during the day? I am not questioning you to put you on <br/>\nthe defensive, I am sure this is not a good situation and you need to focus <br/>\nyour energies on it, and I am sympathetic. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n But again, I need to question why you questioned just doing what you were <br/>\nsupposed to do.
