I sent my<br/>\nson<br/>\n&gt; (pre-K and 7 months of K) then learned about ps and started hsing.  I am<br/>\n&gt; wondering how people get the nerve, the info, the empowerment, the<br/>\nawareness,<br/>\n&gt; the ????? to go straight into hsing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, we sort of never sent our child to ps.  We have 10 years between our<br/>\nboys.  The oldest started out in ps (parents were being jailed for not<br/>\nsending their children to ps  when he started school and we simply didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave what it took to join the fight at the time.  I&#39;m VERY grateful to those<br/>\nwho paved the way and due to personal experience really keep an eye on what<br/>\nis happening, watching for need/opportunity to protect or improve homeschool<br/>\nopportunities).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we removed oldest DS mid-8th grade.  He never returned to ps.<br/>\nYoungest son has never attended ps.  He&#39;s 12 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all honesty, watching how much trouble ps caused for our oldest DS and<br/>\nour family has really helped my resolve to not send youngest DS to ps.  Now,<br/>\nany time I consider sending youngest DS to ps, it quickly passes when I<br/>\nthink about all the rigmarole (sp?!) that goes with the package!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has empowered me the very most is to have been a guinea pig of several<br/>\nnew programs in my own ps experiences.  As a child (and adult actually!) we<br/>\nmoved a lot and it seems like every school I attended had some new program<br/>\nor another that they put the new kids into.  Some of them really made school<br/>\nawful for me (things like being in a split grade class so I was doing<br/>\nadvanced work one year and then having to repeat the same work the following<br/>\nyear because they didn&#39;t have any place else to put me or any other work to<br/>\ndo and this is what students this age are required to cover...grrr...hate<br/>\nthat sort by age business).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always wanted to homeschool my children from before I even knew who I<br/>\nwould marry.  I was crushed when DS was school age and local parents were<br/>\ngoing to jail!  DH was in the military in Nebraska and if we had defied the<br/>\nlocal school district DH would have been looking at doing Federal Military<br/>\ntime.  It was simply too much for us to fight at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I&#39;m surprised that once we made the decision, I had lots of angst<br/>\nover the how&#39;s and what if&#39;s.  Seems pretty silly now, but I do remember how<br/>\nscary is was to consider teaching my child to read and do math and WHAT IF<br/>\nHE DIDN&#39;T LEARN!?  What if he was never socialized!?  (Don&#39;t make me laugh!<br/>\nWhat silliness...yet at the time it was a very real concern.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to empowerment....while worrying about which teaching style would help<br/>\nyoungest DS learn to read and doing lots of research on one plan and another<br/>\nlooking for the perfect solution, I realized that nobody writing any book<br/>\nknows my son like I do!  No one else can say with any certainty what will<br/>\nwork for my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the key (at least it was for me)...all the &#39;new and improved&#39;<br/>\nprograms are just a bunch of experiments with our children as the guinea<br/>\npigs!  The educrats don&#39;t know any more about how to reach and teach my son<br/>\nthan I do...in fact I know more because I know HIM.  Well, if the<br/>\nestablishment is just conducting experiments...then he might as well stay at<br/>\nhome with me and we can conduct our own experiment and see how well he does!<br/>\nI&#39;m just as qualified to make decisions for my child as any one else.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, that&#39;s how I started out thinking...now I realize I&#39;m MORE<br/>\nQUALIFIED than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I got past finding the &#39;right&#39; way to teach and share with my child and<br/>\nwe just got down to the business of enjoying our time and lives together it<br/>\nhas been a grand experience!  I&#39;m amazed at the things he learns from our<br/>\nevery day activities and thrilled at the things I learn with him.  (That was<br/>\nalso an important thing to learn...if I don&#39;t know something DS wants/needs<br/>\nto learn, it&#39;s no problem.  I just learn along with him or help him find an<br/>\noutside resource!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to rub shoulders (or keyboards, as the case may be) with others who<br/>\nare on similar journeys.  Sometimes I&#39;ll see a theory or idea another family<br/>\nis using and think &#39;you know what, that just might help our family&#39;.  Other<br/>\ntimes I&#39;ll hear something and know there is no way that is gonna work in our<br/>\nhome.  It really doesn&#39;t take long to gain confidence in your ability to<br/>\nfind the answers that are right for your family.  Even better yet, those<br/>\nthings that don&#39;t work are not likely to cause irreparable damage and the<br/>\nthings that do work will bring great joy!  How&#39;s that for a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it helps!<br/>\nEiraul<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brownville77@...\">Brownville77@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21532,"nextTopicId":21603}}
