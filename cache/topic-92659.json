Cohen most <br/>\ndefinitely advocates exploring feelings of all sorts in play and <br/>\nadvises parents to play in order to understand what their kids are <br/>\nfeeling and to help them work through issues, if/when they have them. <br/>\nSo if another child was mean to your child at the playground, your <br/>\nchild might come home and start hitting dolls. Instead of, as Leo <br/>\nsuggested, saying that it wasn&#39;t a good thing to do, you&#39;d play <br/>\nthrough various scenarios, maybe pretending to be the mean doll or <br/>\nthe doll that was sad--wherever the child led. Let them speak and you <br/>\nmay find that they are afraid of someone else&#39;s violence, or sad <br/>\nabout something that happened or who knows. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes pointing a toy/pretend gun isn&#39;t aggressive or violent <br/>\nplay. My son learned to do it because the other kids were doing it <br/>\nand thinks it&#39;s something fun. Instead of pushing him away telling <br/>\nhim he&#39;s doing something wrong, make a connection by starting a game. <br/>\nCohen also suggests that parents act out dramatic death scenes <br/>\nif &quot;shot&quot;, so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s advocating suppressing, just giving <br/>\nan alternative, esp. to parents who aren&#39;t comfortable with pretend <br/>\nguns being pointed at them. Playing instead of lecturing, yippee!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son starts to understand that &quot;shooters&quot; are supposed to hurt <br/>\npeople, I&#39;ll play along at times and I&#39;ll answer the questions he has <br/>\nabout people getting hurt. I also might try to play &#39;love gun&#39; <br/>\nsometimes. Or he might want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying to be brief and kinda left out the point!
