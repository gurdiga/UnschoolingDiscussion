Wont you know it B & <br/>\nN did not have any, not even the extra teach your own that I had asked that <br/>\nthey get. Gesh!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I placed another order and will wait the two weeks (they say 3-5 but its <br/>\nbeen almost 2 weeks a couple times now).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I came home I looked at my receipt and was thrilled and guilt ridden at <br/>\nthe same time. The lady at the capachino stand (mind blank on the name of the <br/>\ncoffee) took the<br/>\n on-hold paper off my book but never scanned it!  Could be me but I thought <br/>\nthere was something strange about the transaction.  <br/>\nWas this an accident? <br/>\nDid we look poor? (My kids are very well dressed, I am in jeans and sneakers <br/>\nbut they are clean and always a Polo) I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\nDid she know we where HS/Unschoolers? Was she Homeschooled?<br/>\nDoes she hate her job?<br/>\nDid she just miss it?<br/>\nMy gosh I am driving my self nuts. I keep thinking when we left the store we <br/>\ncould have been accused of shoplifting. UGH!<br/>\n&quot;ATTENTION B & N CUSTOMERS&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Homeschool Mother lifts book at B & N while shopping with her three <br/>\nchildren&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going back there tomorrow but when my other book come in I will give <br/>\nthem the money. <br/>\nStrange thing is my husband came home and told me his cruel boss is doing pay <br/>\ncuts on the bonus program again to the toll of -1000.00 a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoincidence?
