We have two young boys and this is<br/>\nthe<br/>\nsecond year we are homeschooling the 6 year old.  Last year we were<br/>\npretty casual. Well for some reason this year I decided to buy a<br/>\nboxed<br/>\ncurriculum. It is going OK.  He really likes the math and I am<br/>\nletting<br/>\nhim go at his own rate.  But it is the reading that is bothering me.<br/>\nHe is learing to read OK, but it isn&#39;t his favorite.  He is reading<br/>\nthe<br/>\nbooks that came with the curriculum until the present one.  He says<br/>\nhe<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to read it. So then I said to myself, &quot;I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake him read a book he doesn&#39;t want to read&quot;.  But he isn&#39;t really<br/>\ninterested in reading other books on his own either.  We go to the<br/>\nlibrary a lot and he checks out books on subjects that he is<br/>\ninterested<br/>\nin.  Like right now it is hockey.  But they are all adult books, he<br/>\njust looks at the pictures.  Which I think is great, but he has no<br/>\ninterest in learning to read them.  The main problem is my husband,<br/>\nhe<br/>\nwants me to teach him to read and write!  So has anyone been in my<br/>\nsituation?  Being more relaxed than your significant other?  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to force my son to read and turn him off of it.  I am just now<br/>\nrelearning to enjoy reading myself and I want to make sure my son<br/>\nloves<br/>\nto read.  But I also need to keep my husband satisfied.  If I tell<br/>\nhim,&quot; Oh he will pick it up in a few years, he will be OK&quot;.  He won&#39;t<br/>\nlike that.  Well Sorry to make this so long!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 21 Nov 2001 16:47:49 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Kathy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurawilder82@...\">laurawilder82@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: What we say to anyone who criticizes our values<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Lovemary,<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the added thoughs.

Just a start of a new thought, what do you all<br/>\n&gt;  think?<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with this. I have found many people who get very defensive when I<br/>\nsay<br/>\n&gt; we homeschool, as if they see an implied criticism of their schooling<br/>\nchoice<br/>\n&gt; (which is usually public school.) Interestingly, it is the folks whose<br/>\nkids<br/>\n&gt; are in public school, not private or charter, that seem the most<br/>\ndefensive.<br/>\n&gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt; Amy Kagey in NW Ohio<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds similar to my experience. I also have run into many public<br/>\nschool folks who say they could never homeschool, and then proceed to<br/>\ncomplain about how much trouble their school is. How their child is<br/>\nmiserable, how unfair the teacher or other kids are, how stifling, on<br/>\nand on. They say they could never homeschool because (choose one or all<br/>\nof the following:) they&#39;re not organized enough, coundn&#39;t work that<br/>\nhard, that they don&#39;t know enough, that the kids need socializing, or<br/>\n(the saddest &quot;reason&quot; of all) that they couldn&#39;t stand being around<br/>\ntheir kids that much. I do mention that I am not really that organized,<br/>\nand that I find unschooling much easier that fighting a system. Mostly<br/>\nI just say that the real beauty of homeschooling is that you can work<br/>\nit out to fit your own families needs, and do what&#39;s best the way you<br/>\nsee it. Change things around to use what works and throw out what<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s so flexible, and very individual. Sometimes I get in<br/>\na word about a new version of socialization too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many people are afraid of the idea that they alone would be<br/>\nresponsible for teaching their kids everything. I tell them it dosn&#39;t<br/>\nreally have to be like that. I am learning with my kids, and they are<br/>\npart of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 18<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 21 Nov 2001 09:41:49 -0800<br/>\n   From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Topics From Dateline<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else watch Dateline last night?

And a dozen other things but I<br/>\nblanked half of them out I was so floored by it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Since they made a few references to homeschooling these children, how<br/>\nsoon before we get some backlash from the media over the grinning fool<br/>\ntalking about &quot;the Bible says &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;&quot; as an excuse<br/>\nfor using a switch on toddlers when asked about discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) And, speaking of controlling parents and potty training, anyone else<br/>\nnotice mommy dearest thunk the little boy back on the potty chair when he<br/>\ngot up to leave it?<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 19<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 21 Nov 2001 17:53:44 -0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Bridget&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: letting go<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., curtkar@h... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Do you think I&#39;m making the right decision?<br/>\n&gt; This act is a big deal for me.<br/>\n&gt; If they like meat, they won&#39;t be vegetarians any more, like I am.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m willing to accept that, though.<br/>\n&gt; I guess we&#39;ll just see what happens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Karin<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Karin,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think you are making a good decision.
