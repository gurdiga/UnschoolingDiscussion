That&#39;s<br/>\njust my humble opinion and I think that we all have to<br/>\nanswer to God on and induvidual and very personal<br/>\nbasis when it comes down to it, so as long as you are<br/>\nattempting to live your life in a way that will please<br/>\nhim and as long as you are really doing what you<br/>\nBElIEVE ..and that applies to pagan, agnostic,<br/>\ncatholic, buddhist, taoist, etc, etc, etc...cuz that<br/>\nis your BELIEF system, and as long as you really<br/>\nbelieve it in your heart and not for a superficial<br/>\nreason and you really know what you believe and try to<br/>\nkeep growing and learning and not judge others (cuz<br/>\nthat&#39;s not our place, as humans, in my opinion) than<br/>\nit&#39;s on you. So what if someone else doesn&#39;t agree,<br/>\nthen that&#39;s on them. Between them and God. ...(or<br/>\nwhatever you would like to put there). That&#39;s all, I<br/>\nmust stop myself compulsive rambling. <br/>\n<br/>\nAND I would also like to say that this list has proven<br/>\nso very open-minded and kind and civil with the<br/>\ndiscussion of things like this, lately. I love it. I<br/>\njust adore this list and all we can gain from it. <br/>\nThanks everyone for sharing, and doing so in a nice<br/>\nloving way. <br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lynda &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is a segment of Christian society that has<br/>\n&gt; determined that only some<br/>\n&gt; religions get to be under the umbrella of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Christian.&quot;  That was all<br/>\n&gt; explained, I think on this list about a year or so<br/>\n&gt; ago (but it could have<br/>\n&gt; been on HEM) by a fundy (he called himself a fundy,<br/>\n&gt; so don&#39;t anyone get<br/>\n&gt; their bloomers in a bunch, besides which, he is a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;good&quot; fundy &lt;g&gt;) who was<br/>\n&gt; a list member.

Many protestants (but NOT all) feel <br/>\nthat catholics are not &quot;real&quot; Christians because of many of the teachings of <br/>\nthe Church. It might also be said that many Catholics do not believe that <br/>\nprotestants are Christians (maybe that&#39;s not right, maybe it&#39;s that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t think that they will go to heaven, I&#39;m not sure which terminology to <br/>\nuse) because they do not belong to the &quot;true&quot; religion. (As evidenced just <br/>\nrecently when a friend of mine married an Italian Catholic and could not be <br/>\nmarried in his parent&#39;s church because she is not catholic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the reason that I stuck my nose in is that much like I sometimes <br/>\nfeel the need to defend un-schooling, I sometimes feel the need to defend <br/>\nChristianity (in this case, protestant Christianity).

Liberal <br/>\nChristianity does not believe Jesus was divine, not that he was <br/>\nphysically resurrected, and believes that, rather than Jesus being <br/>\nan atonement, he came to show us a pattern of how to live, and <br/>\nthat living that life is what counts.  Liberal Christianity is also <br/>\nbasically unitarian, in that they believe everyone will go to heaven, <br/>\nbecause we are all God&#39;s children and he loves us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI USED to be one of the fundamentalist kind, but have recently, as <br/>\na result of a lot of study, become one of the liberal kind.  It just <br/>\nmakes so much more sense, and is a much less judgmental way <br/>\nto live.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, everyone is entitled to be whichever they want.
