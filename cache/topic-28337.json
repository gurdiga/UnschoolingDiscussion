The saddest thing about this society to me is that<br/>\n&gt; so few adults do work they really believe in, and that contributes to<br/>\n&gt; positive change, rather than just something to make a living.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How can teenagers not be upset to look around and see that this is true?<br/>\n&gt; They are bombarded by urgent messages from the media about all that is<br/>\n&gt; terrible in the world, and then they look around and see that their own<br/>\n&gt; parents are doing nothing to change anything. If the kids are asked to help<br/>\n&gt; at all, its in the form of penny drives (not to knock the charity, but it<br/>\n&gt; doesnt tend to get at the roots of big problems). If you were a teen,<br/>\n&gt; wouldnt all this make you feel like snapping and carping at your parents,<br/>\n&gt; rebelling and picking fights over nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the problems many teens have in our society are due to<br/>\necological issues, they&#39;re due to not having good choices of things to do<br/>\nwith their lives. And by good things, I mean good for each individual teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nA teen will FIND somewhere to focus all that energy and burgeoning<br/>\nadulthood. Some may choose to focus on things that will harm them or others,<br/>\nbut mostly because the teen in question HAD no good choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven options to do what they love, some will turn to environmentalism, and<br/>\nsome will turn to horse training, and some will turn to the stock market,<br/>\nand some will turn to ice skating competition, and some will turn to<br/>\nbasketball, some will turn to bicycle repair, some to writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe right to choose is everything. The assumption that they are capable and<br/>\nintelligent and important to their family, AND to the groups of people they<br/>\nchoose to be around (whether the basketball team, the stable, the stock<br/>\ngroup, the rink, or, yes, the street gang) is everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28652,"nextTopicId":28413}}
