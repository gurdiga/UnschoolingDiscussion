You will find quotes,  research articles,<br/>\nspeeches by Paul Wellstone, Jonathan Kozol, Alfie Kohn,  and a great deal<br/>\nmore.<br/>\nFeatured on the website is a protest against the tests that will be held in<br/>\nPalisades, NY.  All are welcome to attend, and Bill Wetzel can send out<br/>\ninformation packets to those people, groups, or schools who would like to<br/>\nattend.  Here is a short description from the site:<br/>\n&quot;On October 9th, Students Against Testing will be joining hands with<br/>\nactivists all around the Northeast to make our voices known at the 2001<br/>\nNational Education Summit in Palisades, NY. The summit is an exclusive,<br/>\ninvitation-only meeting attended by presidents, governors, business<br/>\nexecutives, state superintendents, and media -- with no principals or<br/>\nteachers invited. The single focus of the gathering is to expand<br/>\n&#39;standards-based education&#39; as widely and quickly as possible -- which<br/>\ntranslates into more time and energy focused on<br/>\nstandardized testing and less on real learning in classrooms across the<br/>\nnation. Standardized testing has, time and again, proven to be an<br/>\nineffective and mind-numbing way of &#39;educating&#39; today&#39;s  youth.&quot;<br/>\nFor more information, email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:billw@...\">billw@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24744,"nextTopicId":24757}}
