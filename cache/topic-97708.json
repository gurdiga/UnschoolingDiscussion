I<br/>\nthink that babies benefit hugely, as do fathers and families, when the<br/>\nfather is just as involved in child rearing and care as the mom. That means<br/>\nthe dad taking care of and bonding with the baby, carrying and cosleeping,<br/>\nskin to skin contact--none of which precludes the mom nursing and practicing<br/>\nall of these things as well. Babies benefit hugely from a close relationship<br/>\nwith both parents, and I think this kind of relationship makes dad a kinder,<br/>\ngentler parent in the long run. You&#39;re right that I think the mom is<br/>\nparamount, but I think the dads are far more important than they&#39;ve<br/>\ngenerally been.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were in grad school, dh used to care for the babies while I was<br/>\nteaching and doing office hours. This was one to two hour stretches, in<br/>\nbetween nursings, either at home or in his lab. He helped deliver them,<br/>\ncarried them, nurtured and cared for them in a far more active way than most<br/>\nfathers, even though he never got to give them a bottle. Attachment<br/>\nparenting works best, in my opinion, when both parents practice it, which<br/>\nrequires more physical presence from fathers than most jobs allow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m looking for shorter work weeks, more vacation time, flexible hours<br/>\nfor BOTH parents, enabling families to be TOGETHER more and both parents to<br/>\nbe primary caregivers. I&#39;m looking for families to come first in real life,<br/>\nnot just in empty political rhetoric that furthers a particular corporate<br/>\nagenda that ultimately undermines real families.<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Paternity leave is no longer a fantasy or a joke.<br/>\n&gt; Personal time, same.<br/>\n&gt; Family counselling benefits (to prevent divorce it seemed, three emergency<br/>\n&gt; counselling visits) were one of the benefits Keith had when he went to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>work for<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sperry before Kirby was born.

The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was a huge<br/>\nstep in the right direction, though there are still lots of loopholes and<br/>\nshortfalls.** Compared to countries like Sweden, however, America lags far<br/>\nbehind--just google it. Sweden offers 18 months of parental leave at 80%<br/>\nsalary, and another source cites up to 96 weeks. Australia and New Zealand<br/>\noffer up to 52 weeks, Canada and Denmark 50 weeks, Italy 47, Finland 44, UK<br/>\n40 (not clear what pay percentage). America offers 6 weeks paid leave and up<br/>\nto 6 months, or 24 weeks, unpaid at some companies; the FMLA only offers 12<br/>\nweeks UNPAID and that only in certain circumstances.** In France every<br/>\nsingle worker is guaranteed 5 weeks vacation every year, and the country<br/>\neven subsidizes vacations for low income families so they get to go<br/>\nsomewhere. In America most workers get 2 weeks vacation a year, many of whom<br/>\ncan&#39;t even schedule the time off because they&#39;re too busy or they&#39;ve used it<br/>\nup staying at home with sick children or covering for daycare closings.<br/>\nThat&#39;s not even touching upon the health care issue and how many families,<br/>\nor even just children, are uninsured and without access to basic medical and<br/>\npreventative care. Yes, things are changing, but they still have a ways to<br/>\ngo for families.<br/>\n<br/>\n==<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Since the 60&#39;s, cottage industry has been making a comeback, though (at<br/>\n </span></blockquote>least<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; where I am).

That&#39;s why I think Daniel Pink&#39;s book<br/>\n_Free Agent Nation_ is so fascinating and so important. As workers retake<br/>\ncontrol over their own labor, they are retaking control over their families<br/>\nas well, which is why writing that book led Pink to discover homeschooling<br/>\ngenerally and unschooling in particular. In his speech at a recent Maryland<br/>\nhomeschooler&#39;s conference, he specifically stated that what he is really<br/>\ncalling free agent education is UNschooling, not homeschooling. I think<br/>\nAmerica is inching in the right direction, and I really feel that<br/>\nunschoolers are on the cutting edge of that change. I&#39;m excited, energized<br/>\nand optimistic about the possibilities unschooling has to offer--I think we<br/>\nare living a big part of the change.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**Many employers are required by federal law to allow their employees (both<br/>\nmen and women) 12 weeks of unpaid family leave after the birth or adoption<br/>\nof a child under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).

In this case, your employer isn&#39;t required to keep your<br/>\njob open for you. Another exception is if you and your partner both work for<br/>\nthe same company. In this case, you&#39;re only entitled to a combined 12 weeks<br/>\nof parental leave between the two of you.

Sperry became Honeywell, benefits change from <br/>\ntime to time, but they seem family oriented to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings are changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the current, August 9, Newsweek, Anna Quindlen has a wonderful column <br/>\nabout how liberalism has chnaged the country.  It&#39;s worth reading.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nif they put those online or not.   <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We liberals have been shamed into thinking our vision failed, when in fact <br/>\nit has simply been absorbed ito the national self-potrait.  From the idea that <br/>\na woman ought to have the same legal rights as her male counterparts to the <br/>\nbelief that workers should count on being safe from hazardous conditions, <br/>\nformerly liberal principles have become bedrock democracy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAround 1985 a young female friend of ours came over for help on an essay for <br/>\ncollege.  She had a list of options, and one was to tell how feminism helped <br/>\nher life, or how it had not.  She was going to write about how the feminist <br/>\nmovement had had no effect on her life.    Keith, who had not long before that <br/>\nbeen a sexist pigboy from a family of all boys in a military/redneck town didn&#39;t <br/>\neven glance at me before saying, &quot;What!?  You need to write how it DID make <br/>\nyour life better.&quot;   And he went on sensibly about her being at the university, <br/>\nnot being pressured to marry, not being limited to nursing or elementary <br/>\neducation, and so forth.    She wrote the pro-feminism essay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone several years ago came into a discussion like this one (AOL days I <br/>\nthink) and said the 60&#39;s were dead and had had no effect.   How nutso.  How <br/>\nblind.   People can buy health food easily in most parts of the country.   I&#39;m one <br/>\nmile from a Keller&#39;s farm store, which pre-dates the hippies and sells <br/>\norganic meats (and other cool stuff), less than a quarter mile from a Wild Oats and <br/>\na Keva Juice in the same little mall, across the street from an Ayurvedic <br/>\nmedicine teaching facility, two blocks from an Ayurvedic vegan restaurant.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s a shop across the main road from my house (a few hundred yards) that sells <br/>\nsupplies for wiccans, and nobody has so much as egged their windows.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople wear their hair short or long as they wish, with little flak or <br/>\npressure.   Boys (and men) wear beards if they want to, and don&#39;t if they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto.   Girls (and women) can wear long skirts, short skirts, or pants.  They <br/>\ncan dress like boys if they want to, and few people say a word.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry that in the 50s.<br/>\nTry that in the 60s!   <br/>\n<br/>\nLate 60s, young men with long hair were in danger of being held down by <br/>\nrednecks and shaved.  Young women who dared to wear mini-skirt or to go braless had <br/>\nthat brought up in court, if she were molested, as evidence that she had <br/>\n&quot;asked for it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTry THAT in the early 21st century, and be laughed out of the legal <br/>\nprofession.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen change comes that steadily and solidly, it hardly shows, but by looking <br/>\nback forty or fifty years you see the huge speed at which things changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97822,"nextTopicId":97815}}
