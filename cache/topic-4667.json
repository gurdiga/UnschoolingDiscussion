She will do real life math almost always. At the<br/>\ngrocery store, I ask her, &quot;This item is $1.99, and I have a coupon for<br/>\n$.35, which the store will double. What will be the final price I pay?&quot;<br/>\n(Soon, I&#39;ll start asking her to figure the tax, too.) At the printer, &quot;I<br/>\nmade 27 copies, at $.05 each. What do we pay?&quot; I tell her to write it on<br/>\nthe form, too. <br/>\n\tFractions, we do by doubling the muffin recipe, divvying up the pizza,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n\tWe also began going to a &quot;Fun With Real Math&quot; club, which uses a lot of<br/>\nmaterial from &quot;Family Math.&quot; She is enjoying it very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Shay<br/>\n<br/>\nFOLC eclectic homeschool support group <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/page/folcfolks\">http://expage.com/page/folcfolks</a><br/>\nVaEclecticHomeschool discussion list<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/VaEclecticHomeschool\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/VaEclecticHomeschool</a><br/>\nVirginia Homeschoolers: join VHEA<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.people.virginia.edu/~pm6f/vhea.html\">http://www.people.virginia.edu/~pm6f/vhea.html</a><br/>\nAll homeschoolers: join the National Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org\">http://www.nhen.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4643,"nextTopicId":4657}}
