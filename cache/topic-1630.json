I bounce the ideas off of the boys, and they do what they like.  <br/>\nmany of the &quot;concepts&quot; can be done with a simple conversation at the dinner <br/>\ntable, then if the boys are interested, we keep going, if not, we move on.  <br/>\nIt is incredible the ideas and things that can be learned through the Thomas <br/>\nEdison guide, plenty of cool stuff to learn about.  if we were going by the <br/>\nbook on this unit, it would easily keep us busy for 17 weeks!!!!  But we are <br/>\nreally just getting to know Tom and the some of the cool ideas he came up <br/>\nwith while expanding on those ideas and reaching out into the world to grasp <br/>\nas much good stuff as time allows (and that really ins&#39;t much with swimming, <br/>\nbaseball, visits with friends and families, sitting under a tree and drawing, <br/>\nobserving bugs, playing nintendo, running here and there to see this and <br/>\nthat).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 3 volumes of Beyond 5 in A Row.
