I was just<br/>\nputting 3yo. dd to bed and when I took off her pants to put her pull-up on I<br/>\nnoticed she had on 2 pair of pants. When I asked her why she said it was<br/>\nbecause she wanted to look cute and cool at the same time. Well 7yo. dd and<br/>\nI burst out laughing and then she added to the humor by telling 3yo. that<br/>\ncute and cool together made cuticool (as opposed to cuticle). Sorry, I&#39;m<br/>\njust having one of those, I&#39;m gushing because my kids are so cute moments.<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7499,"nextTopicId":7924}}
