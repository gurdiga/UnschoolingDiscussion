I developed a horrible abscess on my liver where the <br/>\nsurgeon retracted it to get to my stomach. It took almost two weeks for <br/>\nanyone <br/>\nto catch it and by then the infection had spread so bad that my lungs <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwork and my blood oxygen levels were sating at barely 80%. My heart was <br/>\nworking so hard that I had a small heart attack. But I am finally better now <br/>\nand <br/>\nhave lost over 80 pounds in the past few months! AND Darin and I are <br/>\n*thinking* <br/>\nabout maybe another baby in the next year or so, we are just worried about <br/>\nthe <br/>\nage gap between a baby and Moly and Jack.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you survived!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope the kids weren&#39;t too afraid and that you were still able to be with <br/>\nthem.  VERY scary story.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly still seems not to have fully recovered from the two months I was laid <br/>\nup with a broken leg.   She missed having me be able to tuck her in (or even <br/>\nsee her room, for two months, because I couldn&#39;t get up the stairs, and she had <br/>\nmoved in there not long before that).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard, when people are committed to attachment parenting or unschooling <br/>\nand then become unable to move through the house and take kids places the way <br/>\nthey would like to be able to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you&#39;re back, Nancy.  I missed your writings!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91719,"nextTopicId":91717}}
