My father wanted to name me Jessica Catherine and as far as he knew <br/>\nthats what my name would be.  Well my Mother was mad at my father for <br/>\ngetting her pregnant as she didn&#39;t want me in the first place so she decided <br/>\nat the last minute to name me Bridget (because my father didn&#39;t like the <br/>\nname) and  Mary (because she was supposedly Catholic at the time) Apparently <br/>\nshe also thought that having the initials B.M. or B.S. (my maiden name is <br/>\nSchwaderer) would be a cute way of getting back at my father too.  After <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t want my name anymore so I changed it to Holly because I liked <br/>\nit and my friends said that the name Holly suited me better anyway.   <br/>\nHowever, now that I go by Holly I kind of feel like a fake using that name <br/>\nsometimes and wonder If I overreacted to my biological mothers hurtful <br/>\ncomments by changing my name.

I look <br/>\nforeward to hearing more about all of you in the coming months on this list.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Michelle Harper&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmagik@...\">earthmagik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Meeting new people..Fill in the <br/>\n&gt;blanks...Please.<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 8 Jun 2000 18:38:59 -0500<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;HI All!!   I just thought it would be a good idea to do some sort of intro, <br/>\n&gt;which we may have already done. I get kinda confused on who&#39;s who.  And <br/>\n&gt;since we have so many new people everyday, it would be nice to know more <br/>\n&gt;about them.  So I&#39;ve listed a few categories, and filled my answers in <br/>\n&gt;myself, so we can all get to know each other better.  This would be very <br/>\n&gt;helpful to me, to get to know people better.  Thanks.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Why do you un/home school?  I un/homeschool because I want the best  for my <br/>\n&gt;child. I believe he is a unique, and wonderful individual who has the right <br/>\n&gt;to learn at his own pace, and cultivate the skills that are inherent in him <br/>\n&gt;naturally.  So that when he grows up he may choose a labour of love, that <br/>\n&gt;best suits him, and that he will consider to be his life work, rather than <br/>\n&gt;serve his community in a position that does not encourage his spirit to be <br/>\n&gt;whole.  The public school system does not offer the means to achieve this <br/>\n&gt;goal.  His emotional, spiritual, mental, and educational health depends on <br/>\n&gt;his freedom to choose his own path of learning, and I am here to provide <br/>\n&gt;him with the resources to cultivate his dreams, so he can make them come <br/>\n&gt;true(we can go on forever with this one , eh&#39;?)<br/>\n&gt;How many children do you have, how old, and names(if you wish)?  1 son, 4 <br/>\n&gt;almost 5, Zain<br/>\n&gt;What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Math concepts, through <br/>\n&gt;asking various, and many people&quot;How old are you?&quot;, and many follow-up <br/>\n&gt;questions, He is comparing and figuring in his head........Magicians,,we <br/>\n&gt;read book last night about magicians, and he was real interested, so for <br/>\n&gt;his birthday next month , I&#39;ve just arranged to have a real magician come, <br/>\n&gt;doves, wands, and all...WHAT fun! Pajama Sam games, and carrying little <br/>\n&gt;gadgets in his pockets for saving the day.  (his favorite clothes are the <br/>\n&gt;ones with many pockets)<br/>\n&gt;WHat area does your family live in?  The Pacific Northwest, a beautiful <br/>\n&gt;green, lush area.<br/>\n&gt;Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  I need to <br/>\n&gt;know more about them,  but as I have not run into any peroblems yet, I am <br/>\n&gt;satisfied at this point.<br/>\n&gt;DO you have any pets?   yes, 3 dogs  Bart, Cucca, & cedar   a wolf hybrid,a <br/>\n&gt;sharpei, and a mix of the two    2 cats, Zalia, & Grandma  2 birds, finches <br/>\n&gt;  Fred & wilma, and 3 fish<br/>\n&gt;ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  We are avid plant and tree lovers..we <br/>\n&gt;own a small Tree company, and I am a wildcrafter, and study <br/>\n&gt;herbalism.....My honey is Dana, and I am Michelle..sometimes called <br/>\n&gt;Snakefootwoman(my given name) We love Nature, Sweatlodge, and have a deep <br/>\n&gt;connection with SPIRIT.

He <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in reading and has just started reading some books on his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;own.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mara doesn&#39;t really have any outstanding interests at this time.  <br/>\n&gt;She<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likes board games and animals.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WHat area does your family live in?

We have decided to un/homeschool because of all <br/>\nthe reasons already mentioned.  Both my hubby and I feel that we would have <br/>\nbeen better off homeschooled.  We both were extremely bored in school which <br/>\nled my hubby into a lot of trouble.  I would have loved to be given the <br/>\nfreedom to learn at my own pace.  I believe I would have been much happier <br/>\nand not felt so stupid.  I don&#39;t want that for our children.  I want them to <br/>\nlearn because they love it.  As I finally do now.<br/>\n <br/>\n How many children do you have, how old, and names?  2 children, 1 daughter <br/>\nAlexis, a.k.a. Ali, who is three and one son Matthew who is 1<br/>\n <br/>\n What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Matthew loves buttons, <br/>\nknob, doors, holes and anything that goes in them.  He is into pulling things <br/>\nbehind himself, including a hand held massager (by the cord, no less), which <br/>\nis his favorite.  Ali has discover a seris of phonics books called Word Bird, <br/>\nwhich she loves.  I think she is starting to decode our language, some.  So <br/>\nwe have been reading tons of those.  She loves the outdoors, but we live in <br/>\nan apt. so we have little space to run and be free.  The next move is for <br/>\nmore outdoor space!<br/>\n <br/>\n WHat area does your family live in?  The Southheast.<br/>\n <br/>\n Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nthat much about them, yet.  I am still overcoming my fears that they will <br/>\nlearn what they need to when they need it.  That is why I am starting early.  <br/>\nhee hee  While my heart believes this theory, my head is lagging behind.<br/>\n <br/>\n DO you have any pets?   yes, 1 cats, one dog <br/>\n <br/>\n ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  My little ones and I are very involved in <br/>\nvolunteering for La Leche League and we are getting ready to start an <br/>\nAttachment Parenting group in the town we just moved to. Both my hubby and I <br/>\nare new to natural living but we are getting there.  Right after our move, we <br/>\nget stuck in a tv rut,  so now we are battling out of that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell better run, we are off to pick blueberries this morning.<br/>\nchat later<br/>\nHappy Mothering,<br/>\nJulie <br/>\nMommy to Ali and Matthew, Wife to a Great Man, Adam<br/>\nPlease check out a few of my  favorite sites:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com\">http://www.mothering.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.AttachmentParenting.org\">http://www.AttachmentParenting.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LaLecheLeague.org\">http://www.LaLecheLeague.org</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org\">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>\n&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>\nbeing kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>\n-Peggy O&#39;Mara, Publisher of Mothering Magazine.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jaam1224@cs.com","from":"Jaam1224@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lZB1xSvJKiSg2nwt7sD0oTL5H7A1WiF4qm5b0A8Lk4Xi92Tsr-HzRhM_mZKApCWYAHvOXVoX","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Meeting new people..Fill in the blanks...Please.","postDate":"960546953","msgId":9054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwLjU3MmI5ZjIuMjY3MjIyODlAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9052,"nextInTopic":9055,"prevInTime":9053,"nextInTime":9055,"topicId":9052,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/8/00 11:05:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time, bonniepainter@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1108878892\">In a message dated 6/8/00 11:05:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonniepainter@...\">bonniepainter@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;   &quot;Mom, when I was inside you, I <br/>\n could see everything there.&quot;  Dad then proceeded to ask if he could see my <br/>\n heart.  &quot;Oh, yes.

We have decided to un/homeschool because our <br/>\nchildren are very bright, articulate, and creative.  I do not want that <br/>\ntaken away from them by someone telling them that their individualism <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter, what society wants them to be is much more important.  They <br/>\nmust be like everyone else! (YECK)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many children do you have, how old, and names?  2 children, 1 son Mac <br/>\nwho is 5 and one daughter Mara who is 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Well, Mac has been <br/>\ninterested in trains since he was 18 months old.  That is still ongoing.  <br/>\nHowever, he has added skyscrapers and bridges to his interests.  He is also <br/>\ninterested in reading and has just started reading some books on his own.  <br/>\nMara doesn&#39;t really have any outstanding interests at this time.  She really <br/>\nlikes board games and animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHat area does your family live in?  The Northeast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDO you have any pets?   yes, 5 cats, one dog and 2 fish<br/>\n<br/>\nANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  We also are very spiritual.  We are very <br/>\nactive members of our Unitarian Universalist church.  I have to add <br/>\nsomething that my son said to me today, as I felt that it was the most <br/>\nwonderful thing anyone has every said to me.  &quot;Mom, when I was inside you, I <br/>\ncould see everything there.&quot;  Dad then proceeded to ask if he could see my <br/>\nheart.  &quot;Oh, yes.
