It&#39;s all in the way someone says the word.  <br/>\nIf its a project, the normal, correct way to ennunicate and pronounce the <br/>\nword, then its just a personal something you working on at your own leisure.   My <br/>\nkids have several projects going all the time.  A Lego city, a poster they <br/>\nare coloring, an concoction in a jar, raising puppies, etc etc.   JP might say.. <br/>\nI just added a new building to my lego project.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if someone is talking about  a school project.. It becomes a Pro-JECT.  <br/>\nWith the emphasis clearly on the JECT.   It&#39;s just like when the clerk at <br/>\nWal-mart comes on the intercom and calles for the RE-turns.&quot;aisle 5, come to the <br/>\nfront for your RE-turns&quot;  LOL, I could die laughing.  Or when someone is being <br/>\nderogatory and says RE-tard.    If the emphasis is on the wrong syllable , <br/>\nit&#39;s probably not a good thing.. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72291,"nextTopicId":72599}}
