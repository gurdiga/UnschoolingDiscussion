It reminded me of <br/>\nsomething I heard in church on Sunday.  A classmate of mine ( he&#39;s now 36) is <br/>\nin the Navy. His mother announced that he was on his way home from the war.   <br/>\nI overheard her telling a former Navy officer that Frank had crossed the <br/>\nequator and went through some type of hazing/initiation thing.  He had been <br/>\n&quot;promoted&quot; from a tadpole to a shellback.   She was very concerned, said that <br/>\nFrank didn&#39;t give her the details, but evidently it was bad.  She was asking <br/>\nthe other Navy man about it, to tell her what it was, what happens.   He just <br/>\npatted her hand and said, &quot;you dont want to know, some things are better left <br/>\nunknown&quot;   I could tell that his mother was so worried and disturbed by <br/>\nhearing this.   I felt so sorry for her, putting myself in her place if it <br/>\nwere one of my sons.  I know that military hazing is common, but its so <br/>\nsenseless.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132800757,"authorName":"encadia@aol.com","from":"encadia@...","profile":"lasvegashillgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] high school hazing","postDate":"1052429914","msgId":68175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5LjM4MzQ2YWMzLjJiZWMyODVhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68163,"nextInTopic":68178,"prevInTime":68174,"nextInTime":68176,"topicId":68115,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I watched the hazing this morning, couldn t believe it.
