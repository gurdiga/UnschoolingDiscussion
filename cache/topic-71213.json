Is it <br/>\n&gt; something a 6yo can learn?  Do some people just have<br/>\n&gt; it, and others <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Background:  My daughter is a very factual, literal,<br/>\n&gt; not-overly-<br/>\n&gt; emotional child.  She is very lacking in intuition<br/>\n&gt; or compassion.  <br/>\n&gt; She does not notice, or at least she does not seem<br/>\n&gt; affected by, <br/>\n&gt; people in pain (physical or emotional.)  (She has<br/>\n&gt; millions of <br/>\n&gt; wonderful qualities, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they<br/>\n&gt; are not the ones I <br/>\n&gt; am concerned about.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She does not realize when something she does is<br/>\n&gt; hurtful until I <br/>\n&gt; really sit her down and explain it.  Then she is<br/>\n&gt; very remorseful.  <br/>\n&gt; That, I figure, may come with time.  What concerns<br/>\n&gt; me more is how <br/>\n&gt; unaffected she is by people in pain.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For instance, one morning during her gymnastics<br/>\n&gt; class I almost passed <br/>\n&gt; out, and had to lay down on a mat and several people<br/>\n&gt; were gathered <br/>\n&gt; around me.

All my daughter was concerned about was<br/>\n&gt; telling me she is <br/>\n&gt; thirsty, can she get a drink.  The other kids all<br/>\n&gt; picked up on the <br/>\n&gt; idea that something was wrong, but not her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Fast forward to tonight:  My dad had back surgery<br/>\n&gt; yesterday, and it <br/>\n&gt; was a much more serious operation than any of us<br/>\n&gt; realized.  So <br/>\n&gt; finally tonight he was moved out of recovery and<br/>\n&gt; into surgical <br/>\n&gt; intensive care unit, so we went to visit him.  I<br/>\n&gt; took her, partly <br/>\n&gt; because I knew it wouldn&#39;t phase her, partly because<br/>\n&gt; I was hoping it <br/>\n&gt; would.  When we walked into his room, she asked, &quot;Is<br/>\n&gt; that Papa?&quot; <br/>\n&gt; because he really looked different.  He was coming<br/>\n&gt; in and out of <br/>\n&gt; consciousness, and kept wanting to change position<br/>\n&gt; (which hurt him <br/>\n&gt; tremendously) and was trying to pull at his many<br/>\n&gt; tubes, so they had <br/>\n&gt; to restrain him.  It was really pitiful.  But even<br/>\n&gt; in the midst of <br/>\n&gt; it, all she was worried about was whether she would<br/>\n&gt; be home in time <br/>\n&gt; for a tv show.  Then she asked why we were staying<br/>\n&gt; so long (about 40 <br/>\n&gt; minutes) and I finally went over and explained to<br/>\n&gt; her that he had <br/>\n&gt; been there all by himself (without family, anyway)<br/>\n&gt; all day, and he <br/>\n&gt; was in pain, and then I asked her to think about<br/>\n&gt; what she would want <br/>\n&gt; if she were in pain in a strange place.  I saw a<br/>\n&gt; glimmer of <br/>\n&gt; understanding.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t expect her to ever be an<br/>\n&gt; overly-compassionate, merciful type <br/>\n&gt; of person.  But I do wonder if there is something I<br/>\n&gt; should be doing <br/>\n&gt; to help her see things from other people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; perspectives.  Maybe just <br/>\n&gt; taking it incident by incident is all I can do.  I<br/>\n&gt; know I am in a lot <br/>\n&gt; of conflict right now just over seeing my dad like<br/>\n&gt; that, so maybe I <br/>\n&gt; am making more of this than I should.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n&gt;  I would <br/>\n&gt; appreciate any thoughts.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tory<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; PS:  She did cry when she watched ET and Air Bud, so<br/>\n&gt; it is in there <br/>\n&gt; somewhere.  Mainly for animals and<br/>\n&gt; extraterrestrials, though, it <br/>\n&gt; seems.  :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

My father was very soft spoken, almost a Mr. Rogers <br/>\ntype.  Would almost cry when my sister or I were hurt and would hold us <br/>\nclose.  Almost EVERY SINGLE time he got angry with us, he would later come to our <br/>\nroom later and apologize...even if he was right to be mad!!   I can also <br/>\nremember my mom crying when she heard a neighbor man had died.  She kept saying she <br/>\nfelt awful for his son, only 8 years old.  We were also avid readers of <br/>\nNational Geographic and often saw the disturbing pictures of the lives many &quot;less <br/>\nfortunate&quot; kids lived.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the hard lives my parents lived as children taught them compassion, <br/>\nand they passed it on to me.  My mother&#39;s dad left when she was young (about <br/>\n5), she was molested by an uncle, very poor much of her life.  My father&#39;s dad <br/>\ndied when he was only 8 and he and his brother were raised by their mother <br/>\nalone.  She was a nurse, so maybe her compassion and caring for people rubbed off <br/>\non them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder if having siblings helps &quot;breed&quot; compassion.

Most recently, my mom stumped her toe over at my sis&#39; house and my <br/>\nniece had to go out of the room to keep from passing out.  She was very <br/>\nconcerned when my grandpa died recently.  She really didnt know grandpa that well, <br/>\nbut her heart was just broken because her Grandma&#39;s daddy died.  She didn&#39;t go <br/>\nto the funeral because she didn&#39;t want to see her Grandma so sad.

He is a really compassionate child too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe story about your daughter not being too concerned about your Dad&#39;s <br/>\nsurgery reminded me of Landon when I had Jon Phillip.  I had forgotten all about <br/>\nthis, but a few days ago we were watching old home videos.  I was in the hospital <br/>\nafter having JP.  I called Landon on the phone to tell him about the arrival <br/>\nof his baby brother.  He had been in school that day and his aunt picked him <br/>\nup.  He didnt know I had had JP.  His reaction??  He was mad at me because I <br/>\nwas supposed to take him to Toys R us to get a new toy.  He was 8, and <br/>\nobviously, his own self interests were more important than the fact that I was lying <br/>\nflat on my back in the hospital from giving birth... LOL.     My sister took him <br/>\nto Toys R us and they stopped back by the hospital on the way home.  Landon <br/>\nwas thrilled with his new toy.  The new baby?  Ahh, been there, done that, he <br/>\nwas not impressed.    He was ( still is) a great big brother.  But he has <br/>\nalways been more of a self focused person.    He IS compassionate, but mostly just <br/>\ntowards people/things that affect him personally.    I do not see that as <br/>\nflawed.  I just see it as  part of his personality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129135524,"authorName":"Debra Watson","from":"&quot;Debra Watson&quot; &lt;debidoy@...&gt;","profile":"sharon_tate05","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Compassion","postDate":"1054179605","msgId":71219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRDU4MTE1LjAwMDAwRi4wMTY2OEBDT01QQVE+","referencesHeader":"PDE4NS4xYmEyZTcwZC4yYzA2ZDI2Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71217,"nextInTopic":71220,"prevInTime":71218,"nextInTime":71220,"topicId":71213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Really?

I found a short definition as follows:  <br/>\n<br/>\nInterpersonal:  Children who are leaders among their peers, who are <br/>\ngood at communicating and who seem to understand others&#39; feelings and <br/>\nmotives possess interpersonal intelligence. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is so strong on the first two parts, and completely lacking on <br/>\nthe third.  In almost any group situation, she falls into the role of <br/>\nleader, and most of the other kids are drawn to her in that <br/>\nposition.  But it is a no-nonsense type of leadership.  She is big on <br/>\nthings being fair--to anyone, not just her.  She is way beyond her <br/>\nyears in communication.  But boy, understanding others&#39; feelings, <br/>\nwell, that just doesn&#39;t even occur to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did talk to her before we went to the hospital.  I didn&#39;t make it a <br/>\nreal big deal, just explained that Papa had an operation on his <br/>\nback.  <br/>\nShe asked what they did, so I told her that they cut open his lower <br/>\nback and put in a long metal rod and ten 3&quot; screws into his bone.  <br/>\nShe made a face, then asked if she would have to have that surgery <br/>\nwhen she was old, and I told her probably not, then she seemed fine <br/>\nwith it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Compassion is probably a pretty mature emotion.  Some things seem <br/>\n </span></blockquote>like parts <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of compassion, like pity and fear and queasiness, but I think <br/>\n </span></blockquote>compassion is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; higher and more philosophical than those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess compassion is a bit much to expect of her.  But I would have <br/>\nexpected to see a little bit of uneasiness with the situation.  I did <br/>\nthink about how she would probably make a good surgeon, something I <br/>\nwould be way too queasy to do.  She would just lack in those bedside <br/>\nmanners.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry about your dad.  Back surgery is always very scary.  Keith <br/>\n </span></blockquote>had one at <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 18 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks.  None of us realized what bad shape his back was in.  Not <br/>\neven the doctor.  When he actually got into his back and saw what it <br/>\nlooked like, he said that the only people he had ever seen with backs <br/>\nthat bad were invalids due to the pain.  (He was just out digging and <br/>\ninstalling a water line three days before surgery.)  He has such a <br/>\nhigh pain tolerance.  I think that is what makes it so hard to see <br/>\nhim in pain, just knowing how bad it must be.  But he was on morphine <br/>\nand was about to get his next valium dose when we left, so he should <br/>\nbe feeling better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTory</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Compassion","postDate":"1054177388","msgId":71216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4NS4xYmEyZTcwZC4yYzA2ZDI2Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71214,"nextInTopic":71217,"prevInTime":71215,"nextInTime":71217,"topicId":71213,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/28/03 8:51:29 PM, debidoy@msn.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2113363334\">In a message dated 5/28/03 8:51:29 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debidoy@...\">debidoy@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know about your religious convictions, but as a Believer,<br/>\nfollowing the life of Christ really helped me a lot as well.

Is it \r<br/>\nsomething a 6yo can learn?  Do some people just have it, and others \r<br/>\ndon&#39;t?\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBackground:  My daughter is a very factual, literal, not-overly-\r<br/>\nemotional child.  She is very lacking in intuition or compassion.  \r<br/>\nShe does not notice, or at least she does not seem affected by, \r<br/>\npeople in pain (physical or emotional.)  (She has millions of \r<br/>\nwonderful qualities, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they are not the ones I \r<br/>\nam concerned about.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nShe does not realize when something she does is hurtful until I \r<br/>\nreally sit her down and explain it.  Then she is very remorseful.  \r<br/>\nThat, I figure, may come with time.  What concerns me more is how \r<br/>\nunaffected she is by people in pain.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFor instance, one morning during her gymnastics class I almost passed \r<br/>\nout, and had to lay down on a mat and several people were gathered \r<br/>\naround me.  It was near the end of class so the instructor led the \r<br/>\nclass to a side room so that they wouldn&#39;t see what was going on.  \r<br/>\n(Although they had to walk by me to get there.)  Most of the kids had \r<br/>\nlooks on their faces like they were worried or wondering what was \r<br/>\ngoing on.  All my daughter was concerned about was telling me she is \r<br/>\nthirsty, can she get a drink.  The other kids all picked up on the \r<br/>\nidea that something was wrong, but not her.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nFast forward to tonight:  My dad had back surgery yesterday, and it \r<br/>\nwas a much more serious operation than any of us realized.  So \r<br/>\nfinally tonight he was moved out of recovery and into surgical \r<br/>\nintensive care unit, so we went to visit him.  I took her, partly \r<br/>\nbecause I knew it wouldn&#39;t phase her, partly because I was hoping it \r<br/>\nwould.  When we walked into his room, she asked, &quot;Is that Papa?&quot; \r<br/>\nbecause he really looked different.  He was coming in and out of \r<br/>\nconsciousness, and kept wanting to change position (which hurt him \r<br/>\ntremendously) and was trying to pull at his many tubes, so they had \r<br/>\nto restrain him.  It was really pitiful.  But even in the midst of \r<br/>\nit, all she was worried about was whether she would be home in time \r<br/>\nfor a tv show.  Then she asked why we were staying so long (about 40 \r<br/>\nminutes) and I finally went over and explained to her that he had \r<br/>\nbeen there all by himself (without family, anyway) all day, and he \r<br/>\nwas in pain, and then I asked her to think about what she would want \r<br/>\nif she were in pain in a strange place.  I saw a glimmer of \r<br/>\nunderstanding.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect her to ever be an overly-compassionate, merciful type \r<br/>\nof person.  But I do wonder if there is something I should be doing \r<br/>\nto help her see things from other people&#39;s perspectives.  Maybe just \r<br/>\ntaking it incident by incident is all I can do.  I know I am in a lot \r<br/>\nof conflict right now just over seeing my dad like that, so maybe I \r<br/>\nam making more of this than I should.  I don&#39;t know.  I would \r<br/>\nappreciate any thoughts.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nTory\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPS:  She did cry when she watched ET and Air Bud, so it is in there \r<br/>\nsomewhere.  Mainly for animals and extraterrestrials, though, it \r<br/>\nseems.  :-)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYahoo! Groups Sponsor\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
