She wants <br/>\n&gt; to be just like them, she loves to sit at the table with assignments and <br/>\n&gt; wants to be a part of the lunch box<br/>\n&gt; carrying crowd.  I&#39;ve tried to handle some of this by supplying her with <br/>\n&gt; &quot;school type&quot; books (she loves them and does them with no prompting from me <br/>\n&gt; although she really wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time for...&quot;) and when <br/>\n&gt; school starts again in this area I want<br/>\n&gt; to do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her <br/>\n&gt; friends not being around much anymore. (Even the ones who homeschool are <br/>\n&gt; &quot;going back to school.&quot;)  Maybe a trip to the dinosaur exhibit at the <br/>\n&gt; Natural History Museum?<br/>\n&gt; Anyway the point of this is to ask:  What do you do when the whole family <br/>\n&gt; is unschooling and one doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I was a kid my sister and I loved to &quot;play school.&quot; I can&#39;t speak for my <br/>\nsister, but I really hated Real School. But playing school was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see any conflict with your playing school with your daughter. Get her <br/>\na lunchbox with her favorite characters on it and put her lunch in it. (Make <br/>\nsure there&#39;s a thermos!)  Buy new crayons and pencils and a notebook. Give <br/>\nher assignments. The trick is: SAY you&#39;re &quot;playing school.&quot; Invite HER to be <br/>\nthe teacher sometimes. Stress that the fun part of Playing School is you can <br/>\ndo the fun things about school without the boring things...and you can stop <br/>\nto go on a &quot;field trip&quot; or bake cookies or read a story... whenever you want <br/>\nto!<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk her if she really wants to try school, or if she thinks Playing School <br/>\nwould be okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39387,"nextTopicId":39401}}
