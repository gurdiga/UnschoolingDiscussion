In fact, when he plays games, usually guys<br/>\nteam up (sometimes as many as 11 to one!) to play against him. He&#39;s<br/>\njust gotten crazy good!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 year old son is becoming better and better at Halo 2 and is in a<br/>\ntournament today. He&#39;s been so cute this week, working to get his<br/>\nresponsibilities done so that he can devote more time to training.<br/>\nHe&#39;s been downloading strategies off the Internet, printing them,<br/>\nstudying them, and then using them in trial sessions with his buddy<br/>\nwho will be his partner. This friend spent the night last night and I<br/>\ngot such akick out of their discourse - how they worked together, how<br/>\nthey determined who would be the boss, what codes theya re using to<br/>\ncue each other into where their positions are (so that the opponents<br/>\nat the tournament won&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a high stakes week for both of my boys who spend a ton of<br/>\ntime online gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat hit me this a.m. is that sometimes we just don&#39;t realize how<br/>\npowerful all this gaming is. We think that it is somehow not as good<br/>\nas sports or music. Yet look at all those skills my boys are learning<br/>\njust from hours online?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the sense of pride they have in becoming really good reminds me of<br/>\nkids who are stars on their soccer teams. I just don&#39;t get the same<br/>\nlevel of insight because I&#39;m not a gamer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust had to share. I&#39;m way proud of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108427,"nextTopicId":108483}}
