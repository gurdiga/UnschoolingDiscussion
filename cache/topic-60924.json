If your son acts younger than his age, he can play with<br/>\nchildren of that younger age.  Or a mixed group of kids, both younger<br/>\nand older, but not obsessed with being cool and precocious.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck finding homeschooling groups in your area.  If you and your<br/>\nson have the same week off for spring break, you may be able to check<br/>\nout a local group&#39;s park day before June.  (I won&#39;t pressure you to take<br/>\nyour son out of school until you are ready, but go ahead and make<br/>\ncontact with local homeschoolers as soon as you can.  They really are a<br/>\ngreat resource.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":91043140,"authorName":"bellamora@aol.com","from":"bellamora@...","profile":"CAS1999","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;Graduate&quot; and Special needs","postDate":"1047504393","msgId":60924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZC40ZjRjZWNkLjJiYTEwMDA5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":60934,"prevInTime":60923,"nextInTime":60925,"topicId":60924,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/12/03 4:01:42 PM Eastern Standard Time, leschke@shaw.ca ...

I&#39;m a single parent who teaches full-time at a local <br/>\nuniversity. If I pull my son out of school without planning how I&#39;m going to <br/>\nhandle the practical details of the switch, my son may end up going from the <br/>\n&quot;frying pan into the fire.&quot;   The decision to homeschool was made only last <br/>\nweek, though philosophically it&#39;s been coming a long time.  He&#39;s only got 12 <br/>\nweeks of standard school left, during which time I can debrief him every day <br/>\nand keep his hopes up about next year.  I especially have to figure out how <br/>\nI&#39;m going to get him to be with other children his age since he likes <br/>\nsocializing even though he acts younger than his age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what the rest of you do for kids who have special needs (there <br/>\nare certain expensive special ed services my son needs -- like speech therapy <br/>\nfor articulation). The public school district must provide them, but they <br/>\nwill do so more readily if they think he&#39;s coming back next year than if they <br/>\nthink he&#39;s &quot;off their hands.&quot;  We have a meeting with the school staff about <br/>\nthose decisions before the end of the school year and I&#39;m keeping the topic <br/>\nof homeschooling a secret from everyone but my son in the meantime. No one <br/>\nhas to know why he&#39;s secretly smiling during the school day ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60941,"nextTopicId":60946}}
