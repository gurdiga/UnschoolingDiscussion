I don&#39;t stock, inventory or deliver any<br/>\nproducts.  I just set up the accounts and get paid.  There&#39;s a 96%<br/>\nre-order rate, the products make sense and are need based and unique to<br/>\nthis company which has been around for over 15 years.  It gives me the<br/>\nflexibility and income out family needs and I can continue to build it<br/>\nand give myself my own raise.  If this is the kind of business you&#39;re<br/>\nlooking for, feel free to e-mail me.  Good Luck on your search!<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15606,"nextTopicId":15573}}
