What I meant was that if the car is starting out, if <br/>\nit isn&#39;t moving and then is moving, it&#39;ll take a few seconds to get up to 30 <br/>\nmph so, in reality it won&#39;t be going 30 mph for the whole 2 hours. It&#39;ll be <br/>\nfor 2 hours minus a few seconds. So I was saying that we should just ignore <br/>\nthose few seconds and pretend the car is going the full 30 mph right from the <br/>\nget-go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; The sign of the second number indicates whether the car is in drive or in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sign is negative, it means the car is in &quot;reverse.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The value of the second number is how many hours the car goes (at the <br/>\n&gt; speed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; given by the first number).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why would the sign for drive or reverse be attached to the hours it <br/>\n&gt; travels?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is arbitrary. I could say that it is because they go &quot;in reverse&quot; or &quot;in <br/>\ndrive&quot; for that many hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sign of the first number is which way the car is facing. Again, you could <br/>\nask why that would be attached to how fast it moves? It is arbitrary. I could <br/>\nsay that it is how fast it is going while facing in that direction, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT - I could switch the meanings and it would still make just as much sense. <br/>\nFor those with the patience - I&#39;ll do it:<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you have to give meaning to positive and negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example - imagine a car sitting on a long east/west road. Draw a <br/>\nhorizontal line on a piece of paper. Put a mark in the middle of the line - <br/>\nthat&#39;s where you&#39;re standing, watching this car. The east is to your right <br/>\nand the west is to your left. You might want to use a toy car for this. Sit <br/>\nit on that marked spot in the center of your line.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re going to multiple two signed numbers. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe sign of the first number indicates whether the car is in drive or in <br/>\nreverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if the <br/>\nsign is negative, it means the car is in &quot;reverse.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of the first number is going to tell us what the speed of the car <br/>\nis when it takes off (we&#39;ll pretend it is at a constant speed - not worry <br/>\nabout the time it takes to accelerate to that speed). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the first number is +30, then it means the car is in drive and that <br/>\nits speed is 30 miles per hour. If the first number is -30, it means the car <br/>\nis in reverse and that its speed is 30 miles per hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sign of the second number indicates which direction the car is facing. If <br/>\n<br/>\nit is facing east, we will give the second number a &quot;+&quot; sign and if the car <br/>\nis <br/>\nfacing west we&#39;ll give the second number a &quot;-&quot; sign. So - the meaning of the <br/>\nsign on the second number is whether the car itself is facing east or west.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of the second number is how many hours the car goes (at the speed <br/>\ngiven by the first number). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the second number is -2, then it means that the car is facing west and <br/>\nit travels for 2 hours. If the second number is, +2, then the car is facing <br/>\neast <br/>\nand it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose we want to multiply +30 times +2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is in drive. The <br/>\nvalue means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe + in the second number means the car is facing east. And the value of 2 <br/>\nmeans that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when <br/>\nit starts moving it is going to also MOVE to the east - the way it is facing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the <br/>\neast. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>\n<br/>\nends up to the east of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how many <br/>\nmiles from the starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\n<br/>\nand so on --- I switched the meanings of the &quot;signs&quot; of the two numbers -- <br/>\nbut it still works out sensibly.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] multiplying positives and negatives","postDate":"1020721219","msgId":36798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4RkM3MDgzLjg2OTQlZmV0dGVyb2xsQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2My5kNTQyY2ZkLjJhMDgzMDFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36792,"nextInTopic":36800,"prevInTime":36797,"nextInTime":36799,"topicId":36792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 5/6/02 3:14 PM, PSoroosh@aol.com at PSoroosh@aol.com wrote: I thought that was *very* good! :-) ...

You don&#39;t usually have to <br/>\nconsciously do this for just positives because you do it automatically in <br/>\nyour head. If I ask you, &quot;What is 2 times 30?&quot; You can say it is 60. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to THINK about what the positives mean -- you don&#39;t stop and think <br/>\nabout it as +2 times +30 equals +60, because you are comfortable with <br/>\npositive numbers meaning - it could mean that you received two payments of 30 <br/>\ndollars each so you got 60 dollars or  they could mean things like a car <br/>\ndrives 2 hours at 30 miles an hour so it has gone 60 miles. These are <br/>\nmeanings that just make sense - you very likely had some experience with such <br/>\nmeanings before you ever learned to multiply. You KNEW that if 3 people gave <br/>\nyou 2 cookies each that you&#39;d end up with 6 cookies, probably before you <br/>\nlearned to multiply. So you had some &quot;hooks&quot; to use when you learned to <br/>\nmultiply positive numbers together. Not so with negative numbers - you very <br/>\npossibly didn&#39;t have any automatic hooks for those.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you work, in REAL life, with positive AND negative numbers, the meanings <br/>\nwill be clear. But when you&#39;re just doing pure &quot;math&quot; problems, there is a <br/>\ntendency to try to do it without any context - with no meaning attached - and <br/>\nthat is too hard, at first. You can do it later, when you&#39;re CONVINCED <br/>\nalready that there are ways for it to mean something real.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you have to give meaning to positive and negative.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example - imagine a car sitting on a long east/west road.

So - the meaning of the <br/>\nsign on the first number is whether the car itself is facing east or west.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of the first number is going to tell us what the speed of the car <br/>\nis when it takes off (we&#39;ll pretend it is at a constant speed - not worry <br/>\nabout the time it takes to accelerate to that speed). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the first number is +30, then it means the car is facing east and that <br/>\nits speed is 30 miles per hour. If the first number is -30, it means the car <br/>\nis facing west and that its speed is 30 miles per hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sign of the second number indicates whether the car is in drive or in <br/>\nreverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if the <br/>\nsign is negative, it means the car is in &quot;reverse.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe value of the second number is how many hours the car goes (at the speed <br/>\ngiven by the first number). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if the second number is -2, then it means that the car is in reverse and <br/>\nit travels for 2 hours. If the second number is, +2, then the car is in drive <br/>\nand it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose we want to multiply +30 times +2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is facing east (to the right). The <br/>\nvalue means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe + in the second number means the car is in &quot;drive&quot;. And the value of 2 <br/>\nmeans that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when <br/>\nit starts moving it is going to also MOVE to the east - the way it is facing. <br/>\nAnd it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the <br/>\neast. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>\nends up to the east of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how many <br/>\nmiles from the starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\nSuppose we want to multiply -30 times +2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;-&quot; in the first number means the car is facing west (to the left). The <br/>\nvalue means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe + in the second number means the car is in &quot;drive&quot;. And the value of 2 <br/>\nmeans that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - make your toy car face west (to the left). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when it <br/>\nstarts moving it is going to also MOVE to the west- the way it is facing. And <br/>\nit is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the west. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our answer is going to be -60. The &quot;-&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>\nends up to the west (left) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>\nmany miles from the starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\nSuppose we want to multiply +30 times -2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is facing east (to the right). The <br/>\nvalue means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;-&quot; in the second number means the car&#39;s transmission is in &quot;reverse&quot;. <br/>\nAnd the value of 2 means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;reverse&quot; so when <br/>\nit starts moving it is going to MOVE the opposite of the way it is facing - <br/>\nto the west (left). And it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end <br/>\nup 60 miles to the west. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our answer is going to be -60. The &quot;-&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>\nends up to the west (left) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>\nmany miles from the starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now the moment you&#39;ve all been waiting for &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose we want to multiply -30 times -2.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;-&quot; in the first number means the car is facing west (to the left). The <br/>\nvalue means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;-&quot; in the second number means the car&#39;s transmission is in &quot;reverse&quot;. <br/>\nAnd the value of 2 means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay - make your toy car face west (to the left). It is in &quot;reverse&quot; so when <br/>\nit starts moving it is going to MOVE the opposite of the way it is facing. <br/>\nSince it is facing west and it is reverse, it&#39;ll MOVE to the east. And it is <br/>\ngoing to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the east. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>\nends up to the east (right) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>\nmany miles from the starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is ONE example where the signs of the numbers have some meaning and <br/>\nso the sign of the answer has a meaning too. There are other similar kinds of <br/>\nexamples. If you FOOLED with enough of them BEFORE you had to actually learn <br/>\nthe paper-and-pencil computational skill - then it wouldn&#39;t be that hard - it <br/>\nwould make sense and slip into place in your brain. It is harder to do it <br/>\nafter you&#39;ve got it into your head that positives and negatives are <br/>\nconfusing.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36817,"nextTopicId":36794}}
