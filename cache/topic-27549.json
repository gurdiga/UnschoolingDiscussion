Studies showed that during meditation,<br/>\nyour brain comes to produce alpha waves - a state of deep relaxation and<br/>\nhigh awareness.  Studies of people watching television showed them going<br/>\ninto a wave zone (beta? - I&#39;ll have to look this up);  this state clearly<br/>\nwas one of reduced awareness to surroundings.  (Ever tried to ask something<br/>\nof a person watching TV in this state? They  appear to ignore you.)  At any<br/>\nrate,  this state of consciousness,  with its low level of awareness,  seems<br/>\ndecidedly unhealthy to stay in for prolonged periods.   OTOH,  reading and<br/>\ncomputer time also at times seem to &#39;take over &#39; to the neglect of other<br/>\nphysical,  environmental needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regard to video games.....I wonder if studies have been done.  Maybe the<br/>\ninteraction makes a difference in brain functioning -?-<br/>\n<br/>\n.  I guess for me the questions boil down to.....how do we teach our<br/>\nchildren/orselves discipline to care for themselves physically,<br/>\nemotionally,  etc?  OR....how to we promote their growth and encourage them<br/>\nto find a balance?   The media producers and advertisers are majorly<br/>\ninvested in us/our children spending as much time in front of their<br/>\nadverstisements as possible.   Do we simply allow our children to be fed<br/>\nthis stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/9/01 4:38:46 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ziggy.hindson@...\">Ziggy.hindson@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; The fallacy of using a label such as &quot;deschooling&quot; is that some children<br/>\nwho<br/>\nhave never been to school nor have they ever been in an environment that was<br/>\ncontrolling will still sit like mindless little bloob in front of the tube.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not any child I have ever met or known.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot tell by looking at someone what they are thinking, and they ARE<br/>\nthinking.
