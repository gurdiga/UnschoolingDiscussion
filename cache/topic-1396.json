You can put a line item in your family budget and sit down<br/>\ncheerfully each August and order &quot;books and stuff&quot; with the kids, but if you<br/>\nlimit it to curriculum-style books, it&#39;s telling the kids something about<br/>\nwhat books you think are &quot;more valuable&quot;, so I&#39;d haul out all the book<br/>\ncatalogs and pour over them together. Pick out what looks great (I&#39;d<br/>\nactually suggest doing this more often than each September, quarterly or<br/>\neven monthly, the amount of money of course decreasing if you do it more<br/>\noften, unless you are a lotter winner &lt;g&gt;), buy it. Pay no attention to<br/>\nwhether it is curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it arrives, it becomes just so much unschooling fodder, to be used or<br/>\nnot, to be used &quot;properly&quot; (i.e, according to the underactive imagination of<br/>\nthe curriculum designer) or NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have fantasies about being a steeplechase jockey. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m 33 years old,<br/>\n200 lbs, 5&#39;9&quot; tall and don&#39;t have the money or land to keep a horse. The<br/>\nfantasy doesn&#39;t hurt anybody, but my bankrupting the household and being<br/>\ntossed from my steeplechaser at the first fence would hurt everybody,<br/>\nincluding me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t tell you to &quot;get over it&quot;. I mourn my never-to-have-been<br/>\nsteeplechasing career. I read Dick Francis books and plan to attend some<br/>\nsteeplechases as an observer. So I will say, find a way to get some part of<br/>\nwhat you want while abiding by what I&#39;m thinking should really be the<br/>\nunschooler&#39;s creed: &quot;first do no harm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamhartley@...\">pamhartley@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Andi Kaufman","from":"Andi Kaufman &lt;tl2b@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hIt3vp7X7C3lCJ-2GG871KrqsDYOMMdEygbZ-sJK_xQM_QuKh8VHYmIzue7s0mTHGf9pdbpBHGUIHVXXNbzoN_HDt7rYA1UZqQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Addicted to curriculum!

I have never seen a Sonlight catalog, but I have plenty of<br/>\nother education catalogs, and I was just like you in school. I have often said<br/>\nthat if I could get paid to go to college some more instead of having to pay for<br/>\nit, school would be my life&#39;s work. I would have a dozen or more degrees in<br/>\neverything.  To make matters worse for me, my degree is in Education, and I was<br/>\ntaught to teach a certain way.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a huge venture for me, and I&#39;m like you, wondering how to turn<br/>\noff the natural instinct to do it the way I did it. In my case, my kids have<br/>\nnever loved school the way I did, so that is a huge motivator. And I have done<br/>\nenough reading on unschooling to know it makes tremendous sense, especially with<br/>\nkids like mine who are very into the experience of the learning, not the task.<br/>\nAll I can say is, do what I do. Sit down and write out wonderful, detailed<br/>\nlesson plans for every day of the year, and then abandon them after the first<br/>\nweek when your kids can&#39;t stand it and you can see that! (Yes, last year I went<br/>\nout and bought a teacher&#39;s lesson plan book, and had my sons&#39; lessons planned<br/>\nout for like 6 months in the future. The first time we went to the muesum<br/>\ninstead, the whole thing fell apart!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and get yourself some workbooks to play in!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Butterflye</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Laura Bush","from":"&quot;Laura Bush&quot; &lt;bushla@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"QPRVfDQ9p6KZETzr0AUcqdB-aDiGaqVDvIBOu_lAraSKo0dmz1iB8hNd6BeHtvOZR-8wFlrOYkYmfI0t_wtBxcjwnaWX","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Addicted to curriculum!

The first book I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-385012896\">I have an unschooling problem I&#39;d like some input on. First, a little intro:<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been homeschooling for 4 years; 3 kids, ages 10, 6, and 2. The first<br/>\nbook I read about homeschooling was John Holt&#39;s Teach Your Own, followed by<br/>\nthe Colfaxes&#39; Homeschooling for Excellence. I have since read most of the<br/>\nstandard recommended books for folks interested in unschooling, and agree<br/>\nwith most of what unschoolers say about how people learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never used a curriculum, per se, though I dabbled in unit studies. During<br/>\none of those dabbling times, I was reading to my daughter about the layers<br/>\nof the earth, and I could see her eyes glaze over. I put the book down and<br/>\nvowed right then never to waste her time or my time trying to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nsomething she wasn&#39;t interested in. Mostly I&#39;ve kept to that vow, though I<br/>\nhave on occasion begged her to do some written math.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe in unschooling; I see no point in trying to force-feed an<br/>\neducation. So, what&#39;s my problem? Here it is: I confess to a love for<br/>\ncurriculum. I would love to order a literature based curriculum for us all<br/>\nto do. I love the idea of all those books showing up on the doorstep,<br/>\ncomplete with a schedule for when to read what. I love to seek out books on<br/>\nmy own as well, and plan &quot;units&quot; on periods of history, collecting resources<br/>\nfrom a variety of catalogs. The kids enjoy these immersions in times--the<br/>\nbooks I choose are good, and I quickly drop the duds. I am alert to fading<br/>\ninterest and don&#39;t push. But I harbor a secret envy of folks who order these<br/>\nterrific curricula (not textbook curricula! it&#39;s Sonlight I lust after..)<br/>\nand carry out the plans in their teacher&#39;s manuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking in recent weeks about why this is,  and how to get it all<br/>\nout of my system without screwing up our home learning. I know folks (my dh<br/>\nis one) who say, So get a curriculum for yourself and do it! But I know<br/>\nthat&#39;s not the ticket for me. I think it has to do with harking back to my<br/>\nchildhood, where September brought the smell of new books and book covers,<br/>\ncrisp notebooks, and, later on, syllabi promising a semester of learning<br/>\nbliss. I loved school, and I want to do it all over with my kids. I can see<br/>\nthe damage school did to me (I was the A student who desperately feared to<br/>\nfail, who learned for the test and then forgot, who excelled in pleasing<br/>\ndiverse teachers to the detriment of my actual education). But still, I<br/>\nloved school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I the only unschooler who secretly drools over the Sonlight catalog? And<br/>\nhow can I loose myself from this bizarre addiction to learning plans?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Bush<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laura@...\">laura@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.honeypot-hollow.com\">http://www.honeypot-hollow.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1400,"nextTopicId":1423}}
