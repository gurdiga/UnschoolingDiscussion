I use the I.M.<br/>\nHealthy brand; I used to mail order it from Whole Foods online, but they<br/>\nhave recently merged with another site and I can&#39;t seem to order it. I am<br/>\nstill looking for another place to get it. It does have other ingredients<br/>\nbesides soy nuts (sucanat-cane juice, naturally pressed soybean oil, salt)<br/>\nthat give it a sweeter flavor and better texture. So if you are looking for<br/>\njust plain soy nut butter, this is not the one. I hope this wasn&#39;t the<br/>\nbrand that you tried already but didn&#39;t like. <br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9836,"nextTopicId":9787}}
