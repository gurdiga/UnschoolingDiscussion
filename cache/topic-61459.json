Can you picture it?  The Barney kids come out of their <br/>\nschool and there is a new boy already playing with Barney.  They <br/>\nintroduce themselves and ask him why he&#39;s not in school.

It looked like a book full of fun<br/>\nactivities to do that expand on childrens books, but right from the<br/>\nstart it turned out to be a lecture against electrical toys: a TV,<br/>\nelectronic games, a joystick, a VCR, a stereo, and an astonishing<br/>\nvariety of remote controls.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt gives an example of a family that promotes reading.  The kid is read<br/>\nto quietly before bed and is learning.  In the second example, of a<br/>\nfamily that apparently has idiot kids who wont ever read, has harsh<br/>\nsounds emanating from whatever electronic device is being played<br/>\nwithin.  The first child drifts quietly off to sleep.  For the second<br/>\nchild, sleep, when it comes, is not gentle.  All this right in the<br/>\nintro.<br/>\n <br/>\nI really resent the implication that letting kids play video games means<br/>\nthat your home doesnt promote reading.  I have my choice of TV, videos,<br/>\nthe computer, or books, and I use each daily.  I read more books than<br/>\nanyone I know.  The more I read, the faster I read, and Ive been<br/>\nreading three books a day for a long time, not to mention all the books<br/>\nI read to my children.  I read them hundreds of books each year, which<br/>\nis why Im always on the lookout for books that recommend childrens<br/>\nbooks.  And I dont read bedtime stories.  My son plays computer games<br/>\nbefore bed.  His recent choices have been Thomas the Tank Engine Railway<br/>\nAdventures, Zoo Tycoon, and Blues Clues Kindergarten.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was telling my husband earlier (after reading the intro and tossing<br/>\nthe book down) that its really naïve in this day and age for educators<br/>\nto ignore the learning that goes on when children use computers and<br/>\nvideos.  Im a huge bibliophile, but come on.  How could anyone say, in<br/>\n2000 (the copyright date), that the kid whos read a bedtime story is<br/>\nlearning more than the kid who play video games before bed?
