They were eye opening<br/>\nto say the least. Along the lines of Trading Spouses in terms of viewing<br/>\nfamily dynamics. One show had a family live with an African family for 10<br/>\ndays. This family was a real mess; words fail me! The African family was so<br/>\namazing. Full of joy and trust in one another.  The younger American boy<br/>\nwas so angry, always yelling at his parents and having tantrums. He became<br/>\nso attached to the African father.
