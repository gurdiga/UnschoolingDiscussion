It didn&#39;t really matter how good or<br/>\nbad reality was as long as the family/house/belongings/vacations/job/etc.<br/>\nlooked good and presentable. It was all about &quot;what will people think of<br/>\nus&quot;.  Lots of formality.  He hated that and still does, but sometimes<br/>\naspects of it still come back to haunt him. We live in a small townhouse, I<br/>\nam admittedly not the best housekeeper nor am I a gormet cook.  All the<br/>\nfancy china and silver from his mother and grandmother sit wrapped nicely in<br/>\nbasement....unused. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an ounce of formaility to our<br/>\nhome. 90% of the time, he loves the fun and chaos of our home. But<br/>\noccasionaly his upbringing rears it&#39;s ugly head then it&#39;s difficult for all<br/>\nof us. Usually it&#39;s when he has stress from other areas of his life.

I had<br/>\nan awesome moment about half an hour ago that made me feel really<br/>\ngood.  My youngest son told me matter of factly that he had spilled<br/>\nhis milk.  I got up, found something close to begin cleaning and asked<br/>\nhim to get another towel that was farther away, but was big enough to<br/>\nfinish the job.  We cleaned the milk up together and got him into some<br/>\nnew clothes.  This probably sounds really simple, and basically, the<br/>\nactions were the same ones I would have followed just a few months<br/>\nago.  The spill was cleaned and the clothes changed.  The difference<br/>\nthis time was that no one yelled, screamed, sighed, huffed, growled,<br/>\nstomped and no one else cried, screamed or got scared of his father.<br/>\nIt also took a fraction of the time to just smile and wipe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the middle of all that I had a moment where I realized how much<br/>\nnicer it was to just deal with the situation.
