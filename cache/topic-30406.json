The one we use is called a<br/>\nKangaroo seat and it is corduroy covered foam. It lifts the child high<br/>\nenough so that the lap and shoulder strap land in the right position. When<br/>\nwe bought ours, which is now being used by child #3, I took them out to the<br/>\ncar to check how they fit before I purchased one. Depending on the shape of<br/>\nyour seats one may work better than another. I also have an apparatus that<br/>\nyou fit on the seat belt like a glove that adjusts the shoulder strap so<br/>\nthat the seat belt can do the work it&#39;s designed for. This sleeve or glove<br/>\ncan easily be removed and transferred to any car that your child finds<br/>\nthemselves in. Here in Toronto there are several stores that specialize in<br/>\nchild safety equipment and there is a fair amount of selection these days.<br/>\nJust using the lap belt without the shoulder support is useless. From the<br/>\nresearch I&#39;ve read, should you get rear ended with your child or yourself in<br/>\na lap belt only you have a very good chance of snapping your spine and<br/>\ncrushing your inner organs!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3979435,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","profile":"naake1999","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"booster seat/belts for 4yo?","postDate":"1009704229","msgId":30406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExBVzItRjcwQVJOUXI3bUJHaUgwMDAxMWVlOUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30408,"prevInTime":30405,"nextInTime":30407,"topicId":30406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have an old 4-door sedan (89 Toyota Camry) with sliding lap/shoulder belts in the back seat, plus lap belts only in the middle of the back seat.
