I have found quite a few sites including <br/>\nyahoo groups for unschooling teenagers but none of them seem active <br/>\nand in fact some of the links included in a website started by NBTS <br/>\nteenagers are not in service. Maybe if we all told our kids about the <br/>\none at unschooling.com there would be a central place to get started. <br/>\nIt just seems like there are a lot of them but none are active which <br/>\nis too bad because my daughter really enjoys interacting with other <br/>\nunschooled teenagers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn her words after coming back from camp, she said that it was so <br/>\nstimulating to be around other kids who follow their passions and <br/>\nhave so many interests.... Not only did it motivate her to rekindle <br/>\nsome of her passions (she has struggled being an unschooler <br/>\nthroughout her life as she tends towards being not very self-<br/>\nmotivated), it also was the reason she changed her mind about going <br/>\nto high school next year for social reasons (she like other teens <br/>\nreally need peer interaction). She had signed up with a high school <br/>\ncorrespondence school so that she could learn how to learn through <br/>\ntextbooks in preparation for going to school. After coming back from <br/>\ncamp she remarked that she didn&#39;t feel like her social needs would be <br/>\nmet going to school since the kids there are forced to conform by <br/>\npeer pressure where she was so happy to be surrounded by individuals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82689,"nextTopicId":82700}}
