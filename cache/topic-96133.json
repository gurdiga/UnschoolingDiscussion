We have<br/>\ncome to believe that all hurt, all damage is to be prevented.  That if<br/>\nANYBODY at all gets hurt, somebody dropped the ball.  People are downright<br/>\nparanoid, even in the little town we live in, of kidnappers, burglars,<br/>\nrapists.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople seem very happy to limit their movements, their freedom, their lives<br/>\nin a vain attempt for nothing bad to ever happen to anybody.  Reminds me of<br/>\nour country&#39;s reaction to 911.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, I was needed to run into the grocery store for a couple of<br/>\nthings the other day.  I had my 11yo son and his 10yo friend with me.  They<br/>\nwere busy playing Gameboy and my son asked if they could just sit on the<br/>\ncurb in front of the store and play while I got the few things in the store.<br/>\nI said &quot;sure&quot; but the friend decided it was a bad idea because somebody<br/>\nmight try to &quot;steal&quot; them.  My son looked at him like he was crazy but came<br/>\nalong into the store so his friend wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable.  This is in a<br/>\nsmall town of less than 5,000 people &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meplusfive@...\">meplusfive@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, July 12, 2004 8:06 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] playing with fire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new on the board and have been reading the posts.I can sure relate to<br/>\n&gt; your experience.<br/>\n&gt;   When I was a kids we used to use a magnifying glass all the time to<br/>\nstart<br/>\n&gt; fires on the sidewalk or burn up a leaf or piece of paper.

When I was a kid, we lived <br/>\nwhere trash was burned in barrels in 55 gallon drums [big oil cans], and <br/>\neventually the ashes were taken to the dump.  I loved that job above all.  I would <br/>\narrange the trash so that the cardboard tubes and wax-coated milk cartons and <br/>\nsuch carried smoke in various directions.  It was a boring day when I had no <br/>\nbuilding materials like that. &lt;g&gt;   And lighting it with one match was my <br/>\nspecialty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a big dirt yard and we could play with matches without getting in <br/>\ntrouble.   We&#39;d play with candles and warp or melt holes in 45 rpm records  <br/>\n(reject promos from a radio station my uncle managed) and hang them up for <br/>\ndecorations on the back porch.  (Stench was bad, but we did it outside).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years we&#39;ve done medieval/SCA camping.  Until the last few years <br/>\n(drought) we always had one of the best fires, with wooden benches around, and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhere the singing and story telling would end up.   Lately, fire restrictions <br/>\nmake it enclosed-fire-only, not much fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur current house has a fireplace, and though my husband is good with fires <br/>\noutside, one of his favorite stacking plans creates something that can make a <br/>\nstick roll out of the fire.  I&#39;ve pointed it out, but mostly I just keep the <br/>\ngrate close and when it&#39;s close to doing its collapse trick, I poke it all in.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t know why he so stubbornly clings to the idea that it will always <br/>\ncollapse in, when he sets it to roll out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill playing with fire, though, I melt leftover candle stuff (medieval <br/>\nfeasts generate candle wax) and wax some of the kindling.  It&#39;s a weird hobby, but <br/>\nmakes some of the easiest fire-starting ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery winter we buy marshmallows, and put them in a hanging basket by the <br/>\nfireplace with long forks from thrift stores.  Every spring, I throw out the <br/>\nhard, leftover marshmallows.  Less than half a bag a year.  They&#39;re too sweet for <br/>\nour kids&#39; tastes, and they don&#39;t have the desperation to play with fire that <br/>\nmade some kids my age love marshmallows.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173749108,"authorName":"Sharon Thomas","from":"&quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; &lt;meplusfive@...&gt;","profile":"meplusfive","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] playing with fire","postDate":"1089637574","msgId":96177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwRjI4Q0M2LjAwMDAwMS4wMzQ2MEBLSURTPg==","referencesHeader":"PGY2LjNjZWZhYTZkLjJlMjNlMzdmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":96175,"nextInTopic":96180,"prevInTime":96176,"nextInTime":96178,"topicId":96133,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new on the board and have been reading the posts.I can sure relate to\nyour experience.

How old were they when you started letting them be at <br/>\n<br/>\nhome alone.  How old were they when they stayed at home for just a <br/>\n<br/>\ncouple of hours to a whole afternoon or evening.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Holly was seven or eight before we left her all alone, and that would <br/>\nbe just to deliver another kid somewhere not far, or to go to the grocery <br/>\nstore for just a few things.  She wanted to stay.  It scared me, but she asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always made sure she had her dad&#39;s phone number at work, and a neighbor&#39;s <br/>\nphone number.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I would leave two kids alone (Kirby and Holly, usually) with some <br/>\ninstructions about what to do in case of a disagreement.  I feared the older <br/>\npicking on the younger, especially when it was Kirby and Marty.  Those were <br/>\nnever more than about an hour and a half or two, the oldest was (in the cases I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking of) ten or eleven, and they had phone numbers and usually a rented <br/>\nvideo or something to last as long as I would be gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I would come home I&#39;d spend some time talking with the child (or with <br/>\neach separately, if there was more than one) and just kinda casually try to <br/>\ntotally debrief them about anything that was a problem, or scary, or that they had <br/>\nneeded and not had, so that the next time I could make it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby started wanting to stay alone when he was about 12, instead of going to <br/>\nthe zoo or whatever.   He wanted to play video games undisturbed.  So we <br/>\nalways had the plan of where he would go if he got scared to be in the house, and <br/>\nwho he would call if he went to a public place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a Hollywood Video near our house, and a kid coutore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had a cellphone I wouldn&#39;t have worried much at all.  Moms with <br/>\ncellphones, I think, have more range.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my kids had a lot of freedom, I wasn&#39;t worried that they would play <br/>\nwith matches or anything crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA kid in Albuquerque burned down his apartment and all the neighbors were <br/>\nhomeless for a few days.  He was four, and lit firecrackers in the closet.   <br/>\nPeople were interviewed on the TV and they said it was just terrible parenting.  <br/>\nThe mom spoke and said firecrackers should be banned.  And that people should <br/>\nnever let kids get hold of lighters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if she had helped him light all the fireworks they owned on the 4th <br/>\nof July, he would have had it out of his system.  And he would&#39;ve known the <br/>\ncloset was a bad place to do it.  And he wouldn&#39;t have hidden fireworks from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe those aren&#39;t related, but as to why I wasn&#39;t afraid to leave my younger <br/>\nkids, it is.  I wasn&#39;t leaving them against their will.  If they had wanted <br/>\nto go with me they could&#39;ve.  If they WANTED to stay home, they needed to be <br/>\nways that would not scare me (or them), so they could have the privilege again <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t advise about leaving kids home against their will.  Depending how <br/>\nunhappy they are about it, things might not be safe and they might not be as safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3270790,"authorName":"Jennifer","from":"&quot;Jennifer&quot; &lt;jvaitkus@...&gt;","profile":"JenV72","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: A question about kids at home alone","postDate":"1089567725","msgId":96151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjcnU1ZCttYXZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjYwMWM0NjcwZiQ2NTNkNDBlMCQ2ZTMwMWM0MUBrYy5yci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":96143,"nextInTopic":96153,"prevInTime":96150,"nextInTime":96152,"topicId":96133,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for everyone s input!!

How old were they when you started letting them be at <br/>\nhome alone.  How old were they when they stayed at home for just a <br/>\ncouple of hours to a whole afternoon or evening.  I know it depends <br/>\non the child, but I am just interested in a general idea.<br/>\n   I am asking this question on this list because I feel that being <br/>\nable to be safe and responsible while home alone is definitely an <br/>\nunschooling issue....<br/>\n  Thanks for your input<br/>\n~Jennifer in NM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96457,"nextTopicId":96507}}
