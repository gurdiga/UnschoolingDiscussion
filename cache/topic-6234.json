Never give a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-132911792\">Giving choices is good but sometimes they are hard to come up with.  Just <br/>\nremember a rule is they need to have LOGICAL or NATURAL consequences.  Never <br/>\ngive a child a choice you yourself cannot follow through with.  I am not <br/>\npicking but the one mentioned was he would go to bed without a diaper.  The <br/>\nanswer you might get is OK mom no diaper for me.  Can you live with that.  We <br/>\nalways have the problem with being consistent and following through.  If you <br/>\nsay it, you need to mean it, and complete it, whatever it is.  <br/>\nI usually saw something that our son Sam (5) was doing to the dog and I would <br/>\nfind my first reaction to scream across the room.  But I need to stop and <br/>\nlook and see where I can get his attention and not his anger.  If you can <br/>\ncalmly come to his level and touch him gently and find out what you can do to <br/>\nhelp him play better with the animals.  Let them give you ideas.  If they are <br/>\ntoo young to verbalize then you give him suggestions.  Try not to over <br/>\nverbalize a situation because they can only handle so much info before they <br/>\nturn off.  Try other questions then WHY?  Even an adult usually cannot come <br/>\nup with a reason of why they did something.  The reason is usually too <br/>\ncomplex.  <br/>\nRemember if your cup is empty you cannot fill your children&#39;s cups.  Give <br/>\nyourself what you need so when you come to your children&#39;s needs you are not <br/>\nat the end of your rope.  When you are calm and happy you can give more to <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for such a long post but you spoke of a point I feel very strong about. <br/>\n <br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\nSome books and sites:<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\nLa Leche League has some information on what they call Loving Guidance.<br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lalecheleague.org/&quot;\">http://www.lalecheleague.org/&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: La Leche League <br/>\nInternational--Breastfeeding Information&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lalecheleague.org/\">http://www.lalecheleague.org/</a><br/>\n____________________________<br/>\nAlso there is information from a study group that is called Redirecting <br/>\nChildren&#39;s Behavior (RCB)  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.positiveparenting.com/&quot;\">http://www.positiveparenting.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Click <br/>\nhere: POSITIVE PARENTING (ON-LINE!)&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.positiveparenting.com/\">http://www.positiveparenting.com/</a><br/>\n________________________________________<br/>\nLove & Limits: Guidance Tools for Creative Parenting<br/>\nby Elizabeth Crary <br/>\nThis guide to the principles of loving guidance includes many concrete <br/>\nexamples.
