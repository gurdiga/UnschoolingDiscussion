If lateness is defined as there being a specific hard time for<br/>\narrival that will inconvenience others, then the fluid shopping trip time<br/>\njust seems way less urgent. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a teenager, I had a real problem with punctuality. It always<br/>\nseemed that there was something that would delay me, including external<br/>\nthings like the bus being late, and internal stuff - just dawdling or<br/>\nprocrastinating. If you arrived at school after assembly had begun, you had<br/>\nto report to the staff room and wait there. The teacher on duty was often my<br/>\nscience teacher, a genial woman, who was always interested in the<br/>\nfantastically unlikely combination of circumstances that led to my late<br/>\narrivals. Finally the headmistress put me in charge of unlocking the hall<br/>\nand supervising the chair arranging for the daily morning assembly -<br/>\nrequiring me to be there half an hour before the rest of the school. I<br/>\nremember feeling astonished. I was never late for school again, including<br/>\nafter that year was up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, lest it seem that my issue was magically cured, I continued to be<br/>\nlousily unpunctual for social events with my friends - whose patience was<br/>\nbeyond saintly as I now look back. I don&#39;t know if it was me testing their<br/>\naffection, or just striving to be in control of SOMETHING in my life or<br/>\nwhat, but I just seemed incapable of getting to  anywhere on time - and I<br/>\nnever felt it was my fault. I was always apologetic, but I felt at the time<br/>\nthat being late was something that happened to me. Finally my friends - a<br/>\ngroup of about 6 other girls - colluded to give me the start time of an<br/>\nevent an hour early - and by some miracle I was on time and had to wait an<br/>\nhour! Having a sense of justice, I was in no way angry about it, but I did<br/>\ntake it as a call to change. I decided that I just had to face up to being<br/>\nan unpunctual person, and therefore would have to work constantly and<br/>\nforever to not be late for stuff. The only way was to plan to get there<br/>\nearlier, so I would be on time.<br/>\n<br/>\n25 years later it is still a struggle to get to things like park days with a<br/>\nfluid start time, early. And for events with a hard start time I plan in an<br/>\nextra early leave-the-house time, and use various organizational tricks like<br/>\nprepping the night before, and counting back from the leave time. For<br/>\nexample allow 15 minutes for putting together a food bag, x amount of time<br/>\nfor shower, tidy kitchen 10 mins etc, until I can schedule the time I have<br/>\nto start getting ready (ie stop reading my e-mail). This is especially<br/>\ncrucial for catching planes. My husband is fanatically punctual, hates being<br/>\nlate, since lateness as practiced by some of his family members was a pose<br/>\nfor creating as much disturbance and attention getting as possible, not to<br/>\nmention being entirely self centered. I hope Jayn takes after him instead of<br/>\nme when she gets old enough to have a clearer grasp of the time of day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this will help with your teenager, except to note that in my<br/>\ncase, it took fairly drastic action on the part of other people who<br/>\nevidently cared about me, for me to accept that I actually had a problem<br/>\nthat definitely was impacting my life and the life of others in a negative<br/>\nway. I was the one who ended up creating the solutions for the problem - ie<br/>\nstrategies that worked for me to get punctual. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

But try to keep focused on<br/>\nthe real problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus on the fact that it&#39;s okay for her to stay home but that if she *does*<br/>\nwant to go she needs to be aware that others have goals they&#39;re trying to<br/>\nmeet also: getting somewhere on time and not having to wait around to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Kat, who&#39;s 12, I have found bringing her clothes to her works because<br/>\nher not being ready is usually caused by asking her to interrupt something<br/>\ninteresting to do something that isn&#39;t as interesting. (When it&#39;s something<br/>\nshe wants to do, she usually has no problems focusing on getting ready.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter&#39;s probably too old for that and too interested in picking out<br/>\nher own stuff, but it might be an idea for someone else.

When *her* goal is going with you -- that is on<br/>\nthose times when she&#39;d be upset if she was left behind -- focus on what you<br/>\ncan do to help her reach that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys can talk it out and come up with some plans. One way that might<br/>\nhelp her is if you give her 3 alerts: a first alert that reminds her to<br/>\nfinish up what she&#39;s doing, a second alert that reminds her to stop what<br/>\nshe&#39;s doing and get ready and a 10 minute alert that means she should grab<br/>\nany last minute things she needs and come down now because the bus is<br/>\ndeparting in 10 minutes whether everyone is on board or not. It needs to be<br/>\npresented as a method for her to help herself, not a way for you to control<br/>\nher. The alerts are for *her* to accomplish her goal of getting out in time.<br/>\nYour role isn&#39;t to make her do any of the getting ready.

I can&#39;t say she would make us late though.<br/>\nI planned ahead and even though she was already *old enough* I would help<br/>\nand remind her of the time if we needed to get somewhere at a certain time.<br/>\nParty, shopping, etc. no, but organized events that had a start time, yes.<br/>\nOne thing she did on her own was set her clock 15 minutes ahead. Although<br/>\nshe knew it was fast, in the heat of getting ready quickly, she would just<br/>\nlook at the clock and actually forget it was fast and hurry herself along. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t say we ever got mad at her or even thought about leaving her behind.<br/>\n(okay maybe my husband did &lt;BG&gt;) But I did talk to her about the importance<br/>\nof the event for the other people. Also about how it made me feel to be late<br/>\nor hurry. I&#39;m pretty much late myself. But when something is scheduled and<br/>\nit&#39;s not fashionable to be late, I make sure we&#39;re there. So I guess Tara<br/>\nknew I wouldn&#39;t be feeling bad unless it was important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember the last time I actually got her up or reminded her about<br/>\nthe time for anything. She&#39;s always on time for work and if she&#39;s late for<br/>\nschool, it&#39;s because she wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger ones dawdled. I still have one that does. The others grew out of<br/>\nit as I feel like she will too. I just start earlier with them and help<br/>\nalong the way with whatever I can.
