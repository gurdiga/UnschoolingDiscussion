Our son has a choice where every cent of<br/>\nit goes.  As you might recall, the 10% to save and 10% to &quot;things bigger<br/>\nthan self&quot; was &quot;OUR deal with him&quot;.  He was part of that decision, and we<br/>\nshowed him what 10% of his money would look like.  Those amounts are<br/>\nprinciples my husband and I live by, and Tim, wanting to be like his<br/>\nparents, like those amounts, too.  (The child is 6.  He still wants to be<br/>\nlike his parents.  It&#39;s nice.)  Since we as a family believe in supporting<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; beyond our home, he chooses to whom his church/charity money goes.<br/>\nAnd his long-term savings are for *his* expenses; however, putting a set<br/>\namount aside each week helps him see how to plan for future needs without<br/>\nlosing a great deal of today&#39;s money.  It&#39;s been impressive to him that so<br/>\nlittle money each week (.50 euro cents) turns into a lot in not very long.<br/>\n(That&#39;s a worthwhile lesson, I think, especially considering the number of<br/>\nfolks I know that have absolutely no savings.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it&#39;s about learning to manage money.  It&#39;s not about my control of<br/>\nhis money, but about his control of his money.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41011,"nextTopicId":41017}}
