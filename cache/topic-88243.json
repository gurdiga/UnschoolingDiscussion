The list is here so you can bring your questions and assumptions to it and have them answered or challenged. At least that&#39;s how I see it. I think it&#39;s great that you bring these things here not only for yourself but because they make others like me question how I do things. Your post on your daughter wanted to dance has had me thinking since I read it.

One little four year old gorl (cute as could be) said <br/>\nduring the show that she wanted to dance.  We let her and she stood <br/>\nup there in front of everyone and just started moving her feet <br/>\naround. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could have been so embarrassing was made into a really <br/>\npowerfully empowering moment for that little girl.  Instead of anyone <br/>\nridculing or acting embarrassed, Sandra started playing the perfect <br/>\nsong for the movement on her recorder and everyone joined in <br/>\nclapping.  It was the highlight of the show!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt other HUG conferences we&#39;ve had kids get up and then sit back <br/>\ndown, unable to perform but no made fun of them.  Sometimes they were <br/>\nencouraged and went through with their act.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the participants didn&#39;t have a traditional talent.  One kid <br/>\ncould puff his chin out like a frog.  David Albert does this funny <br/>\ncontortion thing with his arms and tells a great story with it.  Some <br/>\nhave shown art work and there are always lots of skits.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, how I wish I could have been in environment like that as a <br/>\nchild!<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Elizabeth Roberts <br/>\n&lt;mamabethuscg@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m glad to know that I&#39;m wrong about it all....!
