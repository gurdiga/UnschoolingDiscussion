The Clerk was obviously a<br>&gt; \n  career&nbsp; woman, poised, efficient, and possessed of a \n  high-sounding<br>&gt; title like &quot;Official Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town \n  Registrar.&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;And what is your occupation?&quot; she probed. What made me \n  say it, I do<br>&gt; not know. The words simply popped out. &quot;I&#39;m a Research \n  Associate in the<br>&gt; field of Child Development and Human \n  Relations.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair, \n  and&nbsp; looked up as<br>&gt; though she had not heard right.&nbsp; I \n  repeated the title slowly,<br>&gt; emphasizing the most significant words. \n  Then I stared with wonder as&nbsp; my<br>&gt; pompous<br>&gt; pronouncement \n  was written in bold, black ink on the official<br>&gt; questionnaire.<br>&gt; \n  &quot;Might&nbsp; I ask,&quot; said the clerk with new interest, &quot;just what you do \n  in<br>&gt; your field?&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Coolly, without any trace of fluster \n  in my voice, I heard myself reply,<br>&gt; &quot;I&nbsp; have a continuing program \n  of research (what mother doesn&#39;t) in the<br>&gt; laboratory and in the field \n  (normally I would have said indoors and<br>&gt; out).<br>&gt; I&#39;m working for \n  my Masters (the whole darned family) and already<br>&gt; Have four&nbsp; \n  credits (all daughters). &quot;Of course, the job is one of the<br>&gt; most \n  Demanding&nbsp; in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?) and \n  I<br>often<br>&gt; work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it).&nbsp; But the job \n  is more<br>&gt; challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards \n  are in<br>&gt; satisfaction rather than just money.&quot;&nbsp; There was an \n  increasing note of<br>&gt; respect in the clerk&#39;s<br>&gt; voice as she&nbsp; \n  completed the form, stood up, and personally ushered me to<br>the<br>&gt; \n  door.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous \n  new career, I<br>&gt; Was greeted by my lab assistants - ages 13, 7, and \n  3.&nbsp; Upstairs&nbsp; I<br>&gt;&nbsp; could Hear our new experimental model \n  (6 months) in the child-development<br>&gt;&nbsp; program, testing out a new \n  vocal pattern.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; I felt triumphant!&nbsp; I had scored a \n  beat on bureaucracy! And I had gone<br>&gt;&nbsp; On the official records as \n  someone more distinguished and indispensable<br>&gt;&nbsp; To mankind than \n  &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; Motherhood...what a glorious \n  career.
