The book is titled &quot;Team Work: How to Help <br/>\nYour Husband Make More Money So You Can Be a Stay-At-Home Mom.&quot; That <br/>\nsounded too &quot;little woman behind the successful man&quot; for me. On my <br/>\nfirst skim through it though, I changed my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most frequently asked homeschool questions these days is <br/>\n&quot;How can I homeschool and still work to help support my family?&quot; One <br/>\nanswer is that you can help your husband (or wife) make more money so <br/>\nyou can stay home full time. And to do that, it takes teamwork, just <br/>\nlike the title says.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcise and easy to read, &quot;Team Work&quot; gives women (or men) lots of <br/>\nideas for increasing the family bread winner&#39;s income. She starts <br/>\nwith assessing his skills, then moves on through furthering his <br/>\neducation to finding jobs to interviewing and landing a new, <br/>\nhigher-paying job. Other chapters discuss networking, <br/>\nself-employment, alternative sources for extra income and a political <br/>\nlittle chapter at the end on the value of SAHMs. The information is <br/>\nbacked up at the end of each chapter by relevant websites and books.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough &quot;Team Work&quot; is written for wives who want to help their <br/>\nhusbands, it could just as easily apply to husbands who want to stay <br/>\nat home or parents of young adults who want to start a career. <br/>\nAvailable at your local or online bookstore.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>\n<br/>\nASK CAROL<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to apologize for a confusing situation, and clear up a <br/>\nmisunderstanding about my column Ask Carol. I wear two hats for <br/>\nHEM-one is the editor hat for this newsletter; the other is a <br/>\ncolumnist hat for Home Education Magazine, the original print version <br/>\nthat&#39;s been around for over 20 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout every other month, I ask people to send me questions and I <br/>\npromise to answer as many as I can in future columns. Some of you <br/>\nassumed I would answer them here, in this newsletter. In fact, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t answer them here, where the space is just too tiny for my BIG <br/>\nadvice. I do answer them in every issue of Home Education Magazine <br/>\nthough, and if you&#39;re at all curious, I&#39;ve put subscription <br/>\ninformation at the end of the newsletter. A couple of them are online <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/issue_index.html)\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/issue_index.html)</a>, but most of <br/>\nthem you have to read in the magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t really a plug for the magazine though, although it IS the <br/>\nbest homeschool magazine on the newsstand. This is another plea for <br/>\nquestions. I really like to get your questions-any questions at all. <br/>\nEven if you think your question is stupid and you&#39;re the only one who <br/>\nhas your particular problem (it&#39;s probably not true). If you don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a question, send me something funny in the form of a question. <br/>\nSomebody once asked me if she could homeschool if she has a tattoo <br/>\nand rides a Harley. Her answer got more than half the column.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, help me out with that other hat, and send me your questions. I <br/>\neven have a special email address: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:askcarol@...\">askcarol@...</a> . Of <br/>\ncourse, I don&#39;t promise I can answer every question (Especially if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use <br/>\nit for a column or not. What are you waiting for?

We <br/>\ndecided to try with our babies, envisioning our babies reading very <br/>\nyoung and growing up very smart and well educated. Neither of our <br/>\nbabies took to the program well, even though we tried it with them <br/>\nagain and again. My son, Chris, refused to read at two years, then at <br/>\nthree years. I gradually tried more traditional ways of teaching him <br/>\nletters and sounds. Surely he would read by five years of age. But <br/>\nnot Chris. Maybe by the time he was six years old, or by seven? But <br/>\nChris refused to be forced or cajoled into reading. By now his <br/>\nfriends were learning to read in school, but Chris still couldn&#39;t <br/>\nread. He struggled to decipher simple words and he hated trying to <br/>\nread because it was so frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was holding my breath the whole time. I was battling tremendous <br/>\nself-doubt. I must be an awful mother. Some folks advised me to take <br/>\nChris to specialists, test his hearing, eyesight, cognitive <br/>\nabilities, look into reading labs for him. Deep in my soul, those <br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel right and I never took Chris to any of those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then the miracle happened. Right about his ninth birthday, <br/>\nreading clicked in his mind and he just began reading. Within a month <br/>\nhe was reading easily at his grade level. Within a year he had read <br/>\nevery book on airplanes at the public library. The librarian, who <br/>\nthought he was a wonderful and precocious child because he read so <br/>\nmuch, gave him a special &quot;adult&quot; library card, so he could begin <br/>\nchecking out adult books about airplanes.<br/>\nI breathed a sigh of relief. The muscles in my stomach could finally <br/>\nrelax. I could let my shoulders drop and I could unfurrow my brow. <br/>\nOne of my kids, at long last, was reading.<br/>\nBut there were two more kids behind Chris...&quot; ~ Carol Rice, an <br/>\nexcerpt from the feature article at unschooling.com ~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling.com offers a free monthly newsletter, message boards, <br/>\nweekly essays, an email list and more just for unschoolers.
