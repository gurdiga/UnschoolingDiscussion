Poverty elsewhere is not just scarcity of amenities or income <br/>\nbut scarcity of food, education and health care. And security as is the <br/>\ncase of not just most African countries but all the third world. Only <br/>\nthose with money can afford to pay their own police force (aka security <br/>\nguards with real weapons and license to kill).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are really poor you learn early on how to not just tend cattle <br/>\nbut tend to yourself --with food, clothes and plain old hustle.

And girls of this age are carrying<br/>\naround their smaller siblings on their back, or pounding corn, or whatever.<br/>\nI think our conception of childhood is largely a modern fabrication. Most<br/>\nkids around the world don&#39;t get this amazing 18 year period to just be kids.<br/>\nThey have big responsbilities at a very young age, and are expected to do a<br/>\nlarge part of the family work as soon as they&#39;re able. In many cultures,<br/>\nwhen a child is weaned they move out into the world of big people. Those<br/>\nfirst 4 - 7 years are all that they get to really *just* be a kid. In some<br/>\ncultures if they&#39;re males they never do speak directly to their mothers<br/>\nagain after they&#39;re weaned.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow all that being said, I&#39;m not going to enslave my oldest or think he<br/>\nought to grow up too soon or tell him he can&#39;t speak to me. For good or bad,<br/>\nwe&#39;re living in the culture we are right now, and I value the fact that I<br/>\ncan give my kids the gift of a childhood that&#39;s relatively free from<br/>\nconcern. There&#39;s nothing like the day we spent yesterday, glorious sunshine<br/>\nand we&#39;re out camping. The kids are playing with their friends in the mud<br/>\nand sand and a creek and it&#39;s a school day in the middle of a workweek so<br/>\nthe campground is empty!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71456,"nextTopicId":71408}}
