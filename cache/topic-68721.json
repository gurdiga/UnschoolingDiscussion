What would happen?  What would she<br/>\nchoose?  Pretend it&#39;s Saturday tomorrow, and the day after, and the day<br/>\nafter that, too.  Heck, figure it&#39;s Saturday for the next month!  I dare you<br/>\nto try and   keep her from learning anything in the next month!  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68673,"nextTopicId":68716}}
