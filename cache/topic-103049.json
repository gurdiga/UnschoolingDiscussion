They should call <br/>\nthem &quot;mechanical writing&quot;...if you plug in the formula, you&#39;re <br/>\nguaranteed to pass.  Unfortunately, &quot;success&quot; in other college <br/>\nsubjects that require essays rely on knowing that formula.  I&#39;m glad <br/>\nI don&#39;t have to think about that now, we&#39;re about 6 years away from <br/>\nworrying about college.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis post really touched me though because it reminded me <br/>\nof &quot;seahorses&quot; or why we started homeschooling ALL of our children.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t post much, I just wanted to share this for some reason so I <br/>\nhope you&#39;ll bear with me!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we started homeschooling (mind you, before our transition to <br/>\nthe unschooling lifestyle), we started out hsing our eldest dd, then <br/>\nin 5th grade and bored out of her mind (and sick of the BS).  We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t plan on taking our 3rd grade dd out...she was happy and doing <br/>\nwell (6yods was at home already).  But slowly she, too, became <br/>\ninterested in hsing, but I put her off because I felt she was <br/>\na &quot;better fit&quot; for school.  Again, this was in the beginning of our <br/>\nhsing journey, before all the little epiphanies about education, <br/>\nlifestyle, etc. started happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changed my mind about hsing all my kids was the <br/>\ninfamous &quot;SEAHORSE&quot; report.<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica is so bright and inquisitive (and from a former schoolish <br/>\npoint of view, she was considered an A+advanced learner), but she is <br/>\na messy writer, specifically in cursive.  Always has been and <br/>\nprobably always will be!  Not illegible by any means, just not <br/>\npretty!  She prints GREAT, but cursive becomes mandatory for use in <br/>\nreports in 3rd grade.  Her teacher handed out an assignment where <br/>\nthey had to choose an animal of the ocean, write a pretty detailed <br/>\nreport, including illustrations, photos, etc. and assemble it like a <br/>\nbook.  In cursive.  Jess was so psyched because she loves <br/>\nseahorses...and likes drawing and creating books...a perfect <br/>\nassignment for her...she started going to the library and putting <br/>\nthis report together a month before it was due.  She read books, <br/>\nvisited websites and wrote a good report that we wrote and rewrote <br/>\ntogether (for neatness and spelling as required) several times.  <br/>\nQuite frankly, her zest for it was starting to drive me a little <br/>\ncrazy (but in a good way!).  She was really proud of the report and <br/>\nhad a lot of fun doing it!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the report was graded, she received a C-. Pretty bad for her in <br/>\ngeneral..she was an A student (although the ramifications of that <br/>\ngrade were on a much more personal level).  The teacher told me in a <br/>\nnote that although it was A+ work, Jessica&#39;s handwriting was so <br/>\nmessy that it took away from the overall &quot;value&quot; of the report.  <br/>\nMind you, it wasn&#39;t unreadable (and her illustrations, etc. were <br/>\ngreat), teacher just felt that a third grader should have better <br/>\ntechnical penmanship skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was SO pissed, told the teacher that it was a shame that at the <br/>\n3RD GRADE LEVEL that form was valued so much over content.  She <br/>\nagreed, but said that was the way it is!  Jessica needed to write in <br/>\ncursive and write well at that. AS IF CURSIVE HAS ANYTHING TO DO <br/>\nWITH WRITING.  But she made it pretty clear that it would affect her <br/>\nsuccess as a student from that point on, her &quot;unpretty&quot; cursive.  <br/>\nAnd I believe that to be partly true.  At home I tried to downplay <br/>\nit...tell Jessica that I didn&#39;t care about the grade, I was happy <br/>\nshe enjoyed seahorses and thanked her for all she taught me about <br/>\nthem.  And I meant it...I was really upset...not about the grade but <br/>\nabout the fact that the teacher put so little value in the learning <br/>\nthat took place (and the love of the learning).  She placed more <br/>\nvalue in penmanship.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my daughter was still so upset about the grade.  She didn&#39;t see <br/>\nit as the report being graded, she saw it as HER being graded.  I <br/>\nreally saw a change in her and how she felt about learning on that <br/>\nday, in that moment that she received a C-.  It&#39;s funny how one <br/>\nsignificant moment kind of stands out like that.  I swear I saw my <br/>\ndd lose something very important, some part of her innocence maybe, <br/>\nsomething intangible.  Maybe I&#39;m overreacting, but at the least I <br/>\nbelieved that I couldn&#39;t hope that she enjoy learning and continue <br/>\ndown a path that doesn&#39;t really value the joy of learning.  I just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t see how I could do both...encourage her joy and also force <br/>\nher to be successful by the schools limiting standards.  I knew I&#39;d <br/>\nhave to compromise something. And it felt hypocritical to say that <br/>\nthe grade doesn&#39;t matter but then send her back to be graded some <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jess came home the next week.  Eventually we all started to <br/>\nbelieve in and embrace the unschooling lifestyle (which basically <br/>\nreflected every other part of our life outside of school).  There <br/>\nare books and games and movies and crafts everywhere.  Literally, <br/>\nthere&#39;s sh*t everywhere!!!:))  It&#39;s complete creative chaos all the <br/>\ntime.  My oldest dd finds more relevance in Green Day&#39;s &quot;American <br/>\nIdiot&quot; than she does in a social studies text book, my youngest dd <br/>\nis constantly cutting up old clothes and making new designs, and my <br/>\nson (6) is obsessed with Xbox, skateboarding and his electric guitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going through a box of &quot;memories&quot; the other day, including <br/>\nmany old school projects and papers, and I realized that I was <br/>\nreally selling my kids short before..entrusting them to <br/>\nschool...they are so much more interesting and intelligent and <br/>\ncreative than to be represented by a bunch of xeroxed worksheets <br/>\nwith A+ stickers on them.  They were so limited before, to learning <br/>\nwhat was necessary and appropriate.  Now they learn everything, all <br/>\nthe time, even when we don&#39;t seem to be doing anything at all.  It&#39;s <br/>\npretty cool, when you sit back and think about it.  I thought about <br/>\nthrowing that box of school stuff out, as some sort of a symbolic <br/>\ngesture:), but I can&#39;t...partly because I&#39;m not into symbolic <br/>\ngestures...but mainly because I can see my kids grubby little paw <br/>\nprints on some things..and there were some moments of genuine <br/>\nhappiness in creating or achieving (however misguided) these little <br/>\nitems they handed to me with such a happy shiny look on their faces, <br/>\nmostly from the younger years when school was still a little fun.  <br/>\nBefore they had to grow up and get serious in 3rd grade or so!  But <br/>\nnow a lot of our memories are living memories, not based <br/>\non &quot;accomplishment&quot;, which is a really wonderful thing and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nrequire a storage space.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank G-d for Seahorses!
