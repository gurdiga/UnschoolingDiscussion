Last year&#39;s front-page headlines were filled with Big Business <br/>\nscandals and barrels of op-ed indignation about capitalist greed. But when <br/>\nteachers&#39; union officials plunder their members&#39; coffers in Enronic <br/>\nproportions, the media go . . . AWOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently read a nauseating FBI affidavit filed last month in support of <br/>\nsearch and seizure warrants for three teachers&#39; union officials in <br/>\nWashington, D.C. The accused villains under federal investigation are former <br/>\nWashington Teachers Union President Barbara Bullock, her aide, Gwen Hemphill, <br/>\nand her treasurer, James Baxter. All three are prominent cronies of D.C. <br/>\nMayor Anthony Williams and key players in the local Democratic machine. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe union extracts nearly $700 a month per teacher from its 5,500-member <br/>\ngroup. The Trump-spending trio and several others are suspected of embezzling <br/>\nmore than $2 million in member dues dating back to 1995. Here is just one <br/>\nexcerpt of the FBI affidavit detailing Bullock&#39;s selfless expenditures: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Among (her) purchases were: a $20,000 mink coat, along with other mink coats <br/>\nthat . . . have been stored at Miller Furs in Chevy Chase, Maryland; nearly <br/>\n$500,000 in custom-made clothing from a Baltimore clothing maker known as Van <br/>\nStyle . . . more than $9,000 at retailer Bloomingdales; more than $9,000 for <br/>\nclothing and accessories from a Florida vendor known as Body Scentre Limited; <br/>\nmore than $11,000 in purchases from a retailer known as Friedman&#39;s Shoes in <br/>\nAtlanta, Georgia; more than $5,000 to Galt Brothers Jewelry in Washington, <br/>\nD.C.; more than $5,000 to Graffiti AudioVideo for electronic equipment; more <br/>\nthan $12,000 at retailer Hecht Company; more than $3,000 at the Hermes <br/>\nBoutique in Vienna, Virginia . . . &quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWait, there&#39;s more: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(M)ore than $5,000 for bedding and a desk pad from the Horchow Collection; <br/>\nmore than $6,000 to vendor J. Crew; more than $15,000 . . . for St. John Knit <br/>\napparel; more than $4,000 for merchandise from Little Switzerland JNU, in <br/>\nJuneau, Alaska; more than $60,000 to MS Rau Antiques in New Orleans, <br/>\nLouisiana (including $57,000 for a 288-piece Tiffany sterling silver set); <br/>\nmore than $17,000 to Miller Furs; more than $150,000 at retailer <br/>\nNeiman-Marcus; more than $50,000 at retailer Nordstrom; more than $4,000 at <br/>\nbeauty salon Oriental Oasis; more than $25,000 for services of the Parkway <br/>\nCustom Dry Cleaners in Chevy Chase, Maryland; more than $9,000 to Ramee Art <br/>\nGallery in Washington, D.C.; more than $40,000 at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue; <br/>\nmore than $50,000 at a vendor known as Snazzy Limited in Orange Park, <br/>\nFlorida; more than $4,000 at the St. John Boutique in Beverly Hills, <br/>\nCalifornia, and New York, New York; more than $2,500 for china or crystal <br/>\nfrom The Lenox Shop in Williamsburg, Virginia, and Prince William, Virginia; <br/>\nmore than $6,000 in gourmet kitchen equipment from retailer Williams-Sonoma; <br/>\nalmost $4,000 to jeweler Tiffany & Co.; more than $20,000 to the Atlanta <br/>\ngallery of the artist William Tolliver; and more than $7,000 to Wagner <br/>\nOpticians.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBullock spread the wealth to friends and family. According to the FBI agent, <br/>\nher sister received &quot;a two-door, French, hand-painted armoire&quot; from an <br/>\nAlexandria, Va., antiques dealer, Tradition de France. Bullock&#39;s driver and <br/>\nerrand boy, Leroy Holmes, received checks &quot;totaling in excess of $1,000,000, <br/>\nwhich he converted to cash to pay himself more than $90,000 per year, plus <br/>\nadditional funds to maintain and pay for personal vehicles, and provide cash <br/>\nto others.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nBullock&#39;s aide, Hemphill, also shared her booty with family, including <br/>\n$20,000 in African art; a $12,999 50&quot; plasma, flat-screen television; and a <br/>\n$950 handbag from Neiman-Marcus. Union Treasurer Baxter is suspected of <br/>\nrampant book-cooking to hide his union income from the IRS. The trio also <br/>\n&quot;enlisted the aid of an accountant to help them hide the misconduct,&quot; <br/>\naccording to investigators. Also under scrutiny: Interim Union President <br/>\nEsther S. Hankerson, who has held leadership positions since 1994 and whose <br/>\ncredit-card use is reportedly being probed. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the union&#39;s rent, phone bills and health premiums for retired <br/>\nteachers went unpaid. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a sickening and all-too-familiar case of education corruption <br/>\ninvolving the looting of compulsory union dues. Rank-and-file teachers have <br/>\nfought across the country for the right to stop union tyrants from siphoning <br/>\nmoney from their paychecks for political lobbying and personal <br/>\naggrandizement. Big Labor&#39;s accounting system is a sham. But you won&#39;t read <br/>\nabout this scandal on the editorial pages of The New York Times. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, the looters did it &quot;for the children,&quot; right? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n©2002 Creators Syndicate, Inc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:malkin@...\">malkin@...</a>%3Fsubject=TownHall.com%20Reader%20Comment&quot;&gt;Contact Michelle Malkin&lt;/A&gt; | &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BIOS/cbmalkin.html&quot;\">http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BIOS/cbmalkin.html&quot;</a>&gt;Read her biography&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ntownhall.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54462,"nextTopicId":54481}}
