(He wanted to know how many seconds it was<br/>\nuntil 11am.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a minute to understand what he wanted and figure out whether I was jumbling the units.  I gave him the answer.  (I didn&#39;t think he really wanted me to explain the &quot;unit analysis&quot; part.  I&#39;ll save that for another day.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen he got playful and said &quot;I wonder what the math after the aftermath is?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he did this, he was undressed and batting a balloon down the hall.  I figure this is worth extra unschooling &quot;style&quot; points &#39;cause it included (a) freedom of expression in clothing, (b) whimsical kinesthetic stuff, and (c) word play.  (My favorite!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine him in a classroom!  And if he had to wear a uniform and put the balloon down, and answer questions instead of asking them, I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35065,"nextTopicId":35069}}
