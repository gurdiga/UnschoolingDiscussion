It is the most informative thing I have<br/>\nread so far on how to go about the daily routine.  I am going to print this<br/>\nand try to use it as a guide.  It sounds so good.  I love the way the whole<br/>\nfamily fits into it.  I like the idea of the family being involved, then it<br/>\ntruly is a lifestyle and that is exactly what I want.  I have really started<br/>\nincluding the two year old in the last couple of days and it is great.  I<br/>\nfigured he would be too young to do anything constructive with but we have<br/>\nbeen having a great time doing things I normally don&#39;t let him  do much of.<br/>\nLast night we had to go to Vegas and my son had to get his annual drug test<br/>\nfor the union (they have to do it every year on or near their birthday to<br/>\nget a current &quot;clean&quot; card. ).  The children and I waited for him in and<br/>\naround the car for an hour and I thought it would really be a drag, but we<br/>\nhad a ball. WE played catch, we talked about the things surrounding us in<br/>\nview, we laughed a lot and the time went so fast.  When my son came out and<br/>\napologized for taking so long we told him we didn&#39;t care because we were<br/>\nhaving a great time.  He at first thought I was being sarcastic then<br/>\nrealized I wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get so tired some times that I forget to have fun with them like I did my<br/>\nkids when they (and I) were young.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t know what a help it is to get your routine run-down.  When I<br/>\nstarted homeschooling I asked homeschooler support groups for a &quot;run down&quot;<br/>\non their routine because I was unsure how to go about it but not one person<br/>\ngave me any insight.

I really feel that unschooling is<br/>\ngoing to be our way of life.  I have been thinking of tactful ways to<br/>\npresent some of these ideas to my son bit by bit.

I hope that you realize your posts have really delighted me,<br/>\n&gt; and that you will not leave.  I can usually tell the attitude or content<br/>\n&gt; by the first sentence of a post and will just delete it if it isn&#39;t for<br/>\n&gt; me.  Every one has something to offer.  Your questions are very<br/>\n&gt; thought-provoking and your comments interesting.  Even though I started<br/>\n&gt; unschooling in the Fall, the way we unschool has changed considerably<br/>\n&gt; since then as my understanding has changed.  The way we do things at my<br/>\n&gt; house is as we&#39;re getting ready for the day we talk about what we want to<br/>\n&gt; do-myself included- and where we want to go-usually this has nothing to<br/>\n&gt; do with subjects and everything to do with interesting, fun things.  Then<br/>\n&gt; we write it all down so everyone gets included.  At the start, I<br/>\n&gt; interviewed my children to hear what they are interested in.  I wrote it<br/>\n&gt; down and posted it on the wall to remind myself to be on the lookout for<br/>\n&gt; things that my kids would be interested in.  Each week we have a family<br/>\n&gt; meeting to discuss problems or ideas the children or I have.  These are<br/>\n&gt; not necessarily academic.  I have just started making a sort of newspaper<br/>\n&gt; to document what the children do from week to week.  I intend to save<br/>\n&gt; these for future reference, and as documentation that they are learning.<br/>\n&gt; We go to the library at least twice a week so they can use the<br/>\n&gt; educational computer games or the internet.  We usually check out lots of<br/>\n&gt; books too.  My three boys have math textbooks that they at first thought<br/>\n&gt; they had to do because they weren&#39;t de-schooled yet.  But now, they just<br/>\n&gt; use it as a reference book when they have a question.  They write and<br/>\n&gt; email relatives and friends.  They experiment with magnets, plants and<br/>\n&gt; draw and write books.  They build things and make plans and know I will<br/>\n&gt; be there to help them and support them.  The children are delighted that<br/>\n&gt; I listen to them and to their interests and help them find ways to<br/>\n&gt; explore these things.  They play a lot of board games.  We go out of<br/>\n&gt; doors a lot, down by the river or up to the mountains when we have gas.<br/>\n&gt; The coast is an hour or so away.  I know that if I let them play, they go<br/>\n&gt; sort of in spurts of devouring different subjects, then a rest.  I<br/>\n&gt; realize that this is how I learn, too.  My daughter has had very little<br/>\n&gt; of my input about math- maybe around fifteen minutes of introducing<br/>\n&gt; little interesting things to her- and the rest she has figured out.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how any more than I know how she learned to talk and walk.<br/>\n&gt; They figure things out as their curiosity leads them to ask questions and<br/>\n&gt; explore.  If I show them something and they are not interested, I drop<br/>\n&gt; it.  If they are interested, they carry it.  Often they come to me with<br/>\n&gt; questions and we explore it together.  I add it on the list of interests<br/>\n&gt; so I remember to look for it later.<br/>\n&gt; Is any of this of use to you?<br/>\n&gt; Is Chaelene involved in 4-H?<br/>\n&gt; Bonni<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
