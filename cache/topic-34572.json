A lot of people call themselves Christian.  But do you live up to all the ideals?  No, you struggle and hope your getting it right.

We believe in the words.  But that doesn&#39;t mean were perfect!  We never will be perfect buddhists or christians, or whatever.  So why do we have this need to be *perfect* unschoolers.
