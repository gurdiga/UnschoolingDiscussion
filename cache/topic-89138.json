So your son<br/>\nhas to read in order to watch the movie?<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly all movies, foreign *and* English language, on DVD have subtitles in<br/>\nEnglish. (And usually French or Spanish and sometimes a few other languages.<br/>\nAnd sometimes they have other language tracks so you can hear it dubbed in<br/>\nanother language and have the subtitles in English.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you only have a VCR -- BTW, DVD players are under a $100 now -- lots of<br/>\ntapes (and TV shows for that matter) have subtitles. You might have to play<br/>\naround with the menu on your TV or VCR to turn them on but they are widely<br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your kids can show you ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you&#39;re asking specifically for subtitled foreign films on *tape*,<br/>\nthat&#39;s going to be harder. Most foreign movies -- probably especially kid<br/>\nfriendly ones -- are released dubbed because there&#39;s a larger market for<br/>\ndubbed movies that subtitled movies. Manufacturers don&#39;t have to choose<br/>\nbetween subtitle and dub with DVD. They can offer both plus lots more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone suggested Totoro but all Miyazaki&#39;s movies are great. Princess<br/>\nMononoke is more violent (it&#39;s PG-13 I think) but Kiki and Totoro and<br/>\nSpirited Away are all wonderful.
