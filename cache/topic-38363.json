So what I do is take some <br/>\nhula-hoops, an egg timer and a radio into the room with me. I say &quot;Now its <br/>\ntime for our clean up contest!&quot; then I throw the hoops into the middle of the <br/>\nmess and say Ready? Set? Go! and turn on the radio and flip the egg timer <br/>\nover. Then the kids have three minutes to see who can pick up all the <br/>\ntoys/clothes in their hoop the fastest. The music is to get them going. When <br/>\nthe timer is up, most times the mess inside the hoop is gone and the kids are <br/>\nclamoring at me to have another contest! I have on occasion, gotten a whole <br/>\nroom cleaned this way. Most times though the kids are ready to quit after two <br/>\nor three tries. That is okay with me because we don&#39;t have the fights and <br/>\narguments, and no one had to pick up more than the others. (They will fight <br/>\nover that! I used to get &quot;She didn&#39;t have as many things to clean as me!&quot; <br/>\narguments) There is no *reward* just the satisfaction of the race! Then later <br/>\nthat day we will go back with the hoops and do it again and the room is <br/>\nclean! Maybe not spotless, but if I can see most of the floor and the toys <br/>\nare on shelves or in toy boxes and the clothes are in a hamper or in a drawer <br/>\n(I don&#39;t worry if they are folded or not) then I am happy. <br/>\nNow that my kids are older, we don&#39;t do the hula-hoop thing any more. Now <br/>\nthey turn on the stereo upstairs, I set the timer on the stove for say 20-30 <br/>\nminutes and they have that much time to work a miracle! Again, if the floor <br/>\nis de-cluttered enough that one of the kids can run the vacuum over it and <br/>\nnot suck up any LEGOs or socks then I am happy. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] unschooling after homeschooling AND cleaning rooms","postDate":"1024529035","msgId":38423,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkuMjliY2ZhOTYuMmE0MjZjOGJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38417,"nextInTopic":38425,"prevInTime":38422,"nextInTime":38424,"topicId":38363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/19/02 1:26:57 PM, lapin@olypen.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2069566359\">In a message dated 6/19/02 1:26:57 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lapin@...\">lapin@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Ok, change of subject.

With unschooling, what do you do about those messy<br/>\nrooms, and NOT wanting to clean those messy rooms.  Toys are one thing, but<br/>\nthe dirty clothes are another story.

When they do clean their rooms, it is all shooved under their<br/>\nbed and behind the closet doors.  Of course I also did this as a kid.  I go<br/>\nback and forth with worrying about it and not worrying about it, which I am<br/>\nsure gives mixed messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur middle son is the one that is good at managing to drag most of his toys<br/>\nout into the living room in a day, and then never wants to put them all<br/>\nback.

However, when time came to sign our oldest up<br/>\nfor school, I felt the pressure....media, relatives, etc.....  He went to<br/>\nKindegarten which was beautiful, but First grade was a joke and I took him<br/>\nout at winter break.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur middle guy went to K for only three months when I took him out the same<br/>\ntime I took his older brother out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so glad our youngest never has to go to school!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year, we enrolled in an &quot;alternative learning program&quot; through our<br/>\nlocal school district.  We bought a beautiful curriculum (Oak Meadow),<br/>\nsigned up for some fun classes and thought we were set.  Slowly through the<br/>\nyear, life stresses (having to move from our home because a sex offender was<br/>\nliving next door), etc... caused us to not &quot;do school&quot;.  I have to say my<br/>\nchildren were so much happier, so much more interested in books, so much<br/>\nmore interested in bird watching, finding the names of the flowers in our<br/>\narea, playing knights, and acting out Harry Potter, and just playing legos<br/>\nfor HOURS and DAYS.  We read Harry Potter, a Lewis and Clark book, two<br/>\nnative american adventure books, and as I was learning how to spin wool, so<br/>\ndid they.  They have their own drop spindles, they know how to finger knit<br/>\ntheir newly spun wool.  We took extra time to play with our six rabbits, and<br/>\nextra time to just do nothing at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow!!!  I still have that little voice that says &quot;do school&quot;, but when I<br/>\nlook through even my very favorite curriculum, textbooks, etc...  it all<br/>\nseems so lame.  It pretty much all seems like busy work, it is<br/>\nuninteresting, uncreative and dull.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here I am at your unschooling site, and ALL the unschooling stuff that I<br/>\ncan find on the net.  I love it!  I hope to find lots of support on this<br/>\nlist as I go through the change from the old nagging &quot;do school&quot;, that has<br/>\nnot left my thoughts yet.  I have already read Mary Griffiths Unschooling<br/>\nhandbook, but would like to read more on unschooling, any suggestions gladly<br/>\nreceived.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the homeschoolers in our area are very fundamentalist, and we are<br/>\nnot religious at all (spiritual agnostic).  It is hard to find a niche to<br/>\nfit into.  Most of our friends and the boys friends over the last two years<br/>\nhave been public school kids, who we really seem to relate to better.

Maybe they&#39;d just like to stare up at the clouds. Maybe <br/>\nit&#39;s the perfect moment to ask you that relationship question that&#39;s been <br/>\nbugging them. If you don&#39;t plan this time in a certain way, it can become <br/>\nanything. Let them play and explore and rest and talk and gather and sort <br/>\nand pretend to their heart&#39;s delight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can have them decide which cereal or yogurt to pick out at the <br/>\nstore. *You* can notice if they need help with pricing, volume, nutritional <br/>\nvalue, whatever. In fact a trip to a new grocery store can be an adventure <br/>\nin itself. It&#39;s amazing how accustomed we get to our own little world of <br/>\nfood. A visit to an ethnic grocery, wharehouse store or natural food co-op <br/>\nwill spark all sorts of new ideas, tastes and questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nShow them how to find and download stuff off the internet. Keep them well <br/>\nsupplied in scales, measuring tapes, pencils, crayons, paints, paper, books, <br/>\nvideos, things to take apart, things to put together, maps, playgrounds, <br/>\nbuilding toys, games, cards, dice, measuring spoons, magnifying glasses, <br/>\ndirt, water and *you*.

As they get used to their new UN-schooly freedom, they&#39;ll surprise <br/>\nyou even more with their choices of interests out there in the real world. <br/>\nIt won&#39;t have to be purchased from a kit though (although sometimes kits are <br/>\nfun and desired around here). It will be something they come across just by <br/>\nliving.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We are getting a bunny and guinea pig at the end of the month but instead <br/>\n&gt;&gt;of going out and buying a ready made cage we are going to build an outdoor <br/>\n&gt;&gt;hutch.  I hope this opens itself to other building projects and perhaps <br/>\n&gt;&gt;bird feeders, etc.  Is this what you mean by giving them &quot;other things&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could be. But if you limit yourself to looking towards the goal of other <br/>\nbuilding projects, you may not appreciate some real learning taking place in <br/>\na totally different area.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a guinea pig and rabbit. They house beautifully together. We <br/>\ngot the rabbit to keep the pig company since we learned that piggies are <br/>\nsocial animals. We&#39;ve had a blast just watching the two animals interact. <br/>\nRabbits are bold and fearless. Piggies are skittish and careful. But put <br/>\nthem together and a wonderful nurturing takes place. The piggie started <br/>\ncoming out more and getting a little bolder. The rabbit nurtures the pig and <br/>\nactually pushes his little butt out of the cage for a visit. They are <br/>\namazing to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe would also like to build an outside hutch for them after we move. When we <br/>\ndo, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll learn all sorts of new stuff. Maybe someone will want to <br/>\nbuild more, maybe not. It&#39;s the experience of the moment that counts though. <br/>\nThe journey. The getting there. If I look too much towards the next step, I <br/>\nmight miss the joy and learning and opportunities in the step I&#39;m on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I guess growing up in public school and teaching preschool and preK, has <br/>\n&gt;&gt;warped my brain into thinking I have to have a schedule and know what we <br/>\n&gt;&gt;are going to cover next month or two months from now.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve all had to shake off that type of thinking to a certain extent. Some <br/>\nof us more than others, based on our background. ;-) What has helped me, is <br/>\nto look at my &quot;schedule&quot; as continuing on until my kids are grown. That&#39;s a <br/>\nlot of time to grow and learn and mature. It gives us a LOT of flexibility. <br/>\nAnd along the way they get to just live their lives right now, in the <br/>\nmoment. They don&#39;t have to wait until they finish some arbitrary grade or <br/>\nlesson plan to start being functioning members of society.

Take a complete break from <br/>\nthinking about schooling, educating or teaching your kids at all. Just be <br/>\nwith them for a few months. You&#39;ve got the time, take it so you can all <br/>\ndecompress and get used to this new way of thinking.

OTOH, sometimes I get to the point that I don&#39;t buy <br/>\nthings because I think of them as too &quot;educational&quot; and forget that just <br/>\nbecause something is more on the schoolish side, doesn&#39;t mean that it is <br/>\nnecessarily bad. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis afternoon, I brought out the Mindware catalog. I was amazed at some of <br/>\nthe things Moly and Jack picked out, some of which because of the age/grade <br/>\nlevels posted I would have passed by. Jack wants a game called Tantrix <br/>\n(grades 5 and up, he is 6) I wouldn&#39;t have picked it out for him, because I <br/>\nlooked at the &quot;age guide&quot; and passed it by as something too logically <br/>\nadvanced for him. Maybe it will be, and then maybe he will modify the &quot;rules&quot; <br/>\nto fit his abilities. All I know is that he says it looks like something he <br/>\nwould like. Then Darin brought out the McGraw Hill catalog (we started <br/>\ngetting it a year or so ago when Darin still wasn&#39;t sold on the unschooling <br/>\nidea, and wanted me to buy more &quot;educational&quot; books.) I looked at it and <br/>\nrolled my eyes at him. But he gave it to the kids and gave me a *just wait* <br/>\nlook. Moly picked out two things in it. One was a learn to speak Spanish book <br/>\nwith flash cards and the other was a book on prominent African Americans and <br/>\nevents. When I asked why she had picked these two books, she said she wanted <br/>\nto know more about one of her new ball teammates. She and the rest of her <br/>\nball team were invited to his birthday party, and both his grandmothers fixed <br/>\nethnic foods for the kids and they played games and music that Moly hadn&#39;t <br/>\nheard of or played before. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo even though we want to pick games and books because our children are <br/>\ninterested in them not because they are educational, we also don&#39;t want to go <br/>\nso far as to disregard things *because* they are educational. <br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27496206,"authorName":"Amy Thomlinson","from":"Amy Thomlinson &lt;diamond_h2o@...&gt;","profile":"diamond_h2o","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re:revelation","postDate":"1024281235","msgId":38371,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNjE3MDIzMzU1LjM5MjQyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzMzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFlajcydCttYXNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38370,"nextInTopic":38372,"prevInTime":38370,"nextInTime":38372,"topicId":38363,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love this post! ... ===== If God meant for us to go around naked we would be born that way! __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1436641107\">I love this post!<br/>\n--- kayb85 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sheran@...\">sheran@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think to get to the point at which many on this<br/>\n&gt; list are , you have <br/>\n&gt; to give up worrying about what they are learning and<br/>\n&gt; if they are <br/>\n&gt; learning.

She made her dad<br/>\na father&#39;s day card in a secret code of her own creation. She baked a<br/>\ncake. She swam at our club with a friend. She played air hockey at the<br/>\nclub. She prepared a garden plot and planted pumpkins. She made 5 outs<br/>\nduring one softball game (as fielder, not batter). She read more about<br/>\norphan trains.
