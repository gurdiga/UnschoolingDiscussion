They had yelling and screaming fights when I was there, a <br/>\n  lot. My friend would scream things like &quot;I hate you!! I&#39;ll never be <br/>\n  like you!!&quot; etc.. The mom, one of the wisest people I&#39;ve ever met, <br/>\n  would sometimes lose it and yell back but as soon as my friend ran <br/>\n  from the room and slammed the door of her bedroom, her mom would look <br/>\n  over at me and say &quot;Herman&#39;s heart is in the right place.&quot; (Herman <br/>\n  was her nickname for my friend) Then she and I would talk about <br/>\n  whatever for a while. Then the mom would go to the door of her <br/>\n  daughter&#39;s room and say in a cutsefied voice &quot;I love you Herman!&quot;, my <br/>\n  friend would sometimes growl at her and sometimes reply, in a similar <br/>\n  cutsefied voice, &quot;I love you too ma!&quot; and we would all get back to <br/>\n  drinking coffee and talking about whatever. Sometimes my friend would <br/>\n  ask me whether I came over to be with her or her mom, I always said <br/>\n  both. <br/>\n       Anyway, this mom was diagnosed with an aggressive kind of skin <br/>\n  cancer. My friend, without even thinking twice, dropped out of high <br/>\n  school to take care of her. I cut out a lot to help because Judy, the <br/>\n  mom was my friend too. We made her dinners and took her to <br/>\n  appointments and cleaned house for her. We had parties with our <br/>\n  friends at her house. She was lying on the couch feeling awful and <br/>\n  she spent her time with a bunch of teenagers!!! We were not exactly <br/>\n  the quiet, studious crowd (I was but I was an oddball, the rest were <br/>\n  what wouldve been called &quot;burnouts&quot;).<br/>\n       When Judy was dying, she asked to be taken home from the <br/>\n  hospital, they would not discharge her. My friend walked up to the <br/>\n  nurses and said, &quot;I am taking my mom home.&quot; They gave her some flak <br/>\n  about paperwork and my friend said she was not interested in <br/>\n  paperwork, but her mom&#39;s wishes. She picked her mom up and walked <br/>\n  down to the car with a nurse following her with papers. She was with <br/>\n  her mom when she died a few weeks later. Judy called me at work 30 <br/>\n  minutes before she died and asked me &quot;Take care of Herman for me.&quot;I <br/>\n  said I would.<br/>\n       The thing about Judy which left such an impression on me was <br/>\n  that she was able to look past her daughter&#39;s acting out and see the <br/>\n  real person inside. She did not speak to the acting out Herman but to <br/>\n  the wonderful Herman inside. My friend and I have both tried to do <br/>\n  this with our own children when they drive us crazy for whatever <br/>\n  reason. And...yes, in case you were wondering, my friend is an <br/>\n  unschooling mom and has been for 10 years. Also, many of the <br/>\n  teenagers who hung out in her mom&#39;s living room listening to heavy <br/>\n  metal music  while she lay on the couch still know each other. It is <br/>\n  amazing what one mom&#39;s attitude toward her child can accomplish!! I <br/>\n  hope this story is encouraging.<br/>\n                -Elissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
