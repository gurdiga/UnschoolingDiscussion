It bothered me and I would do the whole &quot;say thank you&quot; thing and they<br/>\n  would say it then. I started to really think about it and why they didn&#39;t do<br/>\n  it and why it bothered me. My kids weren&#39;t really being rude at all. From<br/>\n  what I could see, they were just being kids and had no clue most of the time<br/>\n  that someone would be &quot;expecting&quot; a thank you or just very involved in the<br/>\n  moment or just having their brain be somewhere else. So I figured what&#39;s the<br/>\n  harm really? They&#39;re still kids and Tara certainly is very polite and where<br/>\n  did she get it from? Us and watching.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So now I just leave it to me doing what I feel is proper and sometimes I<br/>\n  just offer thank you&#39;s for them. Sierra can be very shy at times and<br/>\n  sometimes a thank you is just too much for her. I won&#39;t push that and I<br/>\n  won&#39;t &quot;make them&quot; offer politeness without sincerity. I know they will get<br/>\n  it eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if there are times when I think maybe with a friend something would have<br/>\n  been nice other than what was done, I&#39;ll talk to them about it. Reminding<br/>\n  them how when they do something for each other, they like to be thanked for<br/>\n  it and wouldn&#39;t it make someone else feel nice too? We do a lot of talking<br/>\n  here about our feelings with each other and then relating that to other<br/>\n  people as well. Asking how would that make you feel or what would be nice<br/>\n  for you to do??? They even like this kind of talking to, it gives them<br/>\n  another outlook on things and they like coming up with different ways or<br/>\n  wondering how other people would feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
