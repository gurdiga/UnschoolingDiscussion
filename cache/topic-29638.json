(Well, the<br/>\nscale he describes might have been more complicated  the thing he wanted<br/>\nthe kids to figure out was that things weigh more farther out  the<br/>\nprinciple of the lever. The weights could be placed at varying distances<br/>\nfrom the fulcrum.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the original text, he describes how he and a colleague were trying to<br/>\nhelp children develop their thinking skills, or some such rot. Then, in<br/>\nthe revised edition (in which he wisely changed nothing of his original<br/>\njournal entries, but only added his new thoughts on them twenty or so years<br/>\nlater), he remarks that, after all the feverish effort he and his colleague<br/>\nhad put into these thinking games (with pretty dismal results), one day he<br/>\nforgot and left the scale by accident on a table in the back of another<br/>\nclassroom, and guess what?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kids figured it out on their own in no time, with no prodding,<br/>\nhinting, encouragement, bribes or other manipulation. So I say, go ahead and<br/>\nbuy some stuff (I like Cuisenaire rods, too), but for goodness sake let<br/>\nyour kids play with it ON THEIR OWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids (or adults) are too closely observed in their learning, they<br/>\nbecome self-conscious.
