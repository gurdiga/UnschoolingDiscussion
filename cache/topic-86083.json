Dh does not want <br/>\nthem to get stolen or for them to be in the elements.    He has a collection of <br/>\nover 50 bikes ( LOL, they are not all in the BR).. Most of them are hanging <br/>\nin our garage and workshop.  He has 3 he keeps in the BR, lovingly draped with <br/>\nsheets to keep the dust off..   I am so accustomed to having them in the BR, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think twice about it.. but when a friend saw them parked up here, she <br/>\nwas befuddled.. LOL.. She said &quot; uh, does he think he can ride them in his <br/>\ndreams&quot;&quot;  LOL.    She also said &quot;My Dh loves golf, but he doesnt take his clubs to <br/>\nbe with him&quot;  .   He also brings his &quot;projects&quot; up here to work on in his <br/>\nlittle bike corner. It&#39;s warm and dry and he has a nice place to sit and he can <br/>\nwatch TV.     Hey, if anyone is in the market for a restored vintage <br/>\nlightweight bike, you know who to email !  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86036,"nextTopicId":86084}}
