We can see each other while we talk, using MSN instant messenger.  There are other free programs, such as Yahoo messenger.  AOL probably has something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really a great way to keep in touch.  Not only can she &quot;see&quot; her grandkids, but they can hold things up to the camera to show her - artwork or a new toy, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrices vary greatly.  We happened to get ours on a buy one, get one free deal.  We got a fairly low end, but it works well enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know lots of people have these already, but thought I&#39;d mention it for those who haven&#39;t considered the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110755,"nextTopicId":110785}}
