You live your life with them.  You engage them <br/>\nin things that interest you or that might interest them.  You cheer <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re bored because out of that boredom may come a wonderful <br/>\nidea for a new project.  One of the most helpful things we did when <br/>\nwe first started was to do anything but school-like stuff.  We took a <br/>\nlot of field trips, nature walks, etc. - just celebrating the fact <br/>\nthat we were free.  We read aloud until my voice was shot and then <br/>\nread some more.  We also watched tv and played video games - still <br/>\ndo.  In fact yesterday  my 13 year old spent lots of time with a <br/>\nvideo game,  but to help him through it,  he drew a map to scale as <br/>\nthe game progressed.  We have learned so much from television shows <br/>\nand games.  With unlimited tv and video games here,  my kids became <br/>\nmore selective on their own.  Enjoy your kids and your family and the <br/>\nlearning will come.  There will be many times that you won&#39;t be able <br/>\nto figure out where they learned what they know because with an <br/>\nunschooling lifestyle their brains seem so much more receptive to <br/>\nlittle snippets of info that pass others by.
