It&#39;s amazing that it sometimes takes an outside opinion to make you see what you have already suspected. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think so often I won&#39;t just say no to things because I am trying so hard not to be limiting. My mother never let me cook - because it was her kitchen. I always let my daughter cook - with supervision of course ;) but she is a great baker and I know she has learned fractions, measuring etc. by cooking.  She also isn&#39;t afraid to just try things - if a recipe is 5 pages long, she will sit there and follow it step by step - and figure it out. I would tend to look at it and say - another day!   So I am working towards a certain atmosphere here - but it is absolutley true that I can&#39;t expect from them what I am not modelling myself...  It will be a bit of a learning experience here.   I think sometimes it&#39;s a pyshcological battle of trying NOT to be &quot;scheduled&quot; - but I suppose unscheduled doesn&#39;t have to mean messy!  <br/>\n<br/>\n I have a friend whose childern had a basket of beanie babies in their room. ( at the time when they wer worth something ;)  She always let her girls play with them.

I<br/>\n  recall a story told by the wife of an English diplomat living in Brazil in a<br/>\n  house with servants who spoke only Portugese. Every once in a while, after<br/>\n  noticing several things out of place or missing (stolen by the servants) she<br/>\n  simply screamed her feelings, in English, of course,<br/>\n  &quot;Where&#39;s my whatchamacallit? etc, etc.&quot;<br/>\n  The servants, feeling guilty and believing she was threatening them with<br/>\n  terrible punishments for their misdeeds, returned everything to its proper<br/>\n  place by the next morning, and life carried on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of my former wives like to yell.
