She is a big helper also.  I see such a <br/>\nlarge difference between the oldest and middle child. She is an independent <br/>\nplayer and he has more of a difficult time with that. My guess is it si from <br/>\nbeing in school. Wish I could turn back time and do it right. <br/>\nI have watched the two of them the past couple days and I have to say he does <br/>\ntry to help her with things but she just screams.  I think she knows she can <br/>\ncontrol situations by screaming cuz we all let her have her way so she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwake the baby. That in it self has created a big screamer.

I think I get into the thinking that it will work <br/>\nagainst our Unschooling.  <br/>\nWhat I mean is that I paint a picture in my mind of what someone or a group <br/>\nlooks like. I almost make it look super human.  For instance I may think <br/>\nUnschoolers dont have sibling issues, spouse disagreements, untidy homes and so on. <br/>\nThe only way I know is to read the emails.<br/>\nI dont know of more than a couple total Unschoolers here. Here some say <br/>\nunschooling but the fact is that they still schedule music, swimming or some kind <br/>\nof class for their kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I take a person or a group I respect hold them up high and follow <br/>\nas much as I can.  I may take some or all whatever applies to my family that <br/>\nisn&#39;t working for us at the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love my kids and I want to do right by them.

I have it saved but I forget it is <br/>\nthere. I forwarded it on to a friend who is beginning to HS. I think she wants to <br/>\nUnschool but is buying a few subjects.  : / I keep explaining the Deschooling <br/>\nand she is convinced it will happen over the summer. <br/>\nI almost feel like she doesn&#39;t think that our Unschooling is learning. Or <br/>\nthat im dumbing my kids but not using anything.<br/>\nI caught myself flipping through a &quot;complete curriculum&quot; the other day at the <br/>\nstore.  I didn&#39;t plan on buying it but it was reassuring to look in it and <br/>\nknow that the 11 yr. old already knows all the junk in it from living.  I guess <br/>\nsome of the conversations are rubbing off on me: / <br/>\nOr maybe she thinks this way because of the below paragraph.  I don&#39;t speak <br/>\nmy concerns to her about this because I don&#39;t think it will help her along the <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids pick at each other so much that I worry about what I am doing wrong <br/>\nas far as Unschooling goes.  The competition between the two is maddening. They <br/>\nare 3 . 5 and 11.  My 11 yr. old was in school for 3 . 5 years and some of <br/>\nthe issues where that he was always a target. Why is he doing this at home if he <br/>\nhated it so much?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is major concern in our home that causes so much parental involvement. <br/>\nWhat I mean is I know how we deal with it is no good.  I do try to show him the <br/>\nflip side, how would he like it if someone said that to him and sending him <br/>\nto his room.  Its just non stop he comes into a room and jumps on the couch or <br/>\nbed while she is involved in something or makes teasing comments like &quot;I have <br/>\nan Ice Cream&quot; or &quot;Cassidy look what I have Na na na na bo bo&quot; Then she <br/>\nscreams, wakes the baby its a mess..........<br/>\n He is fine with other kids it&#39;s just his sister.<br/>\nThe 3 . 5 yr. old isn&#39;t as un-knowledgable as he thinks.  She has him figured <br/>\nout and knows what he is doing is wrong.  He at times spells something to her <br/>\nand she knows what he has spelled. So I guess I dont look at her as 3 . 5 but <br/>\nmore intellectually as a 5 or 6 yr. old.  She can tell time, spell certain <br/>\nwords and can read me like a book.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be answering my own question but did we (DH and I) cause this? I have <br/>\ntried to be fair in what and when I speak to each child and how far I let <br/>\nthings go.  When they begin to hit and hurt each other I step in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone see this in their home and then it went away? <br/>\nSuggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71283,"nextTopicId":71289}}
