Both of them think that if they are not doing<br/>\ntheir textbooks or workbooks they are not &quot;doing &#39;school&#39;&quot;, especially<br/>\nKaela.    Brandon loves unschooling.  He learns so much on his own, but<br/>\nhe feels like he&#39;s not &quot;doing &#39;school&#39;&quot;.  I guess it is my fault they<br/>\nfeel like this.  For the last 2 yrs I have been hsing through the school<br/>\nsystem (K-8 homestudy).  We had a wonderful teacher who would come out<br/>\nto our house once a week and check Brandon&#39;s work.  He loved her!  And<br/>\nKaela was looking forward to having her come to the house to spend 1 on<br/>\n1 time with her, too!  But this year I decided to try something<br/>\ndifferent and now I have my 5yr old thinking she isn&#39;t &#39;doing school&#39;<br/>\nunless she has worked in her workbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can a 5 yr old know what &quot;school&quot; is all about if she&#39;s never been?<br/>\nShe&#39;s never even been to preschool!  I guess this is the bad part of<br/>\nkids teaching one another, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving for Him,<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3377,"nextTopicId":3336}}
