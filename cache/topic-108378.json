We have several interns where I <br/>\nwork and it&#39;s semi-formal - they have to interview; they have to keep <br/>\na timesheet to turn in so they can get paid, they don&#39;t get paid for <br/>\ndays off/sick time, they DO need to call in if they won&#39;t be in, they <br/>\nhave to keep to a reasonably regular schedule (one person is only in <br/>\non Weds and Friday because his college classes are Mon, Tues, Thurs; <br/>\nanother is in every day but works 3 pm to 6 pm - in both cases they <br/>\nare limited to 20 hrs maximum per week unless there is special <br/>\napproval for additional hours). Also, our interns (who are college <br/>\nstudents) are required to (a) be taking at least part time hours (b) <br/>\nkeep their GPA up to C or better - if they don&#39;t enroll for classes or <br/>\ntheir GPA drops, their manager will discuss their future employment <br/>\nwith them. They have to abide by the rest of company policy as far as <br/>\nattire, behavior, etc. (for example, it&#39;s a no-smoking environment so <br/>\nno smoking on the premises).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking sure everything is spelled out clearly and agreed to by both <br/>\nparties is a way to help keep things from going awry.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Internships","postDate":"1126983878","msgId":108378,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRnaHBjNitiamFpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108379,"prevInTime":108377,"nextInTime":108379,"topicId":108378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m looking for those who are familiar with interships.
