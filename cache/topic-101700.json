Keep inspiring us, mama! <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted: Thursday, December 23, 2004<br/>\nArticle comment by: Angel Goulet<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of Hard Knocks Professor Reality, I&#39;ve been unschooling for over 15 years, and I know for sure unschoolers are not fools, and we&#39;re not rude either, so we&#39;ve got one up on you. If that&#39;s the kind of conduct you learn in your school, count me out. Great article, Kelly. <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted: Thursday, December 23, 2004<br/>\nArticle comment by: Barda Allen<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the best articles on unschooling that I have read in the mainstream press. My appreciation goes out to the reporter and to the awesome family of unschoolers she interviewed. We are also an unschooling family and our oldest daughter (22 years old) is a Clinique Manager at Bon-Macy, able to climb the corporate ladder with either company!<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted: Thursday, December 23, 2004<br/>\nArticle comment by: Kelli&#39;s Brother<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that this a very good article and the &quot;kiddies&quot; will do just fine. I think that its obvious that Professor Reality was too schooled. Your ignorance and lack of self confidence shows. You need to pick on young children. As their Uncle, I&#39;ll make sure that NO one will receive hard knocks!! Not these kids. Reality is, you&#39;re no match for them. They live life with their eyes wide open. You barely have one open. <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted: Thursday, December 23, 2004<br/>\nArticle comment by: Stacie Johnston<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great article on unschooling!

Alec, and his sisters Abbi, 10, and Kyra, 7, are being ï¿½un-schooledï¿½ ï¿½ self-directed learning in their home. <br/>\n<br/>\nUn-schooling means no written tests, worksheets or regimented schedules throughout the day. Kelli serves as a tour-guide for their three children ï¿½ not a teacher. Tim Traaseth is also a tour-guide for the kids, when heï¿½s not at work as a pharmaceutical sales representative. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last three years, the Traaseth kids have been un-schooled. The kids have tried district schools, charter schools and approximately half a year of home schooling before nestling into un-schooling. Both parents attended traditional schools growing up, but chose un-schooling for their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nï¿½Un-schooling is more about living life and following a childï¿½s interests,ï¿½ Kelli said. ï¿½Being able to do un-schooling (well) you have to look through the childï¿½s eyes.ï¿½ Proponents believe un-schooling is receptive to a childï¿½s inherent curiosity and natural desire to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlec, Abbi and Kyra pursue their changing interests and Kelli is charged with providing resources for those interests ï¿½ a strategy called ï¿½strewing.ï¿½ <br/>\n<br/>\nPursuing interests <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a Wednesday afternoon in November, Kyra decided she wanted to make a multiplication table. Her older sister, was helping her fill it in. Kyra, a budding artist, produces piles of paintings seeped in color and loaded with glitter. Sheï¿½s also interested in learning to spell names of things. The kitchen is covered in post-it note labels saying ï¿½refrigerator,ï¿½ and ï¿½freezer.ï¿½ A wooden, antiqued calendar on the wall is marked along with nearly every door in the whole house. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater that afternoon Kyra and Abbi cut out paper-dolls ï¿½ ï¿½Little House on the Prairieï¿½ dolls with frontier clothing and dolls from India with traditional Indian dress. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe family bookshelf is loaded with Eyewitness books about ancient Egypt and mythology. The computer table has reading and math games.Abbiï¿½s learned to crochet and likes to spend time on-line instant messaging and playing interactive computer building games like Sim City. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while she was interested in Shakespeare. After seeing a Harry Potter film, she recalled the ï¿½double, double, toil and trouble,ï¿½ spell ï¿½ which was taken from Macbeth. Kelli recognized the connection from reading it in college, and read together with her daughter from the book. This led to the movie rental of ï¿½Macbeth,ï¿½ ï¿½Hamlet,ï¿½ ï¿½West Side Story,ï¿½ (based on Romeo and Juliet) and ï¿½Shakespeare in Love,ï¿½ which includes a number of references to Shakespeareï¿½s works. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe saw the Paul Bunyan Playhouse production of Shakespeareï¿½s ï¿½The Twelfth Nightï¿½ three times, and played ï¿½Go Fishï¿½ with cards printed with lines from Shakespeareï¿½s plays. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll three of the kids are frequently involved in discussions. ï¿½Discussion is huge,ï¿½ Kelli said. ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½re doing it all the time and always learning.ï¿½ <br/>\n<br/>\nNearly everything is done with parent and child together. Un-schooling is very hands-on for parents, Kelli explained. And the process of exploratory learning continues all the time, year round. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophy <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the students began un-schooling three years ago, Kelli started with a more regimented schedule and kept a journal for the first few weeks trying to record the learning that was going on. She soon abandoned trying to categorize and classify everything and wholeheartedly accepted the philosophy of un-schooling: student-directed learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the core beliefs is that a person will learn what he or she needs to know ï¿½ in due time. Un-schooling is hinged on the natural progression of learning, rather than a regimented timeline. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is that by following their interests, theyï¿½ll learn more than if they are forced to study particular subjects. <br/>\n<br/>\nï¿½You canï¿½t teach a person whoï¿½s unwilling to learn,ï¿½ Kelli explained. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt, an education critic who published in the 1960s and ï¿½70s was a proponent of un-schooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn his book ï¿½Instead of Education: Ways to Help People Do Things Better,ï¿½ John Holt writes that he is in favor of ï¿½doing ï¿½ self-directed, purposeful, meaningful life and work,ï¿½ and against ï¿½educationï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½Learning cut off from active life and done under pressure.ï¿½ <br/>\n<br/>\nHe writes that learning is inherent in living and by doing things and that people ï¿½learnï¿½ whatï¿½s interesting, helpful or exciting to them. He writes, ï¿½Whether I learn, depends on whether it helps me do my work and live and enjoy my life.ï¿½ <br/>\n<br/>\nThrough un-schooling, Kelli hopes that her children will continue the desire for life-long learning and that their developing interests may lead to their lifeï¿½s work. ï¿½If people pursue things they enjoy, the well-roundedness comes through,ï¿½ she said. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli is confident that subject areas will be revealed through their everyday interests. For instance, while Alec is interested in computer and video games, he utilizes math and problem solving skills, among others. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam Laricchia, an un-schooler from Canada and contributor to Life Learning Magazine, wrote about what her sonï¿½s interest in video games yielded in an article titled ï¿½Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Video Games.ï¿½ <br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the skills she mentions are: reading game manuals and walkthroughs; research through gaming magazines or the internet; writing through correspondence with other players on-line or writing gaming critiques; typing; logic through solving puzzles, formulas, percentage charts in playerï¿½s guides and statistics. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game that Alec is interested in, offers similar complexities. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is made up of 50 game cards including Monster, Spell, Trap and Foil cards. Each type of card is divided into further sub-categories, according to the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game official website. The Monster Card alone has 20 different types and six different attributes ï¿½ which in turn affect the characterï¿½s ability to attack and defend. The combinations are dizzying. <br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the kids at home allows for more interaction with adults in the community, Kelli said, as well as their peers. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Abbi and Kyra have been involved in tumbling/gymnastics class and play productions of Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh. All three kids took pottery class. At one time, Alec played the cello and was in science club. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids really get to know each other, as they typically spend all day together. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli gets up early in the morning along with Kyra, an early riser, and spends some time one-on-one with her. Frequently the kids are sprawled all over the three-floor house doing various projects. Alec might be downstairs playing computer games on a large TV screen, Abbi might be seated at the computer in the dining room and Kyra can be found sitting on a high-legged stool painting at the kitchen counter. <br/>\n<br/>\nUn-schooling the kids is not about sheltering them, but rather indulging their interests and allowing them to shine, Kelli said. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!
