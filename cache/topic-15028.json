My oldest is artistically and dramatically <br/>\nmotivated. She spent a lot of her childhood playing Barbies, reading fiction <br/>\nand fairy tales, watching TV and drawing. She did some creative drama classes <br/>\nwhen she was little. The teacher worked with folk tales and mythology and the <br/>\nkids created their own stories and acted them out. Then for a while she took <br/>\nvisual art classes. When she was 12yo I strongly encouraged her to take <br/>\nanother drama class as I felt she was avoiding it out of insecurity. It went <br/>\nwell. When she was a teenager she went to an unschool/highschool and did <br/>\nimprov drama there and then did two summers of a <br/>\nShakespeare in Santa Fe internship. Now at age 20 she is studying at City <br/>\nCollege of San Francisco. She is a &quot;classic&quot; unschooler in that she did only <br/>\nwhat she was interested in while growing up and very little of it looked like <br/>\nschool. This coming semester she is planning to take an English class which <br/>\nwill be her first experience with an academic class. When she took the <br/>\nplacement tests for her school (her first tests ever) she placed into College <br/>\nEnglish. When she tried taking it she realized she had been tested on her <br/>\nreading ability only and felt the writing aspect of the class would be too <br/>\nhard. She had no problem dropping the class and waiting for this semester to <br/>\ntake the one before it. I see her being very comfortable with who she is.   <br/>\nShe has never become motivated to learn Math or Science and for the kind of <br/>\nschooling she wants from an acting conservatory, it&#39;s irrelevant. She does <br/>\nhave a checking account that she is managing. She&#39;s doing it her own way and <br/>\nI&#39;m crossing my fingers she doesn&#39;t overdraw the account but so far so good. <br/>\nShe just received her first order of checks with flower fairies on them:&gt;)<br/>\n    As to the question of outside activities, classes etc., with younger <br/>\nchildren I always made sure the activities were developmentally appropriate <br/>\n(e.g. space for imagination), run by kind, nonintrusive people and not very <br/>\ncompetitive, for example the drama classes I mentioned above for my oldest. <br/>\n    My second one is physically and musically motivated. He took creative <br/>\ndance at age 4, &quot;played&quot; basketball at a Boys and Girls club at age 5 and <br/>\nthen again later at a community center. I&#39;ll never forget that little long <br/>\nhaired boy running up and down the basketball court completely and happily <br/>\nabsorbed in his fantasy of playing basketball, not at all connected to what <br/>\nthe other kids (who were a bit older) were doing. Later he played T-Ball at a <br/>\nYMCA. Then at around 7 or 8 my sister got him into judo. We refused to let <br/>\nhim compete until we felt he was ready. Competition was not built into the <br/>\nclass but my sister was eager for him to do it. Then when he did compete he <br/>\ndid quite well.<br/>\n     When he was ten and we moved to Santa Fe and met our spiritual Teacher <br/>\nhis musical gift &quot;kicked in.&quot; He learned the flute and played for a while in <br/>\na homeschool band, then later in a kids original jazz/rock band. Meanwhile he <br/>\nalso started to learn to play tabla, the Hindu temple drums. <br/>\n    Since age 12 he has become very spiritually motivated as well as <br/>\ncontinuing with music. Now, at age 15, he only plays devotional music and is <br/>\nworking in a restaurant to be able to travel with Amma (our Teacher) this <br/>\nsummer. He is also working on a high school diploma through a charter school <br/>\nby taking science and computer classes at a community college and doing <br/>\nhumanities and Math at home. He&#39;s doing all this so he can get a well paying <br/>\njob so he can afford to be with Amma as much as possible. He&#39;s also really <br/>\ninto watching professional sports, playing sports video games and keeping <br/>\ntrack of all the statistics etc.<br/>\n    I can&#39;t emphasize enough how vital to unschooling I consider free choice <br/>\nto be.  To me it is much more important than how it looks on the outside or <br/>\nwhat kind of classes they take. My 20yo has recently chosen to take a second <br/>\nclass from a drama teacher who spent way too much time yelling at the <br/>\nstudents last semester. She feels that nonetheless she can learn from this <br/>\nperson and doesn&#39;t take it personally. She went through quite a process with <br/>\nthis class and ended up doing well in it. This never would have worked when <br/>\nshe was a child! My kids make their choices through introspection and through <br/>\ndialogue with me. I would not be having my son do this high school rigmarole <br/>\nif it was up to me but he feels strongly guided to do it. I am supporting him <br/>\nin that choice and I see him growing from it. He is not inherently <br/>\nacademically motivated so it&#39;s challenging for both of us at times.<br/>\n    My youngest. age 11, is motivated to acquire knowledge. She reads <br/>\nvoraciously and voluntarily works with her Oak Meadow curriculum even when it <br/>\nannoys her. She&#39;s studying US History and Environmental Science and says she <br/>\nwants to be both a writer and a marine biologist when she grows up. She also <br/>\ntakes a couple of classes with a Christian homeSchooling group. (Again not <br/>\nwhat I would choose.) She&#39;s taking an Anatomy class there and a writing class <br/>\n(which I&#39;m helping &quot;teach&quot; !!??) I must say the Anatomy class is way better <br/>\nthan anything one would find in a public school. She also takes African dance <br/>\nat a nearby Performing Arts center and loves to swim. She wants to try out <br/>\nfor a swim team. Although her interests are the most &quot;school&quot; like I can&#39;t <br/>\npicture her in school. She is VERY independent and self directed. <br/>\n    My goal has been to raise my children &quot;to be who they are.&quot; I feel that <br/>\nwe are succeeding. There were points along the way where I seriously <br/>\nquestioned what I was doing as it often looked so messy. Now I see each on <br/>\none emerging as a unique, autonomous person and I am truly amazed. The most <br/>\nvalidating experience I have had was that when my husband and I found our <br/>\nspiritual Teacher in 1995, each child freely chose the same for her/his self. <br/>\nThis is not something one can &quot;make&quot; happen so I feel deeply blessed that we <br/>\ncan share this as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Amalia Darling, mother to Jenny (20), Michael (15) and Ariana (11)-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"adarl52357@aol.com","from":"adarl52357@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"PXpJQONfwEPr0rWkvfr4w6cZQEndtCLPBFEjdmmtDjHxbKWvUF2Nhldc1OesrHjvC0WFEp7PqtXC","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: giftedness etc.","postDate":"979241224","msgId":15028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzLmYyOTdkMzguMjc4ZjYzMDhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15034,"prevInTime":15027,"nextInTime":15029,"topicId":15028,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m writing this to contribute to several topics: older kids +  classes/community programs + giftedness I tend to think of the differences in my kids as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-543292391\">I&#39;m writing this to contribute to several topics: <br/>\nolder kids +  classes/community programs + giftedness   <br/>\n<br/>\n    I tend to think of the differences in my kids as different motivations.  <br/>\nWhat motivates this person?
