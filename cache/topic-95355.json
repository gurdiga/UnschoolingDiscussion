It tells the mother how she has these instincual feelings as a new mother that our society instructs her to ignore such as hold your baby, respond to crys, feed on demand, etc. It is written in 25 short 2-3 page &quot;hints&quot; on how to make motherhood easier. She has had 7,8 or so kids herself which she and Dr. Sears attachment parented while young. Costs maybe $10. You can order it through La Leche on line, I think. It is very approachable, even for mainstreamers.<br/>\n--- Pat Robinson<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scubamama@...\">scubamama@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
