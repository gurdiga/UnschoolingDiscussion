My daughter Melissa<br/>\nwill be 8 on Sat. and is having a fancy  tea party this year; She loves<br/>\nWinnie the Pooh  who is also invited (it is her first dress up fancy party!)<br/>\nHer friends are all bringing their favorite doll or stuffed animal!  The<br/>\nbest thing she loves the most aside from stuffed bears and American Doll<br/>\ntype stuff is anything to do with art especially markers. Last year kids<br/>\ngave her things for gifts that shocked me like lipstick and nail polish<br/>\nsomething I no way wanted her to get into so young but i held my breath let<br/>\nher do it she only did it twice and she also painted her 6 year old<br/>\nborhter&#39;s toes (which he later regretted asking for it!) (esp because he had<br/>\nto go swimming LOL) Thankfully now she isn&#39;t so far  into makeup stuff the<br/>\nway some of the girls are! I hope that helps answer some of your questions.<br/>\nShe also loves Brownies and dance and singing and anything to do with<br/>\nperforming arts. Hence the dressup stuff! I imagine your girls will have<br/>\nlots of their special interests that they will let you know about as well.<br/>\nBeth B. newbie mom to unschooling</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"megates@juno.com","from":"megates@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"S_FIJmar3q3f2WhPvLSnLNjxXWgLovduOACXv4vayF4NvfWtNyw92zvbHqh8nLOWH6_7o3CYmA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Good News, Need Help!!!","postDate":"948945150","msgId":5826,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zODQuNTgyNi45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5820,"nextInTopic":5836,"prevInTime":5825,"nextInTime":5827,"topicId":5808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I try for plenty of unisex toys for my girls 4 & 7.

They play with cars<br/>\nand with dolls.  They like puzzles, blocks, balls, little animal and<br/>\npeople figures, helping me, playing with bread dough.  Paper, pencil,<br/>\npen, & marker.  We are enjoying American Girls books and dolls, Little<br/>\nHouse on the Prairie series, and Harry Potter.  Science experiments are<br/>\nalways a hit.  Reading, reading, books on tape, listening to music, and<br/>\ndancing.  Dress-up.  Pretending!!!!<br/>\nI don&#39;t have boys, but it seems that most of what my girls like is<br/>\nsimilar to most of what boys like.  They will wrestle, but they haven&#39;t<br/>\never made weapons of anything, that I&#39;ve noticed.  They do wiggle and<br/>\nshout, sometimes act wild and other times sit still and focus.<br/>\nI&#39;m excited for your family, Nanci, and send many best wishes for the<br/>\nadoptions!  My brother adopted a foster child, and then his sister about<br/>\n6 months later.  They are pre-teens now.
