I used Ruth Beechick&#39;s A Home Start in<br/>\nReading (one of her 3 easy books) and the Bob books.  I began with his name<br/>\nand introduced letter sounds from his name, then other words.  A few days<br/>\nlater he read the 1st Bob book.  He liked feeling masterful of reading as he<br/>\nwas able to read a whole book by himself, all the way through.  He would<br/>\nread 1-3 Bob Books a day from the 1st set (blue box).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe read a book a day in the 2nd set (red box) and began reading other things<br/>\nlike Mercer Mayer&#39;s Little Critter Books, etc.  By the time we got to the<br/>\n3rd set (yellow box) we never finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce he began reading confidently I began finding &quot;real&quot; books for him to<br/>\nread (about 4-5 weeks later).  No more &quot;phonics&quot; and never any controlled<br/>\nreaders.  He was so excited about reading for himself it was easy to keep<br/>\nhim excited because he loves &quot;real&quot; books.  He&#39;s now 7 & is reading 3rd-4th<br/>\ngrade level.  I know that the most important thing by far is for the child<br/>\nto be ready.  Mine was or I would have waited.  If he had trouble or fussed<br/>\nat the task we would have stopped and waited.  But the timing was right for<br/>\nhim & the Bob Books were a great kick-off! I would recommend them to anyone<br/>\nwhose wants to try a relaxed approach to learning to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the easy readers he liked were Geoffrey Hayes books (Otto & Uncle<br/>\nTooth Adventures) like The Secret of Foghorn Island--I think there are only<br/>\n4 of these.  He liked the Mr. Putter & Tabby books and Henry and Mudge.  Now<br/>\nif my youngest wakes from her nap before we are finished with a chapter in<br/>\nthe Hobbit, or Harry Potter, he picks up the book & continues on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck & enjoy the Bob books!<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7512,"nextTopicId":7515}}
