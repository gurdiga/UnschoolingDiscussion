I read this before the meeting with the <br/>\nschool psychologist and another round of meetings last school year.  So I <br/>\nknew what they were talking about and even told them a few of the techinques <br/>\nI&#39;d learned.  The school psychologist kept looking at me over his glasses <br/>\nwithout saying anything.  I go the feeling from the principal too that they <br/>\nwere not too happy I educated myself about his learning style.  Now of course <br/>\nEverett is at home with me so I reread the book.  I just lent it to a sister <br/>\nin law.  Another intersting thing is this book talks about kids with ADD.  He <br/>\nsays many are diagnosed with ADD when actually they just have this learning <br/>\nstyle.  The whole book title is &quot;Right Brained Children in a Left Brained <br/>\nWorld: Unlocking the Potential of your ADD Child.&quot;  The school psychologist <br/>\nhad told me personally on the playground that Everett had ADD.  The teacher <br/>\nsaid no way (she was a blessing for Everett).  Then I read that book and was <br/>\nall geared up for the meeting and the psych guy never mentioned it there at <br/>\nall.  <br/>\n  Thanks for the suggestion of Unicorns Are Real.
