This story takes place over the<br/>\n&gt;Christmas/New Year&#39;s holiday break. It was the Saturday before New<br/>\n&gt;Year&#39;s and it was about 1PM in the afternoon, and Lauren was driving<br/>\n&gt;to visit a friend. An UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put<br/>\n&gt;his lights on.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Lauren&#39;s parents have 4 children (high school and college age) and<br/>\n&gt;have always told them never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side<br/>\n&gt;of the road, but rather wait until they get a gas station, etc., so<br/>\n&gt;Lauren had actually listened to her parents advice, and promptly called #77<br/>\n&gt;on her cell phone to tell the police dispatcher that she would not pull<br/>\n&gt;over right away. She proceeded to tell the dispatcher that there was<br/>\n&gt;an unmarked police car with a flashing red light on his rooftop behind<br/>\n&gt;her.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The dispatcher checked to see if there where police cars where she<br/>\n&gt;was and there wasn&#39;t and he told her to keep driving, remain calm and<br/>\n&gt;that he had back up already on the way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ten minutes later 4 cop cars surrounded her and the unmarked car<br/>\n&gt;behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car<br/>\n&gt;behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the<br/>\n&gt;ground.... the man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other<br/>\n&gt;crimes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I never knew about the #77 Cell Phone Feature, but especially for a<br/>\n&gt;woman alone in a car, you should not pull over for an unmarked car.<br/>\n&gt;Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a<br/>\n&gt;&quot;safe&quot; place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge<br/>\n&gt;them (i.e. put on your hazard lights) or call #77 like Lauren did. Too bad<br/>\n&gt;the cell phone companies don&#39;t give you this little bit of wonderful<br/>\n&gt;information. So now it&#39;s your turn to let your friends know about<br/>\n&gt;#77.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Send this to every woman you know, it may save their life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get MSN 8 and enjoy automatic e-mail virus protection.<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/virus</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This electronic message transmission contains information from White Cap<br/>\n&gt;Industries which may be confidential or privileged.
