The only people who will be able to access the <br/>\nchannel, must have the password.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe channel is set up on Efnet.  Some of the irc servers which will <br/>\nreach efnet are:<br/>\nirc.mcs.net<br/>\nirc.nethead.com<br/>\nirc-w.frontiernet.net<br/>\nirc.core.com<br/>\nirc.concentric.net<br/>\nirc.sprynet.com<br/>\nirc.lightning.net<br/>\nirc.telia.se<br/>\nirc.prison.net<br/>\nirc.mindspring.com<br/>\nirc.idle.net<br/>\nirc.total.net<br/>\nirc.idirect.ca<br/>\nirc.etsmtl.ca<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many other servers.  If anyone has difficulty, please <br/>\nemail me, and I will send you additional servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe channel name is #unschoolkids.  To join the channel type <br/>\n&quot;/join #unschoolkids September&quot; September is the password. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download mIRC at www.mirc.co.uk, look in the download <br/>\nsection for mIRC32.  To set this software up, after you download it, <br/>\nrun the file, it will ask you where to install it and if you want to <br/>\ncreate shortcuts, allow everything it wants.  When it is done, start <br/>\nmIRC, it will prompt you with a bunch of things to setup.  There is <br/>\nFull Name, E-Mail address, Nickname and Alternative nickname.  <br/>\nFill everything in correctly.  On the left panel, it will say Connect, <br/>\nIRC, Sounds, Mouse, Dcc, Display and a bunch of other tabs.  <br/>\nDouble click on Connect, then click on Identd.  In the userid space, <br/>\nenter unschool.  mIRC is now setup and you can connect to a <br/>\nserver, once everything is setup, press Ok.  Now type &quot;/server &lt;irc <br/>\nserver&gt;&quot; where irc server is one of the servers I have included <br/>\nabove.  Once you are connected, you will see a bunch of junk flash <br/>\nby your screen, you can ignore it.  Now type in the channel name, <br/>\nand the password.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above paragraph is compliments of my not quite 13 year old <br/>\nson. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"J Salicos","from":"J Salicos &lt;elsas2@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"81fP21fXxlAe-xscqMEtBf7BOpWdL_cn7UedRgAsbcPiCwu5QjB3Vr6FvgMni8h2ChQAZ_b2Y1upBDB5dQY5P0GpJw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Fw: children&#39;s chat Colleen","postDate":"955157565","msgId":7894,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNDA4MDEzMjQ1LjE3NjQxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxMDQubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7899,"prevInTime":7893,"nextInTime":7895,"topicId":7894,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Colleen, I have an 8 1/2 yr DD who would enjoy e-mailing your 8 1/2 DD.
