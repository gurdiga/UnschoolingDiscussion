They say one of their favourite things about those vacations is being carried out to the car in the middle of the night (we usually leave around 3-4am) and being bundled in with pillows and blankets!!  LOL  They also enjoy spending a day or two in the van since we deck it out to travel: TV/VCR (I usually pick up or tape a new movie to surprise them), video games etc. and they each pack a knapsack of toys, small games, and paper/pencils to keep them happily busy. In fact, whenever I tell my youngest we&#39;re going on vacation he always asks if we&#39;re leaving in the middle of the night and if we&#39;re not he&#39;s very disappointed!<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Unschooling Conference in SC- Question","postDate":"1051370476","msgId":65895,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMi4wLjkuMC4yMDAzMDQyNjA4MTAyMS4wMjZmYTJiMEBtYWlsLmdhaWF3b2xmLm9yZz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFQUFBQUM0LjQ0QkQwOTM1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE5YS4xM2FiNTI2NS4yYmQzMjJiZEBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDBmZDAxYzMwYjllJDRkNjAyMjMwJDdhNGIzYjQxQEhlYXRoZXI+IDw1LjIuMC45LjAuMjAwMzA0MjYwNDQzMDEuMDBhY2NiYzBAbWFpbC5nYWlhd29sZi5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":65893,"nextInTopic":65909,"prevInTime":65894,"nextInTime":65896,"topicId":65842,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There aren&#39;t too many unschoolers in our community (well, that&#39;s <br/>\na gross understatement; aside from ONE other family we only recently met, <br/>\nthere are NO unschoolers that I know of!).  Although my son is completely <br/>\ndedicated to unschooling, he is surrounded by either school-at-homers or <br/>\nkids who go to school full time. Either way, most of his friends are <br/>\nconventionally parented with food and other restrictions as well as <br/>\npunishments and time-outs and all the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the many, many reasons the conference was so cool, one thing that <br/>\nsticks out clearly for me was that my son got to be around kids and their <br/>\nparents whose experiences were similar to ours.  It was great for both of <br/>\nus to be around kids who were being parented with compassion and <br/>\nrespect.  It was great to see older kids who had been unschooled and were <br/>\nbright and interested and interesting.  Of course, that was no surprise for <br/>\nme, but it was still good for me to see with my own eyeballs, and I know it <br/>\nwas good for Liam, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotwithstanding the ability to sit out on a patio drinking wine and talking <br/>\nwith no concerns of kids, I wouldn&#39;t dream of going there without my son <br/>\nbecause it was such an affirming situation for him as an unschooler.
