It<br/>\nis exactly the kind of comments where debate turns into attack that have<br/>\nkept me from posting.  It&#39;s not exactly that I&#39;m not brave enough to post.<br/>\nI&#39;m just not up to being used as someone else&#39;s figurative punching bag -<br/>\nwhen one becomes the focus of an attack turned personal, sometimes it&#39;s even<br/>\nharder to stay/get out of the fray.  I personally enjoy hearing other&#39;s<br/>\nopinions - it opens my mind to seeing/understanding certain issues even<br/>\nmore.  I doubt if anybody holds to an opinion believing it to be completely<br/>\nwrong.  I know no one who enjoys being bullied or pistol-whipped into<br/>\nchanging their opinions.  Even &quot;facts&quot; often prove nothing conclusively as<br/>\nthey can be interpreted differently at times.  I&#39;d like to see the list<br/>\nreach the point that a few posts back and forth on an issue are enough to<br/>\nsatisfy us all that we&#39;ve been heard, whether we&#39;ve convinced anybody else<br/>\nof our position or not.  I do get weary of someone trying to prove oneself<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; on every issue regardless of the cost to the peace, dignity, and<br/>\nrespect of the atmosphere of the list and of individual posters.  Let&#39;s keep<br/>\nthe debate healthy and welcome dissenting opinions and additional facts<br/>\nwhere relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nO.K.  - anyone out there, go ahead and take your best shot, as I don&#39;t<br/>\nintend to respond.  No, I&#39;m not chicken. Yes, I&#39;ve said all I want to say on<br/>\nthe issue.  Yes, I will read your opinions with interest (well,to a<br/>\npoint-LOL), and it really won&#39;t be a problem for me if you disagree.  I do<br/>\nnot feel compelled to pound this into the ground until I quote umpteen<br/>\nwebsites, books, articles, personal experiences, or experts until I&#39;m sure<br/>\neveryone knows how right I am or how right I think I am. ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24076,"nextTopicId":24095}}
