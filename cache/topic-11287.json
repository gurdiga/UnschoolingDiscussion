They are small, they have more<br/>\nbutter fat to their milk if you want to make cheese and butter.  They are<br/>\nmore people friendly and usually become family pets.  You can usually find<br/>\nthem for sale advertised as &quot;family&quot; cow.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to milk twice a day minimum for several reasons.  One, they<br/>\n&quot;fill-up&quot; on a twelve hour cycle.  They are creatures of habit.  They don&#39;t<br/>\ncare about daylight savings time or anything else.  When it is the a.m.<br/>\ntime you choose, they will be standing there waiting for you and the same<br/>\ngoes for the p.m. time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get milk you need to raise a calf.  We usually leave the calf with the<br/>\ncow for the first week and then bottle feed it.  A good cow will give more<br/>\nmilk than a calf can use.  Seperate them and start the calf on pellets and<br/>\nhay as soon as possible and then all the milk is yours.  If you get too<br/>\nmuch milk, that is great feed for a pig.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get tired of doing the milking thing, then you can usually turn a<br/>\nJersey into a nurse cow and foster calves on her every 3 to 4 months and<br/>\nhave an ongoing source of income selling the calves.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Tracy Oldfield &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] cows<br/>\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, July 18, 2000 6:04 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is something I&#39;ve thought about, not in terms of caring for one <br/>\n&gt; myself, but would it be feasible to milk cows more often than the <br/>\n&gt; usual dawn and dusk scenario?

That means if we go on vacation I would have<br/>\nto find someone to come milk the cow. Also, it is a<br/>\ntechnique that has to be learned. There is a rythm to<br/>\nit.
