He<br/>\nquite literally didn&#39;t want to read, and didn&#39;t see a need to read at that<br/>\npoint. In fact, he hated those beginner reader books.  We would get the<br/>\nbooks he wanted from the library and he would pore over illustrations and I<br/>\nwould read them to him. He could understand them, just not read them. It was<br/>\ntoo hard to try to read at that level. We also did LOTS of books on tape<br/>\n(still do) and used our cable tv, videos, local museums, and whatever else<br/>\nseemed appropriate. This boy learned massive amounts of stuff he was<br/>\ninterested without reading a single word. Then he discovered Pokemon and all<br/>\ntheir related guide books. Now that was a reason to read!!  He reads with no<br/>\nproblem. He is not particularly interested in reading fiction, he would<br/>\nrather do fiction in audio form. But if he needs information, he can read<br/>\nanything he wants now.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a>&gt; www.reachhomeschool.com<br/>\n<br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art!     &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com/\">http://www.artkunst23.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.artkunst23.com\">http://www.artkunst23.com</a><br/>\n&quot;Know where to find the information and how to use it - That&#39;s the secret of<br/>\nsuccess.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955)<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Pamela<br/>\nSorooshian<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 09, 2005 3:11 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Learning shouldn&#39;t be work<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>\n&gt; of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>\n&gt; experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>\n&gt; you have to read, read books that he is interested in. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please do not make him wait until he can read fluently before he can  <br/>\nlearn/do other things.

I&#39;m afraid that if I just stop<br/>\n&quot;teaching&quot; him, that when other people find out he can&#39;t read they<br/>\nwill make a big deal about it. I&#39;m afraid that this will make him feel<br/>\ndumb and damage his self-esteem.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nClue #2---it&#39;s about mom, NOT the child. I think his self-esteem is damaged already. He already feels dumb---<br/>\nat least dumber than his sister.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nAt home, it is not a big deal. I have always emphasized that everybody<br/>\nhas things they are good at and things that are harder for them. He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have any problem with the fact that his younger sister can<br/>\nread better than he can because HE knows how to invent things and<br/>\nbuild things.

Contrasting&#39;s NOT?<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nI want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>\nof the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>\nexperiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>\nyou have to read, read books that he is interested in. <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nClue #4. It&#39;s not about the LEARNING. It&#39;s about the READING.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>\nit being work?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nClue #5. Learning is play. AND learning IS work. But the work is worth it if you want it enough. In fact, <br/>\nthat hard work is pleasurable!<br/>\n <br/>\nYou use Rod and Staff, so I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re Christian. <br/>\nYou&#39;ll listen to others more than you listen to your own children.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone else is understanding where you&#39;re coming from. You DON&#39;T want to become an unschooler.<br/>\nYou want to know how to get him to read.<br/>\nOK. My suggestion will probably work in your situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nBan reading. Forbid it.<br/>\n <br/>\nHis trust in you is broken already. If you forbid it---don&#39;t allow it in any way, shape or form, I&#39;m <br/>\npretty sure he&#39;ll jump right on it as most kids who have such restrictions do.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo more reading.

It is not AT ALL  unusual for children to<br/>\nbe 9 or 10 years old before they  learn to read or have an interest in<br/>\nputting effort into the task.     But if they have developed an aversion or<br/>\ninternalized really confusing &quot;stuff&quot;  because they were forced before they<br/>\nwere developmentally ready,   then they may well be older before starting<br/>\nand will also take longer to develop competency.     Of course, even some<br/>\nwho are not forced will not focus on it until older than 10 anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been my strongly held belief for decades that we cause a lot of our<br/>\n&quot;reading disabilities&quot;   or  &quot;permanently behind grade level&quot;  readers by<br/>\nthe recent obsession of &quot;teaching&quot;   reading starting in kindergarten (or<br/>\neven younger).      <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said,  yes I do understand that it can be scary in a book oriented home<br/>\nto have a child not finding pleasure or competence in reading.  When my<br/>\nolder son went from non reading at age 9 to high school level by age 10,<br/>\nit seems I &quot;should&quot;  have learned something.   But when his brother was also<br/>\na &quot;late&quot; (by SOME  folks standards)  reader,   I still worried.     Worrying<br/>\nmay be just the nature of mommies,  but it really is in our children&#39;s best<br/>\ninterests to not let that worrying push us into pushing them!. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSince your son already has a reading aversion and probably considers himself<br/>\nnot quite smart .....your task is to assure him that the time will come and<br/>\nhe will be able to read even better than his current age peers.  And that in<br/>\nthe meantime you are available to help him with ways to &quot;compensate&quot;  for<br/>\nhim not having that particular skill yet.     For example,  reading to him<br/>\nor answering questions or getting audio tapes.    Don&#39;t mistake  forcing<br/>\nteaching sessions on him as &quot;helping&quot;.   He is a child who wants to<br/>\nlearn.....but learning to read may not be what he needs at present.     How<br/>\nunfortunate to place that as a barrier preventing him access to <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.:  You could utilize the time that is  freed up for both him and<br/>\nyourself by doing away with   reading &quot;lessons&quot;  for him  by instead having<br/>\nlots of reading sessions for yourself (if that IS  a means that YOU  learn<br/>\nby)   in order to come to an understanding and, more importantly,  an<br/>\ninternalized belief,   that what is needed for your son to learn is for you<br/>\nto stop putting obstacles in his path.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S.:  That sounded harsher than I really meant.  It IS  hard,<br/>\nparticularly if your own experience was reading early and enjoying reading,<br/>\nBut to label as a child as &quot;doesn&#39;t want to learn&quot;   is extremely harsh. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Angela<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 08, 2005 11:29 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] What do you do with a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI say give him time and space.

Learning how to read is very hard for him so he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do it and it is not at all enjoyable for him. He wants to<br/>\nlearn how to read but he doesn&#39;t want to work. <br/>\n***I am 32 years old and I don&#39;t like to do things that are not at all enjoyable for me. Can&#39;t you just wait until he wants to learn to read? Let him play his video games, he will catch on to the reading thing fairly quick. Mine did. Buy comic books, graphic novels and the like. My son, Jack is 9.5 he loves to read Shonen Jump. It has episodes of all different Japanese anime in each issue. But if I had a curriculum with set books to read at set times and ages, I know Jack wouldn&#39;t read at all. It wouldn&#39;t be what he is interested in or what he cares about. Do you read things that don&#39;t interest you or that you don&#39;t care about? My husband and daughter love science fiction, I don&#39;t touch most of it. Give me a good detective or medical novel and I&#39;m happy, combine the two and I&#39;m in heaven. True stories, historical fiction, I&#39;m all over it. Anime and manga, don&#39;t care for it or understand much of it, but I see the art in it, I see the time and creativity. Just because it is or isn&#39;t in<br/>\n a curriculum doesn&#39;t mean it is or isn&#39;t worth reading. And just because someone isn&#39;t reading at 8, doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t be reading at 9 or 10 or 13 or even two weeks from now. Maybe the curriculum doesn&#39;t interest him? Why don&#39;t you just put it away and wait until he finds something that he is captured by and then he will learn to read because he is ready.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I don&#39;t have a problem with using a curriculum and giving my<br/>\nchildren assignments (which is why I&#39;m not an unschooler) but I do<br/>\nhave a problem with making them do something that they don&#39;t  at all<br/>\nenjoy or otherwise get no benefit from.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***I guess on an unschooling list this statement won&#39;t get you too far, because all I can see, advice wise coming from this list, is throw the curriculum away. If he isn&#39;t enjoying it, isn&#39;t benefiting from it, why keep at it?***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I want my son to learn how to read. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n*** He will, on his own, in his own time, when he is ready.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>\nof the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>\nexperiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>\nyou have to read, read books that he is interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***When he really wants to do those things, and sees that he needs to be able to read to accomplish some of the more intricate games, and experiments then he will learn to read. In the mean time can&#39;t you just read to him?***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without it being work?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***You can&#39;t, and it won&#39;t not be work. You can help him to be ready to read by making all of his opportunities  meaningful to him. And sometime in the next few weeks or months or years he will read. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Learning shouldn&#39;t be work","postDate":"1131481049","msgId":109401,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxYi4yMmVjOTNkLjMwYTI2MWQ5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":109400,"nextInTopic":109402,"prevInTime":109400,"nextInTime":109402,"topicId":109376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My answer has been to cleave more to the much smaller community<br/>\nof real Unschoolers around me, and step away from the negative judgmental<br/>\nfolk.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; make him feel dumb and damage his self-esteem&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs compared to being basically judged as lazy &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nwork&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the most important person in his life - his mother.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>\nof the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>\nexperiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>\nyou have to read, read books that he is interested in. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThose computer games are paths to reading that many parents have observed<br/>\ntheir children joyfully taking - without the lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy aren&#39;t you reading to him from these sources? He doesn&#39;t NEED to read<br/>\nright now to get all the learning and interests and fun that he wants, IF<br/>\nyou (or one of his sisters) would be willing to read TO him (ie on his<br/>\nbehalf) for the time being. Are you expecting him to be reading some &quot;learn<br/>\nto read&quot; boring garbage from your curriculum before being permitted to use<br/>\nthe other interesting TO HIM materials?<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if you needed reading glasses, and accidentally broke them. Until a<br/>\nnew pair could be purchased, wouldn&#39;t the loving family members want to help<br/>\nby reading for you? People would not be judging you for not being able,<br/>\nphysically, to read - and they would know it was temporary.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; So how can I help him learn how to read? How can he learn how without<br/>\nit being work? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy you backing off, reading anything HE wants to know the content of for<br/>\nhim, allowing him all the time he wants to play on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\nYahoo!

How do <br/>\n&quot;pre-schoolers&quot; learn to sing?   They sing.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was in an acting class and was assured by her teacher (who was wrong) <br/>\nthat if she couldn&#39;t read, she couldn&#39;t act.   Holly knew there were actors who <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t read.   She knew about babies and toddlers, but what she didn&#39;t know <br/>\nwas that even some adult actors are so dyslexic and so school-damaged that <br/>\nthey get help with their scripts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom an article called Three Readers that was in Live Free Learn Free <br/>\nmagazine, about Holly, quoting myself until this line comes again<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s a girl, and girls are verbal, and girls read earlier, I thought.   By <br/>\neight, when Kirby had been reading, Holly wasn&#39;t even nearly so.   By nine, <br/>\nwhen Marty had read, nothing. I wasn&#39;t as worried as I would&#39;ve been had she <br/>\nbeen my first, and that was good for her.   At ten, though, Holly started to <br/>\nworry because other homeschoolers she knew were reading and she wasn&#39;t.   Younger <br/>\nkids were reading.   One family was using her as a bad example (&quot;You need to <br/>\ndo these lessons so you won&#39;t turn out like Holly, who can&#39;t even read&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of incidents greatly expanded what I had known before, though, and <br/>\nhave changed my entire view of late readers.   Holly was in a summer dance and <br/>\ntheatre &quot;camp,&quot; a five day all-day set of sessions.   I told the teachers she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a reader and requested they not ask her to read aloud.   They were <br/>\nusing the book Barn Dance for the production, so we bought a copy a couple of days <br/>\nbefore, and I read it to her several times. By the performance, some kids <br/>\nhadn&#39;t memorized their assigned verse, but Holly had memorized hers and everyone <br/>\nelse&#39;s too.   (The same thing happened in a play later.   She couldn&#39;t be <br/>\ndependent on a script she couldn&#39;t read, and ended up memorizing the whole thing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that year, she joined girl scouts, and I told the leaders she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nreading.   A schooled friend of hers offered to help her, but the &quot;help&quot; <br/>\nconsisted mostly of reminding the other girls and Holly that she, the friend, had to <br/>\nhelp Holly read.    Because that was the first time in their lives the friend <br/>\nhad been a step ahead of her, Holly let it slide. .   There was a presentation <br/>\nfor parents one night.   While the other kids were reading off paper, <br/>\nmispronouncing “Juliet Lowe,” mumbling and covering their faces, Holly&#39;s portion of <br/>\nthe program was clear, involved eye contact and her own words<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was eleven, I wrote this: <br/>\nHolly wasn&#39;t reading at ten. She wasn&#39;t happy about it, either. She is at the <br/>\npoint now where she is reading words without meaning to. For fun she tries to <br/>\nwalk around the house without recognizing any words. At eleven, she&#39;s still <br/>\nnot reading chapter books. But if you met her and talked to her you wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nthink for a second, &quot;I bet this kid doesn&#39;t even read,&quot; because there&#39;s not much <br/>\nshe can&#39;t talk about, and if she knows nothing about it but it sounds <br/>\ninteresting, she&#39;ll ask intelligent questions.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThough Holly wasn&#39;t reading, her vocabulary was sophisticated and she was <br/>\nfascinated by the history of and connectedness of words.   When she did start to <br/>\nread, she had no reason to use easy books.   She was still eleven when she did <br/>\nher first real reading, a Judy Blume novel.    She read two of those, and <br/>\nmoved on to Steven King&#39;s novelette The Body.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she had only been reading a couple of months, we were sitting down to <br/>\nwatch &quot;TheTwilight Zone,&quot; Holly reached over to move the Tank Girl comic books <br/>\nshe had been reading.   One was called &quot;The Odyssey.&quot;   Then the DVD menu came <br/>\nup, and one of the episodes was &quot;The Odyssey of Flight 33.&quot;   She commented on <br/>\nit, and I said &quot;You saw the word &#39;odyssey&#39; twice in an hour?   Cool!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;I saw the word &#39;odyssey&#39; twice in one MINUTE!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is fourteen now (fourteen now (as of last Wednesday) and you would <br/>\nnever, ever know she &quot;read late&quot; if you met her, talked with her, or she discussed <br/>\nwhat she was reading or had cause to read something aloud.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than press your son to do what he&#39;s not ready to do, you could ask <br/>\nthat he bring the sheetmusic home, and go through it with him so he will know his <br/>\nlines.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":230706843,"authorName":"Betsy Hill","from":"Betsy Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Learning shouldn&#39;t be work","postDate":"1131479575","msgId":109395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNzEwMjE3LjQwNTA0MDdAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrcXU0OSs3cm1oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRrcXU0OSs3cm1oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":109392,"nextInTopic":109396,"prevInTime":109394,"nextInTime":109396,"topicId":109376,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** So how can I help him learn how to read?

I recently read a book that I think was mentioned on <br/>\nthis list, Hold On To Your Kids by Gordon Neufeld. One thing I took <br/>\naway from that book was that the relationship between parent and child <br/>\nis more important than &quot;discipline.&quot; Neufeld recommends that if a <br/>\nparent is having problems with a child&#39;s behavior, that the parent set <br/>\naside ideas of discipline and instead make an effort to connect more <br/>\nfully with the child. He bases it on the idea that kids will learn <br/>\nbehavior from the people they identify with, and as parents, we want <br/>\nthat to be us. So strengthening the connection should be the goal, not <br/>\nachieving certain kinds of compliance from a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be very hard for me to have a child of 8 or older who didn&#39;t <br/>\nread (mine are still younger than that). I would worry, I&#39;m sure, that <br/>\nhe would never learn, that certain pleasures wouldn&#39;t be available to <br/>\nhim. I&#39;d worry about what others would think. I&#39;d be on this list, and <br/>\nothers, all the time, begging parents of kids who started reading when <br/>\nthey were 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 to tell me the stories again...&quot;one more <br/>\ntime, your kid is doing OK? Everybody, help me see how great he&#39;s <br/>\ndoing!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would also try to avoid labeling him as a kid who &quot;didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nlearn.&quot; Is your son interested in other things, just not in learning to <br/>\nread? Kids are learning all the time; what learning can you see <br/>\nhappening for him now? What is positive about your relationship? What <br/>\nmight happen if you set aside teaching him to read for six months, just <br/>\ndecided not to worry about it until X date, and watched how relaxing <br/>\nthat pressure on you and him affected your home life and relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was worrying--foolishly, I knew at the time--a few months ago because <br/>\nmy 4 yo didn&#39;t seem as skilled at counting as other kids his age I <br/>\nknow. I had to discipline myself not to push the issue. And suddenly, <br/>\njust lately, I&#39;m not even sure when or how, he started counting past <br/>\n10, experimenting with addition, subtraction, and multiplication (&quot;if <br/>\neach doll has two legs, how many legs do four dolls have?&quot; is a <br/>\nquestion he spent some time working out last night).

If you were unschooling you<br/>\ncould relax and enjoy your son doing activities that were fun to him<br/>\ninstead of needing him to achieve a certain level of reading<br/>\ncompetence in order to do those activities a schooled life requires. <br/>\nIf you were unschooling your son (and your other 7 children) you<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be judging him based on a timetable that your other children<br/>\nmay or may not have adhered to.  If you were unschooling you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nspend hours trying to get him to love reading by forcing him to do<br/>\nreading assignments, instead you could cuddle up with him and read<br/>\nbooks, or read information to him from the internet that you thought<br/>\nwould interest him or that he&#39;d asked about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can imagine how frustrating it must be for him to have his mother<br/>\ntelling him that he must read. I am sure he knows that his sister who<br/>\nis 18 months younger is reading.  I imagine that makes him feel dumb.<br/>\n I am sure he knows that his not reading is frustrating to you.  Maybe<br/>\nwhat you see as a lack of desire is less a lack of desire, and more a<br/>\npassive rebellion.  When I have pushed Simon to do something he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to, he doesn&#39;t yell or freak out, he just shuts down: he<br/>\ntakes on what I would describe as a bored face, and crosses his arms<br/>\nand looks away. And in that minute of gentle, absolute refusal my<br/>\nfirst response is anger and frustration and then I laugh at myself and<br/>\nI apologize for pushing him. But that took a while to get to. However,<br/>\nit was never a lack of desire on his part, no matter how it felt in my<br/>\nmoments of frustration.  It was an unwillingness to continue mixed<br/>\nwith a feeling of powerlessness.  He couldn&#39;t stop my insistence, but<br/>\nhe could keep from being part of his own subjugation.  So, now, when I<br/>\nfind myself pushing him and I see him retreat into himself I back off<br/>\nand I apologize and I change the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor whatever reason you&#39;ve decided not to unschool your children.  <br/>\nHowever, I would suggest that you look at your son and look at all he<br/>\nis capable of, including his reading.  Don&#39;t look at him in<br/>\ncomparison, don&#39;t look at him with a curriculum in mind, just look at<br/>\nhim as the person he is and find everything in him that you love.  And<br/>\nnext time he isn&#39;t all that you need him to be as you sit down to do<br/>\nyour Rod and Staff curriculum think about all that he is that is good<br/>\nand that is wonderful. And maybe wonder if the Rod and Staff<br/>\ncurriculum isn&#39;t all you need it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mommyof7plus1&quot;<br/>\n&lt;scraven@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just subscribed to this list, although I have lurked on the list in<br/>\n&gt; the past.

My son&#39;s <br/>\n11.  At that age I read a lot, and I read big enormous adult books.  My <br/>\nson isn&#39;t like me.  He reads a lot less than I do, and less complex <br/>\nstuff than many of his peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I had an encouraging conversation with some of my eclectic <br/>\nhomeschooling friends at the park.  Among my close circle of friends <br/>\n(not a big enough sample to prove anything) it seems to be common for <br/>\ngirls to devour lots of books and for the boys (7 years - 11.5 ) to seem <br/>\nto read only *comic books*.  My son is enthusiastic about reading <br/>\nGarfield, Foxtrot, Calvin and Hobbes, Tintin, Asterix, and Star Wars <br/>\ngraphic novels.  The important part of that sentence to me is &quot;my son is <br/>\nenthusiastic about reading&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is absolutely normal for children to vary widely in when they start <br/>\nreading.  (The way schools are designed does not acknowledge that <br/>\nfact.)  I believe that pushing reading can badly confuse a child that <br/>\nisn&#39;t ready.  Readiness depends on brain development.  (Also on eye <br/>\ndevelopment -- I do have a friend whose 11 year old just learned to read <br/>\nafter having &quot;vision therapy&quot;.)  Brain and eyes and heart all have to be <br/>\nready for great reading skills to develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son really likes having me read to him (when he&#39;s not busy playing), <br/>\nand listening to books on tape.  He finds that reading the text himself <br/>\ninterferes with his ability to visualize it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo encourage interest in reading without pushing, I&#39;d have really fun <br/>\nbooks in the house (yes, comic strip books), and appealing magazines <br/>\nthat encourage browsing and looking at the pictures.  Some people have <br/>\nfound that sheet music (or printed lyrics) of a memorized song can help <br/>\nsupport a developing reader.  But readiness is everything.  Kids who <br/>\naren&#39;t ready to read at the age reading lessons start in school can <br/>\nreally suffer and feel ashamed and miserable.

What I mean by this is that an unschooler would not be<br/>\npushing their 8 year old to read before he is ready, many homeschoolers<br/>\ndo.  I highly suggest that you give your son space and freedom and stop<br/>\npushing him to learn to read.  If you continue to push, it will probably<br/>\nbackfire.  Your son may eventually learn to read but he will not enjoy<br/>\nit, thus will probably choose not to read as he gets older.  It will be<br/>\na constant battle for you until you can let go.  I know this first hand<br/>\nbecause I let go and I promise you that it benefited everyone.  <br/>\n <br/>\nInstead of pushing him to read, help him to appreciate reading!  You can<br/>\ndo this in several ways but make sure it is not contrived or coerced.<br/>\nYour son will catch on if you do this with an agenda in mind and again<br/>\nit will backfire.  I highly recommend that you read to him. Maybe he<br/>\nloves Harry Potter or Star Wars.  Find a nice comfortable place to sit<br/>\nand snuggle while you both escape into a fun and exciting world.  Also,<br/>\nshow him how enjoyable reading can be by reading yourself.  Do you read?<br/>\nDo you get excited about a new book coming out?

If you still find you only agree somewhat, <br/>\nany advice you receive here will only be &quot;somewhat&quot; useful.  Nobody here <br/>\nwill be able to help you &quot;make&quot; your son read.  They can offer advice <br/>\nfor ways for you to relax that demand ... they can reassure you that he <br/>\nwill read as soon as he finds it necessary and important to what he is <br/>\ndoing ... they can counsel you that reading doesn&#39;t have to look like <br/>\ndecoding certain books on demand and doing grammar exercises.  They <br/>\nwon&#39;t help you &quot;school&quot; him -- buit they can help you UNschool yourself <br/>\n-- and your son.  Is that the kind of help you are looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have been struggling with homeschooling my 8yob. I recently posted<br/>\n&gt;about it on some traditional homeschooling discussion boards and I did<br/>\n&gt;not recieve much help. Many of them struggle with similar issues but<br/>\n&gt;no one has much in the way of solutions for the problems. I have come<br/>\n&gt;to the conclusion that many homeschoolers &quot;live their lives in quiet<br/>\n&gt;desperation&quot;. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Many of those who school at home DO live their lives in quiet <br/>\ndesperation.  Those who live in an unschooling way (and make no mistake <br/>\n-- it becomes a LIFESTYLE if you do it properly) live in discovery and <br/>\nhappiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOWEVER, the transition between the two can often be far more vexing <br/>\nthan school at home was in the first place, as you struggle with <br/>\neverything you have ever been told, your children still do not <br/>\n&quot;perform&quot;, and your husband wonders what the heck happened.  Once you <br/>\nhave fully made the jump, you can find a richness of existence, but it <br/>\nusually does not come overnight.  SO be prepared! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be rewards, but they won&#39;t look like your son begging to do <br/>\nextra units in Rod and Staff.  They come in increased peace; a relaxing <br/>\nof your fears; stronger, more healthy relationships;  less yelling; <br/>\nexcitement at finding connections between interests  -- that kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyhow, I would like to know how unschoolers would relpy<br/>\n&gt;to the following post: <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, many homeschoolers *have* replied to similar posts.  If you <br/>\nsearch the archives, you will find a wealth of advice, ranging from <br/>\nSandra&#39;s essays to others who chime in.  It has been written about quite <br/>\nfrequently.  This is a fairly common problem, and likely one of the top <br/>\nreasons people look to unschooling.  So you are not alone!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you want an answer you can start with right away.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have the post numbers at my fingertips, but just put &quot;read&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;can&#39;t read&quot; or whatever in the search feature at the website, and you <br/>\nwill be given many helpful approaches.  Once you read them, you will be <br/>\nable to ask specific questions.  Anybody have the link to Sandra&#39;s and <br/>\nJoyce&#39;s pages about reading?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;I&#39;m about at my wits end with my son. He is 8 and a half and can<br/>\n&gt;barely read at a 1st grade level. Schooling him is very difficult<br/>\n&gt;because he has no desire to learn how to read. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Schooling ANYONE is very difficult.  If you are &quot;lucky&quot;, you get a <br/>\ncompliant child who will &quot;go along&quot; with what you have been offering, <br/>\nbut if you are truly *blessed*, you get a child who questions, who <br/>\nteaches YOU how to re-evaluate everything *you* have &quot;gone along&quot; with <br/>\n... who challenges you to find a more meaningful way of learning, of <br/>\nteaching yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;His sister is 18 months<br/>\n&gt;younger and they are both doing Rod and Staff first grade but her<br/>\n&gt;reading ability is at least 2nd grade level because she reads books on<br/>\n&gt;her own initiative and comes to me to ask what a word is so she is<br/>\n&gt;learning on her own. My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>\n&gt;own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I LOVE to read.  I find I need a ration of so many printed words a day, <br/>\nor I start getting edgy and reading cereal boxes, if that is all that is <br/>\nhandy (happened on our last camping trip when I forgot my book bag).  I <br/>\ndefinitely need input on a frequent basis, but I would complain about <br/>\nany reading anyone MADE me do.  I like to be able to choose what, when, <br/>\nand how I read -- in frantic gulps, or leisurely sips.  Fiction or non.  <br/>\nIn the tub, while making dinner, or in the middle of the night because I <br/>\ncan&#39;t sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>\n&gt;them how to read. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, what you did was provide five of them with the information, <br/>\nand they *chose* to learn how to read.  Either they were ready and <br/>\nreally wanted it, or else they had nothing better to do.  Either your <br/>\nson is *not* ready, or *doesn&#39;t* want it, or he *does* have something <br/>\nbetter to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever his reason for resisting, you can&#39;t make him learn to read.  <br/>\nInstead, you can find out what he *is* interested in, what he *is* ready <br/>\nfor, what he wishes he were doing instead.  Then you can see if there&#39;s <br/>\nsome way he would like you to be involved in that (providing materials, <br/>\nplaying with him, reading to him, whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>\n&gt;desire to learn. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your son also has a desire to learn.  It is your job to sit back, and <br/>\nlovingly figure out WHAT he wants to learn if you want to be part of his <br/>\njourney, or to at least get out of his way so he can accomplish what he <br/>\nis after if you don&#39;t want to quash his own determination out of him.  <br/>\nLove of learning is very difficult to restore.  Trust in a relationship <br/>\nis fairly difficult to mend.  Backing off and seeing his direction and <br/>\nfitting yourself in is WAY easier, and much more fulfilling in the long <br/>\nrun -- to both of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;want to learn <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Neither does anyone else.

When there is a  <br/>\nrequirement that children must read by a certain age, then it is a  <br/>\nproblem if they aren&#39;t reading by then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following is going to be hard for you. It is going to turn all  <br/>\nthat you think you know about what kids need in order to learn upside  <br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you remove the artificial requirement that he be reading now, then  <br/>\nthere is no problem. If you remove the necessity to learn only (or  <br/>\nprimarily) through reading, then there is no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is not the be all and end all of learning. Other ways of  <br/>\nlearning are not distant seconds to reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat reading is to learning is an efficient way for one teacher to  <br/>\nget information into a room full of kids. Schools depend on kids  <br/>\nreading *not* because it&#39;s best learning method but because it makes  <br/>\nschools run efficiently. (Even teachers will say the best way to  <br/>\nlearn is by doing. And unschoolers would add doing what they love and  <br/>\nare curious about. But can you imagine one teacher being able to  <br/>\nmanage a room full of kids learning by doing when she needs to  <br/>\ndemonstrate they learned x, y, and z by the end of the school year?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no reason to try to recreate school at home when the methods  <br/>\nschools use are meant primarily to make schools run and secondarily  <br/>\nto show that learning is happening (happening long enough to be  <br/>\nregurgitated for a test).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers do not depend on reading for their kids to learn. *And  <br/>\nunschooled kids learn just fine.* The learning that unschoolers do  <br/>\nlooks *different*. It looks like play. But it is not only just as  <br/>\neffective, it&#39;s *more* because kids are absorbing what fascinates  <br/>\nthem in ways that are natural to their personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids are allowed to read when they want to, when they find it  <br/>\nmeaningful for them, when their brains are developmentally ready,  <br/>\nwhen they have pleasant associations with reading then kids do learn  <br/>\nto read. It happens usually between 6 and 8 but can be earlier and  <br/>\ncan be later. Thirteen is not an unusual age to learn to read. (Kids  <br/>\nwho learn at 13 are not 7 years behind in skills. They quickly are  <br/>\nreading at age level.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time they are learning *just fine* in other ways:  <br/>\nlistening to people, talking, watching TV, listening to music, doing  <br/>\nthings hands on, *analyzing*, *making connections* and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>\n&gt; own and he complains about the reading that I make him do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you continue to make him read, continue to make the experience  <br/>\nwith books unpleasant for him, you will have the exact same problem  <br/>\nschools do: he will either decide there&#39;s something wrong with him  <br/>\nand he can&#39;t read, or he will decide that reading is dumb and he  <br/>\nnever wants to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>\n&gt; them how to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what schools think they do too. But unschoolers don&#39;t teach  <br/>\ntheir kids to read and their kids learn to read anyway. So there&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething else going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s going on is that learning to read is no more difficult than  <br/>\nlearning to speak. (I suspect it&#39;s quite a bit easier!) Learning to  <br/>\nread happens when reading is a natural, useful (to *them*) and  <br/>\nunstressful part of their environment: signs, video games and gaming  <br/>\nguides, stories, movies based on books, books on tape and so on and  <br/>\nso on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just a guess but it seems to fit what unschoolers see with  <br/>\nchildren. There seem to be a number of brain areas involved in  <br/>\nreading. Not all of them mature at the same rate and those brain  <br/>\nareas are also used for things other than reading. When a child isn&#39;t  <br/>\nreading by 12 what makes sense is that one of those brain area is not  <br/>\nready. They&#39;ve been using the other brain areas involved in reading  <br/>\nfor other things so they&#39;re all up and running. And when that last  <br/>\nbrain area is mature then wham the kid&#39;s reading. It doesn&#39;t always  <br/>\nhappen that way, but it does for a fair number. For others it&#39;s more  <br/>\ngradual but once they&#39;re brains are ready (and their experiences with  <br/>\nreading have been positive) they go from not reading to reading at  <br/>\nage level within a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>\n&gt; desire to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Girls tend to be more verbally oriented. They do on the whole tend to  <br/>\nlearn to read earlier than boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers would say look at who he is rather than who is is not and  <br/>\nrather than holding him against the yardstick of who you want him to  <br/>\nbecome. If you can look at him as being perfect at being 8 rather  <br/>\nthan an imperfect adult you will help both of you and your  <br/>\nrelationship and his learning tremendously. If you see that each day  <br/>\nhe is learning how to be 8 years + 1 day and then 8 years + 2 days  <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s 9 and he will be a perfect 9 year old, then you won&#39;t be  <br/>\nstruggling against who he is right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you treat him as doing the best he can -- after a period of  <br/>\ntransition since he&#39;s been absorbing the message that he&#39;s not as  <br/>\ngood as you want him to be for a long time -- he will do the best he  <br/>\ncan. He will still make mistakes but they will be honest mistakes of  <br/>\na growing person who is trying to figure out the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to learn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You and every teacher in school!

Even in school, in<br/>\nthe same class, there are children who can read and children who cannot read<br/>\nat the same level or not at all.  The children who can&#39;t keep up with the<br/>\naverage get sent to remedial reading and often end up feeling stupid and<br/>\nincapable of learning to read.  It can be traumatic.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; My son will not pick up a book and read it on his<br/>\nown and he complains about the reading that I make him do.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are now 9 and 10 and neither one of them reads books regularly.  It<br/>\nis amazing to me how they have taught themselves to read however and how<br/>\nthey have continued to get better at it without ever reading a book.  They<br/>\nread on the computer, and in stores, on boxes, and catalogs, email, etc.  My<br/>\n9 yo has read one chapter book in her life and my 10 yo has not read any.<br/>\nThey are both good spellers and writers even though they don&#39;t enjoy reading<br/>\nvery much.  They still love to have me read to them.  They love books on<br/>\ntape.  They have amazing vocabularies.  I am not writing this so you can<br/>\ncompare your child and think he isn&#39;t measuring up.  I am writing it to let<br/>\nyou know that reading will happen for him in time if you support his<br/>\ninterests; keep him surrounded with print and make reading a joyous thing.<br/>\nRead to him often.  Help him write emails to his grandmas on his own email<br/>\naccount if he&#39;d like it.  Play games with him and help him when he needs<br/>\nhelp reading for them.  Buy him magazine that are about his interests.  Read<br/>\nthem TO him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have eight children (he&#39;s the only boy) and I have taught five of<br/>\nthem how to read.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two children that I helped to learn to read by answering their<br/>\nquestions and helping them when they wanted the help.  I take no credit for<br/>\nteaching them.  They just learned and it was amazing to me.  They did it<br/>\nwhen they were interested and at their own speed.  They are fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;Some learned faster than others but they all had a<br/>\ndesire to learn. I simply do not know how to teach a child who doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to learn and frankly, the struggles with my son are ruining<br/>\nhomeschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can teach someone anything that they aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>\nIt just doesn&#39;t work that way.  You can force them to memorize something for<br/>\nthe test, but it isn&#39;t real learning.  I say give him time and space.  And<br/>\nhe may need more time now after trying to force him before he was interested<br/>\nand ready.  Good luck.<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\nYahoo!

I will say upfront that I am not an unschooler although I do<br/>\nsomewhat agree with the philosophy of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been struggling with homeschooling my 8yob. I recently posted<br/>\nabout it on some traditional homeschooling discussion boards and I did<br/>\nnot recieve much help. Many of them struggle with similar issues but<br/>\nno one has much in the way of solutions for the problems. I have come<br/>\nto the conclusion that many homeschoolers &quot;live their lives in quiet<br/>\ndesperation&quot;. Anyhow, I would like to know how unschoolers would relpy<br/>\nto the following post: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m about at my wits end with my son. He is 8 and a half and can<br/>\nbarely read at a 1st grade level. Schooling him is very difficult<br/>\nbecause he has no desire to learn how to read. His sister is 18 months<br/>\nyounger and they are both doing Rod and Staff first grade but her<br/>\nreading ability is at least 2nd grade level because she reads books on<br/>\nher own initiative and comes to me to ask what a word is so she is<br/>\nlearning on her own.
