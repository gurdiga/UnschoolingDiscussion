June 24th-27th (more or less it&#39;s up to you - you can even just come out for one day - My family is staying three nights Thurs-Sat and then packing it up on Sunday)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere? Lake Jacomo (between Lee&#39;s Summit and Blue Springs, MO) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? To hang out with other unschooling families, visit, play and relax. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else can we do? You can fish, visit the bird watching center, hike, swim at the beach and/or take a paddle boat out. (not sure of the prices of the extras yet like beach and paddle boats yet). <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much? $10 for a basic tent site, $15 for electricity, $22 for full hook ups a night. I was told there are no reservations and it&#39;s first come first serve. I was also told that the park is really only busy on holiday weekends. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny scheduled events? I would like to have a potluck dinner on Saturday night (26th) and anyone that wants to come out and join us can. I think I may rent a shelter for that night with a ball field. Maybe we can have a big kick ball or wiffle ball game? <br/>\n<br/>\nDirections? I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet. But will keep everyone posted. I need to drive out there and make my own map.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRSVP? Please let me know if you plan on coming ASAP even though there are no reservations if this gets too big I may need to look into a bigger camp ground. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions or Suggestions? email me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jane@...\">jane@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nUpdates? I will keep everyone updated about the extra cost of the beach, paddle boats and exactly how to get there ASAP. I will also send out updates about the RSVP list so you can see if your friends are planning on attending. <br/>\n<br/>\nLake Jacomo Info:  <br/>\n60 sites (10 Full Hookup/38 Electric/12 Tent)  If we need more room than that Longview is bigger but has very little shade. <br/>\nSeason: April 1 - October 31, Full Service<br/>\nLocation: I-470 to Colbern Road., East 2.4 miles to Beach Road, North 1/2 mile<br/>\nCosts: FH: $22, E: $15, T: $10<br/>\nLarge, tree-lined sites, attendant, showers, restrooms, laundry, fishing pond, firewood, ice, picnic table, fire grill. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just found out this is going on that weekend and called about it. They couldn&#39;t tell me much other than most people don&#39;t camp and are there partying on their boats. We won&#39;t be camping right next to the lake we will be a few miles away but the fireworks might be cool. :) The person I spoke with thought it was free for anyone that does want to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nJune 26<br/>\nLake Fest 2004<br/>\nLocation: Lake Jacomo<br/>\nTime: 5:00 p.m. - Fireworks<br/>\nPrice: TBA<br/>\nPhone: (816) 795-8200, Ext. 1272<br/>\nJackson County Parks and Recreation has more in store at Lake Fest 2004.
