None of those things <br/>\nwould be a big deal to me either. And I really want to know that even the <br/>\nteenage years can be as wonderful as the younger ones. I don&#39;t want to hear <br/>\nproblem stuff. I guess for me it would be if I found out my child was lying <br/>\nto me about things. I just see so many homeschoolers here still go through <br/>\nall the junk a lot of teenagers do that are in school. I really haven&#39;t seen <br/>\na lot of them do better. Now I also know homeschoolers that seem like really <br/>\ngreat kids with no issues like some, at least it seems that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is that I generally don&#39;t have any doubts or <br/>\nquestions at all that unschooling is the best way to go. But at the same <br/>\ntime, when I think of my 3 youngest hitting the teen years, I can&#39;t help but <br/>\nwonder if things will be so different for them then what I went through <br/>\nbefore. I know the circumstances are very different and I&#39;m counting on <br/>\nbeing right.

Undieting <br/>\nimplies no longer being a slave to diets,   the diet industry, and anything <br/>\nthat has a disclaimer &quot;results not typical&quot; after showing how thin and <br/>\nbeautiful you can be with their product or plan.

We have some &#39;friends&#39; (or perhaps I should say<br/>\n  acquaintances) who pride themselves on how strict they are as parents.<br/>\n  We know them through church and they really don&#39;t have any friends. It&#39;s<br/>\n  easy to see why because they&#39;re quite obnoxious. Somehow they&#39;ve decided<br/>\n  we&#39;re their friends though. My husband is pretty tolerant and<br/>\n  non-judgmental towards people, and so I think that is one of the ways<br/>\n  they&#39;ve wormed their way into our lives. We had them over for dinner<br/>\n  once and all the kids were eating at the kitchen table while the adults<br/>\n  took their plates and sat in the living room. The mother went back into<br/>\n  the kitchen after a while and bopped their kids on the head&#39;s for no<br/>\n  reason at all and then sat there and proceeded to give it to them until<br/>\n  they cleaned their plates totally. My daughter (who is almost 5) was<br/>\n  really shocked at how this woman was acting towards these children. She<br/>\n  has a real keen sense of fairness and of how people should be treated. I<br/>\n  could see her wheels just turning while this woman was basically on the<br/>\n  war path with their kids. The adults had dished up the kids food and my<br/>\n  daughter said, &quot;In our house we don&#39;t have to eat it all if we&#39;re full.&quot;<br/>\n  The woman was quite taken back and basically told my daughter she ought<br/>\n  to use good manners.
