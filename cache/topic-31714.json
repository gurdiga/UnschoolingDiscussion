Whether it is taking out the trash or turning off<br/>\nthe tv it is control if the parent decides.  But I think there can be some<br/>\ntype of middle ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  We have 5 kids (11, 8, 5, 3, 2).  With the kids working on their<br/>\nprojects, making their snacks, playing, things can get very messy very<br/>\nquickly here.  I can spend all my time cleaning up but I would be a grump.<br/>\nWe work more on the basis of commitment to the group or family.  If what you<br/>\nare doing only effects you, fine no problem.  If it effects others, then<br/>\nagreements need to be made.  Adriane has a room to herself so she cleans up<br/>\nas she sees fit.  Zach and Danny share and Zach is the ultimate slob, a very<br/>\ncool slob but slob none the less.  It gets to where Danny can&#39;t even find<br/>\nhis toys under Zach&#39;s dirty underwear.  I suggested that when we can no<br/>\nlonger see the floor, Zach pick up his stuff and he agreed.  Zach and Marsie<br/>\nlove &quot;midnight snacks&quot; but were leaving crumbs and dirty dishes all over the<br/>\ntable.  I asked them to clean up after themselves and they said fine and do<br/>\na really good job.  Use of the home and cleaning of the home often effect<br/>\nmore than just the individual, watching television usually doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespect is a 2 way street and unless living alone, it is pretty much<br/>\nrequired for a happy home.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"Julie Stauffer","from":"&quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1780","postDate":"1012197971","msgId":31714,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMxYTdjMSRlYjk3YjdjMCQwMWE2YjFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTIxODMxOTEuMjE2OC41NDM4Lm0zQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31716,"prevInTime":31713,"nextInTime":31715,"topicId":31714,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Hi Sharon, I was just thinking of you and Roy yesterday and how much fun we had meeting you guys.
