She was doing wonderful potty-training at <br/>\nabout 2.5 yrs old. But then all of a sudden she stopped going poop in <br/>\nthe potty. Held it forever, then would cry and cry when she had to <br/>\ngo. My dh and I were going crazy. Nothing seemed to work. Even took <br/>\nher to emergency room one day because she was in such pain. To make a <br/>\nlong story short, ended up seeing a specialist. She gave me the best <br/>\nadvise ever. Started giving her 2 tablespoons of mineral oil a day. <br/>\nCoats her insides with out any side effects (ok, just one.. she could <br/>\nno longer hold her poops inside when she wanted to.) Put her back <br/>\ninto diapers because the poop would also start coming out orange in <br/>\ncolor and ruining her pants. It took a while, but I am very happy to <br/>\nsay that she is 6 and does not have any more problems and no <br/>\npermanent damage. When she feels that her bowel movements are getting <br/>\nhard to come out, she tells me and she will take the mineral oil on <br/>\nher own (one quick swallow).
