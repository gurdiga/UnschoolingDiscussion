The study took people coming out of inpatient<br/>\ntreatment for alcohol addictions and looked at how successful they were for<br/>\nstaying sober.  People were either sent to 12 step programs and had that<br/>\nreinforced by weekly visits with 12 step counselors....or were simply given<br/>\nresults of medical tests indicating what alcohol was/is doing to their<br/>\nbodies at weekly visits with medical counselors....or had individual<br/>\ncognitive behavioral therapy sessions on a weekly basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was discovered is that it didn&#39;t matter what aftercare treatment the<br/>\nperson had (12 step, medical or therapy) or the severity of the alcohol<br/>\naddiction, the success rate was about the same across those variables.  What<br/>\nmattered was where the person was in their process of change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process of change consisted of several stages starting with<br/>\ncontemplation, moving through investigating options, and ending with taking<br/>\nsteps to make change.  It was found that the source of change appears to be<br/>\ninternal rather than caused by outside forces, such as treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, December 27, 2003 3:19 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4304<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a lesson in here somewhere. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I deleted too quickly and don&#39;t remember who mentioned it -- but &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seems like that study might be linked to this business of what motivates<br/>\n&gt; people to be early or late -- maybe.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nance<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/26/2003 6:53:09 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; Date: Fri, 26 Dec 2003 12:46:29 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Radical v Regular<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It was the appalling idea of letting down the entire school if I was not<br/>\n&gt; there. The &quot;insurmountable misadventures&quot; (fantastic phrase!) just<br/>\n&gt; evaporated. I actually became so anxious to be on time, that I was<br/>\ngenerally<br/>\n&gt; extra early.
