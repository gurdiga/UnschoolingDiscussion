When you re active in a community and you speak out and get involved, etc., there","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2101585311\">I&#39;ve gotten good, over the years, at ignoring what isn&#39;t said right to <br/>\nme. When you&#39;re active in a community and you speak out and get <br/>\ninvolved, etc., there will be people who won&#39;t like you and they&#39;ll <br/>\nbadmouth you behind your back, so I accepted that and I really just let <br/>\nit slide when I hear about it. Same with criticism of my children. &quot;I&quot; <br/>\nknow my kids. &quot;I&quot; know what they&#39;re really like. My kids didn&#39;t always <br/>\nbehave perfectly - they had to grow and learn like anybody else. But I <br/>\nknew they were on a good path - their trajectory was good. Same with <br/>\nmyself - I screwed some things up along the way, didn&#39;t always live <br/>\nperfectly up to my own standards. But I&#39;ve been on a good path, too, and <br/>\npart of that path is acceptance of not being perfect, of being a <br/>\nlearning human, not a finished product.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - when someone criticizes your kids - why not take a good look at the <br/>\ncriticism. Don&#39;t take offense, put aside the defensive feelings. Just <br/>\nlook with eyes wide open at how much of it is true. Look at what the <br/>\nsource of the criticism is. Is it petty jealousy? Is it defensiveness on <br/>\ntheir part that you&#39;re not doing things their way? Do they feel <br/>\nthreatened? Or, is there a teensy bit of truth in it? Are YOU worried <br/>\nabout the path your children are on? It is all right for the children <br/>\nnot to be perfect - if someone has picked up on some imperfection in <br/>\nyour child, it is okay to respond (even if just to yourself), &quot;Yeah, <br/>\nthat&#39;s not the best thing about Johnny, but he&#39;s on the path to <br/>\nimproving in that area.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes other people think we&#39;re not really helping our kids do <br/>\nbetter. They see us as lackadaisical rather than supportive. For <br/>\nexample, I had a daughter who would get very frustrated easily and have <br/>\nlittle explosive meltdowns, when playing with friends. It wasn&#39;t cool - <br/>\nnot for her friends, but also not for her. It was something she was <br/>\nworking on and I was helping her, but that wasn&#39;t obvious to her friends <br/>\nor their parents. I would never chastise her, which is what some parents <br/>\nand their kids wanted to see. I&#39;d comfort her and sometimes they would <br/>\nthink that was encouraging and rewarding her behavior. I had a few <br/>\nparents say, &quot;You need to make her stop that.&quot; Or they&#39;d say, &quot;You <br/>\nshould not let her get away with that.&quot; Sorry - but those were just <br/>\nstupid comments by ignorant parents whose OWN kids didn&#39;t turn out all <br/>\nthat great, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a matter of confidence. I think the way to become <br/>\nconfident enough to handle criticism effectively (hearing it without <br/>\ndefensiveness, evaluating it, using what might be good information, <br/>\nignoring the rest) is to read and read and read about unschooling and <br/>\nparenting and get such a deep understanding and sense of it that other <br/>\npeople&#39;s remarks just seem obviously off base.<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt sometimes like someone was saying, &quot;The sky is red today,&quot; and <br/>\nI&#39;d look at the blue sky and it would be obvious to me that they were <br/>\nwearing red-tinted glasses and didn&#39;t know it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: why is my child being criticized?","postDate":"1257451718","msgId":113243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2NDhFMzFELUM1MDMtNDY4OS1BM0NELUI4NTFBMjY1REE1QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjc2VuNitydWZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhjc2VuNitydWZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":113242,"nextInTopic":113244,"prevInTime":113242,"nextInTime":113244,"topicId":113239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I m disheartened because I have a feeling I m going to be drifting away from some friends that we have had for years just because I m choosing something","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-211030121\">-=- I&#39;m disheartened because I have a feeling I&#39;m going to be drifting  <br/>\naway from some friends that we have had for years just because I&#39;m  <br/>\nchoosing something other than the &quot;norm&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat happens.<br/>\nIf you look at it from the other side, though, if your friends will  <br/>\nonly like you if you&#39;re neglectful and abusive of your children, it&#39;s  <br/>\nan easier choice.  :-/   I&#39;ve lost some friends and kept some, but  <br/>\nthey would&#39;ve been gone from my life eventually anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest turned 18 three days ago.

We&#39;ve had numerous talks about schooling and our family&#39;s best interests with her included.  Yet when parents and her friends make comments to her, &quot;well so-and-so is going to go to school, she(my daughter) HAS to stay home with mom instead&quot;- it disgusts me that that is what is said to and in front of my child.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s so wrong with staying home with mom- and her sister for that matter?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am very strong in my front about scholing or unschooling my children and do not waiver in my beliefs no matter who I am speaking too.  But why do parents believe it is okay to talk about our situation in that tone only to have their children repeat it?  I never once say to my child so she can repeat it- you get to stay home instead of school- while they HAVE to go to school.  Because in my opinion nobody HAS to do anything.  We all have a choice whether it is recognized or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I face this social dilema.  I am able to handle my end of the critism and defensive views from others who choose public school- but how do I let my little one, who has such a tender heart, know that she&#39;s not missing out on anything?  She&#39;s very social but does take every bit of negativity to heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else faced this dilemna with friends that not only do not homeschool but don&#39;t talk kindly about it either?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113081,"nextTopicId":113246}}
