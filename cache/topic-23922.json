When you drink a lot frequently, you don&#39;t get as drunk, almost like building an immunity.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother-in-law fell down at the state fair a couple of days ago and broke his nose, requiring eight stiches. He has bruises and lacerations all over his face. Everyone in the family knows he was drunk, but his wife (also a drunk) neglected to mention that fact when she called to say why they wouldn&#39;t be attending a family birthday party. They both, the sil especially, are capable of drinking enormous amounts and not appearing to be intoxicated. I&#39;m tired of the charade and of the powerlessness the rest of us feel about their situation. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Susan, btw, and have been on this list for a long time. I often have to delete several days worth of digests at a time, though, so I haven&#39;t contributed much--I can&#39;t always count on being able to follow a discussion all the way through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two daughters, 18 and 21.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan  (hiya, Sandra!)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23794,"nextTopicId":23910}}
