Is he feeling better? That&#39;s wonderful!!! Thank you for sharing that.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was never one to complain or give voice to things that made him unhappy-- <br/>\nBut there were lots of obvious signs of stress and resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can give an example that might be telling:<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to nag him all the time about leaving his dirty socks in the living room.  He ALWAYS left them on the floor in the living room no matter how often I reminded (nagged) him to put them in the laundry basket.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night after snuggling my boys to sleep I was tidying up the living room while he watched a movie.  I was humming quietly and every now and then we chatted a bit about what he was watching, or things that happened during the day (we never used to chat much- he&#39;d focus on his movies or his phone after work and not seem to see or hear or take note of anything else- and I often Inconsiderately interrupted what he was doing to get his attention) at home and at the repair shop he works at, and sharing some funny things off our Facebook news feeds for the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I finished cleaning I gave him a kiss and went to bed.  The next morning I got up and saw his socks laid neatly at the door of the playroom/office (the laundry basket is in there).<br/>\n<br/>\nSix months ago I would have been pissed that he made the effort to get them that far, but not open the door and move another four feet to toss them in the basket.  Now, I saw that, my heart melted a little, I smiled and thought, wow, he&#39;s never done that.  And I didn&#39;t even ask him to not leave them in the living room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat, and he&#39;s had more patience with our boys.  When I extended abundance and sweetness and generosity to include him, and started taking his thoughts on what the kids should or shouldn&#39;t be doing into account, it made a huge difference in his mood.  He laughs a lot more and is sweet with the boys more than he used to be.  He even gave me Some awesome advice the other day when I was having a struggle with our 4 yr old over a game we were playing.  That&#39;s so unlike what it was like before (a few months ago he probably would have stomped out of room without a word).<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have things to work on.  But it&#39;s definitely been a huge improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thank YOU.

But in some ways I was raised really, really differently than my brother by dint of our different genders. He was given tools, invited into my dad&#39;s workshop, shown how to work on motors, supported when he wanted to build and explore with hammers and saws and wrenches. I was pushed away from those things. If I wanted to use a hammer, I had to use my dad&#39;s or my brother&#39;s - and I Did use hammers and saws and wrenches, but only ever got lukewarm responses to my efforts. I was 21 before my dad gave me tools as a gift - but he did every year for my brother, birthday and xmas.&nbsp;<br><br>So I was relegated to the kinds of projects and tools I could create and fabricate and snitch on my own - which often involved string or paper, fabric or cardboard because those were readily available to me. And yet I was also discouraged from &quot;doing crafts&quot; because &quot;you can&#39;t make a living with stuff like that&quot;. In an attempt at feminist support, my dad even told me that I should actively avoid doing &quot;traditionally feminine activities&quot; because it would undermine my future success. He was trying to help! He even tried to stop me from taking a typing class so I wouldn&#39;t be &quot;railroaded into a secretary&#39;s job&quot;. I did it behind his back. I did crafts behind his back, too - which meant I couldn&#39;t show him the things I built or ask for technical support. Eventually I found my way into fiber arts and working with my hands for a living by turning my back on my parents&#39; advice and following what I enjoy doing - and found I&#39;m very good at hands on problem solving, good at creating and building and fixing... like my grandfather and father and brother. In a sense, biology won out over my upbringing to an extent.

She was born and raised as a boy. And unlike the more commonly told stories of MTF transfolk, she wasn&#39;t attracted to &quot;girl stuff&quot; as a child, she was a &quot;tomboy&quot; - like me only she was also Physically a boy. So she was treated as a boy. She was given tools and invited into dad&#39;s workshop and supported as being &quot;very much a boy&quot;. And she grew into a teenage boy who liked normal teenage boy things like car and guitars - and being a very creative, hands on problem solver, started Building guitars. And working on cars. And building cabinetry. All very normal hands-on boy things... which has made coming out as trans really difficult in a lot of ways because in many ways, being raised male &quot;fit&quot; with who she was. And now she&#39;s one of a very few female professional artisan guitar builders... in part because she was raised to be a boy.

but it might not be *just* genetics - because, again, they were indeed both raised - and who&#39;s to say how much influence that raising had, even if the influences, or even the similarities, weren&#39;t obvious to the researchers (or the twins) :-)</div><div><br></div><div>So when it comes to raising my son, and to unschooling, I figure he has a certain genetic make-up that will probably inspire certain traits, or habits, or behaviors. &nbsp;I can&#39;t do much about that - genetically speaking, he is who he is, as a result of his genetic connection to my side of our family, and to my husband&#39;s side of our family. &nbsp;A pile of DNA and other stuff :-) came together, and produced the 10 year old who is sitting right now in the other room by the Christmas tree, playing Legos. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What I can influence greatly is the environment in which his genes and his DNA play around in, for however long in his life he lives with us. &nbsp;I can provide a happy home, full of toys and games and interesting things to explore. &nbsp;I can take him places, support his interests, talk with him, listen to him, and respect who he is as a person. &nbsp;I can offer him a loving environment, devoid of punishment, threats, and yelling. &nbsp;I can fill him up with good memories, so that when he strikes out into the world in his adult life, he will be building on what he already has, and (hopefully :-)) not seeking to destroy or rebel against or forget where he came from.</div><div><br></div><div>To me, in part, unschooling takes the genetic component and makes it, perhaps (and I don&#39;t mean this in a bad way :-)) less important. &nbsp;Unschooling says to kids that whoever they are -

There are all kinds of parings that don&#39;t involve mutual attraction.  And how much of that is a genetic somehow or strictly environmental?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would guess that the ability (or inability) to sustain a loving relationship, or grow into one deeper and more committed than lust has to do with the environment one was raised in.  Even then, I wasn&#39;t raised in a relationship-promoting environment, far from it.  And yet I have been focused much of my life on cultivating friendships and relationships- with limited success at times- complete failures at others- I&#39;ve sought resources to help myself with that and my relationships have improved dramatically- even with people I was totally at odds with a year ago (previous and more recent exchanges with my mother in law come to mind in that category of &#39;dramatic improvement&#39;).

Reading what you folks have to say about relationships and spouses has helped me and I now feel (really feel- deep in my heart) totally differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking, my mom was an only child of a very psychologically unstable mother and her dad died young- she intentionally had lots of kids because she hated feeling lonely as a child (it didn&#39;t turn out to be a good solution for her loneliness, but having lots of siblings in a range of ages certainly did something for mine, and for my social skills, that she couldn&#39;t have provided- so she provided better for her children in that way than what she had).  You could say that was her reacting to her environment- or are we somehow genetically programmed to do those sorts of things in response to our environment?<br/>\nSo far all 5 of my siblings seem to be having major difficulty with relationships.  But they&#39;re all younger than I am, and may be that will change.  Is that genetics at play, or have I somehow ended up in a more conducive environment?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is that odd combination of wanting to belong and conform, mixed with enough rebellion and mistrust of caregivers that allows people to seek out something different they were raised with strictly environmental?  Somehow I dont think so.  I imagine there are people who were raised without having to mistrust or doubt their caregivers who still seek out something different.  Is it a genetic-conditional-on-environment thing? I have no idea, but whatever it is, I&#39;m inexpressibly grateful for it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Brain development and parenting","postDate":"1386358911","msgId":72727,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3OTBFNzVELUNBNjktNDk4Mi1BNEM4LTRDRjlDRDFBRUE2RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGw3dDJvZSsxN3E2dG1lQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGw2dWRlMSsxOW9rcTBmQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDE2QUJCMEIyLTYyRkYtNDc3Mi04MjI1LTdGN0Q1OTY0RUREN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDc5MDBGMTQwLUVBQTEtNDM5My1CNzMxLUEzNDFGOTBGRDYxM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPGw3M2plbCtxMGo0bjVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUMwNDY3RjktOTMxRC00RTY4LUJCRTgtMDA4RjU0NzkwN0YxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8bDc3ZnRwKzFnZXVwNjRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8RUYzQzhFQTgtODlGMS00MTI1LUJGNDMtMEU2QjQ5OUY1RTNCQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8bDdhdmZzKzFnZGgxcThAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bDd0Mm9lKzE3cTZ0bWVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72726,"nextInTopic":72728,"prevInTime":72726,"nextInTime":72728,"topicId":72623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This post goes to a dark place, so don t read it if you re having holiday stress and need to keep cheery. -=-  We don t have much control over genetic factors","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-742202062\"><html><head></head><div>This post goes to a dark place, so don&#39;t read it if you&#39;re having holiday stress and need to keep cheery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>-=-<span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;We don&#39;t have much control over genetic factors - except whatever may come into play biologically when two partners select one another for reproduction (and how much of that is influenced by the environment partners find one another in?).&nbsp;-=-</span><div><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Much of &quot;your father and I loved each other very much&quot; is sugar-coating the past. &nbsp;LOTS of kids are born whose parents did not &quot;select one another for reproduction&quot; in any sort of conscious way, but just rutted like any other animals in heat for a few minutes and discovered pregnancy as a by-product later.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><font face=\"times new roman, new york, times, serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:19px;\">In any such case, even if the parents stay together, I wonder whether that affects the environment in which the child grows up?

Frankenstein&#39;s creation blames Frankenstein for all that he is, all that he has become. That it is entirely the fault of one&#39;s maker. I haven&#39;t read Mary Shelley&#39;s book, I&#39;ll get it today, hopefully, so I don&#39;t know how much she lays at the feet of the creator or how much was Nick Dear&#39;s take with Danny Boyle&#39;s spin on her stor. It reminded me of Dr. Fallon&#39;s brain, of the idea that psychopathy is a brain pattern that doesn&#39;t have to be expressed. Frankenstein&#39;s creation was unhappy, was angry, was badly treated and lay all the blame of his monstrous behaviour at the feet of the father who created him and then abandoned him. I don&#39;t know it that was a fair cop, or not. I do know that I believe that environment plays a very large role in who one is, who one becomes, even if the general shape of a personality is defined by genetics&gt;&gt;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\">The creature blames his &quot;genetics&quot;

The type of &quot;puzzles&quot; we&#39;re each drawn to is genetic. Puzzles meaning stuff that needs figured out for understanding. Also what type of understanding we&#39;re each drawn to is genetic.</div><div><br></div><div>Part of my talk for Sandra&#39;s symposium last year was about how it&#39;s hard to tell a child&#39;s adult career interests from *what* they do as a child. Of the thousands of unschooled kids who were passionate about Pokemon, very few have ended up with careers in gaming. Or animal training. Or &nbsp;bug catching ;-) That&#39;s because Pokemon tapped into a deeper passion than what is seen on the surface. A passion that connects to a particular way of organizing and understanding the world.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you could look inside and see *why* a child is interested in what they&#39;re drawn to, you would see several common threads running through their interests. And those threads will continue throughout someone&#39;s life. They&#39;ll just take different surface forms. There are genetic reasons why one person prefers the Stones to the Beatles, Star Trek to Star Wars, fantasy to contemporary fiction. IT&#39;s not &quot;just because&quot; that&#39;s what they like.</div><div><br></div><div>For me looking back, I can see the common threads between Nancy Drew, Star Trek, drawing people, D&amp;D, homemade Man from UNCLE trading cards, writing stories, engineering, explaining unschooling, creating writing prompts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I suspect for people who showed little interest in musical instruments when younger but picked it up later it&#39;s because they can now see the type of puzzle in the instrument that interests them. They have greater experience in life. They have more mature brains that can see connections that it couldn&#39;t before. Kat did have violin lessons when she was 5. It didn&#39;t last long. She couldn&#39;t see the type of puzzle she likes to solve in it. But by the time she was 16 she could see the instrument differently. She could see the type of puzzles in it that interested her.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think the label &quot;musical&quot; is causing confusion. Ten people&#39;s ability to play a song doesn&#39;t mean they have anything in common other than being able to play that song ;-) What interests someone, what draws them to something is what&#39;s important. A fiddle player might have more in common with what sparks an interest in them with a car mechanic than another fiddle player. A fiddle player who can play from sheet music and a fiddle player who can make up songs may both be labeled musical but their brains might not have as much in common as their choice of instruments indicates.</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Brain development and parenting","postDate":"1385644793","msgId":72649,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw3N2Z0cCsxZ2V1cDY0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFDMDQ2N0Y5LTkzMUQtNEU2OC1CQkU4LTAwOEY1NDc5MDdGMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGw2dWRlMSsxOW9rcTBmQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDE2QUJCMEIyLTYyRkYtNDc3Mi04MjI1LTdGN0Q1OTY0RUREN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDc5MDBGMTQwLUVBQTEtNDM5My1CNzMxLUEzNDFGOTBGRDYxM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPGw3M2plbCtxMGo0bjVAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MUMwNDY3RjktOTMxRC00RTY4LUJCRTgtMDA4RjU0NzkwN0YxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":72647,"nextInTopic":72650,"prevInTime":72648,"nextInTime":72650,"topicId":72623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me to attempt to play the fiddle, even if I had been remotely interested in that particular instrument, until my chance encounter at the age of 21. When somebody subsequently showed me how to scratch out a few tunes, I realised from the evidence of that experience that musicianship is a skill, something learnable and improvable, and that I&#39;d been lied to (or perhaps, to be more accurate, ignorant people had passed their ignorance on to me). It was a huge revelation. I didn&#39;t have that much of an aptitude for the instrument, I was good enough. Even that took a lot of hard work. My playing is actually much improved since I started again earlier this year and the reason for that is YouTube videos, an amazing resource unavailable in the 1970s.</div><div><br></div><div>I may have been interested in violin lessons at the age of five or something like that if I&#39;d been aware of that as an option.

Frankenstein&#39;s creation blames Frankenstein for all that he is, all that he has become. That it is entirely the fault of one&#39;s maker. I haven&#39;t read Mary Shelley&#39;s book, I&#39;ll get it today, hopefully, so I don&#39;t know how much she lays at the feet of the creator or how much was Nick Dear&#39;s take with Danny Boyle&#39;s spin on her stor. It reminded me of Dr. Fallon&#39;s brain, of the idea that psychopathy is a brain pattern that doesn&#39;t have to be expressed. Frankenstein&#39;s creation was unhappy, was angry, was badly treated and lay all the blame of his monstrous behaviour at the feet of the father who created him and then abandoned him. I don&#39;t know it that was a fair cop, or not.\n I do know that I believe that environment plays a very large role in who one is, who one becomes, even if the general shape of a personality is defined by genetics,otherwise it wouldn&#39;t matter all that much what I chose to do as a parent as Simon and Linnaea would be who they are with or without my engagement.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Schuyler</div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></div>  </div></div>                     \n                            </span></blockquote></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":296562751,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;naomicfisher@...&gt;","profile":"naomicatharinefisher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"RE: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Brain development and parenting","postDate":"1385496952","msgId":72646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw3MnVycitxMHRyYTFAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc5MDBGMTQwLUVBQTEtNDM5My1CNzMxLUEzNDFGOTBGRDYxM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGw2dWRlMSsxOW9rcTBmQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDE2QUJCMEIyLTYyRkYtNDc3Mi04MjI1LTdGN0Q1OTY0RUREN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPDc5MDBGMTQwLUVBQTEtNDM5My1CNzMxLUEzNDFGOTBGRDYxM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":72645,"nextInTopic":72647,"prevInTime":72645,"nextInTime":72647,"topicId":72623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think there is no clear answer to the question of how heritable (or dependant on genes) variation in behaviour is because it depends on the environment the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-178777400\">I think there is no clear answer to the question of how heritable (or dependant on genes) variation in behaviour is because it depends on the environment the child is in. In some environments behaviour will be more heritable than in others.\n\nThis is easiest to visualise with regard to height, even though that isn&#39;t behavioural.\nHeight is highly genetic. In an environment where everyone has adequate nutrition, almost all variation in height will be due to genetics and it will be highly heritable. However, in a variable environment where some people have enough to eat and others don&#39;t, height will vary for environmental reasons and so will be less heritable - some people with tall genes will be short due to poor nutrition, for example. \n\nSo with behaviour, if we were comparing lots of unschooling families who provided lots of loving support and choices for their children, we would expect variation in behaviour to be highly heritable. But if we were comparing a full range of families, some of whom abuse or neglect their children, we would expect variation in behaviour to be less heritable, as the environmental constraints  will limit genetic expression.  Even a someone with the genetic potential to be a concert pianist has to have access to a piano (and enough time when they aren&#39;t struggling for survival) at some point in their life in order to be able to reach that potential.  \n\nThere is also the complication that the individual to some extent creates their environment - there was some interesting research a while back suggesting that even siblings in the same family cannot be said to share the same environment because, by choosing friends and how they spend their time,  siblings  can inhabit very different environments.  So it can even be argued that given enough choices, your environment is another expression of your genes.  \n\nSo my hypothesis for a study of unschooled children would be that variation in behaviour would be highly heritable, as they have more choices and chances to influence their environment than other children do, and are hopefully in environments which do not constrain the expression of their genetic potential.  But that does not mean the environment is not important - it is precisely because of the environment being good that the heritability is high. A good enough environment means that most variation in behavioural traits would be down to genetics and not environment. \n\nSorry I do not have links to studies - I did some postgrad study in this area but the articles I used are from subscription only journals and I no longer have access to them. \n\nNaomi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Brain development and parenting","postDate":"1385474551","msgId":72637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5MDBGMTQwLUVBQTEtNDM5My1CNzMxLUEzNDFGOTBGRDYxM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2QUJCMEIyLTYyRkYtNDc3Mi04MjI1LTdGN0Q1OTY0RUREN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGw2dWRlMSsxOW9rcTBmQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDE2QUJCMEIyLTYyRkYtNDc3Mi04MjI1LTdGN0Q1OTY0RUREN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72636,"nextInTopic":72640,"prevInTime":72636,"nextInTime":72638,"topicId":72623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the question isn t as clear as it seems.

There are also people who play the violin well who have put in 10,000 hours without even realizing it just because their genes are such that they enjoy the challenge of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the surface, judging by ability to play the violin, they both seem musical.

Some aggressive people are shamed for showing aggression. So they keep their feelings bottled up inside to put on a non-aggressive face in public. Some people aren&#39;t aggressive so naturally respond in supportive-of-others ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf each of them can act supportive, does that mean they&#39;re all non-aggressive?

He nodded and said he figures it&#39;s about 90%.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m crap with numbers and it was dark.  he might&#39;ve said 80%.  I think he said 90%.  In any case, it was nowhere near 50%.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople used to teach that environment was all of it, and it was considered really evil, racist, classist, horrible, to consider genetics at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days it seems to me, looking back at everyone I&#39;ve ever known :-) , and twin studies I&#39;ve read and seen video reports about, that probably the Reverend Samuel Siroky was correct.   But given a person&#39;s natural inclinations, they can be made meaner or nicer by the way they were brought up, or by the way they are treated in later life, maybe, some, too.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThat last part I know from the rat studies of the 1960&#39;s where researchers bred mean rats, and nice rats for a few generations of selection (a few rat generations, not a few hundred years), and then gave some very nice environments and some very cramped environments without enough food, and compared behavior.     As you would expect, Nice+nice was  nicest.  Mean+crummy was worst.  But the real contest was for second and third place.  They showed meann rats in nice enironments to be more peaceful than nice rats too crowded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose studies were used to encourage schools to be nicer to kids, and by architects and city planners and prison wardens and psychologists advising families on giving kids more room at home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of movies, one a creepy drama, and one a comedy (not suitable for all young children).  The Bad Seed (1956) is about bad genetics and is not uplifting.   Trading Places (1983) is about a bet placed between millionaire futures traders about nature vs. nurture.  It&#39;s a Christmas movie (kind of), and has Dan Akroyd and Eddie Murphy, so there&#39;s a draw. :-)   And partially naked, young Jamie Lee Curtis, in case you want to persuade a husband to watch with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not worth getting unhappy about (this genetics business) but it&#39;s probably worth keeping in mind if you have an ex-husband a kid who&#39;s really pissing you off.  I have a friend who was in a situation like that.  He grew up to look like and sound like his father, and his mom pretty well hated his father.  Awkward.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Brain development and parenting","postDate":"1385347329","msgId":72623,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGw2dWRlMSsxOW9rcTBmQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72630,"prevInTime":72622,"nextInTime":72624,"topicId":72623,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is only tangentially related to unschooling, I think.
