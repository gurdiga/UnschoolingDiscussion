The bad study habits I&#39;d picked up made my<br/>\ntransition into university harder than it had to be. My attitude<br/>\nabout learning left me disinterested in pretty much everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can&#39;t quit, right? I mean, everybody goes to school. Only<br/>\nlosers drop out.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot according to a growing group of teens who choose to educate<br/>\nthemselves outside the school system.They call themselves<br/>\nunschoolers, deschoolers and dropouts, among other things. And<br/>\nfor different reasons, they drop out of school, despite<br/>\nstatistics that suggest that dropping out of school can lead to a<br/>\nfinancially hard life.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to high school graduates, dropouts are likely to earn<br/>\nless money, collect unemployment, and receive public assistance<br/>\nand be single parents, according to a 1999 report by the U.S.<br/>\nDepartment of Education&#39;s National Center for Education<br/>\nStatistics.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat these stats don&#39;t measure, however, are the teens who thrive<br/>\nwhen they ditch the school system to take control of their<br/>\nlearning process.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Is Unschooling?<br/>\nFirst let&#39;s clear up a few things - there&#39;s an important<br/>\ndistinction between education and schooling. Education is the<br/>\nactive development of knowledge and lasts a lifetime. Schooling<br/>\nis merely the act of going to school. The idea is this: If you&#39;re<br/>\nfree to use your time, your natural curiosity will lead you to<br/>\neverything you need to know.<br/>\nSchooling can be passive. You sit and receive whatever lecture is<br/>\non the teacher&#39;s syllabus, regardless of what you&#39;re interested<br/>\nin. Attending formal classes is no guarantee that you&#39;re<br/>\nlearning, just as dropping out doesn&#39;t keep you from getting an<br/>\neducation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, unschooling is not homeschooling, where your parents set up<br/>\na school system at home. Unschooling is self-directed education.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can read what they want, volunteer, do internships,<br/>\nor become an apprentice. The can also write a novel, tackle<br/>\nadvanced math problems, go on hikes, or even audit classes in<br/>\ncollege (which are very different from high school classes). The<br/>\npoint is to do whatever they&#39;re excited about.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37794,"nextTopicId":37710}}
