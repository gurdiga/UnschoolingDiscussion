I took my children out of the formal school system <br/>\nabout two months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about home schooling for several years, but didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize that there were so many options for home education. My <br/>\ninitial belief was that home schooling was basically &quot;school at home&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn September, I attended a workshop put on by a woman who has been <br/>\nunschooling her children for several years. I realized immediately <br/>\nthat this format was something that I could commit to and would suit <br/>\nmy children (especially my 12 year old son).<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that came up during the workshop was the notion that the <br/>\nchildren need to go through a period of &quot;uninstitutionalizing&quot; before <br/>\nthey would reconnect with their natural curiosity and motivation to <br/>\nlearn. In this time (which my husband and I were told could last from <br/>\na couple of weeks to as long as six months) it was advised that we <br/>\nnot make any suggestions for the children to do specific learning. <br/>\nRather, we allow the children to develop their own interest in <br/>\nwhatever it is that they are drawn to. (Having read most of John <br/>\nHolt&#39;s books I recognize this as his philosophy)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat my question is: during this period of uninstitutionalizing, do I <br/>\nnot suggest they do any type of learning?? (ie. I do not say ... <br/>\ntoday, you need to read for 1 hour - you pick the book, magazine, <br/>\nwebsite or whatever) Would doing this be directing their learning or <br/>\nis this structure important?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy seven year old daughter seems quite motivated to learn math right <br/>\nnow. She asked me for some math material that would help her practise <br/>\nmultiplication and division. I&#39;m going out this morning to get her a <br/>\nbook! My 12 year old son, on the other hand, seems quite content with <br/>\nhis drama, dance and singing lessons and spends a lot of time on the <br/>\ncomputer installing and playing life simulation games. He is also <br/>\ntaking 2 1/2 hours/week of career technology studies (home ec. & <br/>\nshop) at his former junior high school. He tells me he isn&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in math or science at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would help me to calm myself, if I knew that my experience with my <br/>\nkids is within the realm of what is &quot;normal&quot;.  Thank you for any <br/>\nopinions and assistance you can lend me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDona Baker<br/>\nAlberta, Canada</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30679,"nextTopicId":30758}}
