He ordered his men not to trade useless, <br/>\nbroken trash for the natives&#39; valuable goods. Ordered? or requested? <br/>\nI don&#39;t remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, he also took a whole bunch of Native people back to Spain <br/>\nas slaves...and he also died a broken man, because in reality, he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a leader, but had been granted the governance of the West <br/>\nIndies which position he was not equal to.
