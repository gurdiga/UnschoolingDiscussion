I remember my now 13 year old had a videotaped <br/>\ninterview for PRESCHOOL.  And it was oh-so-important so he could get into the <br/>\nright private school, yada, yada, yada.  Even back then I thought it was <br/>\nabsurd.  You&#39;d think, with New York being so densely propulated, there would be <br/>\nmore unschoolers around for you.  But maybe they are all in the closet.  Not <br/>\neveryone can be so tied to the consumer culture, can they?  Did you see Law and <br/>\nOrder last night (I&#39;m sure it was a re-run).   It was about a $20000 per year <br/>\nkindergarden admissions official who was killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here in midwest suburbia, preschool choice is similar.  Not a legacy, try <br/>\nthis one.  And then there&#39;s the public and catholic school split.  Most folks <br/>\nassume I&#39;m a capital C Christian Homeschooler, which is fine by me.  Others <br/>\nwho actually know me ask questions but really don&#39;t want to know what we do all <br/>\nday.  That&#39;s ok too.  We are closet unschoolers.  When people ask when we do <br/>\nour lessons, I tell them in the morning.  Because I don&#39;t feel like explaining <br/>\nunschooling to a less than receptive audience and because we are not morning <br/>\npeople and would rather not be bothered.  It can only get worse once my oldest <br/>\n&quot;graduates from kindergarden.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to pick up a raw milk delivery the other day and the family that hosts <br/>\nthe delivery out of their sidewalk homeschools.

The idea <br/>\nof homeschooling as a valid educational choice has settled in but the <br/>\nreality of homeschooling is only real to those who do it. It&#39;s like the <br/>\nreality of being gay --yeah, it looks fun on &quot;Will and Grace&quot; but only <br/>\nthose who actually live &quot;the life&quot; know what it really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of this really has to do with most people believing that <br/>\neducation is a consumer&#39;s choice and not part of a way of life. <br/>\nSchoolers look at education as a shopping experience. Deschooled <br/>\npeople, on the other hand, look at it as a way of life. We are like Neo <br/>\nawakened to the reality of the Matrix. Some may say that it is true <br/>\nonly for unschoolers but I really believe that it goes across of the <br/>\nboard, from the left to the right. Stepping out of the mainstream will <br/>\nmake you more aware of it, no matter what your ultimate goal ---hence <br/>\nthe Merovingians in &quot;Reloaded&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why, the other day, afte yet another dumbstruck look, I told my <br/>\nhusband, &quot;now I know why a gay person would choose to stay in the <br/>\ncloset. it&#39;s just not worth the anger.&quot; To which he quipped: &quot;Not gay <br/>\nin NYC.

My kids hated it at first too, well my second oldest did, because at home, he is held to a much higher standard of behaviour, while his learning is at his own pace and based on his own desires. He was without the all-knowing Teacher figure telling him when, where, how to sit, walk, talk, stand, read write, learn.

My children are not perfect, by any stretch, so that&#39;s not a judgement on anyone. (Or, I guess it is, but not a &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; type judgement).  <br/>\nI have a friend who&#39;s son just started Kindergarten. She is constantly praising me on my patience and saintliness (lol). Her son is at school today for his third day in a row and she is marvelling at how well he&#39;s doing. I very gently warned her that some kids (my now 6yo, who did a month in public school, included) are very excited and wonderful for the first little while, but after a few weeks, when the novelty wears off, things may hit the fan. I would never tell her school was bad for her child (although I beleive it is), and I would never tell her to pull him out  (although I certainly hope she does). She says she could never homeschool as she lacks the patience. She could never homeschool because she doesn&#39;t do a lot of reading. She could never homeschool because she needs to go back to work when he goes into Grade One and is full time. Every suggestion...okay argument I make to disprove her theories (?) is met with an &quot;oh, but you&#39;re so patient and such a good mom&quot;. <br/>\nI lost my point again...<br/>\nWendy<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The sheeplike tendency of human society soon makes inroads on a child&#39;s unsophistications, and then popular education completes the dastardly work with its systematic formulas, and away goes the individual, hurtling through space into that hateful oblivion of mediocrity.

Are there <br/>\nsome teachers who love their work and are passionate?  Sure.  Are <br/>\nthere others who suck and need to retire or find a new profession? <br/>\nYes.

Why is it<br/>\n&gt; so hard for people who are so keen on spending time with their<br/>\n&gt; children to understand that, for other people, it&#39;s not what they<br/>\n&gt; want to do? They enjoy their jobs, or they enjoy their time out. Not<br/>\n&gt; all kids are unhappy at school. Some kids love it and would hate to<br/>\n&gt; be at home. I know this list is for home schoolers (we do, home<br/>\n&gt; school I mean) and we love it - but I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it a<br/>\n&gt; few years ago when my career still meant the world to me - as did my<br/>\n&gt; children, but they were happy at school, and I was happy so changing<br/>\n&gt; it wouldn&#39;t have brought us anything better - we would have been<br/>\n&gt; unhappy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *******************************************************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, just because I myself was a good student and absolutely LOVED<br/>\n&gt; school and everything about it doesn&#39;t mean that leaving my kids in<br/>\n&gt; school was the right thing.  Could they have continued on in the<br/>\n&gt; school they were in?  Probably....they weren&#39;t getting bad grades,<br/>\n&gt; except my older son in math, but they were already prepared to give<br/>\n&gt; him some kind of business math course in place of Algebra, so he<br/>\n&gt; could have done OK there.  We could have continued on, but I<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t in good conscience do it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, people who don&#39;t homeschool aren&#39;t &quot;bad&quot; people, but I myself had<br/>\n&gt; to question why I would want to leave my kids in a system that is<br/>\n&gt; squelching their potential, that is literally designed to keep them<br/>\n&gt; from succeeding, to keep them from being free thinkers and from<br/>\n&gt; breaking out of the mold society wants to place them in.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; do it.....I had to give them a chance.  Even if kids in school get<br/>\n&gt; straight A&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t mean school is good for them.

Some children really are revolting at home and lovely at school.<br/>\nSome people just want to do something other than be directly involved in<br/>\nfacilitating their childrens education.

(we&#39;ve been doing it for almost a year). Only on two<br/>\noccasions have people made non-positive comments: the first was in a shop in<br/>\ntown, the sales assistant asked if the DD&#39;s were having a day off school,<br/>\nthey replied in unison, &quot;No, we do home ed.&quot;, the woman looked at me and<br/>\nsaid, slightly sarcastically, &quot;What lesson is this then&quot; (we were buying a<br/>\npresent for a friend), I shot back &quot;Economics.&quot;, she smiled and shut up; the<br/>\nsecond time was a lady at a check out and she so couldn&#39;t get her head round<br/>\nthe idea that I just smiled sweetly and thought it&#39;s probably better for her<br/>\nand her child that she doesn&#39;t home ed. (my opinion). But other than those<br/>\ntwo times everyone has been positive and interested in what we do. Various<br/>\npeople have asked if I&#39;ll &#39;take on&#39; their children as well... I always so<br/>\n&#39;No thank you&#39; as nicely as possible (and take it as a compliment!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bit below is the section from earlier - my comments re. flak jackets etc<br/>\nare my sense of humour and I aplogise to anyone who doesn&#39;t see it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, am I going to get shot to pieces but here goes...<br/>\nHave you ever stopped to think that, for some people, for a myriad of<br/>\nreasons, it is actually better that they go to school than stay at home? For<br/>\nsome adults, having children at home all day and everyday, takes more<br/>\npatience and love and understanding than they have to give. I know of two<br/>\nmothers who, whilst they love their kids and would defend them to the hilt,<br/>\nwould be in the looney bin by the end of the week and their kids in care if<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t in school. And what about the people who have to go out to<br/>\nwork? Public schools aren&#39;t all great, some have some very good bits, some<br/>\nhave some very bad bits: a lot just muddle along okay - a bit like the rest<br/>\nof us.<br/>\nSlipping quickly into her flak jacket, she signs off and ducks, Carolyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CelticFrau@...\">CelticFrau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 10, 2003 4:24 AM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] literacy rate??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Help!!
