(not said in an angry way)  I&#39;m not sure how you get angry <br/>\ntone when I actually wrote the words &quot;sarcastic tone&quot;.  Maybe being sarcastic <br/>\nis a British thing that some Americans really don&#39;t understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are comfortable living with someone who you give control to over you <br/>\nlife then there&#39;s really no need to be defensive is there?  I absolutely <br/>\nbelieve there is a power greater than myself and my belief in God or whatever <br/>\nI chose to call that &quot;thing&quot; has nothing to do with the relationship between <br/>\na husband and a wife. IMHO<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in this country (being the USA) it&#39;s called Freedom of Speech and <br/>\nit&#39;s part of the Constitution and I was exercising my right. Of course this <br/>\nis the Internet governed by other rules and so they may not apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to apologize for my belief system, as I&#39;m sure you would not <br/>\napologize for your religious beliefs.  I know what annoys me about father&#39;s <br/>\nwho want control and it&#39;s up to others to take a look at themselves if it <br/>\nbothers them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I get this in digest form now and I see from the digest I&#39;ve received <br/>\nthere are lots of &quot;Father&#39;s who want control&quot; answers so I&#39;ll go and see if <br/>\nsomeone else has taken offense and is defensive about what I say.  In <br/>\npsychology being defensive is all about something going on inside of a person <br/>\nthat strikes a nerve and it brings up things to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11739,"nextTopicId":11733}}
