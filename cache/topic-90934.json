It really got <br/>\nto me, because what they were saying was borne out by the classes on thinking <br/>\nand learning and communications I was taking, and by the stories of how <br/>\ncultures are passed on I was hearing in the anthropology department, and the things <br/>\nI knew that were making my English classes easier were things I had learned on <br/>\nmy own for fun.
