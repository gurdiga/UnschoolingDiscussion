One of the distinctions you might not be seeing <br/>\nis the difference between rural/urban living.  My guess is that it&#39;s more of <br/>\nthe rural unschoolers that are finding a use for guns in their lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a rural area (even though in many ways I&#39;m a city girl), and <br/>\nguns and their counterpart, bows, were very much a part of life.  They were a <br/>\npractical way to put meat on the table.  Hunting and target shooting provided <br/>\nbonding for people, men especially.  My boyfriend at the time hunted and fished <br/>\nnearly all seasons, often with his four adult brothers.  It gave a great excuse <br/>\nto get up early and enjoy the sunrise in the woods.  And hunting and target <br/>\nshooting were good practice for the boys who hoped to serve in the armed forces <br/>\nor the police force.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSafety and respect were very important, and there was definitely a code of <br/>\nhonor -- city hunters were those who would take a wild shot at a deer that was <br/>\ntoo far away or was already on the move, while good hunters were those who <br/>\nworked year-round on their accuracy (and range, if they were bow hunters) and <br/>\nknew, before they shot, exactly where their shot would go and how likely it would <br/>\nbe to bring the deer (or fox, or raccoon, etc.) down.  Good hunters knew they <br/>\nhad to track a bleeding animal and make sure the kill was finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is totally different from the setting for guns that gets more air play, <br/>\nthe urban setting.  A gun that is bought &quot;for protection&quot; is bought out of <br/>\nfear, not with a purpose in mind, not with the intent of practicing and <br/>\nincreasing skill level, not with a real understanding of the safety issues involved -- <br/>\nthat kind of gun purchase is, in my mind, irresponsible.  According to <br/>\n_Bowling for Columbine_, the guns that suburban dwellers buy &quot;for protection&quot; often <br/>\nget sold cheaply (buy teen family members) to gang members, and that&#39;s where <br/>\nsome of the inner city trouble comes from.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85797,"nextTopicId":85877}}
