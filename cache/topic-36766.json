I<br/>\nremember reading a book called &quot;The Runaway Pancake&quot; to my kindergarten<br/>\nclass. (very similar to &quot;The Gingerbread Man.&quot;) I don&#39;t remember my parents<br/>\nreading to me when I was very young either. As I recall, I don&#39;t remember<br/>\nthem reading to us much at all until I was about 10 or 11. I don&#39;t know how<br/>\nI picked it up, but I did. BTW my parents were FORCED to send me to<br/>\nheadstart when I was 4 because we were &quot;underpriviledged&quot;, translate that to<br/>\nmean poor. My mom tried to fight it, I am not sure why maybe stigma of being<br/>\npoor, but she told me that apparently the government thought that being poor<br/>\nalso meant a non-enriched environment or stupid. I could read before I went<br/>\nto headstart! We had World Book Encyclopedias and Child Craft. I can<br/>\nremember even when I was very young taking not just the Child Craft out and<br/>\nreading it on my own, but also the encyclopedia, for long periods of time. I<br/>\nreally enjoyed them, and I used them so much that my parents eventually just<br/>\nmoved the entire set into my room, so of course I bought a set for my<br/>\nfamily. I have been disapointed that my own kids have not used them as much<br/>\nas I did. They are starting to use them more though, now that I have been<br/>\ntrying to get out of the habit of telling them to go look something up when<br/>\nthey ask me a question, but instead now when they ask me something I say<br/>\nsomething like &quot;well, lets look it up and find out&quot;, or &quot;I&#39;ll go look it up<br/>\nand let you know&quot; and then I go look it up and usually they come with me and<br/>\nread along. Since I have changed my way of saying it, they now look up more<br/>\non their own, or ask me to look up something with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember Scout from To Kill A Mockingbird? She got in trouble when she<br/>\nstarted school because she already knew how to read! If I remember right,<br/>\nshe learned from her father reading the newspaper with her. Hey, maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s how I learned how to read! My dad and I shared a love for newspaper<br/>\ncomics, maybe he read them outloud to me and I just don&#39;t remember. He<br/>\npassed away when I was 19, so I can&#39;t ask him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzanna, who still loves to read and look things up; and still loves<br/>\nnewspaper comics.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36768,"nextTopicId":36767}}
