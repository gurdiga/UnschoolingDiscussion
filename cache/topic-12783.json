I have no sympathy for you as we live in Tucson, AZ<br/>\n&gt; where that &quot;dry heat&quot; they keep talking about is at 100 degrees today<br/>\n&gt; and we&#39;ve had this weather since the end of April this year.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; one of the reasons we are moving to Colorado next year as I cannot<br/>\n&gt; stand another summer indoors.  The swimming pool gets a bit old and I<br/>\n&gt; will get even older looking if I stay out in the sun too much longer<br/>\n&gt; (LOL)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dawn F </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12702,"nextTopicId":12755}}
