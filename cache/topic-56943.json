Anyway, a <br/>\nshop teacher has real life uses for arithematic every working day - <br/>\nmeasurements, tolerances, dimensions - if it came faster just from use he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have needed the students help. It probably is far from the first <br/>\ntime he&#39;s needed to figure out credit hours, either.<br/>\n<br/>\n**It seems he freezes up only under pressure, school kinda stuff.

I ended up doing it with him and it turned out<br/>\n<br/>\nok, it even seemed like he enjoyed it then.**<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son was in school for 6 years. He&#39;s the reason none of his younger <br/>\nsiblings went to school. (Well, my 18yo is taking community college classes <br/>\nnow, but they don&#39;t count as school. Another topic. &lt;g&gt;) Anyway... when I <br/>\ntook him out of school it was so I could stop fighting with him over math. I <br/>\nrecognize your scenario there. Did you scar him for life? Maybe.  The <br/>\nquestion  is, now what? You point out what he can do. You point out later <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s done okay on some arithematic thing without getting frustrated. You <br/>\nhelp him figure out how to avoid letting the &quot;math phobic screaming paranoid&quot; <br/>\nloose in his head. :=) You do more of those puzzles with him and don&#39;t ever <br/>\nhand him one to do alone again for awhile. I&#39;ll think of more, eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n**It&#39;s a fearful time. MOST teens get scared about how they&#39;re going to <br/>\nmanage on their own. It&#39;s not specific to unschooled kids. Not all parents <br/>\nget to hear about them, though. It depends how much the kids trust them.**<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**When I was his age that was the farthest thing from my mind. Then again <br/>\nthere wasn&#39;t to much in my mind and I didn&#39;t talk to my parents. I&#39;m glad my <br/>\nkids like me, and love that they talk to me.**<br/>\n<br/>\n:) Yeah. It&#39;s interesting, I get to hear not only my own kid&#39;s fears, but <br/>\nthose of a lot of the teens she interacts with. She processes a lot of <br/>\nconversations for herself by going over them with me later. Most of her local <br/>\nfriends and aquaintances are always-schooled. Lately I hear a lot about <br/>\ncollege. Kids who can&#39;t imagine not going to college because they don&#39;t know <br/>\nwho they are outside of their student role. Kids who have to go to college or <br/>\nmove out and be on their own, no support of any kind for any other path. Kids <br/>\nwho are searching for colleges as far from home as they can get. It&#39;s sad <br/>\nthat I&#39;m not hearing about a single one who&#39;s excited about going to college <br/>\nfor what they can learn there. Another interesting thing - she&#39;s getting a <br/>\nhard time from some of those same kids because her plans don&#39;t include <br/>\ncollege right now - not in the four years get a degree way, she&#39;s taking <br/>\nclasses that interest her, but all of them see that as &quot;different&quot; than going <br/>\nto college. If she was at the CC with a career plan that would be &quot;going to <br/>\ncollege&quot;. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the fears, I was thinking of that not only because of conversations <br/>\nwith my daughter, but because I just finished a book &quot;The Myth of Maturity&quot; <br/>\nthat talks about the fears and needs of kids at the leaving home ages. I <br/>\nrecommend it to anyone thinking their kids would be more confident and secure <br/>\nif they&#39;d gone to school. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] freaked out / was: Week four/ Needing support","postDate":"1043969359","msgId":57270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Yy4xYTlkODYxOC4yYjZiMGY0ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57250,"nextInTopic":57329,"prevInTime":57269,"nextInTime":57271,"topicId":56943,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/29/03 4:15:55 PM, ecsamhill@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-301740761\">In a message dated 1/29/03 4:15:55 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I think it isn&#39;t even intended to prove that one is &quot;smart&quot;, just that<br/>\none is docile and house-broken.

I needed to keep a portfolio with samples of<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; work to show the SD each year. Every subject but math and<br/>\nwriting were easy to deal with. We made a game of it, it was like a <br/>\nyearlong scavenger hunt to find fluffy educational looking stuff to stick<br/>\nin it. I took zillions of pictures of all the cool stuff we did and<br/>\npicked up pamphlets at all the places we visited. Math and writing were<br/>\nthe evil subjects though. I swear I tried to make it fun but besides<br/>\npictures of the kids doing stuff like measuring, building, and shopping,<br/>\nI needed paper work. I figured out how to minimalize the &quot;have to&quot; work<br/>\nbut the damage was still done. They didn&#39;t like to do it but they did it<br/>\nanyway. I told them it had to be done for the damn book.

But when he had <br/>\na passionate interest and reason to learn the math, he got it very <br/>\nquickly. When we lived in Seattle, he started his own business <br/>\ncleaning airplanes, and quickly took it to an extremely successful <br/>\nenterprise with several employees. By the time we left, 3 years <br/>\nlater, he was turning customers down, he had too many.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I&#39;m quite good at math, and went up through Calculus with ease. <br/>\nHowever, I didn&#39;t retain much of it because I don&#39;t use it on a daily <br/>\nbasis. If I had to work a differential equation now, I&#39;d have to get <br/>\ndown a book just to remember what the heck it really is. I can still <br/>\nmultiply and divide in my head easily, but that always came easily to <br/>\nme. For some folks it will, some folks it will come with lots of <br/>\npractice, and some folks, even successful businessmen like my DH, <br/>\nwill pull out a calculator! :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt, in one of his books - maybe How Kids Learn, or Learning <br/>\nAll The Time - had some fun ideas for how to improve math skills. If <br/>\nyour son is interested in improving, he might try some of those. My <br/>\nson really likes math and is always begging me to buy him workbooks. <br/>\nThey sell them at places like Rite-Aid and have them in various grade <br/>\nlevels, that might be another option if he just wants to practice <br/>\nbasic skills, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve heard of CD-Roms like MathBlasters <br/>\nand such that could be fun if a kid wanted to mess around with them. <br/>\nThere&#39;s lots of ways to improve math skills, if that&#39;s your son&#39;s <br/>\ngoal. If not, there is no limit to what age he could be when he does <br/>\ndecide that he needs the skills. If my DH can learn to multiply <br/>\nfractions at 32, then learning obviously doesn&#39;t stop at 11!<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hate the mainstream thinking that says there&#39;s a certain age <br/>\none must learn things by and after that, all is useless. I just <br/>\nlearned last year to write fiction, and wrote a novel. Before age 35, <br/>\nI had no idea I would even *want* to do such a thing, let alone be <br/>\ncapable of it. What age was Grandma Moses when she started painting, <br/>\nanyway? I did once see a website about &quot;late bloomers&quot; that listed <br/>\nvarious famous people and the ages that they&#39;d started practicing <br/>\ntheir trade, and it was really interesting. Definitely pointed out <br/>\nthat any age can be right to grab a passion and go with it.

Back when I first started <br/>\nposting here, I boldly asserted that the Founding Fathers all had <br/>\nstrict, scheduled courses of learning to follow, as directed by their <br/>\nparents or tutors. WRONG! B. Franklin was totally self-educated, <br/>\nexcept his momma taught him to read, and one year of grammar school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, back to that diploma thing. His father, seeing how quickly and <br/>\nearly he learned to read, thought he might make a good scholar, and <br/>\nso enrolled him in grammar school at age eight. He made head of class <br/>\nin one year, but because of money concerns, AND BECAUSE [quote] &quot;the <br/>\nmean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain&quot; [/quote] <br/>\nhis father withdrew Benjamin from the school. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, back in colonial days, a course of higher education often meant <br/>\nno great improvement in the capacity to earn a living? Really? Sort <br/>\nof like my hubby&#39;s comments &quot;Look at how many people with college <br/>\ndegrees are flipping burgers at McDonald&#39;s&quot; L <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll tell you what Mr. Franklin attributes his huge success to, <br/>\nthough: Hard Work. His fortune was made in the printing trade, and <br/>\nmany customers were recommended to him in his first year of business, <br/>\nbecause he had a reputation of being a worker. He gained a reputation <br/>\nas a man good with words, because at age 12, he set out on a course <br/>\nto improve his style. Not becuase a teacher told hiim to, but because <br/>\nhe wanted to improve his writing style. And then he diligently <br/>\npursued that goal, working hard to refine his writing. He also worked <br/>\nhard his whole life at improving his moral behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe never was any good at math.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m learning lots from Ben.

His businesses failed because he&#39;s a poor <br/>\nbusinessman! I&#39;m guessing he can&#39;t get a job because of some other factor. <br/>\nThat&#39;s ridiculous!   Your son is taking THIS man at his word???<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son freaked because now he&#39;ll &quot;end up on welfare&quot; since I didn&#39;t force<br/>\n&gt; him to go to school where &quot;they would have forced him to learn math&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; he &quot;could be going to school now and getting a diploma if he had the<br/>\n&gt; confidence that he could keep up with the high school level classes&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he ends up on welfare, that&#39;s HIS fault, not yours. Just as if I end up on <br/>\nwelfare, it&#39;s MY fault, not my parents&#39;. Besides, I could always move back in <br/>\nwith them if it ever approached any where near that point. I&#39;m guessing the <br/>\nsame with him. &quot;On welfare&quot;---bad example!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He also told me he believes that if you don&#39;t learn stuff by the time<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re 11 you&#39;ll never get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK, tell him I said that was about the STUPIDEST thing I&#39;ve EVER heard. <br/>\nREALLY! Tell him to go back and THINK about THAT one again!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After talking a while to find out what brought on this math attack he<br/>\n&gt; told me he was upset because his shop teacher was trying to figure out<br/>\n&gt; how they were going to complete 140 credit hours in 44 days at 2 1/2<br/>\n&gt; hours a day. Another student did the math instantly while my son had to<br/>\n&gt; think about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OK. I didn&#39;t even bother to THINK about it as I read it. Now I&#39;ll think <br/>\n(Joyce probably figured it out before the end of the sentence!!!&lt;G&gt;): 44 <br/>\ndays. Two hours a day---88 hours. add another 1/2 hour/day 22 hours. <br/>\nUMMMM---110 hours. Nope it won&#39;t work. They&#39;ll have to put in more time, <br/>\nmaybe a coupla&#39; extra Saturdays. <br/>\n<br/>\nI bet I spent JUST as many hours in math class as Joyce. It&#39;s her LOVE. It&#39;s <br/>\nmy struggle. Is it possible for me to do math? Sometimes. (Hell, that example <br/>\nmay be totally wrong---but that&#39;s why I ask Joyce! &lt;BWGGG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fault! He doesn&#39;t want to have to think about it. He<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wants to be able to do the math instantly. I told him that the other guy<br/>\n&gt; probably does math every day, and if he had to do it every day he be<br/>\n&gt; quicker too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe. Maybe NOT. Some of us have to think harder on it because it&#39;s not <br/>\n*there*. My husband&#39;s a math-wiz. Handy for me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  If he wants to start a business maybe he could<br/>\n&gt; hire a bookkeeper. I gave him the example of the last part time job I<br/>\n&gt; had. I managed the office at a gymnastics school because the guy who<br/>\n&gt; owned it enjoyed coaching but hated the office part of the business.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Bookkeepers are great. If you can&#39;t afford one, marry one! &lt;G&gt; (Although <br/>\nsometimes THAT kind can be more costly! &lt;G&gt; Many ways around a problem. Step <br/>\nOUT of the box!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Today I told my son if he wants a diploma I&#39;d print him one up on the<br/>\n&gt; computer. He liked that.<br/>\n&gt; I &#39;m still worried about him and his fears, it&#39;s not good to be thinking<br/>\n&gt; like this at his age.<br/>\n&gt; Somebody tell me something good. Is there a list of not so famous<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers that aren&#39;t on welfare? The famous list doesn&#39;t do it for<br/>\n&gt; him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a high schol diploma--- lotta&#39; good it&#39;s done me. It&#39;s in a scrapbook. <br/>\nBeen there since I received it! I did go to college. LOTS of them: Cornell. <br/>\nVirginia Tech. Wofford College. U of South Carolina. U of Vienna, Austria <br/>\nthrough Central College of Pella, Iowa. Nope. No degree. But I learned A LOT. <br/>\nBut NOT in class!! <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve started a tack shop, a provincial French restaurant, three dogs grooming <br/>\nbusinesses (one in Germany, one mobile). I&#39;ve put on one successful <br/>\nunschooling conference and am working on my second. I&#39;m designing our next <br/>\nhouse and barn (round). I&#39;ll be in charge of the new farm and its breeding <br/>\noperation as well as its upkeep. I&#39;m an unschooling mom (how many of you <br/>\nHAVEN&#39;T heard, &quot;Oh, I could NEVER do THAT!&quot;?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has NOTHING to do with a piece of paper or a math class. It has EVERYTHING <br/>\nto do with WANTING to do something. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell him to call me. 803 776 4849. His nickel, but I&#39;ll be happy to tell him <br/>\noptions.
