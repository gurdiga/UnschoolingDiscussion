The list of suspect crops changes over time, but strawberries always top it. They are often full of methyl bromide, a fungicide and known carcinogen, that consumer pressure has so far been unsuccessful in eliminating, and I do not eat them if I cannot find organizally grown ones.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStrawberries and white grapes used to be one of the ways I got through summer (I hate heat and humidity). Sigh. I have a crop in the garden, but it only produces once. Eating organic strawberries is tantamount to eating money, so we usually go without.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone ever heard of ground cherries? They&#39;re sweet and wonderful, a relative of tomatillos. My grandfather used to have them in his garden and I try to, but they are getting harder and harder to find.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8732,"nextTopicId":8767}}
