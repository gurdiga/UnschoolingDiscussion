It is in our<br/>\nthird bedroom. We live in a 3 bedroom townhouse so<br/>\nthat was the easiest place for us to put it. I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave pictures as this time so I will describe it to<br/>\nthe best of my ability. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the South wall we have a window just to the right<br/>\nof the middle of the wall. On the left we have the<br/>\nMath area. I bought punch out 2&quot; letters at a teachers<br/>\nsupply store to label each subject area. The math area<br/>\nwe use 2&quot; letters that are orange. I have a number<br/>\nchart that goes up to 100 that I laminated on the wall<br/>\nunder the word math. I used thumbtacks to put in on<br/>\nthe wall. To the left of the chart I found a poster<br/>\nagain at a teachers supply store that I laminated of<br/>\ndifferent shapes - square, circle, octagon, etc. I<br/>\nthen cut out each shape and thumbtacked each one up.<br/>\nUnder these I have a shelf thing I bought at Bed Bath<br/>\n& Beyond for $9.99. It is supposed to be used in a<br/>\ncloset for shoes. Here is a link that I found though<br/>\nit is a lot more in cost.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(\">http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(</a>1vcb5c45m1anno55giivng34)/LargeImage.aspx?<br/>\nSKU=52692<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(\">http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(</a>1vcb5c45m1anno55giivng34)/LargeImage.aspx<br/>\n?SKU=52692&Image=52692h.jpg&ProdDescription=LARGE%20SHOE%20STACKER%20SHELF%2<br/>\n0HORZNTL%20STACK%2012%22&gt;<br/>\n&Image=52692h.jpg&ProdDescription=LARGE%20SHOE%20STACKER%20SHELF%20HORZNTL%2<br/>\n0STACK%2012%22<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought two of these for the math area and just<br/>\nstacked them on top of each other. The middle shelf<br/>\nthing you see I didn&#39;t put it there on the 2nd one<br/>\nthat sits on the bottom. I screwed it in to make on<br/>\nbig rectangle piece. The shelf can either be put where<br/>\nyou see it in the picture or at the bottom area- at<br/>\nleast the ones I bought you can. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the right of the math area under the window I have<br/>\na plastic 3 drawer thing that rolls (though we don&#39;t<br/>\nroll it out) that I put paint with water books in (top<br/>\ndrawer) coloring books (2nd drawer) and plain paper<br/>\n(3rd drawer - is just plain printer paper I buy at<br/>\nWalmart for $12 a box which is 3000 sheets of paper).<br/>\nThen to the right of this is 2 black filing cabinets<br/>\nwhich I put our work to be done in for each week and<br/>\nother stuff needed to be filed. Then to the right of<br/>\nthis I have an old sewing table (where the sewing<br/>\nmachine would flip up from inside though it&#39;s no<br/>\nlonger there) to put my dvd, vcr and small 13&quot; tv on<br/>\nso we can watch any educational movies with. I use the<br/>\nlibrary all of the time. We just finished studying the<br/>\nletter E and I also borrowed movies about Elephants<br/>\nboth non fiction and fiction. I could use the elephant<br/>\nmovies for science though I don&#39;t. Under this table is<br/>\nwhere I keep a plastic bin that holds our books that<br/>\nwill be used for homeschool and our vcr and dvds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the West Wall. Right next to the tv area<br/>\nis a closet door where I store most of our homeschool<br/>\ncraft supplies, extra educational items, easel papers,<br/>\nrecycleable items to make crafts with, homeschool<br/>\nbooks that were bought in advance for next year, etc. <br/>\nTo the right of this is our Social Studies area. I<br/>\nused 2&quot; red punch out letters for this area. I Have a<br/>\nbulletin board underneath the word Social Studies.<br/>\nThen underneath this I have another shelf thing like<br/>\nin the Math area. To the right of the shelf on the<br/>\nfloor I have a globe 9nothing to sit it on yet) The<br/>\nrest of the wall is left plain to hang up any maps,<br/>\netc for what we are learning at that time. To the<br/>\nright of this a bit is our door to enter the room. We<br/>\nkeep the door open at all times where I have our blank<br/>\ncalendar up on it. I again bought a calendar at a<br/>\nteachers supply store that just has the days across it<br/>\nand laminated it. I then bought another poster that I<br/>\nlaminated that had the months on it and cut them out<br/>\nto use for each month that I  put above the calendar.<br/>\nI also bought calendar dates (this month has a snowman<br/>\non each date- last month had turkeys) and laminated<br/>\nthem. I then use rubber glue to have my daughter<br/>\n&quot;attatch&quot; them onto the calendar. I love this method<br/>\nas the rubber glue comes off so easily. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight outside the door I have a 4 drawer dresser where<br/>\nwe put extra supplies in. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the North wall we have the Language Arts/Reading<br/>\narea where I used blue 2&quot; punch out letters for. I<br/>\nhave two bulletin boards here - one next to each other<br/>\n- pretty large ones that were bought at Walmart for<br/>\n$7.?? each. Maybe around $8. I have a laminated poster<br/>\nof each letter above the bulletin boards. Underneath<br/>\nthe left bulletin board I again have a shelf thing as<br/>\nin the math area. To the right of the shelf a bit I<br/>\nhave a 3 drawer very small thing that we hold our<br/>\nextra craft projects my daughter is working on by<br/>\nherself. Then to the right I have a Little Tikes blue<br/>\neasel for painting. Underneath it is a vinyl<br/>\ntablecloth folded up to cover the floor from paint.<br/>\nThe tablecloth was bought at Walmart for around $2.38.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the East wall has our Science area which is done<br/>\nin 2&quot; green letters. A bulletin board is underneath<br/>\nwith again a shelf thing under that. I have a poster<br/>\nthat I laminated and cut up with a picture of each<br/>\ncolor with its name to the left of the bulletin board.<br/>\nI have room around the bulletin board on each side to<br/>\nhang posters, etc for what we are working on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the middle of the room is our table. It is a U<br/>\nshaped wood table that I received for free that we<br/>\nuse. We bought our chairs (2) from a big teachers<br/>\nsupply store. They were expensive at around $22 each<br/>\nbut I wanted them to have a nice chair to sit on. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur walls are an off white color and we just have<br/>\ncarpet on the floor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you somewhat. Sorry this is so<br/>\nlengthy but I also looked for ideas on the internet<br/>\nbut it was basically no help. I will say the one thing<br/>\nthat has been a huge huge help to us was to have each<br/>\nsubject sectioned off from each other. I did find one<br/>\nhomeschool room where the mom had put social studies<br/>\nand bible study mixed in together and to me it made it<br/>\nso confusing. If I was to do bible study also I would<br/>\nput it in it&#39;s own section. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and if you have any questions please feel<br/>\nfree to email me! <br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly P. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- &quot;Kim J.

We kept the books in it.  All the craft stuff and lego  stuff and a <br/>\ncomputer or two were in there, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn this house we have a studio and a music room.  We&#39;ve always had an  <br/>\n&quot;office&quot; in all our homes, but that doesn&#39;t apply so much since we have mostly  <br/>\nlaptops now.  In this house the room that was the &quot;office&#39; is now the music  room <br/>\nwhere we keep our guitars and ukes and electronic piano.  The network  hub is <br/>\nin there, too, and this room is about to be renovated and will be much  <br/>\nchanged from it&#39;s current configuration, although it will have musical stuff in  it.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 21 yo and his girlfriend are living in the studio temporarily.  We  just <br/>\ngot through renovating it, and part of it will still be a craft  room/flexible <br/>\nspace, and the other part will have the exercise equipment and  hang-out space <br/>\nonce my son moves out.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I really want o do is consolidate all the  <br/>\nelectronics/office/running-of-the-house stuff into one tiny little corner.   The network hub, the telephone <br/>\nbase, the files and bills, the fax machine, the  printer...all that in one <br/>\nlittle corner.  We should be able to print on the  network and use the fax as <br/>\nneeded that way.  Then the craft room will be  flexible space for doing whatever <br/>\nproject needs to be done in heated space, and  it will be the place where <br/>\nthings can be stored and left unfinished.  While  the rest of the studio would <br/>\nhave TV and couches and etc.  The music room  will have the instruments, plus a <br/>\nconfiguration for playing them,  and places to read.  That room is off the <br/>\nliving room via a wide  double door, so those rooms would be used simultaneously <br/>\nor separately.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo that&#39;s a lot of detail to say that we do things all over the house and  we <br/>\ndon&#39;t need a &quot;school&quot; room because we don&#39;t do &quot;school&quot;.  But we do need  <br/>\nlots of other rooms for purposes of living and eating and learning, and that&#39;s  <br/>\nhow I intend to use my space.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI loved the library in the middle of the old house.  We could trash it  and <br/>\nthen shut the doors and then all the rest of the house could be kept pick  up.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Homeschool rooms","postDate":"1135797615","msgId":110877,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzQjJFNTZGLjcwNDA3MDhAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjI4MTUxODA4LjdGQzZCNEQyNEB0eWxlci5jcy50YW11LmVkdT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjI4MTUxODA4LjdGQzZCNEQyNEB0eWxlci5jcy50YW11LmVkdT4="},"prevInTopic":110876,"nextInTopic":110878,"prevInTime":110876,"nextInTime":110878,"topicId":110871,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We live in a 3 bedroom townhouse so<br/>\nthat was the easiest place for us to put it. I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave pictures as this time so I will describe it to<br/>\nthe best of my ability. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the South wall we have a window just to the right<br/>\nof the middle of the wall. On the left we have the<br/>\nMath area. I bought punch out 2&quot; letters at a teachers<br/>\nsupply store to label each subject area. The math area<br/>\nwe use 2&quot; letters that are orange. I have a number<br/>\nchart that goes up to 100 that I laminated on the wall<br/>\nunder the word math. I used thumbtacks to put in on<br/>\nthe wall. To the left of the chart I found a poster<br/>\nagain at a teachers supply store that I laminated of<br/>\ndifferent shapes - square, circle, octagon, etc. I<br/>\nthen cut out each shape and thumbtacked each one up.<br/>\nUnder these I have a shelf thing I bought at Bed Bath<br/>\n& Beyond for $9.99. It is supposed to be used in a<br/>\ncloset for shoes. Here is a link that I found though<br/>\nit is a lot more in cost.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(\">http://www.acehardwareoutlet.com/(</a>1vcb5c45m1anno55giivng34)/LargeImage.aspx?SKU=52692&Image=52692h.jpg&ProdDescription=LARGE%20SHOE%20STACKER%20SHELF%20HORZNTL%20STACK%2012%22<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought two of these for the math area and just<br/>\nstacked them on top of each other. The middle shelf<br/>\nthing you see I didn&#39;t put it there on the 2nd one<br/>\nthat sits on the bottom. I screwed it in to make on<br/>\nbig rectangle piece. The shelf can either be put where<br/>\nyou see it in the picture or at the bottom area- at<br/>\nleast the ones I bought you can. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo the right of the math area under the window I have<br/>\na plastic 3 drawer thing that rolls (though we don&#39;t<br/>\nroll it out) that I put paint with water books in (top<br/>\ndrawer) coloring books (2nd drawer) and plain paper<br/>\n(3rd drawer - is just plain printer paper I buy at<br/>\nWalmart for $12 a box which is 3000 sheets of paper).<br/>\nThen to the right of this is 2 black filing cabinets<br/>\nwhich I put our work to be done in for each week and<br/>\nother stuff needed to be filed. Then to the right of<br/>\nthis I have an old sewing table (where the sewing<br/>\nmachine would flip up from inside though it&#39;s no<br/>\nlonger there) to put my dvd, vcr and small 13&quot; tv on<br/>\nso we can watch any educational movies with. I use the<br/>\nlibrary all of the time. We just finished studying the<br/>\nletter E and I also borrowed movies about Elephants<br/>\nboth non fiction and fiction. I could use the elephant<br/>\nmovies for science though I don&#39;t. Under this table is<br/>\nwhere I keep a plastic bin that holds our books that<br/>\nwill be used for homeschool and our vcr and dvds.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the West Wall. Right next to the tv area<br/>\nis a closet door where I store most of our homeschool<br/>\ncraft supplies, extra educational items, easel papers,<br/>\nrecycleable items to make crafts with, homeschool<br/>\nbooks that were bought in advance for next year, etc. <br/>\nTo the right of this is our Social Studies area. I<br/>\nused 2&quot; red punch out letters for this area. I Have a<br/>\nbulletin board underneath the word Social Studies.<br/>\nThen underneath this I have another shelf thing like<br/>\nin the Math area. To the right of the shelf on the<br/>\nfloor I have a globe 9nothing to sit it on yet) The<br/>\nrest of the wall is left plain to hang up any maps,<br/>\netc for what we are learning at that time. To the<br/>\nright of this a bit is our door to enter the room. We<br/>\nkeep the door open at all times where I have our blank<br/>\ncalendar up on it. I again bought a calendar at a<br/>\nteachers supply store that just has the days across it<br/>\nand laminated it. I then bought another poster that I<br/>\nlaminated that had the months on it and cut them out<br/>\nto use for each month that I  put above the calendar.<br/>\nI also bought calendar dates (this month has a snowman<br/>\non each date- last month had turkeys) and laminated<br/>\nthem. I then use rubber glue to have my daughter<br/>\n&quot;attatch&quot; them onto the calendar. I love this method<br/>\nas the rubber glue comes off so easily. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight outside the door I have a 4 drawer dresser where<br/>\nwe put extra supplies in. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the North wall we have the Language Arts/Reading<br/>\narea where I used blue 2&quot; punch out letters for. I<br/>\nhave two bulletin boards here - one next to each other<br/>\n- pretty large ones that were bought at Walmart for<br/>\n$7.?? each. Maybe around $8. I have a laminated poster<br/>\nof each letter above the bulletin boards. Underneath<br/>\nthe left bulletin board I again have a shelf thing as<br/>\nin the math area. To the right of the shelf a bit I<br/>\nhave a 3 drawer very small thing that we hold our<br/>\nextra craft projects my daughter is working on by<br/>\nherself. Then to the right I have a Little Tikes blue<br/>\neasel for painting. Underneath it is a vinyl<br/>\ntablecloth folded up to cover the floor from paint.<br/>\nThe tablecloth was bought at Walmart for around $2.38.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the East wall has our Science area which is done<br/>\nin 2&quot; green letters. A bulletin board is underneath<br/>\nwith again a shelf thing under that. I have a poster<br/>\nthat I laminated and cut up with a picture of each<br/>\ncolor with its name to the left of the bulletin board.<br/>\nI have room around the bulletin board on each side to<br/>\nhang posters, etc for what we are working on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the middle of the room is our table. It is a U<br/>\nshaped wood table that I received for free that we<br/>\nuse. We bought our chairs (2) from a big teachers<br/>\nsupply store. They were expensive at around $22 each<br/>\nbut I wanted them to have a nice chair to sit on. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur walls are an off white color and we just have<br/>\ncarpet on the floor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you somewhat. Sorry this is so<br/>\nlengthy but I also looked for ideas on the internet<br/>\nbut it was basically no help. I will say the one thing<br/>\nthat has been a huge huge help to us was to have each<br/>\nsubject sectioned off from each other.

Then we have a livingroom filled with bookshelves, a tv, and room to do projects.   When we originally started homeschooling we were a &quot;school at home&quot; family (yuck, I know )  &  the garage was going to be used as the &quot;school room&quot; but that plan changed.<br/>\nWe just decorated it as we would the rest of the house.
