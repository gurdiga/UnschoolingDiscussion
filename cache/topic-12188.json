Funny thing is, since we started homeschooling three years <br/>\nago, I find that I am much more willing to try new things.  That led to a <br/>\nwillingness to try new ways of relating to my children.  After all, <br/>\nhomeschooling and especially unschooling are huge new ways of relating, <br/>\nright?  But, I am also much more opinionated, so I tend to tell everybody <br/>\nwhat I think, including how to raise their children &lt;grin&gt; so please forgive <br/>\nme if I sound too stident.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jaam1224@cs.com","from":"Jaam1224@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"UWfinx7PFyNr6RHD75RCugMqImK7Tg8ko5JCAIYkTckUSQJaCpHViC3BllBmds_-B6uUf0EV","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Questions from a Newbie/Behavior","postDate":"967313150","msgId":12190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwLjE4YjdiODQuMjZkOTYwZmVAY3MuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12188,"nextInTopic":12218,"prevInTime":12189,"nextInTime":12191,"topicId":12188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Carron, I love your post, please pass on your thoughts .....

It is so hard dealing with <br/>\na new baby and your other child&#39;s behavioral issues at the same time!  <br/>\nEspecially when I bet a lot of those behaviors are a direct result of having <br/>\nthe new baby in the house.  I promise things will get better.  But it will <br/>\ntake time and consistency.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Now, I just have to work on REALLY <br/>\n&gt;  keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!

I really have to pay attention to my voice, <br/>\neven now.  There are still times when my son tries my patience -- that will <br/>\nnever go away, I&#39;m sure -- but it has gotten easier.   Even if a calm voice <br/>\nis not second nature, I&#39;ve tried to make it a habit to stop and think before <br/>\nI say anything (the old count to 10 trick).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Also, the Library thinks they <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  may have the book which they got from the interlibrary loan service -- a <br/>\n&gt;  local college apparently has or will have several copies of the Toddler <br/>\n </span></blockquote>book <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  you referred to -- I am really looking forward to reading it!<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome.  I really believe in Love and Logic, and I know that with <br/>\nconsistency, it works.  You guys are going through a really trying time, <br/>\nright now.
