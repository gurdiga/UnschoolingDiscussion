Well, for everyone.  But <br/>\nI had read about it a while back at unschooling.com, in something Anne <br/>\nOhman wrote, and asked Marty if he knew about it.   Then the busy week <br/>\ncarried me away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday a toy catalog came, and there it was:  Donkey Konga, for GameCube.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rushed upstairs, pointed at it, and asked Kirby if I gave him money would he <br/>\ngo and get me one.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  He did.  We played it.  I wanted a second set  of drums so we could do <br/>\nthe competitive mode.   He said the store had had a used set for $20.   Fifteen <br/>\nminutes later, we&#39;re playing two-player.  So $70 total for us, maybe you can <br/>\nfind it cheaper, but if you pay full price, $80 for two sets of (basically) bongos <br/>\nand the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s music reading, almost exactly, but not close enough that the music readers <br/>\n(Keith and I) are at  an advantage.  But close enough that someone who <br/>\nlearns to play these drums will have a headstart on reading traditional <br/>\nwestern musical notation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different marks for left, right, both and clap (and a little microphone <br/>\nbetween the drums knows you clapped).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it&#39;s not really a konga drum, I thought they should&#39;ve called it Bongo <br/>\nKazooie.  But it&#39;s too late for that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had tons of fun, and the boys&#39; cousins and two of their friends came by <br/>\nand ended up staying a long time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the points you earn playing one-player, you can buy options--different <br/>\ndrum sounds, &quot;mini games,&quot; harder versions of songs, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not set up to keep individual players&#39; scores, but saves the overall high <br/>\nscores of the game in general.  So in that way it&#39;s &quot;cooperative.&quot;  Points <br/>\nanyone makes are in the bank for anyone else to spend on upgrades and <br/>\nlevels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought (and said) it would be like Dance, Dance Revolution, only for fingers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell... it&#39;s not for fingers.  It&#39;s for arms, shoulders, and if you hold the bongos <br/>\nbetween your legs, for other parts.  The first long session Kirby played he <br/>\ncould hardly get up and walk afterwards, and was whining about his <br/>\nshoulders hurting. &lt;g&gt;  I sit close to the table and wedge my drums between <br/>\nme and the edge of the table.  Some hold them in laps (one dropped them <br/>\nwhile clapping.   Some leave them on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] reading music, was Re: Kinesthetic/Random-Abstract","postDate":"1099328913","msgId":100914,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1LjUxNDVmY2MxLjJlYjdjNzkxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":100913,"nextInTopic":100943,"prevInTime":100913,"nextInTime":100915,"topicId":100913,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/1/04 9:12:32 AM, nellebelle@charter.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1782002783\">In a message dated 11/1/04 9:12:32 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Then I picked up an electric guitar and bought a &quot;teach yourself&quot; book.  <br/>\nI was surprised that it starts out with notes played with one finger on one <br/>\nstring at a time.

(Now I wouldn&#39;t think of it as quitting, but that&#39;s how my parents thought of it then and I&#39;m sure it colored years of my thinking about playing an instrument.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last couple of years I&#39;ve been playing guitar, a little.  A friend showed me how to play 4 chords for &quot;Where have all the flowers gone?&quot;.  I&#39;ve been practicing that one song.  Then I picked up an electric guitar and bought a &quot;teach yourself&quot; book.  I was surprised that it starts out with notes played with one finger on one string at a time.  I&#39;d assumed guitars were only played in chords.  The book explains which finger goes on which string AND shows it on the staff.  It leads through boring songs with one and two notes, but builds on that as it goes.  I&#39;m now on the third string and can play several recognizable songs.  Jingle Bells and Aura Lee are two.  That may not be much, but playing real songs is much more rewarding than isolated notes, for me anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying from the sheet music was very hard at first.  I marked most of the pages with the name of the note underneath the note on the staff.  It is beginning to connect in my brain so I can look at the notes and know which fingers to put where!  If I go several days without playing, it&#39;s a bit harder at first.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa, 11, wants to learn to play too.  She looked at it with me but got quickly frustrated, saying, &quot;I can&#39;t read music!&quot;.  I agreed that she couldn&#39;t, but that she *could* learn how, just as she learned to read words.  I explained that I hadn&#39;t been able to read it at first either, but am figuring it out one note at a time.  She doesn&#39;t pick it up as often as I do, but she has learned the first couple of songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing about playing guitar is that you need to keep your fingernails very short, at least on the left hand.  I&#39;d never noticed before how very fast fingernails can grow!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- But I think when beginners to reading music see the music, they balk and <br/>\n  freeze up, thinking &quot;reading&quot; is coming to a point where they just see it and it <br/>\n  comes out of their hands or mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":100955,"nextTopicId":100959}}
