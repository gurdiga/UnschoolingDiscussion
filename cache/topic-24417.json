Happy Birthday, honey&quot; and everyone <br/>\n  said happy birthday to him, and he sort of smirk/grinned and kept <br/>\n  dishing his food and never said nothin...that is how clueless he can <br/>\n  be.

I&#39;m not going to force him to be Mr. <br/>\n  Social.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT!!! my hubby&#39;s ... social backwardness...has set him back as an <br/>\n  adult. I would say, in at least one case, he failed to get a job <br/>\n  based on this cluelessness at an interview. (I know about it, becaues <br/>\n  a good friend of mine works where he was interviewing, and told me <br/>\n  what the interviewer said about it, trying to help out) I&#39;ve wondered <br/>\n  if he makes a poor first impression, leaving him out of some things <br/>\n  that would make a more fulfilling, happier life for him. I&#39;d much <br/>\n  rather my kids don&#39;t follow in those footsteps QUITE exactly!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; One of my best friends on this planet is like that. People always <br/>\n  ask why she <br/>\n  &gt; is rude and never talks at gatherings. The funny thing is she&#39;s not <br/>\n  ever <br/>\n  &gt; actually rude. She simply doesn&#39;t speak much, only says hello when <br/>\n  someone else <br/>\n  &gt; says it first and sometimes she doesn&#39;t respond with anything but a <br/>\n  slight, make <br/>\n  &gt; that a very slight grin. It all comes down to shyness for her. Not <br/>\n  the hide <br/>\n  &gt; in a room kind of shy, just the &quot;I don&#39;t know them yet, so I stay <br/>\n  quiet until I <br/>\n  &gt; do.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s someone at our church like that, too. Once you get to know <br/>\n  her, she&#39;s a HOOT! but she takes some time to warm up, and is even <br/>\n  hesitant with friends, to be open. But she is generally polite, <br/>\n  answering when spoken to and the like. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  She is who she is. And in my book, as long as she isn&#39;t mean <br/>\n  &gt; or hateful, then why take offense? But the world has become so <br/>\n  victimized and <br/>\n  &gt; for some reason it&#39;s easier to stay in that state of mind then to <br/>\n  accept <br/>\n  &gt; responsibility for one&#39;s own feelings and actions. You can only be <br/>\n  offended if you <br/>\n  &gt; choose to take offense, just like only being manipulated, if you <br/>\n  choose to be <br/>\n  &gt; so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hear ya there! This happens sometimes w/my hubby and another <br/>\n  friend. She gets irritated about some of his JUST NATURAL aloofness. <br/>\n  And I&#39;ve had to remind her more than once &quot;This is just how he is. If <br/>\n  it doesn&#39;t tick ME off, why is it bugging YOU so much?&quot; I mean it <br/>\n  isn&#39;t like he&#39;s being rude on purpose. He is JUST CLUELESS, and I&#39;m <br/>\n  not going to harp on him about it. If he were going to get over this <br/>\n  tendency, it should have happened when he was a kid, not as a grown <br/>\n  man whose wife wants him to do differently.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; And then what if Rob was just a little grumpy that day. I mean he <br/>\n  is human <br/>\n  &gt; and don&#39;t we all have bad days? Those days where nothing really has <br/>\n  happened to <br/>\n  &gt; set you off, but you just feel kind of yuck. I think he should have <br/>\n  the <br/>\n  &gt; freedom to feel yucky just as well as happy. It seems like he at <br/>\n  least responding in <br/>\n  &gt; kind when you reminded him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah, he did well. With the haircut example, it was like this little <br/>\n  monologue. I could see it in his face: (Oh. I forgot that <br/>\n  acknowledging a compliment is proper) &quot;Thanks&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I think overall you handled it well, but I also think you are <br/>\n  putting too <br/>\n  &gt; much weight on it. And if it ends up being a part of his true <br/>\n  personailty, then <br/>\n  &gt; would it be right to try to change that about him? <br/>\n<br/>\n  No more than it would be right for me to try and change my hubby.<br/>\n<br/>\n  His comfort zone in social <br/>\n  &gt; situations may never mirror your own, but isn&#39;t it better for him <br/>\n  if you can <br/>\n  &gt; accept the difference than to try to alter it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  yeah. I&#39;m thinking, with some Faux Pas Practice and a proactive <br/>\n  reminder about the social situations and what manners are appropriate <br/>\n  as they come up, he may remain a quiet type but capable of dredging <br/>\n  up normal, polite responses when necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Just my thoughts,<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Rhonda<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; P.S.

You are <br/>\n  &gt; simply awesome and your kids are lucky to have a mom so eager to <br/>\n  change her <br/>\n  &gt; own parenting skills for their sakes, if she finds herself <br/>\n  questioning her <br/>\n  &gt; responses.<br/>\n<br/>\n  thanks, Rhonda.

Not that it makes a <br/>\nhuge difference though, I was just wondering. Some people are just not social. <br/>\nIt is not always about being rude with the intent to be rude. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my best friends on this planet is like that. People always ask why she <br/>\nis rude and never talks at gatherings. The funny thing is she&#39;s not ever <br/>\nactually rude. She simply doesn&#39;t speak much, only says hello when someone else <br/>\nsays it first and sometimes she doesn&#39;t respond with anything but a slight, make <br/>\nthat a very slight grin. It all comes down to shyness for her. Not the hide <br/>\nin a room kind of shy, just the &quot;I don&#39;t know them yet, so I stay quiet until I <br/>\ndo.&quot; However, this even occurs with people she has known for years. <br/>\nEspecially if I&#39;m not around (no pat on the back though she just tells me if I don&#39;t <br/>\nattend she won&#39;t have anyone to talk to). I&#39;ve had mutual friends call and say <br/>\nshe never spoke at whatever they attended, or that she didn&#39;t talk until I got <br/>\nthere. I&#39;m a yacker, so since I&#39;m always saying something and I include her in <br/>\nit, she has to respond. It also elivates her nervousness, at least that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat she says. She also is well aware that people find her so stand offish, but <br/>\nit&#39;s just a part of her personality and frankly I get irritated when people <br/>\nwant to debate it. She is who she is. And in my book, as long as she isn&#39;t mean <br/>\nor hateful, then why take offense? But the world has become so victimized and <br/>\nfor some reason it&#39;s easier to stay in that state of mind then to accept <br/>\nresponsibility for one&#39;s own feelings and actions. You can only be offended if you <br/>\nchoose to take offense, just like only being manipulated, if you choose to be <br/>\nso.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then what if Rob was just a little grumpy that day. I mean he is human <br/>\nand don&#39;t we all have bad days? Those days where nothing really has happened to <br/>\nset you off, but you just feel kind of yuck. I think he should have the <br/>\nfreedom to feel yucky just as well as happy. It seems like he at least responding in <br/>\nkind when you reminded him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think overall you handled it well, but I also think you are putting too <br/>\nmuch weight on it. And if it ends up being a part of his true personailty, then <br/>\nwould it be right to try to change that about him?

With only a half hour or less, and with things like a <br/>\nscooter and a pogo stick and bikes, there was plenty to do while my <br/>\nfriend and I said hello...etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobby (my 10yr old) tried out the pogo stick, and then came inside. <br/>\nMy girlfriend greeted him &quot;Hi Robby. Nice to see you.&quot; and Robby sort <br/>\nof shrugged and mumbled something. Didn&#39;t even glance in my friend&#39;s <br/>\ndirection, let alone make eye contact or smile at her. And then he <br/>\nwent back outside. It wasn&#39;t a busy-kid-dashing-in-and-dashing-out <br/>\nkind of thing, more like a big-deal-rolling-his-eyes kind of <br/>\nattitude. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got a chance alone with him, I said &quot;I think you could have <br/>\ndone better when L. said hello to you. Was there something wrong?&quot; <br/>\nand he told me he was BORED. So I said being bored isn&#39;t an excuse to <br/>\nbe rude and asked him to demonstrate a more polite reply. He perked <br/>\nup, smiled at me and did so &quot;Hi! It&#39;s nice to see you, too&quot;. And I <br/>\nasked him to be THAT polite, the next time an opportunity presented <br/>\nitself. And he said &quot;Okay.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nScenario 2: While we were waiting to leave for the graduation, my <br/>\nfriend&#39;s 11 year old girl said something complimentary to him (Nice <br/>\nhaircut) and he completely ignored her. It was like &quot;Hi Robby.&quot;  &quot;Hi <br/>\nC.&quot;  &quot;Nice haircut&quot;  and he turned his back. This not from spite or <br/>\nanything. They hadn&#39;t argued and he wasn&#39;t turning a cold shoulder. <br/>\nHe just didn&#39;t see the need to respond. So I said &quot;What dyou say, <br/>\nRob?&quot; and he turned, looked at his friend (they&#39;ve known each other <br/>\nsince birth) and said &quot;Thanks&quot; and then went outside. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had been proactive, telling them all beforehand, &quot;When you see (her <br/>\nson) say hi and congratulations.&quot; and they managed to do that, but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get a chance until after things were over and we were mingling <br/>\nat the reception.
