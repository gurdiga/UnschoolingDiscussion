There are many degrees though, so perhaps <br/>\nyour is very slight, it that is what you are experiencing. My jaws lock, <br/>\nespecially if having a migraine simultaneously. It also involves an extreme amount of <br/>\npain in the entire face. I once had my teeth cleaned and could not open my <br/>\nmouth enough to put a spoon or fork in my mouth for nearly a year. Needless to <br/>\nsay, I don&#39;t get my teeth professionally cleaned anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like all other things I have, there is always someone in far worse <br/>\ncondition than myself. We met a little boy, who was a younger brother to one of the <br/>\ngirls on the twins soccer teams, whose TMJS was so extreme, he had to wear a <br/>\nhalo, attached to his head and jaws by screws. It was absolutley heartbreaking, <br/>\nbut he was so full of life and so extremely happy. Especially when my DH <br/>\nwould let him &quot;work-out&quot; with the team. His mom was so grateful that not only did <br/>\nwe understand his condition and the risks, but that together we found an <br/>\noutlet for him to experience the fun of soccer regardless of his limitations. When <br/>\nit came time for team pictures, his mom cried when we asked that he be <br/>\nincluded. As far as we were concerned he was a part of the team, since he worked out <br/>\njust as hard as the girls did during practice. He became out little mascot. I <br/>\nguess that&#39;s one occassion where I see Kass and Kree have learned to be <br/>\ncompassionate, not only because of my crap, but because they have so much to be <br/>\nthankful for. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Mary would say....&quot;Life is Good...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74124,"nextTopicId":73465}}
