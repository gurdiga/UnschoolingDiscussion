I<br/>\nreally like her perspective in general.<br/>\n    One principle I remember is about controlling children.  Regardless of<br/>\nmethods,  if parents expect their children to make no or few choices of<br/>\ntheir own and be always &#39;obedient&#39;,   then they are more likely to rebel as<br/>\nadolescents.<br/>\n    BTW,  I&#39;m not knocking &#39;obedience&#39; per se.  It&#39;s a matter of trying to<br/>\ncontrol or not.  Some parents discourage thinking for oneself through<br/>\ncertain typye of obedience (&#39;Because I&#39;m the mom/dad and I say so&#39;,  etc.)<br/>\n    I haven&#39;t gotten any impression that you&#39;re like this,  Nanci.<br/>\nregarding timeouts specifically,  I try to use the not as punishment,  but<br/>\nas reasonable times to take a break from a situation,  get emotions in<br/>\ncheck,  and return to the situation with a clearer head.

Usually he is raring to go and wants to run off and play<br/>\n&gt;afterward, but occassionally he needs calming after a tantrum and so I will<br/>\n&gt;cuddle with him and pet him and give him lots of reassurance for a while,<br/>\n&gt;until he is ready to get down and play.

I try not to<br/>\n&gt;even raise my voice with him, as he is so sensastive that it usually makes<br/>\n&gt;him cry if I look or sound cross.  I try to make things into a game and use<br/>\n&gt;humor to teach him, as he does not get upset and is much more receptive to<br/>\n&gt;that.

We<br/>\n&gt;refer to our &quot;little&quot; guy as our gentle giant, because he is so very<br/>\n&gt;gentle, and quiet but he is the same size as his brother and both wear size<br/>\n&gt;2 or 3 clothes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On a side note, he has a really interesting personality.
