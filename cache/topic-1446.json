I <br/>\nwas recently responsible for the funeral arrangements for a friend that died <br/>\nof cancer.  I also had custody of her 10 yr old daughter.  I have a 10 yr old <br/>\nson.  My friend&#39;s daughter and I were both with my friend when she passed <br/>\naway.  (I got some flack from well-meaning people about having the kids so <br/>\ninvolved, but it seemed the right thing to do and I don&#39;t regret it)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids were very involved in the funeral arrangements.  There was, of <br/>\ncourse, the trauma of losing someone we loved.  But, what surprised me is how <br/>\ninterested the kids were in everything that happened!  They wanted to know <br/>\nwhat happens to bodies at death and afterwards.  They weren&#39;t squeamish about <br/>\nit and I think exploring the questions really helped them deal with an <br/>\noverwhelming situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the funeral, the kids wanted my friend to have flowers in her hand and not <br/>\njust on top of the casket.  Gulp!  There wasn&#39;t anyone else around and the <br/>\ntask fell to me...very spur of the moment, I might add.  I almost laughed out <br/>\nloud when I saw the funeral director&#39;s face as I reached in to position the <br/>\nflowers so they were within her grasp!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHelping the kids deal with all of it in such a kind and forthright way was <br/>\nvery enlightening for all of us!  Well worth any moments of discomfort it <br/>\nbrought to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you did a good job with your kids.
