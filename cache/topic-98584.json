More info on this would be appreciated. I had a student dentist hype me up on gum that had sorbitol in it, claiming sorbitol did not cause cavities- it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2116279221\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;chewing some anti-decay gum&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More info on this would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a student dentist hype me up on gum that had<br/>\nsorbitol in it, claiming sorbitol &#39;did not cause<br/>\ncavities- it helped fight them!&#39;<br/>\nWell!  I went out and bought a heap of gum that had<br/>\nsorbitol in it(Orbit is one brand).  I also bought<br/>\nsome Kid&#39;s Trident.  After all, it had a smiling tooth<br/>\non it!  I gave some to my 2 1/2 year old who *hated*<br/>\nbrushing his teeth and thought great, this will help! <br/>\nI warned him that gum was for chewing only, and not<br/>\neating.  He swallowed it after 3 seconds and I told<br/>\nhim that now it was going to have to come out of his<br/>\nbutthole.  That *freaked* him out.  OK, maybe I<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have mentioned it.  I then explained that<br/>\ngum was not for swallowing and when he was done to put<br/>\nit in the garbage. (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for his<br/>\ndigestive system). He practiced this alot; opening a<br/>\npiece of gum, putting it in his mouth for 3 seconds<br/>\nthen putting it in the garbage.  Over and over.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think he even bothered chewing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, to make a long story longer, I had a severe<br/>\nhive allergic reaction that I am certain was due to<br/>\nthe sorbitol in the gum.  It is just another<br/>\nartificial sweetener, after all even though it does<br/>\ncome from a fruit.  There are no super anti-cavity<br/>\npowers in it, in my opinion.  What helps in chewing<br/>\ngum is all the extra saliva that gets created.  That<br/>\nhelps to flush and loosen the bacteria in the mouth. <br/>\nI would recommend buying some natural chewing gum<br/>\nrather than gum with artificial sweeteners- especially<br/>\nsorbitol because you swallow alot of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came across sorbitol again when I was researching<br/>\nvaccine ingredients recently.  Interestingly enough,<br/>\nit is found in several vaccines including Attenuvax<br/>\n(measles), Biavax (rubella), MMR<br/>\n(measles-mumps-rubella), M-R-Vax (measles-rubella),<br/>\nMeruvax 1 (mumps), Orimune (oral polio) and YF-Vax<br/>\n(yellow fever).<br/>\nHttp://www/informedchoice.info/cocktail.html<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you google search sorbitol you can find several<br/>\nsites that go into detail of various uses for sorbitol<br/>\nand the various allergic reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI,<br/>\nJennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n_______________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
