My friend is a Reiki","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1258624998\">Nicki,<br/>\nI&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re hurting!<br/>\nI was in an accident and suffered from severe<br/>\nwhiplash. I had hideous migraines several times a<br/>\nmonth. My friend is a Reiki master and gave me Reiki<br/>\none. The migraines have now subsided to about 1 every<br/>\nfew months or so and are getting less and less<br/>\nfrequent. The great thing about Reiki for me is that I<br/>\ncan do it to myself at no cost anytime I feel the<br/>\nsigns of a migraine coming on. I don&#39;t even have to be<br/>\nat home (I&#39;ve done it in a public restroom, my car,<br/>\netc.). Even if it doesn&#39;t make it go away completely,<br/>\nthe pain is much less intense after a treatment. The<br/>\nother thing that helps me is an Ibuprofen (motrin) gel<br/>\nthat you rub into your skin. I get mine from the UK<br/>\n(friends bring it to me) and I don&#39;t know if you can<br/>\nget it here but your doctor may know of it. It&#39;s the<br/>\nonly med that I use or need when &#39;under attack&#39;. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if it would help with the nerve pain but it<br/>\nworks great on any muscle related pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I was in an accident 7 years ago and have nerve<br/>\ndamage and soft <br/>\ntissue <br/>\nproblems in my back. I was on so many different meds<br/>\nand had a bout w/ <br/>\nulcerative colitis and then a problem was caught 2<br/>\nweeks before they <br/>\ntook my <br/>\none med off the market for killing people. Lovely.<br/>\nRight now I have a <br/>\nmajor <br/>\nheadache from my neck and my back is burning and<br/>\nkilling me, I&#39;ll be up <br/>\nmost <br/>\nof the night. I refuse to take anything anymore<br/>\nthough. I only wish I <br/>\ncould <br/>\nafford my therapies more than once a month. I would<br/>\nfeel 100 times <br/>\nbetter w/ <br/>\nweekly or more treatments for a period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n   We all do what we have to for ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n   NICKI~&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
