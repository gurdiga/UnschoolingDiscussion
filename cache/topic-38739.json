Learning about the renaissance could lead to learning <br/>\nabout the different type of Art and learning to draw / paint/ sculpt. <br/>\nLearning about the black plaugue could lead to an interest in health, <br/>\ndisease, biology, (you know the growing the mold on the bread ... look <br/>\nmom I grew penicillin lol){{and realize that many of these things would <br/>\nbe happening simutaneously..}}}<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that as you provide a home that is filled with oppurtuniity <br/>\nfor learning then your child will lead him/herself to the things they <br/>\nwant to know.
