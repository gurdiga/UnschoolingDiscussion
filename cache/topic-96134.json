I really appreciated Julie&#39;s comment <br/>\nthat is something is essential, he will learn it. Smack! (That&#39;s me smnacking my forehead.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we began talking on thie list an amazing thing happened. My older son is a huge <br/>\nTolkien fan and I suggested to him that he make a map with his own world in it. (He was <br/>\nasking for some creativity suggestions for summer.) We had spent a bunch of time with a <br/>\nglobe and maps and flags last year due to their interest in countries/continents (spawned <br/>\nby Survivor, of all things).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the three younger kids (including my 10 yo) jumped on the idea and have been <br/>\ndrawing and creating for days now. My 10 yo who &quot;hates to write&quot;? Well, he&#39;s drawn his <br/>\nown map of an island chain, has labeled all the islands, designed flags for each island, <br/>\ncreated gods to rule the islands, has drawn a page of swords and is now drawing the ships <br/>\nfor his navy. I&#39;m in shock. This is all in the last three days. He even wants the TV off and is <br/>\npreferring this work to playing Star Craft on the computer. He has done so much on <br/>\ncomputer gaming that he has inside all these stories and names and conflicts to pour out <br/>\nin his own way and suddenly being given a way to do it has caught his attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite moment: he wrote the word &quot;aguelar&quot; (name of an island he made up) and said, <br/>\n&quot;Look at my perfect letter &#39;a&#39;.&quot; And it was perfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been so busy helping them find resources for their projects (all three are <br/>\nkeeping notebooks to design their &quot;worlds&quot;) I haven&#39;t had time to thank you all for your <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny how quickly despair can turn to hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96024,"nextTopicId":96084}}
