(I was","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1632476222\">Good Morning,<br/>\nI find that in some areas of Providence, this mentality applies.. When I was first awarded placement of Brianna, I searched for day care. (I was finishing a degree program and working.) The competition for some of the &#39;pre-school enrichment & learning centers&#39; was fierce!! <br/>\nThe state was helping me pay for this, so I thought that with the state money and what I could afford, Brianna would be in a great day care program. <br/>\nMy college courses were 4 days per week. 9AM-11:45AM. I found a day care that was seemingly okay. They concentrated on organized activities. They promised &quot;learning adventures&quot; This day care was one of the most desired in the area!<br/>\nI would drop her off at around 8:20 AM and usually I was there by noon. I must say that the day care required payment for a full day (7AM-5:30PM).<br/>\nOne day, due to a major traffic problem, I arrived there at approx 12:45 PM. I had called the office and explained the traffic situation. The office person put me on hold. The director came on and asked me when I would be there. I honestly couldn&#39;t give an answer. I was in traffic, it was beyond my control. She informed me that our agreement was that I pick Brianna up around noon. I pointed out that the center was getting paid for full time day care and had been, in fact, providing part time day care, I also said that this was very unusual for me to be late and that I really didn&#39;t see the problem.<br/>\nWhen I arrived, Brianna was sitting out by the double locked doors - by herself- with her little school bag and jacket. She was frightened. Just a few feet away - in her classroom, the kids were playing.<br/>\nWhen the secretary came to open the door for me, I was pissed! I wanted to speak to the administrator, but was told she was busy. I could see the office, the woman was eating a salad & reading Cosmo.<br/>\nI picked Brianna up and walked into the administrators office. I fired them.<br/>\nNot only did I pull Brianna out, I put a stop payment on the check and had this daycare stricken from the state rolls so the state wouldn&#39;t pay for them anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, this action of theirs was part & parcel of training the kids. The administrator told me that Brianna needed to be disciplined, trained - that she was spoiled. (At this time, Brianna had seen goddess knows what while in custody of her bio-mom who was an iv drug user.) Brianna was & remains a rather quiet kid. Back then, she was very quiet. kids used to take her snacks, her toys and she would say & do nothing. I couldn&#39;t understand what this cosmos reading woman was talking about!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the rest of the semester, Brianna went into another day care that was so much better, however, it was serendipitous that I got her in there!! It was also over $100.00 per week more!! (thank goddess for the state help!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time after the experience w/ the first day care, Brianna was very wary of doing ANYTHING!!! w/o asking! She would get visibly upset over &quot;being wrong&quot; in writing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nall in all - it was terrible for Brianna.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 19, 2003 8:01 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Definition of unschooling, was; FLORIDA Intro<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;When someone with a one year old says &quot;unschooling&quot; the question is &quot;as<br/>\n  &gt;opposed to what?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d have to say, as opposed enrolling the kid in my next door neighbor&#39;s <br/>\n  licensed-for-12-we-do-activities-at-10am and <br/>\n  3pm-and-structure-everything-else-too day care.

If so, someone could have a kid in <br/>\nschool, but not restrict food and games, and say they were unschooling all <br/>\nexcept for one thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling is how the family is dealing with laws about compulsory <br/>\neducation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the INSIDE of unschooling there are lots of things to know and consider, <br/>\nbut from the outside, what it is from the outside, is not having kids in <br/>\nschool and also not using a curriculum nor school-style teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone does all the kinds of things we&#39;re talking about with a two year <br/>\nold, well!  THEY SHOULD!   And if someone does all these things until a child <br/>\nis five and then sends him to school, I don&#39;t even NEARLY see it as &quot;we <br/>\nunschooled until he was five.&quot;   They just provided him a wonderful <br/>\npre-school experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers feel differently, but without the necessary move and courage of saying <br/>\nno when compulsory school-age comes, I don&#39;t consider any treatment of an <br/>\nunder-five-year-old to be unschooling (personally, myself) no matter what <br/>\ntheir neighbors or sisters were doing with THEIR two and four year olds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has an eight year old who has never been to school and says &quot;We&#39;ve <br/>\nhomeschooled for three years,&quot; I&#39;ll count that as three years.  If someone <br/>\nhas a three year old and says &quot;we&#39;ve homeschooled for three years&quot; I&#39;ll <br/>\ndiscount it entirely.  We still don&#39;t know if two years hence that kid will <br/>\nbe in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118359131,"authorName":"Laramike12@aol.com","from":"Laramike12@...","profile":"laralarahun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Definition of unschooling, was; FLORIDA Intro","postDate":"1050776634","msgId":65489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE2LjM2OWM1YjE2LjJiZDJlZTNhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":65491,"prevInTime":65488,"nextInTime":65490,"topicId":65489,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/19/03 3:55:10 PM, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1002684072\">In a message dated 4/19/03 3:55:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It was, for us, an extension of the warm and fun things we had been doing <br/>\nbefore Kirby was schoolage.
