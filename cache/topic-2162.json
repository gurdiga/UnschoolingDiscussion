These<br/>\nchildren come from stressed families with a multitude of problems, of<br/>\ncourse, but school is the only safe place, the only place they get a meal,<br/>\nand the teacher is the only consistant person in thier lives. Not all<br/>\nparents are responsible and loving and the schools can help children in<br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother instance is with children with handicaps (mental, physical,<br/>\nmultiple, etc.). School gives these parents a much needed break and access<br/>\nto resources that would otherwise be difficult to find.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know kids who love school and thrive in the environment. And I know<br/>\nparents who should not home/unschool. It is about choices, not proving our<br/>\nchoice is better for everyone, just better for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa F.<br/>\n<br/>\nlinjoy w wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: linjoy w &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:linjoy1@...\">linjoy1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There really are children who enjoy going to school.
