His chapter on &quot;What to expect of your child&quot; says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Children must, of course, be guided toward responsible adult <br/>\nbehavior, but parents shouldn&#39;t expect them to achieve it all at <br/>\nonce.  Nor is there any convincing evidence that it can be <br/>\neffectively achieved by emplying the old maxim &quot;spare the rod and <br/>\nspoil the child.&quot;  Corporal punishment at  any age confuses and <br/>\ntraumatizes the child, because he can&#39;t understand why the mother and <br/>\nfather he loves, and who are supposed to love him, are suddenly <br/>\nraging at him and causing physical pain.  He is made to feel <br/>\ninsecure, resentful, and even worthless, and the consequence may be <br/>\npsychological harm.<br/>\nThe impact of physical punishment on child deveolpment has been <br/>\nstudied extensively, and the consensus of this research is that <br/>\nviolence damages both parent and child.  It fails to teach children <br/>\nWHAT TO DO and yields only temporary benefits, if that, in teaching <br/>\nthem WHAT NOT TO DO.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWise words imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85119,"nextTopicId":85177}}
