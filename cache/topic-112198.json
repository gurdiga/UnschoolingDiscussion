I think it showed good examples of unschooling.<br/>\n However, the Los Angeles educator they talked to seemed to act as<br/>\nthough all students are supposed to be interested in a higher level<br/>\nchemistry class, or that all people use world history and geography in<br/>\ntheir daily lives.<br/>\nI do have one opinion now about a lot of this.  As an adult, I learn<br/>\nwhat I am interested in.  When I was in school, I may have memorized<br/>\nmany facts for tests, but mainly actually learned only what I was<br/>\ninterested in.
