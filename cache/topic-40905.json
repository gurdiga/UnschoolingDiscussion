My dad collects stamps (he&#39;s a philatelist, a word I learned when I was really young because of him). When I get any mail with stamps, I carefully slit the envelope and save it, and then I bring them to him. To me, they all look about the same, although I&#39;m starting to catch the interesting cancels and the coil numbers, if I look. To him, though, it&#39;s a whole world with it&#39;s own intricacies and meanings. He bought an old stamp collection at a yard sale a year or so ago and it was a wonderful find, first because it included about $150 in &quot;postally unused&quot; US stamps that he can now just put on letters, but also because the rest was so disorganized that he had hours of joy just sorting through it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also dabbles in lepidoptery (butterfly collecting), and can tell at twenty feet that a yellow butterfly that looks just like all the other yellow butterflies flying around a meadow is something totally different - maybe because of the way it&#39;s flying, or some other minute detail. Again, the minutiae involved is amazing. I&#39;ve learned just enough to realize how much I don&#39;t know (I can identify common butterflies like monarchs and painted ladies and the ubiquitous cabbage white) but he knows a lot more... and he still talks about other people who are more-expert, about this guy living in this small town who is an expert on a certain kind of little green moth.... do you realize how many little brown moths have never been identified or classified? There are so many of them... there are probably moths coming to your outside light at night that have no name at all...<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember watching a movie once about the world living in a drop of water, and I  think I&#39;m just now realizimg how many drops of water there are, how many worlds. It&#39;s all truly incredible, and I feel like a guest at a huge and wonderful feast, sitting before a table piled high with knowledge of all shapes and sizes. It&#39;s wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I thought I knew every animal in the world, because the same ones appeared over and over in storybooks and zoos and no one ever suggested there were others. Seeing a llama rocked my little world, and opened doors to knowledge I had never imagined was there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling is seeing how many worlds there are to know, and being free to immerse yourself in the ones or ones that you chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] puzzling  (was historical  interests of 9 yr. old boys.)","postDate":"1029256889","msgId":40924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAyMDgxMzA5Mzk0Mi4wMjAwNjI1MEBwb3AuaXNsYW5kbmV0LmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwLjIzNGQyZWYxLjJhOGE4MjlhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40917,"nextInTopic":40927,"prevInTime":40923,"nextInTime":40925,"topicId":40905,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This whole post is just excellent, Pam.
