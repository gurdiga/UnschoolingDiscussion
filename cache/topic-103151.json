Most exchange groups are set up so the student goes <br/>\nto school, so it might fill a need for international homeschoolers. <br/>\nOtherwise, i think it would be better to go with an established <br/>\norganization. There are situations that arise in which the &quot;fit&quot; <br/>\nisnt right, and the student asks to be placed with another family, <br/>\nso with an established group there are more options. And the point <br/>\nof the student coming here would be to immerse him/herself in OUR <br/>\nculture, not really vice versa (although you would learn alot about <br/>\nanother culture anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want that same kind of immersion, why not try visiting areas <br/>\nin your city that have a large percentage of whatever nationality <br/>\nyou are focusing on. Visit ethnic restaurants, go to festivals, rent <br/>\nmovies in that language, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Foreign Exchange Homeschooling experience...","postDate":"1107665402","msgId":103152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCMEZGQjI3LjQ5MkU2Mzg1LjBCOTdBM0ZCQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":103151,"nextInTopic":103158,"prevInTime":103151,"nextInTime":103153,"topicId":103151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
