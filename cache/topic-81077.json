Sometimes I will realize a <br/>\nthought or  idea or memory, and I will begin to trace back in my mind how I came <br/>\nto that particular &quot;conclusion&quot;   It is always a wild ride back through my <br/>\ntrain of thought.  I have seriously considered writing a book called &quot;Tangents&quot;  <br/>\nor.. &quot;Multi Tracked Mind&quot;  or  &quot;Origins of Totally Unrelated Thoughts&quot;  LOL.. <br/>\nBut, I haven&#39;t actually done it.. Mostly because when I am doing this mind <br/>\ntracking, I am not in a postion to write the thoughts down, and I can&#39;t remember <br/>\nthem later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaking these types of connections, to me, is the essence of unschooling.   <br/>\nSandra talked about &quot;connecting the dots&quot; at the conference.    The recent <br/>\ndiscussions are evidence of how this works.    Cool, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81057,"nextTopicId":81079}}
