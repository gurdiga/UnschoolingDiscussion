We are taking trip to the<br/>\nGrand Canyon next week. The kids got to pic the place we went to and help<br/>\nDad to plan the trip. My question is, (given their ages and the fact that we<br/>\nare unschooling now, meaning no requirements to do anything :school:<br/>\nrelated) can I help them to learn more than they already will while on the<br/>\ntrip? My son has already said he wants to take his journal to write in, he<br/>\nlikes reading his writing later on. I have also bought them disposable<br/>\ncameras to use as they wish on the trip. They asked for books on the Grand<br/>\nCanyon from the library and we have done that.

We are taking trip to the Grand Canyon next week. The kids got to pic the place we went to and help Dad to plan the trip. My question is, (given their ages and the fact that we are unschooling now, meaning no requirements to do anything :school: related) can I help them to learn more than they already will while on the trip? My son has already said he wants to take his journal to write in, he likes reading his writing later on. I have also bought them disposable cameras to use as they wish on the trip. They asked for books on the Grand Canyon from the library and we have done that.
