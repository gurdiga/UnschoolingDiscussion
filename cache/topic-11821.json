He looks the same<br/>\nas when I saw him 20 years ago (we actually look like twins.)  He&#39;s now grayer.<br/>\nSo am I.  We both need some of that &quot;Hair Dye for Men&quot; (purple and green).  Amjad<br/>\nAli Khan is the latest in along line of musicians from Gwalior dating back to the<br/>\ntime of Akbar the Great (he played some of the music from his great, great, great,<br/>\netc., etc. from the 16th century, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Aliyah decided to wear one of her South Indian performing outfits.  She<br/>\nknew it was North Indian music, but she wanted to show it off again while it<br/>\nstill fits (and we don&#39;t have any performances coming up.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Concert was sensational!!! but only 3 1/2 hours long (in India, it would<br/>\nhave been at least 5 1/2).  Indian man comes over to Aliyah and asks, &quot;Do you know<br/>\nwhat you just heard?&quot; &quot;Yes, Rag Darbari.  Actually, it is the North Indian<br/>\nequivalent of the Carnatic raga Kilvilley.&quot; Man walked away opened mouthed, he was only trying to make polite conversation with the pale skin.  Now I remember why she likes to write &quot;modal&quot; music.<br/>\n<br/>\n Got up at 5:30 a.m. By the breakfast place, I see a berry bush.  &quot;What<br/>\nkind?&quot; I  ask.  &quot;Salida(?) or Oregon Grape&quot;, she says.  (I believe her -- last week<br/>\nshe brought home thimbleberries to make compote, and I had to ask her whether<br/>\nthey were edible too.)  So, &quot;edible&quot;?  &quot;Salida is not tasty&quot;, she says,<br/>\n&quot;Oregon Grape&quot; is very bitter.  But very good for you if you get sick from bad water.<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried it.&quot;  (You can imagine my attempt to keep an interested, less than overly concerned look on my New York face.)<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Our woods though have been invaded by poison hemlock.  Looks almost like<br/>\nQueen Anne&#39;s Lace, so you have to be careful.&quot;  She laughs -- she knows I&#39;m not<br/>\nlikelyto eat ANYTHING which comes from the woods unless she gives it to me.<br/>\n&quot;There&#39;s a beautiful purple-flowered member of the nightshade family, too.  Quite<br/>\ndeadly.&quot; &quot;Oh,  well I won&#39;t eat it.&quot; I joke. &quot;No, the problem is people pick flowers, and then put their hands in their mouths.&quot;  So I promised not to pick any flowers in the<br/>\nwoods until  she got back. (I never do anyway!)<br/>\n<br/>\n Over breakfast, she informs me that a subspecies of Eurasian cuckoo<br/>\nproves that birds can count. I bite: &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Well, as you know, they lay their eggs<br/>\nin the nests of other birds, who also feed the hatchlings. Can look pretty<br/>\nfunny, seeing a lark trying to feed a cuckoo. They can change the color of their eggs<br/>\n(not their size) to match those of the eggs in the nest.  But with this subspecies,<br/>\nfor every one egg the cuckoo lays, she throws one of the other ones out of the<br/>\nnest.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Well, that only proves the cuckoo can count!&quot; I say.<br/>\n&quot;Good point,&quot; she notes.
