So<br/>\nuntil they are ready/mature-enough they won&#39;t know everything.

I am sure of the negative response I<br/>\n&gt; would get and I don&#39;t want to hear it.

And, when he found out that we were not vaccinating<br/>\n&gt; my daughter, he told me he would kill me if anything happened to her!  He<br/>\n&gt; thinks I am a total nut and often talks behind my back to other members of<br/>\n&gt; the family.  So you can see why I didn&#39;t rush to tell him she&#39;s unschooled!<br/>\n&gt; The only thing is, I feel like maybe now we should tell since we are sure<br/>\n&gt; that she will again be home next year.

I have no support for homeschooling on my side of the family<br/>\n&gt;except my husband (whose idea it orginally was to hs)and my children<br/>\n&gt;who are totally all for it. I love having my children home with me<br/>\n&gt;all day long and enjoy being with them. I just started the<br/>\n&gt;unschooling approach about a month or two ago. I love it and so do<br/>\n&gt;the children! I would never send them back to ps again unless the<br/>\n&gt;children insisted that they wanted to go. But, I don&#39;t think that<br/>\n&gt;will happen anytime soon! Anyway my problem is my mom. She just<br/>\n&gt;totally opposes the idea of homeschooling especially unschooling. I<br/>\n&gt;tried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from<br/>\n&gt;her so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all. She<br/>\n&gt;is so narrow minded on the subject and argues that the kids &quot;will<br/>\n&gt;never learn beyond what I know or what&#39;s around them to know.&quot; I<br/>\n&gt;tried to tell her that children will learn in any area that interests<br/>\n&gt;them far beyond what I know or can tell them. That I have learned far<br/>\n&gt;beyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to<br/>\n&gt;learn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life<br/>\n&gt;or raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation<br/>\n&gt;better? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for<br/>\n&gt;what I feel like is best for my children. Then I start wondering if<br/>\n&gt;they won&#39;t learn properly. Will they learn enough by unschooling. Can<br/>\n&gt;anyone reassure me of my decision to homeschool?<br/>\n&gt;Lisa, whose confused and upset at the moment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free Email at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"hartshape2@aol.com","from":"hartshape2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"cCit0dsk82AO5lHUxeePEURDw9XDOs_sg79D9SWYm9G9MOlEpD5KyTEkRvdZfsQpv7K9_1D1B7_K","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Advice Needed","postDate":"954345770","msgId":7424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhLjMxNmMzODIuMjYxMzgzMmFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7420,"nextInTopic":8062,"prevInTime":7423,"nextInTime":7425,"topicId":7224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 03/29/2000 7:53:16 AM Central Standard Time, ...

Depending on the<br/>\nexperiences your children have had in school, you&#39;ll need to take time to<br/>\njust veg out and take a look around. Get to know each other again.  If your<br/>\nchildren have been hurt then this transition time is a healing time.   We<br/>\nneed to know more about your girls to help you see what might happen at<br/>\nfirst.

I love taking them<br/>\non field trips.  We all enjoy reading and researching info<br/>\non the web so I believe we can be much happier with<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling.  I want my kids to be self<br/>\ndirected but I also believe I need to guide them into<br/>\nsubject matter that they wouldn&#39;t be interested in so they<br/>\ncan be more well rounded.  Does anyone out there use a<br/>\ncurriculum or any part of one?  There are so many sources of<br/>\ninformation that I&#39;m a bit nervous.  Math & Science are<br/>\nsubjects in which I would need help.  I also think I would<br/>\nneed to chart their progress on a monthly or quarterly<br/>\nbasis.  At least until I am more comfortable with it!   How<br/>\nabout testing?  Do you test?  How often?  Where/when are<br/>\nthese hs conferences held?<br/>\nI will read the books suggested and have already checked the<br/>\nweb sites so thanks again for the guidance.

He didn&#39;t tell me about his doubts until we were three months into it, <br/>\nat which time the results he was seeing erased any doubts he had. Back then <br/>\nwe were doing a more structured school day. As of January, my 9 yod convinced <br/>\nme, by way of how much she was learning during our holiday, that unschooling <br/>\nwas the best method for her. Dh has *major* doubts and concerns about this <br/>\nstyle of hsing. No matter how much I explain to him, he thinks it it just <br/>\nkids sitting around never doing anything. He doesn&#39;t believe kids will be <br/>\ninterested in doing anything that is even slightly challenging or difficult, <br/>\nunless you force them.<br/>\nWhat I have started doing, inspired by Betsy who is also on this list, is <br/>\nwriting down, in a daily journal,  the main topics we cover and the <br/>\nactivities she participates in. I even keep notes on what my 18mod does, for <br/>\nsentimental value. Although I don&#39;t break things down to specific subjects, <br/>\nit might be helpfu. Of course, this might not go over too well during the <br/>\ndeschooling period, but it&#39;s an idea for the future. Dh likes to see <br/>\nquantifiable things. I am also considering a test of basic skills at some <br/>\npoint. It will help allay his fears and get him on board and dd has no test <br/>\nanxiety.<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\ncandice</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"kayelle42@aol.com","from":"kayelle42@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lJ79byRZPGY0ydmmWdH35VBLUqutQOBSCZdQ1lhlMyYKRcVNw86RlL378_S8_XImV5EjxC0yATQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Advice Needed","postDate":"953767046","msgId":7239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4LjNhM2FlMTAuMjYwYWFlODZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7238,"nextInTopic":7240,"prevInTime":7238,"nextInTime":7240,"topicId":7224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yvonne, Good luck to you with your son.

Then after watching <br/>\n&gt; them deschooling you may find [as I did] that your children learn <br/>\n&gt; lots of stuff without being taught.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This can be a difficult concept to grasp while still in the school <br/>\n&gt; mindset, where we are encouraged to believe that children are <br/>\n&gt; empty vessels just waiting to be filled with information, and that the <br/>\n&gt; only way you can fill their heads is to force feed them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I believe that nothing could possibly be further from the truth, why <br/>\n&gt; look at all an infant learns in its first few years on the planet, a <br/>\n&gt; whole language, lots of complicated interactions between people, <br/>\n&gt; they know so much about the world, and no-one ever sat them at a <br/>\n&gt; desk and made them &quot;learn&quot;.   Real learning comes from curiosity <br/>\n&gt; and needs, and schooling merely seems to limit these things.  The <br/>\n&gt; flame of curiosity is all but extinguished by schools attempt to <br/>\n&gt; make learning such a big deal, and when locked away from the real <br/>\n&gt; world for so many hours each day children have little in the way of <br/>\n&gt; needs, except maybe to escape from education.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have found that my daughter [1 1/2 years in school] and my son <br/>\n&gt; [6yrs in school] have regained that natural curiosity, it took very <br/>\n&gt; little time for my daughter but my son veged out and did nothing <br/>\n&gt; that seemed to indicate any return of his spirit for almost a year.  <br/>\n&gt; Now after over three years away from school&#39;s damaging influence <br/>\n&gt; they are real learners following their interests and needs and <br/>\n&gt; teaching themselves through interaction with others, real life <br/>\n&gt; experiences, the internet, cd roms, books etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; UNSCHOOLING IS GREAT ! ! ! ! ! ! !  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -  Sue   -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt; My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm\">http://homepage.rconnect.com/winfarm</a><br/>\n&gt; Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;To believe in something, and not to live it, is to be dishonest.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; -Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; PERFORM CPR ON YOUR APR!<br/>\n&gt; Get a NextCard Visa, in 30 seconds!

By taking <br/>\nso many hours of our children&#39;s lives and putting them on the <br/>\nschool treadmill they steal so much from them.  Time is so <br/>\nimportant, childhood does not last for very long and the mind is so <br/>\nlike a sponge ready to absorb all sorts of things.  School teaches <br/>\nthat nothing is ever so important that the bell can be ignored, no <br/>\nmatter how interested some children may be in a certain lesson, <br/>\nthe bell rings and they are meant to switch their minds off that <br/>\nsubject and onto another.

The internet on the other hand <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really place time limits on a child&#39;s curiosity, and doesn&#39;t <br/>\nrequire that they sit still and &quot;watch the whole show&quot; like with <br/>\nsome documentary on television.

My 11 year old daughter was in public school until I took <br/>\n&gt; her out in the middle of fourth grade.  This past sept. began our first <br/>\n&gt; attempt to try to unschool.  I must say I have been very frustrated as it <br/>\n&gt; seems that she has no interest in doing anything except play!  She is a very <br/>\n&gt; creative and imaginative child;  the public school experience for her was <br/>\n&gt; like putting a bird into a cage.  I saw her spirit which I admire and envy, <br/>\n&gt; being completely stifled.  But at home she seemed so uninterested in anything <br/>\n&gt; I would really call learning.  Even when we go to the library, she&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; sometimes just sit there with no interest in finding a book.  I usually pick <br/>\n&gt; the books and then read them to her.  I have been thinking that the public <br/>\n&gt; school experience turned her off completely to anything that even looks like <br/>\n&gt; learning.

It has helped me to ask many <br/>\nquestions, and to read everything I can get my hands on.  Also, because I am <br/>\na former teacher, I have to really work on relaxing, and not pushing too <br/>\nmuch.  This is hard for me, but I am working at it, earnestly.  One thing <br/>\nthat I will say, is to try not to re-create school in your own home.  In my <br/>\nopinion, it defeats the purpose of taking your kids out of school.  You will <br/>\nnot need to create a rigid schedule that cannot be deviated from, and you <br/>\nwill not need to have desks for your children and yourself.  You can &quot;teach&quot; <br/>\non the front porch, in the car, stretched out on the floor, etc...  Be <br/>\ncomfortable with each other.  If everyone is tired, do not push ; you will <br/>\nhave that freedom, that teachers and students do not, so take advantage of <br/>\nthat freedom.  Your children will benefit from it.  Also, do not think you <br/>\nhave to make everything into a lesson-- this can lead to burn out.  You do <br/>\nnot need to worry that you need to have your children doing something on task <br/>\nfor 6hrs a day!  Micki Colfax, author of Hard Times in Paradise, and <br/>\nHomeschooling For Excellence said that  if you give your child 2 hrs a day of <br/>\none on one time, he or she will achieve in one year 3times the amount of on <br/>\ntask time when compared to conventionally schooled children.   You can&#39;t beat <br/>\nthat!     Relax, and enjoy, and congratulations on taking charge of your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s education!                                                           <br/>\n                        Karen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"monkeycoop@aol.com","from":"monkeycoop@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"OdMndWsW6UGIGvoOHFbmRA7b-8xIipPWRMMTNKWt3xSoKGY9pLmlbx2-Rp-gN37LCyUZVL9iQoED","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Advice Needed","postDate":"953734689","msgId":7227,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0LjIzYTkwNmIuMjYwYTMwMjFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7226,"nextInTopic":7228,"prevInTime":7226,"nextInTime":7228,"topicId":7224,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/22/00 1:39:10 AM Central Standard Time, libbygirl@xtra.co.NZ writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-458909648\">In a message dated 3/22/00 1:39:10 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:libbygirl@...\">libbygirl@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  Unschooling is life and as Auntie Mame puts<br/>\n is &quot;Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this quote.

If <br/>\nyour kids are bright or gifted, imo, ps doesn&#39;t challenge or even offer new <br/>\nmaterial often enough to make it liveable.  At least around here!  (Martin <br/>\nCounty, Florida).  (My kids: 6 3/4 yo son and 5 yo daughter, FYI.  So we&#39;re <br/>\npretty new to all of this too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it seems to me that&#39;s why you are headed in this direction too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, unschooling is quite different from other types of hsing.   So you will <br/>\nprobably want to read all about those differences.  Your library might have a <br/>\ngood book or 2 on the different schools of hsing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, just to make your life more complicated, unschooling is done in a number <br/>\nof different ways, differing from family to family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the bottom line is that you have to take some time and figure out <br/>\nwhat works for you and yours.  Use some curriculum or not, outside lessons or <br/>\nnot, join a support group or not, live at the library or not, etc.  We do <br/>\nsome of all of the above and it is constantly changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne sanity check I did at the beginning was to go online to the state&#39;s <br/>\nstandards (if you are in Fla I can tell you the web site, if not it&#39;s pretty <br/>\neasy to find).  These are a line-by-line description of what the schools are <br/>\nsupposed to be teaching the kids at each age.  It was not impressive, except <br/>\nin its volume.  But once I read thru what was expected at each grade level, I <br/>\nKNEW we could and would do so much more.  So, that was reassuring.  And, even <br/>\nif that is not your focus, and for many folks it is not, it might give you <br/>\nsome ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I think you have to explore and read, maybe ask your 9 yo <br/>\nwhat she wants to do (but if she&#39;s anything like my kids it will change), <br/>\ntalk to everyone (you&#39;d be surprised how many of us there are out there) and <br/>\nget comfortable with the whole idea yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a friendly list that is good for bouncing ideas off of if you run <br/>\ninto any questions.
