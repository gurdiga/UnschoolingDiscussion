My oldest,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1961631514\">Hi,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy name is Beverly Hernandez, I&#39;ve been homeschooling for many years.  I have 3 children all of whom were homeschooled from the beginning.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy oldest, Julee, is now 19, married (I&#39;m a grandma).  Her first day of school was at college at 16.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy second, Jessica, is 15, a senior.  This year we&#39;ll be finishing up a few subjects and she will be going to a local culinary arts school.  She wants to be a chef.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy baby, Joshua, just turned 13, is in the 8th grade.  I&#39;ll be concentrating on him this year because he&#39;s been in the background for a while, with the wedding and baby and all.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy husband has his own business, has for years.  We&#39;ve struggled, but God always provides.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;ve run a large ISP in the past and use to have a homeschool bookstore. Now I run a small support group at my church - 7 families - very relaxed and\r<br/>\nlow key.  And I just became the About.com homeschooling guide.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m having a lot of fun with that.  I&#39;m trying to make the site user-friendly, a place where you can find things that you can use in your everyday homeschooling. I&#39;m also trying to make it a fun place for the kids.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThe reason I&#39;m on different lists right now is because I have a lot of learning to do.  The homeschooling world is very diversified.  I know the homeschooling world from the point of view that I have experienced - a Christian group - but I&#39;m learning that there are many different views out there, many different groups, many different philosophies.  I have to approach the site I just took on from a neutral corner and represent many\r<br/>\ndifferent things that I do not know too much about.  Like MOTH for instance - I ran into people talking about moth - What is moth?  I had to go find out.  I&#39;m very interested in it, it would probably help me a lot.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI use Beyond five in a row and I love it.  I can&#39;t wait to get back started this year - but I have been so busy with about.com, I haven&#39;t had much planning time yet.  I&#39;m shooting for September 8 starting date.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s us.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks,\r<br/>\nBeverly\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nP.S.  The site I wanted to share is:\r<br/>\nFree software for homeschoolers\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.about.com/library/weekly/aa080399.htm\">http://homeschooling.about.com/library/weekly/aa080399.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1830,"nextTopicId":1834}}
