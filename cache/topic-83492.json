It also contributes to overweight kids, poor <br/>\n&gt; eye sight, ability to concentrate, and I can&#39;t remember what else.  I will <br/>\n&gt; stress these are not my beliefs but things I have picked up from reading, <br/>\n&gt; emails , and talking with NO TV proponents.  I had copies of some of the different <br/>\n&gt; studies done in Japan about screen time and brain function.  (I&#39;ll note here <br/>\n&gt; that they were the actual study reports not some persons idea of what those <br/>\n&gt; reports had to say)  Unfortunately my pc blasted off into pop-up spamdem <br/>\n&gt; trogen hell and the files along with all else on my pc were lost.  I&#39;ve hunted <br/>\n&gt; for them and found two but they were the Japanese version and the translation <br/>\n&gt; was not very accurate.  From what I did read there is evidence that yes it <br/>\n&gt; does use parts of the brain differently or different part of the brain in <br/>\n&gt; combination, than any other activity. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83426,"nextTopicId":83505}}
