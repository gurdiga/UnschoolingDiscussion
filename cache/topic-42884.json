Often people don&#39;t believe it.<br/>\nAnd if they DO believe it, they get pissed off.<br/>\nOr they say I bought that happiness at the expense of not teaching my kids to <br/>\ntake care of themselves when they&#39;re grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is, my kids take really good care of the things they&#39;ve chosen to prize <br/>\nand care about.  Every one of them has things from when they were babies, or <br/>\ntoddlers, and some of those things are paper, or otherwise fragile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I walked to the video store to get Marty&#39;s list of movies (I got <br/>\nfour of five) because he&#39;s had a cold and needed to just stay home today.   <br/>\nHe watched two last night.  He was sitting watching one this afternoon, after <br/>\neating chicken soup with me and Holly, when Keith came home and wanted Marty <br/>\nto go with him to deliver the big TV to the repair shop.  So Marty had to <br/>\nchange shirts, put on pants and shoes, and go outside, which he hadn&#39;t <br/>\nplanned to do.  But he didn&#39;t whine one bit.  When he gets home he&#39;ll watch <br/>\nthat movie some more and we&#39;ll all be calm and appreciative of each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] The Joy of Yes","postDate":"1031173839","msgId":42884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTIwMWMyNTQ1NyQ4NWEwZWZjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PEYyOGlNQ0lxdFF2QWF1TmpWdU0wMDAwMDFmOUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42892,"prevInTime":42883,"nextInTime":42885,"topicId":42884,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
