But as I said before, I also know personally<br/>\nas a teacher&#39;s daughter that it is becoming increasingly<br/>\noverperscribed to children who really don&#39;t need it at all.<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n{this is the printer version}<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.carolinajournal.com/print/print_issue.html?id=146\">http://www.carolinajournal.com/print/print_issue.html?id=146</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nIn some schools, Dr. Sax said, mandated tests have eliminated recess<br/>\naltogether. He also said standardized testing has compelled<br/>\nelementary-school curriculum to speed up, forcing children in<br/>\nkindergarten to put down their blocks, dress-up clothes, and<br/>\nshow-and-tell items in order to master reading and writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDemanding attention all day<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem, Dr. Sax said, is 5-, 6- and 7-year-old children,<br/>\nespecially boys, are not at an appropriate age to sit through a day<br/>\nthat consists entirely of reading, writing, and arithmetic. They<br/>\nfind it difficult to pay attention. �I�ve seen this happen many<br/>\ntimes,� Dr. Sax said. �Sometime around the end of first grade or the<br/>\nbeginning of second, the boy�s parents are summoned to the school<br/>\nfor a team meeting. �Johnny isn�t reading at grade level,� the<br/>\ncounselor tells the parents. �He doesn�t pay attention,� the teacher<br/>\nadds. �He may have ADD,� the psychologist warns. �We think you<br/>\nshould speak with your child�s doctor about getting your son on<br/>\nRitalin.�� <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I also agree with this snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n �We�re literally knocking out our brightest and most active<br/>\nchildren,� he said. �We are the first adults to handle the<br/>\ngeneration gap through the wholesale drugging of our children,� <br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
