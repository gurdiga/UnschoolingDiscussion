It is just a little<br/>\ndifficult grasping a new concept after so many years at the old one.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went into nursing school all we had to do was take the entrance<br/>\nexams.  They were based on 10th grade knowledge and was mostly reading and<br/>\nmath.  Very easy to pass.  I had already graduated from high school and<br/>\ntaken college courses in english, math and history but I had been majoring<br/>\nin music.  It would not have mattered if I had not gotten the diploma or<br/>\ntaken any courses as long as I passed that test.  They only needed to see<br/>\nthat you would be able to get all the reading done ( I am sure you know how<br/>\nmany tons of reading that was so your speed and comprehension had to be<br/>\nup ).  The math you had to know only basic math and be able to learn to do<br/>\ndrug formula conversions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is just full speed ahead and hope to do our best.<br/>\n       .·:*´¨`*:·..·:*´¨`*:·.<br/>\n       *: *   Sharon   * *<br/>\n         *·.             .·*<br/>\n              `*·-:¦:-*´<br/>\n           ³´`*:»§«:*´`³<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Bonni Sollars&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BSOLLARS@...\">BSOLLARS@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 16, 2002 9:57 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: college?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sharon, I wondered about homeschooling my children because I knew in high<br/>\n&gt; school they teach accredited classes to graduate and get into college.<br/>\n&gt; So I actually looked at the college literature to see if it mattered.<br/>\n&gt; First of all, the community college does not require a high school<br/>\n&gt; diploma or ged to get in.  All we need to do is to take whatever classes<br/>\n&gt; we want, take an exam, talk to a counselor about what major we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; interested in.  If we want to be in a specific program, then we need to<br/>\n&gt; meet certain requirements.  But they show us what these are and how to<br/>\n&gt; meet them.  Then, the other thing is, when I went for a nursing course<br/>\n&gt; several years ago, I found that all the college level courses I took in<br/>\n&gt; high school meant nothing because after five years those credits don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; count.  (So much for girls who take a break to bear children.)  Even if I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t do great on their exam, or don&#39;t meet their requirements, they show<br/>\n&gt; how to get these things.   I looked into film production, and<br/>\n&gt; engineering, since those are what my two oldest are interested in.  Boy<br/>\n&gt; was I surprised that they did not even need a diploma to become these<br/>\n&gt; things.  I looked into the local colleges, and they take homeschooled<br/>\n&gt; kids, they just want paperwork demonstrating or describing what sort of<br/>\n&gt; things they&#39;ve learned.  In my area, home schooled kids are required to<br/>\n&gt; take an exam every three years to prove they are learning.  My oldest<br/>\n&gt; needs to take it every year to stay in sports.  He wants to get his ged<br/>\n&gt; as soon as it is legal, and to start at the local community college as<br/>\n&gt; soon as possible to become an architectural engineer.  He plans to finish<br/>\n&gt; two years locally, then finish his degree at a school about 30 miles<br/>\n&gt; away.  (I think of this as locally, but around here everything is so<br/>\n&gt; close that 10 miles seems &quot;too far to drive&quot; to most people-haha:).  He<br/>\n&gt; is already saving up for college, and we are looking into scholarship<br/>\n&gt; opportunities.<br/>\n&gt; My oldest sister dropped out of school in the ninth grade and worked<br/>\n&gt; three jobs to get a place out in the middle of nowhere (rural Oklahoma)<br/>\n&gt; when she was 21 where she lived with her first husband who was also a<br/>\n&gt; school drop out but made his living as an organic farmer and mechanic.<br/>\n&gt; During this time she worked at a health food coop where she learned a lot<br/>\n&gt; about natural health. They divorced.  She got massages from a customer,<br/>\n&gt; who taught massage therapy at the community college.  At age 32, she got<br/>\n&gt; her ged, which involved the dreaded algebra, became a massage therapist<br/>\n&gt; and met her present husband in the same class.  The two of them and his<br/>\n&gt; friend opened the first massage therapy clinic in Fort Smith Arkansas<br/>\n&gt; when she was 33.  They are verrrry successful.  More than I am.  They<br/>\n&gt; will retire five years from now, when she is 46.<br/>\n&gt; I graduated from high school and never got into partying and skipping<br/>\n&gt; school.  I was on honor roll and had an A- average.  Whoopdedoo.  It<br/>\n&gt; means nothing after five years.  My point being that you don&#39;t need to<br/>\n&gt; have some sort of special credits, etc. to go to college and get degrees.<br/>\n&gt;  You just find out what the school of your choice requires and endeavor<br/>\n&gt; to meet those requirements.  My thinking is that if you don&#39;t do well on<br/>\n&gt; their entrance exam, then take local community college courses, or buy<br/>\n&gt; their books and study them at home, and then take the exam again.  It all<br/>\n&gt; depends on how much passion and enthusiasm there is for the subject area.<br/>\n&gt;  Where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way.<br/>\n&gt; Oh, I should mention correspondence schools.  I know a woman who never<br/>\n&gt; graduated from high school, but went to work in doctors offices at a<br/>\n&gt; young age before you needed all the certificates.  At 50 something, she<br/>\n&gt; began to take a correspondence course to become a nurse while working<br/>\n&gt; days for the doctor.  She had to miss work occasionally to go to the<br/>\n&gt; local community college for certain classes, but not too much.  Five<br/>\n&gt; years and a lot of books later, she took her nursing test and is a<br/>\n&gt; licensed registered nurse.<br/>\n&gt; Sorry if this is long, there are others who know more than I do about all<br/>\n&gt; this.
