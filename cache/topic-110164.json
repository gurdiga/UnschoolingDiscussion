I don&#39;t know why I do it or maybe again I <br/>\ndo.  If I am honest it is because I long for a closeness that will <br/>\nnever be there.  My father will never be the Daddy I wanted and felt <br/>\nI needed him to be.  Now, I am 33 and not so needy anymore and I <br/>\nguess that is why I am less likely to continue trying to nurture a <br/>\nmiserable relationship.  If I have to live my life to his standards <br/>\nand ideals in order to make him like/love me...it just ain&#39;t gonna <br/>\nhappen any more.  It still makes me sad that I never will have that <br/>\ncloseness that children should have with their parents, but I guess <br/>\nit is time to get over it and go on with my life and let my children <br/>\nlive in peace without placing the same eggshells in their lives.

I am at this time <br/>\nconsidering her idea of writing things down from this incident.  I <br/>\nam trying to see the visit and each incident from their point of <br/>\nview to try and understand why things happened but am struggling <br/>\nwith it a bit well more like a lot.  My father called and tried to <br/>\nfeel me out the night I got home but I just wasn&#39;t emotionally ready <br/>\nto talk to him about it.  I didn&#39;t want to say things I would regret <br/>\nand/or leave things that were important out of the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think writing all of what I can remember down, how I felt and how <br/>\nthe children and my husband conveyed they felt is a very good idea.  <br/>\nSo when it is discussed (probably soon) I will be less likely to <br/>\nleave things out.  It will probably help me to not be quite so <br/>\nemotional and more matter of fact.  I tend to get panicky and shakey <br/>\nduring confrontation then I forget half of what I wanted to say.  I <br/>\njust want everyone to be happy and it just doesn&#39;t seem to work out <br/>\nthat way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy father is the type of person that when he gets angry with you he <br/>\nholds a grudge and will go years without speaking to you.  I watched <br/>\nhim go 7 years without speaking to my brother then things seemed to <br/>\nresolve until he got mad about something else and now it has been <br/>\nalmost 5 years again since he spoke to my brother. Honestly I am not <br/>\nso sure that it is my father, but his wife that causes these rifts <br/>\nto be more than they should be. Who knows, regardless it is <br/>\nridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is too short to be pissed off and nasty to people over things <br/>\nthat are of no consequence to you.  For instance who cares what my <br/>\nkids eat as long as they are healthy.  Is it something to freak out <br/>\nover and cause a rift in a relationship (make your grandchildren <br/>\nnever want to see you)?  I don&#39;t think so, but it seems to me that I <br/>\nam the only person on my side of the family that feels this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husbands family is very verbal.  If you make them mad they tell <br/>\nyou and then it is over.  Never holding grudges there!!!

However, once again with Franki we had a problem.  She <br/>\napparently (according to dh)kind of coerced Franki in to putting <br/>\ngreen beans on her plate, along with fruit salad, mac and cheese and <br/>\nturkey.  Well, I walked over to the table just in time to hear her <br/>\ntell Franki that she couldn&#39;t have any more candy that night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her if it was because Franki hadn&#39;t eaten the green beans <br/>\n(with bacon and almonds in them) and she said yes that all she eats <br/>\nis candy.  I said that it wasn&#39;t true pointing that the green beans <br/>\nwere the only things she hadn&#39;t eaten and that the rest of her plate <br/>\nwas clean.  Well that didn&#39;t go over well either.  I ended up giving <br/>\nFranki snacks out of the car when she got hungry later.  All the <br/>\nother kids also politely refused candy when offered to them.  They <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like the way Franki was treated!

There are other situations that can be abusive too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the summer I was a camp nurse in another state.  There was only one other nurse there and she had been there for a couple of weeks before me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first things seemed ok, but after the first week it became apparent that all was not right with her. And there were others there that knew her (they were the ones who encouraged her to come and take the job) and would hint to me that she was taking advantage of me.  That in and of itself didn&#39;t bother me though.  I can do anything for 2 weeks.  I had 2 days off/week and I was getting paid.  Thats the best camp situation I&#39;ve ever had!!  I didn&#39;t mind if she felt the need to take advantage.  She&#39;d been the sole nurse for a couple of weeks before I got there, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately it went way beyond that.  She was very lax and told me she signed meds off whether she gave them or not (these are psychotropic drugs and/or controlled substances like Ritalin).  She wasn&#39;t &quot;withholding meds&quot; for any noble purpose.  She was either just sloppy in her work or she was skimming the meds for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also told me she was using expensive medication from a counselor to give to her daughter because she &quot;couldn&#39;t afford&quot; to take her daughter to the doctor.  But she never told the counselor about it or asked if it was ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would tell me that both of us could take off the same day and let the nurse practitioner handle things the two days that the np was there.  It didn&#39;t feel right but she&#39;d been there longer than me so I said ok the first time, and asked her to call the NP the second time to make sure it was ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then one night she got nasty with me because I had correctly diagnosed a child with pneumonia (sent him to the doctor and it was confirmed) after she insisted she listens to lungs all the time and that his lungs were clear.  Later that evening she got nasty again when I gave her daughter a higher than usual dose of tylenol (it was a high dose, but one time wouldn&#39;t hurt anything).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was just a gut feeling, but over the years my gut instincts have evolved to be very accurate.  I went to the director and told her what was going on...all of it. She mentioned she thought it was odd that we were both taking the same days off and leaving the np to work alone and I explained that I felt like I was being &quot;set up&quot; to take some sort of fall for something.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe director wanted me to stay but I just knew that something really really bad would happen if I did.  This nurse kept her bedroom door locked (I couldn&#39;t lock mine).  And she said things to me that indicated that she had gone through my personal belongings.  This along with all of the above set off red flags that my nursing license might be in jeopardy unless I left.  And I was starting to feel like this woman was capable of just about anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe director wanted me to stay until morning but I could leave early if I wanted to.  I started packing at 11:30 that night and left at 2am. Fortunately my kids were ready to leave too.  They were fed up with some of the other aspects of the camp. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t regret leaving.  I do truly regret that it didn&#39;t work out.  I really enjoyed that camp, the counselors, and the kids.  But there are other camps and other kids and other nurses who aren&#39;t whack jobs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, November 26, 2005 2:58 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: working parents; was missing unschooled teen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 11/26/05 12:49:00 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janddplus5@...\">janddplus5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -=-Before she even got drunk she was really nasty to my kids.

However, Sandra you are more right than you could <br/>\never know about these behaviors.  I was raised in a sexually abusive <br/>\nsituation and lived with my stepfather who was exactly like this.  <br/>\nTherefor most people never believed my stories and I lived in that <br/>\nsituation with no help until I turned 16 and I ran away and never <br/>\nwent back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as my stepmother, she is a 64 year old drunk.  I have never <br/>\nseen her quite as bad as I did this Thursday.  My father had to <br/>\ncarry her to bed because she was so trashed.  She almost lit her <br/>\nface and hair on fire trying to light a cigarette.  Then she got up <br/>\nfrom bed because she said the t.v. was too loud and my kids were <br/>\nbothering her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy father immediately jumped up and ran for her before she fell over <br/>\non one of my kids (it happened really fast)who were laying on an air <br/>\nmattress in the living room.  Then she proceeded to fight with him <br/>\nover the remote.  It was just awful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she even got drunk she was really nasty to my kids.  She was <br/>\npissed at me for not forcing them to go to bed.  At my house there <br/>\nreally isn&#39;t a bedtime rule and so they are not used to being forced <br/>\nto go to sleep.  It&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t laying down and they <br/>\nweren&#39;t talking loud or bothering anyone.  She told them that it was <br/>\nadult time and they needed to go to bed.  Whatever!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 year old Franki, who my s-mother particularly picked on while <br/>\nwere there wanted to leave in the middle of the night.  I packed up <br/>\nyesterday morning and can&#39;t imagine ever going back.  Why?, it&#39;s not <br/>\nlike any of us enjoyed our visit.  All my children detest her and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t blame them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all the mean and nasty things she said to Franki, she wanted <br/>\nher to give her a kiss and told her how much she loves her.  <br/>\nBullshit!!!  I didn&#39;t make her kiss her -- I wouldn&#39;t have kissed <br/>\nher big fat drunk lips YUCK!!!  Besides I felt it was just a way to <br/>\nmanipulate my child.  Treat her like crap and then tell her how much <br/>\nshe means to you!?!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole visit sucked and I have no intentions of repeating it.  No <br/>\none protected me from my life of horror...but I will not ever <br/>\nintentionally place my children in a position for them to be <br/>\nphysically or mentally (which is just as bad in my book).   She made <br/>\na choice to behave that way, my father made a choice to let it <br/>\nhappen, I am making a choice to never let it happen again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just upset with myself that I even thought that maybe this time <br/>\nthings would be different.  She has said some pretty rude things in <br/>\nthe past and I have tried to fanagle situations so that my kids are <br/>\nnever alone with my parents.  Well even though that has been <br/>\nsuccessful, she has now taken to behaving this way even in front of <br/>\nmy husband and children.  NO MORE for my kids...no big loss for them <br/>\nthey never liked her anyway cause she always yelled at them about <br/>\neverything.  They couldn&#39;t ever do anything right!  No more grief <br/>\nfor me or my husband either.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much more but too hard to write...<br/>\n<br/>\nDana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: working parents; was missing unschooled teen","postDate":"1133028160","msgId":110200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI5NS4zZDk3N2UuMzBiOWZkNDBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110196,"nextInTopic":110204,"prevInTime":110199,"nextInTime":110201,"topicId":110164,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I knew I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t give 100% to being a parent if I wasn&#39;t there to do it. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I understand what you&#39;re saying, and I am a BIG advocate of <br/>\nparents being with their children, some of us feel that a career <br/>\ntrack AND being a parent is the best choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranted, my career is extremely flexible (I wouldn&#39;t want to work if <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t make family life the center), I work short hours and make <br/>\ngood money, and mostly work the hours I want, but I CHOOSE to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that my work has been a positive thing in all of our lives. <br/>\nMy children have benefited, it&#39;s been a shared interest with Sierra <br/>\nand I get to do something I&#39;m passionate about. I also get to meet <br/>\nsome really interesting people and dip my toe into many different <br/>\nworlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO feel I give 100% to being a parent because I am really THERE <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m with my kids. The times I&#39;m gone, they have Dad and I know <br/>\nthey&#39;re not only safe, but having a good time for the most part. He <br/>\nisn&#39;t as big into messy stuff, but they know this and end up <br/>\nwatching movies with him, or wrestling or playing games.  There have <br/>\nbeen only a few times over the last few years that I really felt I <br/>\nwas gone more than I wanted to be. And it was short lived (for a <br/>\nweek, or a day).<br/>\nI CHOOSE to be a working parent, and I feel it&#39;s a good choice for <br/>\nmy family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109995,"nextTopicId":110113}}
