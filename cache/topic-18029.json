How the<br/>\nbeauracracy of it all is nonsensical. How litte<br/>\nlearning goes on. How frustrating it feels to be an<br/>\nunderpaid babysitter of far too many kids at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, when you decide to become a teacher, you&#39;re<br/>\nusually very idealistic. You want to help youth. You<br/>\nusually have an altruistic, nurturing spirit. You know<br/>\nthat you&#39;ll be the best teacher ever. Then you get<br/>\nthere, and you see the sadness of the<br/>\nabused/neglected/traumatized kids, you see how the<br/>\nsystem doesn&#39;t work for any of them, you learn that<br/>\nlife in a public school is like one giant Dilbert<br/>\ncomic. But  many stay. Not because they believe in the<br/>\nsystem. They stay because they STILL love kids, and<br/>\nthey want to be there for them even though it means<br/>\nfighting a losing battle. To leave, for them, would<br/>\nmean giving up on those kids they love. They learn to<br/>\ncome home and cry rather than bang their heads against<br/>\nthe wall in front of the students.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could talk about this all day, but I already used<br/>\nfar more than my fair share of your attention with my<br/>\nstory about my daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nJuli, who has hundreds of public school horror stories<br/>\nif you&#39;re ever in the mood to hear a few.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
