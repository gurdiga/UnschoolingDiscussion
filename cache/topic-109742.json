My middle child - she&#39;s 18 now and suddenly seems very capable -  <br/>\nbut I remember when, at 13 or 14, I realized she couldn&#39;t use a can  <br/>\nopener. There were always things she had trouble with - that seemed  <br/>\nvery out of line with her intellect and even with her own  <br/>\nintrospective abilities.  She told me the other day that she still  <br/>\nhas trouble picking up social clues from people. Her example is that  <br/>\nshe&#39;s hanging around the college theater where she does shows, with a  <br/>\ngroup of other people, and some are talking about going out to eat.  <br/>\nShe never used to know if she was &quot;invited&quot; or not. It would be one  <br/>\nof those things where everybody was arranging rides and stuff, and  <br/>\nunless someone looked right at HER and asked, &quot;Do you want to ride  <br/>\nwith me?&quot; she&#39;d think she shouldn&#39;t go.  Now she gets it that  <br/>\neverybody is &#39;invited&quot; - that it is just a group thing and she can  <br/>\njust ask somebody, &quot;Do you have room for me to ride with you?&quot; But  <br/>\nshe said, a couple of days ago, that she&#39;s starting to realize how  <br/>\nmuch social stuff just went over her head, in the past, and she  <br/>\nthinks it still does. &quot;I&quot; think that her interpersonal intelligence  <br/>\nis developing and she&#39;s becoming more aware and competent - so at the  <br/>\nsame time that she&#39;s actually MORE competent, she&#39;s more aware of her  <br/>\nincompetence. She&#39;d definitely happier, though, and enjoying  <br/>\nobserving other people and thinking about how they interact with each  <br/>\nother and what it all means. Seems to me most girls, at least, do a  <br/>\nlot of this in their young teens, but my daughter didn&#39;t seem to have  <br/>\nan eye for it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer &quot;intelligences&quot; have been extreme and very uneven since she was  <br/>\nvery very little - I think she&#39;s a kid whose brain develops that way  <br/>\n- huge big massive development in certain areas - she read fluently  <br/>\nat three years old and was reading adult-level literature at five,  <br/>\nfor example. Socially, she had a lot of trouble - never was good at  <br/>\nreading other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - my point is that she certainly never fit into any box and it  <br/>\nwas amazing how many people blamed her for that and blamed ME for  <br/>\ntrying to make her life a bit easier (at the same time that I was, of  <br/>\nCOURSE, supporting her learning to handle herself better, especially  <br/>\nin groups).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling is an absolute blessing for our family.

The comment from the one person was a <br/>\nquote, but I get many on how well behaved my kids are.  Well it is <br/>\nnot that they are not well behaved now, but alot of the reason my <br/>\nchildren &quot;were&quot; so well behaved is because we lived an almost cult-<br/>\nlike Christian lifestyle.(whole &#39;nother topic)  My children weren&#39;t <br/>\nallowed to misbehave (ever)which meant...<br/>\n1. never having an opinion that didn&#39;t match ours (dh and I)<br/>\n2. never had a choice or other option other than what we dictated to <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n3. not having an opinion or a choice means being quiet and agreeable <br/>\nfor the most part.<br/>\n4. My children were so sheltered that they had no idea what <br/>\nrebelling even was (or at least the younger ones)<br/>\n5. The sad and sorry list goes on and on...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know your situation is different but for my family having perfect <br/>\nand obedient children came at a great price to those children.  One <br/>\nthat I will spend the remainder of my days trying to mend and erase <br/>\nfrom their memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my kids are amazing when they are good and equally as amazing <br/>\nwhen they are naughty(antagonizing each other).  They voice their <br/>\nopinion now and we struggle through and remind ourselves when they <br/>\nare hard to deal with that it is because of what we did to them. <br/>\n(not your case I am sure, but it is mine).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have really great runs where for a couple weeks their behavior <br/>\nand actions are mild and wonderful to live with and then we will <br/>\nhave (like last week) a couple days in a row where it is very <br/>\nfrustrating.  My dh wanted to throw in the towel due to this last <br/>\nweek, but I reminded him that you can&#39;t turn around a lifetime of <br/>\nmistakes, and expect to have no bumps in the road, overnight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest problem is helping them to find an acceptable way to <br/>\nexpress anger and frustration. A way that isn&#39;t hurtful or harmful <br/>\nto other members of the family.  This is not easy cause my kids have <br/>\nnever been allowed to express themselves.  It&#39;s like starting from <br/>\nthe beginning, only with a new baby they don&#39;t have the years of <br/>\noppression to hamper thier learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  She has difficulties with some social and other situations and <br/>\n&gt; other people do not understand (or want to undertand) that she has <br/>\n&gt; the unacceptable behaviour at that time because she can&#39;t cope or <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; very stressed.

Others who <br/>\njust don&#39;t have the time to keep up with what ps does since it <br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t affect what I am doing with my kids.  I also find it <br/>\ntoo depressing.

Esp. when I am not trying to tell them <br/>\nthey have to do it my way!!!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, I keep up with the progressive private school goings-on, so that&#39;s why I was SOOOO taken aback by what I found on Michael&#39;s site. I really thought the schools were trying (&#39;though failing miserably!) to be better. I thought they were putting out *some* kind of effort to make schools a better place to be and to move into the 21st century. Hell, there are new schools and school buildings going up here every month! We have &quot;Speaking of Schools&quot; on NPR (and although I hardly ever agree with them, they seem to be *trying*). There are reports almost weekly on the local news about changes they want to see. The Superintendent of Education is *highly* visible and in the news almost daily----but then again, she wants to be governor---and test the hell out of kids!<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I guess I was wrong. Or deluded. Or sheltered. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I have rude awakenings every now and then: We had two convicts escape a couple of weeks ago. All the area schools were in lock-down. No one in or out. Our 12 year old neighbor said that they weren&#39;t even allowed to go to the bathroom all day---just allowed to change classes. One girl had diarrhea. Eleven years old.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe also have a &quot;Reading First&quot; elementary school---it&#39;s where Duncan is zoned. What the HELL does that *mean*, anyway???<br/>\n <br/>\nBut to answer your question... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have no faith that someone who doesn&#39;t know me OR my children will know what they need to know. I *DO* know that Cameron&#39;s friends are having a really hard time in high school now---and I&#39;m NOT talking academically: they&#39;re all &quot;passing&quot; their classes. They&#39;re having a hard time emotionally, spiritually (not Christian-based---but in their own hearts---the &quot;breath&quot; part of spiritual), socially, economically---not to mention relationship-wise with their families and with the world. They have no direction. No passions. NOTHING. They&#39;re empty.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy unschooled teen is RICH with ALL those things. I have all the proof *I* need. I usually just wave my hand and say that the proof is in the pudding.

Others who <br/>\njust don&#39;t have the time to keep up with what ps does since it <br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t affect what I am doing with my kids.  I also find it <br/>\ntoo depressing.
