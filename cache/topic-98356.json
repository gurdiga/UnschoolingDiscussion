She may not let you come back if you aren’t<br/>\ndoing  what she says.”  I HATE FEELING AN OBLIGATION TO SAY THIS KIND  OF<br/>\nSTUFF. To be honest I think she is so happy to have a break, that all  that<br/>\nwould happen is that she would just give them a longer lecture  standing by<br/>\nmy front door in my presence, about all her rules, and the  little amount of<br/>\nleeway they have would be lost. (It is too much to hope  for that they would<br/>\nnever come back.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI let the kids do what they want, but if I know it will be an issue I ask  <br/>\nthem what their mother will think.  I don&#39;t make any promises that I will  keep <br/>\nit a secret--in fact I&#39;m going to display for the mother that I trust her  <br/>\nkids as much as I trust my own.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe don&#39;t have any M rated games here, since Jon moved out.  But I did  check <br/>\nwith a 9 yo kid the other day when he wanted to play a T game.  I  asked if he <br/>\nusually plays T rated games at home.  He said his mother didn&#39;t  mind.  It&#39;s <br/>\nnot up to me to enforce their rules, but it&#39;s kind of me to  help the kid <br/>\nremember that there maybe consequences at home for the choices he  makes while <br/>\nhe&#39;s here.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m really going to pass the buck to the kid to make the decision.  I  mean, <br/>\nhow can I display that I trust the kid if I don&#39;t give him an opportunity  to <br/>\nchoose based on what he knows?  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf their parent asks me to keep them from playing T rated games, I&#39;m likely  <br/>\nto say something to the crowd to indicate the parent&#39;s preference.  But I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot going to enforce it.  I&#39;m going to let them choose.  I&#39;m not the  hall <br/>\nmonitor around here.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe little girl Renee is displaying a deep need to have enough, I  think.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s empty.  I know Jayn is probably too young to get this,  but I&#39;d explain it <br/>\nto my son, and he would likely give her everything she wants  until she gets <br/>\nat least partly filled up.  I think pretty soon that she  would see that <br/>\nyou&#39;re not going to withhold anything, she won&#39;t want anything  else.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the restaurant I&#39;d say, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Jayn will share all the fries she  <br/>\nwants!&quot;  If the other parent still objects, on the basis of good food vs.  bad, I <br/>\nthink I&#39;d call the waitress over and order my girl a sundae just to make  the <br/>\npoint.  But that&#39;s just me.  lol.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":98339,"nextTopicId":98337}}
