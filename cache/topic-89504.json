No one is without the capacity to sin in this world.  No one <br/>\ncan get to the Father except through the Son and a personal relationship with <br/>\nGod.  No amount of works or &quot;being good&quot; will get you there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso no amount of any sin will keep you out once you&#39;ve been saved, but other <br/>\nreligions reject that idea too of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it just like no amount of cajoling or forcing or any amount of sitting <br/>\nin a classroom can guarantee real learning?   Everyone (almost) has the <br/>\ncapacity to learn, but it can&#39;t be forced and result in a joy filled life long <br/>\nlearning environment.   It needs to be on a person&#39;s own personal terms, just like <br/>\nwith unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the real question, if you feel your child must be SAVED to go to Heaven is <br/>\ntrue then how can you NOT be constantly concerned about their eternity at the <br/>\nexpense of allowing them the freedom of living and learning?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that salvation is essential to seeing Heaven.  I also have faith <br/>\nthat my children will find this on their own, in their own way, not necessarily <br/>\nMY way.

I interpret it clearly to say that it is by FAITH not works that <br/>\none is saved.  I can do NOTHING to make my children be &quot;saved&quot;.  I also read <br/>\nthat my God is a loving God and wants the best for his &quot;children&quot;.  I want the <br/>\nbest for my children.  I read that my God gives us freewill to choose.  I <br/>\ngive my children freewill to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do read the part in Revelations about the last days and the coming of <br/>\nChrist, and I do believe it.  I also believe in a literal heaven and hell.  I also <br/>\nhave faith that my children will find their way to a loving God on many paths, <br/>\nor maybe in the solitude of their hearts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is not my &quot;job&quot; to give my children eternal salvation, that is only <br/>\nthrough their own personal experience and their own relationship with God <br/>\nthat it can be found.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very parallel walk with unschooling in my mind.  I model behaviours <br/>\nfor my children, that is what they see/hear/know.  They have freewill to make <br/>\ntheir own choice about EVERYTHING in life.  Does it mean I will be THRILLED with <br/>\nevery decision they make?  Not at all, but it also do not mean I will cast <br/>\nthem out of my life for things I personally do not believe or agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally aren&#39;t both things we are discussing, religion and unschooling about <br/>\nFAITH?  Faith that our children will learn what they need to learn, when they <br/>\nneed to learn it.  Faith that our children will find the path to journey <br/>\nthrough life that is right for THEM.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it as very similar, not at all opposites, one seems to naturally <br/>\ncompliment the other, in my life anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of what is &quot;thought&quot; to be in the name of one religion or another is <br/>\njust someone&#39;s fanatical skewed views of something. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake these terrorist acts in the name of a jihad. True believers and <br/>\nworshippers of Muslim will say they are against violence and these acts are wrong.  <br/>\nYet they are very visible and very public so it gives the impression of that <br/>\nreligion being like we see it on our T.V&#39;s which isn&#39;t necessarily a true <br/>\nrepresentation of the Muslim religion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4324016,"authorName":"Kelly Lenhart","from":"&quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;mina@...&gt;","profile":"mommamina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: WItchcraft type play was: spectrum kids, rage...","postDate":"1074650377","msgId":89593,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBmZWMwMWMzZGZjMiQzOTdmMjgzMCRmZDAwYThjMEBKZW5ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PGJ1anJqaSs5ODNrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":89592,"nextInTopic":89605,"prevInTime":89592,"nextInTime":89594,"topicId":89504,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
