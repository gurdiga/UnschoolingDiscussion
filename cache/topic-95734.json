Since <br/>\nmy mom&#39;s birthday was a 50&#39;s-era theme, I made the poster like a <br/>\ngiant neon clock and across the top in neon-ish letters, I <br/>\nwrote &quot;Rock Around the Clock with Marsha&quot;, then arranged the photos <br/>\nchronologically around the clock. It was one of the biggest hits of <br/>\nthe party to see all the photos from her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you can go to this website: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thisdayinmusic.com/cont/choose.html\">http://www.thisdayinmusic.com/cont/choose.html</a><br/>\nand find out what the number one song was on the day he was born. <br/>\nAlso maybe search the days/weeks around there and compile a tape of <br/>\nthe music? Or a tape of his current favorite songs? Have a video <br/>\ncompilation done of him (you can transfer old home movies to video at <br/>\nmany camera stores), or a computer running a screensaver of photos? I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s fun for people who know a person in one facet to see all <br/>\nthe different sides of them, and photos/music/video are good ways to <br/>\ndo that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166495566,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"&quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot; &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"OT:  50th birthday ideas please??","postDate":"1087164225","msgId":95734,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWM0NTE5MiQ0Y2RiNmJlMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":95775,"prevInTime":95733,"nextInTime":95735,"topicId":95734,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope its ok for me to send this to you guys.

Then we&#39;ll have each person read their memories out loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll take pictures and scrapbook the pictures and the memories.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I figure everyone can take care of their own socializing etc.  It will be BYOB.  Its supposed to be an outdoor party, unless it rains.  I think for decorations I&#39;ll stick to black balloons and crepe paper with some candles.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else have any other ideas to add to this?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95761,"nextTopicId":95778}}
