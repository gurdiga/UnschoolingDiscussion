But absolutely impossible! I can&#39;t sing/play an instrument worth beans <br/>\n(although I do sing---and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s horribly out of tune). And no way to <br/>\ncheck because I&#39;m NOT going to sing solo for you! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, the musical intelligence requirement is a no go. Ben and I like <br/>\nmusic--many sorts. And the children HEAR a lot. Cameron has played with a lot <br/>\nof instruments---even wants a set of drums for Christmas. We have several <br/>\nharmonicas, a tiny violin, an acoustic and an electric guitar, two keyboards, <br/>\nbongos, and maybe a few other things---but nothing (other than the CD player) <br/>\ngets played except for occasionally the bongos quietly at night and the <br/>\nkeyboards every now and then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s no way the musical intelligence is an indication! We&#39;re living proof! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how about animal lovers as a possible requirement for unschooling? Seems <br/>\nas if there are quite a few here. BUT there are also some unschoolers who <br/>\nwould NEVER have a pet in the house. Them I just would not associate with!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49853,"nextTopicId":49866}}
