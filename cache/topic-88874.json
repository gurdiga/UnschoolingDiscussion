Most of the stuff they did could much more easily been accomplished at home in an environment where the child is getting more adult attention. Some of the equipment they used was really cool, right/left brain type stuff....but it is all available to anyone that wants to purchase it! And a creative parent could find more affordable alternatives.<br/>\nI went to speech therapy in school..what a joke.<br/>\nParents are usually the best source of help for a child with special needs,especially in the unschooling environment.<br/>\nTherapy, if needed, can be provided at home. Truly.<br/>\nThere are going to be rare cases where a parent needs to get some help. But it all depends. For the things I&#39;ve read about here, I think the parent could do a better job with less invasion of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88861,"nextTopicId":88875}}
