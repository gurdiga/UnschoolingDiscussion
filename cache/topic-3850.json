Two of us line up at one end of a &quot;lane&quot; far enough away to<br/>\nmake it last a bit but close enough so we do not have to shout.  Then each<br/>\nof us ask our team mate a multiplication question.  When they answer<br/>\ncorrectly, they take a giant step forward and ask the other person a<br/>\nmultiplication question.  And you get the idea.  The best way to encourage<br/>\nan activity is to make it fun and to have immediate, positive reinforcement<br/>\nat each step if possible, and at the end of the activity.  Our reinforcement<br/>\ncomes in the form of support and fun during the activity and then the<br/>\nchildren can choose there favorite play activity for me and / or my wife to<br/>\nparticipate with them in.  They love the interactive fun and the fact that<br/>\nwe participate with in the math part.  You should just seem their self<br/>\ndirected study when they know we are going to the park the net day to play<br/>\nthe game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrow Daddy in the Pool Math can be used with any math and we use it for<br/>\nareas that are practical that they are having trouble on.  Sometimes they<br/>\nwill have trouble getting 6 * 4 or some similar problem.  We remember this<br/>\nand when we take a swim I will spontaneously ask them the problem.  If they<br/>\nget it right, they get to push me in the pool.  (Sometimes I think they<br/>\nsandbag :-)  They keep asking eagerly, &quot;Daddy ask me my math!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a couple of examples we have used.  But guess what... they<br/>\nnail their math tables!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for asking - RJS</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Campbell & Wyman","from":"Campbell & Wyman &lt;brynlee@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nUoGpkiYYiLfjnq9JKqohUrgusQV-tb5gjGUqXMbKDFT_l1XSa2PWE5kOqPL51oROZcHsJ-jZwaKvF497n2E6rxOtCnIGEGMGp1yNLJ3Kfa1","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Memorization ...","postDate":"939927809","msgId":3850,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNTUuMzg1MC45NTkyNjk3NDNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3851,"prevInTime":3849,"nextInTime":3851,"topicId":3850,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
