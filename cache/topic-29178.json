It tends to be a<br/>\nsore spot because people keep gasping that my 8yo doesn&#39;t read fluently.  So<br/>\nI have some thoughts to throw out.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not dribble a basketball well.  I have tried and tried but I don&#39;t do<br/>\nit well.  My guess would be that if you did some type of neuro mapping of me<br/>\ndribbling and Michael Jordan, or even a kid on the local basketball team,<br/>\ndribbling, our mapping would look considerably different.  Does that mean<br/>\nthat there is some neurological cause for my inability to dribble well?  Do<br/>\nI have Dys-bounce-ia?  And if there is a core neurological difference, is<br/>\nthat a difference or a disability?  Where do we draw the line between normal<br/>\nvariation and anomaly?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, most things fall along a bell-shaped, normal distribution curve.<br/>\nHeight does, weight does, intelligence does, dribbling ability does.  I<br/>\nwould tend to guess that reading ability, mathematics ability, etc. also<br/>\nfall along a bell curve.  Is it possible that LD people are simply the<br/>\nbottom end of the bell curve on that particular skill?  We don&#39;t say that<br/>\nshort people are Growing Disabled, or that poor dribblers are Bouncing<br/>\nDisabled, why do we say poor readers are Learning Disabled?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs disability, something being &quot;wrong&quot; with you, determined by how much that<br/>\nability is favored or utilized by the society in which you live?  Were there<br/>\nLearning Disabled people 500 years ago or simply people on the low end of<br/>\nthe bell curve, people for whom a skill was more difficult?  If the society<br/>\nin which you live determines whether or not you are &quot;disabled&quot;, is the<br/>\ndiagnosis a reflection of you or of your society?  If it is a reflection of<br/>\nyour society, can it truly be considered a diagnosis at all?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
