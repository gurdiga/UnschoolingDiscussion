Since my kids complain that we don&#39;t get to our afternoon activities soon <br/>\nenough and they stand around asking me over and over if I&#39;m done with the <br/>\nstuff I need to do yet, I have told them that we are a team and if they want to <br/>\nget somewhere by 1pm instead of 2pm then they need to help me clean up. <br/>\nDoes this go against the idea of not asking kids to do chores?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. quoting from the website: &quot;It&#39;s more of a shift in the parent&#39;s attitude than the <br/>\nkids at first. If a person appears grumpy about cleaning, the kids will pick up <br/>\non that and immediately assume that cleaning is a real bummer.&quot;<br/>\nWhat if you really do feel like cleaning is a bummer? What if you are one of <br/>\nthose people who are genetically not into cleaning? (quoting: &quot; studies of <br/>\nseparated identical twins suggest that the desire and ability to clean and <br/>\norganize have more to do with genetics than &quot;training.&quot;&quot;)<br/>\nCertainly &quot;faking it&quot; won&#39;t work, the kids will see right through that!<br/>\n<br/>\n3. My kids have never had chores, but I do get on their cases for not cleaning <br/>\nup their messes. I want to stop, so this is why I am reading the website and <br/>\nasking these questions. Here is what happens in our house. My husband <br/>\ndoes the dishes, the laundry and the some of the cleaning (like sweeping, <br/>\nmoping etc...) When I do clean, it&#39;s &quot;spring cleaning&quot; type of stuff, like 8 hours <br/>\nstraight of cleaning in one day 2 or 3 times a year, moving all the furniture <br/>\naround etc...Part of why I don&#39;t clean more often is that once I get started, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to stop, so I rarely do it, because with kids around, there are always <br/>\ninteruptions, for stuff they need from me, so I wait until a day when I am alone <br/>\nat home. Anyway, the problem is that my husband gets really tired of a messy <br/>\nhouse, but he makes it clear to us all that he doesn&#39;t want to be the one to <br/>\nclean everything. Also, he is mortified if we have anyone over to our house <br/>\nand they see how messy our house is. How do I remedy this? I am NOT under <br/>\nthe ilusion that I can &quot;fix&quot; my husband. What can I do to change MY attitude <br/>\ntoward cleaning?<br/>\n(I have sent him a link to Sandra&#39;s page on cleaning before, whether he read <br/>\nit or not I don&#39;t know!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. When I do everything my kids ask of me I feel overwhelmed. I just can&#39;t fit it <br/>\nall in one day. I also get a reaction from where, I don&#39;t know, but it is a strong <br/>\nfeeling of being their servant and I just want to scream at them! Especially if <br/>\nthey TELL me what they want or need as opposed to &quot;asking me&quot; (like &quot;Mom, <br/>\nget me an apple&quot;) I don&#39;t require them to say thank you or please, but <br/>\noccasionally I let them know that it is a lot easier to do things for them if they <br/>\ninclude these or if they at least ask rather than demand. Is this reasonable or <br/>\nam I just deluding myself? <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp please!<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nDenise</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108972,"nextTopicId":108971}}
