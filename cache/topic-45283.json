Jesus specifically prayed against the human weakness for <br/>\nremoval (John 17:15). And His prayer is still in effect. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following quotes confirm that Jesus deliberately lead his followers into <br/>\nfalse expectations.<br/>\nMatthew 10:23 - When giving instructions to his apostles as to just how they <br/>\nare to go about spreading his message Jesus says, .&quot; . . for truly I say unto <br/>\nyou, you shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of <br/>\nMan comes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew 16:28 - Jesus says to his disciples, &quot;There are some of those <br/>\nstanding here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming <br/>\nin his kingdom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew 24:33-34 - After prophesying a wide assortment of events including <br/>\nthe second coming, Jesus said to his disciples, .&quot; . . when you shall see all <br/>\nthese things, know that it (the 2nd coming) is near, even at the door. This <br/>\ngeneration shall not pass till these things be fulfilled.&quot; He was obviously <br/>\nreferring to the contemporary generation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew 26:64 - When brought before Caiaphas, the Chief Priest, Jesus said to <br/>\nhim, &quot;I tell you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man . . . coming on the <br/>\nclouds of heaven.&quot; According to this the second coming was to happen during <br/>\nCaiaphas&#39; lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark 9:1 - Jesus said to the people and to his disciples, ”Verily I say unto <br/>\nyou, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of <br/>\ndeath, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke 21:27-28 -Jesus said to the rich people, “And then shall they see the <br/>\nSon of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these <br/>\nthings begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your <br/>\nredemption draweth nigh.”<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke 21:32 - Jesus said, again to the rich people, “This generation shall not <br/>\npass away, till all be fulfilled.”<br/>\n<br/>\nI Thessalonians 4:15-17 - In his first Epistle to the Thessalonians Paul <br/>\nassures the congregation that the second coming is very near. .&quot; . . we who <br/>\nare alive, . . . shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord <br/>\nHimself will descend from heaven . . . and the dead in Christ shall rise <br/>\nfirst. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together . . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRevelation 22:7 - Jesus says, &quot;Behold, I come quickly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRevelation 22:12 - Again Jesus says, “Behold, I come quickly.”<br/>\n<br/>\nRevelation 22:20 - Jesus says, &quot;Surely I come quickly.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Weaning","postDate":"1034101774","msgId":45758,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFudjg2ZSs2dWdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwLjI0NDBlMDlhLjJhZDM1ZWFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45660,"nextInTopic":45899,"prevInTime":45757,"nextInTime":45759,"topicId":45283,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where?

Finally, I<br/>\n&gt; began a two-pronged approach to gently wean from the frequent,<br/>\n&gt; NON-feeding daytime sessions (we still had long, relaxed FEEDING<br/>\n&gt; sessions in the morning, at night, and perhaps once, sometimes twice<br/>\n&gt; during the night).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First, I began delaying my response to the request; instead of instantly<br/>\n&gt; dropping what I was doing, I would ask her to wait 10 minutes. Often,<br/>\n&gt; she would go to whatever she was doing while waiting, and forget all<br/>\n&gt; about it. Secondly, when she would either insist she couldn&#39;t wait, or<br/>\n&gt; come back after a few minutes, I would begin to nurse, but if she was<br/>\n&gt; not feeding, but merely (and PAINFULLY) playing/chewing/hanging out, I<br/>\n&gt; would explain that it was uncomfortable for me, and that if all she<br/>\n&gt; wanted was a cuddle, we could cuddle. Often we would just sit or lay<br/>\n&gt; together, skin to skin, and talk or coo for a bit. After a time, she<br/>\n&gt; would get up and proclaim she was done. After a few weeks, she stopped<br/>\n&gt; asking for *ma-ma* during the day, still occasionally asking for a<br/>\n&gt; cuddle, and we continued to have true nursing sessions first thing in<br/>\n&gt; the morning and before/during sleep for a few more months, then she just<br/>\n&gt; sort of tapered off. One day she hadn&#39;t nursed overnight, or in the<br/>\n&gt; morning (just crawled out of bed and started the day without me), and<br/>\n&gt; when sleep time came, I asked if she wanted to nurse, and she simply<br/>\n&gt; said *no, I think I&#39;m not going to do that anymore, ok?*<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, i know many feel it should be completely left to the child, and<br/>\n&gt; more power to you. Also, I&#39;m not sure I would have initiated weaning if<br/>\n&gt; she was still *feeding a lot* as you&#39;ve indicated your daughter is. But<br/>\n&gt; if, for whatever reason (and I&#39;m not clear on yours, so it&#39;s hard to<br/>\n&gt; say) you do decide to wean, my suggestion is to be slow, gentle and<br/>\n&gt; honest, and be sure to remember that a huge part of nursing,especially<br/>\n&gt; in older ones, is about the time and connection.....physical and<br/>\n&gt; emotional. Please be sure to leave a nice, wide open door to that aspect<br/>\n&gt; for your child. :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sally<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Friday, October 4, 2002, at 12:35  AM, Dalene and Andy wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Since there is all this BF talk, I was wondering if anyone could help<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me with weaning ideas.
