Unschooling for us is just an extension of how<br/>\nwere were/are when they are preschoolers.  I tried some sit-at-the-table<br/>\nkind of stuff last year with my 7yr old, he hated it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used Ruth Beechick&#39;s little books and BOB books to get us started when he<br/>\nwas learning to read.  Once he grasped some of it I moved on to more<br/>\ninteresting books.  He picks his own books now and reads at about 4th grade<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cook together, interact in the grocery store (which is<br/>\ncheapest/largest/best buy...what&#39;s the good date on that yogurt...etc),<br/>\npaint, color, walk in the woods, play, play, play.  My kids love any game in<br/>\nwhich they use their imaginations and/or dressing up.  Imaginative play is<br/>\neverything, even when they are playing playmobile or building with blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do watch some tv, some educational, some just for fun, but it&#39;s not the<br/>\nfocus of our day.  We also do chores together and have a weekly playgroup<br/>\nwith a few other families.  We garden, do yardwork, shop.  Just daily stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have specific questions/concerns, please ask.   Hope this gets you<br/>\nstarted!<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy in VA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8896,"nextTopicId":8897}}
