It&#39;s happened maybe four or five times with five kids in a  <br/>\ndozen years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different &quot;parents&quot; of such discussions as these.  My own  <br/>\nfirst examples were La Leche League (which DEFINITELY depends on real  <br/>\npeople sharing real experiences) and Adult Children of Alcoholics,  <br/>\nwhich involves personal stories in a lighter way,  but is more  <br/>\nformulaic and private, and uses only first names, not last.   There  <br/>\nis a group/philosophy called TCS, and they refuse to tell any  <br/>\npersonal stories.  They talk theory only, which makes it useless, in  <br/>\nmy opinion.  It&#39;s a political philosophy at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you joined a list about training horses and no one there  <br/>\nwould even admit if he owned a horse, or if you happened to know he  <br/>\ndid, he refused to answer any direct questions about his horse, but  <br/>\nwould only speak of the way horses should theoretically be trained?    <br/>\nThat&#39;s how it seems to me it would be if we didn&#39;t give real-life  <br/>\nexamples.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you feel uncomfortable, just read and don&#39;t share.  That&#39;s  <br/>\nfine.  The group as a group isn&#39;t going to tell you whether you need  <br/>\nher permission or not.  It IS your experience, your relationship with  <br/>\nyour daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S.","from":"&quot;Angela S.&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Invasion of privacy?","postDate":"1140884065","msgId":112408,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM2M2EyNiQ4YmI4MDhlMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGR0cG9sZyt1M2NlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":112406,"nextInTopic":112413,"prevInTime":112407,"nextInTime":112409,"topicId":112406,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would not post about my children without their permission once they were old enough to understand.
