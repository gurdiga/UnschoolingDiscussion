They insisted that he do that <br/>\non &quot;holidays&quot; (like the college would be open!).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour post got me to thinking if there is any leeway for religious <br/>\nobservances there now.  I&#39;m fairly certain that the most &quot;exotic&quot; <br/>\nreligion in that small Arkansas town where my son went to school was <br/>\nCatholic.  (The snake handlers are considered more orthodox.)  I wish I <br/>\nhad thought of religious observances when I was fighting for him at the <br/>\nschool.  It would have given me a whole new argument in his favor!<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you ever penalized for taking those days off?
