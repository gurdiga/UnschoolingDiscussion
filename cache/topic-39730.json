I&#39;m Reading!: A How-To-Read Book for <br/>\nBeginners. I think the confidence stuff comes in because it gets kids <br/>\nactually reading quickly - using a variety of strategies (see the six listed <br/>\nbelow) and that USING various different strategies, some of which will work <br/>\nbetter, at first, than others, for different kids, they gain confidence and <br/>\nthat supports them as they keep working on learning more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a description of the book: <br/>\n<br/>\n****Learning to read is a big step for anyone. Betty Miles demystifies the <br/>\nprocess by revealing the secrets behind one of life’s most important and <br/>\nenjoyable skills. Hey! I’m Reading! is for children who are just getting <br/>\nready to read — and for the parents, relatives, teachers, and friends who <br/>\nwant to help them. Part 1 tells beginners how much they already know about <br/>\nreading and includes 10 simple questions children can answer for themselves <br/>\nto see if they are ready to use the book. Part 2 introduces new readers to <br/>\nsix skills all readers use to decode words. Part 3 features short stories, <br/>\npoems, and puzzles so beginners can try out their new skills. Armed with <br/>\nconfidence, skills, and practice, children will delight in finding that they <br/>\nare reading!****<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the 6 steps in the &quot;how-to&quot; part of the book -- the book is written <br/>\ndirectly to the kids, by the way, assuming parents are there to help out.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Getting help from pictures. A picture can help to tell you what the words <br/>\nsay. <br/>\n 2. Remembering. You remember some words because you see them over and over. <br/>\n3. Sounding out the letters. The sounds of the letters in a word can help you <br/>\nto read it. <br/>\n4. Expecting what comes next. Expecting words to come along makes you ready <br/>\nto read them. <br/>\n 5. Writing. Writing words is good practice for reading them. <br/>\n6. Making sense.
