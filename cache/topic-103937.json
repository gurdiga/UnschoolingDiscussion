An avatar was a<br/>\nhuman form a god would take to influence the course of human events. In the<br/>\nBaghavadghita, the holy book of Hinduism, Krishna was an avatar. He was the<br/>\neighth or ninth human manifestation of the god Vishnu. He grew up to be<br/>\nPrince Arjuna&#39;s charioteer.

My daughter who is 15 has never had need of reading an analog clock, much less one without numbers, and now in French. I explained it to her, and in five minutes she could read an analog clock using the twenty-four hour system.

Better at reading than I am,<br/>\nand I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The<br/>\nHobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read<br/>\nLord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle<br/>\nEarth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing<br/>\nabout the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the<br/>\nbook, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other<br/>\nTolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the<br/>\nmovie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into<br/>\nMedieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the<br/>\nConqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what<br/>\nthe people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came.<br/>\nShe knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read<br/>\nall of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through<br/>\nCanterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different<br/>\nEnglish accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A<br/>\ntrue Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. Does that description sound like unschooling? I didn&#39;t<br/>\ninterfere with this in any way, besides once in awhile reading a book<br/>\nshe brought home, so we could discuss it.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nthis was posted about two weeks after I first started here, and the <br/>\nrest of the post (about Robby&#39;s inability to tell time, and <br/>\nmy &quot;letting my kids do their math while lying in a puddle of sunshine <br/>\non the floor&quot; LOL it&#39;s making me laugh, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nthough one part of that post:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Ah! and herein lies the rub! *If* Robby pursues only what interests<br/>\nhim, he will be going from video to computer game, and back again to<br/>\nthe TV.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nthat is just exactly where we are right now!
