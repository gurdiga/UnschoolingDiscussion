So we thought, what is good for the goose is good for the  <br/>\ngander. The little guy never slept in a crib because my kids share a  <br/>\nbed since forever. Best decision we ever made was not to get them  <br/>\nseparate beds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do love sleeping with them --it&#39;s my oldest &#39;boy&#39; who doesn&#39;t enjoy  <br/>\nit. Whenever he goes on a business trip the kids sleep with me. On  <br/>\nweekends the kids get to sleep out in the sofa bed and I sometimes  <br/>\njoin in. And if they have a nightmare or are sick, we do end up  <br/>\nsleeping togehter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all though, being able to sleep without a foot up my butt or  <br/>\nthe obnoxious snoring of 3 guys in my bed is, well ... glorious. When  <br/>\nMark&#39;s snoring gets out of control though, I just end up in the sofa;  <br/>\nwhich i have come to love and adore --the sofa, not the snoring :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn NYC it seems, by my not so scientific survey, that sibling &#39;co- <br/>\nsleeping&#39; is indeed common --as well as rampant sofa sleeping. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know why this is not promoted more. It makes so much sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n/ liza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 04 2005, at 02:51 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot; now once they<br/>\n&gt;&gt; started snoring louder than my husband then, hey, with no regrets I<br/>\n&gt;&gt; kicked then the hell out of my bed.

His snoring was part and parcel of <br/>\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - the snoring was the *good* part. The <br/>\nbad part was when he stopped - because that meant he wasn&#39;t <br/>\nbreathing either. So, I&#39;d kick him, he&#39;d snort, gasp, and start <br/>\nsnoring (and breathing) again. By the time I *finally* convinced him <br/>\nto get it checked out (and his doctor mentioned it), the sleep lab <br/>\nrecorded his breathing stopping 100+ times *per hour* overnight. <br/>\nYoiks! Now he has a Constant Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) <br/>\nthat is like an air compressor with a face mask. It forces air in <br/>\nwhen he inhales to keep his throat muscles from getting all loose <br/>\nand collapsing while he&#39;s asleep. It&#39;s not O2, just plain old air. <br/>\nHe is finally, after many many years, getting REM and NREM sleep <br/>\n(the really deep levels) that he wasn&#39;t getting before (stopping <br/>\nbreathing causes waking, even if you don&#39;t notice you are waking).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for those of you with loudly snoring parents, spouses, kids (yes <br/>\nOSA is possible in kids - often related to swollen <br/>\ntonsils/adenoids), get it checked out. It could be something simple <br/>\nlike seasonal allergies or a head cold causing congestion and <br/>\nsnoring. Or it could be something more.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"sleeping in peace","postDate":"1131133866","msgId":109317,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1LjUwYjExMWE3LjMwOWQxNWFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":109319,"prevInTime":109316,"nextInTime":109318,"topicId":109317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
