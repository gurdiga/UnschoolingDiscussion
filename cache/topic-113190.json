Mostly, to play soccer.  He decided to return to unschooling after that.  I chronicled some of the experience on my blog.

They&#39;re date-stamped, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a fascinating experience - good, bad, ugly, and everything in between.  Lots of highs, lots of lows.  We learned a lot about ourselves - all of us.  We are happy for the experience and happy it&#39;s over.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\nwww.piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com<br/>\n*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221315529,"authorName":"HMS Dragonfly","from":"HMS Dragonfly &lt;hmsdragonfly@...&gt;","profile":"hmsdragonfly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Unschooler now in school","postDate":"1236100064","msgId":113191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEwMS1XMzUwMUYzQzJDQTRDMUZEQ0E1MTJCREJBNjBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDU1ODc5OS44MTMzMC5xbUB3ZWI1MTQwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDU1ODc5OS44MTMzMC5xbUB3ZWI1MTQwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":113190,"nextInTopic":113192,"prevInTime":113190,"nextInTime":113192,"topicId":113190,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have one of those, too.
