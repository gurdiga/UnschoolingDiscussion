However, I also think it&#39;s possible to be <br/>\na<br/>\nresponsible owner and not use dogfood, which some folks consider a<br/>\nconsumerism thing.  I think that&#39;s what several people here have been <br/>\ngetting at.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about feeding your animals responsibly and then periodically acting<br/>\n&quot;irresponsible&quot; by giving them table scraps.  It&#39;s more about considering<br/>\nhow your dog could be fed differently; using leftover people food, food that<br/>\nis inedible for people or disagreeable to them as (part of or entirely)<br/>\ntheir pet&#39;s regular diet.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOop, I totally agree with everything you just said. Didn&#39;t want to sound <br/>\nlike I&#39;m against people who feed their dogs differently than I do. I use to <br/>\nactually cook for my Dobie every day. Then again, I only had one child <br/>\ntoo!!! And every now and then, the ones we have now do get a few scraps of <br/>\ncertain things. Not poptart but leftover steak and stuff, just very small <br/>\namounts. I find it agrees with them better as they are still puppies and I <br/>\nstill have a hard enough time making sure they get outside when they need <br/>\ntoo. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My point about weight was merely to point out an inconsistency in us <br/>\nhumans<br/>\n-- we&#39;re so worried about doing the right thing for our animals and yet we<br/>\nknow the right thing ourselves and don&#39;t necessarily do it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I have to agree once again. Kind of like Dr.&#39;s smoking. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I wonder if dogs, given free access to food, would eventually demonstrate <br/>\nwhat we<br/>\nalready know children do: self-regulate.  They did in the wild, right?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell kind of I think. Dogs in the wild once again weren&#39;t fat so I guess <br/>\nthey did self regulate, or was it just that they didn&#39;t have access to food <br/>\nall the time? Finding food was a hard thing to do then for them. Just like <br/>\nwolves now can starve on their own. Also, dogs today are not the dogs from <br/>\nthe wild. There is great speculation that domestic dogs didn&#39;t even come <br/>\nfrom the wolves and jackals we know of now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;m ready to take the step to find out on my own <br/>\nright now. Maybe when the kids are older and I have more house to myself and <br/>\nmore yard!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] dogfood again (still?)","postDate":"1033477660","msgId":44938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzLjEyODU3Zjk1LjJhY2FmODFjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44923,"nextInTopic":44978,"prevInTime":44937,"nextInTime":44939,"topicId":44923,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/1/02 3:39:02 AM, abtleo@earthlink.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1101451537\">In a message dated 10/1/02 3:39:02 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  I wonder if<br/>\ndogs, given free access to food, would eventually demonstrate what we<br/>\nalready know children do: self-regulate.
