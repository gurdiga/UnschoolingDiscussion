He<br/>\nlived for two months, from May to July.  I&#39;m sorry about your loss that<br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first took my three children from public school, I thought about only<br/>\ntaking the oldest out, as he was about to enter middle school.  My dh and I<br/>\ndecided that it would be a lot better for the family to take all three<br/>\nchildren out at the same time.  This let us begin to live by family time, as<br/>\nopposed to school times.  It also enabled us to do things together, enjoy<br/>\neach other, and let the three of them get to really know their new baby<br/>\nbrother.  It seemed daunting - beginning to homeschool three children,<br/>\nages11, 9, and 8, with a six week old baby.  On the other hand, I told<br/>\nfriends and family that this way if the baby kept me up all night, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be up at 6 screaming at everyone to &quot;Hurry up, get dressed, eat<br/>\nbreakfast, find your homework, &#39;You need How much money, for What?&#39;, I need<br/>\nto sign what?, Don&#39;t miss the bus cuz I&#39;m not driving you 20 miles to<br/>\nschool, etc...&quot;  Instead, we slept in if we felt like it (that first year as<br/>\nlate as 8 am sometimes - lol).  We relaxed.  We had fun together as a<br/>\nfamily.  I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who wants a completely different<br/>\nlifestyle than the hectic rush that public schools seem to force.  I&#39;d<br/>\ndefinitely encourage you to keep both children together - I think you&#39;ll be<br/>\nhappier setting their &quot;schedules&quot; (or lack thereof) than to try and live by<br/>\nthe school schedule for one child and not for the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I haven&#39;t waited two weeks to jump in.  I hope that&#39;s okay.  More<br/>\nabout me later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53407,"nextTopicId":53412}}
