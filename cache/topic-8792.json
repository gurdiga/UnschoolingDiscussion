It&#39;s been a good thing <br/>\nfor us in the way of being much closer to the library, stores, parks, etc.  <br/>\nBut, we do miss the country...the peace and quiet.  I wouldn&#39;t make a <br/>\nblanket statement that neighbors in the country are better than ones in the <br/>\ncity.  People is people.  But, in the country you&#39;ve got plenty space <br/>\nbetween you and those who aren&#39;t so personable.  Being in the city we&#39;ve cut <br/>\ndown on gas costs for the vehicles and the wear and tear on them.  I&#39;d say <br/>\ntho&#39; it all depends on what you prefer and are willing to tolerate in either <br/>\nplace.  Our kids love being able to walk to just about any place we want to. <br/>\n  And having friends nearer; but they have also remarked a number of times <br/>\nthat they miss living in the country.  I think maybe 10 years down the road, <br/>\nwe may look to move to the country again.  But for our family and our <br/>\nsituation, living in the city and visiting in the country is working out <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in the country.  I wasn&#39;t &quot;cut-off&quot; socially because of it.  It <br/>\nsimply meant that my parents had to do a lot more driving to get me where I <br/>\nneeded to go.  But I loved living in the country, walking in the woods and <br/>\nalong the creek.  Sitting in the stillness and just listening to the breeze <br/>\nrustling the leaves of trees and bushes.   Lots of opportunity to think and <br/>\ndream.  That&#39;s what I miss most...enjoying nature and it&#39;s sounds, smelling <br/>\nthat fresh country air.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s my two cents worth.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Michelle Bennett&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mlb_2boymom@...\">mlb_2boymom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] country living-pros and cons<br/>\n&gt;Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 07:05:37 EST<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hello Everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve been reading about several of you living on farms and lots of acreage.<br/>\n&gt;We are currently looking at some land many, many miles from where we live<br/>\n&gt;now, but closer to my dh&#39;s work.
