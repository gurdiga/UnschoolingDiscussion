I myself don&#39;t agree with <br/>\nsome of the disciplining methods that are suggested (such as time-<br/>\nout), but I still found the book fascinating to read, esp. with <br/>\nregard to ADD and other such labels and kids not accepting &quot;no&quot; for <br/>\nan answer. Their website is www.indigochild.com. I would be really <br/>\ninterested to hear what you people think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was on this list where someone else mentioned <br/>\nwww.awareparenting.com, which also happens to be one of my favourite <br/>\nsites.<br/>\n<br/>\nBye for now,<br/>\nNicoletta</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8675,"nextTopicId":8729}}
