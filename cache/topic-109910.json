She will be 13 in January and I think she is just wanting to transform her little girls&#39; room into something she feels is more grown up.

However, I have done several things to be<br/>\nable to afford to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a local natural food store with a great bulk food section. Buying<br/>\nthings this way is much cheaper than even the store brand in some cases. You<br/>\nhave to serve yourself - and there aren&#39;t shopping bags and other things<br/>\nthat would cause overhead at this store. You can also look for a natural<br/>\nfood co-op in your area where you share bulk buying with other members. This<br/>\nbrings the cost down as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also joined a CSA farm ( Consumer Supported Agriculture) and I worked 70<br/>\nhours throughout the season in exchange for the share of organic fresh<br/>\nveggies and herbs each week. this was great for me and myr kids as they went<br/>\nalong and helped some weeks, played or found all kinds of interesting bugs<br/>\nand snakes ( We even saw a hummingbird on its nest!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI go to local farmers markets and (lucky for me I am in Amish country!) can<br/>\nfind great meats that are local and fresh and have many are grass-fed and<br/>\ngroan without hormones, yogurt, cheese, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another local homeschool mom that has a farm where we get our milk,<br/>\neggs and some chicken, turkey & I bought a 1/8 of a cow cut up and packaged<br/>\nand delivered to my freezer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what was said about the little steps are important. It&#39;s not all or<br/>\nnothing. We actually ate at McDonalds today because we met friends and<br/>\nexchanged kids. I make better choices at McDonalds than before....Salad and<br/>\nparfait are not bad - but the kids usually like nuggets, fries and soda -<br/>\nand I don&#39;t think it is horrible because on average we eat pretty healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may not always have the money to go to the natural food store, although I<br/>\nfind that I will then choose the items of most importance to buy organic. I<br/>\nusually eat less meat that week - and buy some organic, I cook a lot form<br/>\nscratch - and tonight even we had scrambled eggs and buckwheat pancakes with<br/>\nlocal maple syrup. I don&#39;t buy a lot of cookies and cakes and stuff, but<br/>\ntend to bake with the kids. We have a vita mix and I make homemade ice cream<br/>\nand smoothies often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t all happen overnight....but one thing led to another and it is<br/>\ndo-able.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some sources that will help you find local stuff in your area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organicconsumers.org/purelink.html\">http://www.organicconsumers.org/purelink.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/\">http://www.localharvest.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!

Chicken<br/>\npatties, hotdogs, hamburgers all have veggie alternatives of course. Tacos<br/>\nare easy to do this with.  If I&#39;m doing a meal like roast chicken or beef,<br/>\nthen I just make sure there are quick and easy veggie &quot;meats&quot; available to<br/>\nheat up. Kate would do that herself.  I would make sure to do some<br/>\nvegetarian meals as well since we like that anyway.  As long as I have the<br/>\nalternatives handy, it wasn&#39;t&#39; much extra work.

I don&#39;t know where I picked up this &#39;all or nothing&#39; type thinking, but what you just wrote should be so simple and obvious, except for many people it&#39;s not.<br/>\n  This will help me with my kids.  When they have an interest or want certain supplies, I don&#39;t always have the money at the time.  But I always have some money and can get them some of it now instead of waiting until I can buy everything.<br/>\n  One of my kids has been wanting to redecorate her bedroom.  I&#39;m thinking I can&#39;t do new furniture right now, but I can buy paint, fabrics, stencils, posters and many other things that would allow her to do much of what she wants.  The rest can come later.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks for the post,<br/>\n  Ann<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

It <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help anything.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s not &quot;crap&quot; on one end and the perfect-yet-unaffordable food on the <br/>\nother, with a choice between the two.    Every time you shop you have a choice, <br/>\nand you can make the better choice of the things you can afford.   Each time <br/>\nyou decide how to prepare something, you have choices.   If you don&#39;t want to <br/>\nchoose among a hundred or a dozen, give yourself two choices:   omelette or <br/>\nscrambled?   Butter or spray?   (not a good example for vegans; fine for <br/>\nvegetarians).

It seems simple, but I was surprised when I thought <br/>\nof that way to ratchet the quality of life up to find how many times I was <br/>\nacting without really thinking.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIt first came up when a friend who was being knighted was saying that he felt <br/>\nbad that he didn&#39;t have good a good period-looking camp, and he couldn&#39;t <br/>\nafford one, so   he had to look shabby all the time.      I   said if you always <br/>\nmake the better choice, gradually your equipment will get better.   If you can <br/>\nonly afford a nylon tent, get a brown one instead of a blue one.   If you&#39;re <br/>\nbuying used dishes, choose what looks older.     <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving that idea almost 20 years ago changed my own life.   Kirby was a baby, <br/>\nand I used that method on my own life, not just on improving my camp (which <br/>\nwas already better than other aspects of my life), and I still do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t choose between crap and unaffordable.
