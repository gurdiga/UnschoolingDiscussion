As Gatto has pointed out and documented, the design<br/>\nof the system is to prevent inquiry, to quash dissent, to teach the absolute<br/>\nworship of authority. Thus, the school employees have taken on the roles of<br/>\na weird kind of clergy, talking down to the masses of parents who seek even<br/>\na little control over the lives and learning of the children they send to<br/>\nthose institutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we have allowed it to happen, but government has used all its tricks to<br/>\nmake us think that we have wanted it, and is still doing that. In this<br/>\nsense, the saying we hear...&quot;We ARE the government&quot; is simply not<br/>\ntrue...government employees and &quot;leaders&quot; have huge resources that no group<br/>\nof citizens can command, and they use them to keep the population as<br/>\nignorant as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking our children out of that system and being responsible for them in<br/>\nevery way is the only road back from the sellout that has happened. Whatever<br/>\nits cost, we owe it to our kids to keep them safe from the damage that the<br/>\ngovernment does to them with its schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40218,"nextTopicId":40121}}
