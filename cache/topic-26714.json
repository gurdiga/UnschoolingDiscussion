I worked in a facility<br/>\nwith an acute psych wing.  Did the intake and ran some of the groups and<br/>\nrarely saw much confrontational therapy and when I did, didn&#39;t see much in<br/>\nthe way of results.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good therapist would stop and back up if they saw a person squirm and try<br/>\nto crawl into the chair they are sitting on, kinda like looking for an<br/>\nescape hatch with that &quot;what did I get myself into&quot; look on their face.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, it works for some and sure some of those folks &quot;look&quot; like they are<br/>\no.k. with what he is doing.  But more of them look like good little Stepford<br/>\nwives nodding their heads like those plastic things that folks use to put in<br/>\nthe back window of cars or on their dash.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see the same looks on half the faces of folks when she does the book<br/>\nthing.

On one show,<br/>\na woman tried about 4 or 5 times to explain what she meant and why she was<br/>\nwhere she was at.  He interrupted her everytime and told her she was wrong<br/>\nand making excuses.  It was one put down after another--&quot;don&#39;t you get it,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;stop making excuses,&quot; &quot;get real,&quot; and then goes on to say &quot;do you know why<br/>\nI&#39;m picking on you.&quot;  Poor woman looked dazed and confused and he just kept<br/>\non pounding.  Not terribly professional, more along the lines of shock<br/>\njocks, not a therapist.  And obviously he is the one that was having the<br/>\nblonde moment and &quot;doesn&#39;t get it&quot; because there is a difference between<br/>\nexplaining and excuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, now you know how I really feel &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Julie Stauffer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jnjstau@...\">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 05, 2001 10:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1523<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Dr. Phil......verbal abuse&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You really see Dr. Phil as abusive?!?!?!?!?
