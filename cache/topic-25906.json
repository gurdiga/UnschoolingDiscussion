And of course the<br/>\ngirls are right there telling me what they find interesting about the book,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of weeks ago Mikey (4 in a few weeks) was drawing and brought me a<br/>\npicture. She&#39;d written, for the first time ever, a few letters of the<br/>\nalphabet. Three times each in &quot;words&quot; read YIM -- knowing my little<br/>\nleft-hander as I do &lt;g&gt; I readily decoded this to spell &quot;Mikey&quot; (backwards<br/>\nand missing a few letters &lt;g&gt;) and she was delighted that I was bright<br/>\nenough to get it. ;) I can only imagine the blow to my image if I&#39;d made the<br/>\nmistake of trying to correct it, however gently, to my way of spelling Mikey<br/>\nat that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I think there&#39;s a lot less danger and damage if when-in-doubt I<br/>\nhush up and see what the kids have to say about it all first. If I try an<br/>\nexperiment and I feel goofy or they seem bored or overwhelmed, retreat is<br/>\nIMHO the best strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"brendaclaspell@aol.com","from":"brendaclaspell@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"8AG0wK7-DJq5cKrZZ-EBvG3kSAPEFnuS5awsavgTa5c-Q0yoiiZzQovM3M_00Exts8t3brVPh-g66JHNHg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question about reading","postDate":"1000780701","msgId":25906,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNy40M2QxMmU0LjI4ZDgwZDlkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25921,"prevInTime":25905,"nextInTime":25907,"topicId":25906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 3yo son has shown no interest in reading yet, and I m not concerned at all.

Sorry if this was dealt with in an <br/>\nearlier thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith reading, is it something for them to just pick up entirely on their own, <br/>\nor should I point stuff out? I mean we read a lot of books, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally try to focus on him getting the words or reading or anything. I&#39;ve <br/>\nsort of been of the opinion that when he wants to or is ready, he&#39;ll start on <br/>\nhis own. It just hit me tonight that maybe I should be pointing out words <br/>\nmore or &#39;trying&#39; to get him to notice small words. I think I may have just <br/>\nanswered my own question :-), but I could still use a bit of feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25980,"nextTopicId":25982}}
