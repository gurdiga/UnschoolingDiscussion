It&#39;s me Ang, I haven&#39;t read or posted here for awhile.  You wanna <br/>\nknow how I handled the family members, once and for all? I sent them <br/>\nthis really long email. I got tired of the &quot;concerns&quot; and the veiled <br/>\ninsults, so I put it in writing (i do best writing and not with in-<br/>\nperson conflicts). I am browsing posts and saw this question about <br/>\nresponding to family members, so here it is. Everyone i know who has <br/>\nemail got copied. No one came back and questioned me, except one aunt <br/>\nwho asked what LOL means. And i did get some complimentary feedback. <br/>\nI put it out there and how they feel about it at this point is their <br/>\nproblem. It&#39;s long, i tried not to be too offensive, and i when i say <br/>\nI &quot;use&quot; the world book scope and sequence, all that means is i scan <br/>\nit and say yep, yep, covered that, this would count for that, etc. No <br/>\nforced curriculum. And it helps me organize my portfolio for year-end <br/>\nassessment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd an extra plug for no limits on tv, food, whatever the children <br/>\nare feared to get carried away with. It works. Trust your instincts, <br/>\nthey work. Trust your children, they&#39;re brilliant. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a little honesty here: I was getting way too consumed with this <br/>\ngroup. I was starting to question, in a bad way, every little <br/>\ndecision or thing that happened. I began to second-guess everything I <br/>\ndid  and look to the list &quot;experts&quot; for insight and approval. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t trust myself completely to make own choices anymore. Really. I <br/>\nwas losing touch with my own instincts, instincts that serve me well <br/>\nwhen I listen to them. So I took a break, and i am in a better place <br/>\nnow. I am more in-tune to my kids needs and what works for us without <br/>\nsecond-guessing every thing we are doing.  I was spending way too <br/>\nmuch time online away from my kids and it was putting too many <br/>\ncriticizing voices in my head. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks for the wisdom of people who share so much of their time, I <br/>\napologize that I can&#39;t spend more time here. I hope you understand. I <br/>\nthink that is a testimony, that you can learn so much here that you <br/>\ncan leave it behind with confidence that you can unschool <br/>\nsuccessfully. The legacy lives on in my daily life. I miss you guys, <br/>\nhence my browsing here tonight. Maybe someday i will find the balance <br/>\nto be active here again. <br/>\n<br/>\nwell, here it is for those interested in reading...(email me offlist <br/>\nif you want to comment or slam me, i am on no mail on this list :0)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUBJECT: For the Record<br/>\n10/08/03<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote this to go with a picture of numbers that Ashlyn wrote. The <br/>\npic is a springboard to qualify my feelings on some issues about our <br/>\nhomeschooling. Stop reading now if you don&#39;t want to hear about it. <br/>\nOr print and read it later so as not to stir you at an inconvenient <br/>\ntime. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too provocative, but it&#39;s less accusing than <br/>\nthe ones I wrote in the past and never sent about our homeschooling <br/>\ndecision and defending some points, after feeling attacked and <br/>\ninsulted for so long. LOL!! (I have scanned the pic if you want it <br/>\nemailed to you.)<br/>\n <br/>\nI am copying this to everyone because when I am this excited about <br/>\nsomething I can hardly contain it. I have kept a lot to myself out of <br/>\nfear of backlash or frustrating misunderstanding. The &quot;people&quot; <br/>\nreferred to is not necessarily anyone in particular reading this, but <br/>\ncomes from many different experiences from many people, including <br/>\nfamily, friends, and even strangers over the past few years. So no <br/>\nfinger pointing, but if you recognize yourself in here somewhere, <br/>\ndon&#39;t hesitate to ask me for clarification. Some of you may also be <br/>\nreading this who have never openly questioned me, but you may have <br/>\nunspoken questions or doubts. I hope this addresses it all. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhy do I feel the need to prove what we do works for us? Probably <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t get the overall impression that I get the benefit of <br/>\nthe doubt with this endeavor. So read it or not, groan, laugh, roll <br/>\nyour eyes, or heck, nod in agreement.  You won&#39;t hurt my feelings. Or <br/>\nchange my mind :0)  I am writing this just as much for me as for <br/>\nanyone else. I&#39;ll be cheering myself on even if no one else feels <br/>\ncompelled to. LOL  So here goes.......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not teach Ashlyn(4) how to write those numbers. She learned by <br/>\nliving daily life and being a curious kid. This is *the foundation of <br/>\nmy homeschooling philosophy*, that kids will learn without coercion <br/>\nwhat they need to familiarize themselves with the world around them. <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mysteriously stop at some arbitrary age. Christian(2) can <br/>\ncount to ten and name colors the same way. No one ever decided they <br/>\nneeded to know these things and sat them down and taught them with a <br/>\nprogram. Just like learning to walk and talk, it&#39;s like the air they <br/>\nbreathe. <br/>\n <br/>\nLearning is everywhere, there is no magic formula for kids to be <br/>\nfilled with regimented instruction, they will seek it on their own as <br/>\nlong as their curiosity hasn&#39;t been stamped out by drilling and <br/>\nforceful teaching and controlling and shaming for not performing. <br/>\nLearning comes from desire and interest and is retained because it <br/>\nhas personal meaning. Memorizing facts at school to be sometimes <br/>\nforgotten or discarded because they are not relevant or useful <br/>\npersonally is not the same.  I say these things from experience of my <br/>\nschooling, Megan&#39;s schooling, and others&#39; experiences that have been <br/>\nshared with me. YMMV-- Your Mileage May Vary. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy job in the capacity of homeschooling and parenting in general is <br/>\nto provide a loving, rich, nurturing environment and lots of <br/>\nguidance. Lots of exposure to important and interesting things about <br/>\nour world and the past. Setting good examples for reading, <br/>\nresearching, and finding out new things everyday. Imparting a sense <br/>\nof discovery and fascination about so many things about our existence <br/>\nin this life.  Paying a lot of attention and noticing when my kids <br/>\nneed something, or want to learn more about something without pushing <br/>\nthem into my own agenda. With my tendency to be dramatic about such <br/>\nthings, these goals are actually accomplished rather simply and <br/>\nbeautifully. <br/>\n <br/>\nMegan(11) learns the same way as my younger two. And we are happy and <br/>\njoyful living and learning this way and no one is going to change <br/>\nthat LOL. I am not saying these things to start a debate, I just <br/>\ndon&#39;t know that I&#39;ve ever explained what we do and why quite this <br/>\nway. I get regular evidence like this picture, or a conversation, or <br/>\nmany other clues and intimate knowledge and daily affirmation of how <br/>\nand what my children learn. It&#39;s amazing. I am absolutely confident <br/>\nin how this works. I have gotten defensive, not that I don&#39;t believe <br/>\nin this valid decision, but that people don&#39;t have faith that I&#39;m <br/>\nintelligent enough to know what I&#39;m doing with my kids.   We <br/>\nappreciate other peoples&#39; concerns, but we find most fears to be <br/>\nunfounded. Generally, they are false assumptions or lack of <br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe absolutely know what we are doing. And we don&#39;t criticize or find <br/>\nfault with other&#39;s decisions now or in the past on how to educate <br/>\ntheir children. To each his own! Schools serve their own purpose and <br/>\nmeet the needs of some, but they are not the answer for every child <br/>\nor family. We just wish more people would believe in us and not <br/>\nopenly criticize and look for deficits to dismiss our whole <br/>\nlifestyle. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt took me a year and a half to make the decision to bring Megan <br/>\nhome, it wasn&#39;t something I did lightly. I tried everything I knew to <br/>\nhelp her be successful in school, including some ganging up on her <br/>\nwith the school staff that I horribly regret. I researched and read <br/>\nand deliberated, and I finally just went for it. I do not regret it <br/>\nfor one second, except for not doing it sooner. Believe that I am <br/>\ndoing what I think is in her best interest, no other reason. We are <br/>\ndoing this from love and trust, not fear. And we trust all of our <br/>\nchildren to give them a choice to go to public school at anytime. I <br/>\nam no martyr, but a lot of personal sacrifice goes into <br/>\nhomeschooling, it is not the path of least resistance. In other <br/>\nwords, I am not doing it to take the easy way out of school, just as <br/>\nI don&#39;t think schooling parents are doing it likewise. Each have <br/>\ntheir own demands and stresses, I have been down both roads. At the <br/>\nsame time, I don&#39;t find homeschooling too much to ask of myself, I <br/>\nfind it a worthy investment. My choices are based on my own findings <br/>\nand experiences and values, not reflective of anyone else&#39;s choice. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs I&#39;ve said all along, there are no guarantees. Going to school does <br/>\nnot guarantee a great education and a happy, successful life. Nor <br/>\ndoes homeschooling. But Megan is learning that she can trust herself <br/>\nand her curiosity, that she can do anything she sets her mind to, <br/>\nthat she can make her own decisions slowly with confidence and <br/>\nsupport from me. She wasn&#39;t getting that in school, she was <br/>\ngetting &quot;you don&#39;t know what you need, so for your own good, do as we <br/>\nsay, don&#39;t think for yourself. Do this or else.&quot; She was not learning <br/>\nmuch, and she was becoming more withdrawn and defiant. Her spark was <br/>\ngone. It is taking a long time for her to heal and blossom again, but <br/>\nI have already seen enough to know we made the right decision.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople may never understand my perspective. There are some great <br/>\nbooks that would help to understand, like the Unschooling Handbook by <br/>\nMary Griffith, the Homeschooling Book of Answers by Linda Dobson, <br/>\nanything by John Holt or John Taylor Gatto. It seems no one who <br/>\ndebates with me wants to hear or understand or learn about the <br/>\nmechanics of it, they just want to find fault and make disparaging <br/>\ncomments. To justify their own choice? To defend any perceived <br/>\ncriticism of their lifestyle, where there is none implied? Who knows. <br/>\n <br/>\nI do know I have a two year-end portfolios completed, no one has <br/>\nlooked or asked to look if they were aware of them. Sometimes it <br/>\nseems like some are only looking for reasons to justify not believing <br/>\nin our choice, not rejoicing in our successes. That&#39;s okay. I <br/>\nunderstand. I&#39;ll try not to take it so personally anymore. I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant it to be a source of conflict and ill feelings. <br/>\n <br/>\nI also know when I was going over Worldbook&#39;s Scope and Sequence for <br/>\nend of last school year that Megan had covered everything but two <br/>\nsmall details. Without scheduling any lessons by me. Does anyone <br/>\nrealize that the curriculum for 5th grade at (current local school) <br/>\nis not the same as (previous local school) or any other public <br/>\nschool? The bureaucrats cannot not agree on a nationwide or even <br/>\nstatewide curriculum. So I use Worldbook&#39;s and a book I have on <br/>\ncustom curriculums. A lot of the stuff is repetitive from year to <br/>\nyear. They keep going over the same stuff.   She may not get the <br/>\nexact lesson in the exact order of school, but I&#39;m assured she gets <br/>\njust as much retained and probably more. We count every moment of the <br/>\nday as learning, and she easily gets her 900 hours a year just by <br/>\nwriting things down that look remotely educational. <br/>\n <br/>\nNot to mention her overall attitude and maturity have progressed so <br/>\nmuch. What may not be outwardly visible to others is crystal clear to <br/>\nme. She still has a lot of spirited qualities in her personality that <br/>\nnothing will change. I&#39;m learning different responses and ways to <br/>\nhandle them, and she is learning to better utilize them. That&#39;s a <br/>\nwhole &#39;nother email and book recommendation! <br/>\n <br/>\nSo here&#39;s hope to new understanding. We celebrate this lifestyle and <br/>\nhave found immeasurable joy, and we want folks to be happy for us. <br/>\nJust as we are happy when folks are living the life they want to <br/>\nlead. Of course it isn&#39;t perfect, we have our bad moments and bad <br/>\ndays, make our fair share of mistakes, but I still thank God every <br/>\nday Megan is who she is and her &quot;problems&quot; were opportunities to lead <br/>\nus to a wonderful journey.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIf I never breathe another word about homeschooling to anyone, this <br/>\nis my position for the record. <br/>\n <br/>\nIn mutual respect,<br/>\n <br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Amy/Taking the Plunge","postDate":"1068221914","msgId":84123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczLjM3NDFlNTMyLjJjZGQxZmRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":84116,"nextInTopic":84227,"prevInTime":84122,"nextInTime":84124,"topicId":83965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it would be too, too cruel to hand out homeschooling tracts.

If they&#39;re not really interested in what the kids are <br/>\ndoing, go on about that endlessly and they&#39;ll learn real quick not to <br/>\nask. I refuse to justify what we&#39;re doing. Glad to discuss, but I refuse <br/>\nto be interrogated or to have to satisfy someone who wrongly thinks they <br/>\nhave the right to judge what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately for the kids, the other grandmother is totally interested in <br/>\nwhat they do, and is always talking to them, asking questions, and is <br/>\ngenuinely interested, which makes up for a lot. Recently we visited some <br/>\nold family friends that the kids didn&#39;t know very well. My mother&#39;s <br/>\nfriend showed more interest in my oldest&#39;s acting than her grandparents <br/>\never have. She was in tears, that someone could be that nice to her, and <br/>\nshow such an interest. I realized that she thinks her cold grandparents <br/>\nare normal, and her nana, who lives far away but is very interested is <br/>\nkind of unusual. It was then that I finally realized how much her nearby <br/>\ngrandparents have hurt her with their disinterest in what she does. <br/>\nMakes me both sad and furious.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve in what you&#39;re doing and let that show, and put your kids first. <br/>\nWish I had stood up more firmly to the in-laws years ago.<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, November 6, 2003, at 08:09  AM, Gary & Lisa Williams wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all~<br/>\n&gt; How do you respond to family members?<br/>\n&gt; Now that the holidays are here and we get to spend time with <br/>\n&gt; &quot;well-meaning&quot;<br/>\n&gt; relatives who have no clue as to what I am &quot;doing&quot; with my kids, what <br/>\n&gt; do you<br/>\n&gt; tell them when they grill you on &quot;school&quot;.
