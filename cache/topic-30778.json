When I find myself frustrated about the kidlets<br/>\nseeming to spend mindless hours in front of the TV,  I find that the lack of<br/>\nother opportunities a major factor.  My oldest is brginning to understand<br/>\nthat she sometimes turns it on from a can&#39;t-think -of anything-else-to-do<br/>\nrather than an I&#39;d-really-like-to-watch-something-on-TV viewpoint.<br/>\n    that&#39;s,  to me,  where unschooling is quite challenging at times from<br/>\nthe adult perspective.  My own creative energy ebbs and flows.....when I am<br/>\nstronger,  more energetic,  and creative...we all see more choices in what<br/>\nwe want to do,  how well we interact,  etc.<br/>\nthanks for sharing youe experience, Kolleen!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30774,"nextTopicId":30779}}
