That&#39;s why he must <br/>\neat the crust.  We just can&#39;t afford to waste it.  (That&#39;s also why <br/>\nwe&#39;re looking for a job in the states...)  BTW, he loves ALL his <br/>\nvegetables (even cabbage and broccoli!) except spinach and green <br/>\npeppers and he will eat those if I chop them up really small and hide <br/>\nthem in other foods.  When he was younger, I&#39;d dry out the bread crusts <br/>\nin the freezer and the next day I&#39;d pour milk on it like cereal.  He <br/>\nused to love it.  Now he prefers it with the rest of the bread.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like it, but he understands we don&#39;t waste food.<br/>\n<br/>\nNEways...<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1170,"nextTopicId":1176}}
