So far I&#39;ve been<br/>\npretty lucky when I tell people that we are homeschooling my DD Karen<br/>\n(2 years). Of course, the only people I&#39;ve told have been family and<br/>\nmost of them totally agree with DH and myself. That all changed<br/>\ntoday. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd and I are part of a play group that meets every other week at<br/>\ndifferent parks in the area. I had mentioned a while back that we<br/>\nwere considering homeschooling Karen to one of the other mothers and<br/>\nshe seemed supportive, even offered to get me an email address of a<br/>\nrelative who is homeschooling. Today, she asked me if we had decided<br/>\nfor sure and, when I told her that we were going to be homeschooling,<br/>\nshe got sort of hostile. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve read about the<br/>\nhostility that others have faced but, I guess I just didn&#39;t expect it<br/>\nto come from anyone that I know personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s was a public school teacher before having her baby 2 years ago,<br/>\nby the way. She started out asking me general questions about why we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to send Karen to public school and wanted to know how it<br/>\nall work legally. Then, she started trying to convince me how great<br/>\nthe school district is that I live in and how her cousin really likes<br/>\nthe Elementary School that&#39;s just down the street from my house. When<br/>\nI told her that, in California, you can be listed as a private school<br/>\nand not have to report to the state and pretty much do you own thing.<br/>\nThat&#39;s when I could tell she got really hostile. She tried telling<br/>\nme that I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about and that, even if that<br/>\nwas the case, I should still report in weekly with a district person<br/>\nand have Karen tested periodically since I didn&#39;t want to deprive her<br/>\nof learning and making sure she&#39;s on course! Excuse me?! THEN, she<br/>\nstarted talking about the social aspect of not going to school. And,<br/>\nI would want to be connected with a school, just in case Karen decided<br/>\nthat she wanted to join afterschool activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I told her that I was part of a homeschooling group here in town<br/>\nthat meets once a week, she started saying how they are probably all<br/>\n&quot;hippie&quot; types who grow and eat their own food and &quot;that type of<br/>\nthing.&quot; Even if they WERE all like that, which they aren&#39;t, what in<br/>\nthe hell is wrong with growing and eating your own fruits and<br/>\nveggies?! That alone teaches kids a heck of a lot. I didn&#39;t even<br/>\ntell her that we were planning on unschooling....can&#39;t imagine what<br/>\nshe would have said to that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only nice thing she said about homeschooling was about her cousin,<br/>\nthe one who homeschools her kids. But, from what she said, that woman<br/>\nhas a school at home type setup which it totally the opposite of what<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to be doing. I guess I&#39;m so upset because this is a woman<br/>\nthat I really like and have been &quot;friends&quot; with for a while. I just<br/>\ndidn&#39;t expect it from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrrrrr,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69072,"nextTopicId":69047}}
