I had some conversations with her about how <br/>\n<br/>\nvery frightening the first night was and how she wished someone would have <br/>\nbeen more open with her.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was married for the first time at 17.  She had never had sex nor <br/>\nseen a naked man. AND, ( get this, its unbelievable)  She STILL hadn&#39;t <br/>\nactually seen a naked man when they divored a few years later.. ?!?!? She <br/>\nsaid he insisted on keeping the lights off.. He undressed in the dark, got <br/>\ninto bed, and well, she never really &quot;saw&quot; him naked.  He ended up emptying <br/>\nher her bank account and stealing her car.  She lived with her mil for 6 mos <br/>\ntil he came back.. She went back to him.. and in another few mos, he pulled <br/>\nthe same crap.. cept this time, it wasnt long til he got drafted.  She had <br/>\nlearned by the 2nd time that he duped her that he was bad news, but she <br/>\nwouldnt give him a divorce while he was in the service because she recieved <br/>\nspousal support.  ANYWAY. she also didnt sleep with my Dad ( her husband of <br/>\n37 years) til they got married. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was a virgin at 17 when I met my husband.  We did sleep together after he <br/>\nproposed to me.   I cant say only having sex with the man I married  was the <br/>\nbest thing.  I have very mixed feelings about it.  Being with only one man <br/>\nhas it definite rewards and lends a very  special bond.. But, well, it also <br/>\nleaves a lot of questions and what ifs that we have both had to work through. <br/>\n   I would definitly not condone &quot;sleeping around&quot; casually with multiple <br/>\npartners.. And, I also wouldnt want my kids to have sex too young.   But, I <br/>\nwouldnt want them to marry someone just so they could have sex with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54402,"nextTopicId":54405}}
