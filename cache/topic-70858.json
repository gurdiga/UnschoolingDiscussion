What I usually do is try to find out how<br/>\n&gt;   much something weighs (since that&#39;s the way that the post office<br/>\n&gt;   calculates postage).  I used to have a post office across the street<br/>\n&gt;   from me with a scale so it was easy.  Now, I package what I&#39;m selling<br/>\n&gt;   in a shipping box (which you can get for free from the usps website)<br/>\n&gt;   and put it on the bathroom scale.  Then I go to the usps website and<br/>\n&gt;   calculate the postage from my zip code to any other zip code (usually<br/>\n&gt;   I use a zip code that is farthest from me).  That&#39;s the postage that I<br/>\n&gt;   list on ebay.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   I have seen some listings (and have done the same things on some of my<br/>\n&gt;   auctions) where they just say that they will give a quote on postage<br/>\n&gt;   if someone emails them.  Then you can weigh the item and give them the<br/>\n&gt;   exact cost of shipping.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Hope this helps and good luck (we&#39;ve made quite a bit of extra money<br/>\n&gt;   in this way)<br/>\n&gt;   Melissa<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Have A Nice Day!<br/>\n&gt;   &lt;litlrooh@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   &gt; Do any of you guys ever sell stuff on ebay?

What I usually do is try to find out how<br/>\nmuch something weighs (since that&#39;s the way that the post office<br/>\ncalculates postage).  I used to have a post office across the street<br/>\nfrom me with a scale so it was easy.  Now, I package what I&#39;m selling<br/>\nin a shipping box (which you can get for free from the usps website)<br/>\nand put it on the bathroom scale.  Then I go to the usps website and<br/>\ncalculate the postage from my zip code to any other zip code (usually<br/>\nI use a zip code that is farthest from me).  That&#39;s the postage that I<br/>\nlist on ebay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen some listings (and have done the same things on some of my<br/>\nauctions) where they just say that they will give a quote on postage<br/>\nif someone emails them.  Then you can weigh the item and give them the<br/>\nexact cost of shipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps and good luck (we&#39;ve made quite a bit of extra money<br/>\nin this way)<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Have A Nice Day!<br/>\n&lt;litlrooh@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do any of you guys ever sell stuff on ebay?
