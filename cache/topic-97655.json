Barbara Sher, author of Wishcraft and other books, and PBS Pledge time <br/>\nstar, is doing her workshop especially for us. In addition, because she is so <br/>\nintrigued by Unschoolers, she is staying for the WHOLE conference! (She usually <br/>\njusy goes into towns for the day.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The World Premiere of Stirling, a comedy-mystery feature-length movie <br/>\nwritten, produced, directed by, and starring homeschooled teens. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. True Story Theater will take our experiences and ideas and turn them into <br/>\na performace for us.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Amazing speakers like Sandra Dodd, Anne Ohman, Pam Laricchia, Ben Lovejoy, <br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Really cool stuff in goodie bags for attendees.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. The Talent Show! Unschoolers are a talented bunch!<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Late Night Rooms for Folks who can&#39;t get enough! There will be two program <br/>\nrooms open until 3 AM (when the Security guy goes home) -- one for adults <br/>\n(and kids with them) and one for Teens.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Concert by Robin Blair (Followed the next morning by a Funshop.)<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Still some space in a whale watch with lots of cool unschoolers, at an <br/>\nastonishing price.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Come see how Julian&#39;s chainmaille shirt came out, and try it on.<br/>\n<br/>\n11.
