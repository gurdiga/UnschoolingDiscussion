But she had little interest in it, and it was a hard time for both of us, with alot of yelling and hurt feelings as I didn&#39;t feel she was really trying and would be upset with her.  So in some ways while she had the technical knowledge of reading, it&#39;s only been in the past couple months, at 7 1/2 that she&#39;s really wanting to read on her own and enjoying it, asking for books to read from the library, etc. So you could consider her truly reading at 7 1/2 although she&#39;s had the technical knowledge and ability to &#39;read&#39; since she was 6 1/2. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\nMary &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I would like to hear how old each of your children were when it the<br/>\nreading<br/>\nclick for them...I think that would help with reassurance for myself &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTara was reading at 6 but she was a school child since she was 4.

It drove me kind of nuts.  One thing I did was to get some books on tape (it worked for him because he&#39;s very verbal/audio oriented, I can&#39;t listen to the things, though), and to sometimes turn the table and ask him to &quot;read&quot; to me while I did housework or some sort of errand.  I also tried to get him to make up stories of his own, and I would write them down for him and make little books that he would then &quot;read&quot; to himself.

Surprisingly, he<br/>\n&gt; reappears in this forum so soon!   He had two much brothers 12, 14 years<br/>\n&gt; younger.  When they were little he and the mom and other kids had been in<br/>\n&gt; India while the dad was in Toronto studying physics.    He said the babies<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t wear diapers, just little kurtas, the long white shirts.   In India<br/>\n&gt; they have floor-hole toilets, and he said the mom taught the little guys<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; poop by squatting or sitting and making a little potty-seat with her feet,<br/>\n&gt; like heels together, feet arched, toes together, outsides of feet toward<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; floor, and setting the baby on her feet and the baby would poop and then<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;d flush it (if it was in the toilet) or just clean it up (if it had<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; on the ground, or on paper or whatever--that I wasn&#39;t clear on).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He was just noting that the little potty-chairs Americans use are not<br/>\n&gt; efficient for helping babies poop because squatting is the way anyway,<br/>\nknees<br/>\n&gt; up, butt down.  He was pre-med and ended up going off elsewhere and<br/>\nbecoming<br/>\n&gt; a doctor, and he was interested in some of the dumb things Americans<br/>\nthought<br/>\n&gt; were good and right, like chair-style toilets.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I still remember the first time I passed by and saw him squatted up on the<br/>\n&gt; toilet seat, reading a magazine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And even now, sometimes if I&#39;m having a difficult time pooping I squat and<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; really does  help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This clever friend said we would have WAY fewer health problems if we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; strain ourselves to try to push poop out with muscles which weren&#39;t<br/>\nintended<br/>\n&gt; for that, and if we&#39;d use the natural position all would be better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles\">http://expage.com/SandraDoddArticles</a><br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expage.com/SandraDodd\">http://expage.com/SandraDodd</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Aug 2001 08:46:16 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: stuff<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 8/14/01 3:48:59 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffersonacademy@...\">jeffersonacademy@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; She found it when she<br/>\n&gt; got up from her nap and came running down the hall<br/>\n&gt; yelling &quot;Santa came!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know that feeling myself.

I assign the land you sojourn in to you and<br/>\nyour<br/>\n&gt; offspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n&gt; be their God. . . . Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your<br/>\n&gt; offspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be<br/>\n&gt; circumcised. (Genesis 17:6,8,10)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Over the centuries there has been much written by Jewish scholars about<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; importance of circumcision. Support for circumcision in the Jewish<br/>\ncommunity<br/>\n&gt; today is widespread. There is another perspective on circumcision that is<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; openly discussed. Contrary to common belief, circumcision has not always<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n&gt; practiced. Moses failed to circumcise his son (Exodus 4:25), and<br/>\ncircumcision<br/>\n&gt; was totally neglected during the forty-year period in the wilderness<br/>\n(Joshua<br/>\n&gt; 5:5). Some Jews in the Hellenistic period (circa 300 b.c.e.-100 c.e.)<br/>\nchose<br/>\n&gt; not to circumcise their sons in an attempt to gain public acceptance.1<br/>\nDuring<br/>\n&gt; the Reform movement in Germany in the 1840s, some parents did not<br/>\ncircumcise<br/>\n&gt; their sons. Theodor Herzl was one of the most prominent figures who did<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; circumcise his son, who was born in 1891.2<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Currently, circumcision is not universal among Jews either inside or<br/>\noutside<br/>\n&gt; the United States. The Circumcision Resource Center, a nonprofit<br/>\neducational<br/>\n&gt; organization, knows of hundreds of Jews in Europe, South America, and in<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; United States who either have not or would not circumcise a son. Even in<br/>\n&gt; Israel some Jews do not circumcise, and there is an organization that<br/>\n&gt; publicly opposes circumcision.3 The purpose of this article is to<br/>\ncoherently<br/>\n&gt; explain a few of the contemporary reasons for the increasing doubts some<br/>\nJews<br/>\n&gt; have about circumcision. Then I will apply Torah law and Jewish values to<br/>\n&gt; these reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 9<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Aug 2001 08:35:31 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Saga&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mom@...\">mom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: Squatting the natural way (was NO diapers!- was:Foreskin)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;This clever friend said we would have WAY fewer health problems if we<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; strain ourselves to try to push poop out with muscles which weren&#39;t<br/>\nintended<br/>\n&gt; for that, and if we&#39;d use the natural position all would be better.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I had read in one of the Bradley Method books that hemmorhoids are<br/>\nbasically<br/>\n&gt; unheard of in countries that squat instead of using a toilet like ours.<br/>\n&gt; There was reference to an Indian doctor who would perch up on the toilet<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; squat.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Kristi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 15 Aug 2001 08:35:31 -0700<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Saga&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mom@...\">mom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE: NO diapers!- was:Foreskin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK, now I&#39;ve got to try this with my daughter, she&#39;s 9 months old.<br/>\n&gt; I thought I was doing so much good for using cloth diapers... figured my<br/>\nson<br/>\n&gt; would potty train early because suppsedly cloth diapered babies do... but<br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; son refuses to use a toilet for bms and still is completely surprised when<br/>\n&gt; he wets himself.<br/>\n&gt; Oh well, maybe they&#39;ll &quot;train&quot; together :)  That would be great!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: jefferson academy [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffersonacademy@...\">jeffersonacademy@...</a>]<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, August 15, 2001 3:09 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] NO diapers!- was:Foreskin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cen46624@...\">cen46624@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; True, Bronwen.

The words on all the<br/>\n&gt; objects in your house is a good idea.  A word wall is<br/>\n&gt; another - a wall with pictures of objects with the<br/>\n&gt; name of the object on the card.  Some children learn<br/>\n&gt; by writing to read. Since she can print you could help<br/>\n&gt; her to write her own stories by spelling them for her.<br/>\n&gt;  Some children are more sight readers and would be<br/>\n&gt; helped by having the same few books read over and<br/>\n&gt; over. She&#39;ll soon &#39;read&#39; it from memory.  Some kids<br/>\n&gt; like to play a game with flash cards where you show<br/>\n&gt; them a letter and if they can think of a word that<br/>\n&gt; starts with that sound they win the card.  You can<br/>\n&gt; play a game of saying words like &#39;lighthouse&#39; and see<br/>\n&gt; if she can break it into light and house (this helps<br/>\n&gt; with auditory segmentation.) You can play a sound game<br/>\n&gt; by saying &quot;/c/ /a/ /t/ - what word is that?&quot; to help<br/>\n&gt; with auditory blending (both necessary skills for<br/>\n&gt; reading development.

It might be helpful for you to<br/>\ncompletely scrap any sort of phonics- based learning for him in an effort<br/>\nto prevent further frustration.  You want to  preserve a love of reading<br/>\nat any cost, since it will be helpful to him in the future and he truly<br/>\nwants to read.  Perhaps you might try  backing off of any formal<br/>\ninstruction whatsoever and focus on relaxed reading activities such as<br/>\nreading aloud, drawing pictures (which is how writing begins), and<br/>\nletting him dictate stories to you which you write or type and make into<br/>\nbooks, etc.  If he expresses anxiety at not knowing how to read, explain<br/>\nthat this is how reading begins, and he will certainly learn in time. <br/>\nSome other activities he may enjoy include: <br/>\n   -  labeling things or parts of a room (let him choose words)<br/>\n  -  identifying words or phrases that appeal to him and hanging them up<br/>\n  -  starting a word bank<br/>\n   -reading, reading, reading books of his own choosing<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many books on learning styles and learning to read, and so<br/>\nmany ways to teach children to read.  Since there are seven kinds of<br/>\nintelligence and schools measure only two (one of which is phonics/<br/>\nvisual based), don&#39;t be at all surprised if your son does not fit the<br/>\ntypical mold.  As a reading teacher I have seen so many children with<br/>\nreading &#39;difficulties&#39; which turned out not to be difficulties at all, <br/>\nbut only  alternative learning styles. Assure him that everything will be<br/>\nfine, and  let him choose his own path so that he will always be in<br/>\ncontrol of the process.  You sound like a wonderful, supportive parent<br/>\nand your boys are so lucky to have you!!  Remember that Grant Colfax of <br/>\n&#39;Homeschooling for Excellence&#39; (who went on to Harvard), didn&#39;t learn to<br/>\nread until he was nine years old!  <br/>\n     Best of Luck!!
