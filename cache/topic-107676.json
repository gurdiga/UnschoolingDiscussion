DS, after so many incidents<br/>\nin which his father won&#39;t take no for an answer to a command, has an<br/>\nimmediate and sometimes frighteningly intense reaction to some<br/>\nrequests, especially if he&#39;s upset for any other reason, hungry,<br/>\ntired, frustratedso he&#39;ll lash out in a way that seems out of<br/>\nproportion, and sometimes uncalled for (like yelling &quot;leave me alone&quot;<br/>\nwhen dh asks him if he wants something to drink). In the ensuing<br/>\nmelee, if I don&#39;t respond to dh&#39;s need to not be screamed at, etc.,<br/>\nthen I can&#39;t really help defuse the situation because now he&#39;s upset<br/>\nwith me too. I was having a really hard time with this for a couple<br/>\nmonths earlier this year, combined with the stresses of money and<br/>\ngetting ready to move across the country.

Ds is 9 years old, and both ds and dh <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt; spirited (aside: thank you Mary Kurcinka-&quot;spirited&quot; is a much <br/>\n&gt;better<br/>\n&gt; word than others I have heard people use to describe my dear <br/>\n&gt;ones!),<br/>\n&gt; and as Deb said, once they lock in on opposite sides, it&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; difficult to get either one of them to cede.

I agree <br/>\nwith you - I don&#39;t stand aside and let it be a knock down dragged <br/>\nout situation. I&#39;ll use my &quot;equal status&quot; as an adult to help <br/>\nDH &quot;hear&quot; what DS is saying or needing. I&#39;ll draw DH up short and <br/>\nget him to stop and think a minute if whatever it is is a hill he <br/>\nwants to die on. I also make sure to mirror DH&#39;s feelings and words <br/>\nback to him so he feels that he is being heard, that his own needs <br/>\nare being included. Then I&#39;ll use my calm Mommy self and draw DS to <br/>\nme (physical contact often, not always, but often enough, really <br/>\nhelps DS when he&#39;s frustrated) and hear him out, reflect back his <br/>\nwords and emotions so he knows I&#39;m getting it. Then we brainstorm <br/>\ntogether to resolve the situation. Oh, and just to make things <br/>\nclear, I don&#39;t always talk to DH first and DS second. Over time, <br/>\nthey are getting better at listening and hearing each other, taking <br/>\na breath, and trying to find a solution. Generally, it&#39;s when one or <br/>\nthe other is running low on &#39;fuel&#39; (personal, mental, physical <br/>\nenergy - not necessarily food needs, sometimes DH needs some space, <br/>\nsometimes DS needs to burn pent up energy, whatever) that things get <br/>\nsticky. At those times, DH falls back on what he heard growing up <br/>\n(parents tell, kids do, no questions, all expectations). It really <br/>\nreally helped when we went over the Spirited checklist and <br/>\ndiscovered DH is Spirited too - I can frame things as &quot;when you were <br/>\na Spirited little boy, how would you have felt in this situation? <br/>\nwhat would you have wanted to happen?&quot; One important piece to this <br/>\nis that *someone* has to stay sane. So, if I let myself get hungry <br/>\nor run down, it can get really nuts. DH and I joke that only one of <br/>\nus is allowed to be crazy at a time. Of course, sometimes I&#39;m tired <br/>\nand frustrated from work or whatever and easily irritated.

Lots of the situations","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1468465860\">We have the same situation as Deb and &quot;salamander starr&quot;dh and ds are<br/>\nboth so intense and their confrontations are equally intense. Lots of<br/>\nthe situations in our house arise from ds&#39;s (9) sense that he is being<br/>\ntreated with less respect than he is &quot;supposed&quot; to afford dh. So for<br/>\nexample, dh expects ds to ask nicely if he wants something, and<br/>\nquietly accept it if dh can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) do whatever it isbut dh<br/>\nexpects ds to jump up and do what he&#39;s told (not even asked) asap. We<br/>\nhad a big family discussion about this the other day, where finally dh<br/>\nlistened to ds&#39;s request that dh at least say &quot;please&quot;. But really,<br/>\nthis usually just means that dh says please, but ds is not allowed to<br/>\nsay no. So, in this situation, I have been talking to dh about this<br/>\nwhen we have a little quiet time alone. I have pointed out how I think<br/>\nthat dh falls into a way of treating children without thinking, that<br/>\nis very typical in Bolivia, where he is fromon the one hand, many<br/>\nchildren are allowed time and space to play, and are not<br/>\nover-programmed or supervised, but they are also expected to drop<br/>\nwhatever it is that they&#39;re doing and come running if an adult calls<br/>\nthem, and often it&#39;s for stupid things like the adult is too busy<br/>\ntalking to bring his/her own glass into the kitchen to be washed.<br/>\nDrives me nuts whenever we&#39;re there! So pointing this cultural<br/>\ndifference out has been fruitful, up until the other day when dh sort<br/>\nof half-heartedly tried to justify his  behavior by saying it was<br/>\nculturally relative. (Plus, is it so different from the way children<br/>\nare treated here, at the core of it?) Couldn&#39;t let that one by, so I<br/>\never so sweetly asked him to explain to me why it was fine to treat<br/>\nchildren like lesser beings, and that might does not make right,<br/>\nperiod. This point is slowly coming along for dh, so I have to<br/>\ncelebrate every small step<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that giving dh the same understanding that I give the kids<br/>\nis important, i.e. is he tired, stressed, hungry and so does that<br/>\nexplain why he&#39;s doing this particular thing he&#39;s doing. I have also<br/>\nfound that it is very important that I let him know what&#39;s going on<br/>\nvis-à-vis our evolving unschooling life. For a while there, I was not<br/>\ncommunicating with dh very well at all, about unschooling and living<br/>\nby principles, so to him my changing behavior felt like an imposition<br/>\non our once &quot;good-enough&quot; family life. Of course, that had to change,<br/>\nand finding time alone to talk was crucial. Usually it was in our<br/>\nfamily bed, once everyone else had fallen asleep, or sometimes 9yo ds<br/>\nwould still be awake, but downstairs playing or watching tvwe&#39;ve had<br/>\nthe best conversations in the dark in the middle of the night. (It<br/>\nmakes me think of Sandra&#39;s essay about leaning on a truck, i.e. having<br/>\na conversation without the intense eye contact can be better<br/>\nsometimes). So one important point for us: keeping dh in the loop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, in the heat of the moment, during those<br/>\nconfrontations between ds and dh, I cannot stand aside, and bide my<br/>\ntime to talk about it later. Ds is 9 years old, and both ds and dh are<br/>\nspirited (aside: thank you Mary Kurcinka-&quot;spirited&quot; is a much better<br/>\nword than others I have heard people use to describe my dear ones!),<br/>\nand as Deb said, once they lock in on opposite sides, it&#39;s very<br/>\ndifficult to get either one of them to cede. Here&#39;s where I differ<br/>\nfrom Deb (or maybe not, I don&#39;t think she addressed what she does in<br/>\nthe moment)at these times, I do NOT give my dh the same consideration<br/>\nif it means that I have to stand back and let the two of them go at<br/>\nit, because when it comes right down to it, there is a power imbalance<br/>\nin the parent/child relationship in our society, and this plays out in<br/>\nthe microcosm of my husband&#39;s relationship with my son. I will not let<br/>\ndh assert this society-granted power over ds if I can help it. Dh IS<br/>\nthe adult in the relationship and so HE is the one who needs to figure<br/>\nout how to recognise his emotions and not lash out, and recognize that<br/>\nlittle people deserve as much consideration as big people, so as to be<br/>\nable to help ds learn to do the same. Dh falls back on the<br/>\nauthoritarian way that he was parentedor worsebecause he was cared<br/>\nfor a significant amount by his older siblings (he&#39;s the youngest of<br/>\n13, and his mom was ill when he was little, dad busy working)in my<br/>\nopinion, and dh agrees with me, the relationship between dh and ds<br/>\nsometimes resembles a sibling relationship more than a parent/child<br/>\nrelationshipI hear the voices of dh&#39;s siblings coming through in the<br/>\nway he treats ds sometimes (not all the time, and in fairness to dh,<br/>\nhe has gotten so much better!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure that we are a family in transition, and for me this means<br/>\nthat while we are figuring out unschooling and better parenting and<br/>\nall, I need to be particularly aware of what&#39;s happening in the<br/>\nrelationships in our houseif I sense that dh and ds are escalating<br/>\ntoward a &quot;lock-in&quot;, I try to intervene right away. It&#39;s the only way<br/>\nI&#39;ve found to keep the peace. And if I can&#39;t defuse it, then I stand<br/>\nin between them (sometimes literally). When I first started doing<br/>\nthis, it caused a lot of problems between dh and me, he said I was<br/>\nbeing ds&#39;s &quot;lawyer&quot; (how&#39;s that for an adversarial metaphor), and that<br/>\nI was undermining the relationship between them (and us). So we talked<br/>\nabout it, a lot, and sometimes yelled and cried. And I explained that<br/>\nin my humble opinion, it was dh&#39;s authoritarian attitude that was<br/>\nundermining his relationship with ds. And I pointed out to him that at<br/>\nother times, he really admires ds&#39;s independent spirit and refusal to<br/>\nbow to authority for authority&#39;s sake. These conversations, removed<br/>\nfrom the moment, are helping. I&#39;m getting better at being aware of<br/>\nwhether everyone&#39;s needs are being met, and heading off<br/>\nconfrontations. Dh is coming around, though it feels like two steps<br/>\nforward, one step back. But at least we&#39;re on the path.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I&#39;m so looking forward to our first Live and Learn conference,<br/>\nand from the way I&#39;ve heard people talk about it, I&#39;m expecting to<br/>\nhear the sound of trumpets and a bright light as dh is magically<br/>\ntransformed into the ideal unschooling/respectful parenting dad.

[removing it from the heat of the moment <br/>\nhelps keep it from boiling over] Mostly, situations occur when DH is <br/>\nnot actually -thinking- but rather what comes out is the same tape <br/>\nthat he heard growing up, the same expectation, the same types of <br/>\nphrases, etc. One of the *biggest* things that has helped is helping <br/>\nDH to see how much alike the two of them are (they are amazingly <br/>\nalike right down to the shape of their ear lobes lol). Then, taking <br/>\nthat a step further and helping DH to recognize how he felt as a <br/>\nchild. And, for me to recognize that often I am gentle with DS but <br/>\n*expect* DH to be at the same place I am in many areas and I&#39;m not <br/>\nalways so gentle with him because &quot;he&#39;s a grownup&quot;. During one <br/>\nparticularly bumpy time, DH and I were having a long late night <br/>\ntalk, and he started crying because he realized he was actually kind <br/>\nof envious of DS&#39; freedom, freedom and respect he wishes he had <br/>\nreceived when he was a kid. We&#39;ve got lots of little bits of things <br/>\nwe do - something as simple as me calling DH a couple times per day <br/>\nso he can hear a grownup voice and get a little &#39;pick me up&#39; and an <br/>\near to bounce situations off of. I usually talk to DS too when I <br/>\ncall. And both of them can call me at work as needed. We have my <br/>\nwork number (right down to the extension) on the speed dial so DS <br/>\n(he&#39;s 7) can call easily. Both of them are Spirited personalities <br/>\nand tend to lock in to a particular opinion/idea/plan - makes for <br/>\nvery determined, dedicated, focused people but can be a bit sticky <br/>\nif they each lock in to an opposite idea. So, I&#39;ll talk to DH, I&#39;ll <br/>\ntalk to DS, we&#39;ll brainstorm ideas, and eventually DS merrily heads <br/>\noff to propose a plan to DH. (arranged that way so DS doesn&#39;t <br/>\nperceive it as being told what to do - it&#39;s usually something that <br/>\nis within the realm of okay that DH and I have discussed).

They just provide a great entry into using good communication<br/>\nand problem-solving with kids.  They don&#39;t reach the level of<br/>\nrespectful parenting, though -- often the problem that they&#39;re solving<br/>\nis how to get the kid beyond the fact that they can&#39;t have cookie<br/>\nright now, or something ridiculous like that.  But the skills<br/>\nthemselves are the useful part.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also liked _Parent/Teen Breakthrough:  A Relationship Approach_.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have teens yet but I read it anyway and learned a lot.  It<br/>\nstarts with the premise that parents really cannot control their<br/>\nteens, and they better come to terms with that fact.  I thought that<br/>\nwas a nice wake-up call to mainstream parenting thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jenneferh2000","from":"&quot;jenneferh2000&quot; &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: book recommendations/reviews","postDate":"1123136570","msgId":107676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRjc2M3cStyMmhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":107677,"prevInTime":107675,"nextInTime":107677,"topicId":107676,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi~ I m a little behind on emails and just read this one.

Don&#39;t remember<br/>\nseeing any replies- unless I missed them.  I too would be interested<br/>\nin other&#39;s book recommendations.  Scrolling down I see you mentioned<br/>\nThe Pearls &quot;No Greater Joy&quot; newsletter.  Oh yuck!  You are pretty bold<br/>\nto actually subscribe, let alone read it!  Would be a number 1 on my<br/>\nDO NOT RECOMMEND list.  Ha!  I was the one from Eugene, Oregon who<br/>\ninquired about their presence when they came to town.  I ended up<br/>\nattending the speach with the thought that I&#39;d take advantage of open<br/>\nquestion and answer time.  Which they did not have!  Afterwards, you<br/>\ncould come up on stage and personally ask Micheal Pearl questions. <br/>\nYeah, right, like I was going to do that!  He&#39;d probably wack me.  It<br/>\nwas definately an eye opener.  Let me tell you- the church was packed.<br/>\n There was standing room only and people were standing outside<br/>\nlistening through the open window.  People were parked up on the<br/>\ngrass.  Everyone was dressed nice, smiling, laughing and nodding and<br/>\nthey brought all their children, including small ones who sat there<br/>\nsilently through the whole thing, not moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, one book I recently have read is Sophie&#39;s World- a history of<br/>\nphilosophy written by a Norweigan man whose name is slipping my mind<br/>\nright now.  It is written for a 14 year girl and is basically an<br/>\nexchange of letters and dialogues between this girl and a man who is<br/>\ntelling her the history of philosophy.  I really enjoyed it, and it<br/>\nwas a great, simple with complex ideas, refreshener.  It is not really<br/>\nabout parenting or anything like that, but it is about life and how we<br/>\nexperience and understand it.  It really changed my outlook<br/>\nafterwards.  I felt like I had more tolerance of very religious<br/>\npeople. I highly recommend it for adults and middle aged to older<br/>\nchildren.

In googling<br/>\naround we came across OBO and got it from the library.  It&#39;s written<br/>\nfrom an anthropology/socio-biology perspective, and explores<br/>\ninfant/toddler care across cultures.  I spent lots of time feeling<br/>\nannoyed by it, but it made me consider all sorts of stuff that I hadn&#39;t<br/>\nthought of before, and had a huge long term impact on the range of<br/>\noptions we could see in how to relate to our child.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Child&#39;s Work&quot; by Nancy Wallace<br/>\nI read this a few years before my wife and I were even thinking about<br/>\nhaving children.  At the time it felt fairly radical to me, although<br/>\nafter reading this list for awhile it might feel pretty &quot;school at<br/>\nhome&quot;ish.  Although I did OK from an academic perspective I never<br/>\nenjoyed or felt safe in school.  Reading the Wallace&#39;s account of doing<br/>\nit differently got me to really consider, for the first time in my <br/>\nlife,<br/>\nhow one might get away from the structural problems built into our<br/>\nconcept of school.  It brought up lots of strong emotions from my time<br/>\nin school, and got me crying many times reading it and seeing for the<br/>\nfirst time practical solutions to the pain that school was causing for<br/>\nsomeones child.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn<br/>\nI think something on this list made me look up Alfie Kohn, and after<br/>\nreading a few of the articles on his website I got this book from the<br/>\nlibrary.  It&#39;s too long, both in just using too many words to say most<br/>\nthings, and in repeating itself alot in different sections, but has <br/>\nbeen<br/>\ngreat to read regardless.  As I mentioned in another post recently, <br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\nmostly a critique of behaviorist inspired methods of interacting with<br/>\npeople, with the focus on the problems with positive reinforcement<br/>\n(since punishment is just too easy a target?)  He cites *lots* of<br/>\nresearch in this, and I haven&#39;t gotten down to reading any of it yet,<br/>\nalthough I would like to.  It&#39;s helped me think about how to structure<br/>\nresponses to friends/family that are more skeptical of the more<br/>\nnon-traditional directions we want to go as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; by John Gatto<br/>\nI also read this when I was closer to being in the school system than<br/>\nthe parent of someone in it.  Gatto strikes me as a bit strident at<br/>\ntimes, but it also helped me to see the more &quot;medium is the message&quot;<br/>\nproblem with school at a time when I was waffling more about it.<br/>\nReading Gatto is sort of like reading the works of a religious convert;<br/>\nhe spent so much time as a &quot;model&quot; teacher, and clearly now looks back<br/>\non it with shame and horror.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No Greater Joy&quot; newsletter by the Pearls<br/>\nMany months ago, when the Pearls were going to be giving a seminar in<br/>\nEugene Oregon, I saw a post by someone asking for advice with <br/>\nstrategies<br/>\nfor making their displeasure known.  (The Pearls advocate *extremely*<br/>\ncontrolling and conservative parenting from a rigid religious<br/>\nperspective, lots of spanking and guilt and molding of blank slates.)  <br/>\nI<br/>\nfound their website while looking for more info, and saw that you can<br/>\nsubscribe to the newsletter for free.  It&#39;s been a disturbing and<br/>\nenlightening sort of &quot;how the other half lives&quot; view (although I kind <br/>\nof<br/>\nworry what our mail carrier will think of us!)  What&#39;s been hardest for<br/>\nme is seeing how clearly the people writing for it are motivated by the<br/>\ndesire to do the right thing for their children.  Don&#39;t get it if you<br/>\nhave high blood pressure ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Finite and Infinite Games&quot; by James Carse<br/>\nI liked this one better when I was younger; I just re-read it and it<br/>\nseems like it has lots more holes in it&#39;s reasoning and is more reliant<br/>\non cute/clever turns of phrase than when I read it the first time.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s<br/>\nnot really about education or parenting except insofar as it&#39;s sort of<br/>\nall about intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, power dynamics, and why<br/>\nand how one chooses to live life.  But it is kinda fun, and might give<br/>\nyou a new way to look at things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen people recommend &quot;How To Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So<br/>\nKids Will Talk&quot; and &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; on the list before.  Any<br/>\ncomments on what made you like them?  Other book/author <br/>\nrecommendations?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n-emile</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107864,"nextTopicId":107865}}
