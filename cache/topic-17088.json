Just thought I would let you all<br/>\nknow that the rain and snow did hold off and we were<br/>\nable to get the bonfire lit.  All went very well.  We<br/>\nate roasted hot-dogs  till we could have popped.  We<br/>\ndid roast the marshmallows inside on candles though,<br/>\n(that was a terrific idea).  We played many games and<br/>\nall was a success.  We did have to answer a lot of<br/>\nquestions from all of our ps friends.  They were all<br/>\nvery interested in what we are doing!!  My boys were<br/>\nvery proud to have the opportunity to show off their<br/>\nwork and projects.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nKim - Missouri MOM of Dylan(10) Jacob(10) Noah(20 mos)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
