We had a flock last year.  I LOVE ducks, if only they wouldn&#39;t poop EVERWHERE!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey used to come over to our sliding glass door and hide in a little corner together.  It was cute bec. they had imprinted on us and wanted to come in the house with us.  But the POOP was unreal!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, our resident duck patient is still alive, and flapped his wings today, so I know his wings and legs are ok.  But he is still very off balance.  He can bear weight on both legs but he leans too far to one side.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing his balance problem is the head injury (his face was a bit bloody) or internal injuries (like ribs or something).  Since he has an appropriate fear and eats and drinks, etc.  I am hoping its more internal stuff that will heal over time.  Then we can release him.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CelticFrau@...\">CelticFrau@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, June 08, 2003 8:36 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: Our newest family member: was Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 6/8/2003 4:15:35 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:litlrooh@...\">litlrooh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; What a cute thing he is too.

When the time comes that she is ready to completely care for an<br/>\n  animal,<br/>\n  &gt; she will do it.  Without pushing and prodding.  Without suggestion.  And<br/>\n  &gt; without making promises she isn&#39;t prepared to keep.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really appreciate your comments.  It certainly is my problem.  The kids<br/>\n  are happy with having the pets here when they are interested and paying no<br/>\n  attention at other times.  I&#39;m the one who is bothered.  What is the point<br/>\n  of having a pet if all we do is give it food?  Why do we have it unless we<br/>\n  do want to spend time with it?  I could certainly find other things to keep<br/>\n  in the space that is currently occupied by pets and their trappings, not to<br/>\n  mention other things to do besides clean cages! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  It relates to parts of the unschooling process that I still haven&#39;t figured<br/>\n  out.  There are only so many hours in a day, only so many square feet in a<br/>\n  house, and only so much money available.  How do we decide where to allocate<br/>\n  those resources to best support our children?<br/>\n<br/>\n  When a child says they want a pet (or shows an interest in something) do we<br/>\n  rush out and get it?  Or do we wait until they&#39;ve indicated that they<br/>\n  really, really, really want it?  How can we tell how much they want it?<br/>\n  Where is the line between the unschooling parent who supports all the kids&#39;<br/>\n  interests and the one who doesn&#39;t do enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my children<br/>\n  will give me clues.  Still, I could use some guidance from some of you<br/>\n  experts out there :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Mary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
