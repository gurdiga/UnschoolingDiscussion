I know exactly what you <br/>\nmean about you and your son being so free and having so much fun, and him at <br/>\nwork, hating it.  That is so much like us.  When we talked the other night, <br/>\nhe said he sometimes wished we could put them in school so that he and I <br/>\ncould have a day off.  Maybe we need to hire a babysitter instead.  I am <br/>\nactually working now, three nights a week, aiting tables, which I like (free <br/>\nfood is nice too!), and that helps to take the pressure off.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-956931650\">Hi Rachael,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re talking more overall stress than burnout.  Either way, <br/>\n it&#39;s no fun.  Life is a <br/>\nbalancing act and unschooling is no different.  I know many families <br/>\nwhere both parents work and they homeschool.  It involves some <br/>\ncreativity and juggling,  but it can work and work well.  A lot of <br/>\nunschooling families seem to gravitate towards working at home or <br/>\nowning their own businesses.  That makes it a little easier to mesh <br/>\nthe unschooling lifestyle with work,  but it isn&#39;t possible for <br/>\neveryone.  Now,  that said,  I personally have not worked and <br/>\nhomeschooled.   I worked part-time when my kids were little and again <br/>\nwhen they were both in school.  What I discovered is that I am just <br/>\nnot very good at juggling my time and energy.  I get very involved in work and <br/>\nneglect my family or visa versa.  I admire people who do it.  I&#39;m <br/>\njust not very good at it, and I accept that it&#39;s not one of my <br/>\nstrengths.  Sometimes it&#39;s tempting when things are tight <br/>\nfinancially,  but I usually find another way out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as unschooling and working in the schooled world - my husband <br/>\ndoes this every day.  He&#39;s a college professor.  Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>\nfrustrating for him,  but I think his students have benefitted from <br/>\nour unschooling.  He knows so much more about learning styles and <br/>\nunderstands why some kids are so unprepared for college.  He&#39;s doing <br/>\nhis part to try to make some changes.  The politics sometimes make it <br/>\nhard,  but he tries to remember why he&#39;s there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to try some different solutions and see what works.  <br/>\nUnschooling shows us that there is more than one way to solve a <br/>\nproblem and that it&#39;s okay to start down one path and then veer over <br/>\nonto another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane from KS<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3033,"nextTopicId":3036}}
