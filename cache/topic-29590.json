I do school-at-home, but for many aspects of the<br/>\n&gt; curriculum I chose, my daughter is bored and I feel if I would have to<br/>\n&gt; force her to continue, which I don&#39;t want to do.  Unschooling is a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;theory&quot; that intrigues me, but what is a typical day, week like for<br/>\n&gt; someone this young.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t one. :) I know that&#39;s not wildly helpful, but it&#39;s truthful.<br/>\nUnschooling &quot;typically&quot; looks like a child doing exactly whatever it is she<br/>\nloves to do. Depending on the child and on any given hour of any given day,<br/>\nthis may &quot;typically&quot; look like sleeping, cooking, walking, playing, watching<br/>\ntv, playing games, talking to her grandfather, asking questions about God<br/>\nand why cats wash with their tongues, or, yes, doing math worksheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert Frost actually said it best:<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly where love and need are one<br/>\nand the work is play for mortal stakes<br/>\nIs the deed ever truly done<br/>\nfor Heaven&#39;s and the future&#39;s sakes<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She is too young to do her own research or plan<br/>\n&gt; activities around her interests.  I also have two younger children, so<br/>\n&gt; the preplanned curriculum is helpful to me on those days the other<br/>\n&gt; children are needing more of my time and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling actually fits in very well with multi-children households. And<br/>\nyour daughter is doing her own research and planning activities around her<br/>\ninterests all the time: every time she plays dress-up, watches something on<br/>\nTV, picks out a book, or asks you questions, she&#39;s doing her own research<br/>\nand planning her own activities. :) Trust her, the kid&#39;s good, she knows<br/>\nwhat she wants right now, and what she wants is exactly what she needs to<br/>\nlearn about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know a few homeschoolers, but no unschoolers.
