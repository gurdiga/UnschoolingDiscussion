And people don&#39;t &quot;excuse themselves,&quot; but as Ren <br/>\nstated, they ask to be excused.  &quot;Excuse me&quot; is short for &quot;will you excuse me?&quot;  The <br/>\nfact that most people don&#39;t respond any more, it&#39;s leftover from more formal <br/>\ntimes when rank and hostess&#39; position had obligations which are fading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did ask a guest kid not to chew with his mouth open the other day.  Chips, <br/>\nwhile watching Marty play video games. Crunch, smack, crunch.  I was in there <br/>\nfolding laundry and I&#39;m as unused to smacking as I am to people lighting up <br/>\ncigarettes in my house (that hasn&#39;t happened for twenty years), and I finally <br/>\nasked him please to chew with his mouth closed because the noise really bothered <br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] manners","postDate":"1055028917","msgId":72818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWMzMmQ0ZCQ3M2Y4NzNlMCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE3MC4xZjlhODRlOC4yYzEzYzVhZEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72812,"nextInTopic":72846,"prevInTime":72817,"nextInTime":72819,"topicId":72812,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2112986953\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I know this wasn&#39;t the point of the post in which the question was raised<br/>\nabout rude kids....but I couldn&#39;t help but notice this statement.<br/>\nI can&#39;t STAND it when kids are expected to ASK to get up from the table.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think of children having to ask to be excused I have a picture of a<br/>\nvery religious farming family. Those that have children that sit very<br/>\nquietly at the table and say nothing unless they are spoken to. If anything<br/>\nis said at all  it comes from the father. A very submissive picture, like<br/>\nthe kids and wife get beat. Sorry, but I guess I picked that up from TV<br/>\nsomewhere as I never knew anyone who had to ask to leave the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids say, I&#39;m done and I say okay and off they go. Once in awhile if it&#39;s<br/>\na sit down dinner for an occasion, (seems like that&#39;s the only time we have<br/>\nthem anymore) I&#39;ll ask whoever is ready to leave first (that would be<br/>\nJoseph) to hang out with us for a few minutes. I find Alyssa doesn&#39;t eat<br/>\nlike she wants to if the other kids run off.  When she&#39;s done, then Joseph<br/>\nand her can both go. Sierra will only leave when she&#39;s had enough. That<br/>\ncould usually be quite awhile!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"manners","postDate":"1055026093","msgId":72812,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC4xZjlhODRlOC4yYzEzYzVhZEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72818,"prevInTime":72811,"nextInTime":72813,"topicId":72812,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sit back down please, and excuse yourself.
