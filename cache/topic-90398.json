The blocks are a little bigger than Lego <br/>\nblocks, and stone-colored.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother building set my kids have really enjoyed is Ramagon.

Ridiculous  <br/>\n- what we have are principles our families live by. What we try to  <br/>\navoid are arbitrary rigid &quot;rules.&quot; If you think that not having  <br/>\narbitrary rigid rules means we have no boundaries, you&#39;re not  <br/>\nlistening.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The second group are toward the same end as the first--they eschew<br/>\n&gt; anything &quot;schoolish,&quot; but may divide some parts of life from<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who don&#39;t test, don&#39;t give assignments, and don&#39;t  <br/>\nfollow a parent-planned and directed curriculum, but do have  <br/>\nrestrictions on tv, assigned chores, bedtimes, and food requirements.  <br/>\nTrue. I consider them unschoolers, myself, but I also think they  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t realized the FULL potential of the unschooling philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; The third group are Holt/Gatto devotees. They tend toward &quot;life<br/>\n&gt; experiences&quot; and the library rather than television. They tend to<br/>\n&gt; believe that not all experiences are created equal (since, were that<br/>\n&gt; so, school would be as viable an experience as unschooling), and hence<br/>\n&gt; edge (or at least emphasize) the Classical Model in terms of potential<br/>\n&gt; content, and unschooling as a method of delivery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just nonsense. Holt and Gatto are VERY different, for one  <br/>\nthing, so I&#39;m not sure how someone could be a devotee of both. And how  <br/>\ncan you say this group tends toward &quot;life experiences&quot; - how on earth  <br/>\ndoes that distinguish them from anybody else? Library versus  <br/>\ntelevision? That&#39;s just a barely disguised insult - as if those who  <br/>\nwatch tv are tending away from libraries? Again - nonsense. All  <br/>\nexperiences created equal? What does that mean? Getting married is  <br/>\nequal to breaking your leg? Learning to read is equal to having toast  <br/>\nfor breakfast? What? Nobody thinks that. And people using &quot;the  <br/>\nClassical Model&quot; aren&#39;t unschooling - they have a fixed curriculum and  <br/>\neven if they use a gentle method of guiding the child to learn what is  <br/>\nincluded in that curriculum, you can&#39;t impose a curriculum and unschool  <br/>\nat the same time.  Here is a very brief description of what is included  <br/>\nin a &quot;Classical Model of Education:&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n****<br/>\nOn the first level, which we call the Grammar level, the child learns  <br/>\nthe basic facts and the fundamental rules. In English, this would  <br/>\ninclude phonics, vocabulary, and spelling rules. In mathematics, the  <br/>\nnumber system, math facts, and measurements. In history, this would  <br/>\ninclude such things as the story part of history, including names,  <br/>\nplaces, and dates.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the second level, which we call the Logic level, the child learns to  <br/>\ncomprehend the way these facts fit together. In English, this would  <br/>\ninclude the parts of speech and the construction of sentences. In  <br/>\nmathematics, the proofs of algebra or geometry. In history, the reasons  <br/>\nfor wars, migrations, or inventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the third level, which we call the Rhetoric level, the child learns  <br/>\nto express and practice what he has learned. Essays, compositions, and  <br/>\npublic speaking are applications of English study. Surveying,  <br/>\naccounting, and engineering are all applications of mathematical study.  <br/>\nDeveloping views in politics, economics, religion, or science are  <br/>\napplications of historical study.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is NOT unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fourth group are what the first group distainfully calls &quot;eclectic<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;posers.&quot; They are usually people who like the idea<br/>\n&gt; of unschooling and want to adopt it, but because they have not yet<br/>\n&gt; shifted their educational paradigm, have not made the leap from<br/>\n&gt; another method to further down the unschooling continuum.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDisdainfully? Tell that to Eclectic Homeschooling Online&#39;s Bev Krueger,  <br/>\nsomeone many of us here have known for 10 years, and who is largely  <br/>\nresponsible for that term, having coined it some years ago when we all  <br/>\nwere coming up with ways to describe various homeschooling styles, and  <br/>\nit is CERTAINLY not a negative term. It does NOT denote people who like  <br/>\nunschooling but haven&#39;t made the leap yet - it is the clear choice of  <br/>\npeople who don&#39;t WANT to unschool, but do want to pick and choose from  <br/>\nall kinds of different methods, depending on child, subject and  <br/>\ncircumstances. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with eclectic homeschooling, you&#39;ll  <br/>\nwant to spend some time at &lt;www.eho.org&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Thoughts?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts are that you didn&#39;t get much of the above right and I have  <br/>\nno idea what your point was anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --Jen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Book worship, though, is <br/>\na problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe far end of the spectrum, though----the radical unschoolers---are the loud <br/>\nones here. I would fall into this &quot;radical unschooler group&quot;: the unschooling <br/>\nphilosophy permeates our lives. ALL learning is valuable and is equal. We <br/>\nmake connections throughout our lives and we never stop learning. We immerse <br/>\nourselves in passions and wonder.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoundaries on learning? On living? On what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The second group are toward the same end as the first--they eschew<br/>\n </span></blockquote>anything &quot;schoolish,&quot; but may divide some parts of life from<br/>\n&quot;unschooling.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, these are the folks that unschool in the &quot;educational&quot; part of their <br/>\nlives *only*. Given time and support and ideas, they can, and often do, allow <br/>\nit to leak into the rest of their lives and learn to enjoy their children and <br/>\ntheir lives more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The third group are Holt/Gatto devotees. They tend toward &quot;life<br/>\n </span></blockquote>experiences&quot; and the library rather than television. They tend to<br/>\nbelieve that not all experiences are created equal (since, were that<br/>\nso, school would be as viable an experience as unschooling), and hence<br/>\nedge (or at least emphasize) the Classical Model in terms of potential<br/>\ncontent, and unschooling as a method of delivery.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get this group at all!

That <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t follow.  The Classical Method &quot;requires&quot; that certain things be <br/>\nlearned. That can&#39;t happen with unschooling. Makes no sense----sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is certainly a viable experience---to 90-something percent of this <br/>\ncountry&#39;s children! Unschoolers just believe that school destroys children&#39;s <br/>\nnatural curiosity, creativity, and intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The fourth group are what the first group distainfully calls &quot;eclectic<br/>\n </span></blockquote>homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;posers.&quot; They are usually people who like the idea<br/>\nof unschooling and want to adopt it, but because they have not yet<br/>\nshifted their educational paradigm, have not made the leap from<br/>\nanother method to further down the unschooling continuum.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEclectics tend to be happy where they are. They have no desire to make the <br/>\nshift. And they don&#39;t believe that &quot;natural learning&quot; of everything is possible. <br/>\nTherefore, the &quot;eclectic&quot;  pick-n-choose curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Posers&quot; would be those that say they unschool &quot;except for math&quot; or &quot;on the <br/>\nweekends&quot; or  &quot;after the children finish their schoolwork&quot;.They just want the <br/>\nneat LABEL of &quot;unschooler&quot;. They don&#39;t understand natural learning, nor do they <br/>\nseem to want to. They like to seem to be &quot;on the cutting edge&quot;, but don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to *actually* BE there!
