I have <br/>\n3 kids (near 7, 4 & 1 1/2). I am moving to Northern Idaho next year & <br/>\nam trying to find other Idaho homeschoolers to correspond with.  I <br/>\nhave been searching for groups, but not had much success.  Do any of <br/>\nyou live in Idaho -OR- can give me some leads to groups in the <br/>\nstate?  I prefer an inclusive/eclective group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any information or opinions on living there would be much <br/>\nappreciated.  I am from California & have read accounts of newcomers <br/>\nnot being welcomed.  Any truth to this? I am encouraged after reading <br/>\nabout what a homeschool friendly state it is (at least the laws <br/>\nappear to be).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, any info welcomed.  Feel free to e-mail me privately.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27780,"nextTopicId":27654}}
