So all of <br/>\nthis thinking is new to me. But something you said earlier really <br/>\nclicked. I got to thinking about how I like to reinforce the stuff I <br/>\napprove or appreciate in my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I see one act kindly, I try to immediately say so. If one of my <br/>\nkids shares a toy, gives up a computer turn or helps a sibling load a <br/>\nprogram, I notice outloud so all can hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell today it ocurred to me that I probably take their help for <br/>\ngranted because it is what we have always done and expect them to do. <br/>\nI&#39;m not an ogre, by any means, but I don&#39;t often notice the hard work <br/>\nthey put in with the same level of enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today, I really paid attention to any time a child spontaneously <br/>\ndid an act of clean up. I saw one child volunteer to clean the floors <br/>\nwith a broom. Another child carried my plate to the sink twice in one <br/>\nday after serving me a snack. Another one put away his toys without <br/>\nanyone asking him to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed and commented each time. Then later I thanked them very <br/>\nsincerely for all of their hard work in our home every day and every <br/>\nweek. One of them said, &quot;Oh mom. We don&#39;t do enough, really.&quot; (I <br/>\nrealized then that that is probably waht I&#39;ve communicated!) I <br/>\nreplied, &quot;Actually, I think you guys do a ton of stuff to make this <br/>\nplace run smoothly and I totally appreciate it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLater at bedtime, the same one said, &quot;That was nice of you to say we <br/>\nwork hard. I didn&#39;t we did.&quot; Then I told him that I was wondering if <br/>\nthey would want to keep doing their chores if I gve them a free <br/>\nchoice. Both the one who is the most considerate of all the kids and <br/>\nthe one who likes to do his work the least said, &quot;yes.&quot; That stunned <br/>\nme. Iasked why. They said, &quot;because the house looks better and feels <br/>\nbetter when we do it and it&#39;s a lot for you to do alone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell... what a great onversation we had and I am so grateful for some <br/>\nnew awareness of my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I spontaneously did multiple sinks worth of dishes today to help <br/>\nout the washer who had a big social life planned for today.
