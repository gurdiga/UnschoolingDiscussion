Your posts answered alot of my recent (since joining<br/>\nthe list) concerns (on my &#39;ability&#39; to be a REAL unschooler).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore joining, and only going by reading a few HEM magazines and J.<br/>\nHolt books, I&#39;d &#39;thought&#39; I wanted to unschool.  In fact, I acknowledged<br/>\nto myself that we&#39;d already been unschoolers since Emma was born (she&#39;s<br/>\nnow three).   It felt natural to me, being a devotee to attachement<br/>\n(child-led) parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading a few of the threads, I began to worry....I began to think<br/>\nthat if I was an &#39;unschooler&#39; that meant that I could never &#39;teach&#39; my<br/>\ndaughter things.  That word seemed to be a big NO NO here : )<br/>\nEver since, I&#39;ve had a hard time trying to wrap my brain around the<br/>\nconcept of unschooling.  Maybe I had it all wrong, I wondered?!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, with your post, it all begins to feel natural again!  I can &#39;teach&#39;<br/>\nEm to cook since she loves it!).  I can &#39;teach&#39; her how a plant can grow<br/>\nfrom a seed (since she&#39;s curious)!  And when she asks, I can teach her<br/>\nwhat different sounds letters make.  I really didn&#39;t like being paranoid<br/>\nof using that word....teach : )<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting back to phonics books....Have you heard anything about Reading<br/>\nReflex?  It&#39;s a&#39;new(?) method of phonics where there are no rules to<br/>\nlearn...and they use terms like &#39;sound pictures&#39; (the letters that<br/>\nrepresent the sounds in words).  I&#39;ve a friend out in CA who is tutoring<br/>\nusing this book/method and she claims that it is the best thing she&#39;s<br/>\never seen (and she&#39;s beena reading tutor for 20some years).  I&#39;ve just<br/>\nordered it and haven&#39;t had a chance to read yet, so I&#39;d be very<br/>\ninterested in any feedback.  I&#39;m not intending to drill my dd with<br/>\nit...but I am looking into finding a better way to answer some of her<br/>\n&#39;reading&#39; questions than I how learned in ps....because frankly, I<br/>\ncannot remember alot of what I learned (imagine that!)...but I do<br/>\nremember that I had a hard time with all those rules : ).<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Denise in Louisiana (which is ALSO a great state to learn at home)!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39911,"nextTopicId":39906}}
