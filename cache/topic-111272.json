I may not know what <br/>\nto do sometimes, but this list sure is good at helping me to look at <br/>\nit from a different perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the first deployment for sure, but it has been a pretty <br/>\nrough year and dad has been gone alot.  There isn&#39;t much I can do <br/>\nabout that aspect of it, but I can see to it that he has more free <br/>\ntime and more mom time (when and if he wants it).  I can only <br/>\nimagine what it must be like to be the oldest child of five, only <br/>\nboy, who&#39;s dad seems more like a figment of his imagination! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help that I had a bunch of surgeries this past summer and <br/>\nthat was a real downer for everyone.  I am feeling much better now <br/>\nand am able to do a lot more that I even thought that I would be by <br/>\nthis time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to list some activities that he might like to do and then <br/>\nask him to add to it, matter of fact while I am at it I can see if <br/>\nthe girls would like to do it as well.  One on one time is a little <br/>\nmore difficult, but can be arranged.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son only has a couple of friends and seems to like it that way.  <br/>\nHis favorite friend&#39;s parents are WAY strict and don&#39;t allow much, <br/>\nbut did finally after 2 years let him sleep over here the other <br/>\nnight and I know that the boys would like to do it again and this <br/>\nkid is 13 and a really nice kid.  They get along great!  So that is <br/>\na possibility.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just recently found out about a whole slew of places that I never <br/>\nknew about that I thought the kids might like to check out and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have any schedule at all especially when hubby is away like <br/>\nthis.  It is a fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants kind of life and it is <br/>\nwonderful (except the missing dad part).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Zach does feel that somehow he is responsible to be the <br/>\nman and that may very well feel overwhelming to him as well.  <br/>\nSomething to have dad talk to him about maybe before he leaves.  All <br/>\nmy kids hold some frustration towards the military life, because <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t ask for this, but were rather born into it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just had another situation with him and seemed to be able <br/>\nto diffuse it with separation (just he and I for a few minutes) and <br/>\nsome humor on my part instead of a speech.

I am feeling very overwhelmed and lost <br/>\nwith trying to communicate with my son.  No matter how I have tried <br/>\nto approach him about his behavior, it seems to go bad.  I feel like <br/>\nI am furthering the rift in our relationship each time I try to talk <br/>\nthings out with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the issues I am trying to deal with are him saying very <br/>\nhurtful things to siblings and physically hurting them everytime I <br/>\nturn around.  I don&#39;t think he means to hurt them physically or <br/>\nmentally, but when they and myself explain that it is hurting them, <br/>\nhe seems totally unfazed and uncaring.  I am struggling with how to <br/>\ndeal with this situation.  He has never been a bad kid and with the <br/>\nexception of a few things that we are constantly dealing with I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really have any problems out of him. I am not yelling (yet, <br/>\nbut I feel it coming), trying to point out that it is destructive to <br/>\na person&#39;s self esteem to be insulted constantly and so forth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that if I could verbally and physically focus on all he <br/>\ndoes that is good might help him to see that kindness is much more <br/>\nwonderful for all who come in contact with him.  But,I must be doing <br/>\nsomething wrong because I am making no headway and seem to be making <br/>\nthe problem worse. I asked him why he felt the need to poke his <br/>\nsister in the head and he just laughed and said because I felt like <br/>\nit.  Even after she was crying he did it again, before she came to <br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t walk around hitting him or anyone else and it seems <br/>\nespecially odd to me that he would do this &quot;just because she was <br/>\nthere and he felt like it&quot;.  To me it just seems mean and hateful.  <br/>\nHe in these ways is behaving like someone I would not want my <br/>\nchildren to play with, because of their hostility and meanness.  <br/>\nThere are some dynamics to be considered as well.  He is the only <br/>\nboy of 5 children and the oldest.  His dad is also getting ready to <br/>\ndeploy again in less than a week to the Persian Gulf again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this behavior has been going on for a long time now and <br/>\nthough I have been trying to be patient and talk it out it has now <br/>\ngotten to a point where others in the house are miserable.  Is this <br/>\njust a phase that boys go through, or am I being naive.  The girls <br/>\nare not near as difficult to deal with and the issues are a lot <br/>\nfewer and farther between.  The ideas that have worked to solve <br/>\nsituations with my girls are not working with my son.  This is <br/>\nprobably a &quot;Well duh, he&#39;s not a girl, moment&quot; but I am seriously <br/>\nworried about the relationship or what seems to be a lack there of <br/>\nand the fact that it is snowballing fast in a bad direction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts on how to respectfully handle this so that we can work <br/>\non rebuilding a happy relationship.

I have noticed with my son (who is only 5, but the only boy and Daddy isn&#39;t home much because of his job with the Coast Guard) that when he gets rough with the girls, he hasn&#39;t been outside much; so I try to encourage him to get outside to ride his bike or scooter.

I am feeling very overwhelmed and lost <br/>\nwith trying to communicate with my son.  No matter how I have tried <br/>\nto approach him about his behavior, it seems to go bad.  I feel like <br/>\nI am furthering the rift in our relationship each time I try to talk <br/>\nthings out with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the issues I am trying to deal with are him saying very <br/>\nhurtful things to siblings and physically hurting them everytime I <br/>\nturn around.  I don&#39;t think he means to hurt them physically or <br/>\nmentally, but when they and myself explain that it is hurting them, <br/>\nhe seems totally unfazed and uncaring.  I am struggling with how to <br/>\ndeal with this situation.  He has never been a bad kid and with the <br/>\nexception of a few things that we are constantly dealing with I <br/>\ndon&#39;t really have any problems out of him. I am not yelling (yet, <br/>\nbut I feel it coming), trying to point out that it is destructive to <br/>\na person&#39;s self esteem to be insulted constantly and so forth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that if I could verbally and physically focus on all he <br/>\ndoes that is good might help him to see that kindness is much more <br/>\nwonderful for all who come in contact with him.  But,I must be doing <br/>\nsomething wrong because I am making no headway and seem to be making <br/>\nthe problem worse. I asked him why he felt the need to poke his <br/>\nsister in the head and he just laughed and said because I felt like <br/>\nit.  Even after she was crying he did it again, before she came to <br/>\nme.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t walk around hitting him or anyone else and it seems <br/>\nespecially odd to me that he would do this &quot;just because she was <br/>\nthere and he felt like it&quot;.  To me it just seems mean and hateful.  <br/>\nHe in these ways is behaving like someone I would not want my <br/>\nchildren to play with, because of their hostility and meanness.  <br/>\nThere are some dynamics to be considered as well.  He is the only <br/>\nboy of 5 children and the oldest.  His dad is also getting ready to <br/>\ndeploy again in less than a week to the Persian Gulf again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this behavior has been going on for a long time now and <br/>\nthough I have been trying to be patient and talk it out it has now <br/>\ngotten to a point where others in the house are miserable.  Is this <br/>\njust a phase that boys go through, or am I being naive.  The girls <br/>\nare not near as difficult to deal with and the issues are a lot <br/>\nfewer and farther between.  The ideas that have worked to solve <br/>\nsituations with my girls are not working with my son.
