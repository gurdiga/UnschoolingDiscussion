If she&#39;s got the concept in her head, and she&#39;s able<br/>\nto apply it in her life, why would she need to do with with pencil, paper,<br/>\nand pennies?  If she wants it, sometime, she can ask you or someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather it sounds like sitting her down might turn her off on percentages,<br/>\nand perhaps even eventually turn her off on you in a way.  I mean, if every<br/>\ncool thing that she learns turns out to have a schooly application that Mom<br/>\nwants to show you, maybe she&#39;d simply stop sharing with Mom.  I don&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat you&#39;d be dull or mean about it, just that I think you can trust the<br/>\nlearning all by itself; it likely doesn&#39;t need to be reinforced on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d just note in your mind or your homeschooling records, if you keep them,<br/>\nthat today was cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75874,"nextTopicId":75870}}
