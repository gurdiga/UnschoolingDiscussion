So far this morning, Naomi hasn&#39;t had it on once...she&#39;s outside helping some kindergarden teachers at the park with a group of kids. She loves kids. She&#39;s having a blast pushing them on the swings. Good for her!! I guess we are fortunate in that we live right next to the park ...its almost outside our front door and Naomi had gone rollerblading, came back in and put on her shoes and told me where she was going. I think its great. Its almost time for our walk this morning...its a beautiful day outside today.<br/>\n<br/>\nVaughnde Lee<br/>\nMissoula, Montana<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: ambersand &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ambersand@...\">ambersand@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Date: Wednesday, April 25, 2001 3:49 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: TV turn off<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The tv is driving me bananas!!!
