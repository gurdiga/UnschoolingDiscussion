I DO want to hear what others think, <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s likely there will be a next time.. If not with Landon, with my <br/>\nother children.  We did exhaust all possiblities.  The shopping trip had <br/>\nalready been planned, and there were about 20 other kids involved, so they <br/>\ncouldnt change the date &quot;just for him&quot;.. We only had one vehicle capable of <br/>\nmaking the trip.. The tires weren&#39;t reliable on our car.   I asked Mom and <br/>\nDad to bring him down the next day, but they also had previous plans ( and, <br/>\nthey dont like to camp.. lol)  So, we did try to find a solution.  I did feel <br/>\nguilty.. I felt like I was depriving him of some life changing experience.. <br/>\nThat is how he felt,and how he wanted me to feel. And there was plenty of <br/>\nresentment go go around too. .He resenting us for outvoting him.. And us <br/>\nresenting him for have such a bad attitude and trying to make the rest of us <br/>\nmiserable.    I guess the good thing is, we all survived.    And the hard <br/>\nlesson is, in life, you can&#39;t always get what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\n As a matter of fact, I had to say no again to him last week.    The big ice <br/>\nstorm was forecast and it has started freezing rain.  He wanted to go out to <br/>\nlunch with some of his friends.  The roads were already beginning to get <br/>\nslippery.  His friend who was driving has only had his liscense for a few <br/>\nmonths.  I said, No. I&#39;m sorry, you can&#39;t go, its too risky.  He was mad <br/>\nagain. That indestrutible attititude that &quot;nothing will happen to me&quot; kicked <br/>\nin and he argued that he should be allowed to go.  I didn&#39;t give in.    I <br/>\nasked him if the other kids parents said they could go.   He said that they <br/>\nwere working and didnt know where they were or really care what they were <br/>\ndoing.  I said.. Oh, OK, so you wish I didnt care about you.. He said., well, <br/>\nno, but it would be a lot more fun..  Well,I would rather him be alive and <br/>\nmad at me than killed while having fun.  Anyway, he ranted and fussed and <br/>\nraved for about an hour.. Then he realized that the roads were completetly <br/>\niced over.. He called his friend and guess what.. They didnt go out to lunch <br/>\neither. He is the stage manager of a play that is running this weekend.  He <br/>\nand his friends all went out to eat last night after the play.  And the roads <br/>\nwere clear :-)  Again, alls well that ends well. IMO.. <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42586,"nextTopicId":51938}}
