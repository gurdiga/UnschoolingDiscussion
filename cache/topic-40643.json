This is a great <br/>\nprogram based on the book Flat Stanley - you make flat travelers and mail <br/>\nthem to others in the program, and host some as well.  You fill out journals <br/>\nfor the travelers and mail them back after a week or two, and send back <br/>\npostcards and/or souvenirs, whatever you want.  The idea is for them to get <br/>\nto know your area.  You get to make friends from all over the world and see <br/>\nhow other people live, and get a glimpse of other states and countries.  My <br/>\nkids are learning tons about geography (we have a huge wall map and put a <br/>\nstar everywhere our travelers visit and a different colored star for our <br/>\nguests) and they are so thrilled when a traveler comes home or we get a new <br/>\nguest.  We currently have travelers in Canada, New Zealand and Australia, <br/>\nplus various states.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you&#39;d like to participate, it&#39;s free (or almost free, it&#39;ll cost <br/>\nyou a stamp)- just go to &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.flattravelers.com&quot;&gt;www.flattravelers.com&lt;/A&gt;!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy traveling!<br/>\nSteph<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Flat Travelers","postDate":"1029032308","msgId":40643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqNGhoaytkbGlrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":50973,"prevInTime":40642,"nextInTime":40644,"topicId":40643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a neat thing some of your kids might get into.

Kids make little <br/>\nflat travelers.  They can be people, animals, or whatever.  Then they <br/>\nfind someone on the list of people who are willing to host their flat <br/>\ntraveler.  Your flat traveler goes on a trip (through the mail!) to <br/>\ntheir home and they show them around.  They keep a journal of the <br/>\nflat traveler&#39;s activities and maybe take some pictures and send your <br/>\nflat traveler back home after a week.
