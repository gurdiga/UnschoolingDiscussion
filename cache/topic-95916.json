In the beginning, I would really let it get to me <br/>\nthough, and let it second guess my beliefs, but over the past nine years, I&#39;ve <br/>\ncome to the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t matter.  My children are what they are, <br/>\nand they are GOOD people.  I don&#39;t necessarily take full credit for it, but I <br/>\ndo realize that the fact that I let them be who they are, is what gives them <br/>\nthe confidence to continue.  Of course I try to stress good behavior in them, <br/>\nbut my manner in doing this is to talk to them.  Talk to them about feelings, <br/>\ntalk to them about cause/effect.  Such as... when you do &#39;abc&#39;, what do you <br/>\nthink happens and who do you think it happens too?  Why do you think things <br/>\nhappens that way?   It helps them keep aware that the things they do and say can and <br/>\ndo have direct effects to others around them.  <br/>\nRather than hollowly saying things such as &quot;Don&#39;t talk that way, or, don&#39;t do <br/>\nthat&quot;  I just imagine they are thinking &quot;Don&#39;t talk what way?  All I said is <br/>\n*********&quot;  Know what I mean???  I just have vivid memories of feeling those <br/>\nways when I was a kid.
