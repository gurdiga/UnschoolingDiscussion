I know this is the wrong way to look at it, we are excited. Jack seems to be excited, Moly is ambivalent Darin is excited, I&#39;m all sorts of things, but mostly I&#39;m concerned about Moly and Jack having to share me, my time with them, me shortchanging them... I remember how long it takes to nurse, I remember having to put all sorts of things on hold because certain things just have to come first with a baby. When Moly was two and Jack was a baby Moly was too young to &#39;explain&#39; to and she was still nursing at that time anyway, there was no sharing problem. I just know things are going to be different and honestly, I just don&#39;t know.
