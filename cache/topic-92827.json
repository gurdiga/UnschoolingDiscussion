And<br/>\nwhen I explain to people that I am lacto-ovo veg., I usually just say<br/>\n(in the presence of my kids) that &quot;I don&#39;t eat any animals.&quot;  This has<br/>\neliminated the &quot;but you eat chicken and fish, don&#39;t you dear?&quot;  Or the<br/>\nawkward mixup when I&#39;m served seafood in deference to my veg-ism.   I<br/>\nwant my kids to know what&#39;s going in their mouths.  Teenie drinks are<br/>\nnot ever called juice, they&#39;re &quot;sugar drinks&quot; and Morgaine can&#39;t drink<br/>\nthem.  Her sugar is fairly limited due to yeast issues.  I wouldn&#39;t slip<br/>\na tomato into her salad (which she doesn&#39;t like) by cutting it up and<br/>\ncalling it &quot;fruit.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nFurthermore, I didn&#39;t suggest she eat seagulls.  I told her later in her<br/>\nroom that she was old enough to make her own decision about being<br/>\nvegetarian.  She looked out the window thoughtfully, saw a squirrel, and<br/>\nwent through her list of animals.  Quite frankly I found the whole thing<br/>\nhilarious because my dh and mother were appalled.  The &quot;old enough&quot; bit<br/>\nneeded clarification because when I tell my kids &quot;when you&#39;re older,&quot; as<br/>\nin &quot;when you&#39;re a little bit bigger you can choose to be an omnivore<br/>\nlike Daddy,&quot; I usually add an age, &quot;like maybe when you&#39;re six.&quot;  It<br/>\ngives her more control.  Also makes &quot;older&quot; a more acceptable answer.<br/>\nSo, thr clarification comment was necessary; letting her know there was<br/>\none more area of her life over which she has autonomy.  She likes very<br/>\nclear boundaries, so I keep them that way when the boundaries are clear<br/>\nenough for definition.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, regarding the blood type diet - it&#39;s only one theory of eating.<br/>\nThere are many, many others, each with their own compelling arguments<br/>\nand ideas, as well as counterarguments and ideas.  It&#39;s likely that,<br/>\nsince I do a lot of reading in this area, my kids will end up with their<br/>\nown very strong, well-researched conclusions which I will document under<br/>\n&quot;science&quot; as &quot;nutritional studies.&quot;  I include them (mostly Morgaine so<br/>\nfar; Orion&#39;s still learning to speak in sentences and Isaac is still a<br/>\nbaby)in my thoughts and processes.  I tell them when I think I&#39;ve made a<br/>\nmistake, when I&#39;ve changed my mind because I learned something new, etc.<br/>\nMorgaine&#39;s already heard a bit about blood-type theory when she was<br/>\ntalking to a friend of mine who&#39;s following the diet.  She didn&#39;t yet<br/>\nseem impressed.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKristi  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92823,"nextTopicId":92833}}
