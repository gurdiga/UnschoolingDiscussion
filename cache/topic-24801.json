Then I<br/>\nrealized (when I was finally able to get to the last digest) that I had<br/>\nlearned a lot! Wow...<br/>\n<br/>\nI, for one, am glad that people express their opions, even those with rather<br/>\nUN unschooling opinions. It helps me to contrast where I am in relation to<br/>\nboth sides of the issue. It helps me to see more clearly the direction I<br/>\nwould like to head in. So, I thank all of you for your input. You make an<br/>\ninteresting read. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24779,"nextTopicId":24558}}
