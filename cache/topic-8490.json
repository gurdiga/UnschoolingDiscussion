I know these children<br/>\n &gt;from the<br/>\n &gt;Berkeley YMCA, where they swim, play basketball, join group arts and<br/>\n &gt;crafts<br/>\n &gt;projects, and generally are a part of the community. Please read and<br/>\n &gt;circulate this letter - it is a lesson in the absurd, and it could<br/>\n &gt;happen to<br/>\n &gt;anyone. Patty is a down to earth older mother who gave birth to twins<br/>\n &gt;at age<br/>\n &gt;45 after long term infertility, and she has been following the<br/>\n &gt;Independent<br/>\n &gt;Studies curriculum supervised by the Berkeley Unified School District.<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Needless to say this has not increased my respect for the child rescue<br/>\n &gt;establishment. Homeschooling is not the only item that could generate<br/>\n &gt;such a<br/>\n &gt;bizarre set of events - any over-zealous neighbor or social worker who<br/>\n &gt;doesn&#39;t like your religion or lack thereof, your family bed, your<br/>\n &gt;letting<br/>\n &gt;children play naked in the backyard, your messy house, diet, longterm<br/>\n &gt;breastfeeding, style of dress or choice of family acctivities could<br/>\n &gt;get<br/>\n &gt;something like this nightmare going. Official documents blame<br/>\n &gt;Ptaricia for<br/>\n &gt;using &quot;manipulative charm&quot; with the children because she told<br/>\n &gt;them, &quot;Smile<br/>\n &gt;and tell the truth if anyone asks you questions.&quot;<br/>\n &gt;<br/>\n &gt;Please note that a legal defense fund has been established on Patty&#39;s<br/>\n &gt;behalf<br/>\n &gt;- if you or anyone or any group you trust could contribute even a<br/>\n &gt;little, it<br/>\n &gt;would be wonderful.
