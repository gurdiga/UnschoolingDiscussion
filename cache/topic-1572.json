What Lisa found with her grandmother is typical (i.e., short outings,  a few hours,  to familiar places).\r<br/>\nGrandparents may not want to be upfront about physical/medical limitations (they often don&#39;t want to worry or burden family).  Try to be respectful of her wishes.\r<br/>\nI am speaking from a decade of experience in geriatric social work.\r<br/>\nI imagine your children will benefit greatly from this trip!  Hope they get lots of &#39;stories&#39; and &#39;family history&#39;.\r<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1559,"nextTopicId":1556}}
