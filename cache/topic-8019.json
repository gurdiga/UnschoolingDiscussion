So, some<br/>\n&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is simply<br/>\n&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>\n&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>\n&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>\n&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and younger<br/>\n&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>\n&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>\n&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several<br/>\nlists<br/>\n&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>\n&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>\n&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes through<br/>\n&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>\n&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>\n&gt; chemical free.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lynda, who will stop ranting now %-}<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Tamilooch@...\">Tamilooch@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Parental Crisis<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, April 11, 2000 12:06 PM<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive<br/>\nmoms<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>\n&gt; need<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>\n&gt; cleaning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for<br/>\nher<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>\n&gt; myself<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe<br/>\n&gt; my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was<br/>\ntalking<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>\n&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her<br/>\n10<br/>\n&gt; yod<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have<br/>\nany<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for<br/>\n&gt; now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone<br/>\nagree?<br/>\n&gt; The<br/>\n&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ??????

My mom Never explained anything to us so I <br/>\nthink my sisters and I tend to go overboard on certain subjects. Especially <br/>\nthe kind &quot;you dont talk about, its just not nice.) Glad I grew up in the 80s <br/>\nand the info wasnt hard to come by even if I would have rathered  hear it <br/>\nfrom mom. Anyway I think your right that she dosnt need a Dr. right now, and <br/>\nIm so relieved to hear you say that because getting her into the Dr. office <br/>\nof the ped. she has had since she was 2 is a process. She really hates it. <br/>\nShe wont even pee in the cup, we have to bring it home. I also do not think <br/>\nit is an injury as she tends to be somewhat of a hypercondriac(sp) (thats <br/>\njust my way of saying she loves to make sure I tend to all her boo bos.) She <br/>\ndefinately would have said something to me. And as for utis and fisures Im <br/>\nnot sure so I think well just keep and eye on it and see if we need to see <br/>\nthe DR. <br/>\nThanks for keeping me grounded.<br/>\nI really appreciate it.<br/>\nTamie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8016,"nextTopicId":8082}}
