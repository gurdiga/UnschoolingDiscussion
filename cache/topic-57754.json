I do wish I had known more about labelling feelings for<br/>\nkids when he was little.  My daughter does that with her kids, and they&#39;re<br/>\ndeveloping large &quot;feeling vocabularies&quot;.  I think that would have helped.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s been helping lately is things I&#39;ve picked up here.  Even though I<br/>\ndon&#39;t much like TV, I&#39;ve been watching a bit with him, and he seems to like<br/>\nthat.  He&#39;ll even pat the couch and tell me to sit down if I&#39;m standing<br/>\nthere watching something as I go by, so I assume he likes it.  I think I<br/>\nposted before about starting to do things for him sometimes that I didn&#39;t<br/>\nused to do because he could do them himself.  I&#39;ve made more of a point of<br/>\ntelling him I love him.  I have to do it on the fly, so to speak, because he<br/>\ntook to replying, &quot;No you don&#39;t,&quot; in a kind of joking way around puberty.<br/>\nThat was when I stopped saying it as much, until I realized I could &quot;ambush&quot;<br/>\nhim with it.  I think all of these things are coming together to produce the<br/>\nkind of day we had Sunday, when I drove him to town to see the screening of<br/>\nthe film his class made.  He surprised the heck out of me by asking me all<br/>\nkinds of questions, &quot;what do I think about this and that&quot;, kind of<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57816,"nextTopicId":57849}}
