I also felt uncomfortable with the <br/>\npost about not allowing IM etc to be sent unless they had the spelling <br/>\nchecked.<br/>\nIt appears this person is very angry quite simply because they do not &#39;get&#39; <br/>\nthe philosophy of unschooling and are on the defensive. It doesn&#39;t seem much <br/>\ndifferent from the confrontations between those who school and those who <br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\nI would agree that maybe they are looking a for a different type of <br/>\nhomeschooling and not unschooling at all. It does appear as if they are <br/>\ntrying to redefine unschooling to fit in with their idea of homeschooling.<br/>\nI think this debate is on a hiding to nowhere as the person isn&#39;t even <br/>\nlistening to the posts about how easy it is to misunderstand what people are <br/>\nsaying. I find their posts extremely aggressive at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n                        Regards, Elaine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
