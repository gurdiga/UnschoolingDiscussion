I wonder what a &#39;goatee&#39; is?<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t been able to figure out when a fetus becomes a child, so I have<br/>\nbacked it up to conception.  When would the eagle or the turtle in an egg<br/>\nbecome the animal?  Even if it is only a &quot;potential&quot;...  Because I think the<br/>\nlife is at conception, I think abortion and child respect are incompatible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be in favor of the death penalty - after all, it&#39;s in the Bible!<br/>\nBut now I don&#39;t support that either (the penalty, not the Bible).  I think<br/>\nthat respect for life means all life (so far human, but I may be moving<br/>\ntoward some veg beliefs), so whether it is young or old or possibly<br/>\ncriminal, I think we should honor and protect the individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers, this can mean the way we treat infants and the way we treat<br/>\nthe elderly, as well as taking a position on the death penalty (I think it&#39;s<br/>\ngreat that some gov. is commuting all the sentences in the state to life).<br/>\nIt can also mean calling about the possible (probable) war on the White<br/>\nHouse # that was given earlier (202) 456-1111.  If we respect life, then it<br/>\nshould be all life - our children, those in the military, and people who<br/>\nwear clothes that are very different from ours!  Pray for peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54685,"nextTopicId":54698}}
