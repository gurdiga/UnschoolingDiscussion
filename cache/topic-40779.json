Our children <br/>\nare living their lives right now. They&#39;re not busy spending 12 years <br/>\npreparing for their lives at 18 or 21. They get to be participating in the <br/>\nreal world RIGHT NOW. I believe that&#39;s very different from what society as a <br/>\nwhole believes about children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Unschooling parents accept the truth that learning is happening all day, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;every day. We accept that we cannot be aware, nor can even our children, <br/>\n&gt;&gt;of what is entering their minds as &quot;learning&quot; and what is being filtered <br/>\n&gt;&gt;away.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The same really holds true for schoolchildren as well. It&#39;s just that by <br/>\ntesting and tracking, the illusion of a &quot;guarantee of learning&quot; is <br/>\nmaintained for jittery parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What we must do is trust that if we have provided them with tools and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;access and the freedom to choose what interests them, we are doing the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;best we can.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And maybe also the help and guidance to use some of those tools, when asked <br/>\nfor of course. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40762,"nextTopicId":40759}}
