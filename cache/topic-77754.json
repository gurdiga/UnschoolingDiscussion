Perhaps <br/>\nfirst and foremost is the fact that this bill opens the door to <br/>\nfederal regulation of homeschooling and creates the potential for <br/>\nadditional legislation and increased regulation. Once passed, this <br/>\nbill becomes law. And once it is law the agencies responsible for <br/>\nenforcing compliance with the law will write regulations based on <br/>\ntheir interpretations of it; those regulations will be written by <br/>\npeople who may or may not have a good understanding of homeschooling, <br/>\nbut they&#39;ll be regulations with the force of law behind them. The <br/>\npotential for conflict and years of working to clarify intent is <br/>\ntremendous.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship between homeschoolers and the state differs from <br/>\nstate to state and is the result of many years of citizen involvement <br/>\nwith the  legislative process. While some states still have difficult <br/>\nsituations, in many others years of hard work by homeschoolers would <br/>\nstand to be undermined by this bill. In some states there are strong <br/>\nsupport groups in place to act as watchdogs and oversee what might <br/>\nhappen as a result of this bill. But what will happen in those states <br/>\nwithout cohesive homeschool support groups?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe claim in Sec. 2 that homeschooling is &quot;an effective means for <br/>\nyoung people to achieve success on standardized tests&quot; is downright <br/>\nfoolish. What purpose could possibly be served by linking <br/>\nhomeschooling with standardized testing in federal legislation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is, this is a poorly written omnibus bill which messes with <br/>\nmultiple issues such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education <br/>\nAct (IDEA), the Internal Revenue Code and federal tax issues, child <br/>\nlabor laws, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a <br/>\nfederal scholarship program and more - but addresses them as they <br/>\nspecifically relate to homeschoolers. These are issues which - if <br/>\naddressed at all - should be more broadly addressed, and should <br/>\nguarantee equal rights and services for everyone rather than asking <br/>\nfor special favors specifically for homeschoolers. We do not need <br/>\nthese issues addressed in our name, because we do not need to become <br/>\na special interest group in the eyes of federal legislators.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there&#39;s an even larger question to ask, and that is: Why the move <br/>\nto strengthen the power of the federal government over what has <br/>\nalways been a state concern? Constitutionally, education is the <br/>\nprovince of the states, and bills like this one force a conflict <br/>\nbetween the federal government and state governments.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhose long-range purposes are really being served with this bill?<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6<br/>\n  Date: Mon, 28 Jul 2003 17:28:34 -0400<br/>\n  From: &quot;kathryn nelson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:knelso2@...\">knelso2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Interscholastic sports?<br/>\n<br/>\nHello,<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve posted this message before on this board so please<br/>\nbare with me if I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n We live in New York State and my sons are home schooled.

I am a hs mom of 3.  I&#39;ve been<br/>\nhomeschooling over a year, almost two and using the<br/>\nCalvert curriculum.  I am concerned about my kids<br/>\nhaving friends besides their brothers and sister.  I<br/>\nhave been having a hard time finding other<br/>\nhomeschoolers in the area.  I know &quot;socialization&quot; is<br/>\nalways in the backs of homeschoolers&#39; minds, but it<br/>\ncan be a real fear for some, especially the not very<br/>\noutgoing people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if there are any other homeschoolers<br/>\nin Bowie?  I was also wondering if there are any<br/>\nspecial homeschooling days at the ice rink, gym, etc. <br/>\nIf not, do you want to try and start one?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the fall, when school goes back in session, I was<br/>\nthinking on starting up a Park day, get-together day,<br/>\netc.  Let me know if anyone is interested.  You can<br/>\nemail me privately or on list if you would like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have nay other ideas, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey <br/>\nHS Mom of three : 6, 4 and 2<br/>\nTell me and I&#39;ll forget. <br/>\nShow me, and I may not remember.<br/>\nInvolve me, and I&#39;ll understand.<br/>\nAuthor unknown<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

And second, who has the ultimate responsibility for<br/>\nensuring home-schooled students meet their potential?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question: Is this a common attitude or an anomaly amongst<br/>\nhomeschoolers?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got to type and run but I wanted to say that I don&#39;t think government<br/>\nshould have the final word.<br/>\n<br/>\nT.J.<br/>\n&quot;It is better to tolerate that rare instance of a parent&#39;s refusing to let<br/>\nhis child be educated, than to shock the common feelings by a forcible<br/>\ntransportation and education of the infant against the will of his father.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/thomas_jefferson_6_00.htm#\">http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/thomas_jefferson_6_00.htm#</a><br/>\n7<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, since when is it anyone&#39;s responsibility to ensure anyone meets his or<br/>\nher &#39;potential?&#39;  That word plagued me throughout my school &#39;career&#39; because<br/>\nI never measured up to it.  From whatever test I was given in 1st grade<br/>\nuntil I got the diploma I was hounded by people wanting me to work up to my<br/>\nwretched potential (the anomaly was poor grades contrasted against excellent<br/>\nstandardized test scores).  I didn&#39;t make &#39;them&#39; happy and &#39;they&#39; certainly<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make me happy.

These are some of the most destructive<br/>\nand abusive phrases used on children -- and they can have a lifelong impact!<br/>\nI was labeled an underachiever almost as soon as I started school.  I<br/>\nconstantly heard that I was not living up to my potential, that my test<br/>\nscores indicated that I should be working a year ort two above grade level.<br/>\nNone of my teachers was bright enough to realize that I was a year younger<br/>\nthan all my classmates -- I started school when I was 4 -- and therefore<br/>\nautomatically working above grade level.  My fourth grade teacher gave me<br/>\nC&#39;s on all my math papers -- I got all the problems correct but she said I<br/>\nwas able to do sixth grade work so it wasn&#39;t fair to give me the same grade<br/>\nas the other kids in the class -- for the same work.  I was -- of course --<br/>\nnever given the opportunity to do 6th grade work that year -- but......  An<br/>\nhonors math teacher at the highschool in our neighborhood -- we know him<br/>\nwell -- uses the same book and assignments for his honors classes as for his<br/>\nregular classes -- but gives the honors students one letter grade lower --<br/>\nhurting their chances to get into college.  It all just drives me crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n  Date: Tue, 29 Jul 2003 04:19:50 -0000<br/>\n  From: &quot;shantinik&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shantinik@...\">shantinik@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Pittsburgh, southern Michigan, Columbus - Aug. 14-16<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m doing a mini-speaking tour Aug. 14-16th -- if you come to hear<br/>\nme, be sure to tell me you are on this list!
