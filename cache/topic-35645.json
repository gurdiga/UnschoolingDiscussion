I was willing <br/>\nto let her, but we talked about it pretty regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she wanted was to go because her friend across the street went.  But <br/>\nthey would not have been in the same grade.  So whenever we&#39;d pass an <br/>\nelementary during school hours, I would show her that only SOME of the kids <br/>\nwere out to play at any one time, and they weren&#39;t supposed to play with kids <br/>\nin other grades, or sometimes even in other classes.  And that the <br/>\nkindergarten kids never were mixed in with first graders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also told her that in school the other kids will tease each other a lot for <br/>\nplaying with kids in earlier grades, and that I was afraid Kellee wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nas nice to Holly in school, even if she had a chance, as she was when they <br/>\nplayed at each other&#39;s houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs evidence of that, I told her to notice how often kids in school ask new <br/>\nkids they meet &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;  She started noting that, and we <br/>\nwould discuss it.  Because my boys would say &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade,&quot; or &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t go to school,&quot; the other kids had to decide based solely on interest, <br/>\nmerit, &quot;playability,&quot; or personality!  They weren&#39;t used to that, really.  <br/>\nThey seemed more used to deciding whether to play based on that answer and <br/>\nthen all that was left was to determine dominance.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe started to see that for herself, and it helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe still isn&#39;t a fluent reader at ten, but she was precocious about <br/>\ninterpersonal stuff, and understands now things about parenting, sibling <br/>\nrelations, dynamics between friends that I didn&#39;t figure out until I was <br/>\ngrown.  I think it&#39;s mostly because I was not allowed in and out of real <br/>\nfamilies and mixed-age groups, because....  I was limited to kids in my own <br/>\ngrade, largely.

We live in one of those Illinois neighborhoods with no fences - so there are like twenty backyards connecting - 90% of those with kids who are our children&#39;s ages (11, 9, 3).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is wonderful that they have this park environment so close to home, and within view of many caring parents, but it is also extremely challenging with regards to homeschooling & unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nGino commented once that he wished he was learning more at home like he did in school.  This made no sense to me - he hated school - tantrummed all the time about it - before school / after school / during school.  A friend suggested the &quot;prisoner missing prison&quot; idea.  It made a lot of sense as he was in a &quot;special&quot; school that rewarded or consequenced behaviors every 5 minutes with a behavioral assessment chart (&quot;e&quot; for excellent, &quot;s&quot;,&quot;n&quot;, etc.).  We pulled him out in May of 2001, so we&#39;re coming up on one year - and this may still be a deschooling issue - especially since his &quot;school&quot; experiences were so extreme (behavioral hospital and school).<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, the kids asked if they could go back to school.  After recovering from my shock (and feeling rejected and hurt - yes, unfortunately I took it personal!!), I decided to probe a little deeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that Gino (9) didn&#39;t like waiting all day for his friends to come home at 4:00.  Solution : We talked about what actually occurs during the course of a typical &quot;school&quot; day.  He wasn&#39;t convinced and felt that he could, and wanted to try it.  I suggested trying a &quot;school type&quot; day at home to see how it would feel, and he agreed.  Literally ten minutes into the &quot;school&quot; day, he was complaining about the simple Math worksheet I gave him for &quot;Math&quot; time.  I explained that in school, you do not have a choice (as he well knows from his past school experiences).  That led to pounding on the floor, throwing the workbook, and shouting, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this - I want to do what I want to do!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking, &quot;YES Exactly!!&quot;, but I showed some restraint, said nothing, and he went off to play with his hot wheels.  Later he came back and we were able to talk.  We have scheduled more &quot;get togethers&quot; with other homeschoolers during the day, to try and satisfy his need to hang out with friends before 4:00 !<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel that he came away from the experience with a negative though - that he can&#39;t &quot;make it&quot; in school.  A sort of &quot;everybody else can do it but I can&#39;t&quot; mentality about the whole thing.  Perhaps there is a better way to handle these situations when they arise??<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my daughter Sabra (10, almost 11), it turns out that she thought she was homeschooling because she wasn&#39;t smart enough to succeed in school.  Of course she was pleased as punch when dh and I fell out of our chairs exclaiming, &quot;Sabra, you&#39;re not in school because you&#39;re TOO smart and precious to be there!!!&quot;   And believe me, she has been told this many times.  I think it may be a general worry that comes up from time to time that has more to do with not being like &quot;everyone else&quot;.  Maybe they experience some of the same insecurities / doubts that I do from time to time - in which case I need to get my thing together and be clear on my own views.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing (of many) my children taught me is that I need to be talking, talking, and talking some more about these ideas, and all sorts of others!  We talk all the time - but I was still surprised to find out what kind of ideas were lurking in their heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nShelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bonknit@...\">bonknit@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 21, 2002 12:54 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] New question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all, I am new here, have been lurking for a few days and reading the <br/>\n  recent discussions.   <br/>\n      My question is How do you deal with others as you move towards an <br/>\n  unschooling lifestyle? How about when it&#39;s the kids themselves that keep <br/>\n  telling you they are not learning anything when you know they are? My kids <br/>\n  had previously been in school and play with kids who go to school so I know <br/>\n  where some of the flack comes from but it is still so hard to deal with. It <br/>\n  makes me feel phony when I try to explain to them how them doing this or that <br/>\n  is math or history, etc. <br/>\n      Please also help me to find ways to move dh along. BTW, my kids are 11 <br/>\n  and 14, both boys.<br/>\n  Laura<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
