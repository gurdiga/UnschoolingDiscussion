He<br/>\nprefers to<br/>\nwear slip-on boots most of the time, because it&#39;s easier. I&#39;m not too<br/>\nworried though, as there are other options (i.e. boots, slip-on shoes),<br/>\nand<br/>\nthere&#39;s also velcro :) But hey, he&#39;s okay with math, can read well, and<br/>\nhis<br/>\nalways happy --that&#39;s what&#39;s really important to me anyway. If he gets<br/>\nto<br/>\n35 and still can&#39;t tie his shoes, well, he can just live in a yurt and<br/>\ngo<br/>\nbarefooted. LOL<br/>\nTodd***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Todd - My 7 1/2 yr old son doesn&#39;t know how to tie his shoes<br/>\neither , he wears clogs or sandals (we&#39;re in California, no truly cold<br/>\nweather here).  It doesn&#39;t matter, he&#39;s a good kid, loves to read, is<br/>\nkind, generous and very spiritual.  We&#39;re happy with him just the way he<br/>\nis (although we have given him a nickname also - Robin bobbin).<br/>\n<br/>\nBarefoot!  The calluses on the bottom of my feet are enormous from being<br/>\nbarefoot most of my life.  My kids are welcome to join me, and they do<br/>\nmost of the time (bare feet and bare bodies).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he chooses to live in a yurt, I&#39;ll be the first to visit, I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways wanted to live in one.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t like to wear shoes or socks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45941,"nextTopicId":45959}}
