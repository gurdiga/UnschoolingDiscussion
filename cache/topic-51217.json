It&#39;s just a reminder of the <br/>\npower of phrases and a reminder for us to dissect language sometimes to stir <br/>\nout those lumps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes a phrase, especially if it was used on us as an insult or put-down, <br/>\ntends to take on a life of its own, a reality without basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing happens with &quot;spoiled brat&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re letting your kids run all <br/>\nover you,&quot; and &quot;How will they learn?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPhrases become rock-hard pain to be avoided sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of thinking of it as whether you will or will not be a short-order <br/>\ncook, how about trying to never think that question ever again.  Just banish <br/>\nit.  Shove it down.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, think of what the value of being satisfied is.  Physically <br/>\nsatisfied.  Nourished.  Full.  Not needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child feels needy or unsatisfied, an insult won&#39;t satisfy him.<br/>\nMy mom tried that.  She failed dozens of times, but saw it as a failing in <br/>\nME, not in her.<br/>\nShe told me, when I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; variants from &quot;No you&#39;re not&quot; to &quot;You <br/>\nhave never been hungry a day in your life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably she heard those things from her parents, and rather than really <br/>\nthink about what it might mean to me to have my mother hand me some food with <br/>\na smile and a hug, she decided she didn&#39;t HAVE to do that, and maybe she <br/>\ncould train me to stop asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51216,"nextTopicId":50940}}
