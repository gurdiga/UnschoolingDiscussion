But, here it goes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We give our son, who is five, $5 a week allowance or whatever you want to<br/>\ncall it.  We just say spending money.  He gets at this point a $1 per week<br/>\nfor his age.  No reason, it just worked out that way.  It seems to be a good<br/>\namount for him at this point.  We want him to learn to budget and save for<br/>\nthings he wants in  a realistic way.  He saves for big items and buys small<br/>\nthings that he wants, he has control over what he buys and when.  And has<br/>\nreally learned the value of money and what is a good value and what will<br/>\nfall apart.  He no longer buys impulsively at the dollar store, because it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t last as long as other things.  We only have one child, so we can give<br/>\nhim this much.  Dh and I both get a set amount to spend each week, (when we<br/>\nare on our budget, sometimes), so it is within the context of our family.<br/>\nHe does not have to do chores or anything to get this money, it is his as<br/>\nbeing part of the family.  He doesn&#39;t loose it as punishment or anything<br/>\nlike that.  Actually, if<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, we have friends who don&#39;t give their kids any money unless they earn<br/>\nit.  And I mean they earn it.  Cleaning out the cat box for 25 cents etc...<br/>\ndoing things for a dime or nickel.   They rarely can save for anything<br/>\nsubstantial.  Well, today, we were shopping at Sam&#39;s and my friend&#39;s<br/>\ndaughter wanted a book.  (I always buy books whenever he wants them).  She<br/>\nwas told &quot;you only have 92 cents left, you spent your money on beads.&quot;  Then<br/>\nshe tells me she saved for a month for that little bag of beads and was so<br/>\nproud when she finally earned enough for it.  (this family does have a<br/>\nlittle money to spend, so that&#39;s not the issue, my friend buys stuff all the<br/>\ntime, impulsively).  Anyhow, Ben said, &quot;how much do I have?&quot;  (he left his<br/>\nat home) I said &quot;fifteen dollars&quot;.  He chose not to buy anything and wanted<br/>\nto keep saving for a new Lego set that costs $40.  Anyhow, it was an issue<br/>\nfor my friend.  She doesn&#39;t want her daughter to have money or want things,<br/>\nbut of course she does.  She th<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I was 12 or so, I was given $3 a week.  They wouldn&#39;t give me more<br/>\nfor an allowance, because it seemed wrong for me to get  a bigger allowance.<br/>\nIt was also tied to behavior or chores (another issue).  Anyhow, I went<br/>\nskating every week.  It costs $3 to get in.  The skates were 50 cents and I<br/>\nneeded pocket money for drinks and a snack.  So, my parents ended up giving<br/>\nme more money when I asked, but I had to ask for it, or beg for it and maybe<br/>\nearn it if they felt like it.  And I did other things during the week and<br/>\ngot more here and there.  Fast forward to the future, and there I have<br/>\ncredit problems and they don&#39;t understand how.  Duh, I got the sense that<br/>\nthere was always more if I asked, begged, or manipulated to get it.  If I<br/>\nhad just been given enough to budget for the week, then I would have learned<br/>\nthat I get a certain amount, and then it&#39;s gone.  But, give me enough to<br/>\nwork with.  I babysat, but wasn&#39;t allowed to charge very much, because that<br/>\nwould be wrong too.  It took<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, we want him to learn to save for what he wants and to work with a<br/>\nbudget.  And, it helps with impulse items.  Like the other day, we were in<br/>\nthe store and he wanted me to buy him a water.  I offered to take him to the<br/>\nfountain for a drink in a minute or two, when I was done with the deli.  He<br/>\nsaid he wanted the water now and pointed to a machine selling it.  I told<br/>\nhim he was free to buy the water himself with his own money, or he could<br/>\nwait a minute and I would take him to the fountain and he could have it for<br/>\nfree.  He chose to wait.  Most of the time, if he has to spend it out of his<br/>\nown pocket, he considers it carefully.  Now, if he had to save and earn<br/>\nevery cent for months, I could not ask him to buy a water for himself.  He<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to buy everything btw.  But, it helps at the candy aisle.

I can understand why it&#39;s hard for your friend to understand where<br/>\nyou are coming from but really the issue is hers and not yours.

Maybe upon considering it, she<br/>\nmight relax her view.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThese unschooling lists have helped me to relax a little more about money<br/>\nwith the kids.  I&#39;ve given them an unconditional allowance for a long time<br/>\nbut I was way more uptight on saying yes to a candy bar or other small item<br/>\nif they weren&#39;t willing to spend their allowance on it.  I think I had an<br/>\nidea in my head that if I impulsively bought them too much that they would<br/>\nbecome ask for stuff endlessly and not appreciate it.   I now say yes way<br/>\nmore often if it&#39;s a reasonable request and isn&#39;t going to break the bank.<br/>\nThey do ask a little more for small things, but probably at first, just to<br/>\nsee if I&#39;ll say yes. It&#39;s so nice to see their faces light up when I say<br/>\nyes.  They&#39;ve also understood when I&#39;ve said no, we&#39;ve really already spent<br/>\ntoo much this week and it&#39;s really adding up.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAngela <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] money and kids-long","postDate":"1094193329","msgId":99006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcyRkQzNEMwLUZENzMtMTFEOC1CN0M1LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMmUwMWM0OTE2OSQ1MGNhNWYxMCQ2ZjYzMDgwNEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTAyMTY1NjQzLk9LRVMyNDY5My5tdGExMy5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+IDwwMDJlMDFjNDkxNjkkNTBjYTVmMTAkNmY2MzA4MDRAeW91cm8wa3drdzlqd2M+"},"prevInTopic":99004,"nextInTopic":99009,"prevInTime":99005,"nextInTime":99007,"topicId":99004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think you have any problem happening, Laura.

We just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1817663210\">I&#39;ve got probably a sticky subject to bring up.  But, here it goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe give our son, who is five, $5 a week allowance or whatever you want to call it.  We just say spending money.  He gets at this point a $1 per week for his age.  No reason, it just worked out that way.  It seems to be a good amount for him at this point.  We want him to learn to budget and save for things he wants in  a realistic way.  He saves for big items and buys small things that he wants, he has control over what he buys and when.  And has really learned the value of money and what is a good value and what will fall apart.  He no longer buys impulsively at the dollar store, because it didn&#39;t last as long as other things.  We only have one child, so we can give him this much.  Dh and I both get a set amount to spend each week, (when we are on our budget, sometimes), so it is within the context of our family.  He does not have to do chores or anything to get this money, it is his as being part of the family.  He doesn&#39;t loose it as punishment or anything like that.  Actually, if he still has not spent it by Sunday, he gets a $1 interest.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we have friends who don&#39;t give their kids any money unless they earn it.  And I mean they earn it.  Cleaning out the cat box for 25 cents etc... doing things for a dime or nickel.   They rarely can save for anything substantial.  Well, today, we were shopping at Sam&#39;s and my friend&#39;s daughter wanted a book.  (I always buy books whenever he wants them).  She was told &quot;you only have 92 cents left, you spent your money on beads.&quot;  Then she tells me she saved for a month for that little bag of beads and was so proud when she finally earned enough for it.  (this family does have a little money to spend, so that&#39;s not the issue, my friend buys stuff all the time, impulsively).  Anyhow, Ben said, &quot;how much do I have?&quot;  (he left his at home) I said &quot;fifteen dollars&quot;.  He chose not to buy anything and wanted to keep saving for a new Lego set that costs $40.  Anyhow, it was an issue for my friend.  She doesn&#39;t want her daughter to have money or want things, but of course she does.  She thinks giving kids money makes them materialistic.  I think kids need money just like everyone else and it helps them learn good money sense.  My friend and her dh have terrible money issues themselves.  It bothered her that Ben has so much money and her daughter didn&#39;t.  I started giving him money when he was 2.  She thought that was awful.  Her daughter didn&#39;t understand why Ben had so much and got really upset in the store, &quot;that&#39;s not fair&quot;.  Then asking me why Ben got so much more than she did.  I said ask your mom.  My friend made a comment that I overheard something like &quot;well, we don&#39;t just hand you money, like they do Ben, you have to learn that you must earn your money like everyone else by working really hard.  You are going to learn lessons that he isn&#39;t learning&quot;.  Hhmmmm.  She does have major control issues to begin with.  That&#39;s another story. I think I heard her once charge her daughter a fine for something she did.  OH, and she&#39;s only 4.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 12 or so, I was given $3 a week.  They wouldn&#39;t give me more for an allowance, because it seemed wrong for me to get  a bigger allowance.  It was also tied to behavior or chores (another issue).  Anyhow, I went skating every week.  It costs $3 to get in.  The skates were 50 cents and I needed pocket money for drinks and a snack.  So, my parents ended up giving me more money when I asked, but I had to ask for it, or beg for it and maybe earn it if they felt like it.  And I did other things during the week and got more here and there.  Fast forward to the future, and there I have credit problems and they don&#39;t understand how.  Duh, I got the sense that there was always more if I asked, begged, or manipulated to get it.  If I had just been given enough to budget for the week, then I would have learned that I get a certain amount, and then it&#39;s gone.  But, give me enough to work with.  I babysat, but wasn&#39;t allowed to charge very much, because that would be wrong too.  It took awhile for me to learn a need from a want.  And my 5 year old has a sense of it already.  Delayed gratification also.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we want him to learn to save for what he wants and to work with a budget.  And, it helps with impulse items.  Like the other day, we were in the store and he wanted me to buy him a water.  I offered to take him to the fountain for a drink in a minute or two, when I was done with the deli.  He said he wanted the water now and pointed to a machine selling it.  I told him he was free to buy the water himself with his own money, or he could wait a minute and I would take him to the fountain and he could have it for free.  He chose to wait.  Most of the time, if he has to spend it out of his own pocket, he considers it carefully.  Now, if he had to save and earn every cent for months, I could not ask him to buy a water for himself.  He doesn&#39;t have to buy everything btw.  But, it helps at the candy aisle.  I tell him we have lots of candy at home, or he can buy something here with his own money.  Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  I think we are doing well with this.  It is well thought out and I think makes the most sense.  I have this issue with other friends.  He gets more than most other kids we know.  They think we are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, from an unschooling parenting point of view, what do you all think about this issue?  Sorry so long, I got chatty and had lots to say about this issue.
