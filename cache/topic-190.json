They have finally realized that we<br/>\nare serious about this &quot;homeschooling thing.&quot; They have no comprehension<br/>\nof unschooling and I have no reason to try an explain it to them.<br/>\nMy husband and I tend to balk at anything to schoolish which runs the<br/>\ngamut from workbooks to meetings. We are a very laid back family and I&#39;m<br/>\nsure most would think we just play all day. Which we actually do. We are<br/>\nvery confident in ourselves as parents and more importantly in our<br/>\nchildren. We have never had any doubts that this is what is best for us<br/>\nas a family. We are fortunate to be surrounded by other unschooling<br/>\nfamilies with older children and also have encountered some wonderful<br/>\nyoung adults who have been homeschooled.

We <br/>\nbegan last summer, after his 3rd-grade year, and not much has changed in our <br/>\nlives other than the fact that we have way more time to do all the things we <br/>\nwant to do! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have 18 and 20yo sons, and I&#39;ve wanted to homeschool since the oldest <br/>\nwas ready for Kindergarten.....it was always in my heart, but we just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get things in a row until now, I guess, but I&#39;m so thankful we <br/>\nfinally did!

My husband is a behavior <br/>\ntherapist at a school for autistic children, which is a blessing in so many <br/>\nways; his schedule is very flexible, so the three of us spend a great deal of <br/>\ntime together (the older boys aren&#39;t living at home, so it&#39;s kind of like <br/>\nhaving an only child - a totally different stage :)  Our 10yo goes to work <br/>\nwith my husband one (and sometimes more) day a week as a &quot;peer&quot; or &quot;model&quot;, <br/>\nand works with the kids; he loves it, and they all love him - therapists and <br/>\nkids alike!  I think it&#39;s such an incredible experience for him, and how <br/>\nfortunate are we to be able to do things like that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean for this to be so long (should have posted it under the <br/>\n&quot;rambling&quot; thread LOL)  I&#39;m on a ton of homeschool email lists, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nwaited for this one for a month or so - I was so excited when I found it <br/>\nyesterday!  I just signed on late last night, and when I came online tonight <br/>\nand saw so many messages I was thrilled - I&#39;ve caught myself up now (with <br/>\nthis list, anyway - my son was in a computer-mood today, so I had a rare day <br/>\noffline and my mailbox is overflowing!) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else from Florida?  I&#39;d love to meet another homeschooler, something <br/>\nwe&#39;ve never done!<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m done.....for now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda in FL :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":379,"nextTopicId":327}}
