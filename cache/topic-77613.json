But<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; experiences seem locked up like rocks until someone identifies the<br/>\nindividual<br/>\n&gt; parts of them for you somehow.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s how it seems to me, anyway.  If it never occurred to &quot;an A<br/>\nstudent,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for example that each A they got kept someone else from being top, they<br/>\nmight<br/>\n&gt; never have thought of how important it might have been for the person who<br/>\nkept<br/>\n&gt; coming in second or third to be first JUST ONCE.  Of it might never have<br/>\n&gt; occurred to someone who was great in gym or sports that other kids might<br/>\nhave been<br/>\n&gt; trying MUCH harder and wanting success MUCH more, but just didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; talent.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Reviewing those kinds of things in new light can make it EASY in some ways<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; see what unschooled kids need and need to avoid, and what we can say or<br/>\npoint<br/>\n&gt; out to them to help them be compassionate about other kids&#39; relative<br/>\ntalents<br/>\n&gt; and successes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some people&#39;s childhood memories are almost completely closed off, and so<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t have that to draw on and are somewhat at a disadvantage in<br/>\n&gt; understanding what kids are thinking and feeling.   It&#39;s better if you can<br/>\nremember being<br/>\n&gt; eight instead of just trusting that you must have been, and having a<br/>\nphoto,<br/>\n&gt; but no real memories.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s one thing to just quote a person.  It&#39;s a whole other thing to filter<br/>\n&gt; your memories through their words or ideas so that you end up maybe saying<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; same things, only behind the words you have vivid real KNOWLEDGE of how<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; worked (or didn&#39;t) in your life and how it is working in your child&#39;s<br/>\nlife.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 10<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 24 Jul 2003 13:26:34 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: name calling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;On another network&quot;  it is being claimed that on this list people are<br/>\n&gt; &quot;called names.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been called names.  But usually by people who aren&#39;t being very<br/>\n&gt; rational, so I don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any &quot;names&quot; people have been called to throw out here so<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt; can consider whether that claim is true?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The claim was (I think, from what I was forwarded) that the main core of<br/>\n&gt; people here (? or just me?  me and some?) call people names, and that it&#39;s<br/>\nall in<br/>\n&gt; the archives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, and since there are some people on both lists, I<br/>\n&gt; thought if it IS true, people here should be easily able to name those<br/>\nkinds of<br/>\n&gt; names people have been called.   I know I&#39;ve said lots of times that some<br/>\n&gt; recommended or proposed action or behavior wasn&#39;t the closest way to get<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.  I can&#39;t think of times it involved calling a person a name.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Without quoting who and to whom, can we come up with a list of these names<br/>\n&gt; people have been called?   If it&#39;s true, I&#39;m just losing my memory, I<br/>\nguess.<br/>\n&gt; Help!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 11<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 24 Jul 2003 13:51:37 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Kelly Lenhart&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mina@...\">mina@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: childhood memories missing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Some people&#39;s childhood memories are almost completely closed off, and so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they don&#39;t have that to draw on and are somewhat at a disadvantage in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understanding what kids are thinking and feeling.   It&#39;s better if you<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; remember being<br/>\n&gt; &gt;eight instead of just trusting that you must have been, and having a<br/>\nphoto,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but no real memories.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You know, I never thought about this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have almost no memories of elementary school age and younger.  My<br/>\nparents<br/>\n&gt; split when I was in fifth grade, and I remember that.  I remember the<br/>\nplaces<br/>\n&gt; we lived before that and the people who lived near, but not much more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Part of it, I feel, is that I had no sibs then, to back up my memories.  I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t get sibs until my mom remarried and had my first brother when I was<br/>\n&gt; 19.  (At 36 I have 17 and 14 year old brothers (mom&#39;s) and an almost 12<br/>\nyear<br/>\n&gt; old sister (dad&#39;s))<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But I also just don&#39;t remember much of anything before the day my folks<br/>\n&gt; brought me in and said Dad was moving out.  Oh, and my mom swears I<br/>\nactually<br/>\n&gt; helped my dad move into his bachelor pad.  Uhm, ok Mom, I beleive you<br/>\n&gt; but....NOTHING!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s what, no real memories from before age 10?  My husband talks<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; remembering Kindergarten and earlier.  Nope, not me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wonder how much of that has to do with not being able to get into the<br/>\nhead<br/>\n&gt; of my 7 year old sometimes.   Weird, I just never put the two together.<br/>\n&gt; Have to really think about this.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Gee, thanks Sandra!  -grin-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
