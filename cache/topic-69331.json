My children also have these intense feelings sometimes and all I can do is acknowledge them and talk about my beliefs and what other people believe. These conversations usually go on for a few days or weeks and then without ever resolving the problem, we move on.  I guess the thing is we never can resolve it. We can acknowledge that we are all afraid of death and be open and honest with our children about it but there is no real reassurance we can give them without resorting to platitudes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69245,"nextTopicId":69335}}
