I can&#39;t blame the doctor <br/>\nentirely for my decision not to breastfeed.  Afterall, I like to think I&#39;m a <br/>\nfairly intelligent person - I could have looked for answers elsewhere.  Maybe <br/>\nI didn&#39;t care enough about breastfeeding at the time to make the effort - I <br/>\nreally can&#39;t remember the circumstances exactly.  I do know that I was most <br/>\ncertainly too trusting of doctors.  That was ten years ago, and I&#39;m sorry to <br/>\nsay that I remained too trusting until 14 months ago when my youngest child <br/>\nwas born.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  My first daughter was delivered by c-section 12 years ago.  I wanted to <br/>\nhave the next one vaginally, so I chose a doctor who would be open to that <br/>\nwhen I became pregnant with my second child.  The delivery went okay - major <br/>\ntearing, but my son was a healthy 8 1/2 pounder.  The next baby was also born <br/>\nvaginally.  That delivery didn&#39;t go so well - my daughter was stuck (shoulder <br/>\ndystocia) although I didn&#39;t know it at the time.  Actually, I didn&#39;t know it <br/>\nuntil almost five years later when my youngest was born.  Luckily, the doctor <br/>\nwas able to turn her and she was delivered healthy, weighing 8lbs 6oz.  Major <br/>\ntearing again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy fourth child was born exactly 14 months ago tomorrow.  My pregnancy with <br/>\nher was pretty uneventful - I did gain a lot of weight, but the all knowing <br/>\ndoctor never said anything about it, so I assumed it was no problem.  Two <br/>\ndays past my due date the doctor decided to induce labor.  He had induced the <br/>\nlast two because he didn&#39;t want the babies to get over 8 1/2 pounds - he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t think I could deliver one any bigger.  He&#39;d already told me that the <br/>\nbaby I was carrying was in the 9 pound range, so things weren&#39;t adding up.  <br/>\nBut I TRUSTED him, afterall he&#39;s the doctor.  My labor with the fourth one <br/>\nseemed different from the start.  At one point I heard the nurse talking to <br/>\nthe doctor on the phone.  She told him that she thought he neede to come <br/>\nright away.  But did he?  NO.  He came about 45 minutes or an hour later.  <br/>\nThe nurse had just discovered that &quot;this baby&#39;s head is way bigger than I <br/>\nthought&quot;.  But her head wasn&#39;t the worst part - it was her shoulders.  <br/>\nShoulder dystocia again...only this time I don&#39;t remember him trying the <br/>\nfancy turns or maneuveres.  She was STUCK!  So, the doctor put a nurse on <br/>\neach side of me, to pull my legs as far back as they possibly could.  I had <br/>\ntwo other nurses on top of me, pushing on my belly with all their might.  And <br/>\nthe doctor had the vacuum extractor hooked to my baby&#39;s head and was pulling <br/>\nso hard that later my husband told me &quot; I thought he was going to pull her <br/>\ndamn head off&quot;!  He said it was the scariest thing he&#39;s ever seen.  Well, we <br/>\ngot the baby out.  She weighed 9 1/2 pounds.  She was a funny blue color, and <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t breathe for what seemed like forever.  I&#39;ll never forget the sound <br/>\nof her first cry, or the tears of relief in my sweet husband&#39;s eyes, or her <br/>\nwonderful new baby smell.  But somehow I failed to notice that her left arm <br/>\nwas hanging limp.  I didn&#39;t even realize it until late that night.  No one <br/>\ntold us she was hurt, and when we figured it out nobody would tell us what <br/>\nthe problem was. We didn&#39;t fully understand what had happened until we got <br/>\nhome and began our own research.  My daughter, Tess has a brachial plexus <br/>\ninjury.  Maybe some of you know what that is, but I had never heard of it <br/>\nuntil she was born.  The brachial plexus is the bundle of nerves found in the <br/>\nshoulder area. The nerves are the ones that control muscle function in the <br/>\narm.  The nerves that control Tess&#39;s bicep and deltoid muscles were torn.  <br/>\nThe tricep nerve was also injured, but not as seriously.  There is a <br/>\nwonderful clinic in Houston, Texas where they specialize in brachial plexus <br/>\ninjuries.  We&#39;ve traveled there several times, and she  had surgery at Texas <br/>\nChildren&#39;s Hospital last September to graft the torn nerves, using bits of <br/>\nnerve taken from her leg.  We were told by her pediatrician that there is <br/>\nnothing that can be done for nerve injuries.   We had to learn everything we <br/>\nknow about it on our own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTess also has mild hypotonia (low muscle tone)  probably due do a slight lack <br/>\nof oxygen, and hip dysplasia, which will hopefully be resolved soon.  My <br/>\ndaughter was perfectly healthy up until the moment she was born.  She was <br/>\nPERFECT.  And now thanks to some know it all, egotistical, rushing to the <br/>\ngolf course doctor she&#39;s injured for life.  Oh, they can fix her up (or, so <br/>\nthey say)  but even with the best recovery, she&#39;ll never be the way she <br/>\nshould have been.  And here&#39;s the really sad part...it all could have been <br/>\nprevented.  All the warning signs were there - previous shoulder dystocia, <br/>\nlarge weight gain, big baby etc...  See why I&#39;ll never again take a doctor&#39;s <br/>\nword on anything?  I&#39;ll question them every step of the way - it could be a <br/>\nmatter of life and death.  What a way to learn a lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve gone on way too long here, and for that I&#39;m very sorry.  I&#39;m not <br/>\neven sure if I made the point I set out to make - I got kind of side tracked. <br/>\n But it&#39;s late, and I&#39;m much too tired to change anything now.  Goodnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7928,"nextTopicId":7930}}
