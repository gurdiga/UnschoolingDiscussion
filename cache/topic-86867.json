Or does it make it more confusing?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When people new to unschooling bring up teaching, they are thinking in<br/>\nterms<br/>\n&gt; of the teacher as separate from the learner. Helping people picture how a<br/>\n&gt; teacher can learn while teaching doesn&#39;t help someone figure out how to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;get&quot; (since that may be their mindset at the time) their kids to learn.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s an answer to a question they aren&#39;t asking. In fact it&#39;s an answer<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; looks like it suggests that teaching a child is still okay.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just because a point of view is true, doesn&#39;t mean discussing it helps<br/>\n&gt; someone understand unschooling. It *is* often hard to keep in mind how a<br/>\n&gt; discussion will affect someone who is trying to understand unschooling but<br/>\n&gt; that *is* the purpose of the list.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; However, I don&#39;t agree that &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;choose to&quot; are necessarily on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; different planes because what people have said over and over (not just<br/>\nme)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is that they made the original choice and see it as very much a choice,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to keep that choice alive they &quot;have to&quot; do particular things. IF they<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a black belt, they MUST train.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How does discussing that help anyone unschool? That probably sounds like a<br/>\n&gt; snarky question, like it&#39;s code to say &quot;Shut up about this subject.&quot; But<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a serious question.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I want to get to some place that&#39;s 30 minutes away, I have to leave at<br/>\n&gt; least 30 mintues before I want to get there. It&#39;s just reality.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Well I could speed if my estimate of 30 minutes is based on going at the<br/>\n&gt; speed limit, but at some point that won&#39;t make up for real life<br/>\n&gt; limitations.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I want to unschool, I have to give up certain things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But people don&#39;t bring problems to the list that are based on not being<br/>\nable<br/>\n&gt; to recognize when they have to do something. The problems they bring are<br/>\n&gt; based on thinking they have to and not being able to recognize when they<br/>\n&gt; have a choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So can you bring up examples of when people&#39;s understanding of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; was hampered by not being able to recognize that reality has limitations?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In this situation, to discuss it from an unschooling point of view, there<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t anything that was clearer when expressed as have to. The have tos<br/>\n&gt; were limiting and suggestive to those still stuck with a lot of &quot;have tos&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in their lives that there was some pressure that was necessary for<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When problems are discussed on the list, the discussion is done with the<br/>\n&gt; idea that many people are reading along.
