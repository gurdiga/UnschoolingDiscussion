We had a good example here, last night, about how being sweet to<br/>\nkids makes them sweeter, not rotten.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I had had a pretty horrible day, with lots of driving in the<br/>\nstorm.  It was so awful and getting so close to sunset that I kept<br/>\nputting off and putting off the stop at McDonald&#39;s I had promised him. <br/>\nAny way, we had had some stress about food during the day, and I<br/>\nexplained and apologized, but didn&#39;t give my son what he wanted. (at<br/>\nthat time)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9:55pm, as I turned off Buffy and was getting ready to go to bed, my<br/>\nson told me he was hungry.  Fortunately he wanted something simple, soup<br/>\nfrom a can.  Unfortunately some of the carrots exploded in the microwave<br/>\nand when he saw the soup he said it looked yucky.  We brainstormed a bit<br/>\nabout him eating the soup in the dark or with his eyes closed so he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t judge it by its appearance, but that didn&#39;t seem feasible. <br/>\n(Danger of hot soup spills.)  I put extra effort into the problem<br/>\nsolving because I had our discussions here in mind.  I ended up spoon<br/>\nfeeding him while he kept his eyes shut.  (Moms who are opposed to<br/>\n&quot;indulgence&quot; might as well let out a shriek and stop reading right here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a really nice time.  My son really appreciated that I solved his<br/>\nproblem without huffing.  By about the fourth spoonful he said &quot;thanks,<br/>\nmom&quot; and by the eighth, or so, &quot;I love you.&quot;  He only ate about 12<br/>\nspoonfuls; it wasn&#39;t a big drain on my time.  At bedtime he was still<br/>\nfeeling appreciative and said &quot;You&#39;re the best mama a boy could have.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow those who feel that deprivation builds character are free to sniff<br/>\nat this story.  But it works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I want to take a minute to say &quot;thanks&quot; to the &quot;best email list a<br/>\ngirl could have.&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t have done it without you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] saying yes","postDate":"1031523554","msgId":43350,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5QTE4NUE2LjEyMUMlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzEzMjQ0NjcuMjU1OC43NTMxMy5tMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51694,"prevInTime":43349,"nextInTime":43351,"topicId":43350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"on 9/6/02 17:01, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com at ...
