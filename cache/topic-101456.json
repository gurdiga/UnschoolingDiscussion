He still had to take tests and write <br/>\npapers and reports but the load was lighter.  He knows that the <br/>\nclasses he&#39;s taking are just hoops (though he loves learning about <br/>\nnew subjects but he&#39;d rather just have dinner with the professors and <br/>\ndiscuss things :-) and he just wants to jump through them ASAP.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I figured I needed to change my train of thoughts and letting my <br/>\n&gt; kids &#39;learn as we go thru life&#39; but what I think makes it hard is <br/>\n&gt; trying not to compare my kids with their government-schooled <br/>\n&gt; cousins.
