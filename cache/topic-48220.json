I couldn&#39;t just say a certain age. <br/>\nAnd to think about it, I never really had an opportunity where I needed to <br/>\nthink about it!! If my kids don&#39;t want to go, they stay home, if they want <br/>\nto come, they get out of the car. Of course I do have the luxury of having a <br/>\n16 year old to watch them if no one wants to go with me and my mom is also <br/>\nin connected seperate living quarters. But I wouldn&#39;t leave any of my 3 <br/>\nyoungest in a car now without my oldest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Why wouldn&#39;t you feel comfortable leaving your kids 15 feet away?<br/>\nWhat if the car was locked, the air conditioning or heat was on<br/>\n(depending on the weather), and the children were instructed to not<br/>\nunlock for anyone but you?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t leave my younger ones in a car that was running, locked or not 15 <br/>\nfeet away or not. I&#39;ve seen and heard way too much to do that. If someone <br/>\nwanted to get into a locked car, they could do it less than 5 seconds. If <br/>\nthe car is running, they&#39;d be gone. Probable, no, possible, yes. If I border <br/>\non the paranoid side about this, I&#39;m okay with that. I live just a couple of <br/>\nmiles from where Adam Walsh was taken. I remember that very vividly and Tara <br/>\nwas just a little one then. I remember having to explain that to her when <br/>\nshe heard about it. I&#39;ll be paranoid and it works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t John Holt advocate allowing children home alone, or out<br/>\nwalking to the library alone, at very young ages?<br/>\nI know a lady who was reported for leaving her child in the car alone<br/>\nwhile she made a quick run into the store.  I think the oldest was<br/>\n10.  I think she was able to get rid of CYS after the first visit,<br/>\nbut it was still very stressful for her.<br/>\nSometimes you have to make decisions not based on what you think is<br/>\nok for your kids but based on what nosy people might or might not<br/>\nreport.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about the John Holt idea. And as far as making decisions based <br/>\non what other people think, I just don&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSurf the Web without missing calls!ï¿½Get MSN Broadband.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp\">http://resourcecenter.msn.com/access/plans/freeactivation.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47926,"nextTopicId":48142}}
