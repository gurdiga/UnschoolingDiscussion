If a trip to the park fits into the flow, <br/>\nterrific.  If it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s something to be dealt with too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot all errands can be accompanied by a trip to the park or whatever will <br/>\nmake it fun.  Sometimes it&#39;s just grocery shopping. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the Gameboy gets toted along, a book, some markers and paper, etc. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting that every outing should be made to be as miserable and <br/>\nboring as possible.  I&#39;m just saying that the outing sometimes cannot be <br/>\nrearranged to be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nNor do I think that every outing has to be a source of entertainment.  <br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s just a trip to the bank or the store.  Not every outing is <br/>\nentertaining.  To set that up as the expectation isn&#39;t real either.  <br/>\nSometimes the outing involves a planned or spontaneous stop at the beach -- <br/>\nsometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/9/2001 6:52:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sld29@...\">sld29@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nance,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m confused, why not make it palatable?  Why not turn *your* errand<br/>\n&gt; into something fun for the *child*?  Might as well make as much as<br/>\n&gt; possible win-win, right?  If your child wants to do something that<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t really interest you, do you bring along a book or a snack or<br/>\n&gt; your journal or something to make it a little better for you?  Why not<br/>\n&gt; offer this same courtesy to children?
