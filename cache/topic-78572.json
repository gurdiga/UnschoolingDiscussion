Regardless, my main point was that I don&#39;t <br/>\nsee anything wrong with a parent being concerned about their child&#39;s <br/>\nwell-being, and if a child is still not reading at a relatively late <br/>\nage, AND  he&#39;s been obviously trying very hard but still having <br/>\ngreat difficulty with it, it COULD (could! as in, probably not, but <br/>\nmaybe) be a sign of a physical or neurological problem that a parent <br/>\nneeds to have addressed. Again, obviously that scenario is rather <br/>\nrare, but we can&#39;t dismiss it completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I am extra sensitive to this possibility because I myself <br/>\nhave a visual handicap (I&#39;m blind in my right eye thanks to being <br/>\nborn with a congential cataract), so to me the possibility of a child <br/>\nhaving some sort of handicap is not merely theoretical, it&#39;s quite <br/>\npossible and maybe more so for my children since these things can <br/>\noften be hereditary. Now in my case, it obviously didn&#39;t affect my <br/>\nability to read, because I too was reading before age 2!

But I do think that it&#39;s unfair to assume that everyone who <br/>\nquestions whether reading is a truly natural process must somehow <br/>\nnot &quot;get&quot; unschooling. I think of myself as a fullblown, whole-<br/>\nhearted, John Holt-worshipping radical unschooler (and the only <br/>\nperson who is going to tell me otherwise has been dead for 18 years)--<br/>\nbut for the reasons that I&#39;ve stated in my posts, I do personally <br/>\nthink that reading needs to be &quot;taught,&quot; in a way. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow hold on, before people start flaming me or taking my words out of <br/>\ncontext, let me clarify that remark by saying that most people seem <br/>\nperfectly capable of teaching this to themselves!! BUT, there do seem <br/>\nto be some people who need a little extra help figuring it all out. <br/>\nWhere I believe the unschooling philosophy comes into play here is <br/>\nwhether the child is given the freedom to seek this help out on his <br/>\nown, or whether the parents get pushy and try to force instruction on <br/>\nthe child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child still wasn&#39;t reading when he was 13 or 14, I might be a <br/>\nbit concerned, and as a loving parent I might sit down with him and <br/>\nask him if he&#39;s having any specific difficulties, and ask him if he <br/>\nwould like any help. If he told me that he was fine and didn&#39;t want <br/>\nany help, then I would probably leave it at that. What I wouldn&#39;t do <br/>\nis start buying him phonics workbooks or sign him up for a reading <br/>\ntutor or anything like that, unless of course he asked me to. I would <br/>\nleave it up to HIM to decide if his inability to read was a concern <br/>\nto him, and what if anything he would like others to do to help him <br/>\nout. Maybe not everyone on this list agrees with that approach, but <br/>\nwho says that we all have to agree on every single thing? <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery philosophy, every movement, has room for differing opinions, <br/>\ndifferent interpretations, different methods of implementation. Does <br/>\neveryone in the Green Party agree on every single point? Does every <br/>\nMuslim pray the exact same way? Obviously there are a few basic <br/>\ntenets which are at the core of a philosophy and are pretty much <br/>\nundebatable, but there are plenty of other specifics which should be <br/>\nopen to evolving debate. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we want to label ourselves unschoolers we should probably all <br/>\nagree that learning in general is a natural process--that&#39;s a core <br/>\npart of the unschooling philosophy.  But, that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that we can&#39;t still debate (and disagree about) specifics, such <br/>\nas whether all human brains are equitably wired to easily decode <br/>\nwritten symbols for spoken language, and whether all brains are <br/>\nnaturally inclined to &quot;read&quot; symbols for music and math as well for <br/>\nthat matter. Those are legitimate questions to explore, and those who <br/>\nchoose to ponder such things shouldn&#39;t be written off as being un-<br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDeniz</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] &quot;What is unschooling?&quot; from Pat Farenga at GWS","postDate":"1060820745","msgId":78749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwLjMzZDQ4ZWVkLjJjNmMzMTA5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":78747,"nextInTopic":78755,"prevInTime":78748,"nextInTime":78750,"topicId":78572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/13/03 6:07:56 PM, grlynbl@aol.com writes:  Some folks may be using learn to read naturally as meaning learn to ...

Lately, the term ³unschooling² has come to be<br/>\n&gt; associated with the type of homeschooling that doesn¹t use a fixed curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; When pressed, I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to<br/>\n&gt; learn in the world, as their parents can comfortably bear. The advantage of<br/>\n&gt; this method is that it doesn¹t require you, the parent, to become someone<br/>\n&gt; else, i.e. a professional teacher pouring knowledge into child-vessels on a<br/>\n&gt; planned basis. Instead you live and learn together, pursuing questions and<br/>\n&gt; interests as they arise and using conventional schooling on an ³on demand²<br/>\n&gt; basis, if at all. This is the way we learn before going to school and the way<br/>\n&gt; we learn when we leave school and enter the world of work. So, for instance, a<br/>\n&gt; young child¹s interest in hot rods can lead him to a study of how the engine<br/>\n&gt; works (science), how and when the car was built (history and business), who<br/>\n&gt; built and designed the car (biography), etc. Certainly these interests can<br/>\n&gt; lead to reading texts, taking courses, or doing projects, but the important<br/>\n&gt; difference is that these activities were chosen and engaged in freely by the<br/>\n&gt; learner. They were not dictated to the learner through curricular mandate to<br/>\n&gt; be done at a specific time and place, though parents with a more hands-on<br/>\n&gt; approach to unschooling certainly can influence and guide their children¹s<br/>\n&gt; choices. Unschooling, for lack of a better term (until people start to accept<br/>\n&gt; ³living² as part and parcel of learning), is the natural way to learn.<br/>\n&gt; However, this does not mean unschoolers do not take traditional classes or use<br/>\n&gt; curricular materials when the student, or parents and children together,<br/>\n&gt; decide that this is how they want to do it. Learning to read or do quadratic<br/>\n&gt; equations are not ³natural² processes, but unschoolers nonetheless learn them<br/>\n&gt; when it makes sense to them to do so, not because they have reached a certain<br/>\n&gt; age or are compelled to do so by arbitrary authority. Therefore it isn¹t<br/>\n&gt; unusual to find unschoolers who are barely eight years old studying astronomy<br/>\n&gt; or who are ten years old and just learning to read.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From, Teach Your Own </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] spending time with children","postDate":"1060624527","msgId":78584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2ZC4yMDc0YzBjMS4yYzY5MzI4ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":78574,"nextInTopic":78613,"prevInTime":78583,"nextInTime":78585,"topicId":78572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess people can t get there unless they have Netscape (and even then, it s a weird go) so here, I ve swiped the article.
