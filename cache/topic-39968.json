He decided to fly to Texas, where he could meet with me (as NHEN<br/>\nMilitary Coordinator) and Laura Derrick, (NHEN board member living in Texas<br/>\ntoo).<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the discussion will be about the recent legislation giving<br/>\nhomeschoolers&#39; access to auxiliary services in overseas school facilities.<br/>\nMy goal in this particular conversation is to be sure that the requirements<br/>\nthat are going to be implemented to do this, are only applied to the<br/>\nhomeschoolers choosing to use these services.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Colonel Lynch is also interested in simply finding out more about<br/>\nhomeschooling in general. I think this is a very positive thing - and a<br/>\ngreat opportunity to give him information and clear up any misconceptions he<br/>\nmay have about homeschooling. I&#39;ve asked the NHEN Military contacts to send<br/>\nme any suggestions, comments, problems that they&#39;re encountering, and then<br/>\nI&#39;ll share it with Col. Lynch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a military homeschooling family, I&#39;d like to know if your<br/>\ninstallation is doing anything to help homeschoolers. Likewise, if your<br/>\ninstallation is making it difficult, I&#39;d like to know that too. I would<br/>\nreally like to give Colonel Lynch the chance to hear what&#39;s really happening<br/>\nout there - good and bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!
