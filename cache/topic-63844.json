So while we don&#39;t want the <br/>\ngovernment judging how or when we allow our children to learn, can we sit in <br/>\njudgement of others who are doing the same for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not dispute there are children who should not be homeschooled.  There <br/>\nare also children that are IN school that most certainly would be better off <br/>\nhomeschooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do the absolute best we can for our children.  Just because my morality is <br/>\ndifferent from someone elses I do not believe that I am in any was superior <br/>\nor that they are inferior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have hostility because of the way I was raised too, I try to let it go and <br/>\nnot judge others who truly believe in their hearts that they are doing the <br/>\nright thing for their children.  It&#39;s not mine to judge.  However, if they <br/>\nare starving or abusing their children then that&#39;s different.  That&#39;s against <br/>\nthe law and a crime, it&#39;s not against the law to teach one&#39;s children in <br/>\none&#39;s own way your own values.  They will grow up and learn on their own what <br/>\nis and isn&#39;t important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing, I think we all probably come to homeschooling/unschooling <br/>\nfor a variety of different reasons, different motivating factors, a final <br/>\nlast straw, a mother who knew since BEFORE she had children this would be her <br/>\ncourse, and everything in between.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make it wrong how we get here?  As long as we are doing the absolute <br/>\nbest we can for our child/children isn&#39;t that all you can do?  Is it the <br/>\nmotivation for the journey that&#39;s important or is it the journey itself that <br/>\nis THE most important thing for our children?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I don&#39;t think other unschoolers or homeschoolers are the enemy.  <br/>\nOthers might think differently, and that&#39;s OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Christians again","postDate":"1049992806","msgId":63898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjLjFiM2Q0NDI5LjJiYzZmODY2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":63896,"nextInTopic":63901,"prevInTime":63897,"nextInTime":63899,"topicId":63844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This was in my junk mail just now.

It&#39;s not a cult that controls the minds of the women <br/>\nand children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree about both sentences. Baptist in the past probably had as many variations as homeschooling does today.   I grew up Southern Baptist in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.    Member churches of the Southern Baptist Convention were &quot;stricter&quot;  than &quot;northern&quot; Baptists but not as fundamentalist as &quot;foot-washing Baptists&quot; or &quot;mountain Baptists&quot;  or even &quot;Independent Baptists&quot;.  Individual churches in the Southern Baptist Convention were independent and individuals WITHIN those churches were also expected to be independently accountable for interpretations of the Bible and for church government structure.   The churches were joined together for political and financial purposes (such as providing support for &quot;missionaries&quot;) or even occasional lobbying at local, state, or federal levels (and not all members agreed on all issues but they were indeed asked whether they wished to join in on different issues).   In some churches and within the church culture there was indeed sometimes an appearance of &quot;cultism&quot; (a concept not easily recognized then)  but  in many churches there was also an empowering of women and children far beyond some Protestant denominations.   For example, I had a full vote in church decisions while still a 10 year old female. These decisions could include whether to accept someone into &quot;full fellowship&quot;  either &quot;by promise of letter&quot;  or &quot;profession of faith&quot;; or to &quot;withdraw fellowship&quot; from those who had lost their way.   Even a full vote in determining whether a particular person had indeed been &quot;called&quot; to lead the congregation as a pastor, minister of music, or youth leader.  As well as a vote in determining the salary of church workers and where a particular &quot;love offering&quot;  would be sent. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere WAS an expectation of &quot;witnessing&quot; to the &quot;unsaved&quot;  as well as being careful about getting &quot;unequally yoked&quot;,  just as there were rife rumors about the practices of other denominations but there was not the current structure of having a very large organization placing particular faith and action requirements on individual churches or even national &quot;leaders&quot; claiming authority over individuals within or without a particular church congregation.   Evangelists and revivals, yes......but always with an awareness that as Baptists there was no earthly intermediary between  God/Jesus  and the individual.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find today&#39;s Southern Baptist Churches to be WAY more intolerant than some strict Baptists of 25 years ago.   Also, with the admonition that schools AND colleges expecting support within the convention are permitted to hire only teachers  who support Biblical Inerrancy (as interpreted by leaders and not individuals),   I find it hard to escape the perception that there is certainly an attempt to control the minds of children and youth. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my take on the &quot;organized&quot; Baptists of today.  Of course anyone can say &quot;I am a Baptist&quot;  just as easily as saying &quot;I homeschool&quot;.   It is when certain individuals or small groups claim the authority to define the meaning of either term and heavily proselytize the one true way that big problems arise. <br/>\n<br/>\nVicki <br/>\nP.S.:  I agree that those who object to the phrase &quot;homeschool BECAUSE you are a fundamentalist Christian&quot; need to educate themselves via personal research.  And also agree with Kelly that stating &quot;&gt; No one group of people is hurting homeschooling anymore than another group. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; One group might be more VOCAL about how/why they homeschool than others but <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; is the REASON really what&#39;s important?&quot;   to be a very definite indicator that more historical research is needed.    <br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rubyprincesstsg@...\">rubyprincesstsg@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, April 10, 2003 7:44 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Christians again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m Christian too, I grew up very strict Baptist, the church is NOT the same <br/>\n  as it was 25 years ago.

Let me weigh in here.<br/>\nFirst off, You will find zealots in any and ALL religion, belief structures, no matter where that will make it an automatic turn off. It happened to me. For years I refused to set foot into a church. I felt that they were all just a bunch of Sunday Christians and every day devils. At least that is how the majority of so called Christians I met acted. My current church is so much different and I do thank God that I was able to find it. But I think the thing that people miss and forget is that Jesus was not teaching a religion as He was a way of life. The same holds true for ANY belief system. It is a way of life that most people forget and that&#39;s what leads to all the conflicts and hypocrisies that we are all witness to each day.<br/>\nAnother thing is a total and complete lack of information and down right ignorance. I LOVE to learn and be exposed to different belief structures. You get to see just how everything is interconnected on the most basic of levels. We each believe in an omniscient, omnipotent being who bestows love and peace and guidance unto the followers of the belief structure. But I am digressing here, :o)<br/>\nAs for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get spanked once a month the get spanked a lot. Besides it does not work all the time and with each child. For my son, I have to put him in a corner and let him have time to reflect on what he has done. Within a minute I get an attitude adjustment from him. For the older children I take away something they like or revoke something. That gets their attention in no time flat. The little one, with certain things I am still finding her threshold. She is stubborn one and can try the patience of a saint when she is ready. But I feel it has its place. I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he does not like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the disciplinarian, he just respectfully bows out, :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let a bad experience with one group of Christians make you feel that all are crazy belt toting wild eyed people who beat their children at the drop of a hat for no good reason. We are out here and find moderation for what we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that there are wiccans here? I have been trying to find out more about that belief system. I am not looking to convert mind you, but I am just fascinated by the different theologies in this very small world and want to learn as much as possible.

I haven&#39;t been to all Pentecostal churches,<br/>\n  but let me tell you, the one I was raised in made me never set foot in<br/>\n  another one.  It was all about &quot;obedience&quot; and spanking, and parents<br/>\n  would lament that it&#39;s no longer legal to stone disobedient children as<br/>\n  it was in Biblical days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When my husband and I were married, we lived in Newark (Hanover,<br/>\n  actually, which is about two square miles).  There was an Apostolic<br/>\n  church within a block of our home, and we started going there to meet<br/>\n  people.  The women at the church homeschooled and I was excited because<br/>\n  even though I didn&#39;t have kids, I knew I&#39;d homeschool them when I did.<br/>\n  Well, these women were downright scary.  They had the most<br/>\n  poorly-behaved children I have ever met in my life, and they responded<br/>\n  to every misbehavior by screaming, &quot;I&#39;m going to spank you if you don&#39;t<br/>\n  stop what you&#39;re doing right now!&quot;  In twenty minutes, this would be<br/>\n  shouted out probably fifty times, and then kids would be grabbed by the<br/>\n  arm and spanked right there in front of everyone, and they&#39;d immediately<br/>\n  start misbehaving again.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We spent two years living in Steubenville, and most of the homeschoolers<br/>\n  there are Catholic.  Now, most of the Catholics I&#39;ve known in my life<br/>\n  have been very relaxed about religion.  But the Franciscan University of<br/>\n  Steubenville attracts the most uptight Catholics from around the country<br/>\n  and concentrates them in one town.  Almost all of the women whose<br/>\n  husbands attend the Franciscan University homeschool.  It would really<br/>\n  be funny to see the way they epitomize all the stereotypes of<br/>\n  &quot;homeschoolers&quot;, except it isn&#39;t funny because it&#39;s real.  And my mom is<br/>\n  a librarian in that town and she&#39;s against homeschooling because of it.<br/>\n  She knows I&#39;m not even Christian, let alone fundamentalist, but she<br/>\n  can&#39;t think about homeschooling without thinking about these women<br/>\n  coming into the library with their poorly-adjusted children, and she&#39;s<br/>\n  convinced my kids will be &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think something like seventy percent of Americans are Christian.  And<br/>\n  I know darn well seventy percent of Americans are not anything like the<br/>\n  fundamentalists I&#39;ve met in my lifetime.  Most Christians don&#39;t want to<br/>\n  be associated with the &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot;, apparently yourself included.<br/>\n  Just like most Muslims don&#39;t want to be associated with the<br/>\n  fundamentalists in their religion either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  You say, &gt;&gt;&gt;Making fun of extreme religious people&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s a huge difference between extremely spiritual people and<br/>\n  extremely religious people.  Spiritual people are some of the calmest,<br/>\n  most inspiring people in the world.  Mother Theresa was an extremely<br/>\n  spiritual Catholic, and I don&#39;t know anyone of any religion who thought<br/>\n  she was a freak.  Extremely religious people, on the other hand, are<br/>\n  often shrill, paranoid, and dangerous.  Spiritual Christians believe<br/>\n  that God is Love and they believe the best thing they can do is be a<br/>\n  model of that love.  Religious Christians believe that every word of the<br/>\n  Bible is infallible and they seek out people who aren&#39;t as &quot;holy&quot; as<br/>\n  they are, and persecute them.  Spirituality is about one&#39;s relationship<br/>\n  with the Infinite.  Religion is about being &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Even Jesus spoke out against the fundamentalists in his religion in his<br/>\n  time.  He called them vipers and hypocrites. <br/>\n<br/>\n  You say, &gt;&gt;&gt; prejudiced against Christians&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;folks who are supposed to<br/>\n  be so <br/>\n  open-minded&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;so careless with generalizations&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I see is not people who know nothing about Christians being<br/>\n  prejudiced against the religion.  What I see is that the people who are<br/>\n  most outspoken against Christianity are people who were raised in<br/>\n  fundamentalist homes and have a lot of negative experience with<br/>\n  fundamentalist Christians.  One of the reasons televangelists are so<br/>\n  much more intolerant of Pagans and Wiccans than any other religion is<br/>\n  because most people are born into a religion, while the vast majority of<br/>\n  Pagans and Wiccans were raised Christian and left the religion<br/>\n  (ironically, because of people like the televangelists).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  If being a Christian means that you love Jesus, wonderful.  People who<br/>\n  truly love their God are beautiful people, whether their God is Jesus,<br/>\n  Allah, Krishna, Inanna, Isis, Freya.  If being a Christian means that<br/>\n  you spank your kids and require obedience and submit to your husband and<br/>\n  think everyone is going to hell unless they&#39;re a member of your church,<br/>\n  which is the Only One Right and True interpretation of the Only One True<br/>\n  God, then I can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s not an ugly thing.  Fundamentalism is<br/>\n  ugly whether it&#39;s Christians, or the Muslims who feel Allah wants them<br/>\n  to kill all &quot;infidels&quot; or the Pagan Aztecs who practiced human<br/>\n  sacrifice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Gandhi was killed by a Hindu fundamentalist who opposed his idea of<br/>\n  tolerance between the Muslims and Hindus in India.  Gandhi was an<br/>\n  example of a spiritual person.  The person who killed him is an example<br/>\n  of a religious people.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I feel very strongly about this issue too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I haven&#39;t been to all Pentecostal churches,<br/>\nbut let me tell you, the one I was raised in made me never set foot in<br/>\nanother one.  It was all about &quot;obedience&quot; and spanking, and parents<br/>\nwould lament that it&#39;s no longer legal to stone disobedient children as<br/>\nit was in Biblical days.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen my husband and I were married, we lived in Newark (Hanover,<br/>\nactually, which is about two square miles).  There was an Apostolic<br/>\nchurch within a block of our home, and we started going there to meet<br/>\npeople.  The women at the church homeschooled and I was excited because<br/>\neven though I didn&#39;t have kids, I knew I&#39;d homeschool them when I did.<br/>\nWell, these women were downright scary.  They had the most<br/>\npoorly-behaved children I have ever met in my life, and they responded<br/>\nto every misbehavior by screaming, &quot;I&#39;m going to spank you if you don&#39;t<br/>\nstop what you&#39;re doing right now!&quot;  In twenty minutes, this would be<br/>\nshouted out probably fifty times, and then kids would be grabbed by the<br/>\narm and spanked right there in front of everyone, and they&#39;d immediately<br/>\nstart misbehaving again.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe spent two years living in Steubenville, and most of the homeschoolers<br/>\nthere are Catholic.  Now, most of the Catholics I&#39;ve known in my life<br/>\nhave been very relaxed about religion.  But the Franciscan University of<br/>\nSteubenville attracts the most uptight Catholics from around the country<br/>\nand concentrates them in one town.  Almost all of the women whose<br/>\nhusbands attend the Franciscan University homeschool.  It would really<br/>\nbe funny to see the way they epitomize all the stereotypes of<br/>\n&quot;homeschoolers&quot;, except it isn&#39;t funny because it&#39;s real.  And my mom is<br/>\na librarian in that town and she&#39;s against homeschooling because of it.<br/>\nShe knows I&#39;m not even Christian, let alone fundamentalist, but she<br/>\ncan&#39;t think about homeschooling without thinking about these women<br/>\ncoming into the library with their poorly-adjusted children, and she&#39;s<br/>\nconvinced my kids will be &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think something like seventy percent of Americans are Christian.  And<br/>\nI know darn well seventy percent of Americans are not anything like the<br/>\nfundamentalists I&#39;ve met in my lifetime.  Most Christians don&#39;t want to<br/>\nbe associated with the &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot;, apparently yourself included.<br/>\nJust like most Muslims don&#39;t want to be associated with the<br/>\nfundamentalists in their religion either.  <br/>\n <br/>\nYou say, &gt;&gt;&gt;Making fun of extreme religious people&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge difference between extremely spiritual people and<br/>\nextremely religious people.  Spiritual people are some of the calmest,<br/>\nmost inspiring people in the world.  Mother Theresa was an extremely<br/>\nspiritual Catholic, and I don&#39;t know anyone of any religion who thought<br/>\nshe was a freak.  Extremely religious people, on the other hand, are<br/>\noften shrill, paranoid, and dangerous.  Spiritual Christians believe<br/>\nthat God is Love and they believe the best thing they can do is be a<br/>\nmodel of that love.  Religious Christians believe that every word of the<br/>\nBible is infallible and they seek out people who aren&#39;t as &quot;holy&quot; as<br/>\nthey are, and persecute them.  Spirituality is about one&#39;s relationship<br/>\nwith the Infinite.  Religion is about being &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEven Jesus spoke out against the fundamentalists in his religion in his<br/>\ntime.  He called them vipers and hypocrites. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, &gt;&gt;&gt; prejudiced against Christians&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;folks who are supposed to<br/>\nbe so <br/>\nopen-minded&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;so careless with generalizations&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I see is not people who know nothing about Christians being<br/>\nprejudiced against the religion.  What I see is that the people who are<br/>\nmost outspoken against Christianity are people who were raised in<br/>\nfundamentalist homes and have a lot of negative experience with<br/>\nfundamentalist Christians.  One of the reasons televangelists are so<br/>\nmuch more intolerant of Pagans and Wiccans than any other religion is<br/>\nbecause most people are born into a religion, while the vast majority of<br/>\nPagans and Wiccans were raised Christian and left the religion<br/>\n(ironically, because of people like the televangelists).  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf being a Christian means that you love Jesus, wonderful.  People who<br/>\ntruly love their God are beautiful people, whether their God is Jesus,<br/>\nAllah, Krishna, Inanna, Isis, Freya.  If being a Christian means that<br/>\nyou spank your kids and require obedience and submit to your husband and<br/>\nthink everyone is going to hell unless they&#39;re a member of your church,<br/>\nwhich is the Only One Right and True interpretation of the Only One True<br/>\nGod, then I can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s not an ugly thing.  Fundamentalism is<br/>\nugly whether it&#39;s Christians, or the Muslims who feel Allah wants them<br/>\nto kill all &quot;infidels&quot; or the Pagan Aztecs who practiced human<br/>\nsacrifice.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGandhi was killed by a Hindu fundamentalist who opposed his idea of<br/>\ntolerance between the Muslims and Hindus in India.  Gandhi was an<br/>\nexample of a spiritual person.  The person who killed him is an example<br/>\nof a religious people.<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel very strongly about this issue too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSorcha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Christians again","postDate":"1049951028","msgId":63846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNi4yNmUwM2VkYi4yYmM2NTUzNEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63844,"nextInTopic":63859,"prevInTime":63845,"nextInTime":63847,"topicId":63844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/9/03 10:25:20 PM, unolist@aol.com writes:  If I were homeschooling because of being fundamentalist Christians those ...
