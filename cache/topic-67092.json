I was shocked, because I thought it was such an &quot;unknown&quot; book <br/>\nand author.   Of coure, the movie, Forrest Gump, was also great.

My father gave me the book because <br/>\nBill Goldman had given it to him. They had become friends when Bill Goldman <br/>\nwrote a book about Broadway called The Season, which looked at a particular <br/>\nseason on Broadway and all the plays that had opened.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad had a play that opened called Something Different. And Bill Goldman <br/>\ndevoted a chapter in his book to that play. And they became friends. And he <br/>\ngave this to my dad, back I think when it first came out in the early &#39;70s, <br/>\nand said, what do you think about making a movie out of this? And my dad <br/>\nsaid, well, he wasn&#39;t really a, you know, he didn&#39;t really, hadn&#39;t read it. <br/>\nBut he gave me the book and said, you know, do you want to read it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI read it and at the time it was the favorite book of my life that I&#39;d ever <br/>\nread at that point and probably to this point. And so then, years later, when <br/>\nI was thinking about making movies, I went back and reread it, and it again <br/>\nspoke like to me. It was like as if Bill, Bill Goldman had been in my head, <br/>\nand had written something that was inside my head. So I went to him and met <br/>\nwith him and he said, this is, this is the favorite book I&#39;ve ever written in <br/>\nmy life. I want it on my tombstone. Uh, what are you gonna do with it? And I <br/>\nwas shaking in my boots thinking, you know, he was gonna, you know, really <br/>\ncriticize it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s Robin Wright, by the way, the most beautiful, you know, [laughs] <br/>\nshe&#39;s incredibly beautiful and we had to find the most beautiful girl in all <br/>\nthe land and I think we found it with her, who can, not only was beautiful, <br/>\nbut acted and did a wonderful British accent and was the perfect embodiment <br/>\nof The Princess Bride.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, Bill Goldman was totally, you know, challenging me as to whether <br/>\nor not I could pull this off. And when I told him that I basically wanted to <br/>\nhonor his book and be as faithful as possible, he agreed to let me do it. At <br/>\nthat time, I had only made Spinal Tap. That was the only picture I had made <br/>\nand I actually had finished The Sure Thing, but it hadn&#39;t come out yet. And <br/>\nhe saw those two pictures and then he agreed to let me, to let me do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got a chance to work with my favorite writer and he entrusted his, his <br/>\nfavorite book to me. And I was very grateful that he did that.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] movie adaptations","postDate":"1051797883","msgId":67127,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWIwMWMzMGZlYSQ5ZGMxZTYwMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDYuZmU3OWE3ZC4yYmUyMWRlM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67120,"nextInTopic":67155,"prevInTime":67126,"nextInTime":67128,"topicId":67092,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I heard that Colour Purple has a tragic/sad ending that Speilburg ruined by going Hollywood-happy.
