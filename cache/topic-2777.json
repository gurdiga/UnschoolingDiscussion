After work/school this morning, the <br/>\nkids and I headed outside. We had to stop at a printing shop and then to drop <br/>\noff work at my client&#39;s house.

Amy practiced <br/>\nwalking around the perimeter of the playground, sparking a discussion of <br/>\nshapes, corners, and balance.  She also discovered wild mushrooms growing, <br/>\nwhich we need to identify.  I collected various leaves and we did some <br/>\nmatching games:  i.e. Find another leaf that looks like this one.  We <br/>\nobserved how the trees grow, some all in one piece and others splitting into <br/>\nwhat looks like 2 or even 4 trunks.  We observed the percentage of split <br/>\ntrees to single trees; and compared amounts of oaks vs. others (I still have <br/>\nto identify the others).

(i need to start one of those little notebooks).  We&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen doing the nature thing lately too.  We have five acres and this <br/>\nis really the first time we had a chance to explore the outer <br/>\nboundaries from a little different perspective.  Sterling found a <br/>\npheasant feather and magpie feather, we saw several wildflowers in <br/>\nbloom, collected a few pine cones, and saw a spider web in the grass <br/>\nwith a perfect funnel web.  he even had to bring his Dad back to the <br/>\nspot to show him when he got home from work.  course all these things <br/>\nprompted other related activities in learning more about what we <br/>\nfound and saw.  About a half mile from us, there are cattails growing <br/>\nin the ditch by the road.  Today we went and cut some of them to <br/>\nbring home.  then we had to find out if they dry better upside-down <br/>\nor straight up.  you&#39;re adventure with the leaves reminded me of how <br/>\ni miss the foliage out here but also gave me the idea to email my <br/>\nsister in NH to collect some colorful leaves for us before it is too <br/>\nlate.
