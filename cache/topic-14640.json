And I would like <br/>\nto offer something which may be very unpopular here (as it was on a <br/>\ncouple of other lists): actually it&#39;s two sources I want to mention - <br/>\none is Aletha Solter and her books &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; and &quot;Tears and <br/>\nTantrums&quot;, the other is Martha Welch and her book &quot;Holding Time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not interested in starting a major debate about the &quot;dangers of <br/>\nholing therapy&quot; and on and on and on..... been there already.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just think that you might want to check these books out, Amy, and <br/>\ndecide for yourself if this might work for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAletha Solter says that even young babies experience stress, toddlers <br/>\neven more so. I don&#39;t think we can argue that point. She goes on to <br/>\nsay, however, and this is where some people cringe, that <br/>\nbabies/toddlers/children need to be allowed to cry and rage to <br/>\nrelease these stresses from their bodies. She says that babies who <br/>\nhave not released stress may use nursing as a &quot;control pattern&quot; to <br/>\nsuppress their upset feelings and that it can lead to further control <br/>\npattern later in life, in other words: addictive behaviours like <br/>\nsmoking, drinking, over eating, watching too much TV, being on the <br/>\ncomputer too much :-) etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this is just a suggestion for those open to something <br/>\ndifferent. It is NOT an invitation to start a heated discussion about <br/>\nthe subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry, to be sounding like this, but it has happened before and <br/>\nI&#39;ver heard it all before (the negative stuff about holding, I mean).<br/>\n<br/>\nMartha Welch&#39;s approach is more intense than that of Aletha Solter, <br/>\nbut still fascinating to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir web sites are:<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.awareparenting,com and www.marthawelch.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Nicoletta<br/>\n**************************<br/>\n&quot;It is paradoxical, yet true: children are the most in need<br/>\nof loving attention when they act the least deserving of it!&quot; <br/>\nby Aletha Solter, 1998, from the article: &quot;Why children misbehave&quot;<br/>\nwww.awareparenting.com<br/>\n**************************</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14562,"nextTopicId":14677}}
