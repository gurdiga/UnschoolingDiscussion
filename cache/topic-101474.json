The thing that gave me the biggest boost in confidence was going to the Live and Learn Conference.  It&#39;s in a different city every year, but the time I went it was in Columbia, SC, and I got me and the kids there even though I was very nervous about traveling without hubby along.  There were so many other people and speakers who really understood how I wanted to raise my kids--not fix them, not make them stuff their brains with boring text book info, just be here and do what they feel they need to grow and be in this world.  I finally gave myself permission to stop worrying about what I should approve of and disapprove of!  Instead, I started talking to my kids about what they were interested in, and I was fascinated by them!  And I found out that while they are &quot;playing&quot; they are actually developing the very skills that &quot;professional educators&quot; would love to see in schooled kids.  Things like being able to read some directions and follow them, do research to find the answer to a problem, that sort of stuff.  The difference is that my kids were doing it over their Yu-Gi-Oh game or video games.  Now my kids are playing Runescape, (www.runescape.com) and I am enjoying talking to them about it, or watching some as they play, if they want.  <br/>\n     I&#39;m rambling, so let me just add one other thing.  I have found that when I start to get nervous about wether or not my kids will hever have a certain skill or attitude, I immediately start focusing on developing it in *myself*.  I am convinced that my kids learn more by watching me and my husband than any thing else, but I also think it&#39;s a great way to refocus my attention and sorta &quot;row my own boat,&quot; instead of feeling like I need to be teaching.  <br/>\nDeirdre in Alabama</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127985589,"authorName":"Amber Marshall","from":"&quot;Amber Marshall&quot; &lt;amgaveli@...&gt;","profile":"amgaveli","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Amber, was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: New here and considering unschooling","postDate":"1102144023","msgId":101489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNvcm5tbitiaXVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjA0MDU1NzU1LjYyMzUucW1haWxAd2ViNDA0MjcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":101487,"nextInTopic":101490,"prevInTime":101488,"nextInTime":101490,"topicId":101474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Dana~ We live in Everett, I beleive that about 1hour or so south of Bellingham.A dear friend of mine is actually just finishing her degree at the University","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-229226119\">Hi Dana~<br/>\n We live in Everett, I beleive that about 1hour or so south of<br/>\nBellingham.A dear friend of mine is actually just finishing her degree<br/>\nat the University up there.<br/>\n~Amber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dana Matt<br/>\n&lt;hoffmanwilson@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ~Amber in WA<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amber in Washington, where in Washington are you?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dana<br/>\n&gt; in Bellingham<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? <br/>\n&gt; The all-new My Yahoo! - Get yours free! <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://my.yahoo.com\">http://my.yahoo.com</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Amber, was Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: New here and considering unschooling","postDate":"1102139875","msgId":101487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjA0MDU1NzU1LjYyMzUucW1haWxAd2ViNDA0MjcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGNvcWdqOCtzcTIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101483,"nextInTopic":101489,"prevInTime":101486,"nextInTime":101488,"topicId":101474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
