If the <br/>\nfemale chooses to keep the baby then it shouldn&#39;t be an <br/>\nimpediment to anything else she wants to do with her life.

I <br/>\nhelped out at a youth advisory centre in the UK before I came here <br/>\nand teenagers were still convinced you couldn&#39;t &#39;get pregnant&#39; the <br/>\nfirst time. Or if you didn&#39;t love the boy.<br/>\nIt was heart-breaking dealing with a pregnant 13 yo whose parents <br/>\ndisowned her because she was pregnant, knowing that the state <br/>\nwould judge her unfit when she gave birth and would probably take <br/>\nher baby away.<br/>\nProper sex education may have helped, also empowering girls so <br/>\nthat they can either feel strong enough to say no, not going along <br/>\nwith their mates, and strong enough to use contraception. British <br/>\nsex education in schools often doesn&#39;t happen till 15 and lasts <br/>\nabout half an hour. When I was in school we got shown a video of a <br/>\nbaby being born. That was it. No mention of where the baby came <br/>\nfrom. Of course, we all knew, as we gained our education from <br/>\ndiscussions with other 15 year olds....<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.
