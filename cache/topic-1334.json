I just love the whole osteopathic medicine approach.  Very holistic<br/>\nand oriented at approaching the entire patient as a person with<br/>\npsychological/emotional needs to consider and other medical conditions that<br/>\nmight affect seemingly unrelated things in their health.  As opposed to the<br/>\ntraditional medicine method of treating symptoms, which may not be what is<br/>\nneeded to take care of the underlying cause.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.... my sister is an osteopathic pathologist and gp, and coincidentally<br/>\nour family doctor before we moved was an osteopath who went to school with<br/>\nher.  We were not able to find an osteopath in our new area.  With two<br/>\nlittle ones, one with a LOT of allergies, I have to run to the doctor<br/>\noften.  Our doctor is competent and has a good manner, and I was satisfied<br/>\nwith his help when I was delivering our second baby.  But he is what I<br/>\nwould call a prescription doctor and always whips out that pad, every time<br/>\nwe go to him.  I use my judgement and do not always get them filled, but I<br/>\nwish he was more eager to prescribe diet changes, physical therapy, natural<br/>\napproaches before we resort to drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am rambling...  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1323,"nextTopicId":1322}}
