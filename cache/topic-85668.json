While<br/>\nI&#39;m less intrigued with arterial spray for art&#39;s sake I&#39;m still<br/>\nfascinated by disgusting things in real life.  I stop to view dead birds<br/>\nand such when I find them.   I like to think I&#39;m building a model of<br/>\ndeath in my own mind for later reference.  Much later, hopefully.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ok that it bothers you and it&#39;s ok that it&#39;s not bothering your<br/>\nkids.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people have felt television and video game violence would<br/>\ndesensitize kids to actual violence.  I think we are and need to be<br/>\ndesensitized to general violence or we&#39;d never survive with our minds<br/>\nintact.  I think it&#39;s instinctual self preservation to not be overly<br/>\nalarmed by natural disasters in China (assuming we don&#39;t live in China)<br/>\nor shooting sprees in Miami (long as it&#39;s not our neighborhood.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think being desensitized to images of dead bodies on the news is<br/>\nnormal.  What are we going to do about that poor expired person now<br/>\nanyway?  How long do we grieve over a lost person we don&#39;t know when our<br/>\nlives are filled with living people who need us?  I think we&#39;d react with<br/>\nthe ordinary and appropriate amount of horror, sympathy and dread if we<br/>\nfound one on our front lawn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKids *are* far removed from violence and death.  They should be.  They<br/>\nshould not be in fear of it.  It should seem like impossible fantasy<br/>\nstuff to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of parents hope their kids will be sensitive, caring people<br/>\nand are afraid this enjoyment of violent video games or movies is a sign<br/>\nthey won&#39;t be.  It&#39;s not so much fear they&#39;ll be harmed by the images of<br/>\nviolence as concern liking it in the first place means something sinister<br/>\nin their characters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Dylan was around eight when he started playing games with<br/>\nshooting and such.  By then he&#39;d seen bugs mashed on windshields and dead<br/>\nbirds in the yard and crunched critters by the side of the road. <br/>\nWe took care of my dad at home when he was dying of cancer, and Dylan sat<br/>\nby his bed and read to him. <br/>\nBy eight he&#39;d already been exposed to a lot of death.  The stuff on video<br/>\ngames wasn&#39;t real and he knew it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s so good at shooting games he could go to public school, but he&#39;s<br/>\nkind and ethical and doesn&#39;t even swat mosquito&#39;s.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is changing the subject some, but if I can&#39;t ease your mind about<br/>\nloss of innocence maybe this will comfort you on some other level.   <br/>\n<br/>\nVideo-Game Killing Builds Visual Skills, Researchers Report<br/>\nBy SANDRA BLAKESLEE<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, the news that every parent dreads. Researchers are reporting<br/>\ntoday that first-person-shooter video games  the kind that require<br/>\nplayers to kill or maim enemies or monsters that pop out of nowhere <br/>\nsharply improve visual attention skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nExperienced players of these games are 30 percent to 50 percent better<br/>\nthan nonplayers at taking in everything that happens around them,<br/>\naccording to the research, which appears today in the journal Nature.<br/>\nThey identify objects in their peripheral vision, perceiving numerous<br/>\nobjects without having to count them, switch attention rapidly and track<br/>\nmany items at once. <br/>\n<br/>\nNor are players simply faster at these tasks, said Dr. Daphne Bavelier,<br/>\nan associate professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of<br/>\nRochester, who led the study. First-person action games increase the<br/>\nbrain&#39;s capacity to spread attention over a wide range of events. Other<br/>\ntypes of action games, including those that focus on strategy or role<br/>\nplaying, do not produce the same effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile some researchers have suggested possible links between video games<br/>\nand other abilities, this study is thought to be the first to explore<br/>\ntheir effects on visual skills. Though the number of subjects was small,<br/>\nDr. Bavelier said, the effects were too large to be a result of chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We were really surprised,&quot; Dr. Bavelier said, adding that as little as<br/>\n10 hours of play substantially increased visual skills among novice<br/>\nplayers. &quot;You get better at a lot of things, not just the game,&quot; she<br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Dr. Bavelier emphasized that the improved visual attention skills did<br/>\nnot translate to reading, writing and mathematics. Nor is it clear that<br/>\nthey lead to higher I.Q. scores, although visual attention and reaction<br/>\ntime are important components of many standardized tests. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Please, keep doing your homework,&quot; said Dr. Bavelier, the mother of<br/>\n6-year-old twins and a 2-year-old. <br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Jeremy Wolfe, the director of the Visual Attention Laboratory at<br/>\nHarvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study, said he was<br/>\nintrigued at the idea that &quot;socially dubious games might improve<br/>\nsomething like general intelligence.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It might give every 14-year-old something to tell his parents,&quot; Dr.<br/>\nWolfe said. &quot; `Hey, don&#39;t make me study. Give me another grenade.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, he noted that an increased capacity for visual attention was<br/>\nhelpful in tasks as diverse as flying, driving, radiology and airport<br/>\nscreening.<br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Bavelier is an expert on how experience changes the brain,<br/>\nparticularly the effects of congenital deafness on visual skills and<br/>\nattention. A few years ago, a Rochester student, Shawn Green, asked to<br/>\nwork on a senior project in her laboratory. They agreed that he would<br/>\nhelp design visual attention tasks for the deaf.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when Mr. Green tried out the tests, he found they were ridiculously<br/>\neasy, Dr. Bavelier said. So did his friends, who were all devoted to<br/>\nvideo games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe professor and her student decided to study the connection between<br/>\nvideo game playing and visual attention. They carried out four<br/>\nexperiments on undergraduates, all of them male because no female shooter<br/>\ngame fans could be found on campus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first tested the ability to localize targets in a cluttered<br/>\nenvironment and spread visual attention over a wide area  a skill that<br/>\nmany elderly drivers lose. Gamers performed at least 50 percent better<br/>\nthan nongamers, Dr. Bavelier said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second involved the ability to say, instantly, how many objects were<br/>\nflashed on a screen. Most people can do this with up to four objects, Dr.<br/>\nBavelier said. Above that, they start counting. Gamers could identify up<br/>\nto 10 items on a screen without counting. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other two experiments tested the players&#39; ability to process<br/>\nfast-occurring visual information and to switch attention. Again, players<br/>\nwere far superior to nonplayers. <br/>\n<br/>\nA fifth experiment trained nonplayers, including some women, for 10<br/>\nconsecutive days on one of two video games  either Medal of Honor:<br/>\nAllied Assault, a first-person-shooter game that simulates World War II<br/>\ncombat situations, or the slower-moving puzzle game Tetris. Only the<br/>\nshooter game improved visual attention, Dr. Bavelier said, and it did so<br/>\nin both sexes. Among novices, the effects waned within a couple of<br/>\nmonths, but superior visual attention skills seemed firmly rooted in game<br/>\naddicts. <br/>\n<br/>\nDr. Bavelier said the next step would be to tease the games apart to find<br/>\nout what aspects promoted brain changes. Are violence and danger<br/>\nnecessary? Does this sort of brain plasticity change with age? Will it<br/>\naffect certain measures of intelligence? <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, she said, the military is already exploiting action games to<br/>\ntrain special forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To enter territory you&#39;ve never seen and detect where your enemies are,&quot;<br/>\nshe went on, &quot;you need an accurate understanding of the visual scene.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85719,"nextTopicId":85687}}
