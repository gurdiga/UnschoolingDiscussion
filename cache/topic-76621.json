When I was walking up the hill <br/>\nhe was coming down and he burst into tears. I began to cry also asking him <br/>\nwhat was wrong... He said that I had missed his Kayak race. I apologized and told <br/>\nhim I knew nothing about it. I wasn&#39;t late either.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make a long story short he loved the camp and asked to go for two weeks <br/>\nnext time. He misses his counselors but not a few campers. He said he bragged <br/>\ntoo much and everyone hated him. One boy called him a faggit and gay.  He told <br/>\nthem that that was not very nice so the boy said he was a f****ing A** hole. <br/>\nThen the boy asked if he wanted to make something of it.  Dustin said yes and <br/>\nthe boy pounced him in the face. Dustin who has never fought a day in his life <br/>\nexcept for two years of wrestling and just finished reading the SAS handbook <br/>\nknocked the boy on his but. I asked him his counselor said anything he said no <br/>\ncuz I didn&#39;t start it and the boy was knocked down. <br/>\nHe got his first kiss! He said you know Mom I kinda liked it. I said well it <br/>\nis nice to be liked isn&#39;t it : ) But I was a bit annoyed that it had happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo besides the boys he loved camp. Since last night he has asked for a kayak, <br/>\nhe wants to go climbing, he wants a 30-06 and wants to go to Canada and hunt <br/>\nCaribou and Moose. I suggested to my husband maybe he and Dustin should go <br/>\nhunting for a week up north. He still has not been able to take his two weeks <br/>\nvacation so maybe they will do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry so long....<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Camp","postDate":"1058530320","msgId":76694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMuMTU1NTFiNTcuMmM0OTNlMTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76692,"nextInTopic":76746,"prevInTime":76693,"nextInTime":76695,"topicId":76621,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL, When I posted yesterday I figured someone would have known about the camps.

He and I are always together. <br/>\nMy mom said the other day well &quot;Brian should be happy that he got rid of him <br/>\nfor a week.&quot; She who shipped us off to camp several times and we refused to <br/>\nparticipate and got to go home the same or following day.<br/>\nI was like no Mom we both miss him very much.  My Father In Law asked if the <br/>\nhouse was quieter, I said no not all. We all miss him! The 3 yr. keeps asking <br/>\nif we can go get him now.  I wanted to so badly but Dustin knows if he was not <br/>\nhaving fun or something was wrong he would make sure he got to call me to <br/>\ncome get him. One time he was at a birthday party and some kids while playing in <br/>\nthe woods where throwing rocks at him trying to get him lost. He ended up <br/>\nbeginning to walk home until the mother picked him up on the side of the road and <br/>\nbrought him home. The boys followed him and chucked rocks at him as he walked. <br/>\nThe boys Mom was totally mad at him for leaving and we are no longer friendly <br/>\nwith the family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have laid in bed most of this week wondering if he would do the same or if <br/>\nhe would call me. I know he would call as it took us two hours to get there he <br/>\nknows how far from home he is. The paperwork said no phone calls. His Nana <br/>\nlives about 20 minutes away from the camp he asked how close she was and I said <br/>\nmuch too far to walk please don&#39;t try it. If there is a problem that I wanted <br/>\nhim to call me and I would come get him. When I dropped him off he something <br/>\nlike it&#39;s ok Mom I&#39;ll be fine. So I don&#39;t want to ruin it for him for my own <br/>\nreasons if he is having fun. I pick him up tomorrow am at 11 so we shall see. <br/>\nWhen I dropped him off about half of the kids had been repeat campers, maybe <br/>\nforced or willing I don&#39;t know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know its all me. I miss my baby but I have to say this trip may open up <br/>\nother areas for him. He has been wanting to go tenting. He loves to do archery <br/>\nand shoot his gun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am really trying not to make this about my worries. Kinda bugs me they say <br/>\nno calls. They can answer my questions cant they? I bet there is no answer if <br/>\nI do call.

They went with <br/>\nmy girlfriend and her kids straight from our parkday to the local <br/>\namusement/waterpark because it was free homeschoolers day. They were so excited they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t even kiss me goodbye!!! I couldn&#39;t believe it. They never so much as walk <br/>\naway without a kiss goodbye. They finally called me after they were done at the <br/>\npark, but I have a feeling that was because while they were still sliding <br/>\nhumongous water rides, I called my friend to whine about not getting any <br/>\nkisses!!! LOL She too was shocked. As soon as the girls called, they said, &quot;Oh mommy <br/>\nwe are so sorry, we remembered you after we got in the car and rode away, but <br/>\nwe forgot you again when we got to the park!&quot; If it wasn&#39;t so funny, it may <br/>\nhave hurt my feelings. But they had a blast. I got them back when we met up at <br/>\nour Karate studio at 11:30 this morning. But it felt like they were gone a lot <br/>\nlonger than 18 hours.
