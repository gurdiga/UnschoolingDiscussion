He also has been involved with the video game for about 3 years now.   At first I resisted this and hated it, thinking that this could not be good.  My hubby has two other children that are older and so Gus was influenced by this.  It&#39;s also a time for bonding for Jerry and Gus.  What helped me to feel better about it is; Gus learned so much more doing and learning how to do the game.  Jerry and Gus looked up the history of the game, characters, and learned about special skills the characters needed.  It has a great learning experience for me too.  Unschooling does not have to look like I think it should all the time.<br/>\nWe also have a time factor too.  Gus would play it all day if we let him.  He is allowed to play every other day and weekends.  This works great for time to connect for dad and son.  I hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.
