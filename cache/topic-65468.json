If they <br/>\nwere never exposed to the concept of there being one right way to pay <br/>\nattention or gather information. Maybe their brains would grow and <br/>\nadapt to itself so that they wouldn&#39;t feel frustrated with their <br/>\ninability to pay attention. They would have just learned a completely <br/>\ndifferent (from the norm) way of getting and retaining the info they <br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve seen some of this in my own kids. Just throwing an idea <br/>\nout there for discussion.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an interesting idea!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that just as there are various &quot;learning styles&quot;, there are also various &quot;thinking styles&quot; that lay on a continuum from &quot;left-brained&quot;/convergent/part-to-whole thinking to &quot;right-brained&quot;/divergent/whole-to-part thinking. And although children/adults are able to move along the spectrum depending on the &quot;task&quot;, there are some for which one style of thinking is clearly dominant, just as although children can use various learning styles depending on the environment, they are likely to have one or two dominant, or preferable, learning styles.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost schools and school-at-home curriculums certainly prize left-brained/sequential thinking and try hard to &quot;train&quot; all kids to think in that style; in fact, they are penalized if they don&#39;t. Think &quot;show your work&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t ask that now, I&#39;ll get to it later&quot; etc. Even when they try to adapt to different learning styles, say visual or kinesthetic, they still present the material in a sequential fashion which a whole-to-part thinker often finds very frustrating. They want the big picture, then time to contemplate the different parts and the patterns that arise.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I prize most about unschooling is that the divergent thinker is not penalized, not made to feel unsuccessful or frustrated just because they don&#39;t think the way the &quot;teacher&quot; wants them to.  He/she can take the time to understand how they best learn and think, and then have the time to naturally gravitate to jobs/careers that support and prize these styles, not spend their time being frustrated as they try to fit into the convergent thinking world of school and &quot;typical jobs&quot;.  There are lots of jobs out there where skills such as being able to &quot;think outside the box&quot;, &quot;see the big picture&quot;, &quot;jump quickly between tasks&quot;, &quot;process lots of different input quickly&quot; etc. are prized, and being able to spend the day at your desk replying to email and filling out paperwork (at whatever corporate level) are not necessary requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo having said that, does anyone have any great ideas for supporting a divergent thinker? I find that even homeschooling field trips and workshops are very convergent/sequential in nature and as such we do not enjoy them, especially my son Joseph (11). We&#39;ll hit the places on our own so the kids can go at their own pace and style. And stuff we have at home he uses in his own style, forget the step-by-step instructions, just see the end product and get there. Maybe there are some shows, magazines, or products/activities out there that are a natural fit for a divergent thinker?<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5047879,"authorName":"Susan Fuerst","from":"&quot;Susan Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;","profile":"jsf491","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Thinking styles","postDate":"1050778529","msgId":65490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzMDZhNSQ0Mjg0NjgxMCQ2NDAwYThjMEB5b3Vyam9ua3c2OHRseT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMzMDY5NyRlY2FhZjEwMCRiN2ViMTg0MUB5b3VyNmtyNHp4bGQ5MD4="},"prevInTopic":65482,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":65489,"nextInTime":65491,"topicId":65468,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 8 yo dd must be this synthetic type....she so often comes up with responses that seem to be out of some far off space that I am not privy to.
