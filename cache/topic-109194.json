I&#39;ll quote it from an e-mail I wrote yesterday:<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty quit his job.  He told Mike on Thursday that he wanted to finish the <br/>\nwork that was there and then quit.  He said Mike did his &quot;depressed thing,&quot; but <br/>\notherwise was fine with it.  Earlier in the week Marty had talked to me about <br/>\nwhat two weeks&#39; notice meant and how it would work with a four day a week job, <br/>\nand I told him the tradition, but this isn&#39;t that formal a job.  He talked <br/>\nabout how he might quit, and said he might tell Mike he&#39;d saty until Mike found <br/>\nsomeone else.  I said don&#39;t do that!  He might never even look.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI also cautioned Marty not to say it was about money or hours, or Mike might <br/>\noffer him more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he said he&#39;d finish current orders, and Mike said that might be enough <br/>\nwork to last until middle of next week, but Marty finished it Thursday and <br/>\nFriday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to have a week off before looking for something else.  We&#39;re *right* <br/>\nby Raley&#39;s, Lowe&#39;s and a Twister&#39;s.  Toward Menaul there&#39;s a video game store <br/>\nthat really wanted to hire Kirby after he quit at Active Imagination, but <br/>\nKirby turned them down twice.  I&#39;m pressing Marty to go there and get a job so he <br/>\ncan get an employee discount on the new Playstation that&#39;s coming out.  I <br/>\nsaid &quot;DO IT!  Do it right now!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t seem eager.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;You kids never do what I tell you to do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty:  &quot;That&#39;s how we were raised.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Well it&#39;s going to bite you in the butt someday.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty-without-a-pause:  &quot;That we were raised that way?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOooohh...   He won. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was nothing wrong with the job, it&#39;s just that when Marty started there <br/>\nwere other people to talk to and he was learning lots of new things, but it <br/>\ndevolved into Marty working all alone and doing things he had done before.<br/>\n=============================<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty&#39;s quick. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAnd I can&#39;t &quot;make&quot; him do anything.   I can offer suggestions, but he rightly <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel he has no options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109086,"nextTopicId":109203}}
