His phone rings and he gets a photo of a dog having his mouth brushed with the toothbrush the guy now has in his mouth.  Next you see a group of guys and one starts to eat some dip.  Now this second guy&#39;s phone rings.  He gets a photo of the first guy with his finger going down his throat and an audio message saying something like,  &quot;That&#39;s not guacamole (sp?).&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess you&#39;d have two choices.  An actual demonstration of something sure to gross him out, or a discussion based on a commercial, book, or article. I remember when my son was 6 or 7, he went through a phase where he did NOT want to wash his hands, for any reason, PERIOD.  I found an article explaining in very gross detail what can happen if one doesn&#39;t wash his hands.  It has never ever been an issue again.  We didn&#39;t really *discuss* it.  I just read him the article.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************************************<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/28/03 06:12:19 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&quot;You know, I could take your toothbrush and use it to clean the toilet any time without telling you.
