I have been lurking for quite sometime, and thouroughly enjoying your<br/>\nlively conversations!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Sheri and I have five great kids, Mike is 13 (and 6&#39;1&quot;...can you<br/>\nbelieve it? I can&#39;t, teehee),David is 8 1/2 (and the best speller in the<br/>\nhouse), Andrew is 7 (and has beautiful  handwriting already), Joshua is 5<br/>\n(and my future athlete), and  then there is my only girl Tirzah&#39; she is 3<br/>\n(and very dramatic). I am married, to Dale and unfortunatly he isn&#39;t very<br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest didn&#39;t learn to read until he was 10 and is only now getting<br/>\ninterested in actually doing it. His spelling is terrible, but since he<br/>\nfound the internet and has some YIM friends, he is learning. Of course now I<br/>\nhave to &quot;fight&quot; for the computer....LOL. David is the opposite, he taught<br/>\nhimself to read at age 6 and hasn&#39;t stopped. Life is never boring around<br/>\nhere! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, I live in Maine, at least for a few more months. My husband is in<br/>\nthe Coast Guard, so we move everything 3 years or so. We are due to move<br/>\nsoon. Most of the family considers moves as adventures, but my oldest is<br/>\nhaving a harder time of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I didn&#39;t mean to write a novella. hahhahaha.... I will end it here. I<br/>\nlook forward to getting to know you all better. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sheri</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23124,"nextTopicId":23125}}
