I went to ask jeeves and entered science of <br/>\ncake, found a link with a fun experiment suggesting you cook 4 cakes leaving <br/>\n1 important ingredient out of 3 of them, then compare. Here is what the site <br/>\nsaid about the science of baking:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeat helps some chemical reactions to occur as the cake bakes:<br/>\nIt helps baking powder produce tiny bubbles of gas making the cake light and <br/>\nfluffy (this is called leavening).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt causes protein from the egg to change and make the cake firm.<br/>\n<br/>\nOil keeps the heat from drying out the cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know the answers, yet I can ask the question so the idea may be <br/>\npondered. Answers are just a fragment of what learning is about. Cooking, <br/>\nexperiencing, watching powder get wet, heating, seeing change, these <br/>\nexperiences are rich. Knowing why adds to the richness.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35772,"nextTopicId":36096}}
