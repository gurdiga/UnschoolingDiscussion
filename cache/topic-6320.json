Their # is 1-888-623-6557,<br/>\ncall for a catalog.<br/>\n    Their catalog is simply beautiful and they offer much more than just<br/>\ndolls.  I have ordered from them a number of times and have always been<br/>\nhappy with the service they offer.<br/>\n    Hope this helps!<br/>\n    My name is Angela and my husband Kevin has also just joined the<br/>\nlist.  We are the homeschooling parents of two boys ages 4 (as of<br/>\ntoday!) and 5.<br/>\n     BTW, we are also pagan.<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;I saw a first quilting kit for children that included enough materials<br/>\n<br/>\n &gt;to make a couple of  items, one being the perfect size for a doll<br/>\n </span></blockquote>quilt.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;I was actually going to get it for myself!<br/>\n &gt;Kathy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> OK, where did you see it?  I would like to get it too!  I want to learn<br/>\nto<br/>\n quilt and that sounds like an unintimidating way to start.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was through Hearthsong, but I just checked the catalog<br/>\n(they<br/>\ndo have some other nice kits, knitting, looms, basket making etc).  So<br/>\nnow<br/>\nI am thinking it might have been in this catalog I can&#39;t find, something<br/>\nabout<br/>\nlog cabin dolls?  I will look around some more later and post if I find<br/>\nit.<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6314,"nextTopicId":6077}}
