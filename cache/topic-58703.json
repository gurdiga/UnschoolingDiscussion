His parents did try to &quot;teach&quot; him how to focus <br/>\non what they thought was important. He just refused to play the game. So <br/>\nmaybe he was unregulated, but it wasn&#39;t a parental choice. He was just an <br/>\nunschooler at heart. He thought that school was a &quot;waste of his time&quot; (His <br/>\nwords) and so he wouldn&#39;t bring the focus other people thought he should <br/>\nhave. He made his own choices because no one could force him to do <br/>\notherwise. He&#39;s an accomplished writer, a computer programmer, a candle <br/>\nmaker and a chef in training. It didn&#39;t matter that he didn&#39;t achieve the <br/>\nschool goals, because they weren&#39;t HIS goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;This would require quite a long essay - maybe I will find the time to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>write it one day :) but not likely, as one of the pitfalls of my<br/>\nunschooling history is, lots of good ideas but no self-regulation to put <br/>\nthem into effect!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to write, then write!! :o) Your unschooly, unstructured <br/>\nchildhood is NOT holding you back. You are holding you back. You have right <br/>\nnow, this moment, to have an idea. To jot it down. To mull it over. It took <br/>\nme 40 years to find my writing soul again. I blamed school, you blame <br/>\nunschool. But really, all we have is ourselves in THIS moment. It was very <br/>\nfreeing for me to discover that I have the power to change my path. My past <br/>\ndoes NOT have to determine my future.
