Not hate, stoicism, spite,<br/>\nimpatience, strictness, disregard, selfishness, rudeness and control of<br/>\nothers.  A teacher&#39;s commentary in the Bible on my desk right now says &quot;As<br/>\nwe yield ourselves to the Spirit, He transforms our character so that these<br/>\nwonderful virtues shine through our lives.  Ask God the Spirit to control<br/>\nyou so fully that the children you teach see this exquisite fruit in your<br/>\nlife and desire it for themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine desiring to be like a person who spends their waking hours<br/>\ntrying to control you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83528,"nextTopicId":83574}}
