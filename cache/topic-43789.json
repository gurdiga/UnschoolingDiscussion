And he remembers all kinds of <br/>\nthings about them that I forgot, even though I read him tons of books <br/>\non dinasaurs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRead up on deschooling, if you haven&#39;t already.  There is some great <br/>\nstuff about it on www.unschooling.com message boards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n She knows how to tell time, but like this morning when I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gave her the clock worksheets, she wrote down random numbers just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; get it done, then stomped off when I printed her 2 new worksheets <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; told her to do them right <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She has no need to write down the time.  She can *tell* time--that&#39;s <br/>\nall she needs right now.  Can you think of a *real* reason she has to <br/>\ndo that?  I don&#39;t know if she learned to tell time &quot;formally&quot; but I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing maybe she did.  Unschooling is about trusting she&#39;ll learn <br/>\nto tell time because she wants to know what time Daddy gets home or <br/>\nwhat time her favorite show is on, or on and on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe already made it clear she did not want to do it. In what way is <br/>\nasking her to do two more of them going to help?  If it were my dd,  <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t imagine how it could helpful in any way. I would fear, <br/>\nhowever, that she would learn that it is not ok to expresss <br/>\nherslef or her true feelings--especially to me.  And this learning <br/>\nwill transfer to all things; from not wanting to share an interest <br/>\nwith me for fear that I would turn it into a unit study, to concerns <br/>\nabout her emerging sexuality.  And even if she does go ahead and do <br/>\nthe worksheets and &quot;learns&quot; what I think she should, that other <br/>\nlearning is still happening--and *that* is the learning that will <br/>\nstick. <br/>\n  <br/>\nExamining these kinds of questions constantly--trying to live <br/>\nmindfully--has helped me tremendously and, for me,is the key to <br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy focus would be to help her say she didn&#39;t want to do it in a more <br/>\nrespectful way--but first she has to *truly trust* that it is ok to <br/>\ndo that. A common phrase of unschoolers is to &quot;Trust the Child.&quot;  For <br/>\nme is also very much about fostering their trust in you. Building <br/>\nthat trust is my main goal of unschooling; but more than that, it is <br/>\nmy main goal of parenting--of building a relationship with my <br/>\nchildren based on love and mutual trust and respect.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-because I knew she could do it.-=<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing how to tell time and how to write time are two very different <br/>\nthings.  It doesn&#39;t follow that because she can tell time, she can <br/>\nwrite it.  Even if she *can* do it, it may be a struggle for her and <br/>\none that is especially unpleasant because she doesn&#39;t have a need to <br/>\ndo it.  When she does--filling out party invitations, or keeping a <br/>\njournal--she will. Trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we go our phonics flash cards, she won&#39;t even TRY to sound <br/>\n </span></blockquote>them <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; out, she just says whatever comes to mind first.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She doesn&#39;t want to and she will likely never want to.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean in any way that she won&#39;t learn to read. She will learn to read <br/>\nwhen she has a reason to, using the tools that will help *her*.  And <br/>\nif you persist, she may learn to read in spite of or because of them, <br/>\nbut it is may very likely also learn that reading is no fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am almost ready to give up, I&#39;m near tears and I DO NOT want my <br/>\n&gt; daughter in that &quot;Special&quot; school.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you should give up the school at home and she doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\never go to that &quot;Special&quot; school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (They can read a lil, but not on thier grade levels).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are no more grade levels.

It&#39;s just that people learn in different ways. It&#39;s <br/>\ninteresting that if you look at program recommendations for <br/>\nboth &quot;challenged&quot; children and &quot;gifted&quot; children, they both emphasize <br/>\nletting them follow their interests and learn in their own way.

But she didn&#39;t want to know it bad enough to study <br/>\nit. She asked my sister (a school teacher) to show her how to <br/>\nunderstand Algebra when she was in her late teens. That lasted an <br/>\nentire hour, I think. After a few tries, she quit trying and <br/>\nconcentrated on the computer. Then when she decided to go to college, <br/>\nshe knew that algebra was one of the subjects she would have to take. <br/>\nShe has no GED, no diploma. She took the college entrance exam and <br/>\nscored high on the average. Top scores in English, Comprehension, <br/>\netc.. and barely scraping by in Math. So she took remedial math <br/>\nclasses (in college) and made all 100&#39;s. She found college to be so <br/>\neasy that she made all A&#39;s. But she wasn&#39;t bored with the classes <br/>\nlike all the other students seemed to be. (I started college at the <br/>\nsame time and we had some classes together). She truly enjoys <br/>\nlearning. She had no preset notion of making all A&#39;s. She seldom even <br/>\nthought about the grades, she just loved all topics, rarely studying. <br/>\nShe&#39;d hear it once and remember it. So, after the first semester when <br/>\nshe found she had all A&#39;s, she decided to try to keep the A average. <br/>\nShe went on to make an A in college algebra. Then she decided to try <br/>\nStatistics because her remedial math professor was teaching it, and <br/>\nshe loved her remedial math professor. They are still close friends. <br/>\nAnyway, she fell in love with statistics and just kept taking more.<br/>\n <br/>\nI say if your daughter wants to do math, then let her.

In many ways, they were right. When traveling to another country, <br/>\nit is important for all new citizens to take inoculations. When traveling <br/>\nto Homeschooolland, it is necessary for all new citizens to &quot;detox&quot;--to rid <br/>\nthemselves of the deleterious effects that Publicschoolland has had on <br/>\ntheir education.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore beginning this &quot;detox&quot; process, one must carefully analyze the <br/>\nLearning environment that exists in Publicschoolland and take note of it&#39;s <br/>\ninherent qualities. In Publicschoolland all of the citizens are carefully <br/>\ncontrolled. All movement occurs at the sound of a bell. Performing <br/>\nnecessary bodily functions is discouraged, and access to the bathroom is <br/>\nmonitored by a teacher. The citizens are told what to learn, when to begin <br/>\nlearning, and when to stop learning. Failure to learn at the proscribed <br/>\npace (be it too slow or too fast) is punishable with failing grades and/or <br/>\nsheer boredom. Citizens are not permitted to leave Publischoolland for 12 <br/>\nyears, unless they obtain an exit visa and travel to Homeschoolland. Once <br/>\nPublic- schoolland citizens obtain their exit visa, they will need help <br/>\nacclimating themselves to the new learning environment of Homeschoolland.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese new citizens will need the following things from The Homeschoolland <br/>\n&quot;Consulate General&quot; (the parent) to aid in this &quot;detox&quot; process:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Freedom. The freedom to move about during the day from one subject area <br/>\nto another according to the citizen&#39;s own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Faith. Faith in the fact that human curiosity and intelligence need not <br/>\nbe &quot;stimulated&quot; in order for learning to take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Patience. Patience during the entire &quot;detox&quot; time.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Time. Time to distress from the regimented learning process. (This time <br/>\nperiod can last anywhere from one month to one year).<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon arriving in Homeschoolland, new citizens often feel a little <br/>\ndisoriented and confused. In this first phase of &quot;detox&quot;, they will expect <br/>\na teacher to tell them everything that they need to know about a subject. <br/>\nThey may not know where to look to obtain knowledge for themselves. While <br/>\ntextbooks are familiar, the new citizen will, most likely, hold them in <br/>\ncontempt. Stay as far away from textbooks as possible during the &quot;detox&quot; <br/>\ntime. Allow the new citizens to fill their first days in Homeschoolland <br/>\nwith unstructured playtime and healthy, positive, social interaction with <br/>\nsiblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the new citizens express an interest in &quot;doing something&quot; or &quot;learning <br/>\nabout something&quot;, phase two of the &quot;detox&quot; process has already begun. <br/>\nRespond gently and slowly to the citizens first tentative steps into <br/>\nHomeschoolland. Share in their sense of wonder, as they begin to see all of <br/>\nthe learning possibilities that exist in Homeschoolland. The Consulate <br/>\nGeneral must reassure the citizens that he/she is &quot;here for them&quot; and will <br/>\nhelp them find the information they need; without giving it to them. The <br/>\ntricky part of phase two is keeping a clear head. The Consulate General <br/>\nmust resist all urges to &quot;teach&quot; or to make the new citizens &quot;get something <br/>\nout of&quot; a teaching moment. The Consulate General may guide, encourage, and <br/>\ncheer, but they should not contrive &quot;learning experiences&quot; or &quot;lesson <br/>\nplans&quot;. Soon enough, the new citizens will be so &quot;stimulated&quot; by the <br/>\nlearning environment in Homeschoolland, that the Consulate General will <br/>\nfind it hard to keep up with them. When this happens, the citizens have <br/>\nentered phase three of the &quot;detox&quot; process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough the Consulate General will be tempted, he/she must not rush the new <br/>\ncitizens through phase three. This phase is the most important phase of the <br/>\n&quot;detox&quot; and transition process. During this time, the citizens will be <br/>\nrebuilding their fragile sense of self-esteem as well as relearning how to <br/>\nlearn. They may revert to easier tasks or simpler reading books, but do not <br/>\nbe alarmed. They are simply rediscovering the thirst for knowledge that <br/>\nthey had at a younger age--but were forbidden to quench in <br/>\nPublicschoolland. Be Patient! Some citizens require more time than others <br/>\nto &quot;detox&quot; and adjust to Homeschoolland.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Consulate General should use this &quot;detox&quot; time period to decide which <br/>\nlearning method, materials and approach will be most effective for the new <br/>\ncitizens. In the near future, the citizens will be willing and able to <br/>\noffer input into this decision making process. When this happens, the <br/>\nConsulate General will know that the &quot;detox&quot; process is complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the new citizens can relax and enjoy all of the educational <br/>\nopportunities that Homeschoolland has to offer. Remember, Homeschoolland is <br/>\nmuch more than a nice place to visit, it is a GREAT place to live!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105774918,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Want To Unschool In Ga","postDate":"1031864064","msgId":43833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyNWE5ZSQ5NzAxYjdjMCQwMzAwYThjMEBjb2J1cm4+","inReplyToHeader":"PEYxMTdDaTZueDhkeURkM09KWHMwMDAwMjM2MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43828,"nextInTopic":43848,"prevInTime":43832,"nextInTime":43834,"topicId":43789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Think about<br/>\nhow you and all the adults around you learn new things. I do it by reading<br/>\ninteresting books (sometimes from the kids section of the store) looking for<br/>\nTV programs that talk aboutthe topic, talking to others with experiences,<br/>\nand actually DOing. All of this becasue it is something I am interested in.<br/>\nNobody makes up a leesson plan, nobody sets up a table ful of manipulatives<br/>\nor asks me to write a report. I find the info **because I want to know<br/>\nmore**. I&#39;m curious and I actively seek out  the info on my own. Sometimes<br/>\nDH will mention he met someone who does what I m learning about. Sometimes<br/>\nEmily (dd)will point out a TV show, but for the most part, it&#39;s all from me.<br/>\nHere&#39;s the hard part to believe when first finding unschooling. Your<br/>\ndaughters will do this too. When something is interesting, they will not<br/>\nleave it alone until all their curiosity is satisfied. Sometimes that will<br/>\nbe one questioned answered, sometimes it will turn into a lifelong passion,<br/>\nbut mostly their interest level will fall somewhere between those two<br/>\nlevels.<br/>\nWe son&#39;t have to get in their way and set up unit studies, or write learning<br/>\nobjectives or set up hands on projects, in order to get them to learn. We<br/>\nneed to act as facilitators, rather than teachers. *offering* resources to<br/>\nthem but not requiring that they take them. Think about how you would let a<br/>\nfriend know you saw something related to a hobby they may have. Casually<br/>\nmentioning it in passing or giving something as a gift. That&#39;s how we<br/>\nunschoolers help our kids learn. And we do this because we love and care<br/>\nabout them, not because we feel that they &quot;should&quot; learn, they &quot;need to know<br/>\nthis&quot; or any of that school based nonsense.<br/>\nStart allowing them (and YOU) to &quot;de-school&quot; let all those years of forced<br/>\nlearning be shed. Allow their natural curiosity and desire to learn shine<br/>\nforth again.

We&#39;ll probably use wood glue instead of nails,<br/>\n&gt;but I think that&#39;ll be fun and they both jumped up and down excited<br/>\n&gt;when I asked if they would like to make one.

The teachers have<br/>\n&gt; tried repeatedly <br/>\n&gt; since she was in pre-school to get me to put her on<br/>\n&gt; ritalin and into <br/>\n&gt; a &quot;Special&quot; school because &quot;They&quot; determined she had<br/>\n&gt; ADHD.  I fought <br/>\n&gt; long and hard, and finally found a child<br/>\n&gt; psychologist that changed <br/>\n&gt; her diet when she was 5, and she&#39;s doing MUCH MUCH<br/>\n&gt; better.  I will <br/>\n&gt; not and do not want to drug her, nor put her in a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Special&quot; school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK last year, the school started sending out<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Evaluation&quot; letters for <br/>\n&gt; my 8 year old daughter who is NOT hyper, nor<br/>\n&gt; anything like my 7 year <br/>\n&gt; old.  These were the same forms they used on my 7<br/>\n&gt; year old, before <br/>\n&gt; they determined she had ADHD.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To make a long story short, my girls can&#39;t read, and<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s not THEIR <br/>\n&gt; FAULT.  They are not dumb, nor retarded (sorry for<br/>\n&gt; the rude word but <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s what they try to say about my 7 year old).  I<br/>\n&gt; finally got fed <br/>\n&gt; up last year and pulled them otu, figuring I could<br/>\n&gt; teach them to read <br/>\n&gt; one on one much better than the SORRY teachers<br/>\n&gt; could.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OK since then, the 8 year old has improved ALOT. <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s a lil Math <br/>\n&gt; genius, and can grasp math quicker than I can<br/>\n&gt; believe.  So I can say <br/>\n&gt; that homeschooling for her has gone GREAT except for<br/>\n&gt; the fact she <br/>\n&gt; does not like doing seatwork.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 7 year old, I&#39;m about at my wits end now and can<br/>\n&gt; understand why <br/>\n&gt; the teachers couldn&#39;t teach her.  She is SMART but<br/>\n&gt; WILL NOT apply <br/>\n&gt; herself.  She knows how to tell time, but like this<br/>\n&gt; morning when I <br/>\n&gt; gave her the clock worksheets, she wrote down random<br/>\n&gt; numbers just to <br/>\n&gt; get it done, then stomped off when I printed her 2<br/>\n&gt; new worksheets and <br/>\n&gt; told her to do them right because I knew she could<br/>\n&gt; do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we go our phonics flash cards, she won&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; TRY to sound them <br/>\n&gt; out, she just says whatever comes to mind first.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am almost ready to give up, I&#39;m near tears and I<br/>\n&gt; DO NOT want my <br/>\n&gt; daughter in that &quot;Special&quot; school.  I was looking<br/>\n&gt; for homeschooling <br/>\n&gt; help resources trying to find a support group for<br/>\n&gt; children with ADHD <br/>\n&gt; children when I stumbled across a site that<br/>\n&gt; mentioned unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So far I have read for 2 hours, and I think this may<br/>\n&gt; be what we <br/>\n&gt; need!!!  I know both my girls would LOVE to learn,<br/>\n&gt; by doing fun <br/>\n&gt; things instead of seatwork and memorizing, but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know how to <br/>\n&gt; begin and how to start unschooling them so they can<br/>\n&gt; learn to read.  <br/>\n&gt; (They can read a lil, but not on thier grade<br/>\n&gt; levels).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any helpful tips and advice sure would be<br/>\n&gt; appreciated.  Especially in <br/>\n&gt; the reading area.  Because they are both smart as a<br/>\n&gt; whip, if I teach <br/>\n&gt; them somehting to do with Science, they remember it,<br/>\n&gt; and they catch <br/>\n&gt; onto Math quick.  But the not being able to read is<br/>\n&gt; killing me, and <br/>\n&gt; frustrating them because they want to be able to<br/>\n&gt; read books alone <br/>\n&gt; likethier big sister does (She&#39;s 13 and still in<br/>\n&gt; piblic school, she <br/>\n&gt; is agifted child that taught herself to read and was<br/>\n&gt; reading on 4th <br/>\n&gt; grade level by time she was 4, so I left her in<br/>\n&gt; publicschools so she <br/>\n&gt; could participate in all the progras she&#39;d already<br/>\n&gt; joined).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think I let my oldest daughters succes blind me to<br/>\n&gt; how difficult it <br/>\n&gt; is for a child to learn.  Then I thought the school<br/>\n&gt; would have them <br/>\n&gt; reading.  Then I woke up and realized I best do<br/>\n&gt; something quick <br/>\n&gt; because the blasted school system DOESN&#39;T CARE if<br/>\n&gt; they can do <br/>\n&gt; anything, all they care about is &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and on to the next <br/>\n&gt; student.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also I wanted to try hooked on phonics, but that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too expensive for <br/>\n&gt; our budget right now.

My dryer broke so I went to hang clothes out on the line.  <br/>\nMy 8 year old daughter (Mariah) followed me and asked how they got <br/>\ndry like that (She&#39;s so used to the dryer doing the work) so I turned <br/>\nthat into a lesson where I explained about evaporation, clouds and <br/>\nrain.  We&#39;re fixing to go let her boil a small pot of water so she <br/>\ncan watch it disappear, and freeze a soap mold full of water so she <br/>\ncan make a cube of ice that looks like a butterfly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also asked if they wanted to make birdhouses so I&#39;m going to look <br/>\nfor a simple birdhouse to make, and let them measure it and build it <br/>\nthemselves tomorrow.  We&#39;ll probably use wood glue instead of nails, <br/>\nbut I think that&#39;ll be fun and they both jumped up and down excited <br/>\nwhen I asked if they would like to make one. Maybe that can turn into <br/>\na lesson on birds.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now they are watching rat race with the closed captioning <br/>\nturned on, I saw that at another unschooling site, about if they want <br/>\nto watch TV let them, just turn the captions on so they can be <br/>\nlearning word recognition without even realizing it.  (Oh I was so <br/>\nhappy to find that tip)  and rat race is a pretty clean movie, <br/>\nsuitable for their age.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling sounds like so much fun, for both me and the girls.  And <br/>\nI never realized that maybe Mirial (the 7 year old) was trying to <br/>\ntell me something, by refusing to do her seatwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nMariah asks alot of questions, so it&#39;ll be easy to seek opportunities <br/>\nto teach when she asks (like she did with the clothes) but Mirial is, <br/>\nwell like she&#39;s in her own little world.  When I was hanging clothes, <br/>\nMariah stood right by me and hung onto every word.  Whereas Mirial <br/>\ntook off to the other end of the clothesline and tried to swing on <br/>\nit, then started digging in the grass, then went towards the creek, <br/>\nthen went and jumped off the porch, then tried to swing her lil <br/>\nsister off the porch (Baby is 1 1/2 and I also have a son that&#39;s 4), <br/>\nthen went and threw some wood off the porch, then tried to roll the <br/>\ntrash can through the backyard.  That resulted in as much excersise <br/>\nfor me, chasing her, as it did with her running around.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s very active, and I still haven&#39;t found any unschooling ideas <br/>\nfor a child that doesn&#39;t want to sit still for more than aminute, she <br/>\nalways has to gogogogogo.  Like right now, she&#39;s not paying rat race <br/>\nany attention, she&#39;s got her hands and feet between the door posts <br/>\nand is climbing up the doorway like a lil spidergirl.  PE will be no <br/>\nproblem for her, but I don&#39;t know if she can actually learn if she <br/>\ncan&#39;t even stay still long enough to listen to one sentence.  I can&#39;t <br/>\neven read to her, because we&#39;ll be reading a book, and she&#39;ll look at <br/>\nthe pictures and get to wanting to go see a bird, or ride a bike, or <br/>\ndo anythign that is realted to the picture.  BUT for the rare times <br/>\nshe does sit still, I can tell her something ONE time, and she <br/>\nremembers it.  Like telling time, it took two days for mariah to <br/>\ngrasp it, but Mirial took to it the first time I told her.  So i know <br/>\nshe&#39;s not dumb.  The not wanting to sit still is why they wanted to <br/>\nput her on ritalin, I can handle it, it doesn&#39;t bother me a bit,but <br/>\nwhen I need her to learn it does make me wonder if I can do the job <br/>\nof teaching her properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have even taken them to the park, thinking a few hours of HARD play <br/>\nwould help her calm down a bit to learn.  No luck, that child can go <br/>\nfor hours on end and not get the least bit tired.  When we get home, <br/>\nthe other kids will go right off to sleep because they are so tired, <br/>\nwhereas Mirial just wants to jump on the bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post, but you&#39;d have to understand Mirial, in <br/>\norder to understand why i&#39;m having doubts about whether I can do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117801964,"authorName":"MO Milligans","from":"MO Milligans &lt;Ozarkren@...&gt;","profile":"trozark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Want To Unschool In Ga","postDate":"1031848296","msgId":43798,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMi4yMDAyMDkxMjExMjAzNi4wMDllYjhhMEBlZGlzb24ucmlwaW50ZXJuZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGFscWI4YisycTB2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43797,"nextInTopic":43799,"prevInTime":43797,"nextInTime":43799,"topicId":43789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == For the LONGEST time I thought my daughter would never read on her own.

(The approach I&#39;m describing could be<br/>\n&quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; or &quot;unit-studies&quot; or &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people come into the unschooling forum just to find out about the<br/>\nfun resources.  Others come to change their way of life.  We may TRY to<br/>\npersuade you to &quot;unschool all the way&quot;, but we can&#39;t actually force you.<br/>\n &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually have a homeschooling mom friend who was on Ritalin herself as<br/>\na child.  I think the school system just couldn&#39;t accomodate her<br/>\nkinesthetic learning style.  Her oldest daughter is also a kinesthetic<br/>\nlearner.  I might be able to recruit her to talk to you if you have<br/>\nspecific issues you need reassurance about.  You can email me privately<br/>\nif you need to follow up on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in a big city and the libraries here carry Hooked on Phonics and<br/>\nthe Phonics Game. So check your library, if you haven&#39;t done that<br/>\nalready.  Some of my homeschooled friends (who aren&#39;t unschooling)<br/>\nrecommend the book Reading Reflex, which I would guess only costs about<br/>\n$20.  My son (now 8) really learned a lot about reading from watching<br/>\nthe PBS show, Between the Lions.  He liked it because it&#39;s funny. <br/>\n(Resources at my house have to be more than fun -- they have to be<br/>\nfunny, or my son won&#39;t touch them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids aren&#39;t early readers, they can learn a lot from books that mom<br/>\nreads to them, audio books on tape (especially in the car) and videos.<br/>\nAnd, of course, they can learn from hands-on experience.  Science and<br/>\nhistory videos are popular at my house.  I&#39;ve been taping the new<br/>\nrevolutionary war cartoon, Liberty&#39;s Kids, on PBS.

Meaning you <br/>\ndon&#39;t make them do worksheets and sit down and do seat work and so on. You <br/>\nrelax and let them stay home with you and go places with you and do what <br/>\nthey would like to do. And many many days it will seem like all they do is <br/>\nplay. And that&#39;s okay too because they also learn so much just by playing. <br/>\nAs parents we make sure that our children have all kinso f resources around <br/>\nthe house. Tons of books, which aren&#39;t all childrens books. And toys and fun <br/>\nstuff like arts and crafts and building materials and animals and so on. We <br/>\nprovide all the &quot;stuff&quot; and just let them have at it. There are some things <br/>\nthat may go untouched for years, but then they will discover it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 and 7 year olds have taught themselves how to read just like they <br/>\nlearned to swim and walk. I was there watching of course, (well not all the <br/>\ntime with the walking and reading!) but they did it themselves when &quot;they&quot; <br/>\nwere ready regardless of what I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy SIL told me about fantastic swim lessons for the kids. I asked them if <br/>\nthey wanted to go and they said no. Well she didn&#39;t think that was a good <br/>\nidea here in FL. That I should have, for their own good, taken them. Why?? <br/>\nThey didn&#39;t want to go. And now they swim like fish with no pushing and no <br/>\ncrying over lessons they didn&#39;t want. Same thing happened with the reading. <br/>\nWhy should I make them sit down and force them to do things they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto do? When they are ready, they will get it on their own. Really they will.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like your daughter is trying to tell you that. If you know she knows <br/>\nthings and she&#39;s putting things down to get them over with, she&#39;s telling <br/>\nyou she doesn&#39;t like doing it. And if you keep making her, she will get <br/>\nworse.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo just play with your kids and let them play and read to them a lot and <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry about them reading to themselves. It will all come. And just be <br/>\nthere for them to do things with and answer questions for them and help when <br/>\nthey ask for it. If you watch your kids they will give you all the signs of <br/>\nwhat they need and want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117165865,"authorName":"Jennifer Green","from":"&quot;Jennifer Green&quot; &lt;heartlightdfw@...&gt;","profile":"heartlightdfw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Want To Unschool In Ga","postDate":"1031845484","msgId":43794,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMTcwMWMyNWE3MyQ1Mjg0MzQ5MCQzZDM2ZWUwY0BzYm1zLnNiYy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGFscWI4YisycTB2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43793,"nextInTopic":43797,"prevInTime":43793,"nextInTime":43795,"topicId":43789,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maria, welcome to the group.

The first thing to do is to sit down and take a deep breath.  :-)  You may have found in your unschooling research that unschooling is letting the children be the leaders of their lives.  It may take a while for them to deschool, but when they do you will find them bringing up subjects and asking you to help with whatever they are interested in.  Don&#39;t worry, just trust they will know what they need at any given time.

I started homeschooling them <br/>\n  last year, right at the last of the school year, because of several <br/>\n  factors.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My main factor was my 7 year old.  The teachers have tried repeatedly <br/>\n  since she was in pre-school to get me to put her on ritalin and into <br/>\n  a &quot;Special&quot; school because &quot;They&quot; determined she had ADHD.  I fought <br/>\n  long and hard, and finally found a child psychologist that changed <br/>\n  her diet when she was 5, and she&#39;s doing MUCH MUCH better.  I will <br/>\n  not and do not want to drug her, nor put her in a &quot;Special&quot; school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK last year, the school started sending out &quot;Evaluation&quot; letters for <br/>\n  my 8 year old daughter who is NOT hyper, nor anything like my 7 year <br/>\n  old.  These were the same forms they used on my 7 year old, before <br/>\n  they determined she had ADHD.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  To make a long story short, my girls can&#39;t read, and it&#39;s not THEIR <br/>\n  FAULT.  They are not dumb, nor retarded (sorry for the rude word but <br/>\n  that&#39;s what they try to say about my 7 year old).  I finally got fed <br/>\n  up last year and pulled them otu, figuring I could teach them to read <br/>\n  one on one much better than the SORRY teachers could.<br/>\n<br/>\n  OK since then, the 8 year old has improved ALOT.  She&#39;s a lil Math <br/>\n  genius, and can grasp math quicker than I can believe.  So I can say <br/>\n  that homeschooling for her has gone GREAT except for the fact she <br/>\n  does not like doing seatwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My 7 year old, I&#39;m about at my wits end now and can understand why <br/>\n  the teachers couldn&#39;t teach her.  She is SMART but WILL NOT apply <br/>\n  herself.  She knows how to tell time, but like this morning when I <br/>\n  gave her the clock worksheets, she wrote down random numbers just to <br/>\n  get it done, then stomped off when I printed her 2 new worksheets and <br/>\n  told her to do them right because I knew she could do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When we go our phonics flash cards, she won&#39;t even TRY to sound them <br/>\n  out, she just says whatever comes to mind first.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am almost ready to give up, I&#39;m near tears and I DO NOT want my <br/>\n  daughter in that &quot;Special&quot; school.  I was looking for homeschooling <br/>\n  help resources trying to find a support group for children with ADHD <br/>\n  children when I stumbled across a site that mentioned unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So far I have read for 2 hours, and I think this may be what we <br/>\n  need!!!  I know both my girls would LOVE to learn, by doing fun <br/>\n  things instead of seatwork and memorizing, but I don&#39;t know how to <br/>\n  begin and how to start unschooling them so they can learn to read.  <br/>\n  (They can read a lil, but not on thier grade levels).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any helpful tips and advice sure would be appreciated.  Especially in <br/>\n  the reading area.  Because they are both smart as a whip, if I teach <br/>\n  them somehting to do with Science, they remember it, and they catch <br/>\n  onto Math quick.  But the not being able to read is killing me, and <br/>\n  frustrating them because they want to be able to read books alone <br/>\n  likethier big sister does (She&#39;s 13 and still in piblic school, she <br/>\n  is agifted child that taught herself to read and was reading on 4th <br/>\n  grade level by time she was 4, so I left her in publicschools so she <br/>\n  could participate in all the progras she&#39;d already joined).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think I let my oldest daughters succes blind me to how difficult it <br/>\n  is for a child to learn.  Then I thought the school would have them <br/>\n  reading.
