We &quot;unschooled&quot; and didn&#39;t know it until he started ps <br/>\nschool.  We homeschooled kindergarten because he was already reading, <br/>\nwriting, multiplying, etc. and the teachers flat out told us he would <br/>\nbe bored stiff.   We did send him to ps for 2 years and realized that <br/>\nwas definitely not the best thing for our family.  Since then, we&#39;ve <br/>\nused Abeka and BJU.  Last year we tried unschooling for a few months <br/>\nbut he felt he needed more structure and even got teary that he felt <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t know how to study anymore.   This year we went back to <br/>\nbooks but I still feel like he&#39;s restricted and there&#39;s so much, esp. <br/>\nhistory that he wants to study, that maybe we should unschool again.  <br/>\nHe is concerned with not learning everything he feels he should <br/>\nlearn, like different grammar terms, science facts, math, etc. and <br/>\nyet he wants days, like today, where he reads literature, draws, does <br/>\nmath, internet and playstation.  Do I mix it up, letting him have <br/>\ndays like today and then on days he feels the need for structure, use <br/>\nthe books?  I mean, is that basically the unschooling, letting him <br/>\ndecide that day what to do?<br/>\nDeeAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88111,"nextTopicId":88052}}
