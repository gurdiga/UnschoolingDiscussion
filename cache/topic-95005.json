The problems multiply if they not only settle there, but set up <br/>\nshop as unschooling meeter-greeters -- without disclosing that UnschoolingWorld <br/>\nis really still a couple of hundred miles down the road. <br/>\n<br/>\n       It reminds me of the signs implying you&#39;ve reached the gates of <br/>\nDisneyWorld, while you&#39;re still a couple of counties north (with children very ready <br/>\nto be there NOW.) Yes, travelers perhaps have come a long way and they&#39;re on <br/>\nthe right road, and that&#39;s good -- but it&#39;s a problem if you stop in Ocala and <br/>\nthen badmouth DisneyWorld forevermore as nothing but horsefarms and highway!  <br/>\n   JJ<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sometimes you have to meet a person where they are at.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While talking about the concept of unschooling might be beneficial, maybe<br/>\n&gt; just talking about each small step as it comes up will be more beneficial<br/>\n&gt; depending on the circumstances and the forum.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Recently at a homeschool meeting I went to, someone was looking for an<br/>\n&gt; easier way to teach penmanship than making her kids write for 30 minutes<br/>\n&gt; every day, which they hated and fought.  (they were only 7 and 8) The mom<br/>\n&gt; was miles away from getting unschooling and maybe didn&#39;t even know what it<br/>\n&gt; was.  I gave my opinion.... that I felt it was a left brain/right brain<br/>\n&gt; thing and some people were just good at it and found it easy and others<br/>\n&gt; would always have a hard time and have messy writing, so forcing practice<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t really make a huge difference in the long run.  But this is a mom who<br/>\n&gt; feels that practice makes perfect, so telling her to ..just not worry about<br/>\n&gt; it.....didn&#39;t really reach her.  Someone else offered a suggestion of a game<br/>\n&gt; that involves writing, but much less writing than she otherwise would have<br/>\n&gt; her children do.  The mom embraced the idea of a game and slacking off on<br/>\n&gt; her standards of writing for 30 minutes a day.  The person giving the advice<br/>\n&gt; leans heavily toward unschooling and I was surprised at her advice.  I<br/>\n&gt; talked with her alone afterwards and she mentioned to me what I said above,<br/>\n&gt; that sometimes you have to meet a person where they are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I did her  disservice by talking how an unschooler approaches<br/>\n&gt; penmanship but perhaps the person offering her something concrete to do,<br/>\n&gt; gave her advice that she will actually use.  Maybe some day she&#39;ll put it<br/>\n&gt; all together and get unschooling but maybe not.  Either way, her kids have<br/>\n&gt; it a little easier now getting to play a game, instead of having the do copy<br/>\n&gt; work for 30 minutes a day.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95092,"nextTopicId":95096}}
