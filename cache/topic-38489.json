As for the constipation she <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t like the prune juice from Gerber, but try a jar of baby plums. <br/>\nYes, applesauce will constipate!!! As for eating like a bird, feed her like a <br/>\nbird. Example meal served at our house: Oven fried chicken, peas, biscuits, <br/>\npeach cobbler. When Moly was tiny I would give her two or three small bites <br/>\nof chicken, a tablespoon or two of peas and half of a biscuit. Then maybe 45 <br/>\nminutes to an hour later I would give her a couple tablespoons full of <br/>\ncobbler. I fed her like this all day long, every two hours or so I would <br/>\noffer a small chunk of cheese, a handful of grapes, maybe some cereal.  1/4 <br/>\nof a p.b.&j sandwich or grilled cheese for lunch. This gave her the <br/>\nopportunity to try new foods in small amounts and not overwhelm her with too <br/>\nmuch food. Remember a small child&#39;s stomach is not much bigger than your <br/>\nthumb (maybe just smaller than the palm of their hands) so how much can <br/>\nreally fit in there? If Darin would dish up her plate, her little eyes would <br/>\nget so big and she would just pick. He learned quickly that her tummy was <br/>\nsaying NO WAY is all that going to get down here!
