I WAS ASKED TO <br/>\nPASS IT ON&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n__---<br/>\nAgnes,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just called and spoke with vice principal Jeffrey Andreano of <br/>\nOleans <br/>\nhigh<br/>\nschool at length.  He was very open to discussing the incident and <br/>\nnot <br/>\nat all<br/>\ndefensive.  Here is the story from his pov.  The principal told the <br/>\nstudent he<br/>\ncould not hang the posters up (because that is a school policy to <br/>\nprevent all<br/>\nsorts of opinion posters, hate speech, etc.  from being posted).  <br/>\nPosters<br/>\nadvertising an event (such as a peace rally) are allowed, but not <br/>\n&quot;opinion&quot;<br/>\nposters.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, the student approached individual teachers and received <br/>\npermission (even<br/>\nthough, again, it&#39;s not really school policy).  When the Vice <br/>\nPrincipal <br/>\nlearned<br/>\nthat the student had received permission, he removed the detention.  <br/>\n(Indeed,<br/>\nthe vice principal complimented the student on the wording for <br/>\npeace, <br/>\netc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, people are leaving nasty voicemails at Oleans high <br/>\nschool <br/>\nwith no<br/>\nnames because they are not hearing the entire story (and are not <br/>\nwilling to take<br/>\nresponsiblity for their own actions).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I applaud the spirit of this e-mail message, I am very much <br/>\nconcerned that<br/>\nwe are not getting the whole picture, and that this is simply making <br/>\nthe peace<br/>\nmovement look somewhat incompetent, gullible, and as if we are not <br/>\ndoing our<br/>\nhomework.  Perhaps we should hear from the student Jeff Chandler <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wouldn&#39;t mind forwarding this to everyone that you originally <br/>\nsent the<br/>\nmessage to, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreta Niu<br/>\nAssistant Professor of English<br/>\nBrockport College</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60899,"nextTopicId":60869}}
