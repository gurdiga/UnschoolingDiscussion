I read about a case<br/>\nwhere a mother had called social services on  her own daughter because she<br/>\nfelt her daughter&#39;s house was unsafe for her grandkids because it was so<br/>\nfilthy.  From what the mother said, she wanted social services to teach the<br/>\ndaughter how to keep her house neater and safer.  Social services would help<br/>\nher out.  The reason it was in the paper, is that the house (mobile home)<br/>\nburned to the ground a few months later and the mom was blaming social<br/>\nservices for not helping out when she asked them too.  The fire started<br/>\nbecause of a faulty appliance though.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy first question was why didn&#39;t the mother help her daughter clean if she<br/>\ncared so much about the grand kids.  At one point the mother lived with her<br/>\ndaughter and grandkids, but said she had to move out because it was too<br/>\ngross.  Anyway, the whole point of this story was that a filthy house might<br/>\nnot be enough reason to have social services involved, depending on the<br/>\nstate you live in.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela in Maine- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschooling@...\">unschooling@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/\">http://userpages.prexar.com/rickshaw/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.&quot;<br/>\nEmerson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone worry about social services being called on them because <br/>\nof how their kids dress, how their house looks, or even just the fact <br/>\nthat their child isn&#39;t reading?

But<br/>\n&gt; she still fights like mad to keep from getting her hair combed, so I almost<br/>\n&gt; never comb it.  She ends up looking very messy and.well.uncombed.  Once or<br/>\n&gt; twice a week I force her to have it washed and combed. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just let me state that I could have written this post about my 3.5yo dd. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mind if her hair is messy at home, but if we are going somewhere I try <br/>\nto have it look neat. I guess to me it&#39;s the same idea as not taking her in <br/>\npublic wearing stained or ripped clothing. The more I write here, I&#39;m <br/>\nrealizing that it&#39;s because I care what people think about how we look and <br/>\nthat she probably doesn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s butt about that.  LOL  I&#39;m interested <br/>\nin hearing advice about this since the times I try to deal with the hair <br/>\nthing usually leaves her upset and me feeling like crap. <br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nE-mail me for a list of used <br/>\nhomeschooling books for sale!<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;\">http://www.ubah.com/ecommerce/default.asp?sid=Z0939&gid=462366&quot;</a>&gt;Shop:  Usborne Books!&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58784,"nextTopicId":58974}}
