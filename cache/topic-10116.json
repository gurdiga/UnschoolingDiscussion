I am new to the list, and I would like to learn as much about <br/>\nhomeschooling and unschooling as possible.  Can you recommend some books to <br/>\nstart me on my journey?  I would like to focus on those books which are <br/>\npractical rather than theoretical, and those which are secular in nature.  I <br/>\nam reading &quot;Family Matters&quot; right now and find it far too general -- I need <br/>\nsomething with the specifics and mechanics of how homeschooling/unschooling <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne book I would like an opinion on is &quot;Homeschooling: The Early Years&quot; by  <br/>\nLinda Dobson.  I would also like to know which of these is more useful -- <br/>\n&quot;The Homeschooling Handbook&quot; or &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith.<br/>\n<br/>\nFINALLY, I would love to know how unschoolers feel about following a loose <br/>\ncurriculum for math and reading, but unschooling for &quot;everything else.&quot;  If <br/>\nthe child and parent feel comfortable with this arrangement, is it a good one?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much -- I look forward to reading this list!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10114,"nextTopicId":10119}}
