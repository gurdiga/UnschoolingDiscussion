Picture me dropping my shorts, sitting on a rock and peeing down hill into my shorts, right next to the campfire in full view of everyone.  Now picture not very nurturing exhubby pitching me into the tent in disgust.

You crack me up.  This reminds me of the time I got caught so to speak.  It was downtown in a parking garage.  It was late and I was pregnant having no idea where we might find a bathroom I slipped behind a parked car.  That&#39;s when we heard a group of people walking up the ramp from a lower level.  My girlfriend pretended to be looking for her keys in her hand bag and noticed my little stream flowing down hill and started laughing.  The group of people suddenly went sighlent and continued on past and quickly got into there car and closed the doors.  We could still hear them giggling and squealing though.  Anyway it wasn&#39;t until telling my story to some friends years latter that I realized that the reason they stopped talking was because they entered the parking level at a lower height and could *see* me peeing from under the car.
