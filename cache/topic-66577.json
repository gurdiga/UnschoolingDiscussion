I&#39;ve had quite a few of these moments while growing up. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t like to know what my xmas gifts were ahead of time and was<br/>\nnever the kid trying to find the stash and see what I was getting.<br/>\nKnowing this, my mom would still SHOW me what she picked out and then<br/>\nASK me if I liked it.  Thinking that if I answered honestly that she&#39;d<br/>\nstill have plenty of time to return/exchange it that we&#39;d all be happy.****<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOH THIS WAS ME!!!  I left off the last sentence because THAT wsn&#39;t me, but <br/>\nthe above was SO me!  Every year before birthdays and Christmas, the kids <br/>\nand I make a big day of wish lists.  I grab pen and paper and we go wishing. <br/>\n  For years, I got every item on the list.  It didn&#39;t take long for them to <br/>\nsulk if something was missing.  Last year, I decided to chuck the list.  We <br/>\nstill go wishing but I leave the list at home now.  I told everyone in my <br/>\nfamily to buy whatever they wanted my children to have.   wouldn&#39;t even give <br/>\nthem ideas.  Christmas was AMAZING!!!  The kids were so excited and <br/>\nsurprised at what they got.  I didn&#39;t hear ONE sulk.  My 6 year old even <br/>\nasked me if she could have a &quot;surprise&quot; birthday this year.  Not the typical <br/>\nsurprise, we&#39;re all here, but the kind without lists.  Her birthday is in 2 <br/>\nweeks and she told me she doesn&#39;t even want to go wishing because she wants <br/>\nEVERYTHING to be something special we all pick for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny that we can&#39;t see how much our desire to please our kids truly <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t please them afterall.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\">http://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66553,"nextTopicId":66581}}
