That one moment of realization made all the difference in my <br/>\n    perception of Landon as &quot;old enough&quot; to withstand this or that. Or to do <br/>\n    without &quot;this or that&quot;  Yes, compared to a newborn, even compared to Ethan at 3 <br/>\n    and Anna at 5, he WAS older, more mature and capable.. BUT, he was still just 8 <br/>\n    years old.  I thought of it in terms of what if he was an only child at 8?  8 <br/>\n    is 8 whether you are the only child or the oldest of a whole brood.  ( or the <br/>\n    oldest of 2 children). <br/>\n<br/>\n      In this epiphany, I also realized where a lot of my husband&#39;s relationship <br/>\n    with his family came from.

His parents relied heavily on him <br/>\n    to be the big helper, the leader, the one they could count on..
