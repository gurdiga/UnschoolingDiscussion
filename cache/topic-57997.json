If I remember correctly,<br/>\n  he said that if a kid came to a sticking point in math, the best way to get them<br/>\n  beyond it was to move forward. Go on to the higher math and when they see the concept<br/>\n  being used, they will more easily understand it. Not sure if I am explaining it well, he <br/>\n  did a much better job! I can&#39;t seem to find my issue though...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can empathize with you on the stopping if he does not get it on the first try. My <br/>\n  6 yo is like that too. He does not write because his letters are not perfect (I&#39;m<br/>\n  not pushing him) and he does not draw for the same reason. But what I have figured<br/>\n  out is that this is part of his learning style...basically he waits and watches and<br/>\n  when he is good and ready he does it overnight. He does this with most things...he<br/>\n  learns by watching. Even with computer games (which have been a great way for him to<br/>\n  learn that he does get better as time goes on), if it is too hard, his dad or I will<br/>\n  play it so he can watch.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Probably not much help, but it does seem like you hitting your head against a brick wall.<br/>\n  Can you look at another approach...maybe you could sit down and do the worksheets while<br/>\n  he watches (don&#39;t &quot;teach him&quot; but rather just think out loud while doing it), use real <br/>\n  world examples etc. Or just wait. There was a woman on our local hsing list whose<br/>\n  son was having a devil of a time doing long division. He could do it in his head, just<br/>\n  could not write it out on paper. She figured that was good enough and backed off. A year<br/>\n  later, he came and asked her to show him how to do long division. She explained it and<br/>\n  in 15 mins he got it perfectly. Maybe just explain to him that he is not ready to &quot;get it&quot;<br/>\n  now and it has nothing to do with him  being stupid or you not teaching him. That lots<br/>\n  of friends in school don&#39;t get it either. That just because he does not get it now, does<br/>\n  not mean that he will never get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of the things that I hope that my kids learn by being unschooled is that they can never be<br/>\n  stupid. If they don&#39;t know something it is just because they have not learned it yet. <br/>\n  School teaches that there are certain things that you are supposed to know by a certain age<br/>\n  and if you don&#39;t know it or get it then you are stupid. What baloney.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, something else just came to me...if he wants to go to school for the social aspect, <br/>\n  does it matter what his math grade is? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Stephanie E.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

If I remember correctly,<br/>\nhe said that if a kid came to a sticking point in math, the best way to get them<br/>\nbeyond it was to move forward. Go on to the higher math and when they see the concept<br/>\nbeing used, they will more easily understand it. Not sure if I am explaining it well, he <br/>\ndid a much better job! I can&#39;t seem to find my issue though...<br/>\n<br/>\nI can empathize with you on the stopping if he does not get it on the first try. My <br/>\n6 yo is like that too. He does not write because his letters are not perfect (I&#39;m<br/>\nnot pushing him) and he does not draw for the same reason. But what I have figured<br/>\nout is that this is part of his learning style...basically he waits and watches and<br/>\nwhen he is good and ready he does it overnight. He does this with most things...he<br/>\nlearns by watching. Even with computer games (which have been a great way for him to<br/>\nlearn that he does get better as time goes on), if it is too hard, his dad or I will<br/>\nplay it so he can watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably not much help, but it does seem like you hitting your head against a brick wall.<br/>\nCan you look at another approach...maybe you could sit down and do the worksheets while<br/>\nhe watches (don&#39;t &quot;teach him&quot; but rather just think out loud while doing it), use real <br/>\nworld examples etc. Or just wait. There was a woman on our local hsing list whose<br/>\nson was having a devil of a time doing long division. He could do it in his head, just<br/>\ncould not write it out on paper. She figured that was good enough and backed off. A year<br/>\nlater, he came and asked her to show him how to do long division. She explained it and<br/>\nin 15 mins he got it perfectly. Maybe just explain to him that he is not ready to &quot;get it&quot;<br/>\nnow and it has nothing to do with him  being stupid or you not teaching him. That lots<br/>\nof friends in school don&#39;t get it either. That just because he does not get it now, does<br/>\nnot mean that he will never get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I hope that my kids learn by being unschooled is that they can never be<br/>\nstupid. If they don&#39;t know something it is just because they have not learned it yet. <br/>\nSchool teaches that there are certain things that you are supposed to know by a certain age<br/>\nand if you don&#39;t know it or get it then you are stupid.

Just a &quot;drive-by&quot; comment, as it were, when I *ought* to be <br/>\nworking  {smile}.  I&#39;ve been hearing this sort of thing a lot recently <br/>\nabout kids blaming their moms for not teaching them or forcing them to <br/>\nlearn something or taking them out of school and ruining their <br/>\nlives.  There are two things that occur to me.  First, it might be good for <br/>\nson to understand that there are countless folks who have gone all the way <br/>\nthrough school, including college, and never learned or grasped an awful <br/>\nlot of the subject material they were exposed to, fractions chief among <br/>\nthem!  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re already quite aware of this, but sometimes it&#39;s good <br/>\nto be reminded.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, it may be good for you to remember (so you don&#39;t beat yourself up <br/>\ntoo much) that it&#39;s some small comfort for us to have someone to point the <br/>\nfinger at when we feel things aren&#39;t going so well, whether it&#39;s true or <br/>\nnot.  I had this dentist one time who was going to do a great deal of work <br/>\nin my mouth, and I knew I&#39;d be hurting later.  When he saw me in the <br/>\nwaiting area, he called out to me in a friendly way, &quot;Hi, how&#39;re you <br/>\ndoing?&quot;  I called back, &quot;Fine!  But I guess you&#39;ll see to that.&quot;  That was <br/>\na pretty dark response that I had.  It certainly wasn&#39;t his fault that my <br/>\nmouth was in the shape it was.  Anyway, I felt badly that I had said <br/>\nthat.  But, when I got into the chair a little later, he said that he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mind my saying it.  In fact, he said that if it helped me in some <br/>\nsmall way to feel a little better about my predicament, he was glad I had <br/>\nsaid it (of course, that made me feel worse!).  I had quite a while to sit <br/>\nin that chair and think about what he had said and how generous he was to <br/>\nabsorb my bad feelings in the hopes it would help me in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think if a dentist can do that for a relative stranger, can&#39;t I <br/>\ndo that for my kid?  Sometimes, it helps my son to have me as a &quot;whipping <br/>\nboy&quot; (sorry about that nasty term, but I can&#39;t think of another on short <br/>\nnotice) where he can deflect his negative feelings about himself onto <br/>\nme.  I&#39;m strong and I can take it.  I don&#39;t know for sure, but I hope it <br/>\nhelps him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think (not scientifically at all, just a guess really) that when <br/>\nsome kids reach those teenage years, they need to start the separation <br/>\nprocess from their folks, and it can get a little contrary and ugly.  It <br/>\nmay be part of a rite of passage.  There are lots of kids that I know who <br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to need to do this, but I&#39;m guessing that this could be *part* <br/>\nof the reason for some of that antagonistic stuff that goes on at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s three things, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there&#39;s my post for the month!

We started using Saxon in September.  We took a break in November and went back to it this week after re-evaluating whether or not he still wants to go back to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says he &quot;doesn&#39;t know&quot;.  Knowing him as I do, he means that he wants to but doesn&#39;t know if he can handle the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts like a vicious circle.  He says he wants to, I try to help, he gets frustrated and wants to quit, he abandons his real desire to go back to school (blaming me and also saying he is too stupid), and I let it go in order not to reinforce a bad experience.  Then a little while later, he wants to go to school, and the whole thing starts over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he really wants to go, and he really wants to learn this stuff, but he wants it to be so easy that he won&#39;t have to work at it.  The reality is, if he wants to be competent he&#39;s going to have to work at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight there is where the problem is I think.  A combination of his *want* to know and his misperception that it should be easy just because he wants it.  I don&#39;t know how to help him overcome that misperception and accept that its OK to have to work at something to be good at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that &quot;school at home&quot; (even in one subject), and &quot;going to school&quot; are not unschooling, but I don&#39;t understand how its not unschooling if this is something that is his choosing and I&#39;m facilitating what he wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132394532,"authorName":"Have a Nice Day!","from":"Have a Nice Day! &lt;litlrooh@...&gt;","profile":"litlrooh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] When to push?","postDate":"1044506251","msgId":58017,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMyY2Q5OSQ3NjQzZjI1MCRiNTU3NTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+","referencesHeader":"PDZiLjkxNzZiZDUuMmI3MzIyOTFAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDAwMzYwMWMyY2Q5MCQ3ZjBjOTE3MCRiNTU3NTI0NEBjZWxlcm9uMTc+IDwzRTQxREU3Mi5ENzM4MEU2MEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8MDAwNDAxYzJjZDk4JGVlZTVkZDAwJGI1NTc1MjQ0QGNlbGVyb24xNz4="},"prevInTopic":58016,"nextInTopic":58018,"prevInTime":58016,"nextInTime":58018,"topicId":57997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"By the way, my son also says that he should have stayed in school because then he would have learned all this stuff.

He wants to go to college and algebra and geometry both use a great deal of fraction and division applications, especially conversions. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  -=-Now he says &quot;forget it, I just won&#39;t go back to school&quot; and says he is <br/>\n  &quot;stupid&quot;.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;If unschooling were working happily at your home why would he want to go to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  school? &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because he misses his public school friends and is enticed by all the high school social stuff that happens: dances, clubs, sports, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt; Can&#39;t you just drop the Saxon stuff, drop pressing to prepare him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  for school (none of that is unschooling) and help him see that he is NOT <br/>\n  stupid? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Saxon was HIS suggestion, something he CHOSE.  He wanted to do it. How is that not unschooling?  And he was very happy doing it UNTIL he got to something he couldn&#39;t do easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is it unschooling to let someone abandon his dreams because he thinks he is terminally incompetent?  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Does that show respect for the child and his dreams? <br/>\n<br/>\n  Might that lead him to believe that I *agree* with his self assessment of being &quot;stupid&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Or is it unschooling to believe in that child and help that child *become* competent in an area that he *wants* to be competent in, so that he can pursue his dreams?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">    &gt;&gt;Do things he likes, that he&#39;ll enjoy, from which he&#39;ll learn, and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  you&#39;ll learn.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That *is* what we do.  But its not enough because his friends are in school. He wants to be with them and he wants to go back to school knowing he can be successful in school. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The things he enjoys have not helped him to learn the language of arithmetic or fractions.  He does not want to go back to school worrying that he&#39;ll fail in front of his friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt; He is letting his difficulty with arithmetic stop him from doing something <br/>\n  he really wants to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;You told him he needed to know it to go to school.  Why do you say HE is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  letting it stop him?&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I told him (and his friends confirmed) that in order to be prepared, he should know how to do basic arithmetic:  adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, fractions, decimals, percentages, and ratios.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;YOU made the &quot;requirement.&quot;   Why were you convinced he really needed that?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Because in 9th grade, he will be expected to know how to do basic arithmetic.   I&#39;m not comfortable sending him to 9th grade when he can barely do 4th grade level work.  That is setting him up to fail.  *HIS* solution was to work through Saxon 7/6.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; And I want him to have the option of going back to school without feeling <br/>\n  any more foolish than he already thinks he is.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;How old his he?
