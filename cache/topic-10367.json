I got the cold that the kids had and I have been miserably sick and have no energy for thinking.  By the way, sorry to have not answered anyone who asked me about scanning photos.  I got sick just at that point and was offline a few days.  AS you can imagine, I had quite a lot of mail to go through, and I am not done yet.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, thanks to everyone for the comments on the photo that I posted.  She is not our daughter, but we hope that she might be.  She is one of the children that we are being considered for as adoptive parents.  I know most of you know this, but it seemed that there was some confusion about it, so I thought I would clarify.  I pulled the picture directly off of a weblisting of children available for adoption.  I did not scan it.  SO I am not a paragon of knowledge for how to make scanners work.  In fact I got one for my birthday last year and am still figuring our how to make it work.  Sorry!<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10251,"nextTopicId":10370}}
