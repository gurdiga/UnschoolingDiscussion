They wanted to be teachers, and for a <br/>\nwhile two of them were. But they also played music -- a pair were in a band called <br/>\nthe Cockroaches -- and what they learned in college about the  3-year-old <br/>\nbrain they began to apply to their songwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not just that they know less, they think quite differently,&quot; says <br/>\nMurray Cook, who chatted for a couple minutes in  MCI Center&#39;s press room before <br/>\nthe show on Monday. &quot;You really have to focus on them more, because they&#39;re <br/>\nreally egocentric. The world revolves around them, so a lot of the stuff we do is <br/>\nto empower them. A lot of it is interactive, songs that have things for them <br/>\nto do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCook, who is well over  6 feet 4 inches takes the Wiggles seriously without <br/>\nseeming humorless or deadly earnest. He and his band mates -- yes, they play <br/>\ninstruments -- can do corny without irony, and they all appear genuinely amused <br/>\nby the antics of their audience, which is why their act never seems at all <br/>\ncreepy. Cook, for one, enjoys being a celebrity to people who think he lives in <br/>\nthe television, or don&#39;t understand what perspiration is.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When I go out into the audience, usually the kids just say things like &#39;Why <br/>\nare you wet?&#39; Once a kid said to me, &#39;You&#39;re melting!&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":85618,"nextTopicId":85609}}
