It happens in late  May <br/>\nevery year, in England.  Holly got to go this year.<br/>\n <br/>\nI got two e-mails yesterday from people who had photos online of  this.  I <br/>\nhad received a note to a blog about another dad&#39;s photos.   Now I&#39;ve put those <br/>\nlinks in one place, so if anyone wants to look at photos of a  wild week-long <br/>\nhome educators&#39; blowout in SE England, there they are.<br/>\n <br/>\nAND if anyone has photos online and would be willing to send me a link,  <br/>\nHolly will be thrilled to have more and more photos to remember what  to  date has <br/>\nprobably been the best thing in her whole life.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106500,"nextTopicId":106248}}
