(DH has a really great key<br/>\n&gt; lime pie.)  I was letting the kids (7 & 4) help but they were into it more<br/>\n&gt; than I needed.  First we made the graham cracker crust (DH wanted to buy the<br/>\n&gt; premade).  They had a blast.  DH was surprised to see them having so much<br/>\n&gt; fun.  DH was busy getting the chicken in marinate & the kids were under foot<br/>\n&gt; trying to help him too.  They had to read & follow directions for me.  I was<br/>\n&gt; planning on one key lime & one pumpkin.  DD & I cooked some down from last<br/>\n&gt; year&#39;s pumpkin & I froze it in cup sizes.  DH decided pumpkin was not in<br/>\n&gt; season so we&#39;re having 2 key lime pies.  Then I got out the bread dough.<br/>\n&gt; The kids were surprised at how it grew.  They wanted to eat the dough more<br/>\n&gt; than knead.  The first loaf is out of the oven & smells great.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DH decided he&#39;s figured out why husbands go to work & stay out of the<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling way.  The kids were trying to be too much help for him in a<br/>\n&gt; small kitchen.  Though he&#39;s gradually getting used to it.  It&#39;s the first<br/>\n&gt; time he&#39;s been home for a major bake off.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12561,"nextTopicId":12518}}
