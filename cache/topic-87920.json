My senior year of <br/>\ncollege I had an internship at the botanical gardens in Sarasota, FL- it was <br/>\nbeautiful!!!!<br/>\nMy husband is from upstate NY and that&#39;s where we are and will stay it looks <br/>\nlike...unless we move to Vt which he is interested in as well.  My dad was in <br/>\nthe Air Force and we lived all over.  I do miss swimming in the pool on xmas <br/>\nday!<br/>\nBut oh, the warm weather would be nice!!!!   Hope you are enjoying it because <br/>\nI would really love to take the kids for a nice walk to the park in shorts.   <br/>\nWell, we could but it might be a bit chilly!
