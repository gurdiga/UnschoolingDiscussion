I have<br/>\nalmost hoped people in the grocery store would ask my kids why they weren&#39;t<br/>\nin school, so I could tell them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I did wonder what my neighbors would think, but no one has said anything<br/>\nso far.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are also lucky because we live in Florida.  There are always so many<br/>\npeople who have taken their kids out of school for a week to vacaction, that<br/>\nnobody questions kids running around on school days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But, the sad fact is that most people don&#39;t understand homeschooling, or<br/>\nthat others feel strongly enough to do it.  I remember a family who lived<br/>\nnear my MIL in Michigan.  She said that one of the kids had been kicked out<br/>\nof school, so they had taken all their kids out and were homeschooling them.<br/>\nMIL said that they weren&#39;t even doing homeschool, because she saw the kids<br/>\noutside playing almost all day.  At the time, I agreed with her.  Now that I<br/>\nunderstand school and learning, it&#39;s my kids who are playing outside all<br/>\nday!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right before I started homeschooling I was in Hallmark and there was a<br/>\nlady there with several middle school aged kids and there was &quot;just<br/>\nsomething about them&quot;.  They seemed very self confident and happy and it<br/>\nreally made me wonder.

I have been to your web site it is fantastic and have enjoyed reading your wonderful journal. I did sign your guest book. Please don&#39;t stop it is a masterpeice IMHO. (It is good enough to publish in a book). Last year I know I had my kids in FL visiting with my Dad during school week and not during vacation time. It was great I didn&#39;t think about us being the only ones there with school age kids. One big reason I want to hs is because of the flexibility you can go to places wherever and whenever you want to. The person who I spoke to is not a true unschooler perhaps she still has one foot right in the door of propriety?New Englanders are big on that and are responsible for IS I believe it originated in Mass. I live here but am a New Yorker flamboyant at heart! Anyway I&#39;d love to meet you all when we do go down there some time next year.

When I saw her pulling out of the parking lot, she had a bumper sticker that said &quot;When it comes to school, there&#39;s no place like home&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine That!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy Wright<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wright Way To Homeschool<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/fl3/homeschoolingwrights\">http://www.angelfire.com/fl3/homeschoolingwrights</a><br/>\nemail:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:deejay@...\">deejay@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Beth Burnham","from":"&quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;beth2002@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"9Kr0hACtxhepJyqVpo1LBfjHUlNe3LliPxMyxJSPeRKzwn4UqJpzmKMxoSfquD1P8kCcenqm0_UNN2IQJMLIFD7bCN5hlqe7Nw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Being open about unschooling/homeschooling","postDate":"948960463","msgId":5837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zODQuNTgzNy45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5843,"prevInTime":5836,"nextInTime":5838,"topicId":5837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I recently spoke to a hs mom in charge of coordinating hs groups up here she said the local groups or families in NH don t like to be open when out and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2132159388\">Hi all,<br/>\nI recently spoke to a hs mom in charge of coordinating hs groups up here she said the local groups or families in NH don&#39;t like to be open when out and about with their kids esp. during school hours and also that they don&#39;t generally like to take them shopping during those times etc.because they want to avoid harassment.
