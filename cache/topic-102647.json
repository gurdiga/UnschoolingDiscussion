It&#39;s <br/>\nvery antagonistic - almost as if he&#39;s *looking* for a reason  to get mad.=&#92;=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n <br/>\nPeople with a high level of frustration or free-floating anxiety DO look  for <br/>\nother things to blame it on.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Question: If I try to avert possibly volatile situations and tip-toe  <br/>\naround <br/>\nhim, will he learn to handle frustration? -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nAbsolutely.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy  mother in law told us once that we needed to frustrate our  children so <br/>\nthey would learn to deal with frustration.   She&#39;s plenty  of frustration for <br/>\nus all. &lt;bwg&gt;  There are real frustrations.   No sense welcoming more.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- Or will he just learn that Mommy <br/>\nwill &quot;make everything ok?&quot;  Example:  He knows that I know the *right* way <br/>\nto cut/prepare his food.  So when Dad has to make his food, he lashes out <br/>\nand insists Mommy has to do  it.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nTell dad the right way, or do it yourself until he&#39;s older.<br/>\nHe&#39;ll get over it.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut the self-image of himself as a lashing-out kid, and your responses to  <br/>\nit, and the stories that will probably be told forevermore are harmful to  him.  <br/>\nHelp him be happy.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-Doesn&#39;t he need to learn that he can not *always* be the center of  <br/>\nattention?-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nHe is the center of his universe.<br/>\nIs.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you draw him close to the center of yours, it might help.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was a firstborn and I resented my sister&#39;s coming BIGTIME.  My  mother <br/>\nmishandled it in the extreme.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-I mean, my husband and I can&#39;t hold all our conversations until <br/>\nhe  goes to bed in hopes that this will head off an outburst.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nNot for 15 more years you can&#39;t, but for a few months you  can.<br/>\n <br/>\nFIRST see to him.  While he&#39;s fed, comfortable, and has been heard,  THEN <br/>\nhave your conversation. Maybe try to include him.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband used to start TOTALLY adult conversations in the car when there  <br/>\nwas a kid or two there.  I finally explained to him how shut out then and  <br/>\nbored the kids get, and how we&#39;re not together anymore once the kids zone out  <br/>\nbecause he&#39;s talking about refinancing the mortgage or something.    <br/>\nConversations that can&#39;t involve kids probably should take place in their  absence.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102636,"nextTopicId":18130}}
