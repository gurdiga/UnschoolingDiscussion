Other than that, I would read to him <br/>\na lot.

Early pre-reading cloth or board <br/>\nbooks are good.  Animals are cool -- seeing even our little guinea pig up <br/>\nclose has been better than just reading about it.  Blocks and play-doh and <br/>\nanything to build with -- save paper towel rolls and scrap paper -- these <br/>\nmake great paper airplanes and towers on castles, etc.  Water play is always <br/>\na good one at this age -- what floats, what sinks, how to blow bubbles, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a fun age where just about anything has some &quot;educational&quot; value.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"BintHanson@xxx.xxx","from":"BintHanson@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"KQPmqNzAWpATBqnCB4g0_f7w02lwUgzMUBFkSewYDEFKcXZxGmXDAqfFPTfYAevvnF18iyFyoY_X","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: the little ones","postDate":"947356122","msgId":5540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNjUuNTU0MC45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5539,"nextInTopic":5542,"prevInTime":5539,"nextInTime":5541,"topicId":5539,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Eileen, and everyone else...

I read to my daughter <br/>\n(almost) every day...but pretty much at this age it is just play, play, play. <br/>\n Not that one would want to have one&#39;s child in preschool - but if I am not <br/>\nwrong play is what happens there, too, except with probably some forced arts <br/>\nand crafts type stuff (i.e., color the snow man white, now color the sky <br/>\nblue, now make the tree green) etc.  :^P Boring! My child is just now (over <br/>\nthe last 6 months or so) getting really interested in learning how to read <br/>\nand write so I just sort of go with it and reinforce what she naturally wants <br/>\nto do.  She will tell me stuff like &quot;P makes a &quot;puh&quot; sound&quot; and then we will <br/>\nhave a conversation about it.  I have found that if I insist that we sit down <br/>\nand do something she doesn&#39;t enjoy it - hence the unschooling approach.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Fatimah<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BintHanson@...\">BintHanson@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"jazballard@xxx.xxx","from":"jazballard@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nS3tqLQyIGiz5T1SuzciXfXIzBwMmhdVA1jUZwfTUF-kfBresXG5lL7qvlirqCh_Dyw_zb-HyxXy","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"the little ones","postDate":"947354793","msgId":5539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zNjUuNTUzOS45NTkyNjk3NDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5540,"prevInTime":5538,"nextInTime":5540,"topicId":5539,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This request goes out to all of you..I am planning on unschooling my son (3yo) and would just like to have a starting point..i guess..everyone out there seems","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1500827736\">This request goes out to all of you..I am planning <br/>\non unschooling my son (3yo) and would just like <br/>\nto have a starting point..i guess..everyone out <br/>\nthere seems to have children of school age..and i <br/>\nwould just like to know about the toddler stage..<br/>\nthis is all sooo new anyway..as everyone expects<br/>\nme to be interviewing preschools now...so...any<br/>\nwords of wisdom from the seasoned masses would be<br/>\ngreatly appreciated..basically we play all day, run<br/>\nerrands, do swim and gym, trying out our first <br/>\nmoms and tots group this week...i&#39;d just like to <br/>\nhear about the early years from someone..<br/>\nthank you...<br/>\neileen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5529,"nextTopicId":5561}}
