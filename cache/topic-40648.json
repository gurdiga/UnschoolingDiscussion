She can&#39;t resist. Now she wants us all to think I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking about because she guesses I was never in band. She seems to need me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does being in band have to do with knowing how schools scam us? It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. Band instruments was merely an example. Next time, it&#39;ll be shoes<br/>\nfor the bowling team.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe public school mentality is Entitlement. Everyone is entitled to spend<br/>\nother people&#39;s money for every need they can imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my town, about 85% of the school budget pays for employees salaries and<br/>\nbenefits. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe budget pays for one employee for every six students. Are none of those<br/>\n&quot;extras&quot;? There are at least twice as many employees in my town&#39;s public<br/>\nschools as are needed, making them cost more than twice what the average<br/>\nprivate school charges in tuition. Extras, like &quot;deans,&quot; lunchroom monitors,<br/>\npolice in the corridors, special ed for fifteen percent of the children<br/>\nmostly because they weren&#39;t taught to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow &#39;bout psychological profilers and other mind-snoopers? How bout<br/>\npsychological testing that schools pay bundles for (to the Lutheran Church<br/>\nthink tank called The Search Institute, in Minneapolis) and don&#39;t tell<br/>\nparents about until after they&#39;re administered and keep the purpose and the<br/>\nresults secret. How bout all the standardized testing that&#39;s done, often<br/>\nagainst parents&#39;s wishes. Those few examples are &quot;extras&quot; that the schools<br/>\nprovide within the bloated budgets. If only ONE unnecessary employee were<br/>\neliminated, out of dozens of them that should, or one unnecessary set of<br/>\ntests, there would be money to burn for &quot;extras.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, since Sandra missed my point, the children plying the streets for money<br/>\nis not really for money -- schools already have far too much -- it&#39;s to keep<br/>\nthe entire community FEELING that the schools need more. It&#39;s PR,<br/>\n&quot;See, we absolutely have to send your children out into the neighborhoods<br/>\ndoor to door begging because YOU taxpayers don&#39;t give us enough. Sending the<br/>\nchildren into the streets, endangering them, forcing them to beg from<br/>\nstrangers, is stricly a public relations scam. The kids are used.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years back, my town&#39;s voters went to the polls to vote on whether or<br/>\nnot to accept the school budget for the next year. The town knew that the<br/>\nbudget was inflated as usual, and they voted it down. The superintendent&#39;s<br/>\nresponse was not to eliminate the fluff in the spending, but instead, he<br/>\nchose to eliminate the band for the following year. It eliminated ONE<br/>\nsalary, a pittance compared to the entire cut that was made and finally<br/>\naccepted. But the effect was to make the cuts hurt the children who loved<br/>\nplaying music, and the whole town who enjoyed the playing of the band at<br/>\ngames and in the annual parade. The measure could only be described as a<br/>\nmean trick by the superintendent because it forced him to accept a more<br/>\nappropriate amount of money to run the schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe long term effect was to hold the town hostage to his budgets ever since.<br/>\nNo one dares to challenge anything about school funding for fear that it<br/>\nwill be taken out on the kids. The system works well. Coercion is a great<br/>\ntool when you have the power to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nUnschooling is everything that school isn&#39;t.<br/>\nAll we need to do is make a list of what schools do, and do the opposite.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40619,"nextTopicId":40704}}
