The public schools? Hang in there - breathe deep. You&#39;re <br/>\non the right track - get the poor kid OUT of institutions and with his loving <br/>\nfamily. Don&#39;t make him feel like he&#39;s a &quot;patient&quot; or a &quot;victim&quot; if you can <br/>\npossibly help it - that doesn&#39;t do him any good. Surely you&#39;ve read &quot;The Gift <br/>\nof Dyslexia&quot; right? Do that first. Then - don&#39;t make his learning other stuff <br/>\ndependent on reading -- get into movies and books on tape and real-life <br/>\nexperiences, etc. Base life on his strengths - stop basing things on his <br/>\nweaknesses. Let him heal. Let him grow strong and confident.
