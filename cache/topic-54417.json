I don&#39;t believe that illicit sex, foul<br/>\nlanguage, violence, or indoctrination are a benefit to them. But, I am<br/>\nnot a hypocrite. I personally don&#39;t believe that they are a benefit to<br/>\nanybody, so a movie of that nature is rarely, if ever, brought into my<br/>\nhouse. This being so, the chances of them being subjected to them are<br/>\npretty slim. When they do perchance come across something I consider<br/>\nquestionable, we talk about why I choose not to have it on television.<br/>\nFor instance, if there is a political debate on, I tell them that<br/>\npoliticians tell an awful lot of lies, and that I choose not to listen to<br/>\nlies. When they are old enough (meaning having more life experience) and<br/>\ncan discern the truth from the lies, they will be free to watch at their<br/>\nwhim. I feel that illicit sex can  desensitize a child to what a<br/>\nmeaningful, healthy relationship between life partners should really be<br/>\nabout, and IMO can lead to promiscuity. But I do think that what my<br/>\nchildren see in my husband&#39;s and my own relationship will have more of an<br/>\nimpact than the occasional scene they may come across while switching<br/>\nchannels or what have you. Once, my 5dd saw an open mouthed kiss between<br/>\na couple. She asked, &quot;Mom, are they really kissing with their mouths<br/>\nopen?&quot; I told her yes they were. She replied, &quot;Don&#39;t they know they can<br/>\nget germs that way?&quot;<br/>\nNo more explaining was needed. She just thought they should know better. <br/>\nWende<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54416,"nextTopicId":54422}}
