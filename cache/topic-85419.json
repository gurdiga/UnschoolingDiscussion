Until that point, it&#39;s the giver&#39;s to do with as they <br/>\nlike.  Put it under the tree.  Hang it from the ceiling. Tie it to the <br/>\ndog.  Whatever.  If the giver wants to give it early, then it can be opened <br/>\nearly. If the giver hasn&#39;t given it yet, then it shouldn&#39;t be opened.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****longish story, feel free to skip *******<br/>\nI&#39;d had a big problem with my (9/10yo+) kids guessing what I&#39;d gotten for <br/>\nthem and put under the tree.  (Problem for ME (and the hubby), &#39;cause I was <br/>\ndisappointed in not being able to surprise them.)  They&#39;d go so far as to <br/>\npartly unwrap things, and tear corners of packages to get a clue then <br/>\nthey&#39;d grin real big and with great satisfaction in their intellectual <br/>\nprowess, tell me really loudly that they already knew what I was going to <br/>\ngive and that I couldn&#39;t pull anything over on them! On Xmas day, they&#39;d be <br/>\nhanded a present, declare &quot;It&#39;s an XYZ.  I know already.&quot; sometimes without <br/>\neven opening it, and sometimes even go so far as to ignore it utterly while <br/>\nwaiting to open the &#39;supreme&#39;/heart-throb present that they&#39;d also figured <br/>\nout but which was still under the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis really bugged me, not only because it showed no regard for how the <br/>\ngiver felt, but also because it seemed that the focus was more on getting <br/>\nthe really cool present or showing how much cleverer the intended recipient <br/>\nwas at figuring out clues than the giver was at hiding them... rather than <br/>\non the fun of exchanging goodwill (in this case, by exchanging gifts with <br/>\neach other.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as I put out presents the next year, I sat down with them and explained <br/>\nhow when I give presents, part of what I like best is seeing the surprise <br/>\nand happiness on their faces as they open it on Christmas morning and <br/>\nfigure out what it is for the very first time.  I shared that when they <br/>\nalready knew what I was going to give them, that it ruined my joy in <br/>\nsurprising them and took all the fun out of it for me and it all made me <br/>\nfeel pretty lousy.  Then I suggested that if they insisted in figuring out <br/>\nthe gifts from ME, they had to make sure that I didn&#39;t realize it or the <br/>\ngift would change.<br/>\n<br/>\n From then on, they&#39;d shake things, but the tearing and unwrapping <br/>\nstopped.  They never once said they knew already and always looked <br/>\npleasantly surprised when opening them.  There was even a running joke that <br/>\nI was giving them an ironing board.  &quot;Hey mom, I&#39;ve figured this one <br/>\nout!  It&#39;s an ironing board, right?&quot;  Sometimes they&#39;d figure it out and <br/>\nadmit it to me a few weeks later, but they always respected my feelings <br/>\nabout Christmas day and being able to surprise them with the gifts that I gave.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids are likewise in charge of the presents they&#39;re giving.  If they <br/>\ndon&#39;t mind the recipient opening them before gift-day/Xmas, then they make <br/>\nit obvious and give it early.  Sometimes they open each other&#39;s gifts <br/>\nearly.  Usually though, they like to see them under the tree and to have it <br/>\nopened with the others, on the traditional day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n...and even though HeidiC *thinks* she might be more gorgeous than HeidiWD, <br/>\nHeidiWD is quite sure she&#39;s mistaken, although she&#39;s gotta be pretty gosh <br/>\ndarn good looking, considering her name and all...
