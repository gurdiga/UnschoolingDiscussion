Keith graduated<br/>\nwhen he was nearly 30 and had many fun adventures earlier&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s great that your husband was able to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still in college at 32 - (graduate school) and have taken courses of<br/>\ninterest here and there. My Dad especially stressed the importance of<br/>\neducation - and that I was brilliant and could do anything I wanted etc. -<br/>\nbut there were other issues and I did exactly what you were saying about the<br/>\nfleas jumping to the next dog. I left the day after high school<br/>\ngraduation -and was married a year later. I am still married (happily...)<br/>\nwith three children (luckily - the next dog was a really great one! - but<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t always happen). Sometimes I wonder if I would have done some<br/>\nother things - before getting married. I always wanted to travel a bit and<br/>\nwould have liked to figure out what I wanted out of life. I still don&#39;t<br/>\nreally know what I want to do when I &quot;grow up&quot; . However, this is case in<br/>\npoint of the school system - I came out high honors and top of the class -<br/>\nclueless as to what I really wanted to do with life. In college, I was sure<br/>\nI was going to work on Wall street - and then came to the conclusion that I<br/>\nreally dislike big cities and that whole atmosphere - and I much prefer the<br/>\ncountry. I think there are many people that follow the prescribed high<br/>\nschool/college/making money path and then find out that they didn&#39;t really<br/>\nwant to be a doctor, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the great thing for my kids is watching them develop their passions.<br/>\nMy daughter who loves cooking can spend hours watching cooking shows and<br/>\nthen she&#39;ll go in the kitchen and experiment with bread. I wasn&#39;t even<br/>\nallowed in the kitchen when I was her age (11). She is already a great baker<br/>\nand cook and won&#39;t have to wait until &quot;someday&quot; to become one - because she<br/>\ncan practice now. I know that if she chooses to go to college it will be<br/>\nbecause she wants to - and not because she thinks that&#39;s the next step - the<br/>\nonly option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will share this - my parents put so much emphasis on going to school - and<br/>\ncollege being the whole way to make you happy and successful - that I had a<br/>\nhuge guilt feeling that I couldn&#39;t do anything worthwhile without the piece<br/>\nof paper. Well, now I have the piece of paper - and really I am the same<br/>\nperson I was before - and am still waiting for the genius to set it!(just<br/>\nkidding) It was talked about like it was the magic spell of security and<br/>\nthat if only you had that degree you can do anything. I have found that it<br/>\nsimply isn&#39;t true - that in some cases it will open doors - but what matters<br/>\nmore is doing whatever it is that you love - and being able to get in there<br/>\nand muck around in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Vent --- just need to vent!/expectation to grow up","postDate":"1134056481","msgId":110579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEExNTc1RDRELTQxREEtNDlDMy04QjQyLTFDRDNEQkQxRTdBMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjA4MTQxNzUxLjYyMDAxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUxMjA4MTQxNzUxLjYyMDAxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110578,"nextInTopic":110582,"prevInTime":110578,"nextInTime":110580,"topicId":110528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ================= What a perfect way to look at it.

So to protect  <br/>\nthemselves they have to assume you&#39;re a fruitcake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to give out what people want to hear. Not lie to them. I just  <br/>\ndon&#39;t rock their boats unless they&#39;re asking questions that let me  <br/>\nknow they&#39;re interested in rocking ;-) To the grade question I&#39;ll  <br/>\nanswer &quot;She&#39;s homeschooled but she&#39;d be in 9th grade.&quot; And I don&#39;t  <br/>\nsay unschooling, just that her learning is based around her interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see their children, I have been to their homes, their children swear<br/>\n&gt; and talk back,  and it is looked at as funny --- (thank you &quot;The<br/>\n&gt; Simpsons&quot; and the like)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Simpson&#39;s doesn&#39;t cause swearing. We watch Simpsons and we don&#39;t swear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat causes disrespectful kids (which might be expressed by swearing)  <br/>\nis being treated with disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids and some families use swear words because they&#39;re just  <br/>\nwords to them. Different values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an important distinction if you want to see clearly causes  <br/>\nand effects between swearing and being disrespectful. Not the same  <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they watch movies that I, as an adult, would<br/>\n&gt; not watch.(r rated!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter has watched some movies and TV shows I wouldn&#39;t watch on  <br/>\nmy own either. They happen to be G and PG but the important part is  <br/>\nthat she has her own standards of what she likes, what satisfies her  <br/>\nneeds and I have mine. Lots overlap but much doesn&#39;t too. That&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling means giving them freedom (and support!) to explore the  <br/>\nworld. For some kids that freedom will be the ability to explore (R- <br/>\nrated) horror movies but kids aren&#39;t going to watch adult movies just  <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re given freedom. Why would they? Kids do pick and  <br/>\nchoose which kid movies they like and want to see. Why would they  <br/>\nwatch more adult movies indescriminately?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we divide the world between what they can and can&#39;t do/see, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnatural for them to want to do what they can&#39;t. When we say &quot;No, you  <br/>\ncan&#39;t do/watch that,&quot; we&#39;re saying we don&#39;t think they can handle  <br/>\nit.  It&#39;s like setting up a challenge for them. They *want* to prove  <br/>\nthey&#39;re competent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the world is divided between what they want to do and what they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do, there&#39;s no reason to choose what they don&#39;t want to  <br/>\ndo! Though my daughter has seen a couple of R rated movies but she  <br/>\nknows her personal limits on horror and has no  interest in sex so  <br/>\nthere&#39;s no reason for her to want to watch most R movies. Not because  <br/>\nthey&#39;re R but because they just don&#39;t interest her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could make her want to see them by telling her she can&#39;t though! Or  <br/>\nby telling her they&#39;re bad or junk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she does have the freedom to choose, since she knows I&#39;m on her  <br/>\nside in trying to find what *she* wants to see (and trying to avoid  <br/>\nwhat *she* doesn&#39;t want to see) she does trust me when I tell her  <br/>\nthere are scenes that she might not like. She knows I don&#39;t have an  <br/>\nulterior motive in trying to get her to see only quality, or get her  <br/>\nto hone her judgement so she&#39;ll only choose what I would choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd part of being a family is being exposed to what others like (what  <br/>\nothers think is &quot;quality&quot;) so she gets exposed to a lot she wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\ngrab off the shelf on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe that if you bring your children up knowing quality they will<br/>\n&gt; recognize &quot;ugly&quot; in an instant! So far that is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, what they learn to recognize is what the parents&#39; standards of  <br/>\nquality are. They learn &quot;This is what Mom thinks is good and this is  <br/>\nwhat Mom thinks is bad.&quot; But that doesn&#39;t give them an internal  <br/>\nbarometer to judge something new, especially if they aren&#39;t exposed  <br/>\nto bad! They only have a vague impression from some external  <br/>\nqualities of what constitutes &quot;bad&quot; without actually experiencing and  <br/>\ndeciding for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudgement comes from trying things out, not memorizing what others  <br/>\nthink is good and bad. Good (and quality) and bad are relative terms.  <br/>\nLots of people would judge a lot of what I watched and read when I  <br/>\nwas a child as &quot;bad&quot; (though now it&#39;s classic junk ;-) but it  <br/>\nsatisfied something I needed at the time that more &quot;quality&quot; shows  <br/>\nand books didn&#39;t meet.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Because* I had the freedom to choose what met my needs and what  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t meet them I was able to decide *for myself* what is quality  <br/>\n*for me*. I can see that Lost in Space isn&#39;t &quot;quality&quot; (even knew it  <br/>\nat the time). I can see that &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; are deeper but though I enjoyed them they didn&#39;t  <br/>\nsatisfy my needs at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needed to tell me what quality was. I figured it out for  <br/>\nmyself by watching what I liked, talking about what I liked and  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t, listening to others and exploring freely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to ask yourself what is &quot;quality&quot;? Is it decided by  <br/>\nexperts and everyone goes along? If so what relevance does it have if  <br/>\nsomeone doesn&#39;t like something deemed &quot;quality&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\nAnswers to common unschooling questions: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/\">http://home.earthlink.net/</a> <br/>\n~fetteroll/rejoycing/<br/>\nWeekly writing prompts: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingWriters-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247861255,"authorName":"homeschoolcrew6","from":"&quot;homeschoolcrew6&quot; &lt;homeschoolcrew6@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolcrew6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Vent --- just need to vent! - speaking of R rated movies","postDate":"1133972324","msgId":110552,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRuNzIxNCtxMm1kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERCMUQwRjZDLTFDQTAtNDg2RC05RkVELTUxRTVCRUI0QkNEMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":110551,"nextInTopic":110553,"prevInTime":110551,"nextInTime":110553,"topicId":110528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra No not always....we dont always wake up on the wrong side of the bed and we dont ALL usually do it on the  same day.

One of the best things you can do<br/>\nfor yourself and your children is to let go of worrying about what other<br/>\npeople think, not just in unschooling, but in life.  Life is far too short<br/>\nto live it trying to win other peoples&#39; approval.<br/>\n<br/>\n********************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOh this is SOOOO hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I was just getting totally into unschooling last week and feeling totally confident (something I still struggle with) and I totally &quot;got it&quot; and then I hear other people talk and say stuff out of complete ignorance, and it just makes me question myself all over again, &quot;am I doing the right thing&quot;?  I&#39;m one of those persons who likes to keep all the options open...and I have to remind myself that with unschooling, all the options ARE open.  No door ever closes, ever.  The only difference is that learning is not on a schedule and the resources available are many more than just a textboook and a grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just reminded today that my son took a college course, but didn&#39;t do well (it was a remedial english).  He actually tested into the higher remedial class (which was a boon to us!!), but then proceeded to not do all of the assignments etc.  I realize that some of it was an organization problem, and some of it was a motivation problem.  I guess thats what upsets me the most...why did he take the class if he wasn&#39;t going to do the work?  He enjoyed the class, and he really thought he *was* getting stuff done, but at the same time he admitted he was cutting corners.  He was only 16 at the time, so maybe it was a maturity issue.   And the professor seemed to think he just didn&#39;t have enough &quot;experience material&quot; to write about.   It just makes me question everything.  Not enough material?  I really must have failed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, he learned other things from taking the class.  He learned that not all institutional learning is forced and unpleasant, such as it is at compulsary attendance schools.  He learned that he really likes college age friends.  And he loved being in class.  Everyone really loved his sense of humor.  It built his confidence that way, even if he didn&#39;t do well in the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, one year later, he has actually created an apprenticeship for himself by working with the next door neighbor doing siding etc.  It was through this neighbor that he also taught himself the drums, learned how to &quot;jam&quot; and goes on interesting field trips to watch &quot;trains&quot;, learned some photography, and aquired a nice camera.  And now, two of his other friends (who are in their late 20&#39;s, early 30&#39;s) are planning to start up an arcade kind of place with video games like for xbox and he is slated to be the av tech for the new place.  They even have the right connections to do it.  I hope it really happens for them, I&#39;m really excited about the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nOBVIOUSLY he is doing really well, and this lifestyle is really working for him.  And I&quot;m convinced that no other lifestyle would have come close to meeting his needs.  And yet, even he says from time to time that he should have stayed in school because he would have learned more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my youngest daughter has a friend who tells her she is going to grow up to be stupid because she isn&#39;t in school.  (Some friend! but my daughter likes to hang out with her, though less so since she started saying stuff like that).  This is the daughter who is only just reading more fluently this year, and the same one who likes to look through my college level Anatomy and Phyiology book...she&#39;s 10, and wants to be a doctor....but she still wonders if her friend is right sometimes.  Though, lately she has been saying that the problem is with the friend, not with our lifestyle.  Smart girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just struggle with confidence sometimes.  I loved reading about Sandra&#39;s son taking the math class at college.  It just cemented for me the whole idea that learning is available at any time.  There is no need to put it on a schedule.  Its just hard to &quot;be&quot; in a world where so many others don&#39;t understand that.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Vent --- just need to vent!","postDate":"1133963419","msgId":110545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkYy40YTRlM2E0ZS4zMGM4NDI5YkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":110542,"nextInTopic":110551,"prevInTime":110544,"nextInTime":110546,"topicId":110528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/7/2005 6:53:45 AM Central Standard Time, game-enthusiast@adelphia.net writes: When  some of my nieces and nephews were younger and used","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-148731348\">In a message dated 12/7/2005 6:53:45 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen  some of my nieces and nephews were younger and used  inappropriate<br/>\nlanguage/talk, I was very judgmental of their parents who had  allowed them<br/>\nto watch inappropriate TV shows etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd even those kids use swear words!
