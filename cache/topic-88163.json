If I am waiting <br/>\nfor a bus or subway I see the news kiosks selling candy and it&#39;s hard to resist. When I <br/>\nam at the grocery store I try not to, but sometimes I buy cookies or ice cream. Once <br/>\nthey are in my house, I can&#39;t eat just one or two bites like some people can. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe just through example or maybe through talks on nutritional<br/>\n&gt; value of food... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know what foods are nutritious, and I knew when I was a kid.

LUCKY. I would give anything to be one of those people who <br/>\ncan just have a few bites of cake and leave the rest. Who knows, maybe I would be <br/>\neven more overweight than I am if my mother had kept the house stocked with <br/>\nsweets. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy half-sister (on my dad&#39;s side) is allowed to eat whatever she wants whenever she <br/>\nwants and is quite chunky and obsessed with food. My stepmother is hoping that not <br/>\nrestricting her intake or making her feel self-conscious about it might help her not be <br/>\nso obsessed. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is only 9 and watches cooking shows (has been for years actually) and loves to <br/>\ncook. The amount of tasting she does when preparing a meal is positively comical. <br/>\nStir, lick, stir, lick LOL. She&#39;s very athletic, and healthy, but she&#39;s big for her age, and <br/>\nlooks chubby. She may have a struggle ahead of her to stay within a healthy range, <br/>\nshe may outgrow it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have an aunt on my father&#39;s side who was extremely obese (at least 300 pounds <br/>\nand only 5&#39;3&quot; or so). She&#39;s lost a lot of weight, but only after she turned 40 or so and <br/>\nshe&#39;s still above her optimal weight. So maybe it just runs in my family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to give my story so that people can weigh all of the different theories <br/>\nwhen it comes to food and kids.

If I was left alone, even for just a few minutes, I would sneak <br/>\nhoney, the only sweet thing available. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was old enough to get an allowance, I spent it all on candy and cookies and <br/>\nsnack cakes. I would come home from school (mom was still at work) and pig out on <br/>\njunk.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI started to have a weight problem when I was 11 or 12, around the same time that I <br/>\nstarted getting enough allowance to really go crazy on the junk food. I would buy a <br/>\nbox of cookies and hide it under my bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was also the time when I was given lunch money instead of a bag lunch. I would <br/>\ngo to the school cafeteria, buy coffee and cookies, and dunk the cookies in my light <br/>\nsweet coffee and that was lunch. Needless to say, I suffered from chronic headaches, <br/>\nand would sometimes be passed out on the couch when my mom came home from <br/>\nthe sugar crash.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been struggling with my weight ever since and I have a terrible sweet tooth. I <br/>\ncould eat cookies cake and ice cream all day long and it&#39;s very hard to control my <br/>\nimpulses. The only thing that helps is to eat a high-protein, moderate fat, low carb <br/>\ndiet. This helps even out my blood sugar and keeps the cravings at bay. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still have to fake out my sweet tooth with lots of artificial sweetener in my coffee, <br/>\nsugar-free jello and pudding, etc. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that healthy to consume so much <br/>\naspartame and Splenda, but I&#39;d be 300 pounds otherwise. As it is, I am about 50 <br/>\npounds overweight (20 of it is baby weight, but my baby is 7 months old!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure, but perhaps if sweets had been treated with more of a &quot;no big deal&quot; <br/>\nattiude (rather than as forbidden fruit) I might not have such a problem now. I could <br/>\nbe wrong. Just thought I&#39;d offer one perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88619,"nextTopicId":88643}}
