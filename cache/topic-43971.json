I wanted to share a piece from an article in the June issue of <br/>\nReader&#39;s Digest. The article is all about survival techniques you <br/>\nneed if you were to get lost in the woods.  I couldn&#39;t help but see <br/>\nthis from an unschooling frame of mind, if you know what I mean :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One great riddle of survival is why some people live while others, <br/>\noften facing less difficult conditions, die.  Surprisingly, Hill <br/>\nsays &quot;one of the highest survival rates is for children six and <br/>\nunder.&quot;<br/>\nThe reason may lie in some basic childhood traits: Small children do <br/>\nnot create complex mental maps; they don&#39;t run to get somewhere <br/>\nbeyond their field of vision.  They also follow their instincts.  If <br/>\nit gets cold, they&#39;ll crawl into a hollow tree to get warm.  If <br/>\nthey&#39;re thirsty, they drink.  Making themselves comfortable helps <br/>\nkeep them alive.<br/>\nChildren ages 7 to 12, on the other hand, behave much like adults: <br/>\nThey panic & run.  If the trail peters out, they keep going, ignoring <br/>\nthirst, hunger & cold, until they fall over.  they suppress the very <br/>\ninstincts that might help them to survive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that the &quot;school age&quot; children are the ones to <br/>\ndeny their instincts,hmmm...wonder why?<br/>\n<br/>\nCarla<br/>\n&quot;Tell me & I&#39;ll forget; Show me & I&#39;ll remember; Involve me & I&#39;ll <br/>\nunderstand&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43804,"nextTopicId":43868}}
