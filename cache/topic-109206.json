You are the<br/>\nparent, you have all the legal and practical responsibilities and you will<br/>\nmake the decisions on what approach to education makes sense for your son.<br/>\nTake the pressure off your son - and hurry!  Let him be the kid he is and<br/>\nreassure him that, no matter what grandma says about whether he should be in<br/>\nschool or not, she will not be making the decision.  You, as his nurturing,<br/>\ncaring mother, will.  You will help him to achieve whatever he wants,<br/>\nperiod.  That is what a mother does.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb Lundgren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109203,"nextTopicId":109207}}
