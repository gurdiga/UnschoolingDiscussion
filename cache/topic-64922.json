This can be related to all kinds of things - diet, <br/>\n  basic brain wiring, environmental influences, etc. There are all <br/>\n  kinds of things you can do to help him get his needs for sensory <br/>\n  input met. Do a Google serach on &quot;sensory integration&quot; and you&#39;ll <br/>\n  find a lot of information. I also like the book &quot;The Out-Of-Sync <br/>\n  Child&quot; (don&#39;t let the title throw you off), which completely <br/>\n  explains sensory integration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For my son, if he has dairy at all in any form, he gets extremely <br/>\n  sensory-seeking. He will literally run around the house crashing <br/>\n  into walls, people, furniture. It&#39;s like his body feels <br/>\n  disorganized, and the only way he can make it feel better is to have <br/>\n  serious sensory input. Obviously, he doesn&#39;t eat dairy anymore <br/>\n  unless he accidentally gets it. But he can become sensory-seeking in <br/>\n  a milder incarnation if he gets stressed or overtired or hungry or <br/>\n  is in a situation in which he feels nervous. Often he will come up <br/>\n  and bump or crash into me. Now that I&#39;ve recognized this for what it <br/>\n  is, I can offer him a deep squeezing hug as much as he needs, and <br/>\n  this really seems to help. I&#39;ll just ask &quot;Do you need a squeezy <br/>\n  hug?&quot; and usually he&#39;ll say yes. I think it was really important for <br/>\n  me to move beyond *reacting* to what he&#39;s doing and to be proactive <br/>\n  about helping him with what his body is needing at the time. Sensory-<br/>\n  seeking kids can have a very hard time being around smaller or more <br/>\n  fragile kids, because they sometimes are not able to effectively <br/>\n  limit how much contact their body gives out. Not sure if this is the <br/>\n  case with your kid, but thought I&#39;d throw this out in case it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Blue Skies,<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He will literally run around the house crashing <br/>\ninto walls, people, furniture. It&#39;s like his body feels <br/>\ndisorganized, and the only way he can make it feel better is to have <br/>\nserious sensory input.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you find this out by experimenting with his diet? My son is extremely high energy - and I have often thought it to do with sugar...  I never thought about dairy - any info you have that you would like to pass along would be appreciated ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also tends to be loud and plays rough. He is very active and doesn&#39;t sit still much (He&#39;s 5) which is ok - but at times it is hard doing things like going to the store - or church - or somewhere else where he needs to be quiet. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you know if this is just your child&#39;s &quot;personality&quot;? I have often thought if he was in school they would be saying &quot;Ritalin!!!&quot; for which I am thankful to have him home and able to go out and burn off his energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: the_clevengers <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, April 14, 2003 12:05 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: boys and playing/fighting<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rebecca DeLong <br/>\n  &lt;elfmama@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; I haven&#39;t tried walking away, I&#39;ve tried explaining that I don&#39;t <br/>\n  like being knocked down and I&#39;ve asked him to try and remember that. <br/>\n  I&#39;ll try walking away, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; This is something we&#39;ve been worried about, the fact that it&#39;s <br/>\n  extending to others, and not everybody likes to play as rough as him <br/>\n  and they will not want to play with him.
