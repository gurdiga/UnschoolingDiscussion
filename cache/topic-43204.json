I have seen kids around <br/>\nHolly&#39;s age do this a million times -- they understand a lot but don&#39;t always <br/>\nunderstand when getting the minute details correct isn&#39;t really all that <br/>\ngermaine to the point of relating the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve ALSO seen is how parents usually react to their kids doing it. They <br/>\nalmost always feel a bit embarrassed and like the kid was interrupting (not <br/>\nthinking of them as part of the conversation) and usually try to shush the <br/>\nkid or brush off the corrections or even sometimes tell the kid in one way or <br/>\nanother to just butt out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra turned to Holly and very seriously asked her to clarify what had <br/>\nexactly happened. Holly has a rather amazing memory for stuff like who said <br/>\nwhat and who said what next, etc., and she filled in that part of the story <br/>\nand then Sandra thanked her and continued it herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a small thing - but the level of respect Sandra gives her kids is <br/>\nreally beyond that which I&#39;ve seen just about anywhere else, especially when <br/>\nit comes to these very common kinds of interactions. And the payoff is very <br/>\nvery obvious. Holly is an easygoing delightful articulate and very very <br/>\ncourteous and kind kid. She looks you right in the eye, she&#39;s interested in <br/>\nwhat you have to say, and she&#39;s just amazingly insightful, especially about <br/>\nhuman behavior. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes wish, oddly, that I&#39;d had really lousy parenting myself -- so <br/>\nthat I&#39;d be less inclined to follow the &quot;pretty darn good&quot; patterns of my own <br/>\nmom, and be really aware and make very conscious decisions, like Sandra has <br/>\ndone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - my point is that Sandra is really talking about very very VERY <br/>\nrespectful parenting - not just kinda sorta - and I don&#39;t think that her <br/>\nkids, by the way, were genetically just &quot;easy.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42941,"nextTopicId":43205}}
