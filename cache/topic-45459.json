But point is, if I just live my life and not worry about fat or what I look like, I lose weight, hmmm.  I wish everyone could just love themselves and get over it!  That&#39;s why letting my children choose what to eat is sooo important to me and you know what, they are just fine!  <br/>\nGee who would uv thunk that we should eat when we are hungry and it might not be at the exact times as everyone else??  And its ok to eat chips sometimes and eat candy sometimes and chocolate, sometimes.<br/>\nMy big discovery in the last week or so is that I am craving less things since starting yoga.  Some one came over this weekend and he loves chocolate like I do and was complaining I didn&#39;t have any.  I had to stop and think, yeah, I guess I havn&#39;t bought any for a while??????????What&#39;s wrong with me or right with me?  <br/>\nI think maybe I&#39;ll be converting from Lutheranism to Budhism, what do you think?

Just stick to it and I do think that eventually when all is well <br/>\nand your husband sees that, he will have a change of heart. Just don&#39;t give <br/>\nhim a &quot;I told you so,&quot; they hate that!!!! (Sorry Todd!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know of other husbands of friends who have gone through the same thing. <br/>\nNot just with food stuff but with the whole unschooling way. When people see <br/>\nit working, they can&#39;t help but come to a better understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the picky kid thing, I have two here. Well actually more like one <br/>\nnow. My first daughter was raised totally different from the other 3, school <br/>\nand all the attachments. BUT, I was always rather unschooly in most of my <br/>\nthoughts. I never made her eat stuff she didn&#39;t want to or make her clean <br/>\nher plate or eat what and when I &#39;thought&#39; she should eat. She was an <br/>\nexcellent eater until she turned 2 years old. She totally cut out all meat <br/>\nfrom her diet on her own. No red meat or chicken or fish. Cut out most <br/>\nvegetables and fruits also. Loved the starches, pasta and potatoes and <br/>\nbreads. Ate her fair share of desserts but nothing major. She would eat <br/>\napples and corn and carrots, then it was all pasta and cereal and such. When <br/>\nshe started school, it was a big deal to find something she would take to <br/>\neat. I actually packed a thermos with garlic pasta in it for her. (the <br/>\nteachers loved that one!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCut to the chase, she&#39;s almost 17 now and you would never know she had been <br/>\nsuch a picky kid. First of all, even though she still goes to school, she <br/>\ngets sick less than we do. She&#39;s very healthy and now eats chicken and <br/>\nsteak, carrots, green beans, corn, grapes, etc. Point is she added to her <br/>\ndiet considerably on her own without any prompting from us. She can go out <br/>\nanywhere and eat without anyone knowing she could never ever do that before.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdded note here, our almost 8 year old son is doing the same thing. Started <br/>\nout eating everything in sight and gradually started to cut things out of <br/>\nhis diet. He lives on PB&J, pizza, hot dogs, cheese, pasta, cereal, corn, <br/>\ntortilla chips and sour cream!! He likes fast food chicken but not from <br/>\nhome. Go figure!! He&#39;s thin but not skinny and has more energy than all of <br/>\nus put together. Hardly ever sick and when he is, it&#39;s no big deal. I <br/>\nactually had blood taken from him when he was 4 as I started to worry so <br/>\nmuch about how he ate. After the Dr. said he was fine, my husband brought up <br/>\nthe oldest and how at that time, she just started to add more food to her <br/>\nmenu. She was already almost 13 then and that&#39;s when I realized I needed to <br/>\nstop worrying. She was fine and he was fine and what was the big deal. So I <br/>\nhad to feed him before we went out to dinner anywhere. So what???<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does work out eventually. Sometimes it may seem like it&#39;s taking forever, <br/>\nbut trust them to know what they need and want and it will be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur other 2 girls so far, eat everything put in front of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"&quot;Tia Leschke&quot; &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] We took the plunge...no more food restrictions....","postDate":"1033925020","msgId":45483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYzIwMWMyNmQ1ZiQ0MjNlNjAyMCQxZDdhNjZjZkBlYnVzNDk+","referencesHeader":"PDlENkNGOUNFQTc2ODNDNEQ4RjQxNUEzRjU0RDFDMDY2MDE0MTlDQTJAZHN0cDEuZGVsdGFzb2x1dGlvbnMuY29tPiA8MDA3ZDAxYzI2ZDNhJGY2YjNiYjYwJDAxM2ZmZWE5QGNvbXB1dGVyPg=="},"prevInTopic":45469,"nextInTopic":45489,"prevInTime":45482,"nextInTime":45484,"topicId":45459,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m trying to work on him for an unassisted homebirth next time, but that s the one thing he s stood firm about for 6 years now, so I may not be able to get","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1415054702\">I&#39;m trying to work on him for an unassisted homebirth next time, but that&#39;s<br/>\nthe one thing he&#39;s stood firm about for 6 years now, so I may not be able to<br/>\nget that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was at the unassisted homebirth of my third grandbaby in August.

LOL I was just telling him yesterday that it would be so much simpler if he&#39;d just agree to begin with! He was this way with unschooling, not taking the doctor&#39;s word about everything regarding the kids, not getting the two youngest all their vacs, having a midwife birth, breastfeeding (then breastfeeding til 1 and now he&#39;s agreed to age 3! LOL), and oh so many other things.
