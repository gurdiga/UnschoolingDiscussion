I know you can make a solar<br/>\npanel work with electric light because we tried it once with a little solar<br/>\npanel kit we got for him.  I know it wouldn&#39;t work the way he thinks it<br/>\nwould, like you can&#39;t really make a perpetual motion machine, but I can&#39;t<br/>\nput my finger on why.
