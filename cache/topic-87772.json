I&#39;m on digest and read when I can. I don&#39;t post often because I&#39;m<br/>\nusually behind so much someone has said what I wanted to already and that&#39;s<br/>\nok. I&#39;m just about caught up but I know I&#39;m not really because I haven&#39;t<br/>\ncollected mail all afternoon. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some great responces<br/>\nbefore this goes through but oh well...one more perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I find I absorb all the wonderful stuff just from reading it and<br/>\n_applying_ it to our lives. It really helps me and ultimately my boys to<br/>\nlurk and learn and really *be* with my boys. We&#39;ve come a long way. I am<br/>\nvery greatful to those that have come before me and share what they have<br/>\ndone in the past and how they live now. As you know it&#39;s a great list to<br/>\n*get* unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Try digest. If you don&#39;t like it read on the web when you can. If you<br/>\nlike individual post best, read only the subject lines that interest you. If<br/>\nyou have certain concerns post here or go to the message boards of<br/>\nunschooling.com and read. Lurk that&#39;s helpful too.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Keeping up isn&#39;t my priority anymore. Coming from this perfectionist<br/>\nthat&#39;s hard to admit. Learning and applying unschooling principles in our<br/>\nlives is what it&#39;s all about for me now. Try to sit back, relax and enjoy<br/>\nyour family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarb E<br/>\nWe worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he<br/>\nis someone today.<br/>\nStacie Tauscher<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\non 1/4/04 10:06 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Subject: New...got a ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My name is Wendy.

I come to the list from <br/>\nthe Yahoo home page and read the threads that I&#39;m interested in.  I <br/>\ntry to come at least once a day or twice, if I have time.  But, this <br/>\nway, if I don&#39;t have time for a few days (or longer)I&#39;m not bombared <br/>\nwith email that I don&#39;t have time to read.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI also just wanted to say that we moved a few months ago and I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t read at all for months.  I just got back on track at home and <br/>\ncame back to the group.  I too didn&#39;t realize how much I missed the <br/>\nlist until I started reading again.  It really is inspiring and has <br/>\nonce again reinforced my decision to both unschool my daughter and <br/>\nto stay at home with her.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1941545393\">Hi Wendy,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just changed from digest version to individual e-mails, and I had 196 messages when I checked my e-mail last night after being away all day!  I started out with the digest and quickly noticed I would get 3-5 digests per day of usually 25 posts each.  Wow!  I wanted to read everything too, and did at first (at least the beginnings of each), but then gradually became more familiar with ongoing threads and began to prioritize according to my interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe digest begins with listing the subjects of each e-mail (along with who from, etc.) by number, and when I began to prioritize I began jotting down the numbers of the ones I wanted to read - certain particular threads and all new ones.  I switched to e-mails because it was time consuming to scroll through the huge digests to find what I wanted.  Last night to go through the 196 e-mails I had waiting (a new record!) I first just deleted each one that I would love to read if I had the time but just don&#39;t!  That left me with only maybe 30-40 or so.  Since most are fairly brief responses, it did not take long at all to read these. <br/>\n<br/>\n The whole process took maybe 30 minutes.  This is actually a fairly large block of time to add into my day, but the tremendous support I have found just reading other people&#39;s opinions, the exciting responses to my own posts from folks who share my interests, and the tremendous debate/discussion makes it valuable time to me, and worth making the time for.  (I live in a small town with mostly Christian school-at-home homeschoolers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps,<br/>\nAmy in St. Albans, VT<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: wbmscm <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 04, 2004 9:24 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] New...got a ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My name is Wendy.
