I agree with it all. <br/>\nJust think about when your kids were younger and what you had to do to get <br/>\nout of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou started earlier and helped them all along the way. Taking articles of <br/>\nclothing to them and either helping them or asking them to put something on. <br/>\nReminding them to go to the bathroom or brush their teeth or comb their hair <br/>\nor just doing it all for them. I&#39;m sure if you just help you son along by <br/>\neith doing or helping him by being right there, he will get to the point <br/>\nwhere he won&#39;t get as sidetracked. Just telling him right now and leaving <br/>\nhim just gives him way too much time to find other interesting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck I find things half done throughout my house all the time from me going <br/>\nfrom one thing to another and then finding something else I want to do <br/>\nalso!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTired of spam?
