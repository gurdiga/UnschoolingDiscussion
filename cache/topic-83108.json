Lexie had her first sleep over at age four, Janene <br/>\nat age five.   Both sleepovers took place with the idea I would and <br/>\ncould come get them at any time and with people who parent as we do.  <br/>\nLexie, at age 8, is just now ready for spending a week away from mom and <br/>\ndad, and that she has done with another unschooling family who shares <br/>\nmost of our own beliefs and who raise their children pretty much the <br/>\nsame as we do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, each child is different.  I think Lexie could and would spend a <br/>\nweek with my parents, but I would not allow Janene to do this at this <br/>\ntime.  Part of it is age, part of it is personality.  Janene is just not <br/>\nas likely to &quot;play the game&quot; with my parents as Lexie will, and this <br/>\nwould create stress and cause problems.  I can SO see Janene not <br/>\ncleaning up and some people not getting that at age five she needs help. <br/>\n<br/>\nI should add that while my kids both have done sleep aways (Janene <br/>\nhaving done maybe 2, Lexie having spent a few weeks away from me and a <br/>\nlot of sleep overs at age 8) until a few months ago I had never spent a <br/>\nnight away from them.  I was stuck in Vegas with car problems and the <br/>\ngirls came back with my brother and spent the night and day away from <br/>\nme.  It was interesting and OK.  I was lost without them, without <br/>\nresponsibility. But they were fine.  I really don&#39;t believe in parents <br/>\nleaving their kids for weekends or longer until it is clear the kids are <br/>\nready and I don&#39;t think that happens at age three.  Gee at three my kids <br/>\nwere both still nursing.  They are still such babies and need mommy to <br/>\nput them to bed.  Personally I&#39;d rather takea  vacation we all could <br/>\nenjoy and afford than leave my little ones before they were ready, <br/>\nespecially with folks who may or may not respect our views on children. <br/>\n<br/>\nmy 2cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nNicolas and Madeline Donck; Rains wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My boys spent the weekend with their grandmother (my MIL) and were <br/>\n&gt; happy to<br/>\n&gt; go, as she was to have them.  However, from what she told us in phone <br/>\n&gt; calls<br/>\n&gt; over the weekend and from conversations with her and with the kids <br/>\n&gt; when we<br/>\n&gt; got back we realized how angry she is feeling about how much freedom the<br/>\n&gt; kids have been given since starting unschooling in April.  This was the<br/>\n&gt; most time she has spent with them since unschooling.   She had no problem<br/>\n&gt; with my 6yo because he is so self-sufficient and loves to play <br/>\n&gt; outdoors on<br/>\n&gt; the farm by himself and happily helps her with her chickens.  But our 3yo<br/>\n&gt; asked for food all day long and had lots of puzzles and coloring books <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; papers, toys, etc. out all over her floor.  Apparently he wouldn&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; clean it all up when she asked (he is used to me cleaning with him) <br/>\n&gt; and he<br/>\n&gt; went into a shaking rage.  I have never seen him do anything this<br/>\n&gt; intense.  He has gotten angry of course but nothing like she <br/>\n&gt; described.  He<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t tell us that he had a bad time or anything but it is clear that <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; are frustrated with each other.  She also doesn&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; make them say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thankyou&quot; before we give them something.  We<br/>\n&gt; model it and remind them ocassionally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are having her over for dinner tonight to talk to her about our<br/>\n&gt; parenting principles; after the kids are asleep.  I want to tell her that<br/>\n&gt; the main thing I have learned here is to treat the children with respect<br/>\n&gt; and to do away with all authoritarian parenting.  They make their own<br/>\n&gt; choices.  We do talk about acting respectfully all the time and point out<br/>\n&gt; when they are not respectful.  I just don&#39;t know how much consistent<br/>\n&gt; respect she can expect from  the 3yo (or 6yo) if she is talking down <br/>\n&gt; to him<br/>\n&gt; or with anger.  How to tell her this, without just putting her on the<br/>\n&gt; defensive?  We really want her to get it.  She is a big part of their <br/>\n&gt; lives<br/>\n&gt; and may be alone with them for a week (unless this situation doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; change) when dh and I go to my brother&#39;s wedding in Australia.  <br/>\n&gt; Thankyou in<br/>\n&gt; advance for any ideas.<br/>\n&gt; Madeline<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I think the few bad moments between <br/>\nshe and Jesse on Sunday were exaggerated by our nervousness about being <br/>\naway from them (this was a trial run before Australia).    Also, a <br/>\nwonderful young woman who works at the farm will be with them for most of <br/>\nevery day while we are in Australia.

I will talk about the kids I saw at the conference and <br/>\nthe Ga unschoolers who came to our farm (I wish she had spent more time <br/>\nwith them) and will talk about the changes we have experienced in our kids <br/>\nsince gradually changing the way we parent.

She has been alone with them for a few hours and commented <br/>\nabout how intelligent they are and how much fun it was to learn yoga from <br/>\nthem or hear the latest dinosaur info. etc.  But now that there was a bad <br/>\nday with Jesse I think all the blame is put on our parenting.  I guess I <br/>\nwant her to recognize, as I have had to lately, that our moods and style <br/>\n(as the adult caretakers) have a huge bearing on how the children are going <br/>\nto feel and act.  My MIL was feeling sick all weekend (wish we hadn&#39;t left <br/>\nnow but she insisted she was fine, until we returned!)  I think a lot of <br/>\nwhat happened was about how she was feeling.  It is no fun to suddenly be <br/>\nalone with kids when you have no energy and feel lousy.  I don&#39;t want ot <br/>\nshame her just to ask her to understand why we take  time to explain things <br/>\nto them and why it is O.K. with us if the little one makes a mess and then <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to clean it up.  I want a simple way of telling her.  But I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking the only way she may understand is by having more of those <br/>\nexciting fun days with them and letting go of her story about Jesse being <br/>\n&quot;spoiled&#39;&quot; because of these few hard days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;***Can you borrow money to take the kids with you?<br/>\n&gt;How sad for them to be away from you for a week AND miss a trip to Australia!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And how sad if that week with their grandmother creates so much unhappiness<br/>\n&gt;that the therapy to undo it would cost as much as two fares to Australia, <br/>\n&gt;too.*****<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The wedding is in Feb.

However, from what she told us<br/>\nin phone calls<br/>\n| over the weekend and from conversations with her and with the<br/>\nkids when we<br/>\n| got back we realized how angry she is feeling about how much<br/>\nfreedom the<br/>\n| kids have been given since starting unschooling in April.<br/>\nThis was the<br/>\n| most time she has spent with them since unschooling.   She had<br/>\nno problem<br/>\n| with my 6yo because he is so self-sufficient and loves to play<br/>\noutdoors on<br/>\n| the farm by himself and happily helps her with her chickens.<br/>\nBut our 3yo<br/>\n| asked for food all day long and had lots of puzzles and<br/>\ncoloring books and<br/>\n| papers, toys, etc. out all over her floor.  Apparently he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t just<br/>\n| clean it all up when she asked (he is used to me cleaning with<br/>\nhim) and he<br/>\n| went into a shaking rage.  I have never seen him do anything<br/>\nthis<br/>\n| intense.  He has gotten angry of course but nothing like she<br/>\ndescribed.  He<br/>\n| didn&#39;t tell us that he had a bad time or anything but it is<br/>\nclear that they<br/>\n| are frustrated with each other.  She also doesn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhy we don&#39;t<br/>\n| make them say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thankyou&quot; before we give them<br/>\nsomething.  We<br/>\n| model it and remind them ocassionally.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| We are having her over for dinner tonight to talk to her about<br/>\nour<br/>\n| parenting principles; after the kids are asleep.  I want to<br/>\ntell her that<br/>\n| the main thing I have learned here is to treat the children<br/>\nwith respect<br/>\n| and to do away with all authoritarian parenting.

How to tell her this, without just putting her<br/>\non the<br/>\n| defensive?  We really want her to get it.

However, from what she told us in phone calls <br/>\nover the weekend and from conversations with her and with the kids when we <br/>\ngot back we realized how angry she is feeling about how much freedom the <br/>\nkids have been given since starting unschooling in April.  This was the <br/>\nmost time she has spent with them since unschooling.   She had no problem <br/>\nwith my 6yo because he is so self-sufficient and loves to play outdoors on <br/>\nthe farm by himself and happily helps her with her chickens.  But our 3yo <br/>\nasked for food all day long and had lots of puzzles and coloring books and <br/>\npapers, toys, etc. out all over her floor.  Apparently he wouldn&#39;t just <br/>\nclean it all up when she asked (he is used to me cleaning with him) and he <br/>\nwent into a shaking rage.  I have never seen him do anything this <br/>\nintense.  He has gotten angry of course but nothing like she described.  He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t tell us that he had a bad time or anything but it is clear that they <br/>\nare frustrated with each other.  She also doesn&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t <br/>\nmake them say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thankyou&quot; before we give them something.  We <br/>\nmodel it and remind them ocassionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are having her over for dinner tonight to talk to her about our <br/>\nparenting principles; after the kids are asleep.  I want to tell her that <br/>\nthe main thing I have learned here is to treat the children with respect <br/>\nand to do away with all authoritarian parenting.  They make their own <br/>\nchoices.  We do talk about acting respectfully all the time and point out <br/>\nwhen they are not respectful.  I just don&#39;t know how much consistent <br/>\nrespect she can expect from  the 3yo (or 6yo) if she is talking down to him <br/>\nor with anger.  How to tell her this, without just putting her on the <br/>\ndefensive?  We really want her to get it.  She is a big part of their lives <br/>\nand may be alone with them for a week (unless this situation doesn&#39;t <br/>\nchange) when dh and I go to my brother&#39;s wedding in Australia.
