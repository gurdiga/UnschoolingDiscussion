I make cloth art dolls and spend quite a bit of that<br/>\ntime doing hand sewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband used to have a hard time with it, but he knows me better now<br/>\nand understands that I need to have quiet time just for me (ok,<br/>\nsometimes with friends).  Without that time I can get really grumpy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to make it to the gym 3 days a week, the kids play in the<br/>\nkids gym and I get a good workout.  The other two days we take long<br/>\nwalks together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I calm myself, without it my life would feel like chaos (not<br/>\nthat it really is, I just like peace and quiet - and it isn&#39;t quiet here<br/>\nmost of the time - lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\nwho&#39;s children are eating their ice cream and smearing it on themselves<br/>\nwhile taking a bath.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":36449576,"authorName":"sognokids@aol.com","from":"sognokids@...","profile":"sognokids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Unschooling your spirit","postDate":"1045442538","msgId":59191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyLjJkMGFkY2UzLjJiODE4OWVhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59209,"prevInTime":59190,"nextInTime":59192,"topicId":59191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope it s OK to ask this here.
