It&#39;s probable if he&#39;s unschooled. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how old your son is, but there were years when Laurie did <br/>\nas little as possible. I kept the faith open and my mouth shut. When <br/>\nhe finds his passion, he&#39;ll put forth the effort necessary, and it <br/>\nwon&#39;t even seem like effort to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if your son is given the freedom to choose how he spends his <br/>\ntime he won&#39;t end up a being like the members of the family who had <br/>\nno choices early in life. Support ANYTHING he does, including playing <br/>\ncomputer games all day, watching tv, whatever... it&#39;s what he needs <br/>\nright now and if he has support and no &quot;comments&quot; about wasting his <br/>\nlife, he&#39;ll get past it much faster. <br/>\n<br/>\nAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH to kids needing to be teased so they can deal with it <br/>\nwhen they are older. AAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH to the morons that say such <br/>\nthings. Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will kill <br/>\nme. I STILL remember the teasing taunts of childhood and vow to <br/>\nsomeday get back at those creeps! Calm down Valerie...I am teasing <br/>\nabout getting them back, btw. I&#39;ll just let them shine my shoes. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to be totally insensitive...but I bet flotsom is not useless.;-)<br/>\nI had to say that since Laurie acted in her first play last week at <br/>\nthe college. She co-wrote the play and was marvelous!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in reply to being pilloried... damn it...do nothing and watch him <br/>\nbloom and take charge of his own life. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling = Patient Parent<br/>\nValerie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;ravensegg@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I LOVED this story!!

And trying to explain <br/>\n that we&#39;re not is really difficult. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n     Hi Jeanmarie and welcome...I can relate to what you&#39;re saying somewhat <br/>\nbecause we didn&#39;t start of as unschoolers.  First we became disallusioned <br/>\nwith the school system, then we went to homeschooling, and finally we went to <br/>\nunschooling.  I WISH we had unschooled from the beginning with all of our <br/>\nkids.  The more structured homeschooling always &quot;deteriorated&quot; into doing <br/>\nwhatever because I wasn&#39;t that motivated to stick with much of a structure.  <br/>\nBut I used to feel like I should be doing &quot;better&quot; with all of that.  <br/>\nFinally, I started reading more unschooling books and realized that it seemed <br/>\nlike the best thing.  All the other stuff involved too much forcing of kids <br/>\nto do something they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n     So my oldest three sons, ages (almost) 17, 13, and 13, have been <br/>\nunschooling the past few years and my younger two, ages 9 and 4, will get to <br/>\nunschool completely.  I hope school and my misguided homeschooling attempts <br/>\nin years past haven&#39;t caused too much harm to my older kids!<br/>\n     Anyway, maybe you can just tell people the homeschooling is coming <br/>\naround wonderfully.  Now you don&#39;t have to feel that you&#39;re not doing <br/>\nanything; you&#39;re unschooling, letting him find his own rightful path, doing <br/>\nthings he&#39;s interested in, which he&#39;s much more likely to remember anyway.<br/>\n     In case you haven&#39;t already read it, I would highly recommend reading <br/>\nThe Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn (sp?).  It&#39;s great and he <br/>\nmight like reading some of it, too.  And of course, when Val&#39;s book comes <br/>\nout, it will be great!

That&#39;s my first reaction to finding this group.  I came on just a few <br/>\nposts before Valerie&#39;s first post about her daughter and I&#39;ve never felt so <br/>\nvalidated about what has happened around here than I did after reading that. <br/>\n  Thank you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;ll give you a quick intro of myself.  I&#39;m the mother of 3 children - <br/>\n1 daughter, 21 and 2 boys 18 & 13.  The first 2 did traditional school.  My <br/>\n21 yr old is graduating from college this year and my 18 yo is graduating <br/>\nfrom high school.  But due to a very bad 7th grade year for my now 13 yo we <br/>\nopted to not send him back to Jr High (the horror grade level of public <br/>\nschool, in my opinion) and we were planning on doing a traditional <br/>\nhome-schooling program this past year.  Well, it didn&#39;t happen.  For several <br/>\nreasons... the big one being his attitude about being pressured and also the <br/>\nfact that I work 32 hrs/week (4 days).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we played with history books, and bought math books and everything <br/>\nended up sliding and we just ended up enjoying each other.  His personality <br/>\nhas improved 100% and his self-esteem at least that much.  But all along <br/>\nI&#39;ve had to deal with the question... &quot;So, how&#39;s that homeschooling coming?&quot; <br/>\nfrom the people I work with and with family members.  And trying to explain <br/>\nthat we&#39;re not is really difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to convince myself that I wasn&#39;t going to worry about what he did and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do and if we got nothing else out of this year but him feeling better <br/>\nand behaving better I could call it successful.  Well, as the &quot;school&quot; year <br/>\nrolls down I&#39;m seeing that it was successful.  But convincing his older <br/>\nsiblings of that is tough. (My dd is graduating with a bachelors in <br/>\nPsychology and works with troubled children so she knows &quot;everything&quot; about <br/>\nhow we&#39;re doing this all wrong).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for making me feel good about this and for being here.  I know <br/>\nI&#39;ll have a ton of questions as I get to know everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanmarie (in Utah)<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com\">http://explorer.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20491,"nextTopicId":20505}}
