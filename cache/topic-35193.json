I know I can<br/>\nhave him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon<br/>\nrequirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in<br/>\nOregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things<br/>\nimprove enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to<br/>\nsend him home without the requirements to enter third grade in<br/>\nCalifornia.**<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Ruby --<br/>\n<br/>\nThe California State Education Department lists on their website the big<br/>\nfancy learning standards that they have adopted for every grade level up<br/>\nto 12th.  They are pretty intimidating -- I certainly don&#39;t believe that<br/>\nall children in all CA schools are coming close to learning this much.<br/>\nHowever, it will give you a general idea of what his former teacher<br/>\nmight be ATTEMPTING to teach her second grade students.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t let it make you crazy.  As I&#39;m sure you know, just pouring<br/>\nlove over your grandson is going to be a lot more important than<br/>\nstuffing knowledge in him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe website:<br/>\n<br/>\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cde.ca.gov/standards/\">http://www.cde.ca.gov/standards/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe standards are in PDF documents, arranged by grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35142,"nextTopicId":35203}}
