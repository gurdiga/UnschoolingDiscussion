No doubt, future generations will be amused at our peculiar  taboo, <br/>\nlaughing in sociology classes at our backwardness, yet also puzzled by  it given <br/>\nour high rates of disease and premature pregnancy. We will look  foolish in <br/>\nthe light of history.  <br/>\nOver the months since I left Washington and settled into my home in Little  <br/>\nRock, I have pondered the rage, embarrassment and shock with which the word  <br/>\n&quot;masturbation&quot; is met in our culture. What other word, merely voiced, can  <br/>\nprovide justification to fire a surgeon general -- or anyone?  <br/>\nWhat horrible betrayal of our proud race does masturbation conjure in our  <br/>\nminds? As a physician, and as the nation&#39;s physician, it was important to  <br/>\nanswer every question posed to me with clear information.  <br/>\nInformed decisions require knowledge. To insure the health and well-being  of <br/>\na patient, age-appropriate information must be made available. Some call it  <br/>\ncandor -- I call it common sense and good medicine. On the other hand,  <br/>\ncoquetries can be more than deceptive: both the refrain from  self-gratification and <br/>\nthe concealment of it can result in sexual dysfunction.   <br/>\nYet to study masturbation would be to admit its role in our lives -- one  <br/>\nthat many of us are not comfortable with. Instead, we discourage the practice  in <br/>\nour children, dispensing cautionary tales that read like Steven King  <br/>\nnovellas. These myths were more understandable before Pasteur enlightened the  world <br/>\nto the presence of germs in the 1870s; prior to his discovery, no one  really <br/>\nknew where diseases came from. Masturbation was blamed for dreaded  conditions <br/>\nlike syphilis and gonorrhea, as well as for their ramifications:  dementia, <br/>\nblindness and infertility, to name a few. It&#39;s remarkable that some  of these <br/>\nrumors still circulate despite clear evidence that they are  unfounded.  <br/>\nThe wall of myth surrounding self-sex is just beginning to crack -- thanks,  <br/>\nin part, to President Clinton who put it in the news. For the first time the  <br/>\ntopic is being broached on popular television shows, and comedians are able to <br/>\n joke about it without alienating their audiences. You can even find a <br/>\nvariety  of &quot;how-to&quot; books in the &quot;sex and health&quot; section of most bookstores. The  <br/>\noverwhelming majority of psychologists and medical professionals seem to  <br/>\nbelieve that sex-for-one is a natural part of living; we all touch our hair,  <br/>\nnecks, knees and many other spots on our bodies in public to calm ourselves or  to <br/>\nscratch itches, and it is no less acceptable, they assure us, to touch  other <br/>\nbody parts in private.  <br/>\nA friend, a senior citizen, stopped me after church one Sunday and said,  <br/>\n&quot;Please tell the children that masturbation won&#39;t hurt them. I spent my entire  <br/>\nyouth in agony waiting to go blind, because my parents told me that&#39;s what  <br/>\nwould happen if I masturbated. I guess I could have stopped, but going blind  <br/>\nseemed the better option.&quot;  <br/>\nWe all want to tell our children the truth about their bodies and sex, but  <br/>\nmany of us are afraid of the consequences. Parents need to let go of the idea  <br/>\nthat ignorance maintains innocence and begin teaching age-appropriate facts to <br/>\n children. Informed children know what sexual abuse and harassment are, what  <br/>\nnormal physical closeness with others is, what should be reported, and to  <br/>\nwhom. Rather than tell children that touching themselves is forbidden, parents  <br/>\nmay gently explain that this is best done in private.  <br/>\nOne enlightened friend shared with me the story of how she taught her  <br/>\npre-school-aged daughter about her anatomy: The mother told the girl about her  <br/>\nvagina as they examined theirs together with mirrors. There was some  discussion <br/>\nand admiration. Later that day, friends came to dinner at their  home, and at <br/>\nthe dinner table the father asked his daughter what she had done  during the <br/>\nday. Of course, she told him the most interesting thing that had  happened: she <br/>\nand Mommy looked at their vaginas. But hers was prettier than  her mommy&#39;s -- <br/>\n&quot;Want to see?&quot; The stunned dinner guests were silent as the  mother quickly <br/>\nretreated with her daughter to explain privacy. It is never  okay to shame <br/>\nchildren for natural inquisitiveness or behavior: that shame  lasts forever.  <br/>\nMasturbation, practiced consciously or unconsciously, cultivates in us a  <br/>\nhumble elegance -- an awareness that we are part of a larger natural system,  the <br/>\npassions and rhythms of which live on in us. Sexuality is part of  creation, <br/>\npart of our common inheritance, and it reminds us that we are  neither <br/>\ninherently better nor worse than our sisters and brothers. Far from  evil, <br/>\nmasturbation just may render heavenly contentment in those who  dare.<br/>\n©1997 M.

One has had sex a little, a couple of years back, and <br/>\nextricated himself from the relationship because it didn&#39;t seem right and good. <br/>\n  The other two haven&#39;t.   They have friends who have.   If those friends <br/>\nneeded a condom, my kids would have some.   I don&#39;t know what the other kids&#39; <br/>\nparents have said to them or how prepared they are.   I do know that both Kirby <br/>\nand Marty are good relationship counsellors, at least in the way of helping <br/>\npeople clarify their thoughts.   Kirby was 15, I think-maybe 14), when he talked <br/>\nan older friend out of a divorce, and helped coach him to making the <br/>\nrelationship better.   That seemed good evidence to me that Kirby had carefully <br/>\nconsidered all kinds of factors, not just sex, not just &quot;having a relationship&quot; in <br/>\nthat teen &quot;going out&quot; way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe my kids have interpersonal skills naturally (a la Howard Gardner&#39;s <br/>\ninterpersonal intelligence) and that would make it easier to talk to them about <br/>\nsuch things, and easier for them to pick up other clues from all around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould kids with less natural talent for interpersonal factors need more <br/>\nrules?

They might <br/>\nthink differently (and might wish they knew less than they know &lt;g&gt;) but open, <br/>\nregular discussion of sexuality as it arises in everyday life seems great to me, <br/>\nand we&#39;ve always had that here.     <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly and I discussed bisexuality last week, and specifically the prejudices <br/>\nboth within and without &quot;the gay community&quot; about the idea that someone could <br/>\nbe &quot;only partly gay&quot; or &quot;completely gay.&quot;   Prejudices are changing.    There <br/>\nhave been a couple of teenaged girls of their acquaintance who have both &quot;a <br/>\ngirlfriend&quot; and a boyfriend.   Some are having sex, others might not be.   We <br/>\ntalked about the Chinese yin/yang take on relationships, and how that ties in <br/>\nwith Freud&#39;s take on what &quot;caused&quot; homosexuality in men.   Freud wasn&#39;t <br/>\nconsidering it a genetic reality, just an aberration.   Combining what Freud observed <br/>\nwith what the Chinese believe (that a good couple needs a balance of male and <br/>\nfemale energy, so the more feminine the female, the more masculine the male; <br/>\nthe more masculine the female, the more feminine the male, to have the ideal <br/>\nbalance) and taking genetics into consideration, maybe Freud was onto something, <br/>\nwith a passive father and dominant mother, but what he was missing was that <br/>\nthe passive father may himself have had &quot;homosexual tendencies&quot; and that could <br/>\npass down.   Its rough theory, not full-polished FACT, but it was worth <br/>\ndiscussing with Holly and she will for the rest of her life be ready to &quot;connect the <br/>\ndots&quot; to every situation she comes across.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother day she had a fever blister and we discussed herpes virus, and what <br/>\nused to be believed, and what the current ideas are, and that things will <br/>\nprobably change.   I told her that in the 80&#39;s there were dating networks, formal <br/>\nand informal, by which people with herpes found people who also had herpes to <br/>\ngo out with.   Knowledge will change again about what it is and how to treat <br/>\nit.   Many things are not known.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to *TELL* Holly things about &quot;alternative sexuality&quot; or herpes and <br/>\ntell her as though I knew the final and factual answer, I don&#39;t think that <br/>\nwould be helpful.   If I were to take a stance that was non-accepting, <br/>\nclosed-minded and judgmental, that would be about the same as to say &quot;Starting now, just <br/>\nignore me.&quot;   It wouldn&#39;t help her make decisions in the future, or to keep <br/>\nan eye out for new research.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Am I the only one that believes that monogamy truly is best for our<br/>\nspecies??

It was literally<br/>\nthe first time it ever dawned on me to buy them for my<br/>\nkids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to the parents who asked their daughter 45<br/>\ntimes a week, I had a girlfriend in high school who&#39;s<br/>\nparents were like this.  They tried (what they thought<br/>\nwas) doing everything and anything -- very strict<br/>\ncurfew, she was not allowed to have a &quot;steady&quot;<br/>\nboyfriend, when going out with a boy it had to be with<br/>\nothers (in a group), her mom would show up<br/>\noccassionally at the places she said she was going to<br/>\ncheck up, and sometimes she had to call her every hour<br/>\non the hour. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, she was having sex at least once a<br/>\nweek, probably more, for years, and the main thing she<br/>\nlearned from everything her parents did was to be a<br/>\nbetter liar.  Her parents still think to this day that<br/>\nshe was a &quot;good&quot; virgin Catholic girl on her wedding<br/>\nday.  LOL....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think back to my own high school years.  My<br/>\nparents educated me about using birth control and told<br/>\nme that they would rather I wait until I was older to<br/>\nhave sex, but if I did, please be safe.  I had a lot<br/>\nof friends, who were from religious families, who were<br/>\nforbidden to have sex, <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com/2005/06/for-safe-sex.html\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com/2005/06/for-safe-sex.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tableforfive.blogspot.com\">http://tableforfive.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com\">http://homemadeliving.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

We are a family with 9 children. One","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1504591722\">Hi Sandra,<br/>\n  I&#39;m new here and have been reading alot of posts waiting for the right subject & moment, well here it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are a family with 9 children. One stepdaughter, 3 biological children, and 5 adopted. From an early age I have been openly honest with my kids (to the point of some of them saying &quot;yuck&quot;) about sex, the responsibilities, & consquenses.  My reasons being, my mom never discussed anything with me. When I started my period at an early age I didnt even know what it was !!  All I ever learned about sex was from friends & boyfriends. Didnt even know what birth control was the first time I had sex at a very early age ( long story - low self asteem, no parental communication & a very convincing boyfriend)<br/>\n  Needless to say, I had my first child when I was 16.  I love my kids intensely, dont get me wrong, but if I could go back & change the time table I would. Only if nothing else would change though, since I know that can&#39;t happen as all events effect others, I&#39;m not looking for a time machine. My story worked out great- been married since 16 and still going strong. Chose to have a big family, no regrets but some young kids don&#39;t have the luck we did.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I dont necessarily have resentment at having to grown up really fast & taking on the adult responsibilities that go along with a family, but there are times I would love to have just 48 hrs to go back and be carefree. I say 48hrs because I&#39;d need 24 to have fun and 24 to recoup !!   <br/>\n<br/>\n  This all leads to the birth control issue, I think condoms should be in classrooms, in bathrooms, in coffee houses, on buses, in libraries,any public place where kids hang - they should be.  I personally gave my boys whole boxes when they were 12 & 13 ( my 12yr old blew them up like balloons, guess he didnt think they&#39;s keep till he was ready :).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have 5 adopted children, 4 of which came from parents who didnt know how to take care of them and didnt know what birth control was ( one is 1 of 8, all by the time she was 22 !!! ). Sometimes I think McDonalds should have a teen meal that comes with a condom for the kids whose parents don&#39;t want to talk to them or dont care what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I took my sons daughter to a dr. for a check up & birthcontrol because her mother didnt give a sh*t about what happened. Her mom looked at it as an addition to her welfare check, not a new life her daughter would be responsible for if she got pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I totally agree, the people who think little Johnny is going to stop in the heat of the moment because his mommy said he should wait, are nuts.  Teaching abstinence(sp?), it doesnt work in most cases. But helping a young adult be informed & give him/her the right equipment to make an intelligent & informed decision - I believe thats the way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Carol <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I would LOVE to have someone else complain if I had given their kid a condom. <br/>\n    I would back them down my driveway SO FAST AND HARD and loudly that they <br/>\n  would never again say a single word about anything vaguely related to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t care if they were Catholic or Mormon or friggin NUNS.

When they&#39;re going camping with mixed groups, I <br/>\nremind them to take them and I don&#39;t ask them if they&#39;re going to need them, I&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid &quot;You might not need them, but someone else might.&quot;   They are there for <br/>\nANYone to use, and that keeps me from having to ask my boys if they need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; give them condoms.   I think it&#39;s a damned good idea, <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby said he didn&#39;t want them (when he was young), and kind of balked <br/>\nat the gift, I said &quot;I would hate for the first time you used a condom to be <br/>\nthe second time you had needed one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen passing through WalMart or Target with my kids, I started going through <br/>\nthe baby aisle and pausing to note a price or two, on a car seat or stroller.  <br/>\n And I mentioned in friendly fashion to each kid in turn (separate trips) <br/>\nthat condoms are way cheaper than car seats.    &quot;The birth control aisle,&quot; it has <br/>\ncome to be called. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t say the price stuff anymore, I just say &quot;Let&#39;s go through the birth <br/>\ncontrol aisle&quot; without further comment or pause, or I just go through there and <br/>\none of the kids will say &quot;birth control aisle.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the most serious comment I have on that other article though:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The Hinton<br/>\nhousehold has two loving parents with a strong relationship who asked the <br/>\nstraight-A<br/>\nRaechel &quot;45 times a week if she was having sex, doing drugs, drinking.

I&#39;ll <br/>\ncomment in another post.<br/>\n================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nLast school year, both high schools in the city&#39;s district reported 55 <br/>\npregnancies. Ninety-nine pregnancies are expected this year, most of them at Timken, <br/>\nwhere expecting students get six weeks of maternity leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;This has gotten to horrible proportions. I wish I knew the answer to why <br/>\nit&#39;s happening,&quot; principal Kim Redmond told the city&#39;s daily newspaper The <br/>\nRepository, which first revealed the pregnancy rate in a column last week. Redmond <br/>\ndid not return several messages left by The Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n Joanne Hinton, whose 16-year-old daughter, Raechel Hinton, is eight months <br/>\npregnant, said she believes the school&#39;s abstinence-based sex education program <br/>\nisn&#39;t enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;It&#39;s time to take the blinders off and realize that these kids are having <br/>\nsex,&quot; she said. &quot;Obviously, abstinence is not working. If we have to, just give <br/>\nthem condoms.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbstinence-based programs have been growing nationwide at schools over the <br/>\npast few years. In Ohio, the Bush&#39;s administration and the state&#39;s health <br/>\ndepartment have awarded $32 million in grants to Ohio agencies for abstinence <br/>\neducation since 2001.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hinton stresses that she doesn&#39;t condone teenage sex and that her daughter <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit the mold some may think pregnant teens come from: The Hinton <br/>\nhousehold has two loving parents with a strong relationship who asked the straight-A <br/>\nRaechel &quot;45 times a week if she was having sex, doing drugs, drinking. We <br/>\nwere constantly checking on her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Raechel, who plans to return to the 10th grade at Timken after delivering <br/>\nand completing an adoption, said many students are sexually active and need more <br/>\ninformation about birth control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the full article here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20050901151609990003&_ccc=6&\">http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20050901151609990003&_ccc=6&</a><br/>\ncid=842<br/>\nbut it&#39;s probably elsewhere too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108641,"nextTopicId":108589}}
