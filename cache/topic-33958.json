My post applies to just about everything that is non fiction that I<br/>\ntry to read. Even if I am interested in the topic. When I first started<br/>\nhomeschooling I would pick up those books and not read them. I have tried to<br/>\nread several John Holt books. Financial books (getting your finances in<br/>\norder), but maybe that is a bad example. Photography books (which I *love*).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nHow blurry is that? Did I help? Or did I make it worse?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I think that make some sense and it might help as my brain digests it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nWhy are you needing to process some specific information?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get better at things. Like taking pictures and working in photoshop. But<br/>\nhave you seen the manuals to Photoshop? I was looking in the library today<br/>\nand I picked a couple, but they were the thinnest books on the shelf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to actually take a photography class and a photoshop class at the<br/>\nlocal community college, but I have to have the camera for the photography<br/>\nclass (duh!) and all I have is a digital or I have to take Art classes where<br/>\nI am actually drawing things and that really isn&#39;t my thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nHumor is often non-fiction. I&#39;m thinking Eddie Izzard and George<br/>\nCarlin. Commentary.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI can listen to those things (but often don&#39;t think they are funny even<br/>\nthough I *do* relate to the comedian, much to the disappointment of DH) and<br/>\nwatch them, but definitely *not* read them<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nIs it possible what was meant was &quot;textbooks&quot;?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, and no. I can read *some* of your website and Joyce&#39;s. I have to read<br/>\nit in bits.

It has changed my perspective a little and that is probably<br/>\nmostly what I needed.

It&#39;s a particular hobbyhorse of mine, because<br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten grief over the years for &quot;marrying beneath me&quot;, since<br/>\nJason is &quot;only&quot; a contractor. Nevermind that he can build a house from<br/>\nthe ground up, he&#39;s somehow less than a pencilpusher. Sigh. So having<br/>\nmy personal opinions on this validated, is spiffy-cool, and nice for<br/>\nJason too, because you know he got slapped with the stupid brush all<br/>\nthe way through school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s my point? It&#39;s all nonfiction, but it&#39;s all connected to<br/>\nsomething I&#39;m doing, using, being. The thing I&#39;m participating in is<br/>\nfascinating, the reading is merely providing my activity more support,<br/>\nmore color, more texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s funny is that when I was making the list above, I almost<br/>\nincluded the Heinlein I have up there.  Because I&#39;m using it for a<br/>\nresearch project for a storywriting contest I promised a friend I&#39;d<br/>\nenter. So the Heinlein, clearly, fiction, is the only &quot;work&quot; reading<br/>\nI&#39;m doing right now! (Other than the stuff for my day job, where I&#39;m<br/>\nan editor). It&#39;s not really inspiring me much, though, so reading it<br/>\nis far more like effort than I&#39;m happy with, and I keep blowing it<br/>\noff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an editor, I find the line between fiction and nonfiction to be<br/>\nterribly blurry. Visioneers write about things that become reality<br/>\nlater. Early Asimov, William Gibson, oh heck, I make jokes about the<br/>\nMatrix all the time (I know, I just hopped from books to film, it&#39;s<br/>\nthe thought that counts), because they apply to the world I&#39;m in now,<br/>\nbut they didn&#39;t when they were created. So what does that make them?<br/>\nAt work, engineers write about technologies that don&#39;t exist yet, but<br/>\nwill soon. So right now it&#39;s fiction. In five years, it&#39;ll be some<br/>\nubiquitous thing we&#39;ve all seen one of. That&#39;s the coolest reading I<br/>\ndo. Fiction? Maybe. Maybe the line between fiction and non-fiction is<br/>\nsimply funding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow blurry is that? Did I help?

It depends on the subject, the style, the author, my interest, the time I have to devote to the book. I don&#39;t read much these days. I don&#39;t have the kind of time I like to give to a book. I have snatches of time, moments and minutes when I&#39;m not needed, not an hour at a go. I sleep in a room filled with bodies, and the ds is a smaller light than the reading lamp. I don&#39;t mind not reading, but when I do pick up a book I need it  to be something that I can get into and out of quickly. Which isn&#39;t usually non-fiction. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think chasing non-fiction as though it were inherently valuable is a very schooly thing. As is classing all non-fiction in a lump. We have lots of different non-fiction books scattered in our bookcases. Dictionaries and animal identification books and Encyclopedias from the 1940&#39;s that read almost like fiction given the changing face of knowledge (I love when people say that history is a static thing), books on dinosaurs and cats, a few self-help books, biographies, natural history books, text books, statistics, books on innumeracy, biology, anthropology, ethnology, botany, geology, books on tracking animals, cookbooks, and on and on and on. Some of them are things you don&#39;t really read at a go. Some are books that you start with good intentions, and then you flag and find a year later sitting at the bottom of the stack of books next to your bed along with a kleenex. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you want to read non-fiction?
