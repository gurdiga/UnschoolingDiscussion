He is wanting to get a job, but had already<br/>\ndecided that he wouldn&#39;t because he was only going to work for about six<br/>\nweeks, then quit when school starts.  He didn&#39;t think that would be fair to<br/>\nan employer (to be trained, then quit) but he also didn&#39;t think that he<br/>\nshould keep a job if he was starting school as that could be way too much<br/>\nstress.  Now he says that he would rather get a job and earn his own money<br/>\nand not bother with school.  He&#39;s so busy with his computer work (and he<br/>\ntells me, it IS real work) - making websites, helping others with their<br/>\nwebsites, creating and sharing games and testing others&#39; games, that I think<br/>\nhe finally realized that he&#39;d have almost no time for that with school.  He<br/>\nwants to just work maybe two days/week (which is all he really can at age 14<br/>\nanyway) and have the rest of his time free for his computer activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooray!<br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95894,"nextTopicId":95480}}
