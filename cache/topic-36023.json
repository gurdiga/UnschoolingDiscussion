So, the plan <br/>\n&gt;&gt;right now (and like I said, I&#39;m just learning all this, so I&#39;d love <br/>\n&gt;&gt;feedback from you!) is to sit down with my daughter before our &quot;nonschool&quot; <br/>\n&gt;&gt;year starts and talk about themes she&#39;d like to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>pursue next year.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of thoughts come to mind as I read this.

Start your learning <br/>\nadventure right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second thought is, of course, about the idea of trying to plan out your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s learning. Schools do that so they can accomodate 30 kids per <br/>\nclassroom, and 100&#39;s of kids per school. There has to be a plan with that <br/>\nmany little bodies to teach and that many parents to be acccountable to. <br/>\nHowever, YOU don&#39;t have those constraints. You are free to let your daughter <br/>\nfollow her interests *as they happen*. If you get too caught up in a plan or <br/>\nthematic unit of study, you may miss the opportunity to pursue all the new <br/>\nand interesting things that come up that you both have never even thought of <br/>\nyet.<br/>\n<br/>\nChild-led activities can mean starting our thinking about endangered <br/>\nspecies, but then only giving it a cursory glance. While doing that a <br/>\ndrawing of an animal skeleton sparks an interest and takes you in a <br/>\ncompletely different direction. Or the bubbles in an aquarium. Or the <br/>\nstreetlights on the drive over. Or the weather. Or the music on the radio. <br/>\nOr.....<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36043,"nextTopicId":36041}}
