Last spring (ironically it<br/>\nwas just about the time *I* had really become comfortable with his never<br/>\nwanting to do what I considered academic) he announced that not only did he<br/>\nwant to do more &quot;schoolwork&quot; next year, he wanted to try to get a diploma<br/>\nthrough the public program he&#39;s registered with.  While I don&#39;t believe<br/>\neither is necessary, I was willing to help him achieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far this year (since September) he&#39;s put in maybe an hour a week on<br/>\nacademic stuff.  I started getting into nagging mode on the whole thing.  It<br/>\nwas partly because he&#39;d keep me waiting most of the day with one excuse<br/>\nafter another for why he couldn&#39;t to start yet.  I finally told him the time<br/>\nperiod that I would be available each day to help him.  I explained that I<br/>\nwas having trouble organizing my day when I didn&#39;t know when I&#39;d need to<br/>\nhelp him.  He hasn&#39;t asked for help since, so I&#39;m assuming that his goal<br/>\neither isn&#39;t really what he thinks it is, or it&#39;s coming from someone else.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Questions about Unschooling","postDate":"1035506838","msgId":47863,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBINEkwMExZS0k2VUhOQG10YTcucGx0bjEzLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48264,"prevInTime":47862,"nextInTime":47864,"topicId":47863,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
