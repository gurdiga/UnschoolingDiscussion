It takes such a tremendous amount of courage to <br/>\nadmit our faults and seek a better way.  I well know that it is often easier <br/>\nto take the low road, the road well traveled.  Those programmed thoughts and <br/>\nreactions ARE so hard to get rid of.  The best thing you could have done for <br/>\nyourself and your children is admit your weaknesses and seek new ways.  The <br/>\nhard part is changing overnight.  I&#39;ve been there.  I AM there.
