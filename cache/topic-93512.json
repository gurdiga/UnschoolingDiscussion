This time of year <br/>\nthey seem to be up later because the sun is still out and they like <br/>\nenjoying the evening hours. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a poem about <br/>\nthis, called &quot;Bed in Summer&quot;, it always sounded so sad to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn winter I get up at night<br/>\nAnd dress by yellow candle-light.<br/>\nIn summer quite the other way,<br/>\nI have to go to bed by day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to go to bed and see<br/>\nThe birds still hopping on the tree,<br/>\nOr hear the grown-up people&#39;s feet<br/>\nStill going past me in the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd does it not seem hard to you,<br/>\nWhen all the sky is clear and blue,<br/>\nAnd I should like so much to play,<br/>\nTo have to go to bed by day?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, it&#39;s pretty understandable for kids to want to still be <br/>\nup when exciting things are going on. If there&#39;s something I need or <br/>\nwant to do by myself in the mighttime hours, I just tell the kids <br/>\nthey&#39;ll need to play on their own, read, or whatever. I can get out a <br/>\ngame or puzzle or something else for them to do if they&#39;re not <br/>\noccupied.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time of year, my alone time is usually in the morning, before <br/>\nthey wake up. But because my kids inherited DH&#39;s non-sleeping gene <br/>\n(he only sleeps 5 - 6 hours a night), I need just about as much sleep <br/>\nas they do, so I don&#39;t get a lot of time without them awake, to be <br/>\nhonest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, DH is out of town and they&#39;re both going for a sleepover. I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t slept in an empty house in years and year.

They  stay up if they<br/>\nstay in the playroom or their bedrooms. Generally at that time of evening,<br/>\n(later than 11:30) they aren&#39;t being loud.

So starting on<br/>\nSat.we will get up a little earlier so that by Mon. we are prepared!!!<br/>\nWaking up early that day with no preparation has us all rather cranky.
