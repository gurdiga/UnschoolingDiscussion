I also find that I can believe most everything they say up until they open their mouths.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Lynda<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The problem with the theory that big government is pulling a fast one about the dangers of nuclear energy is that there are just waaay too many non-government folks working on these projects.  It used to be that whistle blowers were shut up, now they are protected by law.  They talk to each other, and they talk to their families.  They go home at night to their children, just like my husband does every day.  If there is a problem, it&#39;s in their best interest to speak up. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad worked on the design for Three Mile Island One.  He will tell anyone who asks that the crew was shoddy, the engineering half-assed, and the safety protocols ignored.  SO when they asked him to come back for the TMI2 project, he refused.  He told them he did not want to work with such a bad team, no matter what they paid him.  We all know what happened to the TMI2 project.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the dirt....the natural radon problem in some soils is much worse than what the nuclear facilities are allowed to release as clean soil.  The soil at the park where you take your kids to play could easily be more naturally reactive than the stuff they want to use from nuclear plants.  Natural radiation occurs from the natural decay of atomic particles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nShow off your pagan (and Idaho) pride, get Idaho Pagan Mail(tm) today!<br/>\nSign up at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.idahopagan.com/\">http://www.idahopagan.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13806,"nextTopicId":13807}}
