I do not feel that the label served<br/>\nme well personally, although it did get me out of some boring classes and<br/>\ngive me more time to &quot;goof off&quot; :-). My husband OTOH, was<br/>\nlabeled a &quot;slow learner&quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSame.  My:  &quot;High IQ&quot; and all the accompanying pressure and BS from parents <br/>\nand teachers and counselors and principals.   Husband:  Profoundly average, <br/>\nat which point official people started kinda ignoring him and being satisfied <br/>\nwith very little, and not expecting anything special.  He&#39;s now a hotshot <br/>\nengineer, very well respected by his co-workers and making good money.  I&#39;m <br/>\na...  housewife. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;it took<br/>\nhim the better part of 20 years to get past the negative labeling and see<br/>\nhimself for the truly talented individual that he is.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s still not quite over it in some ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; No-one<br/>\non earth is truly &quot;gifted&quot; in everything, thus most people have gifts in one<br/>\narea or another. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know... I have a couple of friends who are way up there on all of <br/>\nGardner&#39;s 7 intelligences, and one even on the nature, #8 of 7 &lt;g&gt;.  I <br/>\nmyself, on the other hand, am greatly lacking in more than one area (not the <br/>\nareas school measured...).<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It was interesting to<br/>\nwatch it play out, as many of these &quot;gifted&quot; people had never dealt with<br/>\nother people as peers in their lives. Many of them had few social and life<br/>\nskills.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if the &quot;gifted&quot; personnel department and management of Microsoft <br/>\nwill figure out that among those thousands of applications are also some <br/>\npeople, like the friends I&#39;m thinking of above, who can score well on tests <br/>\nAND who have inter- and intrapersonal skills, AND physical strength and <br/>\nagility, AND musical talent (and therefor a different kind of creativity), <br/>\nand that hiring well-rounded people would save them a lot of management grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nI (and many of us) could go on and on about the problems of labelling people <br/>\n&quot;gifted,&quot; and those who prefer the setting-apart label could ignore it.  <br/>\nCondescension is a necessary part of that, and to express the wish that it <br/>\nall works out for us comes under that, I think.  Every time a child is told <br/>\nhe&#39;s better than others, a fairy falls down dead.  Not really, but his <br/>\nability to connect with other people who either have scored lower on a test <br/>\n(big deal) or didn&#39;t read early (same on the big-deal scale--do early walkers <br/>\nbecome olympic runners?) or whose parents have chosen to avoid testing and <br/>\nlabelling altogether is impaired further as he is further set apart.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15028,"nextTopicId":15038}}
