I&#39;ve lived in Kansas for all, but about 10 of my 43 <br/>\nyears,  and I&#39;ve only seen one tornado (when I was 10).  We had some <br/>\ndamage a few years ago from a funnel that passed overhead,  but we <br/>\nwere in the basement at the time.  I do consider a basement or storm <br/>\nshelter almost a necessity here - wouldn&#39;t want to live in a mobile <br/>\nhome although some do.  We have a lot of wind here on a daily basis <br/>\neven without any storms.  What we want now is some snow!!!!<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had such a dry, warm fall that our biggest problem has been <br/>\nprairie fires.  People routinely do controlled burns here on <br/>\nfarmland.  It makes the soil richer and does away with the scrubby <br/>\nbrush that tends to take over.  With dry weather like we&#39;ve had,  <br/>\nit&#39;s easy for those burns to get out of control,  so we&#39;ve had some <br/>\nburn bans,  but we&#39;ve still had problems.  We finally got some rain <br/>\nso that should help.  For awhile we could walk out the front door,  <br/>\nsmell fire,  and know that the praire was burning somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane in KS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4991,"nextTopicId":4995}}
