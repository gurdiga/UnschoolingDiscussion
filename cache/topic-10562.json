However, it would not be to my benifit to live closer to my<br/>\nfamily because they don&#39;t parent anywhere near the attachment style I use<br/>\nwith my children.  I have made a community of friends, who parent the same<br/>\nstyle.  I have a sub-culture in my beliefs that offers me support on my <br/>\nworse<br/>\ndays and laugh with me on my best.  I, also, am a facilitator for Attachment<br/>\nParenting International and provide a meeting place for like minded parents,<br/>\nso that they can start making up their own &quot;extended families&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, I couldn&#39;t live near my mother either... that&#39;s why I live 700 miles <br/>\naway! Probably trying to form groups of like-minded friends who can be <br/>\ncounted on the help each other out is a good idea. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always <br/>\npractical, though. People live far apart in cities... and it seems to me <br/>\nthat as soon as I get to know someone and like them really well, they move.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it doesn&#39;t seem to me that you can ever impose on friends the way you <br/>\ncan on your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"pL1R-xaFU9BJXDSXL5jtx7h4hh8-HEw5OIO35zmOdyflJ3-WqbQF8Ur6aAF38nwRSwcP_2JJ8nCr6xjTECaRS-kA5P9myFuIO-w3o2cc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"extended families","postDate":"962744780","msgId":10562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzA0MjEwNjIwLjcyOTE4LnFtYWlsQGhvdG1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10602,"prevInTime":10561,"nextInTime":10563,"topicId":10562,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"David wrote: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-232487067\">David wrote:<br/>\n&lt;Prior to the Regency (50 years before Victoria)<br/>\nand the rise of industrialism, it is true that teenagers were expected to<br/>\nhave babies, and expected to have more responsibility.
