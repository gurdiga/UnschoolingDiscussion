It&#39;s in an American version of an older ballad, The Wife of Usher&#39;s <br/>\nWell:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a lady, a lady so gay<br/>\nAnd she had children three<br/>\nShe sent them away to the north country<br/>\nTo learn their gramaree, to learn their gramaree<br/>\n<br/>\n[and a few verses pass which aren&#39;t all that pleasant,<br/>\nbut she asks God for a miracle...]<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was then Old Christmas Time<br/>\nThe nights were so long and cold<br/>\nShe looked and saw her three little babes<br/>\nCome a-runnin&#39; down the hall...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the SE U.S. the immigrants were Protestant, and they were NOT big on the <br/>\nmiracles or the supernatural, but to distinguish the legal holiday Christmas <br/>\nfrom &quot;REAL&quot; Christmas (when it would have fallen if the calendar hadn&#39;t been <br/>\nadjusted), they said that the difference was that on &quot;Old&quot; Christmas, at <br/>\nmidnight, the animals would kneel and pray.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got off the topic, but if you go to www.google.com you will too!! And it <br/>\nwill be fun!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39715,"nextTopicId":39863}}
