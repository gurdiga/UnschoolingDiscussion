I don&#39;t say <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t listen and is stubborn, instead I say she has her own mind. <br/>\n I have done this since before I had kids, when I was teaching special <br/>\neducation and I called the little retards in my classroom &quot;children that <br/>\nlearn at their own pace.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This doesn&#39;t mean every single<br/>\n&gt; case, to be sure.

I&#39;m sure you raised her in a way that maximized her<br/>\n&gt; potential, but she is also a GIRL, and whether it is sexist to admit <br/>\n&gt; this or not,<br/>\n&gt; girls do mature much more quickly than boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no, not necessarily<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I am speaking of both mental and<br/>\n&gt; verbal maturity.  Trust me, I have a biology degree and I do know some<br/>\n&gt; things. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure you know many things, but this is one area I cannot trust you <br/>\nand will not trust you.  Others on this list have equally impressive <br/>\ndegrees and areas of knowledge, but for the most part I don&#39;t believe a <br/>\ncollege education means very much.  For example some of the best <br/>\nteachers I know have little or no formal education while some of the <br/>\nworst teachers have spent years aquiring this certification or that <br/>\ndegree in education.  I think very few unschoolers would be impressed <br/>\nwith college degrees, but especially those of us who also have college <br/>\ndegrees and understand that they rarely mean gathering of life long <br/>\nlearning and instead measure an ability to play a game.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Boys are relatively &quot;retarded&quot; in these areas, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel sad for your boys, that you feel so.  I don&#39;t have a boy but I <br/>\nwould love one, and I can tell you I don&#39;t think I would ever refer to <br/>\nany part of my boy as retarded.  I know many boys, having taught for <br/>\nyears and years, having three nephews, and being alive and observant in <br/>\nvarious situations, and while I do accept that there are some biological <br/>\ndifferences between boys and girls, I personally think that nurture is <br/>\nso much more important.  I think it&#39;s sad that your boys have a mom who <br/>\nconsider them &quot;retarded&quot; in any area, and it makes me think that often <br/>\nchildren perform to expectations--I did learn that in college but it is <br/>\nsomething that I have seen play out in real life in the classroom and in <br/>\nmy own home, so I think there is something to it.  If a parent expects a <br/>\nchild to be socially retarded, they should not be surprised when that <br/>\nhappens.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, children learn by what they see, based on your words I <br/>\nwonder what kind of modeling you are doing for your own children and <br/>\nwould most definately put a greater emphases on their behavior on that <br/>\nmodeling and on your feelings about boys instead of on the fact they <br/>\nhave a penis.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and yet they tend to be if<br/>\n&gt; anything MORE active at a younger age, so the potential for getting <br/>\n&gt; themselves<br/>\n&gt; into danger should be obvious. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a good friend who almost cried when she realized she was h aving <br/>\na little boy.  She wanted a sweet gentle easy little girl, and was <br/>\nworried about how she&#39;d be able to handle a little boy who would fall <br/>\nout of trees or off walls or who would get into scuffles with friends. <br/>\n We met when our children were about 4 months of age, they are about 1 <br/>\nmonth apart in age.  It was immediately clear that she had a sweet easy <br/>\nlittle boy and I had a high need little girl who was anything but sweet <br/>\nand easy.  Her little boy has never broken anything, never needed <br/>\nstiches or a cast, seldom scrapes his knees.  His quite mature and easy <br/>\ngoing, he could play with small toys very early, as he never put <br/>\nanything in his mouth and was quite mature with both language and fine <br/>\nmotor skills.  Lexie on the other hand has fine motor issues because of <br/>\nher vision issues and she&#39;s a rough and tumble little girl who loves to <br/>\nclimb trees and walk on walls and roll in the grass.  My girls love all <br/>\nanimals and insticts, and have few fears.  I have raised them as sexfree <br/>\nas possible, buying them &quot;boy&quot; toys and &quot;girl&quot; toys and not labeling <br/>\nthose items in any way.  They would push around their trucks in their <br/>\nstrollers and breastfeed their dinosaurs.  Oh, and to answer another <br/>\npost, there were using knifes when they were toddlers as well, with <br/>\nassistance and help, because I personally do not believe that saying <br/>\n&quot;NO!&quot; to those dangerous items works, but instead helping a child learn <br/>\nabout things that can be potentially dangerous so that they can manage <br/>\nthem and know how to deal with various situations helps better.  Janene <br/>\nhas been lighting matches since she was three, as she was facinated with <br/>\nthe candles and it seemed wiser to give her some control over fire and <br/>\nmatches as well as some guidelines regarding those items instead of <br/>\nsimply saying no.  She has burned herself, she knows the power of <br/>\nmatches, and this knowledge has made her powerful, so there is no need <br/>\nfor her to &quot;Play&quot; with matches.  It is interesting but my friend just <br/>\nhad another little boy and she was thrilled now to have a brother for <br/>\nher son.  Her 2nd sone is more like Lexie, definately a strong willed <br/>\nchild who is going to have my friend rethink all of her ideas about <br/>\nlittle boys and little girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And no, it isn&#39;t possible to just talk them<br/>\n&gt; out of it. I don&#39;t think anyone who has only raised girls fully <br/>\n&gt; understands just<br/>\n&gt; how much trouble little boys can get themselves into, things that <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; even occur to the average mom until they happen, because as a general <br/>\n&gt; rule we<br/>\n&gt; just don&#39;t think the way they do! <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What a statement of ignorence.  How can you make a statement?  Amazing. <br/>\n Again, that theory of expectations I think is in play here. But to be <br/>\nhonest, I&#39;m not even sure what to say here.  I&#39;m pretty confident that <br/>\nyou don&#39;t even read what any of us write, at least not with an open <br/>\nmind.  So what is the point of me responding to this horrible sexist <br/>\nstatement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I will say this--why must we call it trouble!  My girls have <br/>\ncertainly gotten themselves into lots of situations, things that <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have occured to me that they might do until afterwards, but I <br/>\ncertainly rarely called it &quot;Trouble&quot; because for me and to me it was a <br/>\nlearning experience.

And they are, but they have still done <br/>\n&gt; some really<br/>\n&gt; stupid, dangerous things, as has their dad, come to think of it, even <br/>\n&gt; though as<br/>\n&gt; an undergraduate he aced such complex things as Physical Chemistry and<br/>\n&gt; Differential Equations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t come to any conclusion other than to just say it must be a guy <br/>\n&gt; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>or maybe it&#39;s an expectation thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LASaliger@aol.com","from":"LASaliger@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MPzU8xnoj16I5jtkJCiQUg-zqhZQTr3ngs9SzEuZ6dAFth4Tlu9bGs47ft_z2U26fWgsPiEyV3Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] sexism","postDate":"987716770","msgId":19250,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlmLjE0NWQ4NjI0LjI4MTBiNmEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19147,"nextInTopic":76904,"prevInTime":19249,"nextInTime":19251,"topicId":19124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/18/01 6:45:31 PM Pacific Daylight Time, lurine@softcom.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1893714303\">In a message dated 4/18/01 6:45:31 PM Pacific Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Some of the songs out there bug me with their messages also.
