You<br/>\nhave to WANT to enjoy it. **<br/>\n<br/>\nI even read a blurb (somewhere) about a scientific study that showed<br/>\nthat making a large fake smile actually causes the release of some of<br/>\nthe same positive chemicals as a real smile.  So, in addition to trying<br/>\nto smile and laugh naturally a lot, sometimes when life is dull, I do<br/>\nthe fake smile thing as an exercise for my face and brain.  (It&#39;s hard<br/>\nto do it without feeling silly.)<br/>\n============================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m catching up on my emails, so I&#39;m just getting this, but I just had to<br/>\ntell how I&#39;ve been doing something similar with my little ones.  When I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting frustrated about some behavior and I&#39;m about to be stern and &quot;fuss&quot;<br/>\nat them, I have been catching myself, and instead smiling at them.  It<br/>\nstarts out fake (since it doesn&#39;t match my frustration), but switches to the<br/>\nreal thing in microseconds, because that smile not only feels good (and<br/>\ngoofy!), but it makes my children smile too!  When I see my children smile,<br/>\nI can&#39;t help but have a real smile to give back.  And I can feel my<br/>\nfrustration melt away and my real feelings of love and compassion come to<br/>\nthe front right away.  It&#39;s an amazing little trick!

The younger one can<br/>\ndo some of the games but gets frustrated by the pen  its a bit touchy;<br/>\nshe also doesnt get the point of most of the games  she just likes<br/>\npushing buttons and having things happen!  The older one played<br/>\nconstantly (literally on at 8am off at 8pm) for about three weeks.  We<br/>\nhave four of the cassettes and he did each one through the various<br/>\nlevels.  Since then, hes barely touched the Leapster :-).  Whenever<br/>\nhes around someone playing with a game boy he gets very excited.  Im<br/>\nnot saying we chose wrongly because Im perfectly happy he got so much<br/>\nenjoyment out of it and if he never picks it up again Ill still feel we<br/>\ngot our moneys worth, but there are limited games available for<br/>\nLeapster and theyre not coming out with new ones very quickly.  On the<br/>\nother hand, many of the multitude of GB games seem a bit too mature to<br/>\nappeal to my naïve 5-y.o.  I think Leapster was a good introduction to<br/>\nhandheld games and using the buttons  its pretty user-friendly and<br/>\ngives feedback if a child keeps pressing the wrong button.  Hope some<br/>\nof this helps you in your decision.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlyson<br/>\n <br/>\nJessie wrote, in part:  So my question is when did your kids start<br/>\nplaying hand <br/>\nhelds and what did they start playing?

It was fun.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow he joyfully takes out garbage, cleans the kitchen and den, helps Duncan  <br/>\nwith Dunc&#39;s room, keeps his own room nearly spotless (better than mine!). He&#39;s <br/>\n cleaned the bathrooms a few times, but really doesn&#39;t like that. He always  <br/>\nempties the dishwasher for me and often does the laundry. Never a complaint or <br/>\na  &quot;do I *have* to?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nTwo years, though. That deschooling time. How long have you nagged?  coerced? <br/>\nbribed? whined? bitched? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some formula! &lt;g&gt; It  may take a <br/>\nlong time, but I think it&#39;s worth it. They need to see (and  hear) you joyfully <br/>\n&quot;doing&quot; for them and for you and for the house.<br/>\n <br/>\nModel joyful cleaning. &quot;The dishes are calling my name!&quot; &quot;The compost says,  <br/>\n&#39;Turn me!&quot; &quot;The kitchen floor needs me right now.&quot; And skip in to do it. (I&#39;m  <br/>\nnot joking!)<br/>\n <br/>\nGlow in what you&#39;ve achieved! Show your pride in what you&#39;ve  <br/>\naccomplished----even if it&#39;s just clean dishes! &quot;Soapy water feels so  good!&quot; &quot;The garden is <br/>\nweed-free and gorgeous!&quot; &quot; You could EAT off that  floor!-----let&#39;s DO it!&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nSay it out LOUD! <br/>\n <br/>\nThe more you do it, the better and easier it gets.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaking it fun only works if you&#39;re making it fun for yourself. Making it  fun <br/>\n*just* to get them to do it for you only makes them resent your stupid  <br/>\nefforts! &lt;g&gt; Like playing a game so they&#39;ll learn math. It needs to be  real. <br/>\nActually take pleasure in what you&#39;re doing. They&#39;ll catch it like a  fever!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99645,"nextTopicId":99654}}
