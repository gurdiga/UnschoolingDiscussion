At one point two snails were shown mating accompanied by opera<br/>\n(pretty incredible sight) and my son asked what they were doing.  I said I<br/>\nthought that they were either dancing or making babies.  I found myself<br/>\nholding my breath as I waited for the next question and there wasn&#39;t one.<br/>\nBut I do think they will probably learn through watching animals since they<br/>\nare so fascinated by anything animal.  You have to borow or rent this movie!<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!!!! That is just too funny. Just now as I was tucking Sierra into bed<br/>\ntonight, she was telling me about these two snails that her and Joseph saw<br/>\nthat were stuck together. She was asking me what they could be doing. I said<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t sure but probably mating. Which led her to mention the FL lovebugs<br/>\nwe all had flying around us last month and then on cycles where animals have<br/>\ncertain times they mate.

At one point two snails were shown mating accompanied by opera (pretty incredible sight) and my son asked what they were doing.  I said I thought that they were either dancing or making babies.  I found myself holding my breath as I waited for the next question and there wasn&#39;t one.  But I do think they will probably learn through watching animals since they are so fascinated by anything animal.  You have to borow or rent this movie!
