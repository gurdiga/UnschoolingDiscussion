C.<br/>\n&gt;      A disturbing question I1m often asked as a health professional is, &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; try to eat right, I take supplements, but I just don1t feel healthy. What<br/>\n&gt; can I do?&quot; We are seeing a dramatic rise in degenerative, chronic and<br/>\n&gt; autoimmune diseases, even in children. Diseases that were once unusual,<br/>\n&gt; such as chronic fatigue, severe allergies, asthma, fibromyalgia, diabetes,<br/>\n&gt; candidiasis, severe digestive disorders and environmental/chemical<br/>\n&gt; sensitivities are becoming common. More people complain of getting<br/>\n&gt; recurring colds, flu and infections. Each generation seems weaker than the<br/>\n&gt; last. With all the nutritional supplements and advances in traditional<br/>\n&gt; medicine, why is this happening?<br/>\n&gt; ....<br/>\n&gt;        Generally, intestinal toxemia manifests as one or more of the<br/>\n&gt; following: fatigue, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset, impaired<br/>\n&gt; nutrition, skin problems, circulatory problems, headaches, arthritis,<br/>\n&gt; sciatica and low back pain, allergy, asthma, eye, ear, nose and throat<br/>\n&gt; disease, heart irregularities, appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable<br/>\n&gt; bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn1s disease, diabetes, psoriasis,<br/>\n&gt; high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and pathological changes<br/>\n&gt; in the breasts. All of these have responded to therapy directed at a<br/>\n&gt; toxemic state in the&#39; intestine.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was just diagnosed with asthma (all 3 of my kids have it too) and my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doctor immediatly started talking about me using an inhaled steroid<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (something my kids have never had to do). Do any of you know of any more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; natural alternatives?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 24<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 29 Jun 2000 19:21:52 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Dia Garland&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moocow@...\">moocow@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: spanking<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to just start out by being very clear to everyone that I am talking<br/>\n&gt; about what we do in ***my*** family here, and I am answering a direct<br/>\n&gt; question, so please do not post nasty messages about being &quot;judgmental&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Got it???<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So if you and I were making a tuna salad together and I told you to get<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mayo and you handed me something else and I said &quot;no I said get me the<br/>\n&gt; mayo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not the butter&quot; and you still didn&#39;t do as I asked it would be ok to spank<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you for disobeying me?  Why is it ok to spank a child but not an adult who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t do what I want them to do?  I&#39;m just interested in the response to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this and let&#39;s leave out &quot;but your not my child and we are equals, because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s not a real argument)  If the argument is that spanking stops<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disobedience then why would children have to be spanked more than once?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First of all, I can&#39;t leave out &quot;you&#39;re not my child&quot; because that is a very<br/>\n&gt; real part of the issue.  It is not my job to train my peers, it is my job to<br/>\n&gt; train my kids.  I guess we could make an analogy to countries that use<br/>\n&gt; physical punishment for criminals,  it is the job of the country to &quot;train&quot;<br/>\n&gt; in a sense the citizens.  Or at least the job of the country to keep the<br/>\n&gt; citizens inline with the laws.  I have lived in a country that practices<br/>\n&gt; physical punishment, and I have to say that there was very little crime<br/>\n&gt; there.  The consequences of sure and swift harsh punishment was a deterrent<br/>\n&gt; to crime.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>\n&gt; them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>\n&gt; along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>\n&gt; difference.  I was abused as a child, so I know full well what beating is.<br/>\n&gt; Spanking is not done because I am angry, but as a consequence for actions.<br/>\n&gt; Beating is done in anger for often unknown reasons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You asked why kids have to be spanked more than once if it stops<br/>\n&gt; disobedience.  We can ask the same thing of any form of correction, can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; we?  Why do you have to put kids in &quot;time out&quot;, ground a teenager, take away<br/>\n&gt; a privilege, or give extra work more than once if these are designed to stop<br/>\n&gt; disobedience?  They have to be done more than once because it is a long job<br/>\n&gt; to teach our children.  Some things they will do once and never again,<br/>\n&gt; others they will do over and over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we work with our calves to teach them to lead, they do not learn about<br/>\n&gt; the halter the fist time we work with them.  It takes a lot of time to teach<br/>\n&gt; them that when the halter is on, they go where we want them to go.  We do it<br/>\n&gt; by making it uncomfortable for them when they stop, and comfortable for them<br/>\n&gt; when they go.  I am not trying to equate children with animals here, just<br/>\n&gt; the concept that it takes time to teach.  Once is not enough.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your posts Dawn!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 25<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Thu, 29 Jun 2000 16:37:27 AKDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Holly Atchison&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HollyAtch@...\">HollyAtch@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Summer unschooling ideas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That sounds like so much fun!
