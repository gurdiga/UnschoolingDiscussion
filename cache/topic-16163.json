Benjamin Disraeli, a 19th-century British Prime<br/>\nMinister, said that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and<br/>\nstatistics. Calumniating falls under Disraeli&#39;s second category. The noun<br/>\nis &quot;calumny.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested Usage: Unfortunately, we find this behavior on all levels:<br/>\n&quot;After a period of scandal, politicians sometimes become more careful<br/>\nabout calumniating their opponents.&quot; &quot;Humans are basically sadistic;<br/>\nwatch how toddlers calumniate their siblings, just to watch the spectacle<br/>\nof the punishment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEtymology: Latin calumnia &quot;trickery, chicanery&quot; from calvor &quot;to deceive.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n\t�Audra Himes, yourDictionary.com<br/>\nSpread the Word:<br/>\nLike what you see?
