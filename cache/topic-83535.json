We have sheep, and <br/>\nbelieve me, using the rod is not always a &quot;gentle&quot; affair.  We don&#39;t hit them in <br/>\nany way, shape, or form, but catching one in the crook of your rod usually <br/>\nmakes them kick, struggle and fight violently (most of them) to try and get free.  <br/>\nLOL!  I wonder what sort of analogy we could make out of that?...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I know that the ones I bottle fed (mom sheep aren&#39;t able to &quot;count&quot; how <br/>\nmany babies they have, and sometimes if they have more than 2 (only 2 teats) <br/>\nthe 3rd will die of starvation) are very tame, sweet, will follow me anywhere. <br/>\n Attachment parenting?  I know we are also always very quiet and calm around <br/>\nthe sheep, and they respond best to gentleness.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy B. in WV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50009731,"authorName":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema","from":"Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;heidi@...&gt;","profile":"heidi_wd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Spare the Rod...","postDate":"1067638595","msgId":83535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4wLjE0LjAuMjAwMzEwMzExMzU5MTIuMDFiNmExYTBAbWFpbC5keWtlbWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNjc2MzczOTQuMjM1Mi45NDg4MS5tMjBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":83658,"prevInTime":83534,"nextInTime":83536,"topicId":83535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
