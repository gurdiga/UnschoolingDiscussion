Families must agree to many guidelines in order to be accepted into the school and continue in it. At the yearly ATI conference, the dress code is nearly a uniform consisting of a white shirt and navy blue pants or skirt. They must follow a dress code while they are homeschooling, and the curriculum itself describes in detail what is required for proper and modest dress and grooming. Beards are not allowed, but an exception is granted to those who have one because of religious conviction. Once in ATI, a family is sent the curriculum on a regular basis. The curriculum consists of 52 Wisdom Booklets, which provide nearly all that is required to complete the education. These booklets make a stack just over a foot high. When a family has completed all the booklets, they start again from the beginning. The curriculum is intended to be used for all ages simultaneously -- K-12.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this fascinating like a big social trainwreck.  What a contrast to the &quot;let children choose&quot; stuff we talk about here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-And from another former Gothardite: &quot;Mr. Gothard does not teach these wonderful truths which will set us free from the power of sin (the law) and to allow the Holy Spirit to empower us to be everything we were meant to be. No! He teaches how to be enslaved to the power and the penalty of sin. There is no freedom of the Spirit to lead in one&#39;s life. Gothard must think he has the blueprint for one&#39;s life. By the time you have &quot;progressed&quot; to the elite &quot;home education&quot; seminar, he will dictate when to get up in the morning, how to dress, what to eat (dietary law), what music to listen to, how to use the TV (never) and the newspaper (let others screen it for you), not to use contraceptives, when to have sex with your mate (based on Levitical law), what colors and styles to use in your dress, how to clean your house, how to check your mail, choice of toys, whether a man should wear a beard or not, how to use your money, how you should worship, how to be cleansed from sin, how to be right with your brothers, friendships, dating, and the list goes on. Gothard&#39;s blueprint is indeed a &quot;how to&quot; religion which gives people no room for personal Christianity. It is a way of controlling and cloning people. What area of life would the Holy Spirit be able to interact with a person under this system? Does Gothard know the mind of God so well that he can dictate so many details in the lives and hearts of God&#39;s people? Wouldn&#39;t this also isolate these people from any truth or added information from sources outside of the Gothard camp? Would it enhance an arrogance of superiority in the body of Christ because no one but Gothard knows God&#39;s way?

The beard issue started my concern (if you have one you are not in submission to God).&quot; Gothard teaches that beards indicate a lack of humility.

Beyond these materials is a large set of notes called Advanced Training Institute of America. In it he teaches on self-image, responsibility, conscience, rights, freedom, success, purpose, friends, engagement, finances, gratefulness, and prayer.
