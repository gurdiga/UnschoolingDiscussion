I&#39;m <br/>\ndealing with the same subject on my local state unschooling list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got done writing a post trying to explain the same thing as <br/>\nabove.   How, if we can get over our own fears and experiences its <br/>\nso much more beneficial for our kids.  If we can get into our kids <br/>\nskins and see the world through their eyes; we can see the <br/>\nwonderfulness all around us.  Not just the violence.  Which is what <br/>\nsome people see when kids want to do certain things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been trying to explain how to see their children&#39;s play as <br/>\nthat, play.  If you stop one line of interest you are really <br/>\nputting up a road block in the your kids&#39; learning.  And I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nsure its probably happening in other places of their lives too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also trying to explain that we really aren&#39;t respecting a <br/>\nchild&#39;s POV if we only see our our own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the discussion started, I began reflecting back. When and how <br/>\ndid my perspective change?  I used to be really uncomfortable with <br/>\nthose things too, all violent play.  Now I&#39;m not? Hmm,  How can I <br/>\nget my point across? What can I say to get them to stop being so <br/>\nfearful?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I guess I decided that it was when some of the moms here said to <br/>\nsit down with your kids.  Do stuff with your kids and see what they <br/>\nare doing.  Why are they enjoying what they are doing?   I think I <br/>\nthen was able to see past my own fears and prejudices.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\neven want my son playing Dragonball Z video games because they were <br/>\nfighting.  I couldn&#39;t see the fact that it was total strategy. Which <br/>\ncombination will beat the other combinations,  and the situations <br/>\nare always changing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts a real shift in perspective-- from our own to theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone else have any suggestions on this?
