She&#39;s always needed quiet alone<br/>\ntime--I truly wonder how life in NYC will affect her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI meant to respond to this part earlier. Maybe she won&#39;t like it or get used<br/>\nto it and come home to you or enjoy visiting you more often than not. That<br/>\nis amazing though that her teacher would do this for her I guess you get<br/>\nwhat you pay for (they are well trained in understanding how to<br/>\nindividualize) I think.. That is also why hs is a good option for kids with<br/>\nsensory integration issues. My son is easily distracted & overstimulated in<br/>\na classroom environment and so am I! Homelife naturally can offer the quiet<br/>\ntime that is forced on kids in ps in a very unatural way (still they aren&#39;t<br/>\nthere to help them in the cafeteria and other places) One reason I let<br/>\nMelissa go to the kindergarten here aside from it being only 2 hours long<br/>\nthe teacher kept the lights low and had art all along the walls and some<br/>\ncosyness to the room. they were allowed to chose and expected to choose<br/>\nactivities on various tables. They were expected to become independent and<br/>\nnot have trouble making choices for a lot of different activities. For my<br/>\nson esp but both kids this much choice overwhelmed them and the teacher<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like that they had so much trouble with it. I used to feel like i was<br/>\na terrible mother that I had somehow made them to dependent on mytelling<br/>\nthem what to do and why couldn&#39;t they just think for them selves and do what<br/>\nthey wanted till I realized this is not true at home and so it must be<br/>\nsomething else aobut the environment that was  intimidating them. Right now<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel like my house is cosy enough for the kids to settle into the<br/>\nway I&#39;d like. We do have a lot of natural lighting though. Winter air is<br/>\nstuffy and I&#39;ve had it with keeping the windows closed here! (Even though I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t taken them out of school yet I have had them home now either from<br/>\nsnow days or sick days so someone is always here lately). Each child still<br/>\nwould work best in their own room for indiviual projects they do enjoy. Do<br/>\nthose with more than one child have a sacred space for reading together as a<br/>\nfamily? I think I need to get away from just reading with mine in their<br/>\nbeds.<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Beth Burnham","from":"&quot;Beth Burnham&quot; &lt;beth2002@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"o8dbqCHsiBk4Ocb6Layug2n52CYlE7NXurf_WMRtikw9U66xVXXNnuqibYccKTQcvUbl5-QngC3Bwmzv80htRpou9cnR8e1zQQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: NYC, Waldorf","postDate":"949415464","msgId":6036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zOTUuNjAzNi45NTkyNjk3NDZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6034,"nextInTopic":6037,"prevInTime":6035,"nextInTime":6037,"topicId":6034,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Susan I think you have me mixed up with Mara.
