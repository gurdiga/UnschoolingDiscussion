I&#39;m so glad to hear from other moms who are working from <br/>\nhome and unschooling and from moms whose partners aren&#39;t fully pro-<br/>\nhome schooling/unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is carol and my daughters, lily, 6 and kit, 4 1/2 are in the <br/>\npublic school&#39;s kindergarten and pre-k programs.  I enrolled them <br/>\nbecause my husband isn&#39;t supportive of unschooling (yet) and the <br/>\nprivate schools i&#39;ve looked at don&#39;t fit.  He was hoping i&#39;d restart <br/>\na career when they were in full-time. (what does it say that if i won <br/>\nthe lottery, the first thing i would do is keep my kids home or start <br/>\na school?)! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband says, let&#39;s try the public school til it fails us - <br/>\nmeaning until the girls get into trouble as teenagers?  I&#39;m telling <br/>\nhim, it already fails me - aside from 10 minutes &quot;table time,&quot; no <br/>\nplay time in kindergarten, too much reprimanding, too much <br/>\nregimentation, testing, etc., etc. - just doesn&#39;t fit my values or <br/>\nworld view. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m following the advice of one of the other mothers who said she <br/>\nleaves articles around the house and i&#39;m working on manifesting even <br/>\nmore abundance in our lives.  I hope to do something creative from <br/>\nhome that the kids might even help with, so thanks Tina for the <br/>\ninspiration!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo glad to find this site, Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Tina Smith &lt;tina@f...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; well i just had to pop in on this discussion...but first let me <br/>\n&gt; introduce myself...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my name is tina and i am mommy to maeven, who will be 5 in november <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; whom i just started loosely homeschooling, tend to lean towards <br/>\n&gt; unschooling and have always had what i consider an enriching <br/>\n </span></blockquote>environment <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at home with lots of books and art supplies available and only <br/>\n&gt; open-ended toys that encourage imaginative play...which i would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>consider <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; an unschooling environment....lots of interesting things to explore <br/>\n </span></blockquote>on <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her time at her own pace... and mommy to baelin, who is our angel <br/>\n </span></blockquote>baby <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; boy, fullterm stillborn. born in april 2004 8lbs 12oz and never <br/>\n </span></blockquote>took a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; breath and no one knows why. and last but not least, tyren (TEAR-<br/>\n </span></blockquote>en), <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our new baby boy who is a little over 2 months old now.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; i am a wahm (work at home mom) in that i have several home <br/>\n </span></blockquote>businesses, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; all of which are online, that i do both for the money (small amount <br/>\n&gt; though it is...but i&#39;m always trying to increase that) and for the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>joy <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they bring me...they are my hobbies and work at the same time. :) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and i am a flylady dropout. :)  i cannot seem to get a grip on my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>house <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and am regularly stressed about it but keep trying. if i can get a <br/>\n&gt; handle of this darn house (not to be perfectly spotless, mind you, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to be free of all the mounds of clutter and dirtiness that we are <br/>\n </span></blockquote>living <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in now that i don&#39;t feel is good for any of us) that my <br/>\n&gt; unschooling/homeschooling will be all the better. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; now about names...you&#39;ve just read my children&#39;s names... maeven, <br/>\n&gt; baelin, tyren....i dared anyone to challenge our names as we came <br/>\n </span></blockquote>up <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with them, lol! we didn&#39;t really run them by my dh&#39;s family because <br/>\n </span></blockquote>i <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; knew they&#39;d think we were weird (they have to think that i&#39;ve just <br/>\n&gt; corrupted their once normal son/brother, lol! i think they think <br/>\n </span></blockquote>i&#39;m <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; this weirdo hippie...heck i think being called a hippie is a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>compliment <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but i am so not a hippie in so many ways...they don&#39;t even know <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hippie is if they call me one, lol!) but my family has always <br/>\n </span></blockquote>supported <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our choices...anyway what cracked me up was when we were thinking <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; names for baelin and my mil told my dh that we shouldn&#39;t pick an <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unusual <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; name because children hate having unusual names because they will <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; picked on.
