I&#39;m often<br/>\ndismayed at people who change their whole way of parenting (hs-ing, etc)<br/>\nbecause of an off hand remark or one person&#39;s story that they&#39;ve heard<br/>\non-line. I really appreciated Hafidha&#39;s story (tho, sadly, I saw some of<br/>\nmy childhood in what she described, and I was sent to school), but I<br/>\nwould urge everyone to not go against their instincts because of one<br/>\nstory, which, by the way, was over-all a positive one! Children are<br/>\ndifferent and so are parents. I don&#39;t think unschooling or parenting the<br/>\nway someone else says to will work. You have to raise your kids the way<br/>\nthat works for you and your family. We can learn by other&#39;s successes<br/>\nand mistakes, and the example of others certainly gives us something to<br/>\nthink about (which is one reason we&#39;re all on this list) but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink we should let ourselves have knee-jerk reactions to other people&#39;s<br/>\nexperiences. Basically, we&#39;re all going to make mistakes. Whether you<br/>\nsend your kids to school, or homeschool, or unschool, there are always<br/>\ngoing to be things you could have done better, and things you could have<br/>\ndone worse. I think we should learn as much as we can from the<br/>\nexperiences of others, take a good, hard look at our own families, and<br/>\nthen do what our instincts tell us to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Amy, I&#39;m really not singling you out. I did notice you said you&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen worried about how it&#39;s going for your family so it&#39;s not just<br/>\nHafidha&#39;s story that is prompting you to make a change. But I have met<br/>\ntoo many people online who read one story from one person and then panic<br/>\nand run out and change everything. I just thought I&#39;d comment on that. <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon CC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"mvvmfv2S1CTqMXps86TzgKVkRN6hlcgWwo9GfWFU1uDCsZzvOt2LJic3zPlQDmFnPFUNOkQkCAzaFBCZ7ENsAh6o","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] from unschool grad","postDate":"955880380","msgId":8168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4Rjk5M0JDLkIzMjBFNDlDQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwYTYwMWJmYTc2MyQyNGJlMTBhMCQ3NzcwM2ZkMUBkZWZhdWx0PiA8MzhGOTZEQTkuOTU2RTc2NUFAaWh1Zy5jby5uej4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8173,"prevInTime":8167,"nextInTime":8169,"topicId":8168,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us, Hafidha.

If things are important enough to us, we will do<br/>\n&gt; them. If they aren&#39;t important enough to do them willingly, then are they<br/>\n&gt; really worth doing?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  Make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sure your kids are really learning and engaged in life - taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lessons, volunteering, getting outdoors, and developing skills;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whether they&#39;re playing an instrument, re-enacting history, sewing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; gardening, working on computers, fixing cars, or flying planes, they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be experiencing things and trying things out. We don&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have these opportunities as adults. (We should, but we don&#39;t.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No matter how many things we offer our kids, even if we have an endless<br/>\n&gt; money supply and endless time and energy available, there will still be<br/>\n&gt; things they don&#39;t get to experience. I think that for many children today<br/>\n&gt; (adults too), who are incredibly busy, what they are really missing out on<br/>\n&gt; is time to reflect, time to dream, time to simply &#39;be&#39;. I&#39;m not trying to be<br/>\n&gt; critical, because I too have seen kids who have very narrow lives and who<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t get to experience a wide enough - IMO - variety in their lives, but I<br/>\n&gt; do think it is important not to swing the other way and burden our kids with<br/>\n&gt; so much &#39;opportunity&#39; that they never get to discover the world within<br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unschooling is only an advantage, I believe, when kids are MORE<br/>\n&gt; &gt; involved in life than they would be if they were in school. And when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they are more in touch with themselves. I was VERY in touch with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself as an unschooling teen, but I wasn&#39;t immersed in life; that was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a very serious inbalance, and seven years later it&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still trying to right.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;d agree with you here, but finding that balance is hard, and it is easy<br/>\n&gt; to react and swing the pendulum too far the other way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  There are so many things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I want to do, that if one thing doesn&#39;t work out it just points me in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; another direction I was interested in anyway.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cool!

So, at the age &gt;of 40, I started taking piano<br/>\n&gt; lessons!  I love it!  I usually &gt;practice about an hour a day and can hardly<br/>\n&gt; walk by the piano &gt;without being drawn to it.  My unschooled daughter, on the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;other hand, has no interest at all AT THIS TIME.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve always wanted to learn piano; my mother, on the other hand, didn&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; much interest in it because she&#39;d had lessons foisted on her from the time she<br/>\n&gt; was a little girl. I&#39;d played viola in elementary school, but there were no<br/>\n&gt; more lessons afterwards. I started taking piano again when I was 17 and it was<br/>\n&gt; available as a class in school. I loved it! I&#39;ve made plans to take it up again<br/>\n&gt; shortly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My point is, learning isn&#39;t something to be accomplished while &gt;you are a child<br/>\n&gt; and then you go live your &quot;real&quot; life.  We are &gt;all &quot;unschooling&quot; from the day<br/>\n&gt; we are born until the day<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we die.  First and foremost, I want my daughter to enjoy &gt;learning and to find<br/>\n&gt; the things in life that bring her joy and &gt;passion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I totally agree!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -Hafidha<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Enjoy the award-winning journalism of The New York Times with<br/>\n&gt; convenient home delivery.
