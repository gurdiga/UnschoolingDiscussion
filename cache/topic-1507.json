Everyone (even the children - though the children are <br/>\nbecoming less and less welcome) sits around watching the body burn, and <br/>\nthen pass the bones around using long chopsticks.  Sorry - I barf at <br/>\nthe sight of roadkill, and can not eat fish with the head still on.  <br/>\nJust the thought of watching a body burn, and then toughing it - even <br/>\nwith a chopstick - is just too much.  But it&#39;s just normal culture <br/>\nhere.  When one of my friends died (she was an older lady), I was kind <br/>\nof sad.  I mean, I was grateful her suffering had ended (she had <br/>\nParkinson&#39;s as well as some other problems), but certainly I&#39;ll miss <br/>\nher.  But others who were even better friends with her than I just <br/>\nshrugged it off - it was just her time.  Then we get into religion - <br/>\nwhich I will not get into on this list.
