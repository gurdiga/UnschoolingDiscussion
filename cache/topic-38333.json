The things she&#39;ll ask for are very specific, things<br/>\nshe&#39;s decided she needs in order to learn what she wants to learn. She<br/>\nasks me to show her how to knit again, or download the lyrics for a song<br/>\nfrom the net, or make sure we&#39;re home at a certain time to watch a show<br/>\non Joan of Arc, or get books on a orphan trains at the library. I think<br/>\nthe idea of coming up to me and saying, &quot;I want to learn French&quot; would<br/>\nnever occur to her, she&#39;d be more likely to come and ask if I knew where<br/>\nthe Rosetta Stone demo CD was, or if we had any books in French, or if we<br/>\nhad any friends who spoke French. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be a personality thing. She&#39;s always been the kind of kid who<br/>\ndecides what she wants and goes about getting it, and trying to guide or<br/>\nsteer her at all is iffy. Even if her plans are unrealistic, she usually<br/>\nhas to discover this for herself before she&#39;ll take much advice from me.<br/>\nOTOH, sometimes things I think are beyond her capabilities turn out to be<br/>\nthings she does quite successfully, so perhaps she&#39;s right to ignore me<br/>\nsometimes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\ndar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4514776,"authorName":"megamom08@aol.com","from":"megamom08@...","profile":"megamom08","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Luz and Ned&#39;s Q&A","postDate":"1024333692","msgId":38381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzLjFmY2YwYjE4LjJhM2Y3MTdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38339,"nextInTopic":38382,"prevInTime":38380,"nextInTime":38382,"topicId":38333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/13/02 1:26:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time, PSoroosh@aol.com ... jumping in this thread a tad late, but one of the first things my daughter ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-134852740\">In a message dated 6/13/02 1:26:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PSoroosh@...\">PSoroosh@...</a> <br/>\nwrites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It will never be algebra or french or social studies or etc<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>jumping in this thread a tad late, but one of the first things my daughter <br/>\nasked to learn was french!!
