I let all the schoolbooks go, and stopped","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-970612118\">I have only started unschooling within the last few months, so before that I was really into teaching him to read.  I let all the schoolbooks go, and stopped pushing it, when I came to my senses about his learning.  Since I have began to relax with everything, he is now able to do things like play on the computer for as long as he likes.  I use to restrict computer time, tv time, game boy time, all time.  I see the errors in my way.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have been checking in with him for more than a month now on the leap pad.  He got 2 new books for it for this Christmas, and did not want to keep them.  We took them back to the store to exchange them for the toys that I also use to restrict.  He has not played with it in months, and, as I write this, I realize that he probably only did because it was something that I did not restrict.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe live in a small house, so I have always worked with him to keep the clutter down to a minimum.  When there gets to be too much stuff, we go thru all the toys and sort them out, so things that he does not want/does not play with go out.  My SIL owns a consignment shop, so the toys go there with the understanding that he gets the money that is earned from the sale of his toys.  The toys go into the garage for a period of time, until I take them to the store.  That way if he changes his mind about something, it is not gone right away.  I can only remember one toy that he has ever asked for back.  They are in an area of the garage that he can see them when he goes out to play in his craft area.  That way he can look at them and tell me if something needs to come back into the house.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWith so much available to him now without restriction, I honestly do not think that he will want to play with this again.  If he changes his mind, we can always pick one up again at the consignment shops.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think he might be learning to read soon?  I think I&#39;d just put that <br/>\nthing away until he is older. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son used that Leappad exactly the way my sons use video games and game <br/>\nsystems.  Once they were through with a game, the system would sit untouched <br/>\nfor weeks, until it happened that they got a new game.  I&#39;ve never gotten rid of <br/>\nthe old game systems, just maybe packed them away or stored them accessibly.  <br/>\nNow all our game systems are in one cabinet with a special TV (FINALLY!), and <br/>\nthose old games get played by someone cycling through here.  My 10 yo is now <br/>\ngetting to the point where he can play some of the games I rather he didn&#39;t <br/>\nplay when he was 3 or 4 (we protected his vivid imagination from scary images <br/>\nwhen he was little--still do) and he doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s on the old Super <br/>\nNintendo.  It&#39;s there to learn from.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh wait, he just reminded me that my 21 yo son took the Super Nintendo to his <br/>\nhouse a few months ago!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if the Leappad was useful to your son, that it probably will be again <br/>\nand he might miss it eventually if you get rid of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

He got it when he was 4 for Christmas, and played with it for spurts nonstop, then would get bored with it and not play with it at all.  When he would get a new book for it, then it would be back to playing with it all the time.  We have recently started unschooling, as opposed to school at home.  I did not use it as an educational tool, just gave him the books and worksheets, and let him play with it as he wanted, and helped him when he asked for it.  As of now, he is done with it and we are getting rid it and all the books.  He has decided that he does not want it anymore, and will not play with it again.  When it got to the books that he had to read, the ones that the system does not read for you, he was done with it.
