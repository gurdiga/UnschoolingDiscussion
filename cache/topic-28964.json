IMO, I&#39;d sit down with him and explain *why* you feel this route is the best for your children. Point out that you&#39;ve done your homework and *know* what you&#39;re doing. Explain in a John Holt sort of way how children learn. Perhaps your dh didn&#39;t enjoy school???? Use that as an example that you don&#39;t want your kids to feel that way, too and that you want them to love learning because it&#39;s a lifelong process, especially in today&#39;s climate where technology is constantly changing. <br/>\nAbout multiplication tables.. my 15.5 yr old dd never formally learned her tables either yet she&#39;s teaching herself Algebra from Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra.  Just understanding what multiplication *is* can go a long way. Now, my dd knows the tables but only because she&#39;s used them over and over again in her use of this book. IMO, Miquan Math is one of the *best* products on the market for showing math concepts over drill and kill methods. It&#39;s for the younger set, though... not teens.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 11:30 AM 29/11/01 -0600, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;I&#39;m a newbie here and am coming out of lurking mode to chime in.

Any attempt at explanations or anything <br/>\nwould have him getting all worked up.  &quot;I just don&#39;t get it!&quot;  After <br/>\nseveral months, one night he pulled a math book off the shelf.  His mother <br/>\nkept her mouth shut.  He opened the book to the middle and started <br/>\nin.  Pretty soon his mother heard the familiar, &quot;I just don&#39;t get <br/>\nit!&quot;  Again she kept her mouth shut.  After a while, he turned to the <br/>\nbeginning and began working.  He got through about half the book that <br/>\nnight.  He worked at it off and on for a few weeks and then stopped.  A few <br/>\nweeks later, I visited and heard the latest math news.  He had started a <br/>\nproject of doubling numbers.  1+1+2, 2+2+4, etc.  This was all on his <br/>\nown.  He had to ask his mother what came after trillions and they had to <br/>\nlook up together what came after quadrillions.  He stopped somewhere in the <br/>\nquintillions!
