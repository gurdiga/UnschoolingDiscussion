She didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to stay home longer, because noises in the house would start to frighten <br/>\nher.  She is getting better though.  My 14 year old was staying home for long <br/>\nperiods at age 12, even at night.<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t bother him at all, but one of my oldest, when he was 12, got <br/>\nterrified at night.<br/>\nOne time he wanted to stay home by himself while the rest of us went out.  <br/>\nWhen we got home, he was sitting outside with our dog.  He was so scared of <br/>\nthe noises in the house, and we live out in the country, so he was scared <br/>\noutside as well.  He used our dog for protection.  Now he looks back at that <br/>\nand laughs.  LOL<br/>\n    To me it depends on the child.  When they were mature enough to take care <br/>\nof themselves, I considered them ready.  But I also wanted to make sure that <br/>\nbeing home alone didn&#39;t scare them (I remember my parents leaving me home, <br/>\nwhen I was sick, and they went to work.  I stayed under their bed terrified <br/>\nthe whole time.  I don&#39;t remember my age, but I didn&#39;t want that to happen to <br/>\nmy kids).  Usually, I would start with small periods (run to the store for <br/>\nmilk etc) and then if they did ok, leave them for longer periods of time.<br/>\nTammy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How old is he?

It&#39;s called <br/>\n_Disaster Blasters_ by Laura Szabo Cohen and Karin Kasdin.  It&#39;s a book about <br/>\nwhat to do if you&#39;re home alone and certain things happen, like the commode <br/>\noverflows or something.  It&#39;s very funny and informative.  Some of you might <br/>\nremember Laura from the old AOL boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older children where in school for 6 or 7 years and I worked full-time.  <br/>\nStarting at age 10 of the oldest, they were home alone for an hour and half <br/>\nevery day after school (latch-key children!).  I regret that all now, even <br/>\nthough nothing bad ever happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 9 yo now, and I wouldn&#39;t leave him home alone at 10 or 11.  But <br/>\nthen, he&#39;s *alone* with no siblings at all.  He has asked me to do it a lot <br/>\nof times, but there&#39;s no way I would.  Maybe about 12.  Perhaps in the next <br/>\ncouple of years I might run up to the store and to get a paper or something, <br/>\nleaving him tucked in bed or something.  But not for an extended time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often leave him early in the morning, sleeping, while his teenage brother <br/>\nis sleeping in the next room.  The teenager always knows I&#39;m leaving, but the <br/>\n9 yo usually doesn&#39;t.  He has been known to get out of bed, turn on the TV <br/>\nand settle in while I&#39;m gone and not even realize that I&#39;m gone.  Sometimes <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t even know if the teenager is home.  I think he&#39;d be okay staying <br/>\nhome alone for an hour right now, but I&#39;m not okay with it.  I would worry <br/>\nabout the house burning down or something.  (He hasn&#39;t read Disaster <br/>\nBlasters, yet!  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re working full-time and trying to make ends meet, those fears and <br/>\nworries tend to scab over and you don&#39;t feel them as strongly.  That&#39;s how I <br/>\nwas able to do it when my olders were young.  That&#39;s the only way I can <br/>\nexplain it.  I wouldn&#39;t do it now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128307542,"authorName":"Earthmomma67@aol.com","from":"Earthmomma67@...","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] When the kids don&#39;t seem to need you...and other con...","postDate":"1036618065","msgId":49235,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOS4xYThlYTU4Ni4yYWZhZTM1MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49266,"prevInTime":49234,"nextInTime":49236,"topicId":49235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How old is Dillon again?
