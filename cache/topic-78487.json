For my daughters, I use a filter that<br/>\nonly allows email from addresses that I put in.  If someone that is not on<br/>\nthe list wants to email her, I get their address and add them.  It&#39;s that<br/>\nsimple.  I do not allow them to use their email address for anything on the<br/>\nweb.  I have a dummy address that we use only for freebies and such.  They<br/>\ncan use this address too.  That way their address isn&#39;t on the web for spam.<br/>\n You may need to ditch the email address and start fresh.\r<br/>\nPeace,\r<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78480,"nextTopicId":78301}}
