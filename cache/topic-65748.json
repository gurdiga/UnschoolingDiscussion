Your comments and concerns sound a lot <br/>\nlike mine. In feeling it out, this unschooling method, I&#39;ve done some <br/>\nreading in the past few months, and spent some time at a website <br/>\nwhere the Sudbury school is explored. <br/>\n<br/>\nI first read about Sudbury via John Gatto&#39;s writings, and found them <br/>\nthrough a google search. On that page is a Discuss Sudbury Model <br/>\nemail list, not very active on a daily basis, but lots and lots of <br/>\ngood stuff about the unschooling idea. There&#39;s also a link somewhere <br/>\nin there under free texts, where an alumnus of Sudbury tells of his <br/>\nexperience at the school. Mind you, this is a place where there is <br/>\nZERO formal instruction. Kids are free to spend their time just <br/>\nexactly as they see fit: a lake on the property, helping adults <br/>\nrefurbish a barn or cook lunch, or doing those independent of adult <br/>\ninteraction, playing video games all day. Nothing is &quot;taught&quot; there <br/>\nas a subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the article that I&#39;m thinking of describes how a boy got <br/>\ninterested in Algebra. this is the link to those alumni articles <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sudval.org/texts/kingdom.html\">http://www.sudval.org/texts/kingdom.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the first article, number 11, and I found it fascinating and <br/>\nhope engendering: the kid got an interest in nuclear science by some <br/>\nreading, and found he couldn&#39;t understand most of what he read, <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t know algebra. And so...he taught it to himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend reading the stuff at the Sudbury page. Articles by <br/>\nthe students, by the teachers. They have a lengthy track record of <br/>\nturning out literate, numerate, confident individuals, without any <br/>\nexternal pressure of any sort.

Yep, that week it was a big <br/>\ndeal to me, I just had a trusted friend, who the principal of the local high <br/>\nschool tell me what a disservice I was doing for Cait by not exposing her to <br/>\nmath right now.  That it was a layers thing and had to built on layer by <br/>\nlayer and not all learned at once.  I panicked, it happens.  I KNEW I surely <br/>\nwasn&#39;t exposing her to ANY math.  Of course she WOULD need it at some point.  <br/>\nSo I asked the &quot;experts&quot; that I knew who&#39;ve been on this journey longer than <br/>\nI.  I got lots of answers and it helped.

One thing that really helped my son is that he sat with me as I read<br/>\naloud and edited my own chapters. He loved hearing me read my writing out<br/>\nloud, but even more importantly it freed him to just start writing his own<br/>\nstuff without worry so much about it being perfect (he tends to be a<br/>\nperfectionist). He would ask me why I was crossing out and changing so many<br/>\nthings, and I explained about the revision process. After doing that with<br/>\nme, his own writing just took off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny new thing looks really, really hard when you first start out. And if you<br/>\nsee people who are already doing it well, it can seem like it just came<br/>\neasily to them. I think it&#39;s really helpful for kids to see adults learning<br/>\nnew things, struggling, making mistakes, starting over, failing, falling<br/>\ndown and getting back up. It lets them know that things don&#39;t come easily<br/>\nfor either, even though we are big and may seem more competent at<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8226888,"authorName":"Robin Clevenger","from":"&quot;Robin Clevenger&quot; &lt;diamondair@...&gt;","profile":"the_clevengers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and holding back","postDate":"1051317078","msgId":65828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTMtREFWMTM3NFpuZUF6ZGYwMDA2MzBkZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTEyOTYxNzQuMzgxNC45OTgyNS5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65815,"nextInTopic":65829,"prevInTime":65827,"nextInTime":65829,"topicId":65748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And the questions you&#39;ve asked about those are in the vein of<br/>\nmaking sure your kids will learn these things. You&#39;re still stuck in the<br/>\nthinking that these things are artificial. That they don&#39;t serve a purpose<br/>\nin a child&#39;s real life so they need to be taught.

Would you be concerned about &quot;pushing&quot; Egypt on them? What would<br/>\nthat look like? It would look like you thought there were important things<br/>\nthey needed to know and you didn&#39;t trust that life was enough to give it to<br/>\nthem.

Do I do <br/>\n  anything, will it come on its own?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Laura<br/>\n<br/>\n  My experience here is that it will come on its own. My 11 year old likes to write letters to his uncle who is in jail. He has always spelled with the sounds like system. When I i,n our early years at home, would suggest helping etc.. he too would lose interest. I shut up real quick and just explained to his uncle in my own letter that I would interpret later if he needed but that Kieran spelled this way and just read it as it sounds. He got it easily and did not need me to interpret.<br/>\n  I was never criticised and even if I had been I did not care because my son was loving the relationship with his uncle and that could easily have been destroyed by my worrying what others thought of me. Now he has become interested in spelling and will occassionally ask for help. <br/>\n  My older children who are 12 almost 13 and 14 almost 15 still are working on spelling. My almost 15 year old is all of the sudden spelling with great clarity and speed so it will happen.<br/>\n  Maureen<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Like some how we <br/>\nshould expose our children to this so they at least have a concept that there <br/>\nis a standard way of writing that includes things like capital letters, <br/>\npunctuations and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been finding myself holding back sharing things with my daughter because <br/>\nI want to be &quot;true&quot; to unschooling but at the same time torn because if I <br/>\ndon&#39;t bring it up or somehow expose her, she has no idea it even exists, let <br/>\nalone want to incorporate it into her being.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike unschooling, I didn&#39;t even know it existed so how could I possibly have <br/>\nknown I wanted it for my children?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what to do?  Quietly &quot;correct&quot; the letter?  Hmmm seems wrong.  Point out <br/>\nthe capitalizations and punctuations in a non judgemental way?  Probably <br/>\nwrong too.  Send off the letter with the poor grammer and let someone else <br/>\nwonder what in the world this child could possibly be learning?  Probably the <br/>\nonly solution...<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we have to give up on those preconcieved notions that we want our <br/>\nchildren to appear to be learned and articulate and social and wonderful and <br/>\nall of that and just let them be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then my ever burning question about HOW do they find this if they are not <br/>\nexposed?  Do we ever point out how books have certain punctuations?  Do we <br/>\njust let them one day ask about it and think it&#39;s only for books?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh Lord, I see the eyes rolling right now... Glena is ASKING QUESTIONS AGAIN!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, I&#39;m leaving for a romantic weekend in the mountains in a few hours <br/>\nso I won&#39;t be asking and following up and trying to LEARN a new unschooling <br/>\ntask this weekend.

His Vocabulary knowledge is <br/>\nadvanced (maybe cuz he was home with Me)? His reading comprehension to <br/>\nhimself is advanced but once he reads aloud his numbers dipped to at least 2 <br/>\nyears behind and couldn&#39;t remember what he read. I guess I attribute this to <br/>\nbeing teased in school, I don&#39;t know?<br/>\nGosh, I almost feel like I am taking credit on the good stuff and blaming the <br/>\nschool for the bad. Shame on me!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beginning of this year I was testing his spelling it was a huge stress <br/>\nall the way around so I stopped. When I went back 2 months later he knew how <br/>\nto spell the words without the practice or book work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis writing is almost unreadable. When I offer to sit with him and work on <br/>\nthese he runs and says ahh, I just remembered I need to go rake the leaves or <br/>\nsomething to the effect. Too funny! You know its not him either its me and my <br/>\npanics over how he will favor in years to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis other areas are great. He knows some HTML, web pages, how to sell, <br/>\ncustomer service, he is polite to others, loves history, shoots archery and <br/>\nguns with precision. He loves surfing,xbox,trampoline jumping with Mom (too <br/>\nfunny cuz im out of shape after baby) He likes to build, incubated chicks <br/>\nlast year, cared for someone chickens for a year and is now training our <br/>\nBrittany.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is, in an Unschooling life how do I help him?
