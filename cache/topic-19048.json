The catalogue <br/>\nused to say (at least for the last three years):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Though we believe we ought to capitalize on our children&#39;s <br/>\ninquisitive natures ... we do not adopt the philosophy most <br/>\n&#39;unschoolers&#39; seem to prefer.  As we said before, we believe we have <br/>\na responsibility before God to help our children acquire the maximum <br/>\nknowledge possible while they are young, under our care, and have the <br/>\ntime. ... We require them to study and practice certain skills or <br/>\nbehaviors even though they don&#39;t think it is fun, fulfilling or <br/>\nprofitable.  We try, always, to explain why we are convinced that <br/>\nthis unpleasant task is profitable.  But whether the child is <br/>\nconvinced or not, we believe that, as parents, we must take the lead <br/>\nand guide our children to maximal achievement.&quot; [Italics mine]<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it says:  &quot;Sonlight is structured .... That doesn&#39;t mean you are <br/>\nunder obligation to the structure. ... But if you are committed to a <br/>\nspontaneous lifestyle, or an educational philosophy that dictates you<br/>\nfollow your child&#39;s heart interests, you may find you have to &quot;buck <br/>\n[our] system&quot; more than you&#39;d prefer in order to maintain your sense <br/>\nof spontaneity. ... Several unschoolers have told us they think we <br/>\nfit right in with what they want to do:  we give them the books, they <br/>\nwork our structure around their interests and inspiration. ... Still, <br/>\nif you are committed to go with the flow and prefer not having to <br/>\n&#39;check yourself&#39; against someone else&#39;s plan, we fully understand. <br/>\nWhile you may enjoy buying many of our books, you will want to <br/>\nproceed with caution when you consider the possibility of purchasing <br/>\na Sonlight Curriculum Basic program.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the link to John&#39;s site:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sonlight.com/\">http://www.sonlight.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18799,"nextTopicId":19051}}
