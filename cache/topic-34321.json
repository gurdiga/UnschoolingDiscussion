If you asked questions, you&#39;d be more likely to get <br/>\n  honest but reasoned responses.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Even people who don&#39;t like the idea of unschooling and have no interest in <br/>\n  doing it themselves sometimes like to hang out with unschoolers because <br/>\n  unschoolers tend to be passionate and interesting (if sometimes rather <br/>\n  contentious) people who have LOTS of ideas. Unschoolers don&#39;t usually mind <br/>\n  other homeschoolers hangin&#39; out with them but don&#39;t like to have to defend <br/>\n  themselves and justify their unschooling and can be pretty sensitive to <br/>\n  insinuations that they are depriving their children of an adequate education <br/>\n  or are lazy, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling, working<br/>\n </span></blockquote>    only on their own initiative and only with their own direction.

The 17 yo has completed <br/>\n  60-something units and has a 3.8+ grade point average.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;My own child, without telling her how I felt about it, asked me first what <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  I thought of unschooling (we&#39;ve checked out some information together.)  She <br/>\n  felt like it wasn&#39;t what she would want to do.  She said she likes it when I <br/>\n  teach her things because I&#39;m smart and I know about a lot of stuff she wants <br/>\n  to learn.  I know that some of you will read this and think I controlled her <br/>\n  into saying this.  Doesn&#39;t matter to me because ultimately we are all <br/>\n  accountable for our own responsibility that God entrusted to us when he gave <br/>\n  us these precious gifts: our children.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think you controlled her into saying it - I think she probably can&#39;t <br/>\n  envision how it would work, though. It is HARD to really catch that <br/>\n  &quot;unschooling vision.&quot; It is SO different than the way we&#39;ve always thought <br/>\n  about learning. For example, the idea that she would be prevented from <br/>\n  learning what she needs to learn to go to vet school is wrong. Truth is, if <br/>\n  she has a goal of vet school and knows that she needs to study certain <br/>\n  subjects to make that happen, then that is exactly what an unschooling kid <br/>\n  would do. And they&#39;d get help from parents and other adults to teach them or <br/>\n  help them get the resources they need to learn what they need to learn to <br/>\n  achieve their goals. Parents don&#39;t sit back and do NOTHING. They pay close <br/>\n  attention and interact and discuss and offer resources and information and <br/>\n  help and support.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It also sounds like she didn&#39;t think you could &quot;teach&quot; her anything if she <br/>\n  unschooled.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Just to help clarify that unschooling parents and other adults and other kids <br/>\n  often &quot;teach&quot; things, my kids and I spent well over an hour today with me <br/>\n  explaining our political system to them - in greater detail than we&#39;ve ever <br/>\n  done before - and they asked a lot of questions and I answered the best I <br/>\n  could and then came home and got on the internet and looked up more answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And, my younger two kids and I went out to breakfast and we sat there for <br/>\n  over an hour talking about probability theory -- starting with one daughter <br/>\n  pondering how to figure out the probability that you&#39;d roll five dice and get <br/>\n  the same number on all of them (we&#39;d been playing Yahtzee earlier). I&#39;m a <br/>\n  statistician and I taught them all about probability, writing on napkins, and <br/>\n  then we moved on to hypothesis testing and got well into stuff that I teach <br/>\n  my college students. They were interested - I wouldn&#39;t have kept going if <br/>\n  they weren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The difference is that I didn&#39;t plan this in advance - today wasn&#39;t scheduled <br/>\n  as the day for government and statistics lessons. It was scheduled as &quot;go out <br/>\n  to breakfast and talk about whatever comes up&quot; day &lt;G&gt;. And there won&#39;t be <br/>\n  any test. What they got out of it, they got. It&#39;ll add up with other stuff <br/>\n  they learn and they&#39;ll continue to amaze me with how well they connect things <br/>\n  and integrate new ideas. My daughter taught ME something today too -- she <br/>\n  gave me a nice lecture about Pluto and the debate about whether it ought to <br/>\n  be classified as a planet or asteroid. She knew a LOT and I had never even <br/>\n  heard of the debate. I also looked that up when we got home and her facts <br/>\n  were correct - there is stuff all over the internet about it, but I just had <br/>\n  never noticed. Teaching happens! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;I wish you and your children well in unschooling, just as I would think<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  that the people here who can &quot;trust the children to do the learning&quot; can also <br/>\n  trust other parents to provide an excellent education by homeschooling and <br/>\n  wish me well also.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wish everybody well. Honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;I sense though, after being onlist here for the time I  have been, that the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  posters I have read really don&#39;t believe my girl will get an excellent <br/>\n  education, that she will be  damaged in self-esteem and be robbed of a love <br/>\n  of learning, and that is sad.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kristine, if we didn&#39;t think unschooling was better, we&#39;d do what we DID <br/>\n  think was better, wouldn&#39;t we? You think your way is better, so you&#39;re going <br/>\n  to do that, right? Although this is a list where you&#39;re going to hear <br/>\n  unschooling defended, I&#39;m sure that there are people who think unschooling is <br/>\n  damaging our kids. Someone just TODAY told me they thought that unschooled <br/>\n  kids don&#39;t learn to take direction from others and that that will hurt them <br/>\n  in the future. I don&#39;t agree, obviously, but that&#39;s their opinion. It can be <br/>\n  discomfitting to read other peoples&#39; negative opinions about what we choose <br/>\n  to do, but there will always be people who disagree with our choices and it <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t hurt us to give them some consideration even if we continue to feel <br/>\n  confident moving in our own different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for Big<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  Brother  to step in and become the only way for all of us, even if it is <br/>\n  against<br/>\n  the  will of some of us.  That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t entirely follow this - I mean, no unschooler thinks unschooling is <br/>\n  the only way - we see other ways all around us all the time. Also, forcing <br/>\n  people to unschool against their will is a contradiction in terms. Can&#39;t be <br/>\n  done. If you meant that we might think it is the only RIGHT way - that is a <br/>\n  trickier question. For me, it isn&#39;t a matter of what is right or wrong, but <br/>\n  that I think unschooling is more in line with the nature of how most children <br/>\n  would learn best IF they started early and if the parents could handle it. <br/>\n  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic for most families and I would not say that <br/>\n  unschooling is the best way for everyone. What I would say is simply that it <br/>\n  is possible - that nobody HAS to do &quot;school-at-home&quot; if they don&#39;t want to. <br/>\n  It is possible to NOT do schoolish stuff and the kids can still live <br/>\n  wonderful, learning, enriched, stimulating lives and they can go on to become <br/>\n  happy, competent adults and achieve success in ANY way they define it <br/>\n  (including going to college and professional schools, etc, if that is their <br/>\n  goal). Nothing is ruled OUT by unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n  --pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

It is HARD to really catch that <br/>\n&quot;unschooling vision.&quot; It is SO different than the way we&#39;ve always thought <br/>\nabout learning. For example, the idea that she would be prevented from <br/>\nlearning what she needs to learn to go to vet school is wrong. Truth is, if <br/>\nshe has a goal of vet school and knows that she needs to study certain <br/>\nsubjects to make that happen, then that is exactly what an unschooling kid <br/>\nwould do. And they&#39;d get help from parents and other adults to teach them or <br/>\nhelp them get the resources they need to learn what they need to learn to <br/>\nachieve their goals. Parents don&#39;t sit back and do NOTHING. They pay close <br/>\nattention and interact and discuss and offer resources and information and <br/>\nhelp and support.<br/>\n<br/>\n It also sounds like she didn&#39;t think you could &quot;teach&quot; her anything if she <br/>\nunschooled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust to help clarify that unschooling parents and other adults and other kids <br/>\noften &quot;teach&quot; things, my kids and I spent well over an hour today with me <br/>\nexplaining our political system to them - in greater detail than we&#39;ve ever <br/>\ndone before - and they asked a lot of questions and I answered the best I <br/>\ncould and then came home and got on the internet and looked up more answers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my younger two kids and I went out to breakfast and we sat there for <br/>\nover an hour talking about probability theory -- starting with one daughter <br/>\npondering how to figure out the probability that you&#39;d roll five dice and get <br/>\nthe same number on all of them (we&#39;d been playing Yahtzee earlier). I&#39;m a <br/>\nstatistician and I taught them all about probability, writing on napkins, and <br/>\nthen we moved on to hypothesis testing and got well into stuff that I teach <br/>\nmy college students. They were interested - I wouldn&#39;t have kept going if <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that I didn&#39;t plan this in advance - today wasn&#39;t scheduled <br/>\nas the day for government and statistics lessons. It was scheduled as &quot;go out <br/>\nto breakfast and talk about whatever comes up&quot; day &lt;G&gt;. And there won&#39;t be <br/>\nany test. What they got out of it, they got. It&#39;ll add up with other stuff <br/>\nthey learn and they&#39;ll continue to amaze me with how well they connect things <br/>\nand integrate new ideas. My daughter taught ME something today too -- she <br/>\ngave me a nice lecture about Pluto and the debate about whether it ought to <br/>\nbe classified as a planet or asteroid. She knew a LOT and I had never even <br/>\nheard of the debate. I also looked that up when we got home and her facts <br/>\nwere correct - there is stuff all over the internet about it, but I just had <br/>\nnever noticed. Teaching happens! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I wish you and your children well in unschooling, just as I would think<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that the people here who can &quot;trust the children to do the learning&quot; can also <br/>\ntrust other parents to provide an excellent education by homeschooling and <br/>\nwish me well also.  &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish everybody well.

You think your way is better, so you&#39;re going <br/>\nto do that, right? Although this is a list where you&#39;re going to hear <br/>\nunschooling defended, I&#39;m sure that there are people who think unschooling is <br/>\ndamaging our kids. Someone just TODAY told me they thought that unschooled <br/>\nkids don&#39;t learn to take direction from others and that that will hurt them <br/>\nin the future. I don&#39;t agree, obviously, but that&#39;s their opinion. It can be <br/>\ndiscomfitting to read other peoples&#39; negative opinions about what we choose <br/>\nto do, but there will always be people who disagree with our choices and it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hurt us to give them some consideration even if we continue to feel <br/>\nconfident moving in our own different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;When we think that our way is the only way then we leave room for Big<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Brother  to step in and become the only way for all of us, even if it is <br/>\nagainst<br/>\nthe  will of some of us.  That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t entirely follow this - I mean, no unschooler thinks unschooling is <br/>\nthe only way - we see other ways all around us all the time. Also, forcing <br/>\npeople to unschool against their will is a contradiction in terms. Can&#39;t be <br/>\ndone. If you meant that we might think it is the only RIGHT way - that is a <br/>\ntrickier question. For me, it isn&#39;t a matter of what is right or wrong, but <br/>\nthat I think unschooling is more in line with the nature of how most children <br/>\nwould learn best IF they started early and if the parents could handle it. <br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think that&#39;s realistic for most families and I would not say that <br/>\nunschooling is the best way for everyone. What I would say is simply that it <br/>\nis possible - that nobody HAS to do &quot;school-at-home&quot; if they don&#39;t want to. <br/>\nIt is possible to NOT do schoolish stuff and the kids can still live <br/>\nwonderful, learning, enriched, stimulating lives and they can go on to become <br/>\nhappy, competent adults and achieve success in ANY way they define it <br/>\n(including going to college and professional schools, etc, if that is their <br/>\ngoal). Nothing is ruled OUT by unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69718075,"authorName":"Joan Wilson","from":"&quot;Joan Wilson&quot; &lt;jroselady@...&gt;","profile":"jroselady","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Not an unschooler =)","postDate":"1018425955","msgId":34330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhORU1JTlBBQ0FJTkRMQkdKTUNBT0VDS0NEQUEuanJvc2VsYWR5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMjcwZDA2NDcuMjllNTE4OTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34326,"nextInTopic":34332,"prevInTime":34329,"nextInTime":34331,"topicId":34321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Kristine: I believe the way you and your daughter are seeing to her education is right for you and her.

That, to me, is public school in a nutshell.  <br/>\nKristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77610158,"authorName":"Bonni Sollars","from":"Bonni Sollars &lt;BSOLLARS@...&gt;","profile":"truuluvv","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Not an unschooler =)","postDate":"1018407366","msgId":34326,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNDA5LjIyNTYxMy4tMTc5MTg5LjE1LmJzb2xsYXJzQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34324,"nextInTopic":34330,"prevInTime":34325,"nextInTime":34327,"topicId":34321,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She said she likes it when I teach her things because I m smart and I know about a lot of stuff she wants to learn.

I think if we present information or<br/>\na topic, but they aren&#39;t interested, and we force it, then it&#39;s not<br/>\nunschooling.  If they come to us seeking knowledge about an area, and we<br/>\nknow something about it and talk about it with them and show them what we<br/>\nknow and refer them to outside sources, I would call that unschooling.  I<br/>\ndo not think requiring them to do it on a daily basis at a certain time<br/>\nis unschooling.<br/>\nTextbooks can be a great learning tool.  My boys use math textbooks. <br/>\nBecause they are interested in it.  But when they don&#39;t feel like it,<br/>\nthey aren&#39;t reprimanded or lectured.  I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; it the way they do<br/>\nin school with practice sets and problems and speed drills.  But if they<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand something it says and come to me for help, I teach in<br/>\nthe sense that I guide them in a way that helps them to understand what<br/>\nit is saying.  Mostly, they just come up with stuff I would never think<br/>\nthey would think of, and it leads us to search out more information on<br/>\nit.<br/>\nI&#39;m not that smart and I can&#39;t teach my kids about veterinary stuff.  But<br/>\nI do know a vet who would allow my child to hang out and help at his<br/>\nclinic.  He was a friend of my dad.  Hands on is so much more interesting<br/>\nthan books, at least for some children.  It depends how much the child<br/>\nlikes to read, I suppose.  (I love books, but my son would probably<br/>\nprefer hands on-why not both?)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I didn&#39;t realize that the kids ran the whole show in unschooling,<br/>\nworking <br/>\nonly on their own initiative and only with their own direction. Boy it<br/>\nsure <br/>\nwould be appealling to my lazy side because I wouldn&#39;t have to do hardly <br/>\nanything!&quot;<br/>\nFirst of all, it is about the child taking charge of their own education,<br/>\nbut it is not about work, it is about passion.  If we have a job we love<br/>\nand feel called to do, it does not feel like work, but like fun.  It is<br/>\nthe same for a child who is pursuing his interests.  As for being lazy,<br/>\nhow is it lazy to take time to listen to a child and help them to pursue<br/>\ntheir interests, or allow them the time to finish studying or reading the<br/>\nsubject that pleases them without saying time to stop before they are<br/>\nready.  I find it takes a lot of energy, and is in fact now a way of life<br/>\nfor me to be so focused on my children.<br/>\n&quot;After being on this list for a couple of weeks I see that my parental <br/>\nphilosophy is very much in conflict with unschooling.  It would be<br/>\nuseless <br/>\nfor me to state my feelings or beliefs here and, as said before by<br/>\nsomeone <br/>\nelse the other day, it isn&#39;t allowed or appreciated.&quot;<br/>\nOnly two weeks?  Why wouldn&#39;t your beliefs be allowed?  Just because<br/>\nsomeone else doesn&#39;t agree doesn&#39;t mean your opinion is not valid.  We<br/>\nall have our reasons for doing what we do how we do it.  Maybe someone<br/>\nhere would have an idea you&#39;ve never really considered before.  If we<br/>\nwere all shy of offending others with our views, no one would get any new<br/>\ninformation.  Sometimes our beliefs have to be challenged for us to<br/>\nreally understand why we are doing things the way we are.<br/>\n&quot;ultimately we are all accountable for our own responsibility that God<br/>\nentrusted to us when he gave us these precious gifts: our children.&quot;<br/>\nI certainly agree with you there.  When I first came to this group, I<br/>\nsort of felt the same way.  Everyone, it seemed, was fighting about what<br/>\nwas and wasn&#39;t unschooling.  It really turned me off to the concept, even<br/>\nthough I had read some books that intrigued me. However, after<br/>\nhomeschooling a while, I realized that the principles of unschooling made<br/>\nsense and came to believe they were actually right for my children and<br/>\nme.  I came back because I couldn&#39;t get enough dialogues on the other<br/>\ngroups to supply me with the kind of info I was looking for.  I talked to<br/>\nmy children about the ideas I was hearing, and they identified with them.<br/>\n These principles made sense to me according to the Bible, and opened my<br/>\neyes to completely new ways of raising my family.  I feel that I am more<br/>\nof a Christian in the way I relate to my children now than ever before. <br/>\nAnd all as a result of what I&#39;ve learned from unschooling.  One thing<br/>\nI&#39;ve come to learn is that God exposes me to different ideas and concepts<br/>\nand expects me to give them more than a cursory glance before making up<br/>\nmy mind.  I have tested this unschooling method by scripture and it has<br/>\nbeen found weighty and true.  I have noticed scriptures that never meant<br/>\nthat much to me before, but now clearly reflect unschooling ideas.  One<br/>\nof them is how to teach your children.  While sitting with them, walking<br/>\nwith them, etc.  One of them is how Jesus taught his disciples, while<br/>\nwalking, while eating, while visiting, etc.<br/>\nAnyway,sorry you feel this way.  I wish you and your daughter the best of<br/>\neverything.  God bless.<br/>\nBonni<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18130,"nextTopicId":102661}}
