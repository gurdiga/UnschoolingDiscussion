The moderator is new to the<br/>\njob and is a very pleasant person but is still teaching and wants to see<br/>\nlots of paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not due to see him till later on in the year but I do get panicky when I<br/>\nthink about it. A friend suggested to me that I make a yearbook. She does<br/>\none and her kids love to read it from time to time to remember the year. She<br/>\nputs in favourite pictures, photos, writes about the places they&#39;ve been<br/>\netc. We began one this year and the kids love contributing to it. I&#39;m hoping<br/>\nit will count as record keeping!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!
