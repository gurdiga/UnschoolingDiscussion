To rest in Jesus instead of Sabath laws.  That all <br/>\ntheir works are like filthy rags, so just trust in Jesus&#39; blood to <br/>\ncover their sins instead of sacrificing animals.  And now not just <br/>\npeople who have born physically to Jewish parents can consider <br/>\nthemselves God&#39;s chosen people.
