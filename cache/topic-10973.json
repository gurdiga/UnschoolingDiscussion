My DH is a police<br/>\n&gt; officer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>\n&gt; does. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>\n&gt; hard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>\n&gt; his uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>\n&gt; work. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>\n&gt; bedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>\n&gt; daddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>\n&gt; prayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>\n&gt; difficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>\n&gt; that was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>\n&gt; bedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>\n&gt; get shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>\n&gt; thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>\n&gt; long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>\n&gt; the case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>\n&gt; night I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>\n&gt; because I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>\n&gt; possible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>\n&gt; Then DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>\n&gt; I asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>\n&gt; it and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>\n&gt; fine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; make an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>\n&gt; said anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>\n&gt; then it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>\n&gt; I feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>\n&gt; then give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>\n&gt; must do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>\n&gt; daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get Yahoo!

People worry about loved ones.  We were just discussing that earlier this week.   You should not try to stop your son&#39;s concerns, as they are normal.  But I do think that you should try to alleviate some of the unneccassary worry.  However, he is always going to be concerned about his fathr at work, as long as daddy has a dangerous job.  Let&#39;s face it, cops do get killed at work, and that is overdramatized in movies and tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it would be extremely beneficial if your hubby could arrange a special &quot;take my son to work&quot; day with his superiors.  Let your son ride in the car with dad, see dad talking to people, taking statements, doing what he does, as long as he is exempt from taking the more dangerous calls that day.  People learn from experience, and if your son has the wrong impression about what Daddy does during the day, than all the talking in the wold will probably not change his mind.  He needs to see for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf letting him ride along is not legally possible, perhaps he can at least take him down to the station, show him around, let him sit in the squad car, talk to other officers about what they do, and maybe walk a safe beat with dad for a little bit.

I have a 5 yo son, and a 3 yo <br/>\nson, and a 10 mo daughter.  For most of my children&#39;s lives, my dh has worked <br/>\nday shift.  Sounds like yours is working 3rd shift now.    Where do you live? <br/>\n We live in So. Indiana.  You have said that you are very open with him... <br/>\nhow much does he know about police work?  Our boys really have not asked much <br/>\nabout getting shot.  They have very limited knowledge about guns.  I think <br/>\nour oldest has asked if dh has ever shot anyone,  and dh told him that he had <br/>\nnot, and hoped that he never has to.  Dh explained that the gun was there to <br/>\nbe used only for protection when he was at work.  He keeps the explanations <br/>\n&quot;short and sweet&quot; at this time in their lives.  Then he makes sure that the <br/>\nkids get exposed to the many aspects of police work, such as helping people <br/>\nin different ways.  They enjoy hearing the sirens on the squad car, visiting <br/>\nthe station, and wearing old uniform shirts.  Has your son watched much tv <br/>\nwhere police dramas might be on?  Or does he have friends that have said <br/>\nsomething to scare him , maybe?  One thing you can do is let your son see the <br/>\nprotective vest and maybe even put it on, so he can see how heavy it is.  You <br/>\ncan help him see how it is there to protect his daddy , just in case there <br/>\nwould ever be a &quot;bad guy&quot; that had a gun.  And then express that most police <br/>\nofficers don&#39;t get shot and don&#39;t use their guns very often.  Hopefully he <br/>\nwill begin to feel re-assured.  Maybe some library books on police officers <br/>\ncould be helpful, as they are light-hearted in nature, and maybe will be <br/>\nhelpful in lessening his worries.  Most of all, stress that police officers <br/>\nare there to help people, and that is their main purpose.  Give examples such <br/>\nas helping people if their cars break down, helping people settle arguments, <br/>\nhelp to find someone who is lost, etc...  Just keep trying to reinforce the <br/>\nother aspects of this line  of work, and keep reassuring him that most <br/>\nofficers never have to shoot people, and that most officers never get shot.  <br/>\nI hope this helps a little!

I think it shows compassion for others as well as a developing <br/>\nunderstanding of how the world works.  Also, death and the possibility that <br/>\nparents will die is a very typical topic of concern for a 5 yr old (at least <br/>\nin my experience with children...my own and lots of other people&#39;s).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would emphasize the service that daddy is giving to the community.  That <br/>\ndaddy feels strongly enough about protecting other people that he is willing <br/>\nto take the risks that go with the job.  Even go so far, if you can, to <br/>\nexpress your personal appreciation that DH is willing to put his life on the <br/>\nline.  (in gentle terms, perhaps...?).  Encourage the idea that HIS daddy <br/>\nis/may be a hero every day he goes to work, by saving someone else&#39;s life or <br/>\nmaking the community safer for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe have Daddy show DS some of the protective equipment he wears.  Or tell <br/>\nabout he training he gets to keep him safe and help him make good decisions <br/>\non the job.  This could be as simple as stating that the police department <br/>\nhas a training program for Daddy to help him know how to stay safe.  Share <br/>\nappropriate stories of people he has helped.  If there have times of <br/>\nmiraculous events where daddy has been protected, maybe share those.  (I know <br/>\nthat idea could get touchy...but, as always, it&#39;s your call)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would NOT discourage ds from continuing to ask that daddy be safe and not <br/>\nshot.  But, you also may need to have some family discussion about some <br/>\nthings happening in spite of our prayers.  That doesn&#39;t mean that God doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlove ds or daddy, but that God has another plan or will provide another way <br/>\nor just that bad things sometimes happen to good people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not hurt to point out that not everyone that is shot dies.  Maybe <br/>\nthe police department has some reassuring statistics about this?  Let him <br/>\nknow that if something happens to daddy, his police buddies will get him to a <br/>\ndoctor ASAP and that they will also let your family know there is a problem.  <br/>\n(ie go to sleep, you&#39;ll get woke up with a huge commotion if something <br/>\nhappens, or something like that)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this paraphrased in ways that work best for your family, of course!  <br/>\nThere might be a psychologist at DH&#39;s work that would have some suggestions <br/>\nfor ways to deal with this fear.  It is a common one for spouses, parents and <br/>\nchildren.  (my SIL is a city cop here in Olympia, WA...we&#39;ve had to deal with <br/>\nthis fear on a personal basis)  <br/>\n<br/>\nEncourage ds and daddy to spend good time together.  Help father and son <br/>\nenjoy those times.  Not from a sense of &#39;it may be our last time together&#39; <br/>\nbut look how much we enjoy being together.  Let&#39;s cherish this time, right <br/>\nnow and make memories right now...when you are older we&#39;ll talk about these <br/>\nthings that are happening because they&#39;ll be memories.  (making any sense <br/>\nhere?)<br/>\n<br/>\n(starting to ramble...so delete if it&#39;s boring or inapplicable!)  When my DH <br/>\nwent to middle east (Qatar), DS overheard someone at church ask DH if he was <br/>\nconcerned about being so close to war torn countries and did he think he <br/>\nwould be in danger while he was there?  This scared DS quite a bit (gee <br/>\nthanks!).  We explained in simple and clear terms that we felt strongly that <br/>\ndaddy was needed in Qatar at this time (it was a civilian job, we could have <br/>\nturned it down, but we believe very much in personal revelation, given by God <br/>\nto the individual.  It is our belief that this particular job offer was an <br/>\nassignment with higher callings than mere employment.)  We explained that IF <br/>\nDaddy should die while he was overseas, we would have comfort that it <br/>\nhappened while he was serving God (insert a cause you believe in...).  We <br/>\nthen went on to explain that we really didn&#39;t believe there was personal <br/>\ndanger.  That daddy would take precautions such as staying in touch with the <br/>\nAmerican embassy, the company he worked for had emergency evacuation protocol <br/>\nin place, keep aware of the news, make friends with the locals, try to blend <br/>\nin the crowd rather than drawing attention to himself (we are lucky here in <br/>\nthat with proper clothing he is the spitting image of an Arabian...that <br/>\nAmerican Indian Ancestry came in handy!) and that daddy would be praying for <br/>\nhis own protection and personal direction, as would we.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there, we pointed out that you never know when you are going to die.  <br/>\nLots of people die in car crashes or crossing the street or of a stroke, <br/>\nheart attack or other unexpected health problems.  You have to live your life <br/>\nthe best you know how and try to let the rest of it (death, in this case) <br/>\nhappen when/how/where it happens.  DS was a bit clingy for a day or two and <br/>\nwe had some times of concern while DH was gone (Ben Lauden (sp) was very <br/>\nactive and had actually put out threats directed at the project DH was <br/>\nworking on, for instance).  But, overall, this approach worked well for our <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, DS and I were called upon to help his best friend and <br/>\nher mother when the mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer almost <br/>\nimmediatly after DH went overseas.  I think the conversation we had already <br/>\nhad about death and never knowing when it happens helped him deal with the <br/>\ndeath of his best friend&#39;s mother.  It was difficult, to be sure, but we did <br/>\na good job.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Sonia Ulan","from":"Sonia Ulan &lt;sulan@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"04Cz1NIRFkBF_LhnI8uG3S7-A8vkHcWOQpS9oOm3UObNVSnOiWA3G_RIckOWXgEEie218NIQeVnbXVkxFCS1yTdb","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Son&#39;s praying for daddy","postDate":"963205491","msgId":10973,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5Njk1OTczLkEzRkRCN0RGQGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwNzExMDU0MTU2LjIwODczLnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwNi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10974,"prevInTime":10972,"nextInTime":10974,"topicId":10973,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Corallyn; My heart goes out to you and your darling, sensitive son.  What a difficult situation! The world can be a very scary place and children need","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191137022\">Hi Corallyn;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart goes out to you and your darling, sensitive son.  What a<br/>\ndifficult situation!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe world can be a very scary place and children need constant<br/>\nreassurance that their parents will do their utmost to protect them. <br/>\nObviously your son is aware of the reality of Daddy&#39;s job and is<br/>\nfearful.  I&#39;m thinking your 5 year old is a bit young though to deal<br/>\nwith such a big burden on his own.  If you can lighten his load he could<br/>\nhave some peace of mind.  It would probably be helpful and help ease<br/>\nsome of his anxiety if he can talk this issue out with you on an<br/>\non-going basis.  For the time being, while he is immature and needing<br/>\nsecurity, you might encourage him that Daddy is safe and your son&#39;s<br/>\nprayers can help.  Even if the unthinkable ever happened he could<br/>\neventually understand your wish to protect him and give him the sense of<br/>\nsecurity he so badly needs right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a child I was tormented with images of war I saw on the<br/>\nnightly news.  I was desperate for my Mom to tell me I was safe and<br/>\nneedn&#39;t worry about such a reality...instead, she often took the<br/>\n&quot;intellectual&quot; approach of not shielding children from the real world. <br/>\nAs a result, I endured many nightmares!  I think the nurturing,<br/>\nprotective approach is what Mothering is.  Children need to feel safe,<br/>\nloved, protected and never abandoned.  That&#39;s what your son is looking<br/>\nfor now...when he&#39;s older, (maybe at 10 years of age???) you can provide<br/>\nhim with more information if it seems appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\nCorallyn Berger wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a situation in my home and I doubt any of you<br/>\n&gt; can relate to it but maybe someone has a suggestion as<br/>\n&gt; to how to handle this situation. My DH is a police<br/>\n&gt; officer. And my 5yo son is very aware of what daddy<br/>\n&gt; does. We have been very open with him about it. It is<br/>\n&gt; hard not to be when 5 days a week he sees daddy put on<br/>\n&gt; his uniform with full gear and head out the door for<br/>\n&gt; work. Well, the other night when DS was saying his<br/>\n&gt; bedtime prayers one of the things he said was to bless<br/>\n&gt; daddy not to get shot. He has never said this in his<br/>\n&gt; prayers before and it really took me by surprize. I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t know what to say to him. Bed time is often<br/>\n&gt; difficult because he misses daddy. So I asked him if<br/>\n&gt; that was the reason that he misses daddy so much at<br/>\n&gt; bedtime and he said it was. He&#39;s afraid that DH will<br/>\n&gt; get shot at work. DS has also said in the past that he<br/>\n&gt; thinks that DH sits and shoots bad people all night<br/>\n&gt; long. We have tried to explain to him that this is not<br/>\n&gt; the case. I don&#39;t think he gets  it though. The other<br/>\n&gt; night I didn&#39;t want to say that DH wouldn&#39;t get shot<br/>\n&gt; because I don&#39;t know that won&#39;t happen. That is<br/>\n&gt; possible however small that likelyhood is. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to say this will never happen and then it does.<br/>\n&gt; Then DS will think I lied to him and he will be right.<br/>\n&gt; I asked him if I could have some time to think about<br/>\n&gt; it and then give him and answer. He said that was<br/>\n&gt; fine. When I talked to DH about it he didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; make an issue of it with DS. He was afraid that if we<br/>\n&gt; said anything more to him or made a big deal about it<br/>\n&gt; then it would further dramatize the idea in DS&#39;s head.<br/>\n&gt; I feel differently. I told him I would think on it and<br/>\n&gt; then give him and answer and that is what I feel I<br/>\n&gt; must do. Any suggestions as to what to tell DS about<br/>\n&gt; daddy gettin shot at work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Get Yahoo!
