My husband Brad and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-680690869\">Melody here again, thought I should tell a bit more about myself and family, just wanted to get that &quot;warning&quot; out there!  <br/>\nMy husband Brad and I homeschool/unschool with our children, Joshua, almost 16, and Angelina, just turned 4.  We decided to homeschool because of our experiences in school, and wanted our children to have more freedom to decide for themselves what THEIR interests are, and what THEY&#39;D like to pursue in life, rather than being made to blindly follow someone elses plans for their lives!  We want them to be able to pursue what they love in life and take/have all the time they need to do it!  We&#39;ve realized that much of what we were forced to learn in school wasn&#39;t remembered because the interest wasn&#39;t there, and a good share of it isn&#39;t even needed in life!  The really important things in life, like how to communicate well with others, how to care for and raise children to become emotionally healthy adults, etc... were not even touched on in school when we went, not sure how it is now!  <br/>\nAnyway, we wanted to join the list to communicate with, support, and be part of a group of like-minded people.<br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Withers <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 18, 2002 12:45 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] email friend cannot be reached please help!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi, I&#39;m new to the list, my name is Melody, I noticed this email and just had to respond, this is real strange.
