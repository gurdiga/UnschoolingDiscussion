It may mean less gifts for everyone, but they don&#39;t know!  Christmas is too commercial anyway!  I try for the family traditions. Both old and new!  Like making a gingerbread house and making our own ornaments.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Kim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We go for the more homemade celebration as well.  I&#39;m pretty old fashioned.  This year the big gift for my boys is going to be a new, bigger dress up trunk and some new props and outfits for it.  Some of it we are buying, but other things we are making.  We have a couple of other things for each of them, stockings and Thomas&#39; birthday gifts, that&#39;s it.  I feel secure in the knowledge that the warm and intimate family celebration, full of love and tradition, will be far better a gift for them than a mountain of presents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI come from a dysfunctional family, and there are usually enough presents to dwarf the tree.  I am sick to death of mounds of useless and gimicky junk, with little or no thought put into their selection.
