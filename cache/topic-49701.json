I <br/>\nplay the melody line out of broadway musical books that my kids have left <br/>\naround, a lot &lt;G&gt;. I play from solo books. I do a lot of just improvising - <br/>\nthat&#39;s mostly what I do. It is just for me - I don&#39;t play with a group. I <br/>\ndid play with a homeschooled kids&#39; orchestra for a couple of years - just <br/>\nvery beginning stuff, that was fun. I played some lines, solo, for a <br/>\nShakespeare company a couple of summers ago - it was just simple simple stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a Native American flute - I just improvise on that, too. I do <br/>\nplay that for people sometimes, when we&#39;re camping -- sometimes after <br/>\neverybody goes off to their tents to go to sleep I sit out by the campfire <br/>\na bit longer and play while they fall asleep. Used to work WONDERS in <br/>\ngetting my girl scouts to fall asleep &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a piano, an electronic keyboard, a mandolin, a penny whistle, a <br/>\ncouple of recorders, an autoharp, my cello, a couple of violins, bongo <br/>\ndrums,  a guitar and probably other instruments. Most are old and crummy -- <br/>\nand none of us are accomplished. Roya plays basic piano and guitar chords - <br/>\nso do I. Roxana is learning to play piano - it has taken her a long time <br/>\nsince she never wanted lessons, but she&#39;s learning and now she&#39;s taking <br/>\npiano class at the community college. Rosie plays too - I&#39;d call her an <br/>\nadvanced beginner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey/we all sing - all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now - Roxana is off working - helping with wardrobe at a musical <br/>\nshow. Roya is singing something very loudly - she&#39;s in the bathroom &lt;G&gt;. <br/>\nRosie is watching the Jesus Christ Superstar movie - we went and saw the <br/>\nnew US Tour production last week - with the ORIGINAL Judas (Carl Anderson) <br/>\nwho was awesome! Rox and I went to the opera - saw a lovely production of <br/>\nLa Boheme last week too. On Sunday we&#39;re going to see RENT.  Rosie went <br/>\nlast night to see a local musical production of Pinocchio which one of her <br/>\nbest friends is in - we&#39;re all going to see it next week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;d be listening to music too, except I&#39;m listening to the Harry Potter <br/>\naudiotapes --- the British version read by Stephen Frye.

My 10yo unschooler has been bugging us for the past <br/>\nyear to give him viola lessons (he has a passion for classical <br/>\nmusic). Well, we finally found a program we could afford (group <br/>\nlessons through our local university) and he started about 6 weeks <br/>\nago. The first handful of lessons were easy for him and he picked <br/>\nthings up quickly. NOW, however, the stuff is getting a bit more <br/>\nchallenging and he&#39;s starting to gripe about practicing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m torn between not wanting to force him to do something he&#39;s not <br/>\nthoroughly enjoying and wishing he would actually stick with it long <br/>\nenough feel a sense of accomplishment.  He has two one-hour lessons a <br/>\nweek and is expected to practice at home at least 5 days/week. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t *make* him practice that often; I&#39;m satisfied (and so is he) if <br/>\nwe get in a couple good sessions a week. I&#39;ve told him that as long <br/>\nas he feels comfortable with his progress and doesn&#39;t get to his <br/>\nlessons and feel &quot;lost&quot; he can practice at his discretion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has not asked to quit (yet), but practice sessions are becoming a <br/>\nbit of a battlefield. Learning a new skill, however much it&#39;s <br/>\ndesired, can be frustrating and it&#39;s all too easy to just give up <br/>\nwhen things start getting tough. I know the challenges of learning to <br/>\nplay an instrument, but I also know the rewards of sticking with it. <br/>\nProblem is that I&#39;m having trouble convincing him that the rewards <br/>\nare worth the frustration!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions?
