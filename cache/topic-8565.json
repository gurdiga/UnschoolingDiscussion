They kept telling me that unless she <br/>\nwas failing there was nothing they could.  When the schools still allowed <br/>\nthis I sent her to summer school every summer even if the school did not <br/>\nrecommend it.  I finally had her tested at a private facility and took the <br/>\nresults to the school.  The results said that by the time my daughter got to <br/>\n7th grade she would no longer be able to cope in school.  Well, the school <br/>\nsaid they did not recognize out side testing.  They said they would give <br/>\ntheir own test but never did.  She is now in 11th grade and still reads and <br/>\nwrites on a 6/7th grade level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time I found out about homeschooling and persuaded my husband to let <br/>\nme do it, he was afraid to allow my daughter as she was so close to <br/>\ngraduating.  I try to work with her however, we fight a lot.  She thinks I&#39;m <br/>\npicking on her.  She has friends who she likes to get help from so I guess <br/>\nthat is better than nothing.  She has finally showed an interest in reading <br/>\nother than required reading so I guess that is good too.  My only fear is <br/>\nthat she thinks she is too stupid to go to college.  I just keep talking to <br/>\nher everyday to see how she is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLorrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"strandbe@aol.com","from":"strandbe@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"GmwwquYksapgPO2DNNXB2sGu9Ebk9mmNOcUda74AuPLMS3uugtqFZLxiu5lODbrP3ryaX8QY2g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 550","postDate":"958659508","msgId":8565,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwLjU4N2U5MWUuMjY1NTU1YjRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8579,"prevInTime":8564,"nextInTime":8566,"topicId":8565,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1130057321\">&lt;&lt;My name is Lorrie.
