The statement is also supported by the Missouri Central<br/>\n&gt;District School Nurse Association.}<br/>\n&gt;On behalf of the Missouri Central District School Nurse Association<br/>\n&gt;(CDSNA) I ask you to consider the following school nurse perspective<br/>\n&gt;regarding the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine that is being mandated<br/>\n&gt;for all newborns and school age children in America. We ask you to<br/>\n&gt;please consider the following information and submit it into the<br/>\n&gt;congressional testimony.<br/>\n&gt;As school nurses we are continually seeing more and more damaged<br/>\n&gt;children entering our schools and we are very concerned that a<br/>\n&gt;significant portion of that damage may be due to the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>\n&gt;assault on the newborn neurological and immune system.<br/>\n&gt;I am a registered professional nurse and the district health services<br/>\n&gt;coordinator for a multi-school district. I am writing on behalf of all<br/>\n&gt;the school nurses in our district. We have very grave concerns about the<br/>\n&gt;hepatitis B vaccine. For the past three or four years our school<br/>\n&gt;districts have noted a significant increase in the number of children<br/>\n&gt;entering school with developmental disorders, learning disabilities,<br/>\n&gt;attention deficit disorders and/or serious chronic illness such as<br/>\n&gt;diabetes, asthma and seizure disorders. Each of the past four years has<br/>\n&gt;been worse than the year before. There is only one common thread we can<br/>\n&gt;identify in these children: they are the children who received the first<br/>\n&gt;trial hepatitis B injections as newborns in the early 1990s. As the<br/>\n&gt;hepatitis B compliance rate in newborns has gone up in our community, so<br/>\n&gt;has the percentage of damaged children. This is very alarming.<br/>\n&gt;Because of having so many damaged children we have tried to find the<br/>\n&gt;long term clinical trials that ruled this vaccine &quot;safe and effective&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;We discovered through an exhaustive Medline search that the FDA based<br/>\n&gt;its decision to approve hepatitis B vaccine for administration in the<br/>\n&gt;first hours of a newborn baby&#39;s life upon clinical trials and upon<br/>\n&gt;post-marketing<br/>\n&gt;surveillance studies in which patients and their doctors were asked to<br/>\n&gt;report any adverse effects they noticed within 4-5 days after each<br/>\n&gt;injection [4 days for SmithKline and 5 days for Merck]. The problems<br/>\n&gt;being reported in increasing numbers as occurring after hepatitis B<br/>\n&gt;vaccination appear to be autoimmune and neurological in origin. Such<br/>\n&gt;problems take weeks to months to produce noticeable symptoms, and cannot<br/>\n&gt;be spotted in a 4-5 day observation period. These are the only clinical<br/>\n&gt;studies that have been done by Merck or SmithKline. There is not one<br/>\n&gt;long-term study that we could find. The CDC and FDA have only these 4<br/>\n&gt;and 5 day studies to base their statement of hepatitis B vaccine safety<br/>\n&gt;on. It is amazing to us that they would be willing to risk our<br/>\n&gt;children&#39;s future lives and health on these 4-5 day studies. It seems<br/>\n&gt;only prudent to do long term consequence studies on the developing<br/>\n&gt;neurological and immune systems of the newborns and infants injected<br/>\n&gt;with this vaccine. It appears the only concern is protecting the vaccine<br/>\n&gt;and denying the connection between these damaged children and the<br/>\n&gt;hepatitis B shot they received within a few hours of birth. The CDC even<br/>\n&gt;admits the lack of clinical study and states they do not even know how<br/>\n&gt;long the vaccine will be effective. We found this amazing since the<br/>\n&gt;vaccine was developed for a population at risk for hepatitis B: IV drug<br/>\n&gt;users, high risk medical professionals and those who are involved in<br/>\n&gt;high risk sexual practices.<br/>\n&gt;In 1950 (before mass immunizations began), the USA had the third lowest<br/>\n&gt;infant mortality rate in the world. By 1986, the USA dropped to 17th<br/>\n&gt;place. In 1995 the USA dropped to 23rd and now the USA has dropped to<br/>\n&gt;the appalling position of 24th in the health of its children (but the<br/>\n&gt;USA is now first in vaccine compliance through government mandates).<br/>\n&gt;Does this make you nervous too?<br/>\n&gt;The elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of<br/>\n&gt;neurological and/or immune system damage: epilepsy, seizure disorders,<br/>\n&gt;various kinds of palsies, autism, mental retardation, learning<br/>\n&gt;disabilities, juvenile-onset diabetes, asthma, vision / hearing loss,<br/>\n&gt;and a multitude of new conduct/behavior disorders. We have come to<br/>\n&gt;believe the hepatitis B vaccine is an assault on a newborns developing<br/>\n&gt;neurological and immune system. Vaccines are supposed to be making us<br/>\n&gt;healthier, however, in twenty five years of nursing I have never seen so<br/>\n&gt;many damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our<br/>\n&gt;children. The census of ill children seen in our health rooms each day<br/>\n&gt;has increased by 300% in only four years. It had remained relatively<br/>\n&gt;constant in all the years before.<br/>\n&gt;In our last regional school nurse meeting we discussed whether the<br/>\n&gt;combination of so many viruses at one time (hepatitis B vaccine at the<br/>\n&gt;same time of the DPT, OPV and MMR) is causing the infants immune system<br/>\n&gt;to be overwhelmed and unable to mount a sufficient defense response. We<br/>\n&gt;are advocating clinical studies to determine: Is the combination of all<br/>\n&gt;these viruses at one time an assault on an infant&#39;s immune and<br/>\n&gt;neurological system that increases the chances for adverse reaction AND<br/>\n&gt;what are the long-term neurological and immune system responses to these<br/>\n&gt;vaccines. We are all continuing to research this issue and will be happy<br/>\n&gt;to share the many resources we have found with you. I hope you will do<br/>\n&gt;the same as you open up this issue.<br/>\n&gt;We (nurses, principals and teachers) have talked many times about the<br/>\n&gt;possible cause(s) of the continuing increase in pervasive developmental<br/>\n&gt;disorders (PDD), such as autism. From the literature we have found, we<br/>\n&gt;should expect a rate for PDD of about 2-5 in 10,000. In our community<br/>\n&gt;the rate in Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade is more like 1 in 150. The<br/>\n&gt;teaching staff is overwhelmed.<br/>\n&gt;As school nurses, we have had many parents calling and asking how they<br/>\n&gt;can exempt their children from the hepatitis B vaccination (HPB). Many<br/>\n&gt;of them have spent long hours in study and research perplexed over this<br/>\n&gt;issue. For the past six months we have been studying documents, books<br/>\n&gt;and research articles published by internationally respected doctors and<br/>\n&gt;scientists that cause us grave concern. You must understand that we<br/>\n&gt;began this study to reassure our parents and show them the truth about<br/>\n&gt;how safe vaccines are. Unfortunately, our sincere, honest, dedicated<br/>\n&gt;study has caused a complete reversal of our once strongly held beliefs.<br/>\n&gt;Instead of being able to reassure the parents, we have found ourselves<br/>\n&gt;being drawn deeper and deeper into this unbelievable controversy over<br/>\n&gt;vaccines that is raging among physicians, scientists, researchers,<br/>\n&gt;parents, and the government. We pray you will have the courage to shine<br/>\n&gt;the light on this controversy through these hepatitis B hearings.<br/>\n&gt;My daughters own experience with the hepatitis B vaccine made me much<br/>\n&gt;more open-minded to the information we have been receiving from parents,<br/>\n&gt;teachers and other nurses in our community. I personally have had to<br/>\n&gt;research this on my own to determine if I have been enforcing a policy<br/>\n&gt;that is actually harming more children than it will ever help. I have<br/>\n&gt;spent countless hours reading books, vaccine-hearing testimony, research<br/>\n&gt;papers, medical journal articles and Internet web-sites from around the<br/>\n&gt;world. I did not come to my decision easily or lightly, I assure you.<br/>\n&gt;Twenty-five years of total belief in something does not shake that<br/>\n&gt;easily. I have repeated the well-rehearsed refrain &quot;Be Wise, Immunize&quot;<br/>\n&gt;thousands of times during those years and reassured countless parents<br/>\n&gt;that they were doing the right thing by vaccinating their precious<br/>\n&gt;children . . . even the ones who came to me with serious doubts and<br/>\n&gt;reservations. I will now have to live with that.<br/>\n&gt;We are all now faced with a moral dilemma: will we protect the &quot;sacred<br/>\n&gt;cow of conventional vaccine philosophy&quot; or will we stand up and speak<br/>\n&gt;out for the &quot;health and well being of innocent children&quot;? We choose<br/>\n&gt;children. We wonder, which will our government choose?<br/>\n&gt;Because the hepatitis B vaccine was developed for those at risk of<br/>\n&gt;disease, including IV drug users and sexually promiscuous individuals,<br/>\n&gt;efforts to require administration of the vaccine to most, if not all of<br/>\n&gt;the U.S. population is very controversial. The increasing number of<br/>\n&gt;adverse reaction reports connected with this vaccine exacerbates the<br/>\n&gt;controversy. The controversy stems to a great extent from our lack of<br/>\n&gt;understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to the hepatitis<br/>\n&gt;B surface antigen and lack of long term follow-up of individuals who<br/>\n&gt;have received the vaccine. In a January 27, 1999 press release, the<br/>\n&gt;National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) released figures which show<br/>\n&gt;that the number of hepatitis B vaccine-associated serious adverse event<br/>\n&gt;and death reports in American children under the age of 14 outnumber the<br/>\n&gt;reported cases of hepatitis B disease.<br/>\n&gt;During our research we discovered a copy of the grant proposal submitted<br/>\n&gt;recently to the National Institute of Health by Dr. B. S. Dunbar, who<br/>\n&gt;has worked in autoimmunity and vaccine development for over twenty years<br/>\n&gt;and was honored two years ago by the National Institute of Health. Dr.<br/>\n&gt;Dunbar is working with a team of veteran vaccine researchers from all<br/>\n&gt;over the world. Their grant is requested for the purpose of studying the<br/>\n&gt;hypothesis that: hepatitis B recombinant vaccine does cause adverse<br/>\n&gt;autoimmune reactions in genetically susceptible individuals. This study<br/>\n&gt;will also provide new insights into the predictability of determining<br/>\n&gt;adverse side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine in individuals at risk<br/>\n&gt;as related to their histocompatability subtypes. Their study of<br/>\n&gt;auto-immune diseases/symptoms caused by the hepatitis B vaccine include:<br/>\n&gt;lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disorders, Guillain<br/>\n&gt;Barre syndrome, demyelinating disorders such as optic neuritis<br/>\n&gt;(blindness), Bells palsy, demyelinating neuropathy (multiple<br/>\n&gt;developmental disorders), multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and<br/>\n&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome to mention the most common.<br/>\n&gt;This group of internationally respected vaccine researchers headed up by<br/>\n&gt;Dr. Dunbar also point out that, &quot;The studies (for the approval of HPB)<br/>\n&gt;were not designed to assess serious, rare adverse events; the total<br/>\n&gt;number of recipients were too small; and the follow-up was too short to<br/>\n&gt;detect rare or delayed, serious, adverse reactions.&quot; Finally they point<br/>\n&gt;out that &quot;overall the number of examples of adverse neurologic outcomes<br/>\n&gt;following receipt of hepatitis B vaccine are of concern, particularly<br/>\n&gt;those resulting in demyelinating neurologic disease.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;They continue, &quot;In view of these observations. . . it is medically<br/>\n&gt;crucial to evaluate the nature of the autoimmune reactions (i.e. risks)<br/>\n&gt;associated with the hepatitis B vaccine and to determine if individuals<br/>\n&gt;who will have these adverse reactions can be identified in advance of<br/>\n&gt;receiving the vaccine&quot;. There are critical questions that must be<br/>\n&gt;addressed to establish<br/>\n&gt;the risk/benefit of the current hepatitis B vaccines in the United<br/>\n&gt;States. These questions are particularly important in view of recent<br/>\n&gt;mandates to vaccinate all children including newborn infants.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;You may read this grant proposal at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm\">http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;Many groups have called for a moratorium on hepatitis B vaccination<br/>\n&gt;until some of these questions can be answered adequately. The NVIC<br/>\n&gt;reported &quot;Newborn babies are dying shortly after their shots and their<br/>\n&gt;deaths are being written off as sudden infant death syndrome. Parents<br/>\n&gt;should have the right to give their informed consent to vaccination and<br/>\n&gt;Congress should give emergency, priority funding to independent<br/>\n&gt;scientists, who can take an unbiased look at this vaccine, instead of<br/>\n&gt;leaving the search for truth in the hands of government officials who<br/>\n&gt;have already decided to force every child to get the vaccine&quot;. We agree<br/>\n&gt;completely. The NVIC can be contacted at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.909shot.com\">http://www.909shot.com</a> for<br/>\n&gt;further information.<br/>\n&gt;In Dr. Coulters book, &quot;Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality&quot;<br/>\n&gt;the thesis is developed that the &quot;sociopathic personality&quot; which has<br/>\n&gt;emerged on a mass scale in recent decades, and which is responsible for<br/>\n&gt;a disproportionate amount of crime and violence, is causally linked to<br/>\n&gt;the childhood vaccination program. Vaccination frequently causes<br/>\n&gt;encephalitis and neuropathy that in turn leads to these<br/>\n&gt;post-encephalitic states and conditions. In his book, Dr. Coulter<br/>\n&gt;presents a time line of increase in developmental disability related to<br/>\n&gt;vaccine introduction that is indeed frightening. Dr. Coulter believes<br/>\n&gt;about 20% of our children are suffering from this neurological vaccine<br/>\n&gt;damage. We believe some of these vaccine experts should be on the<br/>\n&gt;President&#39;s Youth Violence task force.<br/>\n&gt;Our own school district&#39;s confidential health statistics show at least<br/>\n&gt;20% of our children (K-3) have significant neurological damage and/or<br/>\n&gt;chronic illness. The last three years have shown an acceleration in the<br/>\n&gt;numbers of children who are entering our schools with these<br/>\n&gt;&quot;developmental disorders&quot;. (Could these be the same infants who received<br/>\n&gt;the first trial doses of hepatitis B as only a few hour-old newborns?)<br/>\n&gt;As school nurses, working with these damaged children on a daily basis,<br/>\n&gt;we pray this is not true. If it is, the ramification to this generation<br/>\n&gt;of children is unthinkable!<br/>\n&gt;Should we not pause, call for a moratorium on these poorly tested,<br/>\n&gt;rapidly approved vaccines, and allow independent American physicians and<br/>\n&gt;researchers to study them before blindly injecting an experimental<br/>\n&gt;vaccine into an entire generation? (We have found the only ones<br/>\n&gt;declaring the vaccines safety are the ones who are making millions of<br/>\n&gt;dollars from its sales, whose employment depends on it or the ones being<br/>\n&gt;funded by the drug companies vast number of grants and fundings. The<br/>\n&gt;independent researchers seem to be coming up with an entirely different<br/>\n&gt;report.) Vaccine producers have nothing to lose since our U.S. Congress<br/>\n&gt;has made them immune from responsibility or liability for injuries<br/>\n&gt;caused from their vaccines. The push is on for them to create more and<br/>\n&gt;more vaccines. There are huge amounts of money being made by these<br/>\n&gt;people who no longer worry about the consequences of their inadequate<br/>\n&gt;clinical trials. The United States government has had to pay out nearly<br/>\n&gt;a billion dollars in damages to families who can prove their children<br/>\n&gt;have been damaged or killed by vaccines, and there are thousands more<br/>\n&gt;cases pending.

The statement is also supported by the Missouri Central<br/>\nDistrict School Nurse Association.} <br/>\nOn behalf of the Missouri Central District School Nurse Association<br/>\n(CDSNA) I ask you to consider the following school nurse perspective<br/>\nregarding the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine that is being mandated<br/>\nfor all newborns and school age children in America. We ask you to<br/>\nplease consider the following information and submit it into the<br/>\ncongressional testimony. <br/>\nAs school nurses we are continually seeing more and more damaged<br/>\nchildren entering our schools and we are very concerned that a<br/>\nsignificant portion of that damage may be due to the hepatitis B vaccine<br/>\nassault on the newborn neurological and immune system. <br/>\nI am a registered professional nurse and the district health services<br/>\ncoordinator for a multi-school district. I am writing on behalf of all<br/>\nthe school nurses in our district. We have very grave concerns about the<br/>\nhepatitis B vaccine. For the past three or four years our school<br/>\ndistricts have noted a significant increase in the number of children<br/>\nentering school with developmental disorders, learning disabilities,<br/>\nattention deficit disorders and/or serious chronic illness such as<br/>\ndiabetes, asthma and seizure disorders. Each of the past four years has<br/>\nbeen worse than the year before. There is only one common thread we can<br/>\nidentify in these children: they are the children who received the first<br/>\ntrial hepatitis B injections as newborns in the early 1990s. As the<br/>\nhepatitis B compliance rate in newborns has gone up in our community, so<br/>\nhas the percentage of damaged children. This is very alarming. <br/>\nBecause of having so many damaged children we have tried to find the<br/>\nlong term clinical trials that ruled this vaccine &quot;safe and effective&quot;.<br/>\nWe discovered through an exhaustive Medline search that the FDA based<br/>\nits decision to approve hepatitis B vaccine for administration in the<br/>\nfirst hours of a newborn baby&#39;s life upon clinical trials and upon <br/>\npost-marketing <br/>\nsurveillance studies in which patients and their doctors were asked to<br/>\nreport any adverse effects they noticed within 4-5 days after each<br/>\ninjection [4 days for SmithKline and 5 days for Merck]. The problems<br/>\nbeing reported in increasing numbers as occurring after hepatitis B<br/>\nvaccination appear to be autoimmune and neurological in origin. Such<br/>\nproblems take weeks to months to produce noticeable symptoms, and cannot<br/>\nbe spotted in a 4-5 day observation period. These are the only clinical<br/>\nstudies that have been done by Merck or SmithKline. There is not one<br/>\nlong-term study that we could find. The CDC and FDA have only these 4<br/>\nand 5 day studies to base their statement of hepatitis B vaccine safety<br/>\non. It is amazing to us that they would be willing to risk our<br/>\nchildren&#39;s future lives and health on these 4-5 day studies. It seems<br/>\nonly prudent to do long term consequence studies on the developing<br/>\nneurological and immune systems of the newborns and infants injected<br/>\nwith this vaccine. It appears the only concern is protecting the vaccine<br/>\nand denying the connection between these damaged children and the<br/>\nhepatitis B shot they received within a few hours of birth. The CDC even<br/>\nadmits the lack of clinical study and states they do not even know how<br/>\nlong the vaccine will be effective. We found this amazing since the<br/>\nvaccine was developed for a population at risk for hepatitis B: IV drug<br/>\nusers, high risk medical professionals and those who are involved in<br/>\nhigh risk sexual practices. <br/>\nIn 1950 (before mass immunizations began), the USA had the third lowest<br/>\ninfant mortality rate in the world. By 1986, the USA dropped to 17th<br/>\nplace. In 1995 the USA dropped to 23rd and now the USA has dropped to<br/>\nthe appalling position of 24th in the health of its children (but the<br/>\nUSA is now first in vaccine compliance through government mandates).<br/>\nDoes this make you nervous too? <br/>\nThe elementary grades are overwhelmed with children who have symptoms of<br/>\nneurological and/or immune system damage: epilepsy, seizure disorders,<br/>\nvarious kinds of palsies, autism, mental retardation, learning<br/>\ndisabilities, juvenile-onset diabetes, asthma, vision / hearing loss,<br/>\nand a multitude of new conduct/behavior disorders. We have come to<br/>\nbelieve the hepatitis B vaccine is an assault on a newborns developing<br/>\nneurological and immune system. Vaccines are supposed to be making us<br/>\nhealthier, however, in twenty five years of nursing I have never seen so<br/>\nmany damaged, sick kids. Something very, very wrong is happening to our<br/>\nchildren. The census of ill children seen in our health rooms each day<br/>\nhas increased by 300% in only four years. It had remained relatively<br/>\nconstant in all the years before. <br/>\nIn our last regional school nurse meeting we discussed whether the<br/>\ncombination of so many viruses at one time (hepatitis B vaccine at the<br/>\nsame time of the DPT, OPV and MMR) is causing the infants immune system<br/>\nto be overwhelmed and unable to mount a sufficient defense response. We<br/>\nare advocating clinical studies to determine: Is the combination of all<br/>\nthese viruses at one time an assault on an infant&#39;s immune and<br/>\nneurological system that increases the chances for adverse reaction AND<br/>\nwhat are the long-term neurological and immune system responses to these<br/>\nvaccines. We are all continuing to research this issue and will be happy<br/>\nto share the many resources we have found with you. I hope you will do<br/>\nthe same as you open up this issue. <br/>\nWe (nurses, principals and teachers) have talked many times about the<br/>\npossible cause(s) of the continuing increase in pervasive developmental<br/>\ndisorders (PDD), such as autism. From the literature we have found, we<br/>\nshould expect a rate for PDD of about 2-5 in 10,000. In our community<br/>\nthe rate in Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade is more like 1 in 150. The<br/>\nteaching staff is overwhelmed. <br/>\nAs school nurses, we have had many parents calling and asking how they<br/>\ncan exempt their children from the hepatitis B vaccination (HPB). Many<br/>\nof them have spent long hours in study and research perplexed over this<br/>\nissue. For the past six months we have been studying documents, books<br/>\nand research articles published by internationally respected doctors and<br/>\nscientists that cause us grave concern. You must understand that we<br/>\nbegan this study to reassure our parents and show them the truth about<br/>\nhow safe vaccines are. Unfortunately, our sincere, honest, dedicated<br/>\nstudy has caused a complete reversal of our once strongly held beliefs.<br/>\nInstead of being able to reassure the parents, we have found ourselves<br/>\nbeing drawn deeper and deeper into this unbelievable controversy over<br/>\nvaccines that is raging among physicians, scientists, researchers,<br/>\nparents, and the government. We pray you will have the courage to shine<br/>\nthe light on this controversy through these hepatitis B hearings. <br/>\nMy daughters own experience with the hepatitis B vaccine made me much<br/>\nmore open-minded to the information we have been receiving from parents,<br/>\nteachers and other nurses in our community. I personally have had to<br/>\nresearch this on my own to determine if I have been enforcing a policy<br/>\nthat is actually harming more children than it will ever help. I have<br/>\nspent countless hours reading books, vaccine-hearing testimony, research<br/>\npapers, medical journal articles and Internet web-sites from around the<br/>\nworld. I did not come to my decision easily or lightly, I assure you.<br/>\nTwenty-five years of total belief in something does not shake that<br/>\neasily. I have repeated the well-rehearsed refrain &quot;Be Wise, Immunize&quot;<br/>\nthousands of times during those years and reassured countless parents<br/>\nthat they were doing the right thing by vaccinating their precious<br/>\nchildren . . . even the ones who came to me with serious doubts and<br/>\nreservations. I will now have to live with that. <br/>\nWe are all now faced with a moral dilemma: will we protect the &quot;sacred<br/>\ncow of conventional vaccine philosophy&quot; or will we stand up and speak<br/>\nout for the &quot;health and well being of innocent children&quot;? We choose<br/>\nchildren. We wonder, which will our government choose? <br/>\nBecause the hepatitis B vaccine was developed for those at risk of<br/>\ndisease, including IV drug users and sexually promiscuous individuals,<br/>\nefforts to require administration of the vaccine to most, if not all of<br/>\nthe U.S. population is very controversial. The increasing number of<br/>\nadverse reaction reports connected with this vaccine exacerbates the<br/>\ncontroversy. The controversy stems to a great extent from our lack of<br/>\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to the hepatitis<br/>\nB surface antigen and lack of long term follow-up of individuals who<br/>\nhave received the vaccine. In a January 27, 1999 press release, the<br/>\nNational Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) released figures which show<br/>\nthat the number of hepatitis B vaccine-associated serious adverse event<br/>\nand death reports in American children under the age of 14 outnumber the<br/>\nreported cases of hepatitis B disease. <br/>\nDuring our research we discovered a copy of the grant proposal submitted<br/>\nrecently to the National Institute of Health by Dr. B. S. Dunbar, who<br/>\nhas worked in autoimmunity and vaccine development for over twenty years<br/>\nand was honored two years ago by the National Institute of Health. Dr.<br/>\nDunbar is working with a team of veteran vaccine researchers from all<br/>\nover the world. Their grant is requested for the purpose of studying the<br/>\nhypothesis that: hepatitis B recombinant vaccine does cause adverse<br/>\nautoimmune reactions in genetically susceptible individuals. This study<br/>\nwill also provide new insights into the predictability of determining<br/>\nadverse side effects of the hepatitis B vaccine in individuals at risk<br/>\nas related to their histocompatability subtypes. Their study of<br/>\nauto-immune diseases/symptoms caused by the hepatitis B vaccine include:<br/>\nlupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disorders, Guillain<br/>\nBarre syndrome, demyelinating disorders such as optic neuritis<br/>\n(blindness), Bells palsy, demyelinating neuropathy (multiple<br/>\ndevelopmental disorders), multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus and<br/>\nchronic fatigue syndrome to mention the most common. <br/>\nThis group of internationally respected vaccine researchers headed up by<br/>\nDr. Dunbar also point out that, &quot;The studies (for the approval of HPB)<br/>\nwere not designed to assess serious, rare adverse events; the total<br/>\nnumber of recipients were too small; and the follow-up was too short to<br/>\ndetect rare or delayed, serious, adverse reactions.&quot; Finally they point<br/>\nout that &quot;overall the number of examples of adverse neurologic outcomes<br/>\nfollowing receipt of hepatitis B vaccine are of concern, particularly<br/>\nthose resulting in demyelinating neurologic disease.&quot; <br/>\nThey continue, &quot;In view of these observations. . . it is medically<br/>\ncrucial to evaluate the nature of the autoimmune reactions (i.e. risks)<br/>\nassociated with the hepatitis B vaccine and to determine if individuals<br/>\nwho will have these adverse reactions can be identified in advance of<br/>\nreceiving the vaccine&quot;. There are critical questions that must be<br/>\naddressed to establish <br/>\nthe risk/benefit of the current hepatitis B vaccines in the United<br/>\nStates. These questions are particularly important in view of recent<br/>\nmandates to vaccinate all children including newborn infants.&quot; <br/>\nYou may read this grant proposal at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm\">http://webpages.netlink.co.nz/~ias/dunbar.htm</a> <br/>\nMany groups have called for a moratorium on hepatitis B vaccination<br/>\nuntil some of these questions can be answered adequately. The NVIC<br/>\nreported &quot;Newborn babies are dying shortly after their shots and their<br/>\ndeaths are being written off as sudden infant death syndrome. Parents<br/>\nshould have the right to give their informed consent to vaccination and<br/>\nCongress should give emergency, priority funding to independent<br/>\nscientists, who can take an unbiased look at this vaccine, instead of<br/>\nleaving the search for truth in the hands of government officials who<br/>\nhave already decided to force every child to get the vaccine&quot;. We agree<br/>\ncompletely. The NVIC can be contacted at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.909shot.com\">http://www.909shot.com</a> for<br/>\nfurther information. <br/>\nIn Dr. Coulters book, &quot;Vaccination, Social Violence, and Criminality&quot;<br/>\nthe thesis is developed that the &quot;sociopathic personality&quot; which has<br/>\nemerged on a mass scale in recent decades, and which is responsible for<br/>\na disproportionate amount of crime and violence, is causally linked to<br/>\nthe childhood vaccination program. Vaccination frequently causes<br/>\nencephalitis and neuropathy that in turn leads to these<br/>\npost-encephalitic states and conditions. In his book, Dr. Coulter<br/>\npresents a time line of increase in developmental disability related to<br/>\nvaccine introduction that is indeed frightening. Dr. Coulter believes<br/>\nabout 20% of our children are suffering from this neurological vaccine<br/>\ndamage. We believe some of these vaccine experts should be on the<br/>\nPresident&#39;s Youth Violence task force. <br/>\nOur own school district&#39;s confidential health statistics show at least<br/>\n20% of our children (K-3) have significant neurological damage and/or<br/>\nchronic illness. The last three years have shown an acceleration in the<br/>\nnumbers of children who are entering our schools with these<br/>\n&quot;developmental disorders&quot;. (Could these be the same infants who received<br/>\nthe first trial doses of hepatitis B as only a few hour-old newborns?)<br/>\nAs school nurses, working with these damaged children on a daily basis,<br/>\nwe pray this is not true. If it is, the ramification to this generation<br/>\nof children is unthinkable! <br/>\nShould we not pause, call for a moratorium on these poorly tested,<br/>\nrapidly approved vaccines, and allow independent American physicians and<br/>\nresearchers to study them before blindly injecting an experimental<br/>\nvaccine into an entire generation? (We have found the only ones<br/>\ndeclaring the vaccines safety are the ones who are making millions of<br/>\ndollars from its sales, whose employment depends on it or the ones being<br/>\nfunded by the drug companies vast number of grants and fundings. The<br/>\nindependent researchers seem to be coming up with an entirely different<br/>\nreport.) Vaccine producers have nothing to lose since our U.S. Congress<br/>\nhas made them immune from responsibility or liability for injuries<br/>\ncaused from their vaccines. The push is on for them to create more and<br/>\nmore vaccines. There are huge amounts of money being made by these<br/>\npeople who no longer worry about the consequences of their inadequate<br/>\nclinical trials. The United States government has had to pay out nearly<br/>\na billion dollars in damages to families who can prove their children<br/>\nhave been damaged or killed by vaccines, and there are thousands more<br/>\ncases pending. I just read that there are so many vaccine damage claims<br/>\nthat Secretary Shalala changed the rules to try to limit adverse<br/>\nreaction claims. Could this be true? If so, shame on our government. <br/>\nWe believe, as medical professionals, that we are doing a great<br/>\ndisservice to our country by forcing government mandated vaccines on all<br/>\nchildren.

Vaccine-caused injuries have just forced the Clinton<br/>\n&gt; bureaucrats to make four sensational announcements that bugle<br/>\n&gt; temporary retreat from their plans to force all American children to<br/>\n&gt; submit to government-dictated medical treatment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On July 15, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the<br/>\n&gt; American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) halted the use of the oral<br/>\n&gt; rotavirus vaccine, which is given to infants to prevent one of the major<br/>\n&gt; causes of diarrhea, after reports that the vaccine caused a bowel<br/>\n&gt; obstruction in some infants that required surgery to repair. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bowel obstruction, called intussusception, results when one<br/>\n&gt; portion of the bowel slides inward, like a telescope, into another part<br/>\n&gt; of the bowel and causes blockage. A previously healthy infant<br/>\n&gt; suddenly screams in paroxysms of pain. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In its initial trial, the rotavirus vaccine appeared to cause<br/>\n&gt; intussusception at 30 times the average rate, but the government<br/>\n&gt; pretended that those injuries were insignificant. Instead of testing<br/>\n&gt; further, the CDC and the vaccine manufacturer subjected babies to<br/>\n&gt; more than a million doses of this unnecessary, expensive, and<br/>\n&gt; inadequately tested vaccine. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While the risk of intussusception may have been mentioned on the<br/>\n&gt; package insert, it was not on the vaccine information statement given<br/>\n&gt; to parents. The arbitrariness of government vaccine mandates is<br/>\n&gt; shown by the fact that, for the previous year, CDC was demanding<br/>\n&gt; that the vaccine be given to all infants, and now suddenly a CDC<br/>\n&gt; spokesman is saying, &quot;No one should now be giving rotavirus vaccine<br/>\n&gt; to anyone.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The second sensational vaccine announcement came on July 9,<br/>\n&gt; when the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and the AAP issued a<br/>\n&gt; joint statement cancelling their previous recommendation to inject all<br/>\n&gt; newborns while they are still in the hospital with the hepatitis B<br/>\n&gt; vaccine. PHS and AAP now recommend that vaccination of newborns<br/>\n&gt; be limited to those who are at risk of getting hepatitis B from their<br/>\n&gt; infected mothers. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Their remarkable backtracking from the universal mandate for<br/>\n&gt; newborns must have resulted from the widespread publicity given to<br/>\n&gt; the many cases of vaccine damage causing lifetime injury or death<br/>\n&gt; reported on ABC&#39;s 20/20 and at the May 18 hearing conducted by the<br/>\n&gt; U.S. House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and<br/>\n&gt; Human Resources. PHS and AAP continue to recommend the<br/>\n&gt; hepatitis B vaccine for infants at 2 to 6 months of age, even though<br/>\n&gt; few of them are at risk. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile, 42 states require the hepatitis B vaccine for<br/>\n&gt; schoolchildren, although teachers and health care workers are not<br/>\n&gt; required to receive it. The legislator who sponsored the hepatitis B<br/>\n&gt; mandate in Ohio admitted that he did so at the request of a vaccine<br/>\n&gt; manufacturer lobbyist, while Governor Christine Whitman is trying to<br/>\n&gt; impose a New Jersey requirement administratively without legislation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In another announcement the same day, PHS-AAP issued a joint<br/>\n&gt; statement that revealed the risk to children of vaccines containing<br/>\n&gt; mercury and called on the FDA to &quot;assess the risk of all<br/>\n&gt; mercury-containing food and drugs.&quot; A mercury product called<br/>\n&gt; thimerosal is used as a preservative in many vaccines, even though<br/>\n&gt; the FDA last year banned its use in over-the-counter products for<br/>\n&gt; safety reasons. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Under the current CDC schedule, most infants receive a total of 15<br/>\n&gt; doses of mercury-containing vaccines by the time they are six<br/>\n&gt; months old, many given simultaneously. The fact that the FDA has<br/>\n&gt; prohibited the use of thimerosal for most products, but continues to<br/>\n&gt; allow its use for vaccines, sounds like political corruption in the<br/>\n&gt; vaccine approval process. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The National Vaccine Information Center has been criticizing the use<br/>\n&gt; of mercury in vaccines for many years. Contact lens solution bottles<br/>\n&gt; routinely advertise that they contain &quot;no thimerosal,&quot; yet any damage<br/>\n&gt; to adults from contact lens solutions must be minuscule compared to<br/>\n&gt; the same product ingested or injected into infants. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The fourth announcement came on June 17, when government<br/>\n&gt; officials voted to withdraw their recommendation for the use of the live<br/>\n&gt; poliovirus vaccine, and to recommend the &quot;exclusive&quot; use of the<br/>\n&gt; inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Since 1979, the only polio cases in the<br/>\n&gt; United States have been caused by the live vaccine because, taken<br/>\n&gt; by mouth, it travels through the child&#39;s body and can cause polio in a<br/>\n&gt; parent changing the diaper. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The unjustified delay in converting to the safer polio vaccine is due to<br/>\n&gt; mandatory vaccination laws that require the public to use a certain<br/>\n&gt; product. The government still demands that babies be given four<br/>\n&gt; doses of polio vaccine, even though, according to Surgeon General<br/>\n&gt; David Satcher, M.D., &quot;The Western Hemisphere was certified by the<br/>\n&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) as polio free in 1994, and no case<br/>\n&gt; of polio has been reported in this region since 1991.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are long overdue for a Congressional investigation into the validity<br/>\n&gt; of research and licensing standards for vaccines, the results of<br/>\n&gt; clinical trials (if any), the motivations of the vaccine policymakers,<br/>\n&gt; and the lobbying activities of the cash-rich pharmaceutical<br/>\n&gt; corporations whose profits depend on universal mandates rather than<br/>\n&gt; on sales to those at risk for various diseases. <br/>\n&gt;                                                    <br/>\n&gt;                                   Phyllis Schlafly column 7-28-99 </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1966,"nextTopicId":1989}}
