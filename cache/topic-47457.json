Would you not try<br/>\nto help the woman?<br/>\nThere was a time when men had every legal right to make this choice.  It<br/>\nonly changed because moral people said, never mind legal, it&#39;s just<br/>\nWRONG.  And today women who are hit can enlist the help of  the law.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren who are hit have no such help.  I won&#39;t stand by comforting<br/>\nmyself with &quot;a parents right to choose&quot; while a child gets hit.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t protect someone&#39;s imaginary &quot;right&quot; to spank because I fear I may<br/>\nlose my homeschool freedom.<br/>\nI&#39;ll stand up for that right on it&#39;s own merits.  I won&#39;t hide under the<br/>\nblanket of &quot;parental rights&quot; at the expense of some innocent child.   And<br/>\nI&#39;d stop anyone from smacking your kid if I was available to do it.<br/>\nToo bad I couldn&#39;t count on you for the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10137,"nextTopicId":47461}}
