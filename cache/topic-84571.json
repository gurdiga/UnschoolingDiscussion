Rarely does it occur to him to just start cleaning. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if I ask him to do something, he is willing and happy to help out. <br/>\nHe often does most of the family laundry, he&#39;ll clean litter boxes, empty or <br/>\nfill the dishwasher, straighten up a room...whatever. When there&#39;s a big job <br/>\nthat we&#39;d gladly pay an outside party to do if we had someone available, we offer <br/>\nto pay Julian (Cleaning the garage gutters comes to mind). Sometimes he tells <br/>\nus not to bother; he&#39;s happy to do it for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m careful to respect his time when I ask. And I try not to ask him to do <br/>\nstuff I know he hates. (when I do, it&#39;s for an important reason, and he knows <br/>\nthat, and is happy to do it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s mutual. Julian knows he can ask us to do stuff too, and is <br/>\nrespectful of our time and activities and tries not to ask us to do stuff we hate. <br/>\nThat&#39;s the advantage of the one kid/three parent ratio...you can usually find a <br/>\nwilling adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":84559,"nextTopicId":84561}}
