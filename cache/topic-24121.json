And I was glad to see them discussed.  To me, and I think I&#39;ve heard <br/>\nit said before, unschooling encompasses just about everything.  There is a <br/>\ngeneral worldview that seems to be shared by many unschoolers that I love.  <br/>\nThat of questioning, allowing and not limiting.  There are varieties in <br/>\ndifferent areas, bit I don&#39;t want to feel like getting &#39;off topic&#39; is a bad <br/>\nthing.  Again, I&#39;m a competent adult, and if I see something I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nread, I delete it.  I just subscribed to another homeschooling list and it <br/>\nseems much more dogmatic and not what I&#39;m interested in, but I&#39;m giving it <br/>\nsome time....I might get something out of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if the heat is just really getting to everyone.  It was nice <br/>\nand fall like here for a week or so, then the humidity came back.
