Whether it is success or failure, or wavering in the middle of the road, we are where we are because of someone or some thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly every person can pinpoint the time in their life when there was a turning point, a change for worse or for the better. And usually there is someone to whom they give the credit for such a change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout our lives we contact many people and they each leave an impression. As living continues the combination of all those thoughts and feelings and actions forms our opinions, our likes and dislikes, our fears and our loves. But there is one basic factor in all of this that turns us one way or other - the individual, the personal self. It is how we take life, what we expect, how we do our daily tasks, where we place our values that make the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are born with the right to choose - and whatever we choose there will always be someone there to help us be good or bad. But first, we must give credit where credit is due.<br/>\n<br/>\n*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*<br/>\n<br/>\nMay 15 - Daily Feast<br/>\n<br/>\nOur willingness to work at whatever we can opens doors to new opportunities. Willingness breathes life into us and gives us vision. Hope is good but determination is even better. It sets the tone to move, to do the thing set out for us. And we can do anything when we do not stop to consider what if we were to fail, or what is we are not appreciated. Cherokee women were never considered inferior to the men. They were honored and respected and educated themselves so they could teach their children. It meant hard work and determination to perfect what they could so they could pass it on. Sometimes, the main objective of our work is not just to prosper us but to do a worthwhile thing well. We keep labor on a high level, never taking the easy way out. There is honor in work - even in the most menial job. Success is short-lived when the work is done for appearances.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ If our children should visit this place.....they may see and recognize with pleasure the deposits of their fathers. ~<br/>\n<br/>\nSHARITARISH<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;A Cherokee Feast of Days&#39;, by Joyce Sequichie Hifler<br/>\n<br/>\n*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*&lt;&lt;&lt;=-=&gt;&gt;&gt;*<br/>\n<br/>\nPermission to repost the daily messages was granted by White Bison, Inc., an American Indian-owned non-profit organization.

ONONDAGA<br/>\n<br/>\nAt a gathering of Native Elders we were told that many men of today had lost their ability to look at the Woman in a sacred way. They said we were only looking at Her in a physical sense and had lost the ability to look at Her sacredness. They said the Woman has a powerful position in the Unseen World. She has the special ability to bring forth life. They told us to start showing Her respect and to look upon her in a sacred manner.
