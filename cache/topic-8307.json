We practice at home about 4 times a week.  He<br/>\nwas making excellent progress unti we took a vacation and didn&#39;t practice<br/>\nfor several weeks.  He has lost some of the skills he had acquired and is<br/>\nnot making much progress.  His main problem is with  &quot;s.&quot;  He sticks his<br/>\ntongue out between his teeth when he says it.  He needs to practice not<br/>\ndoing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is that he&#39;s not trying.  He doesn&#39;t seem to perceive<br/>\nthere is a problem,though now that he&#39;s regressed adults have a hard time<br/>\nunderstanding him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is &quot;how can I help motivate him?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided I will no longer interpret what he says to adults.  My idea<br/>\nis for him to experience their not understanding him so he realizes he has<br/>\na problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAnita<br/>\nHomeschooling Mom<br/>\nNottingham, PA<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are many will claim to tell you what is due from you, but only one<br/>\nwho can shear through the many, and reach the truth.
