Words are important and on a list with a<br/>\nspecific purpose its good to be using the same definitions of a word.  I<br/>\ndidnt know that sandra &quot;invented&quot;  the use of the word, . It seems to me to<br/>\nbe a pretty straightforward word but your definition for its particular use<br/>\nin unschooling is pretty ...particular :).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Im not leaving stuff out like a trap...though of course Im<br/>\npleased if it catches anyones interest.  I wont call it strewing here, but I<br/>\nprobably will be still using the term in a more loose way in italian (my<br/>\nversion of it).  I like how I use it, its &quot;simple and plain &quot; to me with no<br/>\nworrying on it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tho if my children do learn what the school officials would like them to<br/>\nknow on their exams because Ive invented games or made something , Im not<br/>\ncomplaining!  and my husband is breaths more easily since I have been<br/>\nchoosing to do stuff like that.  So maybe it seems to be multileveled, but<br/>\nreally Im just taking care of a lot of flys with one slice of bread and jam!<br/>\nit will make any official visitors happy, it makes my husband happy, it<br/>\nmakes me happy, and my kids are just as free to take or leave it . no traps<br/>\nintended tho I can see where the worry can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n Joyce :<br/>\n&lt;&lt;They&#39;re two separate things, both part of living a learningful life.<br/>\nSandra came up with the word strewing to get across the idea of<br/>\nsprinkling the home with interesting things for kids to pick up if<br/>\nthey get intrigued. They&#39;re not planned. They&#39;re there in the<br/>\nenvironment.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, that sort of strewing seems to me to be pretty normal stuff!  we<br/>\nalready have that! what is missing, lol, is stuff that might be on the exam<br/>\n:/ which I have very little control over, tho Im working on figuring ways<br/>\naround that...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If you&#39;re &quot;strewing&quot; things that involve a lot of prep then it will be<br/>\nharder to treat them casually. Harder to not be disappointed if the<br/>\nkids ignore them. Strewing needs to be casual. It&#39;s a leaf. A book. A<br/>\ncomic. A thing to twiddle with. It&#39;s chum tossed into the home<br/>\nocean. ;-) If they bite, they bite. If they don&#39;t, it drops to the<br/>\nbottom and you can sweep it away for now to replace it with something<br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want something that&#39;s more involved, think of it as a gift that<br/>\nyou want in the home. It&#39;s not a &quot;strew&quot;.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. I get how you use  the word. Nice.

You studied that person, learned likes, dislikes, interests, etc.<br/>\nYou found out maybe that your beloved liked spicy foods (and you hit every<br/>\ntex-mex restaurant in town). So you saw a new Thai restaurant open up nearby<br/>\nand extended an invitation to try it out. Thai food can be quite spicy. Your<br/>\nbeloved might say No thanks. Or maybe I&#39;ll think about it. Or maybe okay<br/>\nlet&#39;s go. And then afterward decide not to touch Thai food again, the spices<br/>\nare too different. You found something that might be of interest. Brought it<br/>\ninto view. Your beloved could do with it whatever suited�no strings<br/>\nattached. That no strings is where it differs from &#39;setting up&#39; kids for<br/>\n&#39;educational experiences&#39;. You bring home a neat bird&#39;s nest you found BUT<br/>\nit has strings attached (and not the ones holding the nest together)� it<br/>\nusually comes with enforced study of birds, nests, habitats, etc. rather<br/>\nthan &quot;Hey this is really cool�anyone want to see it?&quot; and let it take on a<br/>\nlife of its own�one might glance up and go back to drawing manga, another<br/>\nmight be fascinated and try to figure out what kind of bird it belongs to, a<br/>\nthird might look at the nest and try to weave something him/her self and<br/>\nmaybe get interested in weaving, basketry, knitting, and who-knows-what.

Just something interesting that can be ignored or &quot;found.&quot;  Not something that took several steps to procure or create, and would take several steps to use.  Why not call that what it is?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this will seem picky and odd to some, and maybe irritating.  I&#39;m not trying to make rules about strewing.  I&#39;m hoping for simplicity and plain, clear thinking, rather than two, three, four-level pressured complicated worrying.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I enjoy making these things prettily--I cant<br/>\nafford to buy them--and everytime I do, they are used for a while, and then<br/>\nthey go on to play something else. Sometimes they dont use them. For me it<br/>\nis all the same...that seems to me to be strewing: Im seeing an interest,<br/>\nfinding stuff (materials) that seem fun (we all enjoy playing memory--I<br/>\nthink thats how its called in english) and preparing them (sometimes buying<br/>\nthem) and putting it out where they can be used. Sometimes I use them<br/>\nmyself (for the italian).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Last night I read a response you wrote on learning to read where you suggest<br/>\nto make some cards of things he is interested in, with the words written on<br/>\nthem...It seems to me to be the same thing...or no? if not, why?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying with words on cards is that.  Playing with words.  Some kids find it really fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a suggestion years ago by someone who&#39;s no longer in and around the unschooling discussions, but she had &quot;word jail&quot;--a box for words that don&#39;t follow the rules, that aren&#39;t obvious or easy to read.  So simple, plain, &quot;right&quot; words went in one box, and the other one was &quot;word jail,&quot; and they did it for fun and to be funny and to play with the differences in English words that make sense on sight, and those that don&#39;t.  Like  (looking at this paragraph) maybe &quot;sight&quot; and &quot;right.&quot;  Though once you see a set (light, fight) they can maybe get out of jail for making some kind of sense.   Seven or eight hundred years ago, they had a &quot;hoik&quot; in the middle like some German words do, but now it&#39;s been dropped.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do, do lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] needing some clarity","postDate":"1319540710","msgId":63584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyNTg2RUQ5LURFRTMtNDJCNy04QzY4LTlBMzk2REFEQzFBQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyRDFGQTJBLTdCNzktNDNGRC1CMkRGLTExNDkxMzc4MjM5RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PENBRUhuYmViSDdaRzctMU0yS0YrcDRHSz01PVI9WnBvQzJydy03a3Q5MkRHaVluekYrQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDc0Rjg0MTI0LTk1ODYtNDg4RC1BNTg4LURDMkE4RjdGRkJENUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBRUhuYmVZPWdtQnFCUUxSb1dIVHFEVzdxR0tWVHRrZ3JGcC11WWlhQzJxOWU5M1BPZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDQyRDFGQTJBLTdCNzktNDNGRC1CMkRGLTExNDkxMzc4MjM5RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":63583,"nextInTopic":63585,"prevInTime":63583,"nextInTime":63585,"topicId":63551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I could talk about the baseboards, or I could<br/>\n&gt; rise up, step back and see that my kids grew up happily in an imperfect<br/>\n&gt; house, they had places to poo, the boys grew up to shave, and the little<br/>\n&gt; details aren&#39;t the focus.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yes,  I appreciate you taking the time to tell this story: I resonate very<br/>\nmuch with this way of looking at things--Ive been stuck in what I havent<br/>\ngot, rather than seeing what I have got: A lot of day to day freedom, a<br/>\nfamily that even with the struggles of being a schooling/unschooling home<br/>\n has shifted gears enough in the last few years for my older dds to notice<br/>\nand appreciate....and point out to any in the family that might be<br/>\ncomplaining, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; -=- I dont publish much yet, tho I have alot of photos collected<br/>\n&gt; by theme on the pc waiting for me to get over my writers block.-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You could just put the photos in, and come back later and write captions if<br/>\n&gt; you want.

You can also backdate writing on a blog--write today, but put the<br/>\n&gt; date that you did the things, so they&#39;ll still be in chronological order for<br/>\n&gt; anyone who wants to read it.

It doesn&#39;t have to be the future. I use future dates and times for<br/>\n&gt; Just Add Light and Stir and The Lyrics Game (which I haven&#39;t been keeping up<br/>\n&gt; lately, because Just Add Light takes all my blogging energy).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So if loss of blogging opportunity is part of your stress, you can let that<br/>\n&gt; go! :-)<br/>\n&gt; I knew lots of teachers who wrote their lesson plans just before the review<br/>\n&gt; day when the principal was coming to see them work.

It will be $3000 and some for the whole job.  The ideal would be to have a bathroom remodel, where they take that tub out entirely, knock down all the ceramic tile, take the floor down to subflooring, tear out the counter and that old sink, maybe move the shelves over and get a whole new mirror and medicine cabinet with new lights and maybe a skylight and...     $12,000 or more, no doubt.

I asked her if she wanted<br/>\nto do it all by herself but she decided she preferred if we did a family<br/>\nprogect, so we could use also art from the older kids (we came across lots<br/>\nof collections stashed away as we made our new work-play-space) as well as<br/>\nanything the smaller children might do as well as my own work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my &quot;feeling off&quot; that  Im noticing now comes on when I am thinking about,<br/>\nwriting about our days (for the blog-journal)...NOT when we are living and<br/>\ndoing but when Im writing (to post) about our days.
