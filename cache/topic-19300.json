Kids of all ages have written their own Maths problems, for others to solve. Some are really creative! My youngest two sons like me to read a problem aloud and we try to solve it together.  Mostly orally. They also like writing their own Maths problems for dad to solve when he comes home from work...And I like that it is their choice - I bought the book, it sounded interesting, I  left it around and read out some problems and they have become keen! ..Leonie W. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] math games","postDate":"1037032987","msgId":49664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQ0ZERTFDLjI0MURERDAyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDE0MTk1MDJFLUY1OTEtMTFENi1BMUJDLTAwMzA2NUZCODJCOEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":49661,"nextInTopic":49678,"prevInTime":49663,"nextInTime":49665,"topicId":19300,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**Today we used it to compare Chinese numbers (Sagwa) to hindu-arabic).

She <br/>\nskipped on to an old 5th grade math book we had from &quot;the early days&quot;.  <br/>\nShe got about a third of the way through, stopped - too boring, too <br/>\neasy, waste of time. She asked for and put on her shelf another book - <br/>\none of those mega math books that covers everything from arithmetic and <br/>\nalgebra to geometry and statistics (I think she likes knowing it&#39;s there <br/>\nand she could do it if she wants - I don&#39;t know if it will ever actually <br/>\nget used as a text, but it makes a nice reference book. Today we used it <br/>\nto compare Chinese numbers (Sagwa) to hindu-arabic). But, she wants to <br/>\njust do fun math for a while, to which I said fine. She likes stuff she <br/>\ncan do with her hands - even with books, she uses all sorts of <br/>\nmanipulatives from around the house - she doesn&#39;t want books, and <br/>\ncomputer games are a second choice, but we&#39;d like  a couple of those <br/>\ntoo. So, any thoughts on games, puzzles, computer games, etc. for a kid <br/>\nwho loves math?  She understands fractions, decimals, money, the basics <br/>\nand likes any kind of puzzle. We&#39;re going puzzle shopping tomorrow. She <br/>\nlikes to cook, so she gets plenty there, and she loves anything with <br/>\npatterns, and she likes music, so she gets that (quarter notes, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are some of the favorites out there?
