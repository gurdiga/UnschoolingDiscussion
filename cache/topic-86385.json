My first thought is that you need a different friend,<br/>\nrather than a different educational approach! <br/>\n<br/>\nI started thinking about what you wrote in a different post about the<br/>\nquantity of other kids in your home. Since it seems that Sarah does have<br/>\nlots of opportunities to interact with other kids, it seems unlikely that<br/>\nshe is socially deprived. However, speaking from my own meager experience<br/>\nwith Jayn (4), I had to limit the time that she was spending with a neighbor<br/>\ngirl (6) who is schooled and also parented &quot;traditionally&quot; with punishments,<br/>\ntime-outs, food etc limitations - all the usual stuff. Even a small amount<br/>\nof time with this kid seemed to have a bad effect on Jayn&#39;s personality, and<br/>\nstress level. I try to find kids for Jayn to play with from our local<br/>\nhomeschooling support group, with the parents who are gentle, attachment<br/>\noriented etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese (mostly) women are also where I find most of my friends now - none of<br/>\nwhom are going to react to any problem I share, with &quot;send them to school&quot;.<br/>\nMy group is not particularly unschooling friendly - made up of mostly<br/>\neclectic and unit study oriented families - a few school at homers, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get into those curriculum conversations. But they are universally more<br/>\nsimpatico in almost every area, than the schooling parents who make up the<br/>\nrest of my acquaintance. Jayn mostly wants me to play with her, her daddy to<br/>\nplay with her, or one other kid to play with her, rather than a group. I<br/>\nwould say find a local park day with hs&#39;ers, or start one. Your older kids<br/>\nmay find friends with parents whose style you would trust to be around them,<br/>\nfor playdates, so you can concentrate some extra time on your 2yo, playing<br/>\nsome of the fine motor skills support games that others have mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a thread here recently about someone who was feeling sad because<br/>\nshe was growing apart from some old friends who were not homeschool<br/>\nsupportive (let alone unschooling supportive). I have had the same feeling<br/>\nrecently from someone I have known a while - a single mom who has her 2yo in<br/>\nfull time daycare in order to work. She started going on about the<br/>\nhomeschooled children she has known who have &quot;social problems&quot; in an &quot;I know<br/>\nbetter than you&quot; tone of voice. The conversation was initiated because she<br/>\nwas concerned about the policy of her daycare place to initiate/push early<br/>\nacademics on her son. (He&#39;s 2!!!!) I was responding that she should follow<br/>\nher heart and gut about not allowing them to be the &quot;experts&quot; about her<br/>\nlittle boy.

I thought it was a cute take on the &quot;Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten&quot; essay that was popularly known..let&#39;s see...was it the late 80s or early 90s? ...And I consider it pretty accurate. What I truly needed to know in my life are things I taught myself. I&#39;d rather not debate the semantics behind &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; right now though if you don&#39;t mind..I have other more important things on my mind. <br/>\n <br/>\nNo, I&#39;m not leaving my children alone all day to learn things on their own. If I was going to do that, then yes, my children would be better off at school. We talk often, I involve them in housework and cooking and I spend time playing with them on their levels. I read to them on a daily basis. My house is always full of children from my neighborhood coming over to play with my children, and one child in particular prefers to be with me and says it&#39;s because I give her attention that she doesn&#39;t get from her mother. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is very rare for me to go anywhere without at least one of the children with me. This past summer, I babysat my friend&#39;s four children until the end of July when we were expecting Gracie&#39;s arrival. I spent the month of August in the hospital because I nearly died from complications. <br/>\n <br/>\nI can see where, to a degree, Megan&#39;s delays are our fault. In some ways she has not had as much direct attention as I would normally give since about last March until late July, because of various things; and when I came home from the hospital, I made a special effort to be sure to give her more attention from me instead of thinking that she was doing just fine chasing after her siblings and playing with them. That&#39;s when her speech began to improve...I just hadn&#39;t picked up on the other areas. I wasn&#39;t looking for them. There is a speech and hearing problem that runs in our family, so I picked up on that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not perfect, far from it, but I&#39;m not unwilling to admit when things haven&#39;t been going as they could be. Could I be doing more with them and less other things? Yes, and I will be. Have been in some ways for the past few months but I can see that I haven&#39;t quite &#39;slowed down&#39; as much as we may really need. And that&#39;s probably some of Paul&#39;s pushing lately to return to &quot;school&quot; work with Sarah is that he knows that if I was doing that, I&#39;d have to stay home to do it! <br/>\n <br/>\nYes, I do worry about the housework alot. We have a very small house, and with three active children it becomes a safety hazard to have things out of place, and it can be difficult to do much of anything if the house isn&#39;t clean. Personally, I could do with a little less of the constant cleaning, and I tend to let the children&#39;s rooms go..but my husband can&#39;t. <br/>\n <br/>\nI appreciate your suggestions of the pages to read. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 12/18/03 10:12:47 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamabethuscg@...\">mamabethuscg@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Everything I need to know, I learned on my own! &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really like that sigline?<br/>\nBecause several times you&#39;ve told us you were really glad to know things <br/>\npeople here have helped you with.

But ALL you have to do to make unschooling work well is <br/>\nto make the children your priority in every decision.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something that might help you.  It&#39;s &quot;Disposable Checklists for <br/>\nUnschoolers.&quot;  It&#39;s a way to enrich your life without turning to someone&#39;s pre-made <br/>\ncurriculum.  I don&#39;t think &quot;going back to more academic work more often&quot; is <br/>\nnecessarily the answer, but if you&#39;re doing nothing  particular at all with or <br/>\nfor your kids, you might be doing too little with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/194/jaunschooling.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/194/jaunschooling.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one on balance, which also involves deciding if you&#39;re doing too <br/>\nlittle:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/206/ndunschool.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/206/ndunschool.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHow would a child who is developmentally delayed benefit from being in <br/>\nschool?  Honestly, school chews those kids up and spits them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say examine where you can do more with them, but keep them home.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay more games with physical items, maybe.  One game we used to play was <br/>\nwith some solid-colored, various-shaped blocks we have.

Me.  Me.&quot;  So I gave him a <br/>\nset and figured he would play with them separate from us.  He was as good at <br/>\nit as Kirby was.  So we started going around each of the three of us making <br/>\nsomething and the others copying it.  And Marty was making more creative things, <br/>\ntoo, with blocks leaning, or one just set off from the rest, at an <br/>\ninteresting angle, or touching a little, but flat on the table.   The whole game was <br/>\ndifferent and better with Marty playing too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

The age where half of the<br/>\nkids could perform the skill gets translated in the testing into the age<br/>\nwhen a child &quot;should&quot; be able to do it.  Remember, for each skill that your<br/>\ndaughter &quot;should&quot; be doing that she isn&#39;t, half of all American kids her age<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do it either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack when my daughter was my foster daughter, still an infant, she was<br/>\ninvolved in Early Childhood Intervention.  My daughter&#39;s family background<br/>\nand siblings indicated that she would likely have trouble learning, have<br/>\nserious mental disorders, etc..  She was 5 months old and not even trying to<br/>\nroll over yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe therapist gave me some ideas to try to encourage Marsie to try to roll<br/>\nover but then she gave me the most wonderful, extraordinary advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;With this one, don&#39;t worry about germs or dirt or clutter or<br/>\nwhatever.  Just let her explore the world on her terms, as she needs to.&quot;<br/>\nIn other words, unschool her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Marsie spent lots of time in mud puddles, feeling her food with her<br/>\nentire body, being allowed to mouth anything that wasn&#39;t poisonous or a<br/>\ndanger of being swallowed.  We drove most people around us nuts.  No<br/>\npre-school would have allowed what Marsie was into.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 7, she has just been invited to join the competitive gymnastics team<br/>\nat her gym.  She is extremely verbal and precocious, well above average in<br/>\nintelligence.  Speaking as a mom and as a therapist, as long as your child<br/>\nhas kids and adults who interact with her in a fun and supportive manner,<br/>\nhas an environment where she is free to explore different and interesting<br/>\nthings, being home with family is the best thing going for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Elizabeth Roberts&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamabethuscg@...\">mamabethuscg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, December 18, 2003 11:05 AM<br/>\nSubject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Megan&#39;s Early Intervention Eval.
