Stop reading this list. Honestly, I think it is making you crazy right<br/>\nnow. I can sympathize, there are times in my life that I&#39;ve worked myself<br/>\ninto a lather about what random other people in cyberspace have to say. It&#39;s<br/>\nnever healthy. Just do it. Unsubscribe! At least for a few days. Just be<br/>\nwith yourself and with your family. Stop worrying about what anyone on the<br/>\nUnschooling list here thinks. Really! Do it now!<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Remove every single worry or doubt about how your children&#39;s lives will<br/>\nturn out without you helping them make it so. Release them all. If it helps,<br/>\nsit down and have a long meditation session and picture yourself dropping<br/>\nthem into a well, or a river, or a garbage dump and running them over with a<br/>\nbulldozer. Or write them all on paper and crumple each one and burn it, or<br/>\nthrow it into the trash. Examine every single one and drop it. Do so<br/>\nconsciously. Now go out and make it so. You are hereby released from taking<br/>\nthe responsibility for your children&#39;s future happiness. Live right here,<br/>\nright now, in today. Help them accomplish whatever makes them happy today,<br/>\nwhether that does or does not add up to some future goal or plan. Go to a<br/>\npark, have a picnic, sit and snuggle and watch a movie, or let them do<br/>\nwhatever it is they want to do. Just release them from the pressure of your<br/>\nwants, wishes, desires, and goals. Let them build their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Sit down and make a goal of your own desires, wishes, goals FOR YOURSELF.<br/>\nFind one of them and start working towards it, today! Want to learn to knit<br/>\nan afgan? TODAY, go out and find a beginning knitting class, or just buy a<br/>\nknitting book or just some needles and yarn. Want to run a marathon? TODAY,<br/>\ngo out and get some running shoes. Want to read all the classics? Go check<br/>\nJane Eyre out of the library TODAY. Just do it. Start building your own<br/>\nlife. Not your world that has been about your children for twenty-three<br/>\nyears. Your OWN wants, needs, desires. Just do it. Now. The only way to stop<br/>\nmeddling in your children&#39;s futures is to build your own. Start today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s it. Really, that&#39;s all there is to it. Come back to this list when<br/>\nyou truly feel it will not unbalance your life. I&#39;m not saying this to be<br/>\ncruel. This is a high-volume, high-intensity list. I&#39;ve been subscribed to<br/>\nit on and off for years. There have been times I&#39;ve taken a break of a week,<br/>\na month, or a year when it has been necessary for the balance in my life.<br/>\nThe trick is to know when the list is helping you and when it is consuming<br/>\nyou. I suspect deeply that right now this list is not helping you. So ditch<br/>\nit. Follow the three steps above, and you&#39;ll begin to see the paradigm shift<br/>\nthat is necessary to unschool. You really have to release all of that and<br/>\nbuild your own life to see it. You cannot see it when you are trapped in an<br/>\nexistence of trying to control your kid&#39;s lives and futures.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you, really. It can be a beautiful and joyous journey for<br/>\nyou. Let it be so!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139187074,"authorName":"MARK and JULIE SOLICH","from":"&quot;MARK and JULIE SOLICH&quot; &lt;mjsolich@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: three steps / others in the neighborhood","postDate":"1052012328","msgId":67618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2IwMWMzMTFkZCRlOWYzODBjMCQ5NjE5MzJkMkBtYXJrPg==","referencesHeader":"PGI5MGgzNitnamc1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67576,"nextInTopic":67784,"prevInTime":67617,"nextInTime":67619,"topicId":67464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not your world that has been about your children for twenty-three<br/>\n&gt; years. Your OWN wants, needs, desires. Just do it. Now. The only way to stop<br/>\n&gt; meddling in your children&#39;s futures is to build your own. Start today.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s it. Really, that&#39;s all there is to it. Come back to this list when<br/>\n&gt; you truly feel it will not unbalance your life. I&#39;m not saying this to be<br/>\n&gt; cruel. This is a high-volume, high-intensity list. I&#39;ve been subscribed to<br/>\n&gt; it on and off for years. There have been times I&#39;ve taken a break of a week,<br/>\n&gt; a month, or a year when it has been necessary for the balance in my life.<br/>\n&gt; The trick is to know when the list is helping you and when it is consuming<br/>\n&gt; you. I suspect deeply that right now this list is not helping you. So ditch<br/>\n&gt; it. Follow the three steps above, and you&#39;ll begin to see the paradigm shift<br/>\n&gt; that is necessary to unschool. You really have to release all of that and<br/>\n&gt; build your own life to see it. You cannot see it when you are trapped in an<br/>\n&gt; existence of trying to control your kid&#39;s lives and futures.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best of luck to you, really. It can be a beautiful and joyous journey for<br/>\n&gt; you. Let it be so!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Blue Skies,<br/>\n&gt; -Robin- </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] three steps / others in the neighborhood","postDate":"1051966354","msgId":67491,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4LjMwMTcyYzZiLjJiZTUxNTkyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":67474,"nextInTopic":67498,"prevInTime":67490,"nextInTime":67492,"topicId":67464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/2/2003 10:11:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time, kdl45@aol.com ...
