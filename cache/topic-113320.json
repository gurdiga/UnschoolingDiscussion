For living I do websites for local people but my passion is learning and I believe it&#39;ll stay like that for my entire life. At the moment i live with my girlfriend in Grosseto [Toscana] - a place with one of most clean shore in Italy! Previously i&#39;ve spend some time in Netherlands and Uk, but i was born in Poland. I&#39;m happy to discover this group and hope to find some useful information around.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy interests: accelerated learning techniques, improving my mind, checking out the effects of hypnosis and how it affects my personal life :) I believe that learning is an art and it&#39;s my deep interest since around 8 years! I&#39;ll be honest - i&#39;ve found this group after opening my blog about fast learning. Had some time to make this finally happen as i was thinking about it since more than year. I&#39;ve registered domain [fastlearningbrain.com] six months ago and finally had some more time in Christma&#39;s time to write few articles and put it on the net. I&#39;d highly appreciate if you&#39;de spend a minute or five of your time to take a look at it and give me any tips to improve! I also believe that you may find few interesting things, facts and techniques that you can use for your benefit - i do my best and post 2 messages a day. Well let&#39;s finish with that - hope to find a great community in here and people with interests similar to mine!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and have a great day!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113247,"nextTopicId":113314}}
