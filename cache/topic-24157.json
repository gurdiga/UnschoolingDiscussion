On <br/>\nthe flip side my cousins father left her mother when she was pregnant. he was <br/>\nan alcoholic and flaky. Later they found eachother and it was disappointing. <br/>\nAll her life she wanted to know her father. I think it would have been better <br/>\nto know him as a child instead of forming an image then having it blown.<br/>\n<br/>\n   As a parent it is a really tough call. I am sure there were times my <br/>\nmother didn&#39;t want to send me on that plane. She did and I am glad b/c I know <br/>\nmy father.

I am from an Irish Catholic <br/>\nyelling,screaming,stomping,cursing,family and it works. Usually. There are a <br/>\nfew in our family who shame and blame, verbal abuse. That is not right in my <br/>\nopinion. Much more harmful than yelling.I never have or will verbally abuse <br/>\nmy child but I will yell. Because it is in me and it happens. She is also a <br/>\nyeller and has been a very loud child since the day she was born. I remember <br/>\ntrying so hard to keep her a tad quieter in the hospital. No maternity ward <br/>\nhere,everyone else was in for knee surgery it seemed.One hall of patients. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Dh is also from a family of yellers Italian this time. Now he went the <br/>\nother way and rarely yells. But when he does watch out. So I think I&#39;d rather <br/>\nlet it out in its initial   stages. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It comes down to what you are saying,words hurt worse than tone.<br/>\n<br/>\n    NICKI~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23959,"nextTopicId":23956}}
