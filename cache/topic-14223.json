It was very hard for us to wait and it appears there will be no more <br/>\nchildren.  We are at the other end of the spectrum, so maybe my thoughts <br/>\nmight be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest is now married and has a 2 yr old daughter.  We began <br/>\nhomeschooling when the oldest was in the middle of his 8th grade year, the <br/>\nyoungest (now 12) has never been to public school (except to visit his <br/>\ncousins for lunch &lt;G&gt;).  With a 10 year age gap and so much of our lives <br/>\nfocused on getting the second child here for so long, there have been a lot <br/>\nof disappointments, challenges and joys.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, it was wonderful to have such an age gap once we got our prayers <br/>\nanswered and had the youngest boy in our family...for one thing we had a <br/>\nbuilt in babysitter (not that we left our darlings home much, mind you!  I&#39;m <br/>\nafraid we are definitely doting parents toward both our boys).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe found that the older boy was generally willing to include the younger in <br/>\nmost of his projects.  In fact, the older son often taught the younger <br/>\nsomething about what he was doing.  I&#39;m convinced it helped the older boy <br/>\nlearn even more because he was having to explain what he was doing, either to <br/>\nconvince little brother to leave him alone or to include him in the <br/>\nactivities.  Either way it became teaching opportunities.  It didn&#39;t take us <br/>\nlong to figure out it was much easier to simply include all family members <br/>\nthan to separate ourselves to different activities.  Since sharing time <br/>\ntogether is a very strong priority for our family, that has worked out quite <br/>\nnicely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think either boy is harmed in any way with the age gap.  There have <br/>\nbeen a lot of changes over the last few years with the oldest child striking <br/>\nout on his own.  The boys have a close relationship and we have no regrets <br/>\nabout the difference in their ages.  It&#39;s just part of their (and our) life <br/>\nexperiences.  Different from the experiences they&#39;d have had if there were <br/>\nlots of siblings, but no less significant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, <br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"benliam@aol.com","from":"benliam@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fi2zkP2h1nyVf7HtkNa_p7qDuwHy8U9GPgBH9iTDOetNkWKLdgaAzlbXV7pibx1mOkfOPVkd","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] julie","postDate":"975096397","msgId":14223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEyLmM4MWFkZWUuMjc1MDI0NGRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14224,"prevInTime":14222,"nextInTime":14224,"topicId":14223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/24/00 8:20:01 AM Eastern Standard Time, Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-176263152\">In a message dated 11/24/00 8:20:01 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  It seems the oldest one usually starts a project and<br/>\n then the younger joins in to the best of her ability.
