Thanks for sharing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody can make a judgment call without the opportunity to do so, and too <br/>\nmany families wait until puberty to let them even try.   After years of too much <br/>\ncontrol, it&#39;s like a wound up rubber band, tighter and tighter, and when they <br/>\ndo launch they go too far too fast and they&#39;re in territory they haven&#39;t <br/>\ncontemplated, and they don&#39;t trust their parents to help, only to exert more <br/>\ncontrol.    So it&#39;s VERY cool that while kids are still young some parents can see <br/>\nthat and undo it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause my kids have had lots of freedom and a safe place to come back to, <br/>\nthey&#39;ve shown since they were five and six that if a situation is uncomfortable <br/>\nfor them, they&#39;ll call for a ride home, or they&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot;  <br/>\nIt took some coaching and it took their full awareness that just because one <br/>\nsituation didn&#39;t work out, they would still have opportunities to try others.  <br/>\nIn other words, if they came back from a sleepover that wasn&#39;t going to turn <br/>\ninto, &quot;No, obviously you&#39;re too young for sleepovers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend there was a time when I had the house alone again for a few <br/>\nhours.  Keith the dad was at a friend&#39;s swimming, Kirby and Marty (17/15) were on <br/>\nDay 3 of a trip to Texas (they&#39;re asleep in their beds at the moment, which is <br/>\ncool), and Holly (12) had gone to a friend&#39;s, a few blocks away.  Keith had <br/>\ncome home and wanted to invite her swimming.  I called over there to talk to <br/>\nher.  The girl she was  visiting answered and said Holly was at the park <br/>\n(between our houses, closer to theirs).   <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;By herself?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With my dad.  They took some stuff over there for the barbecue we&#39;re going <br/>\nto have.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her to have Holly call me soon, and she did, and she wanted to stay <br/>\nthere instead, even though the friend was invited too.   She would have had fun <br/>\neither way, and so she stayed where she was.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she had gone I had watched Mystic River for the first time.  I would <br/>\npause it when she came in, and I told her I didn&#39;t think she would like it.  <br/>\nBut when she was going to walk to her friend&#39;s house (on Holly&#39;s own whim, not <br/>\nknowing they were going to do a barbecue in the park), I jokingly said since <br/>\nI&#39;d just watched a scary movie for moms, I wanted to remind her not to get into <br/>\na car with men even f they say they&#39;re policemen.  She laughed and said okay.  <br/>\nAnd I said, &quot;And you&#39;re not planning to run away to Las Vegas, are you?&quot;  And <br/>\nshe said, &quot;Well yeah, on Thursday.  I&#39;m going with you.&quot;  [Darn.  I had <br/>\nforgotten that part. &lt;g&gt;]     &quot;And you&#39;re not planning to go to a bar with [the <br/>\nother girl] and jump up on the bar and dance?&quot;    She shook her head slowly and <br/>\nlaughed and said &quot;Not that I know of.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Okay, go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s creepy about it is that the second that the girl said Holly was with <br/>\nher dad, I had a sub-dermal bristle.   It was interesting.  My body went &quot;oh <br/>\nno&quot; but my mind was fine.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Holly was little, she didn&#39;t like to be there even if everyone else was <br/>\nhome and the dad was home, but she doesn&#39;t remember that.  She used to call <br/>\nand ask for a ride because the dad had come home.    She didn&#39;t like the way he <br/>\ntalked to his kids, and she didn&#39;t want to be there.  But the last time I <br/>\nasked her about it she said there were no problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m too-slowly building up to is that the result of all this will be <br/>\nthat I won&#39;t worry about the kids and dating at all.  They&#39;re cautious, <br/>\nhonest, responsible and they lack the sort of desperation that causes people to put <br/>\nup with bullshit just to &quot;have a date&quot; or have a boyfriend/girlfriend, or to <br/>\nstay out of the house longer, just because they don&#39;t have to be home until <br/>\nmidnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents used to say &quot;When you show us you&#39;re responsible, we&#39;ll give you <br/>\nmore freedom.&quot;   To them, being responsible meant doing exactly what they said <br/>\nwithout question.  That&#39;s obedience, not responsibility.  It involves NO <br/>\njudgment, just rule-following.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77522235,"authorName":"Julie Bogart","from":"&quot;Julie Bogart&quot; &lt;julie@...&gt;","profile":"juliecinci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: My daughter again","postDate":"1087221915","msgId":95759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNha2JhcitpMm4yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWM0NTIxNiRjODQzMmJlMCQwMjAxYThjMEBhby5sb3AuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":95758,"nextInTopic":95760,"prevInTime":95758,"nextInTime":95760,"topicId":95747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... a wreck learning how to trust her. ... young drivers (the trauma nurse in me). ...

She takes her phone.  She asks me to take her places instead of sneaking off like she used to.  The few times she *has* snuck off, she has called me to have me come and get her, knowing she had to admit she snuck off.  She confides in me and is much quicker to tell me the truth.  Where she has been in situations where there was drinking or drugs, she has been careful, and while I wish she&#39;d be *more* careful, she is getting there as she is learning how to use fairly sound judgement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have some things to work on (we both still screw up)  but I have to say that things are WAY better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving seen this transformation, I really believe I did the right thing by letting go and letting her make some decisions while not flipping out over things.  (I do let her know when I&#39;m mad but not by flipping out.)<br/>\n  <br/>\nWhat amazes me is how much I underestimated her.

We had a really good talk at swim team practice the other night about drinking and drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our relationship is becoming so much stronger than it was before.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember the friends who didn&#39;t want to come over to our house?  Well, today they *did* come over.  They were hesitant, but they came over while I was having a birthday party for my youngest daughter, so they pitched in a little and helped out.  I think that helped break the tension for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, tonight there was a free concert at a large park about a half hour from here.  It was a Celtic band (can&#39;t remember the name though)..they were from canada.  I had mentioned to dd that I might go because I love Celtic music.  She rounded up her friends and they all wanted to go too (suprise surprise!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we went.  We all had a great time.  One of the girls said it was one of the best times she&#39;s had in a long time.  I enjoyed teasing them.  They enjoyed telling me I should come up to the stage with them and dance LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey thanked me up and down for taking them.  I really appreciated that.  I enjoyed watching them all dance in a circle and have a good time together while they included my 9 year old daughter too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also got stuck in the mud when were trying to park.  Even inf 4WD we couldn&#39;t get out.  We even tried putting the floor mats under the tires.  No luck.  We had to get out and find all kinds of debris (like sticks and such) to &quot;make&quot; a road.  It was fun, and they learned something about getting unstuck LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way home, we cranked the music and it was fun to hear them all sing together...even if it was Eminem (or however you spell it!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we&#39;ll have more good times like that.
