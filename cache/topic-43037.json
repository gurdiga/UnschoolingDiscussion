It&#39;s not that they haven&#39;t been told from early on that these are not acceptable methods of &quot;communication&quot;  - but they are still learning.  Still learning to voice feelings and LISTEN to others feelings without turning things into a he said/she said attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one said &quot;stay in the squabble&quot; - once I&#39;ve ended it - we do discuss feelings, & then work through alternatives in behavior/attitude for the next time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading yr post  - one could jump in and say Marty was learning avoidance techniques and Kirby was learning his outbursts won him his way.  But I&#39;m sure you intervened in those circumstances and in doing so repeatedly equipped them to deal with their differences in a more respectful way.  That&#39;s what I am doing.  I don&#39;t take &quot;sides&quot; in the disagreement, (to put it more clearly, I don&#39;t get into the &quot;excuses&quot; as to why the problem arose in the 1st place)  that is not to say that I will not and do not emphatically say that hitting, etc is NOT an OK way to deal with ones differences and then help them through acceptable methods for dealing with the issue.  Lest I open another can of worms - I must admit that I do not get directly involved in every squabble - sometimes the squabble can be pre-empted by the mere reminder of &quot;Use your words!&quot; and the knowledge in their little heads that mom is listening.  When they do work it out in those circumstances I applaud their efforts to reinforce the desirable behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I know, part of the issue in our house is that I have 3 kids w/ special issues (2 still at home) and triplets too - and they are identical - which in some regards compounds their need to &quot;display&quot; their uniqueness and of course challenges the 8 yo to &quot;stand out&quot; to be noticed (in public more so than at home).  Do they enjoy their similarities and enjoy fooling others as to their identities - yes!  Definitively. Does their brother enjoy that too yes, at times.  But it does present a unique set of challenges.  Uniqueness of our family dynamics aside, people of all ages have disagreements, squabbles, fights - whatever word you choose to use - I believe part of my job as a parent is to teach my kids how to handle those situations and to do that they need to be equipped to handle those differences.  They (differences) will arise in other areas of their life as both kids & adults and I won&#39;t be there to resolve it for them - so they need to know  how to express themselves and respect other&#39;s feelings and work through the differences - sometimes having to agree to disagree on an issue.  But that said - it does not make it any easier when the 4 of them are at each other right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me just wants to vent my frustration at these ongoing battles. The other part is curious how others deal with it - I&#39;m seeking others experiences in this issue to see if there might be something I/we could adopt in our family that would help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan N.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Intro - long (squabbles)","postDate":"1031330622","msgId":43079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxNTRvSWhsREVSdHp1S1k1TjQwMDAwODk3NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43069,"nextInTopic":43101,"prevInTime":43078,"nextInTime":43080,"topicId":43037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

One <br/>\nmight have to look at the word their choosing also when discussing what goes <br/>\non. I think you mean squabble as in disagreement yet with a little more <br/>\nenthusiasm than would be a disagreement between husband and wife. (hopefully <br/>\nanyway!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when I speak of my 2 middle children I use the term fight. Which if I <br/>\nthink about it isn&#39;t really a fight, just a disagreement with some punch to <br/>\nit. (that&#39;s not literal) Although I do have the occassional physical stuff <br/>\nbetween them both too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly can&#39;t see where anyone with more than one child in the home, <br/>\nwithout a large age difference between them, hasn&#39;t experienced a fight or <br/>\nsquabble between them. I would say I don&#39;t believe it if I was told so. Now <br/>\nas the children get older, that&#39;s a different story. They do learn just like <br/>\nmost of us as adults learn what is acceptable or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 middle ones are 13 months apart and it&#39;s been trying at times to come <br/>\nup with what works and figure out what to do and what not to do. They are <br/>\nnow going on 7 and 8 and it has gotten so much better. And I did read the 2 <br/>\nbooks that someone suggested. Helped a little but honestly not much. Maybe <br/>\nthat was just me and I didn&#39;t get it. Read them twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll kids are different and I do believe a lot of it has to do with the <br/>\nchild&#39;s personality anyway. Some kids are just naturally more agreeable than <br/>\nothers. And one child is different from 2 and way differnt from 3 and so on. <br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine dealing with 3 the same age when I see what can happen with <br/>\n2 a year apart. My hat goes off to you Susan without knowing anything <br/>\nelse!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to be there to handle things without picking sides and accusing. <br/>\nMy house is very big and the kids are all over. One will say she did it/he <br/>\ndid it and what do I know? Something isn&#39;t right! I try to handle the <br/>\nsituation depending on the circumstances which sometimes can seem to be <br/>\nforever different.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily the almost 17year old has never fought with any of them. Ah small <br/>\nmiracles. And also fortunate for me, the almost 2 yr old doesn&#39;t really <br/>\nfight with any of them either except for the occasional grabby it&#39;s mine <br/>\nthing she does.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really like is to be able to come to this list with the next <br/>\nproblem between the two of them that frustrates me. To be able to ask for <br/>\nsuggestions and get a &quot;Have you tried this or maybe this might work&quot; instead <br/>\nof an accusing you should never do this kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have our own little wisdoms that we can learn from. I don&#39;t see <br/>\nanyone as all knowing and perfect and it would be wonderful to be able to <br/>\nshare without harming.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the world�s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Intro - long (squabbles)","postDate":"1031324451","msgId":43063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0LjIxMzY1OGEyLjJhYWExZDIzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43037,"nextInTopic":43069,"prevInTime":43062,"nextInTime":43064,"topicId":43037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/6/02 2:13:50 AM, snowicke@cox.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1494209358\">In a message dated 9/6/02 2:13:50 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:snowicke@...\">snowicke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; It does not benefit any of the children to have me take sides or to settle <br/>\nthe issue for them.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I or my children are ever assaulted, I hope the police and judicial system <br/>\ndon&#39;t have that attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if a child DID do something unfair or harmful or wrong to another?

I am there - not in some distant place at this time - I am just not participating in the he did/she said part of things... The typical response of &quot;But maaaa-om he did this or she did that&quot;  doesn&#39;t fly with me.  I do believe that children and adults alike need to work out problems/differences by communicating - and sometimes we need a neutral party to help us to use our words to work things through in a calm and respectful manner.  It does not benefit any of the children to have me take sides or to settle the issue for them.  They need to know that although I hear what their complaint is - I can not solve every personal difference they have in life - instead I choose to equip them with the skills (and guidance until the skills are developed) to handle those challenges without losing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am surprised by is your statement <br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s one reason we don&#39;t have squabbles, is that squabbles aren&#39;t okay to have.&quot; <br/>\nSquabbles arise from differences in individual approaches to a particular issue, situation or in the method - especially with kids, younger kids even more so.  To not allow differences in opinion or approach is to further frustrate a situation - each child is a unique individual.  What they must learn is how to express their individualism/desires without attacking another&#39;s.  I don&#39;t see how one can have more than 1 child in a home and not have times when they are at each other - I actually have 6 kids in all - ranging from 24 yrs to 5 (the oldest 2 - 24 and 21 - living on their own/away at school) All 6 have always had differences eventhough they love each other dearly.   A common problem between my now 21 and 8 yr old was that one day he was aloud in her room and aloud to touch certain things and another day in another mood he wasn&#39;t.  She (21 then 16) had to learn inconsistency on her part was creating the reaction and intrusion on his part.  2 1/2 yr olds don&#39;t understand inconsistency but, he had to learn to ask before touching sisters stuff - even at 2. Both had to learn to use their words - calmly and respectfully to the best of their maturity level.  Redirection for the younger and asking for help by the older were solutions that constantly had to be reinforced. <br/>\nBtwn my 5 and 8 yo&#39;s I do expect them to be able to talk through their problems - I do not see how screaming, hitting, name calling or tearful accusations resolve anything and only in fact, serve to worsen a situation. <br/>\nMy goal as a parent is to equip my children with the necessary skills to be able to effectively communicate their opinions/wants/desires in intelligent and appropriate ways and to be able to resolve differences without making personal attacks on another.  Do I stay out of the &quot;he said/she said battles&quot; - You bet I do! - I refuse to take sides when in my opinion neither are communicating effectively.  Will I leave them to go on battling endlessly - absolutely not!  Squabbles, battles or fights are halted as soon as they erupt.  Will I resolve the issue for them - absolutely not!  Even when it is clear that one child is in the wrong and the other has merely reacted to their wrong-ness I will not choose sides in the battle.  I will tell them together -that  the 1st wrong-doer&#39;s action was inappropriate and unacceptable and will help him/her to talk through what other options could have accomplished the expression of their feelings - without the fight. Using words to express their feelings is what I seek to get the &quot;attacker&quot; to do and at the same time to realize that a verbal or physical attack is not an effective or acceptable way to express feelings.  I will also talk with the responder and ask how they could have handled the situation differently when confronted by the other - (Leave the room, seek out adult help, or sometimes even to ignore the other person, etc.) rather than launch a counter attack or enlist the aid of siblings in a counter attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nSquabbles - or &quot;differences of opinion with emotional strings&quot; for the adult crowd,  do happen -- and I believe that they happen in every household that has more than one person in it.  It is how we are taught to deal with those times that will determine our personal success in life.  If a child is taught that mommy or daddy will solve all their battles - they will never learn to resolve issues with others for themselves.  They will however become either the bully or the emotional timebomb who stuffs all their feelings deep inside until one day they explode.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo again, I put my ponderance out there - How is it people never have squabbles in their homes?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSusan N.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43213,"nextTopicId":43166}}
