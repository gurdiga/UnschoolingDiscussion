My name is Debbie, I&#39;m 29 years old, married to Tom, also<br/>\n29; we live in North Texas.  We have 9-year old fraternal twin daughters and<br/>\na baby boy who is almost 16 months old.  Maggie and Kate are in 3rd grade at<br/>\na public school currently--but only until tomorrow!  We made the decision to<br/>\nstart homeschooling them when they would come home from school complaining<br/>\nabout being bored all day.  They&#39;re both in the Gifted (whatever that means<br/>\n:)) program at school but it&#39;s just not enough; they&#39;re waaaay beyond the<br/>\nother students.  After deciding to homeschool, I started doing research and<br/>\ndiscovered unschooling.  Ah, finally, something that seems like how we<br/>\nalready live our non-school lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone we&#39;ve told so far has been supportive of our endeavor, but we<br/>\nhaven&#39;t told Tom&#39;s parents yet.  MIL is an elementary school teacher; FIL is<br/>\na high school teacher.  One SIL  is an elementary teacher; the other is an<br/>\naide in MIL&#39;s class.  It&#39;s not going to be easy for them to understand why<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing.  Any thoughts on how we can word it so that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound like an attack on them personally?  Obviously, it&#39;s not, but<br/>\nI&#39;m afraid that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to hear it no matter what we say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going back into lurk mode until I get a handle on who everyone is.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52456,"nextTopicId":52517}}
