This is the program that actually helped her learn to read.  I liked the fact that we could just open the book and start reading. There was no prep work involved. The book is printed in a 24 point type face with lots of white space on the pages. The words are grouped by letter sounds which makes it a useful reference book also.  New words are listed before the sentence so the child has a chance to read the new word before tackling the entire sentence.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nSome very easy readers dd like were; Suzy Mule, Foxy Fox, Lucky Duck, Penny Hen, etc. The authors last name was DeRubertis.<br/>\n  <br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: audrey elwood<br/>\nSent: Saturday, August 10, 2002 3:46 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2226<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nhey zenmomma!<br/>\nmy kids love a book called phonics pathways, and a reading exercise book  <br/>\nthat goes along w/ it called pyramid-it is a game! they have a great time w/  <br/>\nit and v&#92;bring it to me to do w/ them---about 35.00 for both of them i  <br/>\nthink. i found them in &quot;the well trained mind&quot;<br/>\ngood luck!<br/>\naudrey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40559,"nextTopicId":40611}}
