The course is both undergrad and graduate credit.<br/>\nThe professor is my favorite one and he gave me permission to have<br/>\nNoah sit in (even without credit or paying tuition) if he wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, both Noah and I came to realize that if he&#39;s doing the work,<br/>\nhaving the credit might come in handy some day. So I started down the<br/>\npath of special student status and hit a brick wall in the first phone<br/>\ncall. Normally I quit at that point. The admissions lady just kept<br/>\ntelling me he had to jump through all the admissions hoops even if he<br/>\nisn&#39;t a degree seeking student.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this time, I decided to keep calling other departments. Long story<br/>\nshort:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe CAPS program (degree completion and weekend degree students over<br/>\n22) made an exception for Noah and will enroll him even though he&#39;s<br/>\nnot old enough. They will even allow us to use Jon&#39;s adjunct teaching<br/>\nfor tuition remission and Noah will get credit even though he won&#39;t be<br/>\nin the degree seeking program.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that cool? The dean was so nice to me and enthusiastic for Noah.<br/>\nQuote: &quot;He&#39;s clearly an exception and this class sounds ideal for<br/>\nhim.&quot; Noah was over the moon. He&#39;s totally stoked to learn a dead<br/>\nlanguage. :) I liked that going past the initial phone call yielded<br/>\nsuch an enthusiatic exception!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d throw out that info in case someone might wonder how<br/>\nto do the special student status in college.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106634,"nextTopicId":7919}}
