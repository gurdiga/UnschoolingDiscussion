We went to the library and got<br/>\n&gt; books on rats and read alot. We chose a young male rat and for the first<br/>\n&gt; little bit he was pretty sweet. I figured it was his settling in period.<br/>\n&gt; But pretty soon he was nipping us, even when we were careful to wash our<br/>\n&gt; hands so no food smell was on them.<br/>\n&gt;   I can not figure what we did wrong. We bought a really large homemade<br/>\n&gt; wood and wire cage that allowed tons of room and he had lots of climbing<br/>\n&gt; room.<br/>\n&gt;   I found him another home as we had little ones and I was concerned they<br/>\n&gt; would get their fingers nipped.

I have<br/>\nonly ever been seriously bitten (blood) once in my lifelong ownership of<br/>\nmany, many rats, and that was when I stuck my hands into a cage and was<br/>\nmessing with stuff not knowing my little rattie girl had had babies the<br/>\nnight before.
