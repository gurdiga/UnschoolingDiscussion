The girls <br/>\nshare a room, so sometimes I feel bad for my little guy. But, he&#39;s given up <br/>\nhis daytime nap and pretty much needs to fall asleep earlier.  If I had a <br/>\nbigger house, I&#39;d probably set up a big room for them bunk style, gender be <br/>\ndamned. The times he&#39;s asked to sleep with the girls, we&#39;ve just said sure. <br/>\nUsually, he ends up moving back into his room after an hour or so. He <br/>\nreally likes his space (weaned himself from the family bed at around 6.5 <br/>\nmonths; I think it&#39;s dh&#39;s snoring! lol).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe turned the girls&#39; closet into a reading loft, with a platform and <br/>\nrecessed lighting, so my oldest would be able to read after her sister was <br/>\nasleep. There are full bookshelves in both rooms, along with some special, <br/>\nmore quiet, toys. And they are free to bring stuff to bed with them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh gives them their bath and story and puts them to bed, but there are no <br/>\nrequirements after that. They like the bedtime ritual and the time they <br/>\nspend with their father, so there would be no way out of that--even if we <br/>\ntold them they could be anywhere in the house, know what I mean? Once they <br/>\nare in their rooms, they know it&#39;s mama&#39;s and papa&#39;s special time <br/>\ntogether--time to reconnect as adults. This is something that we have <br/>\nalways done to nurture our marriage, which I feel is very important. We go <br/>\nout maybe twice a year, so we have to carve out our connection time at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily (the oldest) is often up until 10 or 11:00. If Sam (the youngest) <br/>\nended up falling asleep during the day, he&#39;ll be up until 11:00, too. <br/>\nSometimes they&#39;ll come into our bedroom and watch something on Discovery or <br/>\nwhatever. Most nights they&#39;re content to play in their rooms and check in <br/>\non us only periodically.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis system has really worked wonderfully for all of us, and we&#39;ve never <br/>\nhad bed time issues.

My dh is a early riser, going to work<br/>\nearly (5 a.m.) most days.  I am a night owl, as are most of the kids, most<br/>\nof the time (my youngest goes in spurts with early bedtimes sometimes).<br/>\nRight now, I am working out of the home 4 nights a week, until 1 a.m. ... so<br/>\nthe two youngest are going to bed with daddy at 9 p.m.  This means, they<br/>\nwake up between 7:30 and 8:30, when I may not have been asleep for even 4<br/>\nhours yet. This is becoming a real issue for us. We have a very small house<br/>\n(and I do mean, very small!) so it is not like they can be somewhere while<br/>\none of us is sleeping and not disturbing us.  Honestly, I do prefer the kids<br/>\ngoing to bed with Alex at night as I don&#39;t think he would be aware of<br/>\n&quot;issues&quot; that may crop up while he was asleep ... I can hear changes in tone<br/>\nof voice, squabbles, whatever while I am sleeping and can wake up enough to<br/>\nhelp guide them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know someone who had a first child who was a night owl and her second<br/>\nchild was up at 6 a.m. She ended up telling her oldest, you have to be in<br/>\nyour room by &lt;whatever time&gt; but you don&#39;t have to go to sleep ... you just<br/>\nhave to stay there.&quot;  He was 6 or 7 at the time. At the end of 30 days, he<br/>\ngot something he had been wanting for a while.  This met both of their needs<br/>\n... she knew he wasn&#39;t wandering around the house at all hours of the night<br/>\nso she could rest easier and sleep with the new baby and he got to still<br/>\nstay up in his room, which was a safe place for him to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like your idea of stating an &quot;in your room&quot; time .... it just might work<br/>\nout for all of you.  I like my quiet time at night ... and I will stay up<br/>\nuntil 1 or 2 to get it, if I have to! :)  But, then if the kids wake up<br/>\nearly ... and I have to get up with them (I don&#39;t anymore but I used to have<br/>\nto!) I would be grumpy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of years ago, one night I just declared, out of the blue, STORY<br/>\nTIME! at 8 p.m. We turned the lights out around 8:30 ... all were asleep by<br/>\n8:45 or 9.
