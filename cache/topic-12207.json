Whatever works.  I have read a lot lately about teens <br/>\nneeding lots and lots and lots of sleep, tho.  So, maybe that&#39;s an important <br/>\nfactor in your house.  Not mine yet (7 yo and 5 1/2 yo) but we sleep when <br/>\nwe&#39;re tired.  Not to be flip, I have just never figured out how to tell a <br/>\nperson (even myself), &quot;OK, it&#39;s 9:00 -- sleep.&quot;  Altho, I personally, can <br/>\nsleep at the drop of a hat!  No help here!!<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Computer limits -- what we do -- Mom hogs the computer.  Seriously, I <br/>\nhave been doing some things lately and have not been sharing well.  But <br/>\ngenerally we take turns and are so busy doing lots of things that we haven&#39;t <br/>\ngotten into too many hours of computer time.  It&#39;s probably more of a problem <br/>\nwith teens tho.  But I do know it goes in spurts - a new game or website = <br/>\nhours of fun (and learning too but don&#39;t tell the kids).  Of course, they&#39;re <br/>\ncompletely supervised on the Net --all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n(3)  Math -- Do what you want.  My son is taking a math course on line and <br/>\nalso does all sorts of reading and games and blackboard time and 5 1/2 yo <br/>\ndaughter is at the playing lots of games and learning to write the letters <br/>\nand add & subtract stage.  We have some workbooks sitting around.  But for <br/>\nthe more advanced stuff especially, what&#39;s wrong with a course.  Maybe you <br/>\njust haven&#39;t found one the kids click with.  They are old enough -- perhaps <br/>\nthey could help you select the right one for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, good luck with everything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"braunville@aol.com","from":"braunville@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"d25_JsTwuUU23ItjUQOOr8adm_Gn57rQyymIbQThcatoX1S10F8GtGqFezMneEqxczEOJVZma58m","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 745","postDate":"967450603","msgId":12208,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFlLjlkOWI5ZjYuMjZkYjc5ZWJAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12207,"nextInTopic":12209,"prevInTime":12207,"nextInTime":12209,"topicId":12207,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/27/2000 11:25:03 PM Pacific Daylight Time, ...

One of our main <br/>\nreasons to stay away from the ps thing is to have more control over our <br/>\npersonal lives and better time to spend together as a family.  In our family, <br/>\nwe all live by Dad&#39;s schedule because he is the one with a schedule set by <br/>\noutside influences (work).  DH has worked rotating shift work most of our <br/>\nlives.  When he&#39;s on a night shift he would totally miss any family time if <br/>\nwe stick to a strict bedtime routine, especially when he works a swing shift. <br/>\n Our ps routine for swing shift WAS:  Dad comes home from work after <br/>\nmidnight, sleeps until 9 or 10, by which time children have gone off to <br/>\nschool; dad would go to work just before children return from school and <br/>\nchildren were in bed before dad returned from work.  YUCK!  (Just one of the <br/>\nmany reasons we homeschool!)  Now, we all shift schedules according to Dad&#39;s <br/>\nwork schedule.  (although it is a little hard for the family to do the <br/>\nmidnight to 7 a.m. routine, so we compromise as needed!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think it depends on the needs of the child.  We have health problems <br/>\nin our family which are exacerbated by disrupted sleep routines.  So, when <br/>\nsomeone is in a health flare, it becomes important that there be some routine <br/>\nto encourage good sleep patterns.  Also, I can&#39;t sleep knowing there are <br/>\nchildren up and about.  It&#39;s more a matter of wanting to be there/be involved <br/>\nwith them than lack of trust.  Since I&#39;m most often the one with health <br/>\nproblems, my sleep needs take precedent over kid&#39;s schedule.  OTOH if someone <br/>\nelse has a bigger/stronger need, we adjust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe family time is most important to us.  We don&#39;t really care when the <br/>\nfamily sleeps, but we have better quality of life and family time if we are <br/>\nall on a similar schedule.  Our friends and extended family have learned to <br/>\nnot call at 8 a.m. and that they may catch us napping mid-afternoon, and I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned to turn the phone off until I&#39;m up in the morning!  They&#39;ve also <br/>\nlearned that if they need to talk to someone at 2 a.m., the odds are really <br/>\ngood that I&#39;m up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my opinion that, as the parent, I have the responsibility to monitor <br/>\nthe health conditions of my children and insist on a bedtime that is best for <br/>\nthe individual and the family, as needed.  I would definitely not be <br/>\ncomfortable having kids up until who knows when.  Having people up and about <br/>\nduring sleep hours is not much of an issue because, regardless of which <br/>\nschedule we are currently on, we have a bedtime routine which includes <br/>\nreading, cuddling, family time and tucking in kidlet who is about to turn 12, <br/>\nbut not about to give up that routine(!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone has a hard time going to sleep at the designated hour, we <br/>\nencourage reading or other quiet activity.  Especially when we are having to <br/>\nswitch from one schedule to another.  (I would probably be a family bed <br/>\nspokesperson if everyone else&#39;s snoring didn&#39;t keep me awake.  But that&#39;s <br/>\nalmost a different topic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has probably not been an answer that&#39;s helpful for you, except to point <br/>\nout that the needs of each family differ.  (What a long-winded way to say: Do <br/>\nwhat is best for you and your family.  &lt;bg&gt; )<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for limiting usage of computer/internet (or computer games).  Again, it <br/>\ndepends.  I&#39;m protective of where on the net my children go, so we use AOL&#39;s <br/>\nfilter and also ask children to let us know when they are on the internet.  <br/>\nPlus, I hang out with them enough that it is not difficult for me to steer <br/>\nthem a different direction if I don&#39;t like where they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found we sometimes need to limit the time on the computer or using <br/>\nvideo games due to general crabbiness.  IMO, too much time in front of any <br/>\nelectronic media has the same effect as too much time in front of TV or <br/>\nstuffed behind a school desk...brain wave coma.  (Quickly recognizable by the <br/>\nloss of ability to hear mom&#39;s voice and the vacant stares when you actually <br/>\nget them to look your way!  LOL)  We don&#39;t have fast rules about how much is <br/>\ntoo much, but watch our children&#39;s behavior and let that be our guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for math, we still use Saxon.  I love math and have no trouble getting DS <br/>\nto be enthusiastic about the subject.  We love the scientific aspects of it <br/>\nand multiplying fractions is just the sort of topic our brain waves enjoy.  <br/>\n(sometimes comes in handy for solving video or puzzle game problems, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it&#39;s time for SAT&#39;s or college placement tests, they&#39;ll either learn the <br/>\nsubject quickly in order to move on and meet their goal, or they&#39;ll take <br/>\nremedial classes/find a tutor to get what they need when they need it.  So, <br/>\neither method works.  We use a hybrid:  Use a textbook, but without strictly <br/>\nfollowing the outline/schedule and look for opportunities to explore math <br/>\nconcepts in daily living. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps any, I have 2 child-units.  One is an adult now.  We unschooled <br/>\npretty thoroughly from about age 15 on (read:  could NOT get the kid to do <br/>\nany &#39;school&#39; work and eventually gave up with the theory that saving our <br/>\nrelationship with him was more important than cramming the &#39;necessary&#39; school <br/>\nwork into his rebellious brain!)  The stinker went on to take his GED after 5 <br/>\nyears of no formal school work, refused to study with a GED study guide or <br/>\nlook at any text books in order to prepare for the test, passed the GED test <br/>\nwith flying colors the first try, has taken college courses, started his own <br/>\nfamily and has since gone on to become an electrician apprenticeship.  I <br/>\ncount that as success.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe learned what he needed when he was ready for it.  Waiting only helped him <br/>\nto be more ready for it.  I learned to relax the hard way!  We do things much <br/>\ndifferently for the younger son.  (That&#39;s the cool thing about 10 years <br/>\nbetween kids, there is lots of time to analyze parenting decisions and learn <br/>\nfor the second son.)  Luckily for us, the older one is so stubborn.  &lt;bg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW<br/>\nEiraul</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"linda loux","from":"&quot;linda loux&quot; &lt;starshine_lal@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FWJ8SbhqjM1dwQNp-dwpHefDmnwA3K8w0zi0kRq0ZIb4SIOyQN6s0MD7WLbFEl0B_rTOt2tUvNa4IfQ5Vswr0_GT-5EGNhCo3HfVIVurhw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 745","postDate":"967443305","msgId":12207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMjlCTFNBUVY2dVBEVm5pU24wMDAwMDMzNUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12208,"prevInTime":12206,"nextInTime":12208,"topicId":12207,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new to this site.

Then, as time progresses, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;the dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;kids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and<br/>\n&gt;becomes an advocate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This happened with my husband, too.

I naturally have a loud voice since<br/>\n&gt;birth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would<br/>\n&gt;move away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the<br/>\n&gt;second of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so<br/>\n&gt;many kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am<br/>\n&gt;talking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize<br/>\n&gt;that when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that<br/>\n&gt;keeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also<br/>\n&gt;learned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer<br/>\n&gt;calmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and<br/>\n&gt;controled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I<br/>\n&gt;tend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control<br/>\n&gt;in those frustrating times though. Think I always will.

Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started<br/>\n&gt;out I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would <br/>\n&gt;be<br/>\n&gt;fun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects<br/>\n&gt;into one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;interesting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more likely,<br/>\n&gt;it would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of<br/>\n&gt;trying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I<br/>\n&gt;began my own de-schooling too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do some<br/>\n&gt;of the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn what<br/>\n&gt;they want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, and<br/>\n&gt;seem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. So,<br/>\n&gt;we may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;telling them what they are to do.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;School starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast in<br/>\n&gt;our garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a<br/>\n&gt;little thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this year<br/>\n&gt;and what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video taped<br/>\n&gt;them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first day<br/>\n&gt;went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of<br/>\n&gt;school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful<br/>\n&gt;family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting<br/>\n&gt;each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference there<br/>\n&gt;is now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Cathie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12197,"nextTopicId":12224}}
