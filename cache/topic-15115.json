Cuz they wanted to<br/>\nbe able to NOT learn and just play. You seem sooo the<br/>\nopposite. You actually sought out a list about<br/>\nunschooling. Some kids would have just been perfectly<br/>\nhappy letting thier parents say &quot;homeschooling&quot; and<br/>\njust watch TV all day, turn in a test every once in a<br/>\nwhile, to keep people happy. I&#39;m very impressed with<br/>\nyour morale.  I am very out of the loop here on this<br/>\nlist, so maybe someone&#39;s already suggested it. But a<br/>\nhuge thing that helped me -(though my family wasn&#39;t<br/>\nagainst unschooling by any means, but they did worry<br/>\nthat they should have been making me &quot;do schoolwork&quot;<br/>\ninstead of stuff on my own, so it helped me reassured<br/>\nthem)- was seeking out learning experiences (which you<br/>\nobviously like doing) and then sharing them with them<br/>\nall excitedly. Checking out these tapes from the<br/>\nlibrary with my then best friend (6 yrs older and<br/>\n&quot;taking a correspondence course&quot; to get her diploma)to<br/>\nlearn Swahili, or sitting down and reading a national<br/>\ngeographic in thier presence, or writing a report on<br/>\nsomething I found interesting, for no other purpose<br/>\nthan to write it. Not for them to read. Not for<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; but just cuz I wanted to learn about<br/>\nsomething particular and did it on my own. Making a<br/>\nscience experiment that they knew wasn&#39;t required of<br/>\nme. Then my parents were like &quot;ok, she&#39;ll be fine. she<br/>\nlearns what she wants to learn.&quot; They bought me a<br/>\ncouple of correspondence courses Calvert and American<br/>\nSchool and they never witnessed me really absorbing<br/>\nthem the way I did these other things. If you let them<br/>\nsee you learning on your &quot;own time&quot; (as opposed to<br/>\nduring the day when you are supposed to be doing<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; and then be thru with it when they are home<br/>\nlater), and enjoying it and maybe taking an interest<br/>\nin something they hope you will learn about thru<br/>\nhomeschooling. for instance if they encourage you to<br/>\ntake something as an elective in a homeschooling<br/>\ncourse or something, then let them see you looking at<br/>\nsite on the net about that very thing when you could<br/>\neasily be chatting with friends instead. If they have<br/>\nhopes of you liking medical science, then let them<br/>\ncatch you reading a medical encyclopedia at some time<br/>\nwhen one of your favorite  tv shows is on. This will<br/>\nshow them that learning is important to you and you<br/>\naren&#39;t just trying to &quot;get out of the work&quot;, and that<br/>\nyou can learn it fine on your own, without structured<br/>\nlessons. Right now if you tell them something you<br/>\nlearned during the day, they may just assumed it was<br/>\nthru the homeschooling program they have set up for<br/>\nyou. But if they can see with thier own eyes that you<br/>\ncan do it and want to do it then it may help ease<br/>\nthier minds. Keep in mind that the same peer pressure<br/>\nthat kids get at school, adults get at work and from<br/>\nfamily and friends. I&#39;m sure they want what&#39;s best for<br/>\nyou just as much as we all want it for our kids, but<br/>\nthey obviously need convincing in a different way than<br/>\nfrom words and talking, if that hasn&#39;t worked. Maybe<br/>\nSEEING it work will be effective. Sometimes adults<br/>\nhave to have &quot;hands-on&quot; learning, too, in order to<br/>\nfinally grasp a point. :) Hope that was somewhat<br/>\nhelpful and not just incoherent. I must go to bed now.<br/>\nI think I typed that last part in my sleep. <br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Erin M &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arabhorses_rock@...\">arabhorses_rock@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wanting to unschool, <br/>\n&gt; but I could only convince my parents to let me<br/>\n&gt; homeschool, and they bought <br/>\n&gt; textbooks, but I have stopped using them now.

Heady stuff, but a must-read, in my opinion. Maybe if you <br/>\n&gt;read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;it, then you can read the best parts aloud to your parents to help<br/>\n&gt; &gt;deschool<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--Valerie in Tacoma<br/>\n&gt;I have read it(cover to cover a couple of times, and a ton of selected<br/>\n&gt;reading and browsing), worn it to bits actually! That was the first thing I<br/>\n&gt;did after I heard of unschooling for the first time, in an article in Girls<br/>\n&gt;Life written by an unschooler(Erin Doty,she lives in Portland, and we are<br/>\n&gt;now in sort of occasional touch-if any of you know her). She suggested it,<br/>\n&gt;along with Real Lives, and I convinced my mom to get it for me right away.<br/>\n&gt;She didn&#39;t know what she was getting into! :-) I have higlighted, dogeared,<br/>\n&gt;bent, and read tons of it to my parents, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.<br/>\n&gt;My answer to this got &quot;delayed&quot; so it will probably show up again in a few<br/>\n&gt;days but it might be a dead topic by then so I decide to &quot;re answer&quot;!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another excellent one is &quot;Real Lives&quot; also by Grace Llewellyn. That one <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about the lives of 11 teenages who do not go to school.  Some went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;school and quit, others never attended school.   My husband just <br/>\n&gt; &gt;finished<br/>\n&gt; &gt;both Real Lives and Teen Lib Handbook, they really are must reads.<br/>\n&gt;I haven&#39;t yet read it, but I have heard tons about it. I can&#39;t find it in<br/>\n&gt;bookstores in dinky Baxley,GA(thank goodness for Amazon-may they never go<br/>\n&gt;out of business) but I will either save my money and get Mom to order it <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;me(I&#39;m currently broke:-) or ask for it for my birthday in April, because I<br/>\n&gt;would really like to read it. And the more sucess stories I can cram into <br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;parents heads the better.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I really wish Grace Llewellyn would go back and revisit the teens in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Real Lives book.  It has been nearly 10 years since it was written, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they are all in the mid 20&#39;s now and I would be very interested to see <br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they are doing now.<br/>\n&gt;That would be interesting!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another good one is : &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to use the whole <br/>\n&gt;world<br/>\n&gt; &gt;as your child&#39;s classroom&quot;  By Mary Griffith   Most anything by John Holt<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of Gatto is a good bet too.<br/>\n&gt;I would also like to buy the Unschooling Handbook as soon as I can. I read<br/>\n&gt;parts of it at a bookstore when we were at the beach this past summer, and<br/>\n&gt;it was really good, but I wasn&#39;t able to buy it then(because I had no <br/>\n&gt;money,<br/>\n&gt;as usual for me). And yes I have thought of starting a business!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Something else you might do to convince them is get into some <br/>\n&gt;volunteering<br/>\n&gt; &gt;or some internship programs.   Show them that there are more valuable <br/>\n&gt;ways<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to spend your time other than doing boring text work.<br/>\n&gt;I am working on starting to volunteer at the local hospital an I would like<br/>\n&gt;to work with a vet or maybe with my grown cousin who has just started her<br/>\n&gt;own business, a neat little card and scrapbook supply store. She makes<br/>\n&gt;cards, stationary, all kinds of neat things and she has tons of stickers <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;scrapbook supplies. She&#39;s very creative and fun and she&#39;s really busy now<br/>\n&gt;because the shop just took off.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, I hope maybe something in that helps.  I know how you feel.  My<br/>\n&gt; &gt;family is not unsupportive, but my dad and step-sister are both teachers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;so I think they were expecting a bit more traditional methods (why they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;thought that of me, the big old black sheep of the family I have no<br/>\n&gt; &gt;clue!!).  So, mostly they just ignore the fact that we do what we do.<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s actually how I feel my parents act. And they are both teachers, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;is very annoying. Last night Mama was grading papers(her third graders are<br/>\n&gt;using the Shurley Method-they are diagramming sentences in third grade), <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt;I very maturely stuck my finger in my mouth and pertended to throw up-I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t like the Shurley Method. Not a good move. Anyway, we got into an<br/>\n&gt;argument about diagramming sentences. She said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t know how <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;do that&quot;. I know most of the parts of speech and I write and speak<br/>\n&gt;correctly(when I wish to). I just don&#39;t see the point and I told her so. I<br/>\n&gt;asked her when she ever used this in life, besides when she was teaching <br/>\n&gt;her<br/>\n&gt;kids. She said I would need it in college and on tests. And I said, &quot;Yes,<br/>\n&gt;but what practical purpose will it serve me in the real world?&quot;. She<br/>\n&gt;obviously didn&#39;t have an answer for that, and so she didn&#39;t(answer, that is<br/>\n&gt;:-). She just got all uptight and said, &quot;You just will!&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t- if <br/>\n&gt;you<br/>\n&gt;knew of some reason I&#39;ll need it you would tell me.&quot; &quot;You -will- need it,<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t argue with me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;There&#39;s just no point in argueing with her then, anyway.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Just hang in there!

That one is<br/>\n&gt;about the lives of 11 teenages who do not go to school.  Some went to<br/>\n&gt;school and quit, others never attended school.   My husband just &gt;finished<br/>\n&gt;both Real Lives and Teen Lib Handbook, they really are must reads.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t yet read it, but I have heard tons about it. I can&#39;t find it in <br/>\nbookstores in dinky Baxley,GA(thank goodness for Amazon-may they never go <br/>\nout of business) but I will either save my money and get Mom to order it for <br/>\nme(I&#39;m currently broke:-) or ask for it for my birthday in April, because I <br/>\nwould really like to read it. And the more sucess stories I can cram into my <br/>\nparents heads the better.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I really wish Grace Llewellyn would go back and revisit the teens in the<br/>\n&gt;Real Lives book.  It has been nearly 10 years since it was written, and<br/>\n&gt;they are all in the mid 20&#39;s now and I would be very interested to see what<br/>\n&gt;they are doing now.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be interesting!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Another good one is : &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to use the whole world<br/>\n&gt;as your child&#39;s classroom&quot;  By Mary Griffith   Most anything by John Holt<br/>\n&gt;of Gatto is a good bet too.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would also like to buy the Unschooling Handbook as soon as I can. I read <br/>\nparts of it at a bookstore when we were at the beach this past summer, and <br/>\nit was really good, but I wasn&#39;t able to buy it then(because I had no money, <br/>\nas usual for me). And yes I have thought of starting a business!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Something else you might do to convince them is get into some volunteering<br/>\n&gt;or some internship programs.   Show them that there are more valuable ways<br/>\n&gt;to spend your time other than doing boring text work.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am working on starting to volunteer at the local hospital an I would like <br/>\nto work with a vet or maybe with my grown cousin who has just started her <br/>\nown business, a neat little card and scrapbook supply store. She makes <br/>\ncards, stationary, all kinds of neat things and she has tons of stickers and <br/>\nscrapbook supplies. She&#39;s very creative and fun and she&#39;s really busy now <br/>\nbecause the shop just took off.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Anyway, I hope maybe something in that helps.  I know how you feel.  My<br/>\n&gt;family is not unsupportive, but my dad and step-sister are both teachers,<br/>\n&gt;so I think they were expecting a bit more traditional methods (why they<br/>\n&gt;thought that of me, the big old black sheep of the family I have no<br/>\n&gt;clue!!).  So, mostly they just ignore the fact that we do what we do.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s actually how I feel my parents act. And they are both teachers, which <br/>\nis very annoying. Last night Mama was grading papers(her third graders are <br/>\nusing the Shurley Method-they are diagramming sentences in third grade), and <br/>\nI very maturely stuck my finger in my mouth and pertended to throw up-I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like the Shurley Method. Not a good move. Anyway, we got into an <br/>\nargument about diagramming sentences. She said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t know how to <br/>\ndo that&quot;. I know most of the parts of speech and I write and speak <br/>\ncorrectly(when I wish to). I just don&#39;t see the point and I told her so. I <br/>\nasked her when she ever used this in life, besides when she was teaching her <br/>\nkids. She said I would need it in college and on tests. And I said, &quot;Yes, <br/>\nbut what practical purpose will it serve me in the real world?&quot;. She <br/>\nobviously didn&#39;t have an answer for that, and so she didn&#39;t(answer, that is <br/>\n:-). She just got all uptight and said, &quot;You just will!&quot; &quot;No I won&#39;t- if you <br/>\nknew of some reason I&#39;ll need it you would tell me.&quot; &quot;You -will- need it, <br/>\ndon&#39;t argue with me.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s just no point in argueing with her then, anyway.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Just hang in there!

I do indulge my boys alot, with video<br/>\ngames, movies (not scary ones- I hate scary movies!).<br/>\nI like to visit the unschooling boards alot, because<br/>\nthere is so much being said that isnt on this list-<br/>\nthe nitty gritty, daily grind of life with kids.<br/>\nReading books on unschooling didnt really help me<br/>\nmuch, even made me feel bad that my kids werent<br/>\nwriting music and neighborhood newsletters- without<br/>\nbeing poked with a branding iron, that wont happen<br/>\nhere:) I think someone should write a book on the<br/>\nAVERAGE unschooled kid. The ones who balk at writing<br/>\nanything at all! The ones who love tv and video games,<br/>\nand sports! Did you all know that theres a<br/>\nhomeschooler rookie on the Miami Dolphins??? Well, I<br/>\nguess I am babbling a bit, but I&#39;m learning to go with<br/>\nmy instincts, not by the book. Dont let too many &quot;how<br/>\nto&quot; homeschooling/ unschooling books discourage you.<br/>\nAll those moms and dads wrote about what they know,<br/>\nand if you did the same it may not help everyone,<br/>\nkwim?<br/>\nOk, I&#39;m off the deep end now!<br/>\nKerry</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carolyn","from":"Carolyn &lt;nielsonc@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"fDE2uBYf0Ca6-bbjhNhKM5MplYbtSbaDSF7wqi1V4qwzfvms6W97YtjSn2sJyT-WskNeDYvnWVMY7rQH_h7mQRJeK0QS","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] kids dont always need z&#39;s","postDate":"979667148","msgId":15119,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNjQ4OENCLkY3MkI4QTdEQHBhY2JlbGwubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTE2MTQwMTMxLjI2MjU3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjkwMDcubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15117,"nextInTopic":15124,"prevInTime":15118,"nextInTime":15120,"topicId":15115,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We did this recently too.

Our 10 year old daughter loves to stay up<br/>\nhalf the night, and sleep half the day.  Until she begged us to let her<br/>\nwatch Nightmare on Elm Street, &quot;everybody else has seen it&quot;.  After<br/>\nseveral months of this I let her try the movie.  As I expected, she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t last too long and has slept with us every night for a week now,<br/>\ngoing to bed at our bedtime and up early.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m struggling with how much control to give up.  She says now I<br/>\nprobably shouldn&#39;t have let her watch the movie.  She craves sugar, junk<br/>\nTV, Brittney Spears.  Do I indulge?  What books are you reading?  I<br/>\nreally like the idea of letting her make her own choices.  I wonder,<br/>\nthough, if sometimes it really is to her benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarolyn<br/>\n<br/>\nKerry Kibort wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We were having a heck of a time at &quot;bedtime&quot;.
