Most of my kids and I got<br/>\nours &quot;late&quot;....nearly 12 months, so I figured they&#39;d start losing them<br/>\naround age 7, like I did. But I have some nieces and nephews who got their<br/>\nteeth early, at 4-6 months like your son (my sil is positive this is a sign<br/>\nof high intelligence...oh, and the amount of hair shows that, too...agh!) so<br/>\nthey lost teeth right and left starting at 5 years. They all took very good<br/>\ncare of their teeth...it was normal, having nothing to do with a tooth<br/>\nrotting and falling out. If that were the case, wouldn&#39;t it look and feel<br/>\nrotten? It takes quite a bit of neglect for that to happen, not just<br/>\nforgetting to brush once in awhile. I know I was terrible about it as a<br/>\nchild. I had a mouthful of cavities, but they never just fell out.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Valerie<br/>\n<br/>\nps Our tooth fairy gives a silver dollar for the first tooth lost, and a<br/>\nquarter after that. :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12412,"nextTopicId":12422}}
