Your attorney advised you well.  The more you recognize your <br/>\nfamilies strengths, the more you will be able to improve and, to be honest, <br/>\nthis is how relationships improve.  Each observes and changes as one learns or <br/>\ndiscovers what must be done.  Your reactions are critical at this point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you continually change on the &quot;inside&quot; (living honestly and real, <br/>\nnot phony or &quot;for others&quot;), the more changes will be recognized on the <br/>\n&quot;outside&quot;.  This attitude/heart change is what will baffle DSS the most, and that&#39;s <br/>\njust fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpc in Mo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":86465,"nextTopicId":86409}}
