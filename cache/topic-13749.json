Here in<br/>\nOregon, I don&#39;t think you can administer the tests at home by yourself. And<br/>\nkids have to score above the 15th percentile to avoid some form of<br/>\nintervention from the school district. I admit, I&#39;m not completely up on the<br/>\nlaws yet as we just moved here and also as I don&#39;t have to worry about it<br/>\nfor 3 more years. My son (4) is already reading the Bob books, so I think I<br/>\nwon&#39;t have to worry about that with him, but who knows how my daughter will<br/>\ndo. I just hate the fact that even though we are unschooling, we still have<br/>\nto comform to some sort of timeline about when they have to know certain<br/>\nsubjects. I hate the idea of having to prepare the kids to take tests just<br/>\nso we can keep away from having to deal with government interference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a relatively unrelated note, are there any other unschoolers on this<br/>\nlist from Eugene, OR?? If so, I&#39;d like to hear from you (off-list) about<br/>\nunschooling groups or good homeschooling groups in this area. I tried the<br/>\nnumbers listed in the Oregon Homeschooling handbook, but haven&#39;t gotten a<br/>\nresponse. Went to a homeschooling fair here a few months ago but that ended<br/>\nup being run by a Christian Homeschool organization which is not exactly<br/>\nwhere we&#39;re at.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n  -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) who comments about our garden: &quot;I think a<br/>\nbulldozer would solve this weed problem&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) who loves to dance<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13745,"nextTopicId":13750}}
