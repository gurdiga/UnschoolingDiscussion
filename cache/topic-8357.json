If you use Outlook Express, you&#39;d be well advised to do a search of <br/>\nyour directory, to see whether there are any Kak files in there. (Don&#39;t <br/>\ndelete them until you&#39;ve read up about it, because one is something else. See <br/>\nbelow.)

It replaces<br/>\n&quot;c:&#92;autoexec.bat&quot; with a batch file that deletes the worm<br/>\nfrom the Startup directory. The original &quot;autoexec.bat&quot; is copied to<br/>\n&quot;C:&#92;AE.KAK&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also modifies the message signature settings of Outlook Express<br/>\n5.0 replacing the current signature with an infected file,<br/>\n&quot;C:&#92;Windows&#92;kak.htm&quot;.<br/>\nTherefore every message sent with Outlook Express after that will<br/>\ncontain the worm.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMattie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8353,"nextTopicId":8359}}
