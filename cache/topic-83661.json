The teen years tend to be for exploring relationships.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what their chemistry is saying what they need right now. Just as<br/>\nkids&#39; chemistry often says they need to explore the exciting world around<br/>\nthem. It&#39;s comforting for unschoolers when that happens with younger kids<br/>\nbecause it gives a sense of confidence that unschooled kids are effortlessly<br/>\nsucking in what they&#39;d be learning in school plus much more. But it&#39;s a<br/>\nfalse sense because unschooling works whether it they provide feedback to us<br/>\nor not. (Assuming the environment is right for that child!) A kid exploring<br/>\nthrough video games and pretend play is just as successful an unschooler as<br/>\nkids who mess around with things that provide feedback that they&#39;re<br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their written<br/>\n&gt; usage, punctuation, and spelling aren&#39;t that good.

But they do, and they need scholarships.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re seeing an artificial deadline and worrying because it&#39;s looming. They<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to go to college at 17. They can wait until they&#39;re 19 or 25.<br/>\nThey can take time off to explore the world before they become burdened by<br/>\nresponsibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat will give them time to mature and play with the skills they have in an<br/>\nadult arena. It will give them time to form a better idea of what they enjoy<br/>\nand don&#39;t enjoy in the adult world and what directions they could head in to<br/>\nsupport themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreparing for college doesn&#39;t take 2 1/2 years. It takes as long as someone<br/>\nwants to spend on it once they sent their mind to wanting it. The deadline<br/>\nis what&#39;s scaring you. Forget the deadline. Forget the standard timeline<br/>\nkids follow to get into college.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they see college as a goal, then they will prepare themselves when it<br/>\ncomes time. It may take longer than expected, but ... so what? What will be<br/>\nthe harm if they enter college at 18 rather than 17?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven better than college as a goal, is figuring out what they want to<br/>\nexplore in their lives. College can be a means to an end, but as a goal in<br/>\nitself, it can be a rude surprise at the end when someone has subconsciously<br/>\nexpected college to provide a clear path beyond and it&#39;s either set someone<br/>\non the path of the rat race, or left them at the train station of life with<br/>\nno choice on the destination list that seems exciting and worth pursuing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Digest Number 4149","postDate":"1067827750","msgId":83663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjLjRhMjFkM2ZlLjJjZDcxYzI2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":83661,"nextInTopic":83682,"prevInTime":83662,"nextInTime":83664,"topicId":83661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/2/03 7:40:19 PM, maddengrider@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1775083682\">In a message dated 11/2/03 7:40:19 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maddengrider@...\">maddengrider@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  We&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked about that, and I show them ACT and SAT<br/>\npractice tests. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust have them take a test.
