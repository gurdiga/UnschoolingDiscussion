But I,m always adding new and better reasons, for instance, reading <br/>\neveryone else&#39;s posts I find myself saying over and over- yeah, I agree with <br/>\nthat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have just the one son so far-Gary age 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nGary has been VERY into bugs since before he could walk, and recently he,ms <br/>\ngotten interested in Spanish,and how electricity works(which has stumped me, <br/>\nI have no idea how to explain this to a 6 year old without boring him to <br/>\ntears,I have looked on the web, but most of what I found is a little too <br/>\nadvanced as he doesn&#39;t read much yet.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in Topeka,Kansas, and I,m actually very satisfied with the laws.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe currently have 2 Dachsunds, and 2 cats, although in the past year or so <br/>\nwe&#39;ve also had ,cockateils, Anoles, Red eared sliders and various species of <br/>\nfish, not to mention,dozens of varieties of insects in jars!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are rather eclectic spiritually. We are practising Wiccans, and I also <br/>\nattend a UU felowship, would like to be a member of CUUPS but we have no <br/>\nchapter here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t always have time to post, somedays it&#39;s al I can do to read my <br/>\ne-mail, but I too adore this list, I have learned alot from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can think of.<br/>\n                            Blessings, Trisha<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9066,"nextTopicId":9094}}
