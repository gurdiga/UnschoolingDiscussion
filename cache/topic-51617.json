I often see, whether on lists or &quot;real&quot; life, that while some <br/>\npeople are perfectly comfortable discussing ideas as apart from <br/>\nthemselves, others seem to have a more difficult time of separating <br/>\ntheir self from their ideas, and from there can come misunderstandings <br/>\nand hurt feelings. I like this list *because* it is about ideas, and <br/>\nideas are turned and examined and discussed - as things separate from <br/>\nthe person who shared the idea. To get the most from a group such as <br/>\nthis one, you must be willing to discuss ideas, and entertain the idea <br/>\nthat your way may not be the best way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my two cents, is to say I think this list is great.

And I have let <br/>\nother&#39;s opinions of the list keep me off for a while now (I am so upset about <br/>\nthat).  So many homeschoolers out there think that unschooling is just about <br/>\n&quot;curriculum&quot; choice or lack there of.  I get asked that question all the <br/>\ntime.  &quot; So you don&#39;t use any curriculum?&quot;  But it is so much more than that. <br/>\n And there are so many other lists out there that would be great for people <br/>\nwho interpret unschooling as just about curriculum.  But when you ask <br/>\nquestions or start discussions about allowing children to make choices in <br/>\ntheir lives it seems like I don&#39;t fit in.  The discussion ends up to be about <br/>\ndiscipline and getting a child to do xyz etc. This list has been so valuable <br/>\nto me already in that it has validated my feelings.  For example:  I do not <br/>\nmake my children pick up.  I feel they have a choice and that I have to ask <br/>\nlike I would ask my husband.  Other lists have said that I should not do that <br/>\nand have given lots of advice on getting my boys to help clean up, I end up <br/>\nfeeling like what I think is somehow wrong or damaging to my child, the child <br/>\nshould not have a chance to say no.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think the term unschooling sometimes does a disservice to what I am trying <br/>\nto achieve in my family.

It&#39;s talking about the ideas<br/>\n.... If we see our children&#39;s requests as commands, then our attitude and<br/>\nthe ideas we draw on to respond are going to be different than if we see<br/>\nthem as requests. And it helps to put those requests in the perspective of<br/>\nthe kids. If we ask a 3 yo to wait, it&#39;s like asking an adult to wait 10<br/>\nminutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really neat thing AnneO (from the message board) says she does with her<br/>\nkids is to squeeze their hand 3 times as a family signal &quot;I love you.&quot; It<br/>\nalso says I really wish I could be with you and I will as soon as I can. :-)<br/>\nAnd because she *is* conscious of what she&#39;s asking of them from *their*<br/>\npoint of view they trust her that she *will* be there as quickly as she can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, he would have to wait for me to<br/>\n&gt; be able to do that..( not long, long enough for me to &quot;finish up&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And this is where I might think there might be some value in asking yourself<br/>\nwhy does he *have* to? The reality is that his waiting or not waiting is in<br/>\nyour power. He &quot;has&quot; to wait because you choose to make him wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does it look like from his point of view? What is it you think you&#39;re<br/>\ncommunicating and what are you actually communicating?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think I <br/>\n&gt; have come to understand that THIS list is specifically for &quot;total<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Total unschooling&quot; is what gets discussed. It&#39;s the point of view that all<br/>\nadvice is matched up against. That makes it seem limiting, I know. But what<br/>\nit is is really clear directions to a place we think is really cool. And the<br/>\npeople who want to come and use the directions to get there. And the people<br/>\nwho think some of it sounds okay and some doesn&#39;t can come part way to some<br/>\nplace they find comfortable. They can take what they want and leave the<br/>\nrest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people define unschooling the way I&#39;d define eclectic or relaxed<br/>\nhomeschooling. If the list were relaxed homeschooling more people could<br/>\ncomfortably post but those who wanted to find &quot;total unschooling&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave clear directions and they&#39;d be bumbling around the area. And it would<br/>\nnever be clear if they were &quot;there&quot; yet or not because they&#39;d be surrounded<br/>\nby advice about how they &quot;had to make sure&quot; such and such happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and to go against the grain in any way just causes conflict and<br/>\n&gt; emotional debates.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think, again, this is where hearing a tone that the writer didn&#39;t write<br/>\ncomes in. And reading something into a message that the writer didn&#39;t put<br/>\nthere. From my point of view the debates are logical support of beliefs<br/>\nuntil someone takes a discussion about an idea to imply something personal.<br/>\nAnd then it gets into name calling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m just ME doing what I have to do for myself and my<br/>\n&gt; children to be happy and productive.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I think that&#39;s how most homeschoolers (except the schooling-for-religous<br/>\nreasons ones) would describe themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m think unschoolers would express it as &quot;I want my children to live joyful<br/>\nlives and unschooling is the way to provide that.&quot; (And I could go on about<br/>\nhow unschooling would do that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Landon and I had a nice conversation today about &quot;extremists&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt; dont know what else to call folks who adhere strongly to thier<br/>\n&gt; beliefs and dont accept any ones elses on any particular matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sure, I have my own set<br/>\n&gt; of beliefs and practices for every aspect of my life.  I feel my<br/>\n&gt; choices are right for me and my family.  I may even think they are<br/>\n&gt; better than some other&#39;s choices.  But, I dont try to &quot;convert&quot;<br/>\n&gt; others to my way of thinking.. Nor do I think folks with different<br/>\n&gt; views are inferior to me in any way at all.  I can disagree with<br/>\n&gt; someone and still respect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I accept that other people have different goals than I do. I accept that in<br/>\norder to meet those goals they have different needs. Diversity is a great<br/>\nthing in life. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when you want to talk about one thing diversity makes it impossible.<br/>\nIt&#39;s like someone handing you an unalphabetized encyclopedia without an<br/>\nindex or table of contents when all you want is to find out about Thomas<br/>\nEdison.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because the Episcopalians want to discuss Christianity every Sunday<br/>\ndoes that mean they don&#39;t embrace diversity? Does that mean they think<br/>\nthey&#39;re better than the Buddhists or the Hindus? (And if you happen to have<br/>\nrigid my-way-or-the-highway Episcopalians around where you live, then insert<br/>\nany liberal Christian denomination ;-) And because they adamantly sure of<br/>\ntheir beliefs, does that mean they want you to believe the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one&#39;s saying unschooling is the only way to homeschool. (The forum is<br/>\nclearly called Unschooling.com not Homeschooling.com No one&#39;s trying to<br/>\ndisguise the fact that this is a special subset of homeschooling.) No one is<br/>\nsaying you need to stop believing what you believe and believe what&#39;s<br/>\nexpressed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut does a list about Italian cooking need to include tacos to demonstrate<br/>\nthat they accept diversity as is a good thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe it is a protective instinct,<br/>\n&gt; when you do something differently that the majority, to be quick to<br/>\n&gt; judge and condemn others if they dont agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And no one here cares if you don&#39;t :-) Really! We&#39;re protective of the<br/>\n*idea* of unschooling. No one needs to *do* what anyone here says but the<br/>\ndiscussion needs to stick to the idea of unschooling or the list ceases to<br/>\nbe an unschooling discussion list and becomes something else. It becomes a<br/>\nplace for people who like the idea of unschooling to talk about life. That&#39;s<br/>\nnot a bad thing! It&#39;s just different from what this list is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why there are 1000 members for all the complaining about how<br/>\nmean this list is! ;-) but there&#39;s something this list offers that seems to<br/>\nbe what many people are looking for. There are a lot of unschooling lists<br/>\nout there that are &quot;nicer&quot; than we are -- and I dont think it&#39;s the meaness<br/>\nthat makes people stick around! -- so I&#39;ve gotta go with the type of<br/>\nunschooling discussion we have. (Or maybe there&#39;s something wrong with Yahoo<br/>\nand people can&#39;t sign off once they sign on ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, I dont think my own contributions are<br/>\n&gt; appreciated or even wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again it&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s about ideas. Buddhists are  welcome at the<br/>\nEpiscopal church and I&#39;m sure plenty of Episcopalians would be interested to<br/>\nhear what they have to say outside the church, but Episcopalians come to the<br/>\nchurch because they *want* to hear about Christianity. If they let anyone<br/>\nspeak it wouldn&#39;t be an Episcopal church. It would be a Unitarian :-) And<br/>\nbeing Unitarian myself, I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing! But it&#39;s certainly<br/>\ndifferent from an Episcopal church and I don&#39;t begrudge the Episcopalians<br/>\nfor sticking to their own brand of Christianity on Sundays or think they&#39;re<br/>\nbeing exlusionary or uppity.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Several folks here have suggested that I find<br/>\n&gt; or create a group for folks that share my views and opinions.. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] My $2.00 worth..","postDate":"1040003660","msgId":51695,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNERkQzMjRELkRDMDQ0NDNCQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PEJBMjI4NzEwLjEwQTc3JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":51690,"nextInTopic":51699,"prevInTime":51694,"nextInTime":51696,"topicId":51617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**When someone says something and another person makes a direct response to it, then it is aimed at you.** Actually, *no*, that is *not* the way a discussion","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-194467828\">**When someone says something and another person makes a direct response<br/>\nto it, then it is aimed at you.**<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, *no*, that is *not* the way a discussion list works.

I think it is a lot easier when we use real life scenarios to <br/>\nillustrate our points.     I think a lot of what I try to convey gets <br/>\nmisconstrued.  Even the &quot;talking to Judy&quot; scenario.   I said that I would <br/>\nhave either called her back or asked her to come to see the trick too.. but.. <br/>\nI still wouldnt just drop and run at his command.    I would acknowledge his <br/>\nexcitement, I would go see his trick.. But, he would have to wait for me to <br/>\nbe able to do that..( not long, long enough for me to &quot;finish up&quot;)  I think I <br/>\nhave come to understand that THIS list is specifically for &quot;total <br/>\nunschoolers&quot; and to go against the grain in any way just causes conflict and <br/>\nemotional debates.     I posted the following  to my local homeschool support <br/>\ngroup, so its got some &quot;they and them&quot; references in it.  We have been <br/>\ndiscussing the different types of homeschoolers, unschoolers, etc..  The <br/>\ngroup is a lot more diverse and accepting of others practices and beliefs.  <br/>\nAnd, that is not a judgement on THIS list, just an observance.  As a matter <br/>\nof fact, several folks on this list have pointed out that list is for talking <br/>\nabout unschooling, not other methods of  parenting and/or teaching.   Anyway, <br/>\nheres what I said.. its just basically sums up my perspective on the whole <br/>\ndebate. <br/>\n********  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree about the &quot;labeling&quot;, I dont really care for it.. but <br/>\nsometimes its necessary to define our ideals quickly.  I suppose <br/>\nsince I am not in total agreement with the parenting lifestyle of <br/>\nradical unschoolers, that I am more of a relaxed homeschooler.  <br/>\nReally, Im just what I said in a much much earlier post ( right after <br/>\nI joined)  I&#39;m just ME doing what I have to do for myself and my <br/>\nchildren to be happy and productive.  Its kind of funny that I am <br/>\nbeing considered &quot;traditional&quot; on the other group... LOL.. Most folks <br/>\nwho know me think I am WAYY too radical and lenient with my <br/>\nparenting.  I think a lot of the very conservative and &quot;old school&quot; <br/>\nparenting practices are very prevalent in this area because we live <br/>\nin the Bible Belt.  NC (and dont get me wrong, I LOVE NC) is <br/>\ngenerally a little &quot;behind the times&quot; and slow to accept change.  <br/>\nMost folks say.. OMG, I cant believe what you let your kids get by <br/>\nwith!.. I wouldnt stand for that!... And here I am, now being accused <br/>\nof being &quot;traditional&quot;   And, traditional does not automatically mean <br/>\nbad or wrong.  A lot of us came up with traditional parenting, and we <br/>\nare doing just fine.. Hey, even better than just fine, doing GREAT, <br/>\nand not resenting our parents for raising us the old fashioned way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Landon and I had a nice conversation today about &quot;extremists&quot;  I <br/>\ndont know what else to call folks who adhere strongly to thier <br/>\nbeliefs and dont accept any ones elses on any particular matter.   <br/>\nThis kind of people exist in every facet imaginable.  Religious (ANY <br/>\nreligion) people who think they are the only ones going to heaven and <br/>\nif you dont agree and practice thier beliefs 100%, you are doomed.  <br/>\nFolks who have political views that they think are the ONLY right <br/>\nchoice.  Parenting styles, education styles, sexual orientation, <br/>\nheck, even hobbies like cooking, gardening, sewing. You have to do it <br/>\nTHEIR way, or you are wrong and &quot;bad&quot;.  I have realized and come to <br/>\nappreciate my own acceptance of diversity.. Sure, I have my own set <br/>\nof beliefs and practices for every aspect of my life.  I feel my <br/>\nchoices are right for me and my family.  I may even think they are <br/>\nbetter than some other&#39;s choices.  But, I dont try to &quot;convert&quot; <br/>\nothers to my way of thinking.. Nor do I think folks with different <br/>\nviews are inferior to me in any way at all.  I can disagree with <br/>\nsomeone and still respect them.   Maybe it is a protective instinct, <br/>\nwhen you do something differently that the majority, to be quick to <br/>\njudge and condemn others if they dont agree with you.  The thing is, <br/>\nI dont really care if they want to make eggs at 3am, or leave all <br/>\nthier toys and clothes on the floor, or end adult conversations for their <br/>\nchildren.  REALLY, I dont care  (as long as  no one is getting hurt, <br/>\nphysically or emotionally).. I mean, it doesnt affect me or my <br/>\nchildren..  I am sure these people love thier children and they feel they are <br/>\ndoing the right thing, and thats fine with me.  What I dont understand is why <br/>\nthey can&#39;t see my situation in the same light.   <br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like to stay on this list. I have met some very intelligent, <br/>\nfriendly, and helpful folks.    But, I dont think my own contributions are <br/>\nappreciated or even wanted.    Several folks here have suggested that I find <br/>\nor create a group for folks that share my views and opinions.. Well, life is <br/>\nnot segregated like that.  We all have to live together, and I think we <br/>\nshould all get along.   But, thats just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] My $2.00 worth..","postDate":"1039979163","msgId":51636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNERkNEMjlDLkVDNzNBMzQyQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDExYi4xYjU5NWRjZC4yYjJlMWQ1NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51617,"nextInTopic":51670,"prevInTime":51635,"nextInTime":51637,"topicId":51617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1572289147\">**<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Why do the unschooling police  want to act like a group of Queen <br/>\nBees. that wont allow anyone &quot;in&quot; unless that are clones of them??  <br/>\nThere have even been subtle advice to &quot;just leave if you dont like <br/>\nit&quot;  Well, I am NOT leaving.

(He and his <br/>\nwife gave Kirby a ride.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m more worried about the actions of the 36 year old (I do have a social <br/>\ninvestment) and what he might do and say than I am about Kirby.   My concern <br/>\nabout Kirby is that I hope he&#39;s charming enough that the family hosting him <br/>\nis glad he came to their house. I hope he thanks them sufficiently and didn&#39;t <br/>\nmake a mess.  I have NO concerns about him being &quot;in trouble.&quot;  The older <br/>\nfriend, though, should not drink and still does, and he&#39;ll be at a medieval <br/>\nChristmas feast and his chances of commiting a socio-political faux-pas are <br/>\ngreater than Kirby&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Even with an <br/>\nadult along( they didnt follow us around everywhere), we managed to <br/>\nget drunk a couple of times, hook up with strange guys, and get lost <br/>\ndowntown. I would have gotten in WAY more trouble, maybe even dead, <br/>\nif there was not an adult along. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMidnight is arbitrary, though.  11:45 is as dangerous as 12:15, espeically if <br/>\nkids will drink and hook up with strange guys.  That&#39;s dangerous at 2:00 in <br/>\nthe afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;Distruptive and defensive&quot; seems to be defined and not agreeing 100% <br/>\nwith what some others practice..  Also, defending our own practices <br/>\nwhen we are judged harshly for them.  There IS a double standard <br/>\nhere.. Its so easy to see when reading through the posts.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat there is is holding each story (mine or anyone&#39;s--I was lately <br/>\ncriticized, if not here then at the forum, for having told Kirby if he didn&#39;t <br/>\nlike it here pick another family he knew and we&#39;d pay them to keep him, and <br/>\nstill give him his allowance) up to the light of what&#39;s good for kids, and <br/>\nwhat works with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe double standard has nothing to do with individuals, it has to to with <br/>\nphilosophy.  So if someone comes determined to defend traditional parenting <br/>\nand to scoff at attachment parenting, continuum concept, unschooling, and <br/>\nthat group of principles (different people pick and choose from different <br/>\nparts of that), the defenses will be challenged.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I start making Holly do math books, people here are going to remind me <br/>\nwhat kind of damage that can do to her love of math.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am curious as to why no one replied to my response.   I have <br/>\nreplied to many posts and they are basically ignored or only a minute <br/>\npart of them responded to.. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they thought your feelings were too hurt already.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;nother form or &quot;cliqueness&quot;..  I <br/>\nwas thinking, this list is a lot like High School.. or heck, even <br/>\nmiddle school. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really think so?  <br/>\nThe less you see the world in terms of school, the sooner you&#39;ll be <br/>\ncomfortable with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Why do the unschooling police  want to act like a group of Queen <br/>\nBees. that wont allow anyone &quot;in&quot; unless that are clones of them??  <br/>\nThere have even been subtle advice to &quot;just leave if you dont like <br/>\nit&quot;  Well, I am NOT leaving.  I wont be bullied by others into <br/>\nagreeing with every aspect of thier lifestyle.  I wont try to change <br/>\nthem, and again, I must reiterate.. I HAVE NOT JUDGED... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe statement above is nasty and judgmental, and to say we&#39;re like midschool <br/>\nis judgmental.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I think my <br/>\nparenting methods are just as valid and worthy as the next persons.  <br/>\nI know I can gain knowledge and learn from others.
