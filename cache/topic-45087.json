How<br/>\n  &gt;   awful that must have felt!  Having been a LLL leader, it saddens me to <br/>\n  &gt; hear<br/>\n  &gt;   that you did not feel any support at the meeting you attended, a meeting<br/>\n  &gt;   where the primary purpose is to offer support and encouragement to ALL <br/>\n  &gt; moms<br/>\n  &gt;   who wish to breastfeed their babies.  I can certainly understand why you<br/>\n  &gt;   would have been brought to near tears after feeling attacked.  I think I<br/>\n  &gt;   would have felt that way, too!  No mom should have to defend her <br/>\n  &gt; choices to<br/>\n  &gt;   ANYONE, certainly not people she is going to for HELP!<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   But, I do want to say that LLL&#39;s policy is offer support through<br/>\n  &gt;   encouragement, not attacking moms choices!  I pray and I believe that your<br/>\n  &gt;   experience is not the typical experience a mom would have who had formerly<br/>\n  &gt;   bottle-fed and wanted now to breastfeed.  We certainly had moms attend our<br/>\n  &gt;   meetings who had bottle-fed in the past, but LLL accepts all moms and<br/>\n  &gt;   accepts people where they ARE now (or at least this is the ideal).  Each<br/>\n  &gt;   group is made up of the people who attend, and each leader is a volunteer<br/>\n  &gt;   mom.  Therefore, no two meetings and no two groups are exactly the same,<br/>\n  &gt;   but I do know that LLL does not encourage its members or leaders to<br/>\n  &gt;   criticize others&#39; choices in any way.  My co-leader said it well.  She<br/>\n  &gt;   asked moms who came to our meetings to think of the meetings as a<br/>\n  &gt;   supermarket of ideas. Each mom knows her family and her situation best and<br/>\n  &gt;   should only take the ideas that SHE feels would work in her situation, and<br/>\n  &gt;   leave the rest, just as we don&#39;t buy everything in a supermarket.  The<br/>\n  &gt;   point is that LLL acknowledges that each mom is THE expert on her family.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   It breaks my heart to think that you came away from La Leche League with<br/>\n  &gt;   such a bad (but understandable) impression of the organization.  Many<br/>\n  &gt;   people have come to our meetings warily because they had heard that LLL <br/>\n  &gt; was<br/>\n  &gt;   nothing but a bunch of breastfeeding maniacs, and they were pleasantly<br/>\n  &gt;   surprised and went on to become members and held group jobs and one person<br/>\n  &gt;   I can think of became a leader applicant.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Warmly,<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   Marji<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;   P.S.  By the way, we have had moms who come to our LLL meetings or call me<br/>\n  &gt;   on the phone because they want to wean from the breast and start<br/>\n  &gt;   bottles.  And, if this is the kind of support they need, this is the kind<br/>\n  &gt;   of support a LLL leader would give.  Having said that, sometimes a mom <br/>\n  &gt; will<br/>\n  &gt;   ask for that kind of information but on further questioning from the LLL<br/>\n  &gt;   leader, there is, in fact, a different issue that needs to be resolved and<br/>\n  &gt;   then the breastfeeding relationship can continue, IF that&#39;s what the mom<br/>\n  &gt;   REALLY wants.

As it ended up, my midwife was the only one to help me any, and that was just once right after the birth, and again twice on the telephone. Thankfully, I had no problems or I don&#39;t know if I would have been able to work them out. My only problem now is my little princess has gotten teeth and is not afraid to use them! LOL <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep what you said about LLL&#39;s policies and such, I must just have found a lousy bunch. :-(<br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  (((((((Myranda)))))))<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m SO sorry that you had that kind of an experience at a LLL meeting!  How <br/>\n  awful that must have felt!  Having been a LLL leader, it saddens me to hear <br/>\n  that you did not feel any support at the meeting you attended, a meeting <br/>\n  where the primary purpose is to offer support and encouragement to ALL moms <br/>\n  who wish to breastfeed their babies.  I can certainly understand why you <br/>\n  would have been brought to near tears after feeling attacked.  I think I <br/>\n  would have felt that way, too!  No mom should have to defend her choices to <br/>\n  ANYONE, certainly not people she is going to for HELP!<br/>\n<br/>\n  But, I do want to say that LLL&#39;s policy is offer support through <br/>\n  encouragement, not attacking moms choices!  I pray and I believe that your <br/>\n  experience is not the typical experience a mom would have who had formerly <br/>\n  bottle-fed and wanted now to breastfeed.  We certainly had moms attend our <br/>\n  meetings who had bottle-fed in the past, but LLL accepts all moms and <br/>\n  accepts people where they ARE now (or at least this is the ideal).  Each <br/>\n  group is made up of the people who attend, and each leader is a volunteer <br/>\n  mom.  Therefore, no two meetings and no two groups are exactly the same, <br/>\n  but I do know that LLL does not encourage its members or leaders to <br/>\n  criticize others&#39; choices in any way.  My co-leader said it well.  She <br/>\n  asked moms who came to our meetings to think of the meetings as a <br/>\n  supermarket of ideas. Each mom knows her family and her situation best and <br/>\n  should only take the ideas that SHE feels would work in her situation, and <br/>\n  leave the rest, just as we don&#39;t buy everything in a supermarket.  The <br/>\n  point is that LLL acknowledges that each mom is THE expert on her family.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It breaks my heart to think that you came away from La Leche League with <br/>\n  such a bad (but understandable) impression of the organization.  Many <br/>\n  people have come to our meetings warily because they had heard that LLL was <br/>\n  nothing but a bunch of breastfeeding maniacs, and they were pleasantly <br/>\n  surprised and went on to become members and held group jobs and one person <br/>\n  I can think of became a leader applicant.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warmly,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  P.S.  By the way, we have had moms who come to our LLL meetings or call me <br/>\n  on the phone because they want to wean from the breast and start <br/>\n  bottles.  And, if this is the kind of support they need, this is the kind <br/>\n  of support a LLL leader would give.  Having said that, sometimes a mom will <br/>\n  ask for that kind of information but on further questioning from the LLL <br/>\n  leader, there is, in fact, a different issue that needs to be resolved and <br/>\n  then the breastfeeding relationship can continue, IF that&#39;s what the mom <br/>\n  REALLY wants.  We have to be careful to find out what the mom really wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 15:31 10/3/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings!

We certainly had moms attend our <br/>\nmeetings who had bottle-fed in the past, but LLL accepts all moms and <br/>\naccepts people where they ARE now (or at least this is the ideal).  Each <br/>\ngroup is made up of the people who attend, and each leader is a volunteer <br/>\nmom.  Therefore, no two meetings and no two groups are exactly the same, <br/>\nbut I do know that LLL does not encourage its members or leaders to <br/>\ncriticize others&#39; choices in any way.  My co-leader said it well.  She <br/>\nasked moms who came to our meetings to think of the meetings as a <br/>\nsupermarket of ideas. Each mom knows her family and her situation best and <br/>\nshould only take the ideas that SHE feels would work in her situation, and <br/>\nleave the rest, just as we don&#39;t buy everything in a supermarket.  The <br/>\npoint is that LLL acknowledges that each mom is THE expert on her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt breaks my heart to think that you came away from La Leche League with <br/>\nsuch a bad (but understandable) impression of the organization.  Many <br/>\npeople have come to our meetings warily because they had heard that LLL was <br/>\nnothing but a bunch of breastfeeding maniacs, and they were pleasantly <br/>\nsurprised and went on to become members and held group jobs and one person <br/>\nI can think of became a leader applicant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  By the way, we have had moms who come to our LLL meetings or call me <br/>\non the phone because they want to wean from the breast and start <br/>\nbottles.  And, if this is the kind of support they need, this is the kind <br/>\nof support a LLL leader would give.  Having said that, sometimes a mom will <br/>\nask for that kind of information but on further questioning from the LLL <br/>\nleader, there is, in fact, a different issue that needs to be resolved and <br/>\nthen the breastfeeding relationship can continue, IF that&#39;s what the mom <br/>\nREALLY wants.  We have to be careful to find out what the mom really wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15:31 10/3/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings!
