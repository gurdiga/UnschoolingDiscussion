He knew everyone<br/>\non the ballot.  He knew about every initiative and proposition.  We made<br/>\nhim an official looking voter&#39;s registration card and he got to fill out<br/>\na ballot.   (He voted for Ralph Nader by the way &lt;g&gt; he really is a<br/>\nradical!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a group of men behind us in the line, grown up guys at least in<br/>\ntheir thirties or forties, and they were looking at the ballot saying<br/>\n&quot;Who are all these guys?&quot;  &quot;What&#39;s the Natural Law party?&quot;, etc. <br/>\nThere were seven political parties on the ballot in Montana that year. <br/>\nIt was a record, a big deal! <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan was shocked.  He was eight years old and he was shocked that voting<br/>\nadults didn&#39;t know anything about what they were voting for.  He stood<br/>\nthere, maybe ten minutes, explaining to these men about the parties,<br/>\ncandidates, etc...  Their votes counted and his didn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there ya go.  My son says kids should be able to vote.   He actually<br/>\ncalled and wrote to our friends in an informal survey about eliminating<br/>\nthe voting age.   Most said  kids could be too easily tricked, too easily<br/>\npressured, etc.   The older people he knows, 70 years plus were all for<br/>\nkids voting.  Mostly they remembered reading about all the reason men had<br/>\ncome up with in opposition to women voting.  Too easily tricked,  too<br/>\neasily pressured, ...&lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan has had many interesting conversations with adults about children&#39;s<br/>\nrights.  He and his uncle are trying to design automobiles children could<br/>\ndrive, for that day when they lower the driving age to ten. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLook out world.  Not only will parents be quaking at not being able to<br/>\nspank their kids, but WHOA, what are you gonna do when little VOTERS are<br/>\nDRIVING?   Makes satanic T-shirts and eyebrow piercing&#39;s seem kind of<br/>\nmild.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48367,"nextTopicId":48434}}
