Do you talk with your sons about <br/>\nthis when things are calm? Trying to talk when tempers are flared is <br/>\nnot going to work. Talk about better ways to handle frustration and <br/>\nanger.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso...maybe they need to get out more. Go bike riding or hiking or <br/>\nroller blading. My kids had a lot of anger issues when we adopted <br/>\nthem and physical activity has really helped us. We have bikes, <br/>\nroller blades, a playset, skateboards, a pogo stick, jump ropes and <br/>\nwe just bought a 14&#39; trampoline for them for Christmas (I can&#39;t wait <br/>\nto give it to them!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helps!<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.foreverparents.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;momspeapods&quot; <br/>\n&lt;jagreensboro@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Does anyone have any advice on sibling fighting?
