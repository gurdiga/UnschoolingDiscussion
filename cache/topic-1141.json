It will never<br/>\nhappen. I am learning to unschool 5 kids ages 2-7. It is still a new<br/>\nconcept to me and I was very excited about the idea of learning from<br/>\nmore experienced unschoolers.  Most of what I read on here is valuable<br/>\nbut I just can&#39;t keep up, I have been reading for over an hour this<br/>\nmorning (and did the same yesterday) and I am still not caught up from<br/>\nthe weekend. The kids will be up soon.  Before I unsub from this great<br/>\nbut very overwhelmingly large list I would like to see if there are<br/>\nfolks who are similarly minded and situated who may be interested in a<br/>\nsmaller, more intimate, manageable list. Specifically: Christian,<br/>\nunschooler, attachment parenting(ish), into health and natural<br/>\nalternatives to the chemical filled world, not into the materialistic<br/>\ncommercialism that surrounds us. If this sounds somewhat like you, e<br/>\nmail me . <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Starfreedom@...\">Starfreedom@...</a>  I am sorry to leave this list but I<br/>\nneed to get more specific with the small amount of time I have.
