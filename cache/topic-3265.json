I ordered it three weeks ago<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n&gt; Holt and Assoc. ONe for me and, on faith, one for my very<br/>\n&gt; antihomeschooling mother-in-law. From the annotation in the HOlt<br/>\n&gt; catelogue<br/>\n&gt; it sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy<br/>\n&gt; reading<br/>\n&gt; and find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired<br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; arguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to<br/>\n&gt; read<br/>\n&gt; something about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we<br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; ruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only<br/>\n&gt; way.<br/>\n&gt; So, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; ever read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; send her some of Holt&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve loved everything you&#39;ve said so far in this chat group and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; looking forward to your book.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ann &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Dear Ann --<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your kind words.
