Same with Geo. Washington. He didn&#39;t go to school until age 11, <br/>\nand at that, he knew how to read and do his math. At age 11, he <br/>\nentereed a course of trigonometry, and became the county surveyor at <br/>\nage 17. His passion was horse riding, and he was athletic more than <br/>\nbookish...which perfectly fit him for the position he was to take in <br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese guys lived their lives, learned how to do things from their <br/>\nparents and other adults in the community, and taught themselves <br/>\nwhatever else caught their fancy. They weren&#39;t under the tutelage of <br/>\nclassics teachers. But I bet there were many amongst them who could <br/>\nread Latin and Greek. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey followed what they thought was interesting, and history calls <br/>\nthem great...because they were. The internal drive makes greatness. <br/>\nSome people have that leadership in them. Some people are going to be <br/>\ncontent earning their living, loving their kids, having some <br/>\nenjoyable hobbies and interests without the push and the drive.

The Autobio, that is. And <br/>\nlearned something that amazed me, though I did know it: Benjamin <br/>\nFranklin wasn&#39;t brought up a printer. His father was a chandler who <br/>\nscraped by, but filled his dinner table with conversation from <br/>\ninteresting people, and that is what Ben. Franklin grew up on: <br/>\nworking hard to help his dad with the candle shop, listening to <br/>\ndiverse, high quality adult conversation regularly, and he also <br/>\nmentions being an early reader. But not so good at math. He taught <br/>\nhimself algebra at age 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay. Though Franklin advocated a system for educating all of <br/>\nsociety, if he&#39;d taken a look around him, he would have seen <br/>\n(according to Gatto&#39;s stats in his Big Book) a 94% literacy rate <br/>\namongst adults, and even among African slaves, an 80% literacy rate. <br/>\nThey were getting their education from parents who wanted their <br/>\nchildren to be readers. In fact, wasn&#39;t it expected of parents, that <br/>\nthey would teach reading and math, along with the Family Trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who displayed an ability in academics, went on to be scholars. <br/>\nIn fact, Franklin himself went to a clerical school for a year, but <br/>\nthe family couldn&#39;t afford it. The point I am drawing from this <br/>\nis: &quot;those who displayed an ability in academics&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nIOW, not every single person in society got a formal education. Ben <br/>\nFranklin&#39;s father recognized a scholarliness about the boy, and <br/>\nwanted him to get some of that formal education. Didn&#39;t work out, and <br/>\nhe ended up starting a print shop, eh? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...diversity in society. Americans owned businesses, and children <br/>\nlearned the business from their parents, or were apprenticed to <br/>\nbusinesses/trades. Because parents knew their responsibilities, <br/>\nchildren learned to read and write, and do math...and learned the <br/>\nthings their parents did. A child with a bent towards learning <br/>\nvisually, might be spotted as a potential scholar, but not every <br/>\nchild was expected to be scholarly. Bookish.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think America had more doers then, than now? And that the <br/>\npublic school system has created a homogeneity that is unhealthy and <br/>\ninhuman? And that homeschoolers who are willing to let their children <br/>\nrun on the road of their own choosing, are coming BACK to something <br/>\nthat we once had in abundance, and pushed away with generations of <br/>\nour &quot;scientific method&quot; of educating?<br/>\n<br/>\nwell, some thoughts, anyway<br/>\nHeidiC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68236,"nextTopicId":68237}}
