I<br/>\nsaid my cats stay in but I neglected to mention that I<br/>\nlive on Lake Superior, where we still have several<br/>\nfeet of snow on the ground and more to come. It snows<br/>\npredictably from October through mid-May, and I&#39;ve<br/>\nseen it snow at least once every month of the year. My<br/>\ncats don&#39;t WANT to go outside. A couple times they&#39;ve<br/>\ngone out the door, stopped, made WHOA!
