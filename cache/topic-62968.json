I always did well in school. But I remember grade school being tough as I was shy and quiet and just didn&#39;t fit in mostly. 6-8 grade I went to a private catholic academy. The first year I was one of 4 girls and 21 boys in the class. Real nice for puberty. (not) Once more girls came in the following years, I seemed to be left out again. High school, which was also private seemed pretty much the same way. Just didn&#39;t fit in to all that catty gossipy I need a boyfriend girl stuff. So I finally stopped trying to join and became the strange one. Did yoga in my homeroom every morning while everyone else was screaming around like nuts. School was always easy without me putting forth much effort. The teachers were just as drawn into the whole popularity thing as the kids were. Thought they were stupid too and I pretty much rebelled from doing anything I didn&#39;t have to do. I was the only person in the Natiuonal Honor Society that didn&#39;t have to do a speech and ask to be a member. Didn&#39;t think it was worth my time but they put me in anyway because of my grades. Graduated top ten and thought it was no big deal. Could have done better if I wanted to. But it was just wonderful for everyone else and that was fine with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI desperately wanted to go to school to be a vet. My dad was on the athletic association of a college back home and he talked to some professors who talked to me and pretty much squelched my dreams. Seems at that time it was pretty much all politics as to who got in to vet school, regardless of grades. Blew my bubble. I moved to FL and went to a paramedical school and got a degree in medical/veterinary assisting. Partied hard and still made the grades. The jobs sucked and I ended up slinging drinks instead. Never went back to the medical field until years and years later. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I was setting myself up all along for not seeing school as important. I remember years ago hearing about some strange family living in the mountains who&#39;s kids didn&#39;t go to school. Thought it was neat but at that time I also thought it was illegal. (it was the Colfaxes) Remembered that years later when I read one of their books. <br/>\n<br/>\nDidn&#39;t have much of a say so about Tara&#39;s upbringing. She went to a &quot;good&quot; catholic private school. She was shy and although smart, had a rough time. Didn&#39;t know I had other options. Read about homeschooling in our local paper around the time Joseph was born. Joe and I had been to Tara&#39;s school so much by now because of how the teachers behaved, I knew this was something I really wanted to do. Joe was in total agreement. With a child in a &quot;good&quot; school, how could we not see the harm? We saw it everyday. We signed up in a local homeschooling support group when Joseph was 2 and Sierra was 1. One of the first women I met from my area was an unschooler. In all sense of the word. Joe and I never thought twice. We just knew this was it. We&#39;ve never had any doubts since then that this is the right way to go and that it won&#39;t work. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wonder if my schooling experience was better if I would have felt the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] What IS it?","postDate":"1049565317","msgId":63020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Yy4xODVmYmU3Zi4yYmMwNzI4NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63009,"nextInTopic":63022,"prevInTime":63019,"nextInTime":63021,"topicId":62968,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/5/03 9:38:45 AM, leschke@shaw.ca writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-601527685\">In a message dated 4/5/03 9:38:45 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; finally back to the principal, who<br/>\n<br/>\nsaid he could get me out on a &quot;mentally unfit for the classroom&quot; excuse. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW COOL!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just left early and went to college early.
