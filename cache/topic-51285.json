I can see all sides of the story.  My<br/>\ndh is totally paranoid about Thanksgiving traffic.  More than about any<br/>\nother traffic throughout the year.  And he pressures me unmercifully to<br/>\nget me up and out the door early, early, early.  (Sometimes I think he<br/>\noverdoes it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can also remember, as a teen, my mother labling me &quot;manipulative&quot;<br/>\n(that hurt!) for using all the methods that your son did to try to get<br/>\nwhat I wanted.  I can&#39;t remember the details of my case, except that it<br/>\nwas a logistical problem involving my mom, my brother and I, with only<br/>\none car, wanting to go all kinds of far apart different places over the<br/>\ncourse of the weekend.  I kept proposing scenarios and my mom kept<br/>\nshooting them down.  She thinks I was trying to make her feel guilty<br/>\n(apparently because she DID), but I wasn&#39;t trying to do that, I was just<br/>\ntrying to get what I wanted.

And, *sometimes*, I&#39;m guilty of doing that with MY son, I&#39;ll<br/>\ncalculate a complicated logistical scenario in my mind and reduce it to<br/>\n&quot;Nope, we don&#39;t have time today.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can think of in your scenario is (1) gee, I wish the group going<br/>\nshopping could have announced the date earlier and (2) maybe some<br/>\nalternative transportation to get your son to the camping site a day<br/>\nlater was possible.  (But, I&#39;m guessing that you already considered<br/>\nthat.

And our children having a say in what goes on in our <br/>\nfamily.  A very recent incident keeps coming to my mind...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Our family had planned for over a month on going camping over the <br/>\nThanksgiving holiday.  The week before Thanksgiving, our oldest son, Landon, <br/>\nfound out that his drama club was going shopping for a needy family on the <br/>\nday that we were leaving.  He REALLY enjoys this outing( theyve been doing it <br/>\nfor 3 years), and I think there was a certain girl involved that he REALLY <br/>\nwanted to see.  Anyway, he asked if we could delay our departure until after <br/>\nthe shopping trip.  There was no way.   The trip was a 6 hour drive, and our <br/>\ngetting a campsite was contingent on first come first serve, and we couldn&#39;t <br/>\nrisk getting there late.   If he had went shopping, we couldn&#39;t have left til <br/>\nafter 2:00 at the earliest.. which was too late to insure getting a campsite <br/>\n( plus we would have gotten there after dark, had to set up camp in the dark, <br/>\netc etc)  I told him he could stay at home or with his Grandparents.  The <br/>\nchoice was his to make.. Stay or go.  The problem was, he wanted to do both. <br/>\n. He wanted to go shopping, but he didnt want to miss the whole camping trip. <br/>\n We had to take a majority vote.. Everyone else wanted to leave on  <br/>\nWednesday, so he got voted out... OH BOY was he mad.. no, mad is not the <br/>\nword, he was livid.  It really broke my heart for him, because I do remember <br/>\nbeing 16 and the high emotion of &quot;things&quot;  I know he felt like he was missing <br/>\nthe biggest event in the world.     He pushed and begged and cussed and <br/>\npleaded and tried every guilt inducing trick in the world.  ( same stunts I <br/>\npulled on my parents..lol)  But we had to stand firm..  He had to sacrifice <br/>\nhis needs and wants for the rest of the family.   Now, maybe some think my <br/>\nson is selfish and does not follow principles.  I say, heck, he&#39;s 16 and that <br/>\nhow kids act.  On the whole, he is a VERY good kid, mature, responsible, and <br/>\nconsiderate.  He was just frustrated over the conflict of scheduling and he <br/>\nfelt &quot;screwed over&quot; because he didnt get to go with his friends.  He went <br/>\ncamping with us and after a day of pouting and ignoring us( we left him alone <br/>\nto sulk), he came around and he had a really good time.  Deep down he <br/>\nunderstood why we couldnt delay our trip just for him, but he felt like he <br/>\nhad to make every effort to get his way. <br/>\n<br/>\n The purpose of me telling this long story?  Well, its just a practical <br/>\nexample of how sometimes ( in MY family) we do have to set limits and enforce <br/>\nrestrictions.
