The only <br/>\nmore formal thing we are now starting is a 4-H club, for those that <br/>\nare interested. That will mean an actual meeting 2x per month.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to read more about us, or see pictures, you can visit <br/>\npensacolaunschoolers.com.  We have planned some of our get <br/>\ntogethers, because someone had a cool idea or game to share, and we <br/>\nlike to do parties for the holidays and such, but it&#39;s very relaxed, <br/>\nvery much about building friendships and NOT doing a bunch of <br/>\nplanning. Most of the planning falls on me because I LIKE that kind <br/>\nof thing.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of us met down at the Earth Day festivities on Saturday, and <br/>\nwe&#39;re doing a tour of the EPA facility on Sabine Island. So we do <br/>\nplan stuff here and there, but it evolves in it&#39;s own way and only <br/>\nwhen someone wishes to organize such events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say, take it easy, just invite folks to hang out with you. Ideas <br/>\nwill come up, the group will take on a life of it&#39;s own. Unschoolers <br/>\ndon&#39;t need some &quot;facilitator&quot; to make a group successful. Part of <br/>\nbeing a successful unschooler is recognizing your own power and <br/>\nability!  She may be a hugely successful unschooler, and she may <br/>\nhave had a fabulous group, but she didn&#39;t PAY someone to help her do <br/>\nit, she just figured it out!

We polled families within the <br/>\ngroup and found out what kind subjects they would like to see discussed.  <br/>\nHere are some examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nDual enrollment-We had a dual enrollment representative from the local <br/>\ncollege and a parent who at the time had her second child attending the college <br/>\nunder dual enrollment. <br/>\n<br/>\nLibrary help-had a rep from the local library and a parent who uses the <br/>\nlibrary frequently. <br/>\n<br/>\nFavorite curriculum-We had parents bring some of their favorite curriculum to <br/>\nshow and talk about what they liked best about it. Including websites. <br/>\n<br/>\nPortfolios- Have a rep from the local county homeschool office or a favorite <br/>\nportfolio evaluator<br/>\nthat could answer any questions and have a demonstration of how to put <br/>\ntogether a portfolio, and what the expectations are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are just endless activities and discussions to choose from, and <br/>\nutilizing the strengths of different parents in the group can be valuable.
