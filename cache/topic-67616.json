Then <br/>\nwe went yard saling and didn&#39;t get home until 3 pm.  I got Alisha <br/>\nlots of books and clothes, a lot of videos the whole family will <br/>\nenjoy, and  I got the boys a neat little tykes thing with <br/>\ninterlocking roads and train track.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile ALisha and I were gone, dh and the boys stayed home and played <br/>\nThomas most of the day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got home I relaxed on the computer for a little while, watched <br/>\nthe boys put their new little tikes toy together, and ordered chinese <br/>\ntake out, which dh picked up.  He also drove Alisha to mcdonalds to <br/>\nsee if they had the latest brat doll and to the hallmark store to get <br/>\nthe american girl pins she earned.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile he was out I played t-ball in the yard with the boys.  When <br/>\nthey stopped needing me to play with them I pulled some weeds while I <br/>\nwatched.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I watched a movie together while Alisha played Zelda and the <br/>\nboys played outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI packaged up some broken Thomas the tank engine stuff  to take <br/>\nadvantage of their lifetime guarantee and promised the boys we&#39;d take <br/>\nit to the post office on Monday.  Alisha and I started reading Frank <br/>\nPeretti&#39;s Cooper kids adventure books, which we got at the yard sales <br/>\ntoday. <br/>\n<br/>\nI took a shower, brushed the boys&#39; teeth, and spent some time with <br/>\nthe boys.  Luke, the 3 year old, and I put a few more links on our <br/>\npaper chain we&#39;ve been making and did a few pages in his Thomas the <br/>\ntank engine magazine (which has a built in workbook which the boys <br/>\nlove!) .  Usually Matt (5) is upstairs with us when we do that but we <br/>\ngot a new game at the mall yesterday and he was downstairs playing <br/>\nthat with his sister.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Matt came up we were done with the magazine.  He put his feet in <br/>\nfront of my nose and I dramatically coughed and gagged and said how <br/>\nstinky they were.  Luke did the same to me, and then I started doing <br/>\nit to them.  It turned into this weird game with all kinds of rules.  <br/>\nIf they said hi before I put my foot in front of their nose, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stop them from putting their foot in front of my nose.  I <br/>\nhad to cough and gag and I couldn&#39;t put my foot in front of their <br/>\nnose until I was done coughing and gagging.  They would run off of <br/>\nLuke&#39;s bed and onto Matt&#39;s bed, which was their base where I couldn&#39;t <br/>\ngo.  Somehow we started counting how many stinky feet were on Luke&#39;s <br/>\nbed.  I would brag, &quot;Ahhhh...only two stinky feet on the bed...and <br/>\nthen Matt would jump on and say, &quot;4 stinky feet&quot;!  Then Luke would <br/>\njump on and we&#39;d say, &quot;6 stinky feet!&quot;  Matt would escape me and be <br/>\nlaughing on his base and say, &quot;Huh-huh, now there&#39;s only 4 stinky <br/>\nfeet on the bed!&quot;  I bet no school has ever taught math exactly that <br/>\nway before! lol   <br/>\n<br/>\nI read the boys a Sesame Street book, sang them each a song and <br/>\ntucked them in.  Then I sang to Alisha and tucked her in.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlong after I went to bed that the boys were in my bed with me.  They <br/>\nlooked at books in bed with me for awhile before they fell asleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Olga&quot; &lt;britcontoo@a...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Everyones posts on their days felt like an invitation to share <br/>\n </span></blockquote>ours.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"Heidi","from":"&quot;Heidi&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"And our day","postDate":"1052023129","msgId":67630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5MjVncCtycWhlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI5MXBrMyszcjF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67628,"nextInTopic":67653,"prevInTime":67629,"nextInTime":67631,"topicId":67616,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"this is some of what our day looked like today.

We may have to cull him since his feet are <br/>\ndeformed. Robby worked hard on his &quot;Top Secret&quot; kit which arrived in <br/>\nthe mail today: puzzles, clues, codes to find what was stolen, and <br/>\nwhodunnit, and where it was stashed after stolen.

I have to do it <br/>\nwith my 2 year old, which I usually dread because the concept of <br/>\ntaking turns does not click, for obvious reasons..LOL!  He was <br/>\nactually great today.  We came home and went for bike rides and then <br/>\nwent out back in our kiddie pool and splashed and played with dad <br/>\nwhere Keiran discovered he could make rainbows with the hose.  The <br/>\nboys got haircuts courtesy of Dad and Mom!  Then me and Keiran (my 4 <br/>\n1/2 yo) went for an archealogical dig in the sandbox.  We have <br/>\nbeen &quot;studying&quot; Egypt.  He got interested after a discovery show.  I <br/>\nfound a great mummy kit so I hid the pieces in the sandbox.  He dug <br/>\nthem up and recorded them in his &quot;notebook&quot; and we weighed the pieces <br/>\njust like real archealogists ;)  Then we came inside and made the <br/>\nmummy (the kit even has organs that come out and are put in the <br/>\ncanopic jars, amulet stickers and a death mask..pretty cool).  We got <br/>\nour Encyclopedia set in the mail, a good bargain as it was hard to <br/>\nfind something still in book format!!  We purused through those for a <br/>\nwhile, although it was more hubby and I!!  Then the family went out <br/>\nfor dinner where we sat on the porch in a swinging bench seat with <br/>\nthe Florida breezes!!  Then we came home and dad and I shared reading <br/>\ntime.  The kids are now making an awful lot of noise in their room <br/>\nwhen they should be sleeping..LOL.  We just put the baby in a bed so <br/>\nhe is enjoying all the freedom that his little toes are providing!! <br/>\n<br/>\nOlga :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67620,"nextTopicId":67674}}
