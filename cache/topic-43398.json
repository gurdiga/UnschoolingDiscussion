Mostly the<br/>\noutcome was good, a rare very creative solution, many times just<br/>\nunderstanding and accepting of later, sometimes practical help to have<br/>\nlater come sooner.

Sometimes one child seems to need more attention than another. Sometimes, I have to ask one to wait awhile. Sometimes an older  child will  do something with another - there is a kind of synergy involved in a large family, where ideas and activities are often shared..Sometimes, I listen to everyone&#39;s wants ( eg  wanting to listen to a book, wanting to play a game now) and I try to find a compromise - writing down their wants/needs is a help.  Little kids really seem to feel reassured that mum is writing down what they want , what they want to do, even if they can&#39;t have it now. I have had mine post this paper on the fridge - they feel it is important...They feel I am listening ( I am!)  and  that I am taking them seriously, even if I can&#39;t stop reading to one at the moment, in order to play a game with another. They know its written down and we&#39;ll get to it...Its not ideal but its give and  take and discussion, and gets easier as they get older... two books already mentioned on this list  that I have found helpful are Siblings Without Rivalry and How To Talk So Kids Can Listen and Listen So Kids can Talk.
