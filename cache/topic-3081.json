However,<br/>\nsometimes a TV show will generate a conversation about something that turns<br/>\nout to be important, and he does a lot of learning via the computer. He<br/>\nhasn&#39;t yet become bored with either medium; maybe someday he will. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now he is in a stage in which he wants (and waits for) me to do a<br/>\nproject with him, even if that means waiting and not doing anything active<br/>\nuntil I finish some housework.  This is where the only child issue comes<br/>\nin: he doesn&#39;t seem motivated to work on an &quot;active&quot; project (even though<br/>\nthe materials are easily available to him) unless he has someone to do it<br/>\nwith (and that means me since he hasn&#39;t a sibling.) Maybe this isn&#39;t just<br/>\nan only child thing; maybe it is just a phase in his personal development<br/>\nor a remainder from school days. Maybe he just finds an activity more fun<br/>\nwhen you share it with someone.

My son would have been in first<br/>\ngrade. He went to a town-run preschool 2 years ago that we both really<br/>\nliked; the teacher was, looking back at it, very creative and the<br/>\nenvironment was open and friendly. (I had only put him in preschool due to<br/>\npressure from everyone for my son to be &quot;socialized&quot; because he is an only<br/>\nchild. If I knew then what I know now!) The preschool teacher had warned us<br/>\nthat kindergarten was MUCH different than preschool, and she was so right.<br/>\nLast year he went to kindergarten and lost all his inner motivation to<br/>\nlearn anything he calls &quot;educational&quot;, which included a lot. He even<br/>\nstopped reading because they had a mandatory reading program for prizes<br/>\nwhich he didn&#39;t want to do. By the end of the year he was &quot;bored&quot; (his<br/>\nwords), and didn&#39;t want to go back. Now the challenge is reawakening his<br/>\ninterest in new things without any appearance of schoolishness. Things are<br/>\nimproving a little each week, but we still have days of nothing but<br/>\ncomputer games and TV, which I find frustrating. I can&#39;t get it out of my<br/>\nhead that we need to have something to show for our days at home when my<br/>\nparents come over or we meet people at the store or at sports events who<br/>\nquestion homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 12:27 AM 09/20/1999 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;olivia,<br/>\n&gt;just curious, do you mean first year after a year of kindergarden or were <br/>\n&gt;there years before that of preschool or other things?
