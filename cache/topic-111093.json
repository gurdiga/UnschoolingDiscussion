The ones who allow themselves to eat what they want (a minority in my group) and those who are strict vegan, vegetarian, only organic or something.  I do like learning about health issues from these people though, just would never be willing to deprive myself to follow in their footsteps:0)Sometimes I think they wonder how on earth my children survive.:0) Now the whole group knows that I don&#39;t monitor my kids&#39; eating so a spirit of tolerance pretty much abounds.<br/>\n  Nobody in our group brings curriculum, thankfully, but I am being asked to expain how unschooing works more and more often.

The excerpts of food stories are similar to ours. We often have <br/>\nlarge containers of ice cream sitting in the freezer for months, same <br/>\ngoes for ice pops and other frozen treats. Sometimes a box can <br/>\ndisappear minutes after I get home from the market. Other times, they <br/>\njust kind of sit there. Same for candy/chocolate. Same for soda <br/>\nalthough, if the kids don&#39;t drink it, dh will chug it so soda doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlast long here. My kids don&#39;t drink water, neither does dh. I mostly <br/>\ndrink iced water but don&#39;t make my kids drink it. Every now and then <br/>\nthey&#39;ll opt for a bottle of cold water instead of juice but this is <br/>\nrare. Dh never was a water drinker. I grew up having no choices over <br/>\nfood/drink. By the time I was a teen, I&#39;d use my money (that I earned) <br/>\nto buy soda and chips when I wasn&#39;t at home or if I were at a friends <br/>\nhouse, I go nuts stuffing my face with all their yummy snacks and <br/>\nbubbly beverages. Two weeks ago, my kids and I went to Stop N Shop. It <br/>\nwas a bad time to go food shopping because we were all starving, we <br/>\nshould have eaten lunch first. While I was waiting to order cold cuts, <br/>\nmy kids were asking me if they could go off and say hi to the lobsters. <br/>\nOff they went, a few minutes later they came back all giggly and <br/>\nexcited jumping up and down. A woman nearby noticed and said &quot;Ah! I bet <br/>\nthey discovered the candy bins and forgot about those lobsters!&quot; My <br/>\noldest came to me and asked &quot;Mommy, we see something we really really <br/>\nwant...only the one I want is kind of expensive, can we get it??&quot; The <br/>\nwoman was so curious hanging on every word that came out of Aiden&#39;s <br/>\nmouth. I asked what it was that&#39;s gotten them so excited and they start <br/>\ndoing a little dance and chant &quot;SUSHI SUSHI...&quot; The woman was shocked <br/>\nand told me that she had never ever heard kids asking for SUSHI!! Aiden <br/>\nwanted some kind of octopus box that was about $10, my other kids <br/>\nwanted california rolls. &quot;Okey dokey then, sushi it is!&quot; So although <br/>\nour family can enjoy fast food and frozen meals like Hot Pockets, they <br/>\nalso enjoy healthy or ethnic choices too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for commercialism and abundance: that is how I see it as well. <br/>\nEverything we buy for our kids are things we know they would enjoy. If <br/>\nit&#39;s within our budget, we don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t buy these things. <br/>\nGranted, we have had some fortunate times and have been able to buy our <br/>\nkids toys or gadgets that are rather costly. Here is an example, our <br/>\nsoon to be 6yo has an iPod. People always tell us that it&#39;s ridiculous <br/>\nthat a little boy has one of these mp3 players. But what they don&#39;t see <br/>\nis that this child loves music. He loves to make his own playlists on <br/>\niTunes and burn his own cd&#39;s or burn ones to give away. His being into <br/>\nmusic and having an iPod and using iTunes has been helping him learn <br/>\nsome parts of reading. He&#39;ll call me into his room and tell me &quot;I love <br/>\nthis song, this is the Ramones--I know that it starts with R and I know <br/>\nthe shape of the word so that&#39;s why I know it says Ramones. Oh and I <br/>\nknow all the bands that start with the word &#39;The&#39;&quot; He never asked for <br/>\nan iPod because of all the commercials, he asked for one because he <br/>\ntook over his dad&#39;s iPod and realized how much he would enjoy having <br/>\nhis own. Now, these adults who balk at our purchases are amazed at how <br/>\nMax knows his way around the music software and the menu on the <br/>\niPod...well how else would he get to learn this if he didn&#39;t have it <br/>\nand have the freedom to use it!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout a feeling of plenty, people are needy and unsettled and <br/>\nunlikely to explore higher thoughts or to practice compassion. They&#39;ll <br/>\nbe too busy trying to get more things/attention/food/whatever so that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t feel needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see this all time in the children of some friends and family.

It&#39;s mainly the larger <br/>\nfunctions where I end up feeling out of place. And yup, my kids eat a <br/>\nwide variety of foods. Sure they love snacking on chips and sweet stuff <br/>\nbut at the same time they love ethnic food and really enjoy trying new <br/>\nflavors and dishes. So it&#39;s not that we eat crap all the time, we just <br/>\nadd some crap in with all the other good stuff lol!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be awesome if we could ever hang out with a family who can <br/>\njust eat anything and it not being a guilt trip or something.

And it never fails, <br/>\nthe other kids will come around us and kinda stare at us and our <br/>\n&quot;stuff&quot;. My kids will offer out any snacks or food they are willing to <br/>\nshare and even offer to take turns with their hand held gaming stuff or <br/>\nshare earphones for their ipods. I get uncomfortable looks from the <br/>\nmoms and they will either politely remind their kids they have their <br/>\nown snacks or that right now is time for playing outside and not time <br/>\nfor video games or every now and then the parent will simply thank us <br/>\nfor sharing and allow their children to mingle with us and our &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are forever scrutinized for the things we buy our children (or <br/>\nourselves). Friends and neighbors constantly like to tell us how we <br/>\nhave too many toys, too many computers and techie gadgets, too many <br/>\nbooks, too many varieties or snacks or cereals, too much clothing, too <br/>\nmany shoes, too much of everything. But each of us enjoy all that we <br/>\nhave and all that we set out to own. Whatever ends up not being used or <br/>\nnot being as fun as we thought it might be, we always find new homes <br/>\nfor =P The one I particularly get a kick out of, too many books!! Dh <br/>\nand I are not too fond of the library, nothing against it, just that we <br/>\nnever return the books on time plus we like to jot notes in the margins <br/>\nsometimes and also like having certain books on hand for future <br/>\nreference or rereading. Sooo...we buy the books we all want. What is <br/>\nthe big deal?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have this neighbor who has similarly aged children. Their family and <br/>\nours were friends for a little while until personality clashes surfaced <br/>\n(between me and the mother) as well as clashes between parenting and <br/>\neducation styles. It was too much for my children and dh/I to witness <br/>\nthe spankings, humiliation, and tongue lashings their kids would <br/>\nreceive in front of us. Now we are just civil but we don&#39;t get together <br/>\nany more. When our kids are outside, they play. When my kids invite <br/>\ntheir kids in, all of a sudden they are not allowed in anymore. The <br/>\noldest (8yo) told me they are not allowed to come over my house because <br/>\nthey have too much fun and because we have too many toys!!! The dad <br/>\ntold my dh that our lifestyle causes a problem for them. Why? Because <br/>\ntheir kids come home saying how much fun they had making real play <br/>\ndough, they had fun building a russian building out of wooden blocks, <br/>\nhad a blast creating window decorations out of perler beads, were <br/>\nthrilled that they can use the boys computer to play cartoonnetwork <br/>\ngames, and love that our house is like a video game wonderland!! The <br/>\ndad said they end up asking to have what our kids have. The mom likes <br/>\nto yell at them &quot;thou shall not covet thy neighbors TOYS!! Be grateful <br/>\nyou have anything at all!!&quot; They don&#39;t like that their kids come home <br/>\nfeeling like home is a fun place if you let it be. Their kids seemed to <br/>\nhave this brainwashed mantra when they used to be allowed to play here. <br/>\nThey&#39;d tell my kids &quot;I dont know why you&#39;re not allowed to go to <br/>\nschool. School is where you learn, without school, you&#39;ll never know <br/>\nanything!&quot; My oldest can&#39;t stand these comments. He&#39;d tell her <br/>\n&quot;Actually, that&#39;s not true at all. Maybe it&#39;s true for you but it&#39;s not <br/>\ntrue for me and my brother and sisters. We learn almost everything we <br/>\nknow by ourselves. We&#39;re like...our own teachers. I bet there&#39;s a lot <br/>\nof times your teacher wants to teach you things that you aren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in right? Well, that doesn&#39;t happen at home. We learn what <br/>\nwe want to, when we want to, because it&#39;s fun that way and we end up <br/>\nlearning stuff better. That&#39;s what I know at least.&quot; The girl will <br/>\nshrug and they&#39;ll go on playing. And then the last time they were here, <br/>\nthe oldest girl states to me &quot;OOooh now I get it!! Your kids just have <br/>\nfun all day every day and do the things they feel like doing and you <br/>\nhelp them learn if they need it?? But otherwise they just learn things <br/>\nlike by playing sorta?&quot; So this too is why the parents don&#39;t want them <br/>\nhere anymore. Their kids end up wanting to learn how my kids learn, <br/>\nthey see that their parents are wrong when they say that all kids only <br/>\nwill learn by going to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was especially made super clear when the 8yo girl came over to <br/>\nshow off her special award she got from her teacher (for reading). She <br/>\ntold my 8yo that she is an advanced reader and the rest of the kids in <br/>\nher class are not. She wanted to know what level he was at. He told her <br/>\nthat it was nice she got an award although he didn&#39;t really understand <br/>\nthe purpose of the award. He said he had no idea what she was talking <br/>\nabout when she asked what level he was at. She tried to explain it but <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t grasping it. He told her that the only levels he&#39;s aware of <br/>\nare levels of video games. He said that he has no reading level. He <br/>\ntold her he learned how to read on his own (6.5yo) that he reads what <br/>\nhe wants & when he needs to. He told her that there really isn&#39;t <br/>\nanything he can&#39;t read but there are things he chooses not to read <br/>\nbecause they are not interesting at that given moment. She was shocked <br/>\nat this. &quot;What do you mean you learned how to read on your own??? You <br/>\nmean, your mom taught you right?&quot; He told her &quot;What? Like you think a <br/>\nkid always needs an adult to teach them to read? Not true. No one <br/>\ntaught me anything. If you wanna know my secret, it&#39;s this: I decoded <br/>\nthe ways of letters and words by watching a lot of Digimon when I was <br/>\n2-3yo and then playing and beating as many video games as possible and <br/>\nfinally tv--nickelodeon and cartoon network. That&#39;s how I learned <br/>\nreading ok??!!&quot; This was yet another thing that was completely opposite <br/>\nto what their parents tell them. [sorry for going off on a tangent]<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to chuckle at a lot of your points because so much of it <br/>\ndescribed us =D The little people for example. We&#39;ve got city loads of <br/>\nem lol!! This is yet another thing some folks like to poke at me for. <br/>\nWhy do your kids need ten thousand little people and sets? My answer: <br/>\nwhy not? My first child received several LP sets, I saved them for the <br/>\nnext kid who also received a few different ones, saved those, so on and <br/>\nso forth. So we&#39;ve accumulated a lot. But what my kids DO with them I <br/>\nalways think is so cool!! My oldest is 8.5yo and still can find joy in <br/>\nsetting up a village along with his younger siblings. They take on <br/>\ndifferent roles and different themes each time. Sometimes they spread <br/>\ntheir villages out across different rooms and make roads with wooden <br/>\ntracks..their play becomes very detailed and elaborate. That&#39;s <br/>\nawesome!! Same goes for their legos, Imaginext, and what not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we&#39;ll have those same folks over who tsk tsk at our immense amount <br/>\nof toys but then will be amazed at what our kids do with them. They&#39;ll <br/>\ncompliment the kids and say something nice about having such great <br/>\nimaginations and then end it with &quot;but you really do have too many <br/>\ntoys&quot;. Ugh. We&#39;ll have adults here who&#39;ll end up playing or building <br/>\nsomething with Bonz, hexabits, Geomags, haba blocks, perler beads, what <br/>\nhave you and they&#39;ll say how they wished they got to grow up learning <br/>\nin this way instead of going to school!! And every now and then they&#39;ll <br/>\nget a better understanding of how our kids end up learning. Oh yes, I <br/>\nforgot to add. Aside from folks thinking we have too many toys, they <br/>\nthink we have too many &quot;adult&quot; art supplies as well. One time on a <br/>\ngorgeous spring day, I brought out an easel, watercolor paper, and <br/>\nprofessional grade watercolor in tubes. I also had the usual kid stuff <br/>\nlike giant chalks and chalk paints. Some neighbors came around to say <br/>\nhello and could not believe I was letting the kids &quot;waste&quot; expensive <br/>\nwatercolor paint. But I don&#39;t see it that way. The type of watercolors <br/>\nthey used are vibrant and give my kids the truer sense of color and <br/>\nappreciation for watercolors (IMO). One adult actually attempted to <br/>\nplace limitations on my child by telling her she was squeezing out too <br/>\nmuch or putting too much color in one spot. Then some of the people <br/>\nwere shocked that I didn&#39;t flinch or bat an eye when my toddler was <br/>\nusing the chalk paint as a tattooing medium lol!! She sat on the <br/>\ndriveway, took her shirt off, and began painting her legs, arms, chest, <br/>\nhead, and face. She was so content and peaceful and seemed to really be <br/>\nin a creative flow. I saw nothing but joy beaming from her while the <br/>\nother adults saw nothing but mess and waste =(<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I basically just wanted to pop in and say that it&#39;s nice to hear <br/>\nthat you have a new outlook on having a lot of toys =D<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 14<br/>\n    Date: Mon, 9 Jan 2006 15:26:08 -0500<br/>\n    From: Su Penn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:supenn@...\">supenn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: RE: too many toys, was commericalism<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer think we have &quot;too many&quot; toys.
