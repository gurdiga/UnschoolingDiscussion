We turned the TV on ONCE when he<br/>\nwas about 7 months, and even though both of us were in the room and there<br/>\nwere plenty of other things to do and look at -- which he was always<br/>\notherwise perfectly happy with -- once he spotted that TV picture, it was<br/>\nlike there was nothing else in the room.  No matter what else happened<br/>\nfor<br/>\nthe next five minutes, he would not take his eyes off that screen.<br/>\nNeedless to say, that was all we needed to know; it was enough for us. <br/>\nThe<br/>\nTV has stayed OFF ever since.  Shortly, I am building a wall-mount<br/>\ncabinet<br/>\nthat will cover the TV with locked doors.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt you would come to any other conclusion based on your feelings<br/>\nabout TV.  It makes perfect sense that your son would be entranced by<br/>\nanything so new to him, we got the same reaction from my son at the same<br/>\nage when we put a string of Christmas lights.  Obviously, parents must<br/>\nmake the best choice they can for their children but I got an oppressive<br/>\nfeeling from reading what you had to say here.  I get an image of this<br/>\n&quot;cabinet&quot; with &quot;locked doors&quot; as constant reminder to your child that you<br/>\nhold all the keys/control.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have since noticed this in other children when at friends&#39; houses --<br/>\nthe<br/>\nkids barely even acknowledge that you&#39;re there, they can&#39;t take their<br/>\neyes<br/>\noff the screen, and basically seem hypnotized.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you come to the same conclusion if they were engrossed in a book or<br/>\nexperiment and barely acknowledged you?  There is a lot of propaganda out<br/>\nthere about TV with little to no evidence to back it up.  It wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nmatter how much they were learning, many see kids watching TV and knee<br/>\njerk reaction is &quot;Look at that, they&#39;re hypnotized!&quot;  I see the same look<br/>\nwhen kids are watching someone read a story, if I had been conditioned to<br/>\nthink books are bad I would probably come to a negative conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Now this brings up a question.  I know in many states that<br/>\nhomeschoolers<br/>\nare required to adminster state-mandated tests tot heir own children. <br/>\nHow<br/>\ndo Unschoolers handle these requirements?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany go underground and simply don&#39;t register.  I haven&#39;t heard from even<br/>\none who has had any trouble.  Some older kids can deal with regurgitating<br/>\nenough stuff to pass tests but it isn&#39;t what I would want for mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
