Since then, I went out and purchased a Canadian copy of the GED prep<br/>\nbook.  Now I have some peace as to how we&#39;ll deal with the finishing out<br/>\nperiod of their home education.<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Diane, for responding to my writing question.  I have been so busy<br/>\nlately, that I was able to read posts, but couldn&#39;t put my thoughts into<br/>\nwords to continue the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wanted to say, is that I want to teach my girls the formula for the<br/>\nfive paragraph essay.  It&#39;s important to me, that they are prepared to<br/>\ntackle any practical piece of writing should the need arise.  My 15 yr old<br/>\ndaughter has ADD, and can write creatively with amazing ease, but as far a<br/>\nputting her thoughts into a practial piece of writing, she definitely has a<br/>\nstruggle.  The 13 yr old is better with the 5 paragraph formula, but<br/>\ncreatively is less at ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not exactly unschoolers because there are things that I feel<br/>\nresponsible to teach them, whether they choose to learn them or not, such as<br/>\nthe 3 R&#39;s, but in other respects, I do not load them down with mountains of<br/>\nassignments; instead, we read out loud and discuss whatever we want to<br/>\nlearn, and avoid textbooks.  They do work out of &quot;Key To&quot; consumable math<br/>\nbooks which are excellent for any of you who haven&#39;t tried them yet, and do<br/>\n&quot;Wordly Wise&quot; for vocabulary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff & Diane Gwirtz wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Jeff & Diane Gwirtz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jagwirtz@...\">jagwirtz@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Have you talked about the writing process much, on this loop?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; LOL!!  I think we&#39;ve talked about how resistant some of our children<br/>\n&gt; are to writing ANYTHING - especially boys it seems.  My 13 year old<br/>\n&gt; will do almost anything to avoid writing. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4144,"nextTopicId":4160}}
