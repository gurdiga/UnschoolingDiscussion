(We began years ago by making a list <br/>\nthat we posted to the refrigerator that could be referenced when <br/>\nsomeone got bored. Just having this list posted saved a lot of <br/>\ncloudy-eyed wandering through the house...) This list applies to all <br/>\nthe ages of our kids ranging between 7-17. We have five children.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Find a sibling and play a board game (list of games we own)<br/>\n2. Jump on the trampoline<br/>\n3. Kick the soccer ball<br/>\n4. Make a tent out of sheets in the living room and eat snacks under it<br/>\n5. Call a friend on the phone to chat or to come play<br/>\n6. Dress up and pretend<br/>\n7. Play drama games (we have a book of these and we are theater hounds)<br/>\n8. Make tea and muffins, invite others to join you. Set table and light <br/>\ncandles.<br/>\n9. Cut flowers, make a bouquet<br/>\n10. Bake clay creations using sculpey clay (I try to buy a fresh set of <br/>\ncolors every few months)<br/>\n11. Use mom&#39;s binoculars to watch birds.<br/>\n12. Cut paper and glue it.<br/>\n13. Use the Prismacolors to draw (refer to &quot;how to draw&quot; books on book <br/>\nshelves)<br/>\n14. Draw with sidewalk chalk<br/>\n15. Play in the creek<br/>\n16. Play the piano or saxophone or guitar<br/>\n17. Go online and play a game on the Internet, or X Box Live<br/>\n18. Pop popcorn; watch a movie<br/>\n19. Start a fire (winter, in the fireplace. Summer; in the outdoor <br/>\nfireplace) roast hotdogs or marshmellows.<br/>\n20. Make popsicles.<br/>\n21. Read a book<br/>\n22. Memorize a poem<br/>\n23. Write a poem<br/>\n24. Choreograph a dance in the living room<br/>\n25. Write on your bedroom walls things you want to remember - song <br/>\nlyrics, friend&#39;s names, funny jokes<br/>\n26. Keep a scrapbook<br/>\n27. Take some pictures<br/>\n28. Make origami<br/>\n29. Make and hang Chinese lanterns from a string across the kitchen<br/>\n30. Play croquet or badminton<br/>\n31. Bake cookies<br/>\n32.

Take a walk with a bottle of water<br/>\n40. Create a cozy hiding place (blankets, pillow) and bring your <br/>\nheadphones/CD player to it. Sit quietly reading or listening or <br/>\nsnoozing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should be enough to get anyone started. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Boredom","postDate":"1084280817","msgId":93846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3cWo1aCtvZGJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdDNDI0M0RBLUEzNTItMTFEOC05QTIyLTAwMEE5NUYwRjU2QUBicmF2ZXdyaXRlci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":93830,"nextInTopic":93856,"prevInTime":93845,"nextInTime":93847,"topicId":16689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I like the idea of the list on the refrigerator.

This is despite books, play station, PC etc etc. <br/>\nIt is true that we don&#39;t see many people - actually we only know 1 <br/>\nunschooler in this area - so I know my kids are lonely and miss their <br/>\nEnglish friends but when I was there age we lived on a farm with no-<br/>\none for miles so we made our own amusement. They don&#39;t want to play <br/>\noutside cos its too hot and humid and there are ticks.<br/>\nI&#39;m beginning to feel a bit depressed at the thought of the long <br/>\nsummer stretching ahead, stcuk inside with three unmotivated kids :-(<br/>\nI&#39;ve asked them if they want to sign up for any of those *camp* <br/>\nthings but unless I go with them they don&#39;t want too. (and to be <br/>\nhonest I find them very schooly and artificial and full of kids <br/>\ndumped there by their parents who don&#39;t want them around everyday)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe eldest is bored cos she only has 1 friend. 11 year old <br/>\nhomeschooling girls who aren&#39;t Christian are a bit thin on the <br/>\nground. The youngest doesn&#39;t have any friends his age now in this <br/>\narea. He had one but the mother disapproved of his long hair and <br/>\nunschooling - I think her son started to ask why he had to do <br/>\nworkbooks and have his hair short ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo other people go through this too?
