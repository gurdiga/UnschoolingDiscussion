You drop <br/>\noff books at used book stores, park benches, airports, etc. with a <br/>\nlabel in that they&#39;re part of this program.  People who find the book <br/>\nare supposed to go to the website and enter into a journal you&#39;ve <br/>\nmade up for the book where the book ended up, whether or not they <br/>\nliked the book, etc.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bookcrossing.com\">http://www.bookcrossing.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39608,"nextTopicId":39620}}
