I have in my mind the idea of the empty table on <br/>\nwhich things semi magically appear that are either relevant or new and <br/>\ndifferent.  But the reality is that the dining room table is our office and <br/>\nstrewn with mail.  I try to clear it off if it&#39;s not stuff someone&#39;s <br/>\nworking on, but it&#39;s rarely near empty.  I hate to spend so much time <br/>\nstraightening up too.
