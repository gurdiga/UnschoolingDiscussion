My<br/>\nson is 8 & 1/2 and has been home since about Feb 1.  He was in public<br/>\nschool (3rd grade) in Arkansas.  I am so interested in doing this for<br/>\nhim.  He is a gifted child and extremely bright.  However, he hates<br/>\nschool!  I need some advice and feedback, I think.  My husband is<br/>\nvery, very supportive of all of this, but is having trouble with the<br/>\n&quot;unstructuredness&quot; of it all.  Both my son and I are similar in that<br/>\nwe are very unstructured, spontaneous learners, where my husband is<br/>\ncompletely the opposite..very methodical, very routine-oriented.  I<br/>\nam trying NOT to push my son.  He is resisting ANY schooling right<br/>\nnow.  All he seems to want to do is play video games and watch TV! <br/>\nHe hates to write, for one thing.  Which is one thing he detested<br/>\nabout school.  I haven&#39;t seemed to find the &quot;spark&quot; for him yet. <br/>\nHe&#39;s interested in EVERYTHING, it seems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I am rambling here!  Is there anything wrong with letting my<br/>\nson stay up late and sleep late?  My husband seems to think he should<br/>\nhave a set bedtime and get up early to start his day.  Guess what? <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t seem to work with Benjamin (my son).  Which is one of<br/>\nthe reasons I chose to take him out of public schools!  They seemed<br/>\nmuch more interested in recording attendance than they did<br/>\nchallenging and stimulating my child!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI will close for now...not sure if any of this makes sense.
