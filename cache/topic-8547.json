It was supposed to start in 3rd grade but now I <br/>\nfind out it starts in 4th.  And he is in 1st grade officially so . . . by <br/>\nthat time we may be so spoiled as to have completely given up on any thought <br/>\nof ps but who knows . . . the beauty of hsing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, welcome!! My son is also 7 yo (his birthday is today!) and my <br/>\ndaughter is 5 1/2 yo.  They are both very bright and basically that is the <br/>\nreason we hs.  The curric at the ps was pathetic and the accommodations <br/>\navailable were completely inadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do a mixed bag of lots of library visits, gardening, beaching, outside <br/>\nlessons (piano and dance and Tae Kwon Do), science stuff, reading, reading, <br/>\nreading, and then some more playing.  I guess we are unschooling but some <br/>\ndays do seem pretty structured -- some not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure as you browse aound the web and the library you will gets lots of <br/>\ninfo (probably too much!) on the different approaches to hsing.  But, I <br/>\nthink, you basically have to figure it out for yourself -- find out what <br/>\nsuits you and yours.  You are right -- there is no welcoming committee and <br/>\nset of instructions!  :)  But that&#39;s really a good thing once you get used to <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk lots of questions!  We are pretty new to all of this but someone on this <br/>\nor another list will be able to help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with everything!<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"ethomp","from":"&quot;ethomp&quot; &lt;ethomp@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"DFLusrYLhhzGQ4TZAoK086tNadRxgoAKhlsUCvEO0L40jZCe_jGXgD49GkrPONPFUm38TlBWklG6Z8mVsqhTJQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Member","postDate":"958622603","msgId":8547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjMwMWJmYzA3ZSQwM2VhZTA0MCQ2NWNlOTljZUBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PFBpbmUuMy4wNy4xMDAwNTE3MjI0Ni5BNTMwMS1jMTAwMDAwQGFjbWU+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8556,"prevInTime":8546,"nextInTime":8548,"topicId":8547,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Renee!

My name is Liz, and I just<br/>\nstarted this myself as well.  I haven&#39;t even started teaching my kids yet,<br/>\nthat will take place next beginning in the fall.  However, I can fully<br/>\nrelate to you.  When a person decides to take that step to homeschool, they<br/>\nARE stepping into uncharted territory (at least for themselves).  I also<br/>\nthought the same thing, that there was no &quot;welcoming&quot; committee....it would<br/>\nhave helped to have someone take me by the hand and &quot;show&quot; me what to do.<br/>\nBut, of course, there&#39;s no such thing.  However, I have found this email<br/>\nlist to be very beneficial, and things seem to be falling into place.  I get<br/>\nbits and pieces of information to put together, but basically it&#39;s a &quot;figure<br/>\nit out for yourself&quot; thing, because only you know what is best for your<br/>\nindividual child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 children ages 4,5,10 and 12 that I will begin homeschooling next<br/>\nyear.  I have just decided that I&#39;ve had enough of school violence.  Also my<br/>\noldest son is ahead of his grade.  In the second grade, he could do algebra<br/>\nin his head.  He is now in the sixth grade, and after 4 years of talking to<br/>\nteachers (and others), I can&#39;t get anyone to advance and challenge him.  My<br/>\n5 year old is NOT ready for socialization with other kids.  She thinks<br/>\nEVERYTHING should be her way.  So these are my reasons for deciding to<br/>\nhomeschool, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the right choice for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to let it over-whelm you.  I&#39;ve been doing the same thing myself,<br/>\nand I find it difficult to concentrate and put things together myself when I<br/>\nstress out....I lose all focus, and make things worse.  And it&#39;s not that<br/>\nbad at all.  If you need someone to talk to, feel free to contact me.  I<br/>\nwish you all the best!<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Renee Lester &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rlester@...\">rlester@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 17, 2000 9:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] New Member<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone.  I just subbed to this list yesterday.  I am very<br/>\n&gt; new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>\n&gt; people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of<br/>\n&gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>\n&gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>\n&gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>\n&gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>\n&gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>\n&gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>\n&gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>\n&gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>\n&gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>\n&gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>\n&gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>\n&gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>\n&gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>\n&gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>\n&gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted<br/>\nterritories,<br/>\n&gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>\n&gt; but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>\n&gt; find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>\n&gt; determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>\n&gt; feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that<br/>\n&gt; my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>\n&gt; of everyone involved.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Renee<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Free Music: Take it with you!
