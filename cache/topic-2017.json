I enjoy writing and the written word.  And also<br/>\ndo calligraphy as a hobby.  I get compliments on my handwriting<br/>\nfrequently...ususally by people who *wish*  they had nice penmanship.<br/>\nGuess it&#39;s a talent,  and learned (practiced) skill....so for those who love<br/>\nit great,  and for others,  as long as people can understand your<br/>\ncommunications, it doesn&#39;t matter.   Hopefully,  we can all appreciate each<br/>\nother&#39;s varying talents...i.e.,  people who dont draw or paint well still<br/>\nadmire Monets,  Renoirs,  etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE:  The gifted label..........<br/>\nI, too,  was good at *school*  as a child - skipped a grade in grade school,<br/>\nread way above my grade level.  Our school didnn&#39;t have a gifted program,<br/>\nso we were called &quot;brains&quot; (derogatory) by other students.<br/>\nThankfully,  college was generally more of an unschooling experience.  And<br/>\nby the time I was finished getting academic awards there....I had also<br/>\ngained the self knowledge to know I needed to learn &#39;everyday living&#39;<br/>\nskills;  and I had gained the courage to tell my professor that I would not<br/>\nbe going on to graduate school right away. (he was disappointed,  but I&#39;m<br/>\nconvinced I would&#39;ve become an *educated dimwit*)  I think I&#39;ve managed to<br/>\ngain much more balance between *common sense*  and intelligence.  I&#39;ve also<br/>\ngained an appreciation for intelligence....I don&#39;t think I&#39;m superior in<br/>\nanyway (in fact I often feel inferior to those with high emotional<br/>\nintelligence or &quot;people smarts&quot;)....but I hope I can use the<br/>\nintelligence/talents I do have to serve others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $ 0.02!!<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2015,"nextTopicId":2019}}
