But, to just casually, for no <br/>\ngood reason, use language that you know is unsettling to someone else <br/>\nis discourteous and uncaring. Doing anything that makes another person <br/>\nuncomfortable or feel insulted should be done only for a good reason. <br/>\nSo what if it is &quot;their problem?&quot; If we have the ability, simply by <br/>\navoiding the use of certain words when they might be unappreciated, to <br/>\ncreate more harmonious social situations and avoid offense, why not do <br/>\nit?**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is great Pam!
