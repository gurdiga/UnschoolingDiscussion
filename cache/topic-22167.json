As I am<br/>\nbecoming more hermit-like myself I may not follow<br/>\nthrough, but my child has interests that I&#39;ve seen in<br/>\nparades and such with 4H banners (he has a horse,<br/>\ngoat, rabbits, we have chickens, dogs, cats, etc.) and<br/>\nat county fairs (haven&#39;t been myself in years, but<br/>\nchildren have).  Do you have to start your own<br/>\ninterest group or what&gt;&gt;<br/>\nSharon--I know that 4H does have websites--I don&#39;t have the link off-hand. They are part of your county extension service.There&#39;s projects for all kinds of things--animals, beginning laundry(yes, it&#39;s true), rocketry, geneology, cooking, creative writing and so on... My older dd is taking dog obedience for the 3rd year, and the younger one is taking Memories Partner--a project with her grandmother.  <br/>\nMy older dd also has a horse, but won&#39;t be doing 4H with him.  She&#39;s interested in non-violent animal training and is working with both the dogs and horse in this way.<br/>\n  We joined an already functioning group--there are 52 kids in the club, but you can start your own, too.  <br/>\n When we begin the art project, I&#39;ll post pictures--right now we&#39;re in the planning stages.<br/>\n  Time to go outside!!! It&#39;s not raining !!!!!! <br/>\n   Debra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22128,"nextTopicId":22156}}
