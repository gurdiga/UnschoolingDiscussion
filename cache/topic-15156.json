And she&#39;s 10!&quot;  It seems to me a clear<br/>\nstatement that we all have different needs when it comes to socializing.<br/>\nSome of us like big crowds, like lots of people, some like one-to-one, some<br/>\nlike parties and some like activities and some like libraries.<br/>\nI said the same thing that you said about my 10 year old when she was 4<br/>\n(that home is better for her temperament) and we made  the decision to carry<br/>\nthrough with home education.  She was overwhelmed by the large numbers of<br/>\nchildren at groups and has always preferred a small group.  I tried not get<br/>\nworried, not see myself  in this shy little girl.  She has blossomed over<br/>\nthe last few months.  Suddenly it is drama club and ice skating parties and<br/>\npen pals and staying with other home-ed friends, and them staying here, and<br/>\ngoing out to the shops on her own, and of course, hours on the phone. :-)<br/>\nMy point is that as unschoolers, our children make their own decisions about<br/>\nwhat they do and learn, including socialization.   We all have our own<br/>\ntimetables for our development, and others do not know what that is. Still,<br/>\nthey can be very good at undermining our confidence,  making all sorts of<br/>\nstatements based on what  they &#39;think&#39;.  My response, if somebody were to<br/>\nmake comments about maladjusted adults would be, depending on my mood, 1) to<br/>\nask where the research is which says this?  There isn&#39;t any. 2)  To say &quot;you<br/>\nare absolutely right.  Nobody I know who went to school has any relationship<br/>\nproblems!&quot;<br/>\n;-)  3) Ask them if it is appropriate for you to tell them how they should<br/>\nbe socializing? It is not, and it is equally inappropriate for them to be<br/>\ntelling you and your child. 4) Or I would point out that  there are loads of<br/>\nkids and groups out there that you can interact with who either don&#39;t go to<br/>\nschool or are available after school hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the problem with these people? Quite frankly, it isn&#39;t any of their<br/>\nbusiness.  I admit that I get  hostile more often than I used to for the<br/>\nsimple reason that I have heard people say things like this so many times.<br/>\nThese of course are the same people who complain about bullying, peer<br/>\npressure, consumer competition, drugs, kids making fun of each other (for<br/>\nbeing smart, or dumb, or wearing non-brand name trainers), power struggles<br/>\nand hierarchy, peer dependence, stress about grades, and all of the rest of<br/>\nthe wonderful pathological socialization which happens to institutionalised<br/>\ngroups.<br/>\nIt seems so obvious to me that these things not only happen IN schools, but<br/>\nhappen BECAUSE of schools.<br/>\nI suppose I will climb down from my soapbox now. I think you get the idea<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t worry about my kids socialization.   I would however worry if<br/>\nthey were in school.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still in the early days of unschooling.

I&#39;m not so extreme as to think <br/>\nthat nothing good can come out of the schools, but at what sacrifice? <br/>\nHomeschooled kids can be raised in an insulated way, never dealing with or <br/>\nthe real world or interacting with people different from themselves. I would <br/>\nsay, though, that they would be the exception and were not really educated at <br/>\nall. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost homeschooled, and especially unschooled, children are involved in life. <br/>\nThey talk to the people they meet when you go on errands, learn to deal with <br/>\nthe neighborhood kids of different ages, meet people when they volunteer or <br/>\ntake a class or seminar. They participate in sports, visit with the elderly <br/>\nor help care for younger children. They make friends at the park or the <br/>\nskating rink, or in 4-H or Scouts. They are too busy being involved with <br/>\npeople to worry about being properly socialized.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you already know what kind of education you want for your <br/>\nchild.
