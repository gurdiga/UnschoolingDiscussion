My 10yo dd has had this happen too.  My heart breaks because we make so much progress with her self esteem and then it is so easily knocked down.  Not to mention the immediate feelings of guilt I get for not working more on her times tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we need to give them more preparation for these things.  What would you say to those kids if you were in her shoes?  Give them a confident reply.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll those conversations about different learning styles, what she knows over them...those are lost at times like that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a good learning experience for realizing the damage you can do to another person with your words.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would go ahead and get her a math workbook.  You can get those spectrum ones that are by grade and tell her to work at her own pace.  She may love it, she may hate it.  It&#39;s cheaper than a curriculum and will give her what she is looking for.  I have one child that adores her workbooks and my 10 hates them...but that is what she pulls out when she runs into something like that. (I buy them for the 10 too, because inevitably she feels jilted if she doesn&#39;t get one) <br/>\n<br/>\nThey also use those workbooks when they &quot;play school&quot; with their friends.  They enjoy checking each others work.  And the answers are right in back...mine use these to check their own work....not so mortifying to catch your own mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a difference, help support the relief efforts in the U.S.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp\">http://clubs.lycos.com/live/events/september11.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"RValvo7626@aol.com","from":"RValvo7626@...","profile":"rvalvo7626","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"nrMz4v7rjWSwdPQPRRSzZ8-HYiwqeYZqcyb8kE5Ig-uiWEmxfPwK0eGGXcEb334oOvFt9ThOQeT0","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1547","postDate":"1004036241","msgId":27011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Mi4zOTcwMTY3LjI5MDliYTkxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27007,"nextInTopic":27017,"prevInTime":27010,"nextInTime":27012,"topicId":27005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/25/01 6:13:54 AM Mountain Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1945528046\">In a message dated 10/25/01 6:13:54 AM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; And, exactly who is the money going to?
