There&#39;s always someone who&#39;s kids are taken everywhere, do tons of courses and build weather stations in the back garden. Will they grow up to rule the world? Probably not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have multiple sclerosis, a child with cerebral palsy, no transport but I still unschool my older 3 (and the baby). About once in a month we get the energy together on a non-hospital day to go out. Last friday we went to the zoo. I was knackered as its a two bus ride journey. The rest of the time the kids do their own thing. They walk to the shops, go out on their bikes, play in the garden, play computer games, watch TV, make a mess in the kitchen while cooking, read books, play games, look up stuff on the internet, fight, squabble, fetch me cups of tea, sing to the baby, design super-wheelchairs for the baby, try and play the tin whistle etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll sounds like great unschooling to me. Some of life is fun, some bits are boring. Learning to deal with both bits is vital.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the important thing...they are much happier than they would be in school having facts ground into them, being forced to play a sport they hate and having to pretend to me trendy or whatever to fit in.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n ALL-NEW Yahoo!

They will have an opportunity to learn about service and selflessness and compassion that many of us may never have.  I am not sick, yet still my children do not get taken everywhere they might like, nor do I play with them whenever they would like simply because there are other demands on my time and resources that prevent this from happening; rather than being resentful, they simply learn that one doesn&#39;t get everything in life all at once, nor do we always get what we want.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am sure your children will be fine.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\nDiamondlady1025 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:diamondlady1025@...\">diamondlady1025@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nHi All!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering something....<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there has been much discussion here lately about unschooling a child<br/>\nwith special needs, and why it is so beneficial to unschool in general and<br/>\nalso with children whom have special needs, however, I have been wondering<br/>\nabout something, what about unschooling for the reasons of the parent or<br/>\nparents whom have special needs?
