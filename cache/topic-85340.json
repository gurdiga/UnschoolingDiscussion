I room <br/>\nshared with 2 other families last time to make it affordable.  We had <br/>\na great time and no one complained about being cramped and no one <br/>\nfought over the bathroom.  I know there will be people looking to <br/>\nroom share.  Even if you only share with one other family, that cuts <br/>\nyour hotel bill in half.  Transportation costs from the cape has got <br/>\nto be less than a tank of gas.  You&#39;d pay too much on gas driving <br/>\nback and forth, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did after hours:  <br/>\n*We sat around the pool drinking wine and getting to know each other <br/>\nuntil the security guard kicked us out an hour after he was supposed <br/>\nto (he wouldn&#39;t stay and have a glass of wine with us, I asked). <br/>\n*Unable to tear ourselves away and allow this night to end, a group <br/>\nof us went to one room to hang out a little longer.<br/>\n*Teens hung out together until 3 am when they were ready for bed <br/>\n(remember a lot of teens are coming from a time zone where 3am for us <br/>\nis only midnight to them.)<br/>\n*We still made the 9am speaker (most of us). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, come Elizabeth.
