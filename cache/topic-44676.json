It is immaterial whether the reason for the loss is finacial, or educational, or even motivational.  The loss exists. HS is the least of the causes, and probably is the best repair.  Learning to do what is meaningful to oneself, regrdless of the difficutlies of the task or the reward, is more likely to inspire the man or woman who cures the common cold (cancer, altzheimers etc etc.) than are the children who are shunted through the typical educational system, and told, repeatedly, if they don&#39;t make a particular cut of one kind or another (SAT&#39;s, tests of all sorts) that they are limited in what they can become.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe person who cures a disease, finds a way for us to travel to a distant galaxy, proves or disproves that there is a TOE (theory of everything...forget the other acronym) will need to put in hour upon hour, most likely, of poorly funded, unreward work, till they reach their final goal.

I think for most of our lives, meaning our lives as humans not my own 44 years here....succes is either fame or fortune...because these are what stand out.  It is difficult to point to success as happiness because we never really know how someone else feels.  I don&#39;t know that success is what it is all about.  I am not even sure that happiness is the goal.  To me the goal is to have peace of mind about what you are doing...to feel it is worthwhile and that you, as a person are significant and matter to at least someone  else in the world.

This is a serious philosophical issue: If you stay at home<br/>\n  and teach your child rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his<br/>\n  child rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his child rocket<br/>\n  science, when does anyone ever become a rocket scientist?

And I don¹t believe that<br/>\n  either is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If home-schooling were institutionalized, half of the youthful potential of<br/>\n  Americans would go unfulfilled. Say that a bright young parent sacrifices a<br/>\n  rewarding career to stay at home and teach the children. When those children<br/>\n  grow up, would half of them (one parent from each married couple) also<br/>\n  sacrifice their potential to stay home and teach their own children? If so,<br/>\n  much of the result of home-schooling would be the creation of more<br/>\n  home-schooling parents for the next generation, and so on.<br/>\n  Maybe home-schoolers can justify this loss. If so, please write. I believe<br/>\n  that home-schooling is a noble experiment done for the right reasons, and I<br/>\n  hope to hear why it may prove to be a success.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And her week-later response:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids are doing and their<br/>\n  high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed my concern that a large<br/>\n  percentage of the kids would never use their educations if they became<br/>\n  home-schoolers themselves.

And I don¹t believe that<br/>\neither is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf home-schooling were institutionalized, half of the youthful potential of<br/>\nAmericans would go unfulfilled. Say that a bright young parent sacrifices a<br/>\nrewarding career to stay at home and teach the children. When those children<br/>\ngrow up, would half of them (one parent from each married couple) also<br/>\nsacrifice their potential to stay home and teach their own children? If so,<br/>\nmuch of the result of home-schooling would be the creation of more<br/>\nhome-schooling parents for the next generation, and so on.<br/>\nMaybe home-schoolers can justify this loss. If so, please write. I believe<br/>\nthat home-schooling is a noble experiment done for the right reasons, and I<br/>\nhope to hear why it may prove to be a success.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd her week-later response:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids are doing and their<br/>\nhigh hopes for them, but almost no one addressed my concern that a large<br/>\npercentage of the kids would never use their educations if they became<br/>\nhome-schoolers themselves. Gifted violinists would never be heard in a<br/>\nconcert hall; great leaders would never be able to change society; brilliant<br/>\nscientists would never have a shot at curing cancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to home-school your sons<br/>\nand then watch them become home-schooling parents themselves instead of<br/>\nhaving careers? This is a serious philosophical issue: If you stay at home<br/>\nand teach your child rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his<br/>\nchild rocket science, and he stays at home and teaches his child rocket<br/>\nscience, when does anyone ever become a rocket scientist? In short,<br/>\nhome-schooling is easy to recommend for certain individuals, but hard to<br/>\nrecommend for society...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to have more of a social concern that homeschooling will draw<br/>\npeople out of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What ever<br/>\n&gt; happened to people liking what they do?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Has it ever been that way? In &quot;olden&quot; times men did what their fathers did<br/>\nor apprenticed with someone of the parents&#39; choosing. Even husbands were<br/>\noften chosen with an eye towards being a good provider. (Or increasing the<br/>\nbride&#39;s family&#39;s status ;-) Happiness was what you managed to make of it,<br/>\nnot a goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me that people have always been advised to follow the path of<br/>\nsecurity which translates into a stable job that pays well. It&#39;s just become<br/>\nmore streamlined these days with kids being handed lists of careers that<br/>\nwill need people in the next decade. (And there&#39;s probably an even greater<br/>\nsocial motive there too, trying to discourage kids from careers that are<br/>\nalready glutted.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as people talk about putting happiness first I think it&#39;s always<br/>\nbeen unadmittedly secondary to security. It&#39;s pretty hard for it to be<br/>\notherwise in a society that spends 12 years pounding home the idea of the<br/>\nneeding to spend childhood preparing for good careers as adults. Can you<br/>\nimagine schools asking kids what their dreams are and saying the school is<br/>\nthere to help them acheive them? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117801964,"authorName":"MO Milligans","from":"MO Milligans &lt;Ozarkren@...&gt;","profile":"trozark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hope I am not too far behind on  this...","postDate":"1033096528","msgId":44691,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMS4xLjYuMi4yMDAyMDkyNjIyMTExMi4wMDlmMTE2MEBlZGlzb24ucmlwaW50ZXJuZXQuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTI2LjE1MTcyOC4tMjEwNDkuMC5tZXBsdXNmaXZlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44686,"nextInTopic":44697,"prevInTime":44690,"nextInTime":44692,"topicId":44676,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... == My thoughts are that maybe they, the PS ers that went on to college, have an epiphany, and realize they have a choice to go or not, so they make other","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1482502017\">At 03:17 PM 9/26/02 -0500, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But I have met lots of public school kids burned out with<br/>\n&gt;school and life in general not having that gusto for learning.

I was<br/>\nreading a back newsletter from HEM. The topic for two months was a<br/>\nMarilyn vos Savant the Guiness Book of World Records smartest person I<br/>\nthink it said.<br/>\nWhen she was asked about homeschooling she felt that all of the<br/>\nhomeschooled children will fade into the sunset and become stay at home<br/>\nparents.Of course homeschooling their kids...as if that is a terrible<br/>\nthing. Maybe the kids loved it so much that they want to carry on the<br/>\nfun.*grin*<br/>\n I was amazed  at her logic...and wondered what you all thought of it.I<br/>\ncan&#39;t see how merely being in public school is going to guarantee my<br/>\nchild a better chance at &quot;success&quot;.The illusive word we keep hearing now<br/>\nthat we have teens! <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know of many homeschoolers that just stay home because they<br/>\nusually go on to jobs or other learning experiences.

My teens keep hearing that unless they get a degree they will<br/>\nnot &quot;succeed&quot; and will amount to nothing since they won&#39;t get a high<br/>\npaying job. Minimum wage is very feared it sounds like. What ever<br/>\nhappened to people liking what they do? Does ever teen choose a<br/>\nprofession based on money? I would much prefer my kids liking what they<br/>\ndo and living on less than doing something for the money and being<br/>\nunhappy. That sounds so much like half of the folks I meet in stores,<br/>\nshops and businesses.<br/>\n  thanks for listening,<br/>\nsharon<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\r<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\r<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
