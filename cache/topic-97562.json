One will often do the wrong thing if one does<br/>\nnot take guidance from spiritual knowledge, for in<br/>\nmany cases the materialistic idea will be the exact<br/>\nreverse of what is proper.  Excitable children should<br/>\nbe surrounded by and dressed in red or reddish-yellow<br/>\ncolors, while lethargic children should be surrounded<br/>\nby blue or blueish-green shades of color.  The<br/>\nimportant thing is the complementary color that is<br/>\ncreated within the child.  In the case of red it is<br/>\ngreen, and in the case of blue, orange-yellow.  This<br/>\ncan be seen very easily by looking for awile at a red<br/>\nor blue surface and then quickly looking at a white<br/>\nsurface.  The physical organs of the child create this<br/>\ncontrary or complementary color, and this is what<br/>\ncauses the corresponding organic structures that the<br/>\nchild needs.  If excitable children have a red color<br/>\naround them, they will inwardly create the opposite,<br/>\nthe green; and this activity of creating green has a<br/>\ncalming effect.  The organs assume a tendency of<br/>\ncalmness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow!  Be sure to try this:  &quot;This can be seen very<br/>\neasily by looking for awile at a red or blue surface<br/>\nand then quickly looking at a white surface.&quot;<br/>\n(Steiner, see above.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
