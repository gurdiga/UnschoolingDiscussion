I had written out a <br/>\ndetailed list of activities we&#39;d already done, and planned to do, as <br/>\nwell as my assessment reports.  But I took it back down to about 13 <br/>\npages of nothing more than the law, and the main page off the other <br/>\nsites. I figured if she wanted to know more she had the web address&#39;s <br/>\nand could look them up herself.  I also added a few articles, but did <br/>\nnot turn over anything directly related to our own activities, as I <br/>\nhad planned too in the beginning.  So basically all she got was web <br/>\npages that educated, but did not violate our privacy in itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that&#39;s OK, but I figure it would be best to try and educate <br/>\nher first, before I ended up having to educate some judge.  But she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get any of our records, and didn&#39;t view any of the kids work <br/>\nexcept a story mariah is working on, I showed her that basically more <br/>\nto brag than anything about how well she is learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99826381,"authorName":"Mary Bianco","from":"&quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;mummyone24@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"More than they deserve","postDate":"1032376680","msgId":44341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYxMTJpZXFYSXRNY3g0dnZzR08wMDAwMDM1NEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44345,"prevInTime":44340,"nextInTime":44342,"topicId":44341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it s real important for all homeschoolers to realize what the laws are in their own home state.

And I do mean exactly what they are. I also <br/>\nthink it&#39;s very important, like someone else said, not to give them more <br/>\nthan is necessary. That means what the law requires. NOT what someone just <br/>\nwants to know and is asking for. If you need to educate anyone asking in <br/>\nregard to the school system, then educate them on the law and nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had that here with some of our parents in my local support group. Many of <br/>\nus heard, &quot;well it&#39;s no big deal for me to&quot; or &quot;I like having it for me&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;well they seemed to appreciate my extra effort.&quot; This came from putting <br/>\ntogether portfolio&#39;s to when they sent in letters to other things. I <br/>\nunderstand that some want to keep more than requested for themselves and I <br/>\nunderstand how many think it&#39;s just easier to do what is asked of them. But <br/>\nin the long run, it will hurt us all. The more they get beyond what is law, <br/>\nthe more they ask for and come to expect. My support group tires to make it <br/>\nvery clear that it&#39;s not a matter of being difficult, it&#39;s a matter of what <br/>\nis right. Law is law and do just that. If not, I see that maybe all of us <br/>\nwill end up inundated with paper work and appointments that we don&#39;t want to <br/>\nhave.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44328,"nextTopicId":44343}}
