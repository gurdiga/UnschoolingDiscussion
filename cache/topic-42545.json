Thought the group might enjoy it.<br/>\nGinny<br/>\nDust if you must <br/>\n<br/>\nDust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better, <br/>\n<br/>\nTo paint a picture or write a letter, <br/>\n<br/>\nBake a cake or plant a seed, <br/>\n<br/>\nPonder the difference between want and need? <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nDust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time, <br/>\n<br/>\nWith rivers to swim and mountains to climb, <br/>\n<br/>\nMusic to hear and books to read, <br/>\n<br/>\nFriends to cherish and life to lead. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nDust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the sun in your eyes, the wind in your hair, <br/>\n<br/>\nA flutter of snow, a shower of rain. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis day will not come around again. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nDust if you must, but bear in mind, <br/>\n<br/>\nOld age will come and it&#39;s not kind. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you go and go you must, <br/>\n<br/>\nYou, yourself, will make more dust. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nA house becomes a home when you can write &quot;I love you&quot; on the furniture. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42465,"nextTopicId":42546}}
