They were downright mean and rude.  <br/>\nOthers ( including my own parents) told me that he needed to &quot;deal with it, <br/>\nget used to it, toughen up&quot;  etc etc.  My mom said.. &quot;there will always been <br/>\nmean people in the world, we just have to learn to live with it&quot;  Well, I did <br/>\nnot agree.  This was before I even found out about unschooling.   I knew in my <br/>\nheart that things are NOT just black and white.  We do NOT have to &quot;just deal <br/>\nwith it&quot;  or, rather, there is more than one way to &quot;deal with it&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n   Yes, we come in contact with rude and mean folks in our every day life.   <br/>\nA rude person at the store, a bully child in play group, a condescending <br/>\nwaiter, on and on and on.  We deal with them in an individual basis and take each <br/>\nsituation and try to find a solution.  Sometimes it&#39;s just ignoring the person. <br/>\n Sometimes it&#39;s countering back with kindness and understanding.  Sometimes <br/>\nit is assertively taking a stand and demanding better treatment.   But, the big <br/>\ndifference I see in these situations is, they are temporary.  We do not have <br/>\nto stay in a situation that involves rudeness day in and day out.     If a <br/>\ncashier at a particular store is rude every time I go in that store.. I will stop <br/>\nshopping there, or at least avoid her line.   There ARE solutions to dealing <br/>\nwith rudeness, and sometimes it means we take ourselves out of the situation.  <br/>\n Our time is too precious and our life too important to have to &quot;tolerate&quot; <br/>\nongoing rudeness from others in our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72602,"nextTopicId":72459}}
