You play against the computer,<br/>\n&gt;&gt; but while playing the computer talks to you and shows you options, but<br/>\n&gt;&gt; lets you choose the moves.  Then tells you why it was or was not a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; good idea.  My 9 yr son loves it and my 5 yr old daughter has begun<br/>\n&gt;&gt; playing as well.
