Dd (7) <br/>\ndecided strawberries with cream would be nice. My children had not <br/>\nyet met these 2 children that were coming over, they were very <br/>\nexcited.<br/>\n<br/>\nDropped oldest dd (15) at the libary, she came home with more books <br/>\nthen she could comfortably carry.  My sons (12 & 9) were playing <br/>\na card game all morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur new friends arrived, and it took about uhmmmm....2 seconds for <br/>\nthe children to feel comfortable with each other.  They were off and <br/>\nplaying, and the mother and I sat and had a cup of tea while the two <br/>\nyoung girls happily cut out snow flakes and played barbie, and turned <br/>\ncart-wheels while listening to N&#39;Sync.  My boys showed their new <br/>\nfriend a card game he did not know.  They had fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter our guest went home, my boys played some of their Monkey Island <br/>\ngame, it is full of problems and puzzles.  One son asked me what <br/>\nipecac is.  I told him, he understood.  He said it helped him figure <br/>\nout one of the puzzles, and he now knows how to spell it. Bonus!( <br/>\nI had to look it up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCut more snowflakes with dd, and then dinner.  After dinner, ds&#39;s <br/>\nwanted to look up on the internet, some of the cards they are <br/>\ncurrently  collecting.  We wondered why some are so different after <br/>\nthey are translated from Japanese to English, or more correctly <br/>\nAmerican. That was a fun conversation.  From looking up those cards <br/>\ntogether we ended up on many tangents, from greek mythology to celtic <br/>\nhistory.  It was very cool. More dots for us to make connections <br/>\nwith.  I think what they learned will be with them a long time, and <br/>\nno boring text book lesson was needed. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLater that night, because we had so much paper out for the <br/>\nsnowflakes, one son started folding it and the other son said *hey <br/>\ndon&#39;t we have a origami book around here....Yeah here it is.*  So <br/>\nthey made a boat, bug, T-rex, turtles and something else.  Then they <br/>\ngot into minitures, cutting the paper so small I really have no idea <br/>\nhow they were able to fold it. My youngest son, who never tried <br/>\norigami before really enjoyed it and he started out with some of the <br/>\nharder folds. I did not know he could do that.  I can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son (12) has asked me twice if we could look into a <br/>\ncomputer program that helps you learn Japanese.  You never know where <br/>\nthing can lead.....<br/>\n<br/>\nOver all it was a really great day full of living and learning.  I <br/>\ncould not have planned it any better, if I tried.  All I had to do <br/>\nwas be there and interested in them.  That is easy, I love them and <br/>\ndo not have to pretend to be interested ....ok.... sometimes I do <br/>\nhave to pretend, like when barbie or N&#39;Sync are the topic, but today <br/>\nshe had a friend over who was really interested in that stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83524433,"authorName":"callymom2000","from":"&quot;callymom2000&quot; &lt;scenichillhomeschool@...&gt;","profile":"callymom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"One day in a rich unschooling life...","postDate":"1018906117","msgId":34945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGE5ZmdtNSszcnZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34940,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":34944,"nextInTime":34946,"topicId":34940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First it was to the store to pick out some treats to enjoy with some new uschooling friends that were coming over for a visit.
