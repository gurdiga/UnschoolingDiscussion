Thought I&#39;d share too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Why do you un/home school?  I am a teacher by profession (actually I<br/>\n&gt;never<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;went beyond getting my degree and doing my student teaching) and what I<br/>\n&gt;saw<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the children experience in class made me realize that I would never <br/>\n&gt;want<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that experience for my child.  There are great teachers out there, but<br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;institution of school is not (in my opinion) healthy for kids.  I also<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;really enjoy spending time with him, learning together and having fun.<br/>\n&gt;We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;would miss out on so much if he was at school most of the day.  The <br/>\n&gt;other<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;part that concerns me is the peer experience, where his peers (mainly)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;be teaching him how to relate to others...I think a mix of ages is <br/>\n&gt;better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for teaching social skills.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What&#39;s your child&#39;s age?  I have one son, Nick, who is five.  He is<br/>\n&gt;really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;into anything having to do with space exploration.  Yesterday we had a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;time making a space buggy and star light-catcher.  He is also really <br/>\n&gt;into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;knights and swords.  He, like some of the other little boys descibed on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;list, is into Pajama Sam games, majicians and carrying special <br/>\n&gt;treasures<br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;his pockets!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Where do you live?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;We live in Olympia, Washington.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Are you satisfied with the HS laws in the state?  Yes.  As I understand<br/>\n&gt;it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Washington has some of the most liberal homeschooling laws.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Other information:  We attend, not as often as I would like, the<br/>\n&gt;Unitarian<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Universalist church in our area and really enjoy it.  I enjoy gardening<br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;knitting.  My husband works in the environmental field.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Looking foward to getting to know you!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Tiffany<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beMANY! has a new way to save big on your phone bill -- and keep on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saving more each month: Our huge buying group gives you Long Distance<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rates which fall monthly, plus an extra $60 in FREE calls!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/3821/7/_/448294/_/960608437/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/3821/7/_/448294/_/960608437/</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4669,"nextTopicId":9104}}
