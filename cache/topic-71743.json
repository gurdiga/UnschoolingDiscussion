I think that as<br/>\ncelebrities get older most of them get more circumspect than when they<br/>\nwere young and hungry for publicity to help their rise. It seems like<br/>\nmany of the celebs who are &quot;media shy&quot; have had a bad experience of<br/>\nbeing misquoted or manipulated in some early interview. Perhaps they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t realize how others saw them, and the &quot;truth&quot; as the reporter saw<br/>\nit, upset them. One responsibility that celebrities have is to be<br/>\ngracious to members of the public whenever possible. The old stars were<br/>\ntaught that I think, and accepted it as part of the territory. But<br/>\nreporters weren&#39;t climbing trees with zoom lenses in the same way<br/>\neither. (Well maybe Hedda Hopper figuratively speaking).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat responsibility celebrities have to the world in general, and the<br/>\nuse and abuse of access to the media, are some issues I have been<br/>\nthinking about a lot since the Gulf War began. I haven&#39;t any answer yet,<br/>\nand I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t a contestant in Miss America (or whatever pageant<br/>\nit was) recently when one of the questions was &quot;should celebrities use<br/>\ntheir status to speak out on political issues&quot;. I think this is a<br/>\nquestion that anyone who has access to the media will probably consider<br/>\n- even if vaguely, say along the lines of: &quot;What an idiot that guy is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue I have pondered for a long time, is how an artist&#39;s<br/>\npolitical stance and their private personality affects their work,<br/>\nwhether it is or should be relevant or not (Picasso&#39;s &quot;Guernica&quot; is not<br/>\nlessened just because he was a misogynist dickhead - or is it???)  This<br/>\nfirst came up for me when my enjoyment of Jane Austen  was severely<br/>\ncurtailed in 10th grade, by our English teacher giving us a lengthy<br/>\nexpose on the absence of the underclasses and lack of critique of social<br/>\ninequities in &quot;Persuasion&quot; and others. This brought up the question of<br/>\nwhether an artist always has the mandate to seek social change in their<br/>\nwork. It took me a few years after leaving school to get to back to<br/>\nenjoying Austen. I notice that many of the movie representations seek to<br/>\naddress this glaring problem in her work by having servants in the<br/>\nbackgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in college studying Creative Arts (what USA would call Fine<br/>\nArts) one of the topics lectured about was that &quot;Is All Art Political?&quot;<br/>\nI remember it was a bit circuitous - begging the question if Art is<br/>\nfirst defined as a political statement, as it was by some of the<br/>\nteachers. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 01, 2003 4:43 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] judgemental; celebrities and standards<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/1/2003 5:55:43 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\nUnschooling-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t believe that most celebrities think they are &quot;Gods&quot;.

According to an interview w/ Nicole<br/>\nKidman, she knew they were having problems, but she had been assured and she<br/>\nbelieved that the problems were not major. As a matter of fact - the<br/>\ninterior design for their newest home was - she thought - the biggest<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\nHe dumped her - in full view of the world.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand what you are saying. But again I would just like for people<br/>\nto see that there is so much more to people&#39;s lives that what we see. I&#39;ll<br/>\nget personal here to try and prove a point. My first marriage ended with me,<br/>\nafter 10 years saying I needed out. Just took off and moved to my moms and 6<br/>\nmonths later moved in with a younger guy. Looked pretty slimy because my ex<br/>\nwas lamenting about me leaving and taking his child and how much he loved me<br/>\nand we were his whole life. His family, my family and all our friends<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand why I did what I did. I was a pretty private person. I<br/>\nkept my problems to myself and the therapist. I was trying for 2 years to<br/>\nget him to go to counselling with me. And I do mean 2 years. I was begging<br/>\nfor him to realize we had a problem. He was not helpful, understanding,<br/>\nsupportive or respectful &quot;of me.&quot; To everyone else he was a great guy. He<br/>\nreally was. When I just didn&#39;t love him anymore after 2 exasperating years,<br/>\nI left. Everyone, absolutely everyone was shocked. We had such a perfect<br/>\nmarriage. To everyone else but us. I looked like the bad guy. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuntil years later and through therapy I realized I was abused. Not<br/>\nphysically, but getting hit would have been easier for me than what he was<br/>\ndoing. One just never knows what goes on behind closed doors. (didn&#39;t mean<br/>\nto sound like a CW song)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If a person is living in the public eye - they should behave accordingly.<br/>\nWould it have killed Tom Cruise to quietly talk w/ Nicole? Would it have<br/>\nkilled him to respect her? Couldn&#39;t he have used discretion and patience?<br/>\nDid he have to let her know long distance? Couldn&#39;t he have waited before<br/>\njumping into the limelight w/ Penelope Cruz? And her....look at her<br/>\nrecord...she&#39;s had an affair w/ most of her leading men? What does all of<br/>\nthis say about her?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that people in the public do have some responsibility to act<br/>\ndifferently in public. I&#39;ve heard public people even say the same thing. If<br/>\nthey can&#39;t handle it, then get out. I also believe that &quot;stars&quot; get paid<br/>\nridiculous amounts of money for what they do. I love a good actor and<br/>\nappreciate their ability. I could never do that. But a million dollars or<br/>\nmore for one movie? I think that&#39;s excessive. And I also think that goes<br/>\nhand in hand with what they think of themselves and how they act. But again,<br/>\nprivate lives and what and how they do it are something different. You use<br/>\nTom Cruise as an example. He probably could have been more respectful and<br/>\npatient. But again we don&#39;t know the whole story and maybe he just had<br/>\nenough and didn&#39;t know any other way to get out. Maybe he is just a<br/>\nslimeball, but we can&#39;t say either for sure unless we know him. And P. Cruz,<br/>\ndid she really have affairs with most of her leading men or just go out with<br/>\nthem or have her picture taken? Was she bedding them all? I don&#39;t see where<br/>\nstar public behavior really says a lot about them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] judgemental; celebrities and standards","postDate":"1054508489","msgId":71758,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYy4xNTk5YzU3NC4yYzBiZGZjOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71756,"nextInTopic":71759,"prevInTime":71757,"nextInTime":71759,"topicId":71743,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/1/03 2:53:47 PM, jana@coyotescorner.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1530285466\">In a message dated 6/1/03 2:53:47 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; What some of them can do IS pretty special.
