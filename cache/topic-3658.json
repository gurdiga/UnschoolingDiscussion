I was just loaned the book that I have only read bits and peices of,<br/>\njust to get an idea of a sample schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at our church, if the baby is constantly crying the parent is called and<br/>\ntakes the child!  I choose not to leave my babies in the nursery until they&#39;re<br/>\nabout 6 months old anyway.  And then I do it gradually, for short periods of<br/>\ntime, until they are comfortable being there.  My 2 yr old loved it right away,<br/>\nwhen she was a baby.  She loves playing with the &#39;babies&#39; at church.  In fact she<br/>\nasks everyday to go to church.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, with my now 3month old (yay, she&#39;s one month older, and growing so<br/>\nfast :-(), I usually miss the sermon altogether.  We stay in there for worship bc<br/>\nif she starts being fussy no one can hear. And in our church, worship is a real<br/>\nparty (dancing, jumping, shouting, etc., we&#39;re pentacostal, if you can&#39;t tell<br/>\n;-)) so I usually just dance around with her and she loves it!  But when the<br/>\nsermon starts, if she gets fussy I just walk out or stay in the back near the<br/>\ndoors for a quick exit.  She used to sleep right through but as she gets older<br/>\nshe&#39;s awake for longer periods of time.  And I truly feel there is nothing wrong<br/>\nwith that sacrifice, either!  And I can&#39;t think of a single person I know who<br/>\nwould!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving for Him,<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MORELFAM@...\">MORELFAM@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  another example is<br/>\n&gt; that my little guy doesnt like the nursery at church at this stage so we<br/>\n&gt; sacrifice a less disrupted service (since we are the mature adults) instead<br/>\n&gt; of having the baby be upset for that hour in the nursery (which i<br/>\n&gt; heartbreakingly see parents do every week!! :( )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i wonder if this is an example of child centered parenting that we discussed<br/>\n&gt; earlier?  is this something that ezzo program would look down on?  to us,<br/>\n&gt; sacrifice=love when done with that motivation.  just like the big one!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"MORELFAM@xxx.xxx","from":"MORELFAM@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"MgvxDXWHJ0oWyH4y_IoHNQbE9Jv7JL098jzf2bvJy6HuBi_DIFzekRpP8NAynb2x03kO3hW19w","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: practical examples of ap","postDate":"939410987","msgId":3658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDYuMzY1OC45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3666,"prevInTime":3657,"nextInTime":3659,"topicId":3658,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/7/99 2:58:28 PM, faithb@afes.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-471607417\">In a message dated 10/7/99 2:58:28 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:faithb@...\">faithb@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while, just <br/>\nyou and your husband, or was the baby always with you?

I know some <br/>\nof you have talked about keeping the baby in a sling on you, but I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine<br/>\nfor the sake of my back.  I don&#39;t have the greatest back as it is, and I <br/>\nwould think that it would make it worse.  I would love to hear what you, and <br/>\nanyone<br/>\nelse, have to say. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ni use the term attatchment parenting, but it is not synonymous with the image <br/>\nportrayed on 20/20 the other nite!  they said, among other things: <br/>\ncontroversial, simplistic, no strollers, and having the goal of nursing their <br/>\nchild as long as possible!  ha!  tho i have breastfed my babies up to 3 <br/>\nyears, i would certainly not state that as my goal!!  it was simply meeting <br/>\nthe needs of the child!  o well, i guess we already know not to get our best <br/>\ninfo from tv!  my local news show had a follow up piece afterward and did a <br/>\nmuch better job of presenting the reality imo.  that ap (attatchment <br/>\nparenting) is a choice that works for them, strengthening and supporting the <br/>\nlove in their families!  that the parents had thought about what they wanted <br/>\ntheir children to become (compassionate, loving, secure, etc), and that they <br/>\ncould easily see how ap was going to be the foundation. <br/>\n<br/>\nto answer your queries, faith.  i too couldnt imagine carrying my <br/>\nnot-only-big-at-birth-but-also-gaining-quickly babies every hour of the day.  <br/>\nso i am content to have them around.  i &quot;sling&quot; them sometimes, (esp when <br/>\nthey are fussy or sick, or i need to dash into the store w/a toddler in hand) <br/>\nand other times they are content just to know i am near and sensitive to <br/>\ntheir needs.  and about them falling asleep, one of the greatest things about <br/>\nthe sling (to me) is that they can be easily layed down by just leaning over <br/>\nthe bed and sliding them off!<br/>\n<br/>\nwe did take our babies everywhere pretty much.  and they usually did well bc <br/>\nwhen mom is near they have everything they need.  i found that the first few <br/>\nmonths usually fly by (okay, in retrospect anyway) and then by about 8-9mos i <br/>\ncould leave them w/ hubby for a few hours if i wanted.  and it extends from <br/>\nthere.  my 16mo old can have me gone for about 4-5hrs at a time for example <br/>\nw/out him being upset.  of course EACH CHILD is DIFFERENT.  it has been <br/>\neasier for us than for some because the kids have been pretty laid back.  i <br/>\nhave  friends who have the same age children as me and choose not to leave <br/>\nthem that long bc of the discomfort it causes the child.  another example is <br/>\nthat my little guy doesnt like the nursery at church at this stage so we <br/>\nsacrifice a less disrupted service (since we are the mature adults) instead <br/>\nof having the baby be upset for that hour in the nursery (which i <br/>\nheartbreakingly see parents do every week!! :( )<br/>\n<br/>\ni wonder if this is an example of child centered parenting that we discussed <br/>\nearlier?  is this something that ezzo program would look down on?  to us, <br/>\nsacrifice=love when done with that motivation.  just like the big one!  <br/>\n<br/>\nit is amazes me again and again that different people can see the very same <br/>\nthing and feel so differently about it!  oh the wonders of our uniqueness!<br/>\n<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3655,"nextTopicId":3669}}
