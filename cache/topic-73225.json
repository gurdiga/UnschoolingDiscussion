I have had migraines because<br/>\nof certain sounds that I couldn&#39;t escape.  Part of it is sensitive ears,<br/>\npart of it is my somewhat &quot;different&quot; neurology.  I will NOT acclimate to<br/>\ncertain sounds, I can&#39;t make my brain not react.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, I can wear the squishy ear plugs that filter, but don&#39;t block, the<br/>\nsound.  This lowers the level just enough that I can cope with MY issue<br/>\nwithout it impacting the people around me.  My children are older now and<br/>\nare somehow not as loud.  But when they were young, I had to make<br/>\nadjustments so that I could be kind.  Not that I didn&#39;t sometimes say,<br/>\nsweetly, &quot;Can that be less loud, please?&quot;  I would even say, &quot;I am finding<br/>\nthis same song/cartoon/ sound nerve wracking, can we play something else?&quot;,<br/>\nespecially when the same thing had been playing for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would say it calmly, and with kindness.  Everyone in a home has a<br/>\nright to be comfortable and happy, but not at the expense of someone else.<br/>\n We found balance by adjusting and compromise--mostly by the adults because<br/>\nchildren learning and being joyful is important and fleeting.<br/>\nchris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jan 9, 2014 at 5:23 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s true some sounds are irritating.<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t think if I can hear two broadcasts at once, like a radio station<br/>\n&gt; AND a TV show, or with two different pieces of music playing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In another discussion Meredith wrote to a sound-bothered mom:  &quot;Maybe in<br/>\n&gt; good weather, with the windows open, the sound won&#39;t trouble you so much.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe over time you&#39;ll get used to it...&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes a mom says she can&#39;t listen to cartoons or some such.
