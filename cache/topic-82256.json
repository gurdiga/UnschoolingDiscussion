It&#39;s a tangent I know, but I have to share this related <br/>\nstory --<br/>\n<br/>\n       The National Book Festival has been on BookTV and a book <br/>\nreviewer/author named Michael Dirda spoke about his new prize-winning book, which was all <br/>\nabout growing up poor in the heartland and becoming a passionate reader. In <br/>\nfact, how being a reader had become his whole identity. I think it&#39;s called &quot;An <br/>\nOpen Book&quot; - will look up later.<br/>\n<br/>\n       Anyway, he said money was so tight and his mother so frugal that she <br/>\ntaught them to only do school reports on things that started with the letter <br/>\n&quot;a&quot; -- she would always go for the introductory encyclopedia offers (Volume A <br/>\nfor 59 cents!) and then cancel before she had to pay $9.95 for any other <br/>\nvolumes. So he and his sisters had a whole  shelf full of reference sources at home, <br/>\nbut only on things that started with &quot;a&quot; like asteroids and artichokes and <br/>\nArgentina and Alabama and alligators. He said the teachers always gave them good <br/>\ngrades and never noticed. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n       Btw, his book sounded absolutely marvelous for anyone here who was <br/>\ninterested in the reading thread before -- this author was very much a self-made <br/>\nreader, with no role models or encouragement of any kind, it sounded like. He <br/>\nread exactly what he pleased, from comic books to Sherlock Holmes (and his <br/>\ndescription of reading the Hound of the Baskervilles for the first time was <br/>\ndelicious to a kindred reading spirit like me.)  JJ     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was very far from knowing anything about unschooling in those days, <br/>\n&gt; but I do remember, once, saying to her teacher - &quot;Kind of weird to <br/>\n&gt; &#39;authentically&#39; assess what is not authentically learned.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This was because my daughter had been assigned to learn about the <br/>\n&gt; kangaroo rat. All California 4th graders learn about California. So the <br/>\n&gt; class had been divided into groups - the desert, ocean, mountains, and <br/>\n&gt; valleys groups. She was in the desert group. Then, within the group <br/>\n&gt; they each got assigned an animal to learn about. She got the kangaroo <br/>\n&gt; rat. At the time, she was horse-crazy. She also was crazy about <br/>\n&gt; dolphins and whales and other creatures of the sea. She was NOT <br/>\n&gt; interested in kangaroo rats.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82235,"nextTopicId":82262}}
