You&#39;re right - my opinion of the medical fraternity <br/>\nis not high, a fact that puts me in a rather akward postion.  It was a doctor <br/>\nwho hurt my daughter, and now I&#39;m having to put my trust in other doctors to <br/>\nhelp her.  I know all doctors aren&#39;t the same, but if I had my way I&#39;d never <br/>\ndeal with another one.  My DH and I actually considered not going through <br/>\nwith Tess&#39;s surgery, mainly because of our doctor phobia.  Really, I&#39;m past <br/>\nmost of my anger now.  Most of the time I feel only blessed.  My life has <br/>\nbeen changed for the better through our suffering.  Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJodye</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7976,"nextTopicId":7863}}
