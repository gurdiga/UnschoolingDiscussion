My parents never said anything negative about<br/>\nanyone.  (for the most part)  And we weren&#39;t expected to say negative things<br/>\nabout people either.  Gossip was seen as very bad and I think that was a<br/>\ngood thing in many ways.    But it also crossed over that you really didn&#39;t<br/>\nfeel comfortable venting about anyone either or just talking about what<br/>\nhappened between you and a friend.  If you didn&#39;t feel comfortable talking<br/>\nabout things that happened between you and your friends, you also couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbring issues to the table to talk about how to work through them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have always wanted my kids to feel comfortable talking with me about<br/>\nanything.  But I do get tired of hearing them complain about people<br/>\nsometimes.  I know I am overly critical of it, in my mind, but I try to keep<br/>\nthose thoughts to myself.  The fear is that my children will grow up to be<br/>\nintolerant of people&#39;s differences, but that is not justified.  My kids are<br/>\nkind to other people and just vent their frustrations at home where they<br/>\nfeel safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did when the girls were littler that helped them talk about<br/>\nissues they have with other kids without my interpreting it for them, was to<br/>\nsay something that validated their feelings to them after their complaint.<br/>\nThat opened the door to them talking about it more without my judgment.<br/>\nUsually these topics came up in bed at night.  They might say something<br/>\nabout what a kid had done that was mean and I might say boy, that sounds<br/>\nfrustrating to deal with.  We might talk about how they responded that time<br/>\nand how they might respond differently next time if it didn&#39;t work well.<br/>\nActually, we still do this, but now they really vent how they felt and it&#39;s<br/>\nhard to hear sometimes.  I do try to focus on helping them solve the problem<br/>\nthough.  I want them to feel empowered and not victims of other people&#39;s<br/>\nbehavior.  <br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Talking about other people","postDate":"1125195363","msgId":108017,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlcjZwMytyNDdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":108021,"prevInTime":108016,"nextInTime":108018,"topicId":108017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is one of those areas where all I m sure of is that I want it to be different than how it was when I was a child...

When I was growing up, she shared lots of info about <br/>\npeople that I wasn&#39;t ready for and didn&#39;t ask for. I remember one <br/>\ntime when I was probably 7 or 8. We were headed to a party and she <br/>\ntold me, in regards to some people I probably wasn&#39;t going to even <br/>\ntalk to, that if anything came up about the woman&#39;s maiden name <br/>\nbeing the same as her married name, don&#39;t ask why, because she had <br/>\nmarried her first cousin. Too much info!<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember feeling so conflicted about my dad&#39;s family because I <br/>\nloved them so and yet heard all these terrible things about them. <br/>\nThey also gossiped a lot about each other and my mom had always <br/>\nsworn me to secret about everything she told me, so I felt weighted <br/>\ndown by all of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI Wanted To Do Things Differently long before I had kids, thought <br/>\nabout homeschooling, and learned about unschooling. Then my oldest <br/>\nson came along. He has never been shy about telling people what he <br/>\nthinks of them and their actions. From a 2 year old who would say &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want you to pick me up&quot; to a 4.5 yr old who started telling <br/>\nhis friends&#39; parents not to yell at their kids. (That&#39;s a whole <br/>\nother story...)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to start actually approaching my point, I&#39;ve just been <br/>\navoiding saying anything negative about people for a long time now! <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll repeat it to their face. And I don&#39;t want to burden <br/>\nhim with things he&#39;s not supposed to talk about to people&#39;s faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I feel like I&#39;m being less than honest with him. One of his <br/>\nfriends has been very angry lately. I didn&#39;t like how much this boy <br/>\nhas been yelling at other kids and had one of those &quot;is it just me <br/>\nor is C really angry a lot&quot; talks with another mom. Then C was over <br/>\nand yelled at my 2 yr old and tried to close the door on her. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t say anything about it to Mikey, but just didn&#39;t bring up the <br/>\nidea of playing with C much. Of course Mikey was well aware of how C <br/>\nwas acting and mentioned the other day about this noise C makes when <br/>\nhe&#39;s really angry. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m missing opportunities to talk about things because I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nhow to approach it and would love to hear how people without hang <br/>\nups actually talk. (Well, without hang-ups re this topic--don&#39;t want <br/>\nto limit the conversation too much!) Or how you&#39;ve dealt despite <br/>\nyour hang-ups...It&#39;s past time for me to get over this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\naj</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":107988,"nextTopicId":108047}}
