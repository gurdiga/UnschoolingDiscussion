ALL children?  all ages?<br/>\n    Wasn&#39;t it you who said TV is limited to weekends.  Well,  let me<br/>\nrespectfully disagree with you on setting this type of control.  I do not<br/>\nadvocate it.   In setting TV viewing apart from living...you give it a<br/>\nspecialness.  You risk sending some messages I imagine you do not intend to<br/>\nsend.  For instance,  perhaps a child will not engage in activities which<br/>\ntake place on the weekend,  because they&#39;d give up TV time.  Maybe they&#39;d be<br/>\nless likely to do anything BUT watch TV,  except during allowable times.<br/>\n    If you own a TV,  you must believe it has some value.  What about the<br/>\nupcoming Olympics...no viewing their favorite sports because of the day of<br/>\nthe week.  What about a show that comes on a Tuesday regarding... your<br/>\nchild&#39;s favorite animal?  What about world changing news....let&#39;s think<br/>\npositive here, :-),  perhaps a space mission,  peace treaty,  a friend<br/>\nmaking the news.<br/>\n    I understand issues of commercialism and materialism......my response to<br/>\nthat is,  provide videos with content you feel is appropraite. Young<br/>\nchildren do not usually understand the concept of commercial interruptions<br/>\n...my six yr old still asks if the show&#39;s over at commercial break...though<br/>\nit would make no sense to end the story there.  Videos are available at most<br/>\nlibraries to expand your collection inexpensively.  When they are old enough<br/>\nto wonder about commercial TV,  they are old enough to explore advertising<br/>\nissues like *truth* in advertising,   the purpose of advertising.  It can be<br/>\nquite valuable for a child to really want something from an<br/>\nadvertisement....get it,  and explore how different the reality is from the<br/>\nidea promoted in the ad.  Boy,  that&#39;s something I want my children to pick<br/>\nup on as soon as they are able.<br/>\n    To try to summarize,  if you put a TV in the child&#39;s<br/>\nplaying/seeking/learning environment,   I think they ough to be given the<br/>\nfreedon to use it.  Do you only allow puzzle solving on Tuesdays and<br/>\nThursdays?  &lt;sarcasm on&gt; And,  goodness gracious,  we do want them to read<br/>\nin moderation,  right?  I guess we better limit books to Mon-Wd-Fri,  in the<br/>\nafternoon. &lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I say these things respectfully, with the hope you&#39;ll see it from<br/>\nanother perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan.....been out for a few days with a nasty &#39;bug&#39;.....hope to catch up<br/>\nsoon!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30643,"nextTopicId":30679}}
