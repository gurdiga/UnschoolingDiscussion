At the same time I was  <br/>\nloving the Sex Pistols, the Breeders, and the Circle Jerks, I was  <br/>\nplaying Beethoven, Debussy, and Clementi in piano lessons, and loving  <br/>\nthat too, and playing piano for a school choir that did corny old  <br/>\nshow tunes (&quot;oh, what a beautiful moo-o-orning!&quot;). I could see the  <br/>\nbeauty in all these things. I still can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a young radical feminist, I never watched action movies  <br/>\nbecause I knew they were sexist, violent, evil, and so on. All my  <br/>\nteachers and role models had told me so. One night when I was about  <br/>\n22 I came home to my parents&#39; house after working a late shift at a  <br/>\nrestaurant. I was too wired to sleep, so I turned on the TV. The only  <br/>\nthing on was a late-night re-run of &quot;Die Hard.&quot; I watched it. I loved  <br/>\nit. It changed my life! Not only did I love action movies for years  <br/>\n(now I&#39;m swinging the other way and don&#39;t enjoy the realistic  <br/>\nviolence anymore), but I learned to stop judging things without  <br/>\nexposing myself to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time when I kept a blog I wrote about my days with punks:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.supenn.com/genius/000107.html\">http://www.supenn.com/genius/000107.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI live in a college town. Sometimes when I&#39;m down near campus I like  <br/>\nto watch the young men go by and wonder which one of them my son  <br/>\nmight grow up to be: The guy with the safety pin through his nose?  <br/>\nThe guy with the fraternity tattoo? The guy holding hands with the  <br/>\nother guy, god bless their queer little hearts? The guy with no  <br/>\nfashion sense and a book about the history of the vacuum tube? The  <br/>\none with the t-shirt that says, &quot;Come to MSU--it&#39;s a riot!&quot; with a  <br/>\npicture of a couch burning in the street? I am very fondly disposed  <br/>\ntowards them all.

So far that is true.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying not to get offended by this statement....trying really hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys LOVE some violent video games, hard-core music, some really <br/>\nscary movies, they adore witty, crass humor, they swear and their some <br/>\nof the most interesting, fun people I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they only watched things *I* thought weren&#39;t &quot;ugly&quot;, that would be <br/>\nlimiting their world. I&#39;ve learned to appreciate the intricacies of <br/>\ncrass humor, the very intelligent writing behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were surrounded by Enya, Mozart and Bach as young children...they <br/>\nlove Metallica, System of a Down and Disturbed.<br/>\nThey were surrounded with &quot;lovely&quot; food, made from scratch, super <br/>\nhealthy vegetarian and all...they love potato chips, soda and <br/>\ntwizzlers.<br/>\nThey were surrounded by little or NO television, and only PBS or <br/>\nother &quot;quality&quot; kids shows...they love Futurama, Family Guy and movies <br/>\nlike The Grudge.<br/>\nThey were surrounded by very little cussing (their Dad doesn&#39;t cuss at <br/>\nall, I used a few words, very rarely) and Trevor tends to use some <br/>\npretty colorful language...though he does know when to put it on <br/>\nhold.:)  He walked outside today and came back in saying &quot;It&#39;s FECKING <br/>\ncold out there!!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nSo....I don&#39;t know what your version of &quot;ugly&quot; is, but I have a <br/>\nfeeling some of our tastes are in that category.<br/>\nTo me, &quot;ugly&quot; is how people treat each other, not their musical <br/>\ntastes, use of swear words or what they watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my boys were mean to me, or hurtful to their family, that would <br/>\nfall under &quot;ugly&quot;.<br/>\nThey are kind and condiderate human beings for the most part (I&#39;d love <br/>\ntheir dishes to find the sink one day...but that&#39;s another issue) and <br/>\nwe all like being around each other.  I guess my definition of &quot;ugly&quot; <br/>\nis just different.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110557,"nextTopicId":110564}}
