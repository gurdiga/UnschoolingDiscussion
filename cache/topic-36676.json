I have seen kids at this age.  <br/>\nThey begin to pee or poop and they get some strange look over thier face..  <br/>\nLike, &quot;oh, oh, something is happening here!&quot;  The third stage is when they <br/>\nknow they are going to do it.  &quot;Oh, I feel like I need to pee/poop!&quot;.  At <br/>\nfirst, they may have the urge to eliminate, feel the urge, but not know quiet <br/>\nwhat it is, but eventually, they figure it out.. lol<br/>\n<br/>\n  Every child is different, there is no set age when children go through <br/>\nthese stages, and no set time that each phase lasts til the next phase comes <br/>\nin.
