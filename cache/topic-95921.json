(He was about 3 1/2) She yelled and screamed at him and made <br/>\na huge deal about it being a &quot;new&quot; couch! I was very upset-especially that <br/>\nshe felt that a stupid couch was more important than her grandson! We ended up <br/>\nhaving to take him to the emergency room the next afternoon-he had a bladder <br/>\ninfection! Did she ever appologise for her behavoir? Nope. And she still has <br/>\nthis &quot;thing&quot; for her couch-now 3 years old-how he can&#39;t put his feet on it, sit <br/>\nsideways on it, bounce (even gently) on it, etc.<br/>\nHe only had one or 2 accidents after the couch episode, and has always been <br/>\nhorrified and embarrassed (I&#39;m not sure exactly what my mother said to him, as <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t there), and we have always tried to gently reassure him that everyone <br/>\nhas accidents and that it is OK to have accidents-I don&#39;t think he really <br/>\nbelieved us... Until one day I had a full bladder and sneezed-and had a little <br/>\naccident of my own! I made sure he was aware of it, and went about cleaning up <br/>\nwithout &quot;beating myself up&quot; over it-just &quot;took care of business&quot; while I <br/>\nreminded him that I had told him that EVERYONE has accidents at least once in their <br/>\nlives. He studied me for several minutes and has never had an accident since <br/>\nthen, but I&#39;ve also never seen another time where he&#39;s felt ashamed about <br/>\nanything, so I&#39;m hoping he feels that he shouldn&#39;t be ashamed for an accident. <br/>\nNeat thread!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSang<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":161002657,"authorName":"AM Brown","from":"&quot;AM Brown&quot; &lt;ambdkf@...&gt;","profile":"ambdkf92","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Potty &quot;Training&quot;","postDate":"1088444449","msgId":95970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMC0yMjAwNDYxMjgxNzQwNDk0MjRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":95969,"nextInTopic":95973,"prevInTime":95969,"nextInTime":95971,"topicId":95921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Diaper Free is a book by Ingrid Bauer.

I could go back to school and take it, but to what end?  Why should potty training be any different?  How is a child that pottys at 3 1/2 less good or worthy than a child who manages at 18 mos?  It just makes them different, and different is good.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo! Mail Address AutoComplete - You start.

As hard as it was sometimes to deal with her being in diapers (read &quot;inconvenient&quot; to me...), and as hard as it was to deal with the nosy and annoying opinions of those who said &quot;my child was potty trained at 9 months&quot; etc...  I decided it just wasn&#39;t worth it.  So I quit the hassle, enjoyed the time spent changing and diapering her as our time, took hope at the times she tried the potty on her own, and when one day she magicly decided she was done with diapers I rejoiced in her decision.  It was so much more easier and less stressful than trying to force her - also, her personality is such that the more you push your wants the less she will respond.  She was 3 1/2 before she was completely out of diapers.  Due to some genetic and medical problems she had trouble with bedwetting until she was 5ish, but that couldn&#39;t be helped by her.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOffer the potty as a choice, but if he refuses go with it.  He&#39;ll do it when he is completely ready.  Also, be prepared for all the advice and &quot;my child&quot;s you are bound to get from friends, family, and complete strangers.... LOL.  I don&#39;t know about you, but a lot of times I just found it simple to smile and nod and keep doing what I was doing anyways.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlicia<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy and Chris &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:canderson51@...\">canderson51@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nI hope this is OK to post to the list--I would really value your input!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 2.5 yrs. and using diapers.

He agreed and that was that.  We had a <br/>\nfew accidents and I just changed his pants and we went on with life, <br/>\nno punishment or anger.  We did go through a short period where he <br/>\nwould wet his pants on purpose because he was in the middle of a <br/>\ncomputer game and didn&#39;t want to stop, that was a little tougher, but <br/>\nluckily a short stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell everyone he trained himself, I just gave him the time to <br/>\ndecide he was ready.  It was all amazingly painless.  I see friends <br/>\nstruggling with complicated training plans and just don&#39;t get it.  I <br/>\nusually advise that if they wait it will all be much easier.

I mean her life was really disrupted. Yet she started sitting on it<br/>\nevery day after we put her swimsuit on to go to the pool. I had bought it<br/>\nwhen we got to Texas from home in CA, just to have it available. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we got back home, I kept the potty available to her, in the room where<br/>\nwe were playing, and asked her if she wanted to be without pants. The potty<br/>\nslowly moved to the hallway, then the bathroom, then we had a child seat for<br/>\nthe main commode. She was so proud of herself, and there was no separation<br/>\nbetween pee-pee readiness and pooping readiness if YKWIM. She would loudly<br/>\nannounce, &quot;I have a poopoo in my butt&quot; before running to her potty.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing dry overnight took longer, and I bought a couple of washable &<br/>\nreusable underpads for my side of the bed for when she was willing to sleep<br/>\nwithout a diaper. (We used cloth) For a while she would wait until morning<br/>\nto pee in her diaper then say she was wet. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of almost a year she went from 60 diapers a week, to never<br/>\nwetting the bed, or having any accidents - utterly painlessly. Considering<br/>\nthe astonishing size of the poops she began making around the age of 3, I<br/>\nhave never been so grateful for anything in my life!

My first son who is now 6.5 started going once <br/>\nin a blue moon about age 18 months and we were under pressure to &quot;train&quot; him <br/>\nbecause at the time he was in daycare/preschool.  Well, I let him wear his <br/>\ndiapers as long as he wanted (I also knew I&#39;d be pulling him out and staying home <br/>\nbefore he got to that class) and from out of nowhere on his 3rd B-Day he said <br/>\n&quot;I done with diapers, MAMA&quot; and he has NEVER had an accident.  He just did it <br/>\none day.  I have no idea if this behavior is unique but I never had an inkling <br/>\nto &quot;train&quot; him.  We bought underpants and let him know that he could use them <br/>\nanytime but he couldn&#39;t pee or poop in them, like in a diaper and he never <br/>\ndid.  They were in his drawer for a long time and when he was ready he asked for <br/>\nthem.  We also NEVER used a potty.  He would just get up on his tippy toes and <br/>\npee or we would use a toddler toilet seat cover for poops, so he wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nfall through.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are doing the same with our second boy who will be 3 in August.  No little <br/>\npotty and he goes when he wants. He uses his cloth diapers just like his big <br/>\nbrother and we have never used training pants or pull-ups or whatever.  It <br/>\nworked the first time and only time will tell if it works this time.  I truly <br/>\nbelieve they just get to the point when they don&#39;t want to be bothered by a <br/>\ndiaper change and just do it by example of other&#39;s in the home and a little <br/>\nencouragement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI worked in child care for over 13 years and a large bunch of those little <br/>\ndarlings had accidents and were discouraged by training.  It was either too <br/>\nearly or they were pushed very hard (punished) by the teachers or parents.  The <br/>\nfew parent&#39;s I had that weren&#39;t in to rushing their kids and were open to <br/>\nletting them stay in diapers were happy to see better results.  My director gave me <br/>\na lot of slack on the rules and I had far less accidents with those kids once <br/>\nthey did start going to the bathroom on their own.   Don&#39;t rush him, just let <br/>\nhim take his time.  Neither of you needs the pressure, just whoop it up when <br/>\nhe goes and move on if he doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":73238415,"authorName":"J.
