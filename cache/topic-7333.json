They are 9 and 10. My daughter was <br/>\nscared to death, even cried before the show. (they are clowns) They have been <br/>\ntraining the last year with a professional clown. I was not going to force <br/>\nher to do the show, but I just behave calmly, like nerves are a part of <br/>\nperforming, which they are. Her brother was ready to go on and would have <br/>\nbeen crushed had she decided not to. Plus, I knew she would have been <br/>\ndisappointed in herself if she hadn&#39;t. Well, they did it and the Triumphed! <br/>\n(it wasn&#39;t a competition) But they were flawless... I was so proud of both of <br/>\nthem, but to be afraid like that then with a lift of the chin, do it <br/>\nbeautifully! <br/>\n<br/>\nThen today, I got up early to write and by 11 I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. I <br/>\nwent to bed and left the instructions that they could work on any type of <br/>\nproject they liked but had to clean the mess and no TV. I wondered briefly <br/>\nwhat kind of shape the house would be in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI woke to the smell of Chocolate chip cookies. Upon sleepy investigation, I <br/>\nrealized that they had not only baked the cookies(perfectly) but had cleaned <br/>\nthe mess and the living room! WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so proud of them, they used problem solving skills, cooperation, <br/>\nreading, math, and basic living skills, all without a single worksheet nor <br/>\nany direction or cohersion from me:) LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nTooo cooool!<br/>\nTeri<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nTeri Brown<br/>\nSuite101 Unschooling Editor <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling\">http://www.suite101.com/welcome.cfm/unschooling</a><br/>\nAssistant Editor For Voices, <br/>\nThe Journal of the National Home Education Network www.nhen.org<br/>\nColumnist For The Link: A Homeschooling Newspaper<br/>\nHomeschooling - Christian Unschooling - Natural learning<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/\">http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/</a><br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7338,"nextTopicId":7348}}
