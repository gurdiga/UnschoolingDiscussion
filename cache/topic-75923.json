The freedom to wander, explore, create, and<br/>\nrest on our own timetables. Unschooling, like no other approach,<br/>\nsells these opportunities in spades.<br/>\nThe picture of unschooling, as drawn by any number of authors and<br/>\nonline purveyors of the practice, is surely a pretty one. After no<br/>\nsmall amount of study, I was left with a vision of the<br/>\npicture-perfect family. My own. In perfect harmony. Learning without<br/>\ntrying, succeeding without sweat. If I were to pursue marketing as a<br/>\nvocation, and homeschoolers as my target population, I would be<br/>\npeddling unschooling. Everyone loves a product that sells itself.<br/>\nThe way I&#39;ve come to see it, if homeschooling is like jumping off a<br/>\ncliff into the great unknown, then a structured approach can be<br/>\nlikened to diligently getting that net up to break the fall.<br/>\nUnschooling is more like enjoying the ride down.<br/>\nThe thing is, I don&#39;t want to die.<br/>\nThe tethers of unschooling can be too long for comfort, although I am<br/>\ncertainly not in it for the comfort. I have thought more about this,<br/>\nnow that my kids are getting older, and my commitment to<br/>\nhomeschooling has grown from an attractive idea to a lifestyle. I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad to look at who I am, and how close I really am to this perfect<br/>\nunschooling guy I&#39;ve had dancing around my imagination since the idea<br/>\nfirst took hold.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think when Holt formulated the unschooling approach, he ever<br/>\nreally planned on it appealing to individuals with type A<br/>\npersonalities. I am sure it was assumed that those who have trust and<br/>\ncontrol issues, and are prone to nervous disorders, would be<br/>\nattracted to school-in-a-box approaches. With a multitude of self<br/>\nassessment tests available, and, if you pay for it, education<br/>\n&quot;professionals&quot; available for consultation via phone, email or fax<br/>\nanytime, it doesn&#39;t make sense that these people would even consider<br/>\nthe unschooling approach.<br/>\nAnd yet, here I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ Brad Beckerman in the July/August issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the rest of this article, as well as some other articles<br/>\nand columns from the current HEM at the address above, but you&#39;ll<br/>\nhave to get the magazine--the one you hold in your hands--to read<br/>\nthem all!

It&#39;s a mercury head<br/>\ncoin that I received as payment for a cup of lemonade I sold from my<br/>\nsidewalk stand. Our elderly neighbor, Mr. Landry, was my first<br/>\ncustomer on that hot summer day about 35 years ago. I was proud that<br/>\nmy lemonade was made with real lemon juice and was refreshingly cold,<br/>\nand my neighbor&#39;s response to it told me I had made the right choice.<br/>\n\tEntrepreneurship is a fantastic way for children to learn<br/>\nbroad lessons. Becoming a successful young businessperson includes<br/>\nnot just understanding money and budgeting, it also consists of<br/>\ndeveloping concern for quality, creating a market, learning to sell<br/>\nyourself and your product, communication skills, and the ability to<br/>\nstick to the task. It may even involve creating a partnership or<br/>\nhiring others, and the wider issues that come with those.<br/>\n&quot;Young Entrepreneurs&quot; were featured at Virginia Home Education<br/>\nAssociation&#39;s Conference and Curriculum Fair, and it was wonderful to<br/>\nsee the children&#39;s ideas and products. Some of the offerings were<br/>\nhand painted items, herb plants started from seed, pet treats, and,<br/>\nmost imaginatively, a board game that teaches the legislative process<br/>\nin our state. So impressed was I by these children and their<br/>\nentrepreneurial spirit that I invited young businesspeople in my area<br/>\nto present their wares at our local Not Back to School Picnic and<br/>\nCurriculum Swap/Sale last fall.<br/>\nMaybe some of the products weren&#39;t the highest quality, but the kids<br/>\nwere still learning, and their selling methods endearing, so I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stop myself from buying from them with some of the cash I&#39;d<br/>\nmade from selling my unneeded supplies. The transparent glycerin<br/>\nsoaps with bugs inside were too fun to pass up, and I was sure my<br/>\nfriend&#39;s dog would enjoy a pack of those handmade peanutbutter dog<br/>\nbiscuits.<br/>\nI clearly remember selling my first cup of lemonade-an event that<br/>\noccurred over 3 decades ago-which means that interaction was<br/>\nsignificant in my life. As an adult, I vowed to never pass up a<br/>\nchild&#39;s lemonade stand. Indeed, my children were startled when,<br/>\npassing a stand on a lonely country road two summers ago, I turned<br/>\nthe car around and bought 3 glasses from the two little children<br/>\nbehind the table. Their product was...well, made with one of those<br/>\ninsipid mixes I can&#39;t stand. So, while I still do not pass up a<br/>\nlemonade stand, I ask about ingredients before I buy more than one<br/>\nglass. And if the answer isn&#39;t &quot;lemon juice, sugar and water,&quot; I will<br/>\ngive them my tip for success.<br/>\n<br/>\n   -Shay<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are surprisingly few resources for kid-run businesses on the<br/>\nWeb, but here are the best I found:<br/>\n<br/>\nTips on Preparing Your Lemonade Stand Business<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.teachingkidsbusiness.com/lemonade-stand-tips.htm\">http://www.teachingkidsbusiness.com/lemonade-stand-tips.htm</a><br/>\nComplete ABCs on lemonade stand businesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Can Elementary School Age Kids Do to Earn Money & Learn Business<br/>\nin Summer?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&id=205225\">http://answers.google.com/answers/main?cmd=threadview&id=205225</a><br/>\nScroll down about 1/3 of the way to &quot;WORK FOR MONEY  (10-14 yr olds)&quot;<br/>\nfor some ideas on kid-run businesses.
