I means lighten up, and arrange a house in which <br/>\nthey can find something to eat.  Don&#39;t put food right in front of them and say <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t touch it until 5:00&quot; or &quot;This is for me, and you can&#39;t even taste it, <br/>\never.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith bedtimes, it&#39;s not &quot;How about you try to stay up until the sun rises?  <br/>\nI&#39;m going to bed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith movies, it&#39;s not &quot;You&#39;re too young for this whole shelf of movies, so <br/>\nnever touch them.&quot;  It&#39;s give them lots of choices among things you know they <br/>\nwould like.  And watch them with them.  And if they hate Sesame Street (which <br/>\nHolly did, until she was 9 or so), don&#39;t push it.   Once she started liking <br/>\nSesame Street she wanted to know all about the history of the show, and will still <br/>\nwatch old tapes, listen to cassette tapes from the 70&#39;s, wants to learn all <br/>\nthe harmonies of &quot;One Little Star&quot; from Follow that Bird...   Immersion.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe watched Stand By Me the other day.  When she was little and said &quot;I hate <br/>\nBig Bird,&quot; she used to watch Stand By Me.  It&#39;s based on a Stephen King story, <br/>\nit&#39;s got &#39;big boys,&#39; fear, death...    It&#39;s probably the favorite movie of <br/>\nher whole life.   The other day she said, &quot;I just got this part,&quot; about <br/>\nsomething, and she asked me what &quot;stormed the beach at Normandy&quot; meant.  She had <br/>\npaused it that day and said &quot;What does he mean by this?&quot; It was the voiceover <br/>\ncommenting that the dog had taught him the diffence between myth and reality (don&#39;t <br/>\nknow the exact quote).  I started talking to her about myth and she said, <br/>\n&quot;No, I know what myth means, but why did he say that?&quot;  So she ran it back and I <br/>\npointed out that their belief that the dog was told to &#39;sic balls&#39; was just <br/>\nmyth.  All the dog wanted was for them to get out of the fence, because as soon <br/>\nas he was on one side the dog on the other, the dog lay down happily and just <br/>\nlooked at him.   So it was a visual indication, not words.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could&#39;ve told her nine years ago that that movie was not good for a little <br/>\ngirl.  But that movie has been very good for her.   And for me?  A young, <br/>\nposturing Keifer Sutherland, every time she watches it. &lt;g&gt;  If she doesn&#39;t fully <br/>\nappreciate that part of the show, she might in a few more years.   It&#39;s <br/>\nsomewhat like sex without the presence of bed, couch or female.  But if she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nget it, she doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.

I have been looking for<br/>\nan outlet to discuss issues with this younger age<br/>\ngroup and have found it challenging.<br/>\n============<br/>\n<br/>\nJennefer,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 7, 5 and 4. I know Robyn&#39;s Jane is young, too, maybe 3? <br/>\nThere are a couple of us, at least, who are active here with young <br/>\nchildren. The wonderful thing about coming to unschooling is that you <br/>\ncan gradually lift certain controls as they become appropriate, as with <br/>\nmovies and tv. Right now, work on saying yes more, work on finding ways <br/>\nto say yes if the initial response needs to be no.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven very young children can decide when they are hungry and tired. When <br/>\nmine were younger, they had free access to a snack cart filled with food <br/>\nthey could freely choose. Yes, these choices were limited to healthy <br/>\nchoices--pretzels, graham crackers, animal crackers were the closest <br/>\nthing to cookies in there. In the refridgerator on the lowest shelf I <br/>\nhad cubed fruit and sliced veggies and cheese slices. I had read quite a <br/>\nbit of Monetssori philosophy when my oldest was about 2, out of which I <br/>\ntook the idea that children really wanted to use real tools, not fake or <br/>\npretend tools, that children took pride in caring for their own things, <br/>\nthat the space needed to be set up at child level and made child size <br/>\nwhenever possible. This approach made a huge difference in our lives--my <br/>\ngirls, especially, really responded to this. It gave them a tremendous <br/>\namount of control over themselves and their environment and paved the <br/>\nway for unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with bedtimes. Even when we had a bedtime routine--bath, <br/>\nstory, snuggles--the children were never told to get in bed and shut <br/>\ntheir eyes. They were always welcome to play quietly in their rooms <br/>\nuntil they felt ready to go to sleep, and my girls have always shared a <br/>\nroom, so there was plenty of playing. They are 17 months apart, and for <br/>\na long time Julia (5 now) would fall asleep around 9:00 and Emily would <br/>\ncontinue playing until 10:30 or so. It wasn&#39;t a very difficult step to <br/>\nsay to tell them they were welcome to play quietly downstairs until they <br/>\nwere ready to fall asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think lots of unschooling with younger children can happen quite <br/>\nnaturally as they grow. You&#39;re coming to unschooling at a perfect time. <br/>\nTake it gradually, and try to not to feel like you have to do it all at <br/>\nonce like flipping a switch. Work on finding more ways to say yes, more <br/>\nways for your children to control their own environment and you will <br/>\nbegin to see all the wonderful aspects of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\nIf anyone can point me in a direction where I<br/>\ncan get more insight on the younger age group, that<br/>\nwould be great.<br/>\n================<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find my website helpful <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a> Also, once the <br/>\nunschooling.com boards are back up and running, there is a file there <br/>\nfor preschool topics.

It<br/>\nseems like there are some &#39;unschooling&#39; families with<br/>\nyoung children &#39;preschool&#39; age or younger (3 years old<br/>\nhere) who only selectively let there children watch TV<br/>\nor videos.<br/>\n===================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&gt;This hasn&#39;t always been the case for us, as I touched on a bit in my <br/>\ntv post. For a long time we didn&#39;t have tv. When the kids were really <br/>\nyoung--when my oldest was 3 or under--I limited the amount of time they <br/>\nwatched videos to an hour or under a day. By the time she was 4, though, <br/>\nshe had free access to the videos and could pop them in when she wanted, <br/>\nthough that was still pretty controlled and limited by what we had in <br/>\nthe house. I remember lots of Teletubbies, Dragon Tales, Bear in the Big <br/>\nBlue House, Masie, countless Disney movies. We have a *huge* video <br/>\ncollection because of those years without tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started reading here (a year ago in November, I think), I <br/>\nbegan rethinking my approach to tv (and bedtimes and food). We had <br/>\ngotten cable several months before, so the kids (6, 4 and 3 at that <br/>\npoint) were watching tv as well as videos, though still more often <br/>\nvideos. I remember I had been wondering for a while when it would be <br/>\n&quot;okay&quot; to let my kids watch Star Wars, which I couldn&#39;t wait to share <br/>\nwith them because it&#39;s such an interest for dh and I. Emily had seen <br/>\nbits and pieces of the Phantom Menace, the parts that weren&#39;t too scary, <br/>\nbut it was still something that dh and I watched after the kids went to <br/>\nbed. For us, that&#39;s how it started--with Star Wars. After Star Wars, we <br/>\nbegan watching other things as well. It was gradual, not an <br/>\nin-your-face-violence kind of thing. Em had also seen parts of Lord of <br/>\nthe Rings, so we were soon sharing that with her as well. At first, she <br/>\ngot really upset by the dead dwarves in the mines and stopped watching. <br/>\nIt took her several months before she was comfortable trying again. Same <br/>\nthing with Spiderman--it was just too realistic when we first rented it, <br/>\nmaybe 6 months ago so we turned it off. We tried again a couple of weeks <br/>\nago, and they loved it--even the 4 year old. (A friend of mine has <br/>\ngotten quite a bit of grief from her 8 year old because he&#39;s not allowed <br/>\nto watch it but knows that Sam has.) We&#39;ve shared lots of really great <br/>\nmovies over the past year, but we still enjoy watching Disney movies, <br/>\ncartoons or whatever. We&#39;ve watched all the Star Wars, Lord of the <br/>\nRings, Indiana Jones, Men in Black, X-Men. We&#39;ve also watched Crouching <br/>\nTiger, Hidden Dragon; The Last Samurai; Sound of Music; Peter Pan; Harry <br/>\nPotter and many others.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, this has been gradual. The kids probably don&#39;t even <br/>\nremember not having free choice because it went from being very young to <br/>\nfree choice of videos to free choice of tv and movies. But, that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmean that they watch whatever they want without any parental input or <br/>\npresence. Emily watched the Last Samurai in our bed with us, and she <br/>\nwatched me sob at the end when the Samurai get massacred. We talked <br/>\nabout *why* I was crying so hard and what it meant to me to watch that. <br/>\nThey haven&#39;t seen The Matrix yet, but they haven&#39;t asked to see it <br/>\neither.  When Dh rented Kill Bill, we told the kids that it was an adult <br/>\nmovie, same thing with Fight Club. There are movies that I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthey need to see, and, yes, I&#39;m the one making that decision.. Kill Bill <br/>\nwas a movie I don&#39;t think *I* needed to see! We watch those movies in <br/>\nour room with the door closed. In the past we would have watched <br/>\nsomething like that after they went to bed, but because our kids no <br/>\nlonger have a bedtime, they&#39;re still awake. We just point that out and <br/>\nremind them that they&#39;re free to watch something else downstairs, play <br/>\nthe computer, play in the playroom, any number of other things, and <br/>\nthey&#39;re fine with that because it doesn&#39;t happen very often. They <br/>\nrealize that we&#39;re not telling them no just for the sake of controlling <br/>\nbut because it&#39;s something that is genuinely too much for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gradual part is really important, I think. Several months ago, I <br/>\nmade an analogy to someone who was throwing off controls left and right <br/>\nand whose children didn&#39;t quite know what to do with the new freedom. I <br/>\nsuggested that it might be a lot like being in a closet and having <br/>\nsomeone suddenly fling the door open wide, letting flood in the very <br/>\nbright light outside and how much that must hurt their eyes!  It&#39;s not <br/>\nabout flinging the door open as quickly as you can just because it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen closed for so long; it&#39;s more about gradually opening the door, <br/>\nusing your children&#39;s comfort levels to guide you. Like several of the <br/>\nexperienced folks here often say, it&#39;s not about never saying no but <br/>\nabout saying yes more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Age Appropriateness...","postDate":"1092828399","msgId":98294,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJENDhCNTJGLjJBMzU4JWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODE3MTgxMDI1LjQ0OTQ5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjExMzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":98291,"nextInTopic":98306,"prevInTime":98293,"nextInTime":98295,"topicId":98288,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(I&#39;m recalling<br/>\nwe stopped watching ER about that time.) Before that if it wasn&#39;t a cartoon<br/>\nor an animal or something she wanted to see, it didn&#39;t hold her attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Kat was 5 maybe when she started watching Xena which had a fair<br/>\namount of violence in it. But she&#39;s always been drawn to anything funny so<br/>\nshe avoided the more violent ones because they were also more serious.

They<br/>\nhave been helpful if not insightful.  Just to clarify,<br/>\nI offered up The Sopranos and The Lord of The Rings<br/>\nonly as examples; there are others, and the issue<br/>\nwasn&#39;t meant to only separate out these two films.  We<br/>\ndo not, by the way, watch these or these type of films<br/>\naround our children (ages 3 and 1).  We watch them<br/>\nwhen they are either napping or asleep for the night,<br/>\nor once in a while we actually get to go out on a date<br/>\nto the movies without the kiddos.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, our opportunities to watch these &#39;adult&#39; films<br/>\nare getting fewer, so we are wondering 1. what films<br/>\ncan we now watch with our children in the room and 2.<br/>\nWhen can we watch certain types of films with our<br/>\nchildren in the room (whether it&#39;s what age, or what<br/>\ndevelopmental stage they&#39;re at).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to accept that all unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy is applicable to all children of all ages. <br/>\nI feel like some unschooling philosophy is appropriate<br/>\nfor older children and not for younger.  and in my<br/>\ncase, younger means 3 not 9.  I have been looking for<br/>\nan outlet to discuss issues with this younger age<br/>\ngroup and have found it challenging.  Although I have<br/>\ngained a wealth of knowledge from this group, and<br/>\nalthough I know some families on this group have<br/>\nchildren around my childrens&#39; ages, it seems like the<br/>\nmajority of the discussion is geared toward the older<br/>\nchild.  Which is fine, but I could use more discussion<br/>\ntoward the very young child.  I checked out a group<br/>\ncalled preunschooling, and left it because it was not<br/>\nvery helpful as the people on it didn&#39;t really have a<br/>\ngenuine clue as to what unschooling really was as they<br/>\ndiscussed cirriculum and daycare/preschool quite a<br/>\nbit!?  If anyone can point me in a direction where I<br/>\ncan get more insight on the younger age group, that<br/>\nwould be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that there are some stages in early life that<br/>\nlittle kids don&#39;t need to know about much.  I believe<br/>\nSandra Dodd posted a comment to this effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough posted under a different thread, and although<br/>\nit seems to contradict her earlier comment about<br/>\n&quot;Innocence being ignorance dressed in a frilly dress&quot;,<br/>\nthis statement by Sandra Dodd, and a response by<br/>\nanother poster rings true to my feelings: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Innocence is as natural as any other progression in<br/>\n&gt;live and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;*********************************<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I agree with this too.  I think it really depends on<br/>\n&gt;the individual <br/>\n&gt;child, and what their level of interest is and where<br/>\n&gt;they are <br/>\n&gt;developmentally.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, for me and my child, it seems right to provide and<br/>\nwithold (by not giving the choice) certain movies that<br/>\ndo not seem appropriate to their psychological and<br/>\nemotional development.  I am happy to keep my 3 year<br/>\nold as &#39;innocent&#39; as possible because I do believe<br/>\nthere are some things he does not need to know or<br/>\nworry about- yet. (For example, rape, murder,<br/>\nabuse...)  At the same time I do know there will be a<br/>\ntime he will be mature enough to digest all that. <br/>\nAnd, I guess, I will just have to cue into his<br/>\ndevelopment to determine that as I&#39;m sure as he gets<br/>\nolder he will be able to provide me with feedback as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;You haven&#39;t offered up any reasons why your son<br/>\n&gt;seeing those movies <br/>\n&gt;would be bad other then you being uncomfortable which<br/>\n&gt;I think has nothing <br/>\n&gt;to do with why he shouldn&#39;t watch them and that he<br/>\n&gt;might freak out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not so much that I would be uncomfortable with my<br/>\nson watching certain images as I would be concerned<br/>\nthat he would not understand them or may want to try<br/>\nto imitate them.  For example, if he sees a violent<br/>\nscene, I would be concerned that he may try it out on<br/>\nhis 1 year old brother.  Also, I think he is not<br/>\nemotionally and psychologically ready to watch sex.  I<br/>\nhave no problem with him watching nudity but do not<br/>\nthink he is ready to watch sex.  We haven&#39;t talked<br/>\nabout it yet, so I don&#39;t feel his first exposure<br/>\nshould be from a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate the comments and am thinking of us all<br/>\nwatching the special effects part of the LOTR DVDs. <br/>\nGood idea, and I know my partner would be excited<br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this got so lengthy!<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
