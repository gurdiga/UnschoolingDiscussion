If this is accompanied by straining or contractions  that then stop; you have definite cause to take further steps. Kids that are  tangled  or badly presented can be the cause. Poor gestational nutrition and selenium deficiency  can be  other common causes of  birthing complications.<br/>\nSome does carrying  multiple fetuses may have ketosis  which can cause them to go off their feed and lay down not cudding and give the empression that labor is imminent.
