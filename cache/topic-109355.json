Many members of our extended family <br/>\nare<br/>\nin education careers, elementary through college level, and we&#39;re<br/>\ncoming up<br/>\non relative season.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of any off the top of my head, I just know that I have <br/>\nlistened with a big grin on my face, on several occasions.  I will <br/>\nstart taking note and maybe ask Kevin some of the things that he has <br/>\ntold his friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know one thing that I often come back at people with is &quot;How much, <br/>\nof what you learned in school, do you actually remember?&quot;  99% of the <br/>\npeople I ask that too go &quot;Uuuuhhhhh, not much.&quot;  Thank you, point <br/>\nmade!  The other day I got in a very heated discussion with a group of <br/>\npro-public school people.  After the discussion had died down the <br/>\ngroup was discussing the school schedule and the reason that school is <br/>\nstarting earlier here is so the testing can be done before Christmas, <br/>\notherwise the kids forget what they learned during the holidays.  I <br/>\npiped up with &quot;Well, I guess that proves that they really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; it in the first place!&quot;  I got a bunch of blank stares <br/>\nbut I think I made my point.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109332,"nextTopicId":37564}}
