I&#39;m trying to decide<br/>\n  &gt; between going by myself or talking my family into coming. Dh would not<br/>\nbe<br/>\n  &gt; into it, but I&#39;m wondering how many little children might be attending.<br/>\nMine<br/>\n  &gt; are 6, 5 and 3.5, so I&#39;m just not sure that they would get much out of<br/>\nit,<br/>\n  &gt; you know?  It could be fun to just road trip with some of the other moms<br/>\n  &gt; here. What would you all suggest?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; When we went last year, Jayn was 3.5 and she still talks about the hotel<br/>\n  &gt; where she met Heather (Shyrley&#39;s daughter). It is true that I missed a<br/>\n  &gt; couple of sessions, and spent less time just talking in groups than I<br/>\nwould<br/>\n  &gt; have without Jayn there. However it was great for her to play and meet<br/>\n  &gt; others also. With my DH, James attending, we did as we always do, and<br/>\n  &gt; switched out who was supervising Jayn. This worked very well. Road<br/>\ntripping<br/>\n  &gt; with Mom&#39;s would probably be fantastic. OTOH I really loved seeing the<br/>\n  &gt; children, as well as the Moms. I say to you find any way of going in any<br/>\n  &gt; combination - some people bring only some of their children, some bring<br/>\nall,<br/>\n  &gt; others none. My DH attended the father&#39;s meeting (in the Sports Bar) and<br/>\n  &gt; apparently there were plenty of questioning dads who were given a lot to<br/>\n  &gt; think about. I don&#39;t know exactly what, since there was a vow of secrecy<br/>\n  &gt; taken.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Robyn L.
