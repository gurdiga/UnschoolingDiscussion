I read about banana peels for warts<br/>\nin _Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child_ by Zand, Walton and Rountree.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know if it would work on plantars warts, but it did.  He had a<br/>\ncluster of 4 on his foot.  Every night, before bed, we would put a fresh<br/>\nslice of banana peel on the warts, inside side facing the skin, and cover<br/>\nwith a band-aid.  After about a month, it looked like the &quot;seed&quot; of the wart<br/>\n(the blackisk spots that are usually inside) were at the surface.  We went<br/>\nswimming for the day, and they came out.  There were little craters where<br/>\nthe warts used to be.  There was no pain and no blood.  In a few weeks the<br/>\nskin had evened out and you couldn&#39;t tell that there had ever been warts<br/>\nthere!<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW,<br/>\nMarjorie<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

He has a plantars wart getting worse <br/>\nand worse, after two liquid nitrogen treatments.   But while they were there <br/>\nKeith was asking the guy about why the brace I have is painful and this way <br/>\nand that angle...  The podiatrist explained it all to Keith&#39;s satisfaction, <br/>\nwho came home and made me feel better about it too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing is I can take it off to take a bath.  The bad thing is I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave a good bathtub, and the one we have is upstairs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing is it&#39;s the last phase, probably, of the painful yuckiness.  <br/>\nThe bad thing is it&#39;s supposed to stay on until December 31 or longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s called a Bledsoe Boot.

So to step down all the way, my knee has to be <br/>\nbent.  I&#39;m walking like a monkey now to keep from  having to walk like a <br/>\nmonkey later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...  They said go from 0 to 100% weight over the next three or four weeks. <br/>\n So this is zero day.  I was already standing on that other cast (using it as <br/>\na kick-stand, Holly said) so I&#39;ve done that some.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll get there.
