Just from not having the pressure for this past week I can already <br/>\nsee the change in my kids, subtle but there.  My older two boys actually got <br/>\ntwo &quot;educational&quot; books at the library -- one about the fifty states and one <br/>\nabout space that they&#39;ve been reading through and they&#39;ve all been spending <br/>\nmore time playing outside and just seem a little happier to me.  Maybe I&#39;m <br/>\njust noticing things they&#39;d be doing anyway, having high hopes for <br/>\nunschooling, but I have noticed it!  My 10 y/o continues to say how he wants <br/>\nto do workbooks, etc. but he hasn&#39;t touched one this week and they&#39;ve all <br/>\nbeen readily available to him!
