And phonics may <br/>\nnot have been the first step in the reading process. Sounding out words can <br/>\nbe a small part of an even bigger reading process. In fact, it has to be. I <br/>\nknow I don&#39;t sit there sounding out each and every word I read.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Language comes �naturally� to children. In our infancy, turning the sounds <br/>\n&gt;&gt;we hear into spoken sounds is a natural act that does not need to be <br/>\n&gt;&gt;taught. So speaking is like walking in the sense of being a natural skill. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;But reading and writing -- the two parts of literacy<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- are not natural acts or skills. They must be learned.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey must be LEARNED, but not ncessarily taught. Like walking and talking, I <br/>\nbelieve reading and writing come naturally once a child&#39;s brain and body is <br/>\nphysically ready to learn them. And like the language they hear every day, <br/>\nmost children in this day and age are surrounded by the printed word. They <br/>\nare immersed in it and its uses and naturally want to mimic and learn what <br/>\nthey see the adults doing. We don&#39;t sit the down to teach them to talk, and <br/>\nI don&#39;t believe we need to sit them down for reading/writing lessons either. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a part of the day and a part of their lives. They learn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Unfortunately for several generations of school children, WL tries to <br/>\n&gt;&gt;teach reading as though it were a pictographic language&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Whole Language and Look-Say are two different methods. I thought Pam gave a <br/>\nvery good description of a Whole Language classroom. My son Conor was in a <br/>\nWL classroom and I thought it was great. Where the schools were failing was <br/>\nin insisting kids were &quot;behind&quot; if they didn&#39;t read on the school&#39;s <br/>\ntimetable. (Well, that&#39;s one place the schools were failing anyway. ;-)) And <br/>\nyes, there were plenty of phonics games and sheets and puzzles and <br/>\nactivities in his classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Whole Language advocates �immersing� the child in �literature,� and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;expects that to be enough to inspire him/her to read.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ahhh...it worked for my kids. Harry Potter was the final ticket for Conor. <br/>\nHe wanted to read it so badly and I just wasn&#39;t going fast enough. After <br/>\nyears of being labelled as learning disabled, he finished the first book in <br/>\na day at age 9. He was ready. Casey was inspired by The Magic Treehouse <br/>\nBooks. Those were the ones she just had to read for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Play with words and letters as long as it�s enjoyable for you and your <br/>\n&gt;&gt;child.

They must be learned.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, but learning is natural and they can be learned naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;One reason why public schools are doing such a poor job is that they<br/>\n<br/>\nabandoned the Phonics method of teaching reading about fifty years ago,&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not true.  Phonics has not been abandoned for fifty years.  SOME <br/>\nschool districts and some reading-method manufacturers have moved away from <br/>\nphonics, but it has always been there, and many districts flip-flopped from <br/>\npurchase to purchase (five year cycles or however often they decided on <br/>\ntextbooks).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf phonicst abandoned.<br/>\n<br/>\nA hundred and fifty years ago in one-room schoolhouses with teenaged girls as <br/>\nteachers, they were teaching by rote.  And rote is recitation and <br/>\nmemorization and doesn&#39;t involve a bunch of phonetic analysis and markings.  <br/>\nAt one time phonics was new, right?  When?  That might be worth looking at, <br/>\nNed, to make you feel better and to help you clarify what you want to tell <br/>\npeople.  To simply say fifty years ago something was abandoned is <br/>\nproblematical.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Phonics  (also known as Phonetics)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonetics and phonics are not the same term nor the same field of inquiry.<br/>\nThey&#39;re from the same word root, and they&#39;re related, but they&#39;re not the <br/>\nsame.  <br/>\nIt would be a bit like saying &quot;intro to auto mechanics (also known as <br/>\nmechanical engineering).&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Despite what many school teachers want us to believe, English is a very<br/>\n<br/>\nregular language and reading can be learned quickly, easily and painlessly.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish is probably the most irregular language on the planet because <br/>\nspelling was codified before some sound-shifts took place, we have words from <br/>\nfour different languages making up the bulk of everyday terms, and from <br/>\ndozens of other languages too.  Latin and Norman French have some <br/>\nsimilarities as to pronunciation of phonemes, but the Germanic Anglo Saxon <br/>\n(or most common and easiest phonetic words) and Greek are very different.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Of course there are weird exceptions that need to be learned individually,<br/>\n<br/>\nbut mostly it follows a very few, simple rules.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason it follows a few simple rules is that the bulk of short, easy <br/>\nwords are Anglo-Saxon words.  The sentence just before this--probably only <br/>\n&quot;reason&quot; is from French/Latin, and the rest is Saxon.  (&quot;Simple&quot; is probably <br/>\nFrench too, but it&#39;s been in English for 800 years or so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree too that it&#39;s easy for kids to learn to read.  But I don&#39;t agree that <br/>\nthey have to &quot;learn phonics&quot; first.  Reading is much more complex than a <br/>\nsimple code to break, and yet people are so brilliantly smart that they can, <br/>\non their own, develop a way to do a very complex thing.  Not all people learn <br/>\nthe same way, nor decode the same way.  There are LOTS of everyday Saxon <br/>\nwords which do not follow phonetic rules.  Most do.  But phonics won&#39;t help <br/>\nwith the whole set of through, tough, trough, brought kinds of things which <br/>\nonce were pronounced with a throat hoik (fricative glottal stop?  What&#39;s the <br/>\nname for that, any descriptive linguists in the house?) which is why the <br/>\nsound is there, but which are kept that way with that spelling because <br/>\nmillions of English speakers are reading visually.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed, there are new homeschoolers on this list whose kids can&#39;t read yet, and <br/>\nthe information you&#39;ve just sent the list is more about your opinion of <br/>\nschools than about how reading works.  You seem obsessed with politics and <br/>\nthe satanic nature of whole language. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people here with several reading children, there are people here <br/>\nwho have taught school, taught reading, read or done research on learning <br/>\ntheory and cognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you share what your family does and believes that&#39;s great.  But when you <br/>\nword it in such a way that it speaks for all schools and all readers of <br/>\nEnglish, you move out of a defensible and helpful stance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly just asked how to spell &quot;once.&quot;  I told her.

You¹re<br/>\nreading this, so you know Phonics. You might not have learned all (or even<br/>\nmany) of the rules, but still you know how reading happens -- you are making<br/>\nsounds that correspond to the letters in print.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, terms:  LANGUAGE is what we speak (³lang² means tongue). Language is<br/>\nthe sounds that our speech makes. That¹s true even when we read silently --<br/>\nwe ³hear² the words in our heads. Language comes ³naturally² to children. In<br/>\nour infancy, turning the sounds we hear into spoken sounds is a natural act<br/>\nthat does not need to be taught. So speaking is like walking in the sense of<br/>\nbeing a natural skill. But reading and writing -- the two parts of literacy<br/>\n-- are not natural acts or skills. They must be learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two kinds of writing: PICTOGRAPHIC and PHONETIC. In pictographic<br/>\nwriting, ideas are represented by symbolic pictures or ³ideographs² as in<br/>\nhieroglyphic pictographs. Learning a pictographic language, such as Chinese,<br/>\nrequires the memorization of the designs of a great many symbols in order to<br/>\ncommunicate accurately, and even then, it can be problematic because the<br/>\npictographs represent ideas, not specific words. In phonetic languages,<br/>\nletters and letter combinations represent the actual individual sounds of<br/>\nthe spoken language.  With phonetic languages such as English, Spanish, and<br/>\nHebrew, there are only a few sounds, and since letters represent those<br/>\nsounds, words are communicated accurately, and therefore, meaning is precise<br/>\nand clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason why public schools are doing such a poor job is that they<br/>\nabandoned the Phonics method of teaching reading about fifty years ago, in<br/>\nfavor of ³Whole Language.² Unfortunately for several generations of school<br/>\nchildren, WL tries to teach reading as though it were a pictographic<br/>\nlanguage -- one that requires children to memorize words whole -- by their<br/>\ndesign (³Look-Say²) -- not as a phonetic code that connects letters to<br/>\nsounds (sounding out). Using repetition (as in Dick and Jane), Whole<br/>\nLanguage depends on recognition of whole words by their looks, as though<br/>\nthey were ideographs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result is confusion and reading problems: Children in public schools are<br/>\nnot  taught how to decode words by time-tested phonetics (Phonics), but are<br/>\nforced to guess at new whole words (using pictures and context clues)<br/>\ninstead of sounding them out by using the letters. Whole Language does not<br/>\nwork because it leaves out the key to how our language works. Phonics is the<br/>\nkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, we¹ve read that a National Reading Panel has advocated a ³blend²<br/>\nof Phonics and Whole Language. That smacks of politics since the two are not<br/>\nblendable -- one teaches how to read and the other does not. Whole Language<br/>\nadvocates ³immersing² the child in ³literature,² and expects that to be<br/>\nenough to inspire him/her to read. It¹s not -- it¹s merely therapy. Reading<br/>\nrequires skill and specific knowledge. Children need to learn how to convert<br/>\nthe marks on the page into specific sounds (sometimes called decoding); in<br/>\nother words, they need Phonics in order to learn HOW to read. After that,<br/>\nmaybe ³immersion² can have some benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics  (also known as Phonetics)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Phonetic writing is perhaps the greatest of man¹s inventions.  It<br/>\nturned guesswork into precision communication. Its use began in about the<br/>\nyear  2000BC.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnglish has 26 letters and 44 sounds. Simple. A child needs to learn the<br/>\nletters, and their sounds both alone and in combinations. The few basic<br/>\nconcepts contain almost all of what a child needs in order to read easily<br/>\nand well. During their first years, children have listened to speech and so<br/>\nthey have what is called ³phonemic awareness² -- they know the sounds of the<br/>\nlanguage -- and begin to imitate them in order to get what they need and<br/>\nwant -- usually MAMA!  But decoding a page of printed words does not come<br/>\nnaturally. The individual marks on the page need to be learned for what they<br/>\nrepresent: The different sounds of the language. That needs to be learned,<br/>\nalthough not necessarily taught, a little at a time. So how can we parents<br/>\nhelp?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen your child is curious (and wants help in learning to read), begin with<br/>\nsingle letters (try magnetized letters on the refrigerator door) and say<br/>\ntheir names and the sounds associated with each, such as A-a (short vowel<br/>\nsound as in Am and At) and E (as in Egg, and set) and I (In or It); Up, hOt,<br/>\netc.  Next step,   BAG or CAT, then start changing one letter at a time:<br/>\nBAG-BAD-BAT-CAT-CUT-COT-HOT-HAT-HIT-SIT-SET-LET, etc. One book comes to mind<br/>\nas a good primer for reading phonetically: Cat in the Hat, by Dr. Seuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay with words and letters as long as it¹s enjoyable for you and your<br/>\nchild. When it¹s not interesting, let it go. There¹s no hurry. Some children<br/>\nbecome interested in reading when they¹re 3 or 4, some when they¹re 10 or<br/>\n12. By the time they¹re 16, no one can tell who learned first. Forcing or<br/>\ncoercing can lead to reading problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you notice that the child gets the idea that letters represent<br/>\nindividual sounds (r-a-t), you¹ve done your job. The child needs to be able<br/>\nto decode  words independently, not to have someone give the pronunciation<br/>\nfor all words, or rely on pictures as clues. You will probably be surprised<br/>\nhow quickly they get it, and once that happens, the rest of the rules --<br/>\nthose for long vowel sounds (such as the final e, changing rat to rate), and<br/>\nvarious combinations of letters -- get easier to learn and use.<br/>\n  <br/>\nDespite what many school teachers want us to believe, English is a very<br/>\nregular language and reading can be learned quickly, easily and painlessly.<br/>\nOf course there are weird exceptions that need to be learned individually,<br/>\nbut mostly it follows a very few, simple rules. Stick with what¹s regular<br/>\nand try not to dwell on the exceptions during the early stages.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39618,"nextTopicId":39640}}
