It always <br/>\n seems like the people that loved school send their own kids, as they see in <br/>\n only a positive light. What was the turning point in your life that lead you <br/>\n to homeschooling and then unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n   I&#39;m not Sandra, but I loved school, too.....I was that skipping, <br/>\nankle-socked child of Popular Culture,  pigtails flying, lunch box clanking,  <br/>\nhappy to go off to a place where you could learn Spanish, paint pictures, <br/>\nplay the cello, run the 50 yd dash, and inhale the library...... ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  But.....I was lucky.  I went to &quot;experiemental schools&quot; for much of my <br/>\ngrade school years, and I had the benefit of a fabulous &quot;talented and gifted&quot; <br/>\nprogram (want to spend hours in the darkroom, learning photography? No <br/>\nproblem.  Study Shakespeare and Plato and Dante, in a symposium? Sure!  Spend <br/>\nhalf the summer at a FREE &quot;camp&quot; for other kids like you, sponsored by the <br/>\nstate of Virginia?  Go for it!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  And I was a great &quot;test-taker&quot; and fit in and got elected to Student Body <br/>\nPresident and made Newspaper Editor and stuff like that and had the &quot;run&quot; of <br/>\nthe halls and more freedom that 95% of the other students--unfairly so.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT, very few schools are like that....the 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s were the <br/>\nheyday of academic experimentation in &quot;alternative public learning&quot; and Free <br/>\nSchools and other early Holt-ian concepts.  And, my firstborn was not rough <br/>\nand tough and bold and left-brained; she was sensitive and timid and dreamy <br/>\nand right-brained and thus I *knew* that not only were the schools I had the <br/>\nopportunity to inflict upon here nowhere near as benign as mine had been, but <br/>\nshe was a personality type that would be *shredded* by the System.  When we <br/>\nmoved the sofa to vacuum after her first few months traumatized in First <br/>\nGrade, and saw the PILES of blonde, curly hair that she had twisted and <br/>\nknotted and yanked out and tossed back there, in her post-traumatic, <br/>\nafter-school, stressed television viewing sessions, we internalized what we&#39;d <br/>\nalready suspected: that School and Ellie were a deadly mix. <br/>\n<br/>\n  And, I&#39;d not had my first child till I was 32, she was the light of our <br/>\nlives, and I never had adjusted to the &quot;notion&quot; that ripping a 4 yr. old <br/>\nchild (she wasn&#39;t even 5 went I first, insanely, placed her on the bus for <br/>\nthe 40 minute ride to kindergarden!) away from her family to insure her <br/>\n&quot;socialization&quot; was a Good Thing.  I wanted her back.  We brought her back. <br/>\nAnd after that, I began reading and reading and researching and meeting other <br/>\nhomeschoolers and my list of justifications for homeschooling grew and <br/>\ngrew......<br/>\n<br/>\n   But that was the *initial*, deciding ephiphany. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Becky***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and <br/>\nconscientious stupidity.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMartin Luther King Jr. (1929 - 1968), Strength to Love, 1963</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22257,"nextTopicId":22289}}
