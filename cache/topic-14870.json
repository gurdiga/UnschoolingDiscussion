So I got to<br/>\neat my toast and jam and drink my coffee in peace and<br/>\nquiet. While the youngest/ds woke up off and on and<br/>\nnursed. Finally...about 11:30 the kids decided to wake<br/>\nup. Ds wanted to go outside and ride his bike so we<br/>\ngot dressed. He rode around the apartment complex. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time we got back dh(he works from home) had<br/>\nstarted some lunch and dd was dressed. Dd was playing<br/>\nwith her dolls. I finished fixing lunch then we sat<br/>\ndown to eat. after lunch dd did some drawing she is<br/>\nreally getting into drawing faces and making sure all<br/>\nthe body parts are accounted ie. noses, hair etc. Ds<br/>\njoined in with her drawing. Then ds wanted a marker dd<br/>\nhad so we did some talking about taking turns sharing<br/>\netc. The conflict never really got resolved. <br/>\n<br/>\nDd went to her room and drew for a while then she came<br/>\nout to watch a Magic School Bus Video. Several<br/>\nconflicts arose with dd saying ds was being loud and<br/>\nwhere each of them wanted to sit. All those needed to<br/>\nbe worked out then finally peace they watch the video.<br/>\nWhile the kids did things independently I tried to<br/>\npick up the house a little and read a book. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTried to get the kids outside a bit today but not<br/>\nmotivated so we didn&#39;t. Dd is getting ready to get<br/>\nsome special dad time running some errands with her<br/>\nfather. Ds will be going down for a late nap most<br/>\nlikely. ---woops change of plans dd decided to stay<br/>\nhome, ds will go with dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will the evening hold? Good question. Most likely<br/>\ndiner. Lots of questions like how do I spell this mom.<br/>\nReading books. Watching videos. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say we have a typical day ever. We have a<br/>\nloose weekly schedule of going to library at least<br/>\nonce a week and dd has dance class. My dh and I and<br/>\nthe kids attend a weekly class for some studies we are<br/>\ndoing together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings my kids have known to do during the day<br/>\ninclude: Make flour salt etc. concoctions, paint,<br/>\ndraw, watch lots of videos, read, practice writing, go<br/>\ngrocery shopping, thrift store shopping, I check my<br/>\nemail, bake cookies, play, and play, and play...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Does each child have a project they are working on?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No projects currently here kids have their focuses.<br/>\nds-2 likes me to read him anything about big trucks<br/>\nand big concstruction equipment. Dd-5 is practicing<br/>\nwriting some words. Sometimes she writes them herself<br/>\nbut often she uses a stencil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you approach the art of writing with<br/>\n&gt; unschooling? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Writing as just learning how to write letters or<br/>\nwriting to get accross ideas or both? dd-5 is<br/>\npracticing her letters. She likes to type some words<br/>\non the computer, especially her name. As far as<br/>\ngetting ideas accross. I figure when getting something<br/>\naccross in words on paper become important to them<br/>\nthey will. <br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

He practiced as much as <br/>\nhe felt he needed to.  (His teacher is very pleased. And we like her.)  We <br/>\nwent.  The class had been cancelled.  We went for ice cream cones <br/>\nanyway--something we do after most piano lessons -- the teacher&#39;s house is on <br/>\nthe way!!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter (6 yo) and I usually go to the library while son is at piano.  So <br/>\nnow that has been postponed until tomorrow.  Along with haircuts.  Also <br/>\nconveniently located.  But last time my daughter freaked out at haircuts <br/>\nbecause she said the barber looked scary -- so we&#39;ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nProjects -- we have (maybe because they are younger) few long-term need a lot <br/>\nof commitment type projects.  We have a couple of raised bed gardens and the <br/>\nkids and I putter there, we feed the birds (we did a birdwatching project <br/>\nlast year), we take care of the cats and fish.  But art and science and <br/>\nreading -- any of that is usually done at a sitting.  Or at most involves a <br/>\ntrip to the store to get supplies -- plaster of Paris is now on the list -- <br/>\nmy MIL got us a cool &quot;science projects&quot; book for Christmas -- mostly fun <br/>\nstuff -- how to make goop and a volcano and your own spray paint -- hmmm, <br/>\nmaybe she doesn&#39;t like me a much as I thought!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHandwriting -- my son is an extremely reluctant writer and I don&#39;t push it.  <br/>\nHe uses the computer when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, otoh, has lovely handwriting for 6 and likes to make up stories <br/>\nand, latest, do crossword puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we putter and do a lot of different things and keep a lot of materials <br/>\navailable -- computer and art supplies and microscope and, yesterday we <br/>\ndownloaded Beatles songs and danced and so what subject is that -- is that a <br/>\nproject?<br/>\n<br/>\nMath is a series of CDs and a chalkboard and books and graph paper and money <br/>\nto spend (yesterday my daughter and I totalled up her life savings -- over <br/>\n$21 so she is happy), etc., etc.  Just one darn thing after another. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s &quot;lesson&quot; also included a trip to the Goodwill drop off location in <br/>\nour town.  Along with the appropriate answers to the usual questions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Carol Gilliam","from":"&quot;Carol Gilliam&quot; &lt;jeannie@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"TGr6IacKnXii_Nnf7jnJBxacLnogGWuC1TpuosYHJj6lJuiEtbKC_vaJt01hObwnzXZFG1MZ4g_ZwUJMVTlJFlXyVt6V_oJjj5ArtQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"typical day?","postDate":"978644679","msgId":14870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwMTA0MjE0NC5RQUExNDc4MkBib25lcy53bmNsaW5rLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14873,"prevInTime":14869,"nextInTime":14871,"topicId":14870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am interested in hearing a little of a typical day in the life of an unschooling family.
