If so, there&#39;s a lot more to PW <br/>\nthen just not being able to stop eating. If anyone is interested a <br/>\ngood site is:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pwsausa.org/syndrome/basicfac.htm\">http://www.pwsausa.org/syndrome/basicfac.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my 3 children has problems with food with regards to not <br/>\nknowing when he has consumed to much. He has a enormous appetite in <br/>\ngeneral but when left to his own he has consumed more then his father <br/>\nwho is a big eater as well. I find that cutting down on his sugar, <br/>\nflour and wheat intake has assisted him a lot. I also try to balance <br/>\nhis foods so that when he eats he gets a mix of a protein, carb, and <br/>\nfat. <br/>\n<br/>\nJAMA has published a lot of articles with regards to behavioral <br/>\ncharacteristics of eating. They are pretty interestings to read <br/>\nthrough if you have time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeece have you taken her to an allergist, RD, or nutritionist by <br/>\nchance? Most MD&#39;s don&#39;t really have a clue when it comes to issues <br/>\nsuch as this unfortunately. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she eat a lot of refined foods by chance? Unfortunately we used <br/>\nto. Then when we made the slow switch to whole foods we began to see <br/>\na change and then when we cut down on the sugar, flours and wheat we <br/>\nsaw even more of a change. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can see a dramatic difference when I serve him a pasta dish vs a <br/>\nbarely or quinoa dish not only in the amounts he consumes but the way <br/>\nhe consumes them. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you and your family, I know what your going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace-<br/>\nDawn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106005,"nextTopicId":106024}}
