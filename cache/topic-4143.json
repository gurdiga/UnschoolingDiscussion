The number of lies told<br/>\nabout the Canadian system is unbelievable.  There is a concerted effort by<br/>\nAmerican insurance companies, et. al. to propagandize against a Canadian style<br/>\nsystem which provides more than adequate coverage for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a sickening thing to watch Clinton and company cave in almost immediately<br/>\nto the huge vested interests in the US when attempting to reform health care.<br/>\nThe big lie technique works so well.  Tell everyone that Canadians have no<br/>\nchoice of doctors when in fact we have more freedom to choose our own doctor<br/>\nhere than anyone in the states who is in an HMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nJingoism, chauvinism and blind ignorance prevail.  Ah once again the real aim of<br/>\nschooling is alive and well...serve the interests of the very rich, obey, do NOT<br/>\nthink.  Under no circumstances question the status quo. Everything is WONDERFUL.<br/>\nWe live in the best of all possible worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoor people can die in the streets but it is their own fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am delighted to work in the Canadian system in spite of its imperfections.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s where I must go now.

Luckily, she had been wise enough to<br/>\n&gt; purchase the medical insurance policy available to students through the<br/>\n&gt; college.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sadly, she has already almost maxed out her benefits.  She will need<br/>\n&gt; continuing treatment for many months and years to come.  In addition, her<br/>\n&gt; parents and younger brother must now move out of the house they were renting<br/>\n&gt; into another house which will be more suitable for their handicapped<br/>\n&gt; daughter.  The new house will need to be fitted with a variety of items just<br/>\n&gt; to allow this daughter to function on a daily basis.  Such adaptations will<br/>\n&gt; easily add up to tens of thousands of dollars of additional expense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Friends of the family have already started an effort to raise funds to help<br/>\n&gt; this family meet these anticipated gigantic financial obligations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is just another example of how getting sick or injured in the United<br/>\n&gt; States can not only devastate your health, but your finances as well.  Hey,<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t argue that it&#39;s a great country to live in as long as you&#39;re young,<br/>\n&gt; healthy, and have adequate coverage.  It&#39;s just when one or more of those<br/>\n&gt; factors changes that things can get precarious.  Some time ago, I learned<br/>\n&gt; that the<br/>\n&gt; United States and South Africa are the only two major industrialized<br/>\n&gt; countries<br/>\n&gt; which don&#39;t provide universal medical coverage for all of their citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>best wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html\">http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.
