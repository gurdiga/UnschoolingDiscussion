The ingredients are all biodegradable and <br/>\nphosphate-free (in the laundry and dishwasher detergents) with the<br/>\nbreakdown time of the laundry detergent being about 6 hrs.  Their<br/>\ndishwasher detergent leaves no residue and works well even in hard water,<br/>\nand all their products are highly concentrated so that they are much less<br/>\nexpensive than supermarket brands.  They also manufacture Basic-H , which<br/>\nis probably their best known product.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know where you live,  but perhaps you can find a Shaklee<br/>\ndistributor near you (these products are not sold in stores).  If not, I<br/>\ncan arrange to get you a product guide if you give me your address (my<br/>\ne-mail is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aspang1@...\">aspang1@...</a>).  My family and I have been using Shaklee<br/>\nproducts for about two years, and our health has improved tremendously.<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
