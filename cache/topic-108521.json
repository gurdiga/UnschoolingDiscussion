We are having difficulties with a few of the rooms, so I NEED to know whether you are coming or not. I know many of you reserve your rooms in advance  (because you know how fast they disappear! &lt;g&gt;) and then decide NOT to come at the last minute because of whatever reasons. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut this year, I have need of those rooms at the Sheraton if you are NOT coming!<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease e-mail me off-list  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>  as soon as possible so that I make the necessary changes.<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease feel free to forward this message on to other lists I am not on (RUL, for example, and other local lists).<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":108508,"nextTopicId":108315}}
