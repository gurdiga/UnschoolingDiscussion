Reading the old<br/>\n&gt;+ email, you mentioned that your children didn&#39;t learn multiplication<br/>\n&gt;+ tables until they saw they needed them.  Once they started<br/>\n&gt;+ learning them, did you make them stick to some sort of program<br/>\n&gt;+ or schedule until they had them memorized?<br/>\n&gt;+<br/>\n&gt;+ When do you &quot;make&quot; them complete something, or do a job,<br/>\n&gt;+ or whatever - if at all?  Do they have to &quot;finish what they start&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok.....I wish I could read what I wrote last time so I&#39;d remember where I<br/>\n&gt;stopped or what I could explain better now, but I&#39;ll just give it a try.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you haven&#39;t been to the unschooling.com website, you might enjoy reading<br/>\n&gt;it.  If you ask these kinds of questions there, I think you&#39;ll get some<br/>\n&gt;pretty stark responses, but I&#39;m sure they would contribute to your<br/>\n&gt;understanding of unschooling.  Remember that, like most philosophies,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;unschooling&quot; is a place on a continuum--not a specific set of absolutes.<br/>\n&gt;So what you hear from one unschooler will be different from what you hear<br/>\n&gt;from another.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Ok, to pick up at multiplication tables....my (older 2) children still don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;really KNOW their multiplication tables.  They know HOW to multiply and they<br/>\n&gt;know enough of them to figure out most problems in a relatively short amount<br/>\n&gt;of time, but they still don&#39;t have them all memorized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think when the last time we wrote, I had encouraged them to learn them and<br/>\n&gt;they more or less agreed with me and were working on it.  However, to answer<br/>\n&gt;your question about &quot;sticking to it&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;--at least this<br/>\n&gt;particular time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Anytime I come up against a preconceived notion of &quot;what they should learn&quot;,<br/>\n&gt;I step back and reconsider it.  If my children don&#39;t balk at it, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;necessarily have a reason to reconsider it, but if they do then I try to<br/>\n&gt;look at it through their untarnished eyes.  (Their untarnished eyes are my<br/>\n&gt;greatest tool in this unschooling journey!  They haven&#39;t been brainwashed by<br/>\n&gt;the institutional school system as I was.)  What is the point of memorizing<br/>\n&gt;multiplication tables?  If my kids know how to figure out the answers to<br/>\n&gt;multiplication problems, does it matter how fast they do them?  Under what<br/>\n&gt;circumstances would they NEED to do multiplication quickly?  How quickly?<br/>\n&gt;When do I use multiplication in my daily life and what are the consequences<br/>\n&gt;of doing it more slowly?  What are the consequences of doing it wrong?  What<br/>\n&gt;motivates me to do it correctly and/or quickly?  What tools do I<br/>\n&gt;always/sometimes/never have at my disposal when I&#39;m doing multiplication?<br/>\n&gt;At what age will my children need to have multiplication tables memorized?<br/>\n&gt;Is it different if they&#39;re an artist or a businessman or an astronaut or a<br/>\n&gt;lawyer or a sales clerk or a homemaker or a chef or a ballerina?  How long<br/>\n&gt;would it take an adult to memorize them if they chose to?  How many adults<br/>\n&gt;have them fully memorized?  (It still takes me longer to remember the upper<br/>\n&gt;7s, 8s and 9s myself.)  What is the practical definition of &quot;memorized&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While I&#39;d still prefer that they memorized their multiplication tables and I<br/>\n&gt;won&#39;t stop encouraging this from time to time, I don&#39;t really think it is<br/>\n&gt;urgent for them to memorize them....nor is it necessarily important for them<br/>\n&gt;to memorize them at all.  I think I probably discussed with you the<br/>\n&gt;differences between &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  (Teaching is only very<br/>\n&gt;distantly related to learning--and only if the &quot;student&quot; is motivated to<br/>\n&gt;learn.)  The differences even apply to &quot;encouraging&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  Only<br/>\n&gt;THEY can &quot;learn&quot;.  It is an internal process over which I have no control.<br/>\n&gt;If you disagree with this, imagine a scenario where it could be true<br/>\n&gt;(teacher and uninterested student) and I think you can agree.  It (relative<br/>\n&gt;futility of teaching) doesn&#39;t stop being true just because it is an<br/>\n&gt;&quot;important&quot; thing to know.  Part of unschooling is giving up that which you<br/>\n&gt;have no control over anyway.  There are ways to manipulate control, but<br/>\n&gt;they&#39;re usually not good for the HUMAN BEING over which control is being<br/>\n&gt;asserted.  And this whole issue of &quot;control&quot; is what I see as the primary<br/>\n&gt;harm inflicted by institutional schools (and, in turn, what makes<br/>\n&gt;Libertarian politics so hard for some people to grasp).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For me, the &quot;balancing act&quot; of unschooling is weighing what I think is<br/>\n&gt;important to know in life with who I hope my children will be as human<br/>\n&gt;beings.  (&quot;Weighing&quot; it means the two things are sometimes equal; sometimes<br/>\n&gt;one side or the other is more important; sometimes they&#39;re both on the same<br/>\n&gt;side of the scale.)  It&#39;s also always interesting to talk with other<br/>\n&gt;homeschooling parents to see the differences in what THEY think is important<br/>\n&gt;to know.  Or, for that matter, to look at various states&#39; mandatory<br/>\n&gt;curriculums.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My son enrolled in a correspondence school last January.  He will be<br/>\n&gt;skipping basic math in order to take Algebra I, II and Geometry (for the<br/>\n&gt;benefit of college admissions).  In order to do Algebra, there are some<br/>\n&gt;basic math concepts that he hasn&#39;t yet learned.  (Rules for multiplying,<br/>\n&gt;dividing fractions, for example.)  So, I found a &quot;review&quot; math book that has<br/>\n&gt;all math concepts from K-8th grade.  He&#39;s used it some, but not much since<br/>\n&gt;he hasn&#39;t started Algebra yet and doesn&#39;t really have much incentive yet.<br/>\n&gt;However, for him, math is very logical and he can understand these concepts<br/>\n&gt;in just seconds, where it took me years of elementary school review to &quot;get<br/>\n&gt;it&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This correspondence school (American School) was his idea (I have mixed<br/>\n&gt;feelings about it), but we&#39;ve paid for it so I expect him to do what he said<br/>\n&gt;he would do.  However.....just last night I went back to tell him goodnight<br/>\n&gt;and he was reading (as always).  I had planned to talk with him about<br/>\n&gt;picking up his American School texts again (following a vacation to<br/>\n&gt;Germany).  But when I went back there, the book he was reading was a physics<br/>\n&gt;book (The Handy Physics Answer Book) that wasn&#39;t part of his American School<br/>\n&gt;work.  I just felt that I couldn&#39;t tell him to put down that valuable book<br/>\n&gt;that he picked on his own in order to read a text book that was (at that<br/>\n&gt;moment, at least) less interesting to him.  He&#39;s always been very interested<br/>\n&gt;in physics, in fact, and reads a lot about physics, physics philosophy, and<br/>\n&gt;physicists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He&#39;s also been learning (teaching himself) how to play the guitar.  Even<br/>\n&gt;that, I can rationalize, may be more important for HIS LIFE than memorizing<br/>\n&gt;his multiplication tables or working in a Biology textbook.  Maybe his life<br/>\n&gt;path will lead him to be the next James Taylor.  Would I rather he be an<br/>\n&gt;accountant if it is his nature to be a musician?  Or maybe learning the<br/>\n&gt;guitar will do nothing more than bring him personal pleasure in life.  Is<br/>\n&gt;that to be discouraged over multiplication tables?  Unschooling allows<br/>\n&gt;people to become who THEY choose to be...who they are TALENTED at being.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I spend a lot of time explaining how unschooling works with my son--my<br/>\n&gt;oldest.  That&#39;s because of several complex reasons.  First, he is the oldest<br/>\n&gt;and I&#39;ve been &quot;figuring him out&quot; for the longest now.  Second, his<br/>\n&gt;particular interests are &quot;conventional&quot; and numerous.  He&#39;s interested in<br/>\n&gt;many scholarly things and I can visualize him as a successful (and happy)<br/>\n&gt;adult in many different vocations.  Third, my second child is more difficult<br/>\n&gt;to explain in terms that would help you understand unschooling.  She even<br/>\n&gt;challenges MY ideas about unschooling on a daily basis!  I&#39;ve only recently<br/>\n&gt;been able to see an adult life for her that makes sense to me and still<br/>\n&gt;holds true to my unschooling beliefs.  My third child is more like my first,<br/>\n&gt;though her interests are quite different from my oldest&#39;s.  (One important<br/>\n&gt;thing they have in common is a passion for reading, which my second child<br/>\n&gt;lacks.)  I&#39;ll have to explain more about that in another letter, though, if<br/>\n&gt;you&#39;re interested.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;OK, the second part of your question had to do with &quot;finishing what they<br/>\n&gt;start&quot;.  I touched on this with regard to Matthew&#39;s choice of American<br/>\n&gt;School above.  We&#39;re paying about $1000 for it and I do expect him to finish<br/>\n&gt;what he started--this commitment he chose to make.  However, on a day-to-day<br/>\n&gt;basis, it&#39;s more complicated than that (as per the example I gave above).  I<br/>\n&gt;want him to finish it, but I&#39;d rather he be true to himself.....if the two<br/>\n&gt;things happen to be in conflict.  I hope they won&#39;t be, but if/when they<br/>\n&gt;are, we&#39;ll take it one issue at a time.  Anyway, I&#39;ll try to explain<br/>\n&gt;something with a more short-term example.....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Again, I would have to start with asking myself, &quot;what are the consequences<br/>\n&gt;of NOT finishing this particular thing?&quot;  In the long term, I believe that<br/>\n&gt;it is a good character trait to finish what you started....usually.  I can<br/>\n&gt;agree that in general terms, it is a good value to have.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>\n&gt;able to stick with something, even if it is not too enjoyable, for a greater<br/>\n&gt;reward.  (The key, often being &quot;reward&quot;--tangible or intangible.)  But in<br/>\n&gt;reality, most of us start WAY more things than we finish.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;And I&#39;ve also done some reading that suggests that starting projects may be<br/>\n&gt;as important, or more important, to a child (and perhaps to an adult) than<br/>\n&gt;finishing them....that they are a necessary part of the process of learning.<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ll use art projects as an example.  When my children were about 4-6 years<br/>\n&gt;old, they went through a process where they worked on an art project to the<br/>\n&gt;point of destroying it.  They would add glue or paint or markers or glitter<br/>\n&gt;to a project to the point of it disintegrating.  Often they would start a<br/>\n&gt;project and lose interest in it before it was done...or more likely, it was<br/>\n&gt;hard to determine what &quot;done&quot; was.  Art was just always a work in progress.<br/>\n&gt;The ACT of creating WAS the purpose.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;While I think it&#39;s probably easier to see this with art than with other<br/>\n&gt;&quot;subjects&quot;, I can see many parallels.  Institutional school has told us the<br/>\n&gt;following lies:  1. Learning is accomplished when you have a<br/>\n&gt;visible/complete/correct product.  2. Learning is linear and sequential.  3.<br/>\n&gt;Learning is measurable.  4. Education means learning a specific set of<br/>\n&gt;information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Instead, I believe that learning is often invisible, always incomplete,<br/>\n&gt;takes place with both correct and incorrect &quot;products&quot;, is almost never<br/>\n&gt;linear nor sequential, is only vaguely measurable and does not include any<br/>\n&gt;particular set of universal information.  So....if your question is &quot;should<br/>\n&gt;I make them finish what they start&quot;? then I would say that learning is never<br/>\n&gt;finished nor, in my house, is it often formally &quot;started&quot;.  It&#39;s just an<br/>\n&gt;ongoing process.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;On a more concrete level (which is what I&#39;m sure you&#39;d rather I explain!),<br/>\n&gt;there ARE projects that do have a beginning, middle, and end in our home.<br/>\n&gt;Specific house-cleaning chores are one thing that comes to mind (but one of<br/>\n&gt;the only things!).  In that case, I do ask that they be completed because<br/>\n&gt;they affect other people.  At the moment, I can&#39;t think of other situations<br/>\n&gt;where I insist on &quot;completion&quot;.  Matt&#39;s American School stuff is a<br/>\n&gt;possibility....we do have money invested in this particular project....I<br/>\n&gt;just don&#39;t think money is a sufficient enough reason to insist on<br/>\n&gt;completion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Does that at all answer your question?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For unschoolers, the bottom line is that IF a thing is important to know--in<br/>\n&gt;REAL LIFE important and/or interesting for that INDIVIDUAL to know, they can<br/>\n&gt;and will learn it.  If you can think of things you&#39;ve learned as an adult, I<br/>\n&gt;think that will make sense to you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For me, a recent example is the learning that I&#39;ve done because of recent<br/>\n&gt;world events.  I can&#39;t say that I necessarily enjoy learning about Islam and<br/>\n&gt;Middle East history, but I am now motivated to learn such things as I feel<br/>\n&gt;they may have an impact on my life and livelihood.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;One last thing....as a mother, I have those natural desires for my children<br/>\n&gt;to be successful.  I want them to be free of financial worries and to be<br/>\n&gt;able to spend time with their children and do enjoyable things with their<br/>\n&gt;lives.  I have a (also natural, I think) fear that unschooling won&#39;t provide<br/>\n&gt;these things.  But I try to balance that with the reality of what I *see* in<br/>\n&gt;them and also, as I said, to acknowledge the lack of control I have over<br/>\n&gt;these things.  Also, I really do feel that unschooling will allow them to<br/>\n&gt;excel in the things that THEY are good at and enjoy.  Every person in<br/>\n&gt;history who we know to be successful accomplished that in an area in which<br/>\n&gt;they had a natural talent.  THAT is the natural order of things--not the way<br/>\n&gt;the schools have manipulated education.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In closing--here&#39;s a related, funny cartoon I read this morning.

My hope is that my children feel the freedom is there and theirs to choose.<br/>\nElana is AZ<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: kaydeecross <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, January 19, 2002 7:25 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: FW: Multiplication II<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Leslie Moyer&quot; &lt;LeslieMoyer@g...&gt; <br/>\n  wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;Remember that, like most philosophies,&quot;unschooling&quot; is a place on a  <br/>\n  &gt;continuum--not a specific set of absolutes.<br/>\n  &gt; So what you hear from one unschooler will be <br/>\n  &gt;different from what you hear<br/>\n  &gt; from another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you Leslie, this post is definately worth reading twice!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really enjoyed your insights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  kolleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n  Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Another great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!

Reading the old<br/>\n+ email, you mentioned that your children didn&#39;t learn multiplication<br/>\n+ tables until they saw they needed them.  Once they started<br/>\n+ learning them, did you make them stick to some sort of program<br/>\n+ or schedule until they had them memorized?<br/>\n+<br/>\n+ When do you &quot;make&quot; them complete something, or do a job,<br/>\n+ or whatever - if at all?  Do they have to &quot;finish what they start&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.....I wish I could read what I wrote last time so I&#39;d remember where I<br/>\nstopped or what I could explain better now, but I&#39;ll just give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t been to the unschooling.com website, you might enjoy reading<br/>\nit.  If you ask these kinds of questions there, I think you&#39;ll get some<br/>\npretty stark responses, but I&#39;m sure they would contribute to your<br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling.  Remember that, like most philosophies,<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; is a place on a continuum--not a specific set of absolutes.<br/>\nSo what you hear from one unschooler will be different from what you hear<br/>\nfrom another.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, to pick up at multiplication tables....my (older 2) children still don&#39;t<br/>\nreally KNOW their multiplication tables.  They know HOW to multiply and they<br/>\nknow enough of them to figure out most problems in a relatively short amount<br/>\nof time, but they still don&#39;t have them all memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when the last time we wrote, I had encouraged them to learn them and<br/>\nthey more or less agreed with me and were working on it.  However, to answer<br/>\nyour question about &quot;sticking to it&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;--at least this<br/>\nparticular time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnytime I come up against a preconceived notion of &quot;what they should learn&quot;,<br/>\nI step back and reconsider it.  If my children don&#39;t balk at it, I don&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily have a reason to reconsider it, but if they do then I try to<br/>\nlook at it through their untarnished eyes.  (Their untarnished eyes are my<br/>\ngreatest tool in this unschooling journey!  They haven&#39;t been brainwashed by<br/>\nthe institutional school system as I was.)  What is the point of memorizing<br/>\nmultiplication tables?  If my kids know how to figure out the answers to<br/>\nmultiplication problems, does it matter how fast they do them?  Under what<br/>\ncircumstances would they NEED to do multiplication quickly?  How quickly?<br/>\nWhen do I use multiplication in my daily life and what are the consequences<br/>\nof doing it more slowly?  What are the consequences of doing it wrong?  What<br/>\nmotivates me to do it correctly and/or quickly?  What tools do I<br/>\nalways/sometimes/never have at my disposal when I&#39;m doing multiplication?<br/>\nAt what age will my children need to have multiplication tables memorized?<br/>\nIs it different if they&#39;re an artist or a businessman or an astronaut or a<br/>\nlawyer or a sales clerk or a homemaker or a chef or a ballerina?  How long<br/>\nwould it take an adult to memorize them if they chose to?  How many adults<br/>\nhave them fully memorized?  (It still takes me longer to remember the upper<br/>\n7s, 8s and 9s myself.)  What is the practical definition of &quot;memorized&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;d still prefer that they memorized their multiplication tables and I<br/>\nwon&#39;t stop encouraging this from time to time, I don&#39;t really think it is<br/>\nurgent for them to memorize them....nor is it necessarily important for them<br/>\nto memorize them at all.  I think I probably discussed with you the<br/>\ndifferences between &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  (Teaching is only very<br/>\ndistantly related to learning--and only if the &quot;student&quot; is motivated to<br/>\nlearn.)  The differences even apply to &quot;encouraging&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  Only<br/>\nTHEY can &quot;learn&quot;.  It is an internal process over which I have no control.<br/>\nIf you disagree with this, imagine a scenario where it could be true<br/>\n(teacher and uninterested student) and I think you can agree.  It (relative<br/>\nfutility of teaching) doesn&#39;t stop being true just because it is an<br/>\n&quot;important&quot; thing to know.  Part of unschooling is giving up that which you<br/>\nhave no control over anyway.  There are ways to manipulate control, but<br/>\nthey&#39;re usually not good for the HUMAN BEING over which control is being<br/>\nasserted.  And this whole issue of &quot;control&quot; is what I see as the primary<br/>\nharm inflicted by institutional schools (and, in turn, what makes<br/>\nLibertarian politics so hard for some people to grasp).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the &quot;balancing act&quot; of unschooling is weighing what I think is<br/>\nimportant to know in life with who I hope my children will be as human<br/>\nbeings.  (&quot;Weighing&quot; it means the two things are sometimes equal; sometimes<br/>\none side or the other is more important; sometimes they&#39;re both on the same<br/>\nside of the scale.)  It&#39;s also always interesting to talk with other<br/>\nhomeschooling parents to see the differences in what THEY think is important<br/>\nto know.  Or, for that matter, to look at various states&#39; mandatory<br/>\ncurriculums.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son enrolled in a correspondence school last January.  He will be<br/>\nskipping basic math in order to take Algebra I, II and Geometry (for the<br/>\nbenefit of college admissions).  In order to do Algebra, there are some<br/>\nbasic math concepts that he hasn&#39;t yet learned.  (Rules for multiplying,<br/>\ndividing fractions, for example.)  So, I found a &quot;review&quot; math book that has<br/>\nall math concepts from K-8th grade.  He&#39;s used it some, but not much since<br/>\nhe hasn&#39;t started Algebra yet and doesn&#39;t really have much incentive yet.<br/>\nHowever, for him, math is very logical and he can understand these concepts<br/>\nin just seconds, where it took me years of elementary school review to &quot;get<br/>\nit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis correspondence school (American School) was his idea (I have mixed<br/>\nfeelings about it), but we&#39;ve paid for it so I expect him to do what he said<br/>\nhe would do.  However.....just last night I went back to tell him goodnight<br/>\nand he was reading (as always).  I had planned to talk with him about<br/>\npicking up his American School texts again (following a vacation to<br/>\nGermany).  But when I went back there, the book he was reading was a physics<br/>\nbook (The Handy Physics Answer Book) that wasn&#39;t part of his American School<br/>\nwork.  I just felt that I couldn&#39;t tell him to put down that valuable book<br/>\nthat he picked on his own in order to read a text book that was (at that<br/>\nmoment, at least) less interesting to him.  He&#39;s always been very interested<br/>\nin physics, in fact, and reads a lot about physics, physics philosophy, and<br/>\nphysicists.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s also been learning (teaching himself) how to play the guitar.  Even<br/>\nthat, I can rationalize, may be more important for HIS LIFE than memorizing<br/>\nhis multiplication tables or working in a Biology textbook.  Maybe his life<br/>\npath will lead him to be the next James Taylor.  Would I rather he be an<br/>\naccountant if it is his nature to be a musician?  Or maybe learning the<br/>\nguitar will do nothing more than bring him personal pleasure in life.  Is<br/>\nthat to be discouraged over multiplication tables?  Unschooling allows<br/>\npeople to become who THEY choose to be...who they are TALENTED at being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend a lot of time explaining how unschooling works with my son--my<br/>\noldest.  That&#39;s because of several complex reasons.  First, he is the oldest<br/>\nand I&#39;ve been &quot;figuring him out&quot; for the longest now.  Second, his<br/>\nparticular interests are &quot;conventional&quot; and numerous.  He&#39;s interested in<br/>\nmany scholarly things and I can visualize him as a successful (and happy)<br/>\nadult in many different vocations.  Third, my second child is more difficult<br/>\nto explain in terms that would help you understand unschooling.  She even<br/>\nchallenges MY ideas about unschooling on a daily basis!  I&#39;ve only recently<br/>\nbeen able to see an adult life for her that makes sense to me and still<br/>\nholds true to my unschooling beliefs.  My third child is more like my first,<br/>\nthough her interests are quite different from my oldest&#39;s.  (One important<br/>\nthing they have in common is a passion for reading, which my second child<br/>\nlacks.)  I&#39;ll have to explain more about that in another letter, though, if<br/>\nyou&#39;re interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, the second part of your question had to do with &quot;finishing what they<br/>\nstart&quot;.  I touched on this with regard to Matthew&#39;s choice of American<br/>\nSchool above.  We&#39;re paying about $1000 for it and I do expect him to finish<br/>\nwhat he started--this commitment he chose to make.  However, on a day-to-day<br/>\nbasis, it&#39;s more complicated than that (as per the example I gave above).  I<br/>\nwant him to finish it, but I&#39;d rather he be true to himself.....if the two<br/>\nthings happen to be in conflict.  I hope they won&#39;t be, but if/when they<br/>\nare, we&#39;ll take it one issue at a time.  Anyway, I&#39;ll try to explain<br/>\nsomething with a more short-term example.....<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I would have to start with asking myself, &quot;what are the consequences<br/>\nof NOT finishing this particular thing?&quot;  In the long term, I believe that<br/>\nit is a good character trait to finish what you started....usually.  I can<br/>\nagree that in general terms, it is a good value to have.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>\nable to stick with something, even if it is not too enjoyable, for a greater<br/>\nreward.  (The key, often being &quot;reward&quot;--tangible or intangible.)  But in<br/>\nreality, most of us start WAY more things than we finish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve also done some reading that suggests that starting projects may be<br/>\nas important, or more important, to a child (and perhaps to an adult) than<br/>\nfinishing them....that they are a necessary part of the process of learning.<br/>\nI&#39;ll use art projects as an example.  When my children were about 4-6 years<br/>\nold, they went through a process where they worked on an art project to the<br/>\npoint of destroying it.  They would add glue or paint or markers or glitter<br/>\nto a project to the point of it disintegrating.  Often they would start a<br/>\nproject and lose interest in it before it was done...or more likely, it was<br/>\nhard to determine what &quot;done&quot; was.  Art was just always a work in progress.<br/>\nThe ACT of creating WAS the purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I think it&#39;s probably easier to see this with art than with other<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot;, I can see many parallels.  Institutional school has told us the<br/>\nfollowing lies:  1. Learning is accomplished when you have a<br/>\nvisible/complete/correct product.  2. Learning is linear and sequential.  3.<br/>\nLearning is measurable.  4. Education means learning a specific set of<br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I believe that learning is often invisible, always incomplete,<br/>\ntakes place with both correct and incorrect &quot;products&quot;, is almost never<br/>\nlinear nor sequential, is only vaguely measurable and does not include any<br/>\nparticular set of universal information.  So....if your question is &quot;should<br/>\nI make them finish what they start&quot;? then I would say that learning is never<br/>\nfinished nor, in my house, is it often formally &quot;started&quot;.  It&#39;s just an<br/>\nongoing process.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more concrete level (which is what I&#39;m sure you&#39;d rather I explain!),<br/>\nthere ARE projects that do have a beginning, middle, and end in our home.<br/>\nSpecific house-cleaning chores are one thing that comes to mind (but one of<br/>\nthe only things!).  In that case, I do ask that they be completed because<br/>\nthey affect other people.  At the moment, I can&#39;t think of other situations<br/>\nwhere I insist on &quot;completion&quot;.  Matt&#39;s American School stuff is a<br/>\npossibility....we do have money invested in this particular project....I<br/>\njust don&#39;t think money is a sufficient enough reason to insist on<br/>\ncompletion.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that at all answer your question?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers, the bottom line is that IF a thing is important to know--in<br/>\nREAL LIFE important and/or interesting for that INDIVIDUAL to know, they can<br/>\nand will learn it.  If you can think of things you&#39;ve learned as an adult, I<br/>\nthink that will make sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, a recent example is the learning that I&#39;ve done because of recent<br/>\nworld events.  I can&#39;t say that I necessarily enjoy learning about Islam and<br/>\nMiddle East history, but I am now motivated to learn such things as I feel<br/>\nthey may have an impact on my life and livelihood.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing....as a mother, I have those natural desires for my children<br/>\nto be successful.  I want them to be free of financial worries and to be<br/>\nable to spend time with their children and do enjoyable things with their<br/>\nlives.  I have a (also natural, I think) fear that unschooling won&#39;t provide<br/>\nthese things.  But I try to balance that with the reality of what I *see* in<br/>\nthem and also, as I said, to acknowledge the lack of control I have over<br/>\nthese things.  Also, I really do feel that unschooling will allow them to<br/>\nexcel in the things that THEY are good at and enjoy.  Every person in<br/>\nhistory who we know to be successful accomplished that in an area in which<br/>\nthey had a natural talent.  THAT is the natural order of things--not the way<br/>\nthe schools have manipulated education.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn closing--here&#39;s a related, funny cartoon I read this morning.
