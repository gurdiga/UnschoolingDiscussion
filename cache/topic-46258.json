I&#39;ve always been odd,<br/>\nliked being by myself, I don&#39;t fit in where we live now, but I have some<br/>\ngood friends and really, much as I love them, I don&#39;t feel the need to be<br/>\naround them a lot.  I&#39;m happy on my own.  I find friendships take a lot<br/>\nof energy that I&#39;d rather be expending on other things right now.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean that in the harsh way it sounds, just my need for<br/>\ncompanionship seems to be less than other folks&#39;.  Maybe you could get<br/>\nout with a friend on the weekend,  join something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids are little and would probably love just playing in a sand box,<br/>\nor going to the park and climbing around on stuff.   If they have toys<br/>\nand a yard and a mom who will read to them and games to play if they want<br/>\nto, TV and drawing stuff and books, then I&#39;d say you&#39;re providing a<br/>\nstimulating environment.

Lots of moms are looking for nice kids to<br/>\nintroduce their own kids too, not just homeschooling moms.  You might<br/>\nmeet some at the park once or twice a week.

It&#39;s probably a good idea for everyone to do so, <br/>\nbut when you&#39;re following the path of least resistance (which in our <br/>\nsociety is school), people are less inclined to worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Also, I am wondering, I feel like I don&#39;t know what to do with <br/>\n&gt;myself so much of the time.

But I had kids relatively late (started <br/>\nat 30) and had a bunch of things I already loved to do. Some of those <br/>\nI&#39;ve dropped or temporarily put on hold (my scuba gear has sat in the <br/>\ncloset for 7+ years now), but some I still try to do, and other new <br/>\nones I&#39;ve added. Mostly I&#39;ve prioritized down to the one or two <br/>\nthings I get the most enjoyment out of and try to concentrate on <br/>\nthose. For me right now, those are doing triathlons (with the <br/>\ntraining that goes along) and writing fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Do you feel isolated?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but then I am really fortunate in that I live in an area with a <br/>\nlot of very active homeschoolers, and that I&#39;ve met an awesome group <br/>\nof other homeschooling families that we hang out with. I feel like I <br/>\nget a full measure of interesting and stimulating conversation each <br/>\nweek, because the other moms in my group are so interesting and <br/>\nvaried! Yes, I know I&#39;m very lucky. But I&#39;ve also put in work to make <br/>\nthis happen (as have all of the other moms).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;Then, I ask, what is a stimulating environment?!

And what type of activities do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;do with other kids and families?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think what is stimulating for each child or family is unique. My DH <br/>\nand I, and not surprisingly our kids are all very active, very social <br/>\npeople. So we tend to enjoy things that go along with our natures. <br/>\nOur kids probably get together with other kids about 4 - 6 days a <br/>\nweek. Regularly, we have homeschool singing group on one day, park <br/>\nday or (wintertime) gym day on another. We have a neighborhood <br/>\nplaygroup as well, and then swimming lessons on another day. I try to <br/>\nleave at least one &quot;free&quot; day in the week, but that inevitably gets <br/>\nfilled with some sort of playdate or field trip. Saturdays are <br/>\nusually a family-only day, and some Sundays we go to church, where a <br/>\nlot of the kids homeschooling friends go as well. In the summer, we <br/>\ncamp a lot, usually with other homeschooling families. Often we go <br/>\nmid-week with just the moms and kids. This summer, I trained with 3 <br/>\nother homeschooling moms for triathlons, so we spent many days at <br/>\nparks and up at the lake watching each others kids while we swam or <br/>\nbiked or ran (ar all three!). We&#39;ve also done field trips to fire <br/>\nstations, bakeries, fish hatcheries, etc.  But overall, I&#39;d put my <br/>\nfamily on the very social, very active end of the spectrum. This is <br/>\nwhat all of us enjoy, and every time I try to have a couple of &quot;quiet <br/>\ndays at home&quot;, all chaos ensues. All 4 of us thrive on being active. <br/>\nI think what will work for any given family really depends a lot on <br/>\nwhat sorts of interests and temperaments the family members have, and <br/>\nwhat is &quot;stimulating&quot; for one, would be overload for another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems like I am walking in circles some days, not knowing what <br/>\n&gt;to do, or what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is no &quot;should&quot; to unschooling. Do what works best for you and <br/>\nfor your family. If you&#39;re happy, healthy, enjoying life and whatever <br/>\nactivities you do, then it&#39;s workgin!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; How did you learn to trust that everything will be ok, that kids <br/>\n&gt;will learn what they need to.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I dunno, I&#39;ve always believed it. And both DH and I know for a fact <br/>\nthat following the status quo of school didn&#39;t work for either of us. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think we could do worse than that, so I know we&#39;re doing <br/>\nfine, if that makes sense. As for the kids learning, I&#39;ve seen it in <br/>\naction. Though we don&#39;t spend much time on academic type things, my <br/>\nson has seemed to pick up all of the same stuff that his friends <br/>\nwho&#39;ve gone off to Kindergarten or first grade do from sitting in a <br/>\nclassroom all day. He&#39;ll come out with things like &quot;Mom, if I take <br/>\nthese 12 peanuts, I can give 3 of them to each of us&quot;. Well, that&#39;s <br/>\ndivision folks, and he didn&#39;t have to be drilled with it to figure it <br/>\nout. He&#39;s also motivated to do things like reading and writing <br/>\nbecause of his other interests. One day he wrote out a bunch of signs <br/>\nfor his Lego people, another day he sounded out all the names of <br/>\nPokemon characters in a book. He just does these things because he&#39;s <br/>\ninterested and learning all the time. The intrinsic desire to learn <br/>\nand grow has never been removed. It&#39;s there from birth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I am so worried that my kids are going to miss something! <br/>\n&gt; Ok, enough questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, maybe it would help to sit down and make a list of things <br/>\nyou&#39;re worried that they&#39;re &quot;missing&quot;.

Whether they unschool <br/>\nor do school at home. Some people just question if they are doing the right <br/>\nthing. I think it&#39;s a matter of the person. I know people who question every <br/>\nday but still do a great job. Sometimes it goes in spurts and some people, <br/>\nlike me, are just so comfortable with it all, they don&#39;t even bother to <br/>\nquestion. I have not yet come to thinking for an instance I&#39;m not doing the <br/>\nright thing. And so far, not been nervous about it. My day may come!! I also <br/>\nthing it really helps to have a great support system. Whether it&#39;s family, <br/>\nfriends or a support group. My husband and I joined a local homeschooling <br/>\ngroup, very friendly to unschoolers when our son was 2. He is now the oldest <br/>\nbeing unschooled. I guess we all grew up knowing and seeing it was the right <br/>\nthing. That&#39;s maybe why we are so comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as hobbies and such, it&#39;s my family and house. That&#39;s it for me. I <br/>\nreally have no time for anything else. For me it works. I guess my computer <br/>\nis my down time and possibly a hobby. I enjoy it and it&#39;s interesting to me <br/>\nall the stuff I run into surfing. My therapy is outside watering the <br/>\ngrass!!! Sounds stupid as we have a sprinkler system but I go out alone with <br/>\nthe dogs and stand with the hose and just water!! My husband thinks I&#39;m <br/>\nnuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 16, 7, 6, and 2. (I&#39;m sounding like a broken record here if you <br/>\nare reading all my posts!) My oldest goes to school. I don&#39;t feel like my <br/>\nchildren at the ages they are at, need a lot of time with other children. <br/>\nThey have friends who come over but it&#39;s not a weekly thing. For us, right <br/>\nnow, I feel it&#39;s important for them to spend time together. When they get <br/>\nolder, I&#39;m sure it will be different.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do quite a few field trips with our support group. My two middle kids <br/>\nalso go every Friday to a homeschooling sports camp at the local park for 3 <br/>\nhours. They wouldn&#39;t miss that for the world. This months so far we have <br/>\ndone a field trip to the local newspaper and football stadium. We had one <br/>\npark day and one yet to come. We also have another field trip to a heavy <br/>\nmachinery co. and one for Legend of Sleep Hollow. Plus with Halloween coming <br/>\nup, we have activities at 3 different community centers and library. My <br/>\nyoungest is also having a birthday which means the local carnival will help <br/>\nus celebrate. So we are active and my kids get out quite often. They hang <br/>\nwith other kids at the field trips and parks and sports camp, but spend a <br/>\nlot of family time at home too. This month was a busy one for us. Most of <br/>\nthe time it&#39;s a few park days and 1-2 field trips a month. In between, <br/>\nthey&#39;ll have a friend over or we&#39;ll do outside stuff together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also want to do Spanish or French class once a week. They havent&#39; <br/>\ndecided which one yet. I will set ip up for them when they decide and when <br/>\nthings slow down a bit, which will probably be next month. Too much for us <br/>\nat this age, doesn&#39;t work. Too many days from home and my kids act like they <br/>\nnever get to play with their things. When they get older, I&#39;m sure they will <br/>\nneed more time with others and I will provide that. For right now, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t and I really don&#39;t either. I don&#39;t even go to the grocery store alone <br/>\nas there is always someone who wants to come along. It works for us but if <br/>\none needs to get out or the kids are showing signs that they need other kid <br/>\ntime more, than go with that. You have to just trust your kids to know what <br/>\nthey need and follow that lead. It just makes it easier if they all are <br/>\nsocial or not together!!!! So far, mine have been cooperating!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\">http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6464451,"authorName":"Amie","from":"&quot;Amie&quot; &lt;tcee1@...&gt;","profile":"mascire2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"new & wondering","postDate":"1034492468","msgId":46258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWMyNzI4NiQ0ZjRkNWYxMCQwMDAwYTM5OEB5b3VyNXJscDNhOTUxNj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46266,"prevInTime":46257,"nextInTime":46259,"topicId":46258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am pretty new to this list.
