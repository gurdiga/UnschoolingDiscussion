We took plexi-glass and created a seperate section so they<br/>\ncould have a land section and a water section.  Then we took somemore<br/>\nplexi-glass and stainless steel wire mesh to enclose a pond filter and<br/>\naeration system.  They are really funny in that they crawl on top the<br/>\nplexi-glass that is the top of the pump cage and dangle their back feet in<br/>\nthe aerated water flow.  They come up when they are called by name and eat<br/>\nshrimp or apples or goldfish grass out of your hands.  The kids also give<br/>\nthem calcium baths (they call it the turtle jacuzzi) in the bathtub.  We<br/>\nhave an all organic yard and they get to &quot;play&quot; in the yard when we have a<br/>\nnice sunny day so they get their sun vitamins that way as well as from the<br/>\nvita light we have on the tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nTennessee is about 10 yo now and we don&#39;t know how old Sweet Pea is.  We<br/>\n&quot;rescued&quot; her about 6 years ago and she was full grown then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the &quot;feeder&quot; goldfish are now over 6 years old and they have their<br/>\nown 45 gallon tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the fish and turtles have just about taken over the house &lt;g&gt;  And<br/>\ndid I mention they now have a tarantulla buddy who is 13 years old?
