For young princes and dukes and such, to wear on state occasions or <br/>\nspecial occasions, or as a gift.  Armorers then and now would practice (or show <br/>\noff) on smaller stuff and give it to young kids.  Not only do they REALLY <br/>\nappreciate it, but the parents do too.  And in a feudal society, sucking up is a <br/>\npart of everyday life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a year ago we &#39;returned&#39; a real steel helm with a hinged fact plate that <br/>\nhad been given to Kirby when he was little.  Though I let him try it on and <br/>\nhe knew it was his, I kept it back for a couple of reasons.  It was dangerous, <br/>\njust the weight of it, for playing.  And the armorer  had made it for his <br/>\ndaughter.  When it was too small for her, the mom gave it to Kirby.   They were <br/>\ndivorced by then, and I figured she was dumping things the dad had owned/made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I saved it, and when the daughter was 23 or so and had graduated from <br/>\ncollege and I figured she was in a position to take care of it herself, I gave it <br/>\nback to her.

What <br/>\ndoes 1/2 a cup look like?  Or 1 oz of cheese, or 3 oz of meat.   Restaurants <br/>\nserve too much food, and the plates we use are too big!  I  actually bought a <br/>\nfood scale, and use it, and now I have a pretty good idea of  how much is what.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I started reducing my portions (at restaurants I eat half and take the  <br/>\nrest home for later), I thought it would be hard to stop eating because I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t feel full.  I did feel full!  Part of it was the healthy food  I am <br/>\neating.  You can eat more volume of better foods if you choose  right.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI had a boss who was known to run up a local mountain and back every  day, <br/>\nfor exercise.  He was really fit--over 40 at the time, ran marathons  and used a <br/>\nstand-up desk at work.  We were at a work-related convention  together, and <br/>\nthere was a hotel-type buffet dinner there for the  attendees.  Jim walked away <br/>\nfrom the buffet table with a very small slice  of meat, and his plate <br/>\ncompletely heaped over with green beans.  Green  beans were the only green vegetable <br/>\non the buffet, besides cold salad.  I  remember seeing his plate and making <br/>\nthe connection about volume of high calorie  food vs volume of low calorie food. <br/>\n I&#39;m sure his reasoning was he could  eat so much MORE food, if he ate the <br/>\nright things.  A feeling of fullness  was surely one of his goals, cuz it was a <br/>\nhuge pile of green beans.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a book about it, I saw recently.  Volumetrics.  I haven&#39;t  read it, <br/>\nyet, but the green bean mountain had to be part of it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe you&#39;re daughter needs some information about portions to help her  <br/>\nfigure out what makes her feel full, etc.  It takes a while to get that  signal <br/>\nfrom the brain.  I don&#39;t usually cook what I eat for others, except  maybe at <br/>\nsupper.  So I only cook one serving of whatever it is, or make a  bunch and <br/>\nfreeze it in individual servings.  I can&#39;t over-eat, because  there isn&#39;t anymore! <br/>\n  I&#39;m 11 pounds down so far.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nHere are a couple of fun quizzes about portions.<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.smartlite.it/diva/quizzes/portion.asp_\">http://users.smartlite.it/diva/quizzes/portion.asp_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.smartlite.it/diva/quizzes/portion.asp)\">http://users.smartlite.it/diva/quizzes/portion.asp)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/_\">http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/)\">http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m going to get that Volumetrics book soon.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93086594,"authorName":"birthinlove","from":"&quot;birthinlove&quot; &lt;brewstersears@...&gt;","profile":"birthinlove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My testimony why NOT to control food","postDate":"1111921919","msgId":104964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyNjRkditrOGRyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyNGkycituMmV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":104963,"nextInTopic":104968,"prevInTime":104963,"nextInTime":104965,"topicId":104939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, Heidi wrote: She ll have a stash of things like soda crackers in a drawer in her bedroom.

We&#39;ve had a dog for 12 years and we <br/>\ncould always just leave food out and he would eat until he was full <br/>\nand leave the rest. Then we got another dog, and she would eat until <br/>\nshe was stuffed and then some. She&#39;d eat herself sick. She&#39;d eat <br/>\ngreen apples that had fallen to the ground until she threw up. She <br/>\njust didn&#39;t seem to have the built-in food shut-offs that other dogs <br/>\nI&#39;ve known have had. She died at 9 from a stroke, she was very <br/>\noverweight.

Do you model healthy eating yourself? You don&#39;t have to make <br/>\ndirect comments about *her* eating to give her information about how <br/>\nto make healthy food choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter recently got a bag of <br/>\npretzels, which is one of her favorite foods, and she just kept <br/>\neating them. After awhile, she said her stomach hurt. She had eaten <br/>\na *lot* of pretzels. So I just non-judgementally said &quot;Yes, <br/>\nsometimes when we eat too much, we get a feeling in our body that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel right. Like your tummy might feel too full, or you <br/>\nmight feel sort of sick. Maybe you had too many pretzels?&quot;  The next <br/>\ntime she got pretzels, I noticed she put them away after awhile. <br/>\nMaybe your daughter is just missing her fullness cues. One thing <br/>\nthat helps some people is just to keep bottles full of nice cold <br/>\nwater around. When you drink some water before eating or with food, <br/>\nyou get to the full point a bit quicker. Each of my kids has a <br/>\nspecial water cup with a straw, and I make sure they always have <br/>\nfresh water all day available to them (of course, they can also get <br/>\njuice or milk or whatever out of the fridge to, but I&#39;ve noticed <br/>\nthat they tend to drink more water when it is readily available.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"bunsofaluminum","from":"&quot;bunsofaluminum&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My testimony why NOT to control food","postDate":"1111891622","msgId":104957,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyNTZyNis5bThvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZhLjUxZmQ1Njk2LjJmNzczN2UzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":104953,"nextInTopic":104958,"prevInTime":104956,"nextInTime":104958,"topicId":104939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... oh, about 7-8.

Still don&#39;t know how they&#39;ll be as  adults.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-so, in our case, no food rules haven&#39;t helped her (yet?) to establish  <br/>\ninternal controls.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe she needs more fruit.  Will she drink juice, or eat toast and  jam or <br/>\nother sweet things?  Could you find a recipe for candy made with  nuts and <br/>\nhoney, maybe?   <br/>\n <br/>\nBut would &quot;internal controls&quot; look like limits to you?  Maybe you&#39;re  looking <br/>\nfor something other than her natural food needs.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKeith (dh) eats lots of salty food, but takes pride in not salting his  food. <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;  He&#39;ll eat chips and microwave popcorn, though.    Kirby likes milk a <br/>\nLOT.  He drinks a lot, eats cereal with milk, adds milk  to hot cereal.  If I <br/>\nwere an anti-milk mom, I could think that Kirby drinks  too much milk, that <br/>\nfreedom hasn&#39;t helped him to self-regulate on milk  consumption.  What that would <br/>\nmean is he drinks more milk than I would give  him if I were doling it out.<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92084939,"authorName":"bunsofaluminum","from":"&quot;bunsofaluminum&quot; &lt;bunsofaluminum60@...&gt;","profile":"heidic40","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My testimony why NOT to control food","postDate":"1111870363","msgId":104952,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyNGkycituMmV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWM1MzIxMCQ0NmJiYjc2MCQwYjAwMDAwYUBNb20+"},"prevInTopic":104939,"nextInTopic":104953,"prevInTime":104951,"nextInTime":104953,"topicId":104939,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve had an open kitchen policy for years.

Even before I heard of <br/>\nunschooling, I&#39;ve always made the kitchen available to my kids. Heck, <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to always be fixing food that they&#39;re capable of doing, <br/>\nso I&#39;ve let them have a lot of freedom in there, always. Though I have <br/>\nin the past made them &quot;at least taste everything on your plate&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my 10 year old is pretty chunky. I&#39;d say 30 lbs overweight. And, <br/>\nshe sneaks foods sometimes. Sometimes getting this &quot;jumpy guilty <br/>\nbusted&quot; look on her face, for eating something that was meant to be <br/>\neaten. As if she was sneaking it when she didn&#39;t need to be sneaky. <br/>\nAlso, hoarding food. She&#39;ll have a stash of things like soda crackers <br/>\nin a drawer in her bedroom. Any candy she buys, she eats it right <br/>\naway. In fact, we recently went through a spate of her stealing money <br/>\nfrom her sibs, in order to go buy sweets. And then lying about where <br/>\nthe money came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, she is craving sugar, and last night made <br/>\nseveral &quot;helpings&quot; of sugar water. The Tang that I bought her at the <br/>\nbeginning of the month (a big Costco sized tub) is gone, but she likes <br/>\nsweet drinks, and so makes sugar water for herself. I don&#39;t bug her <br/>\nabout it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yob isn&#39;t gaining weight, and he lives with the same open policy <br/>\nconcerning food. He just stops when he is full. I&#39;ve never known him <br/>\nto sneak or steal. He eats a lot of sweets, but I think it&#39;s more <br/>\nabout his full sensor. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the difference? Honestly, I NEVER NEVER NEVER say anything <br/>\nabout her weight. EVER. And it&#39;s only a rare occasion when I mention <br/>\nthe seconds or the snacking, and usually in the context of &quot;So and so <br/>\nhasn&#39;t eaten yet.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll need that for a recipe I&#39;m trying out&quot; It <br/>\nis never in the context of &quot;haven&#39;t you had enough, already?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nso, in our case, no food rules haven&#39;t helped her (yet?) to establish <br/>\ninternal controls.

I am 41 years old, I was raised the same way ..very controlling parents when it same to food. We only had candy in our house at Easter and Halloween, No soda, No chips  , I think the only kind of &quot;junk&quot; food we had was Ice cream once a week. My Mom Make everything from &quot;scratch&quot; ,Cookies , cakes on occasion and all meals were homemade....you would think that by me growing up in such a non junk food homemade from scratch kind of home that I today would eat that way...NO. When I moved out of my parents house I stocked up on all kinds of junk..drank soda by the 3 liter (a day) ate candy until I felt sick...all that stuff people think they are &quot;teaching&quot; there kids not to do...<br/>\nI am not saying that every person who is raised to eat only good or mostly good will turn to the worst like I did but I know that I did so my kids have always had free rein over what that want to eat , one is a vegetarian, one would rather have fruits and veggies over chips and candy and one is still finding out what she really likes. So I  would please try to let go of the food control, leave the room when they drink the soda if it bothers you so much. I am not saying that in a mean way , sometimes it helps to look the other way, &quot;what you don&#39;t see wont hurt you kind of thing&quot; I know you will still feel upset when you see the soda disappearing but at least maybe they wont feel your feelings? All I know is that  When I was younger and I went somewhere were they had different deserts and junky kind of foods I would feel like I almost had to  &quot;sneak&quot; some into my pocketbook so I can have some later and that&#39;s really an awful feeling , like a thief over food! And I battle with being 20-25 pounds over weight and its from the junk, that I know in my heart of hearts but its so hard to get away from. My husband on the other hand had all the <br/>\n&quot;junk&quot; he wanted  growing up and he has NO problem taking or leaving it, eats it on  occasion only. So I guess we are both living proof of what has been said about NOT controlling the children&#39;s food .<br/>\nHave a great Easter all, cant wait to do the eggs later!!<br/>\nHeidiK<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Joyce Fetteroll <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, March 26, 2005 6:23 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] parent&#39;s issues food choices (LONG)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Mar 25, 2005, at 9:07 AM, Sears Family wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -no sweet treats before a meal, particularly breakfast.  &quot;healthier <br/>\n  &gt; food first - ie, oatmeal, toast, eggs, fruit, &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  When my daughter has reached for the candy early in the morning I ask <br/>\n  her if she&#39;d like me to make her something. If she doesn&#39;t that would <br/>\n  be okay but so far she&#39;s always said yes. For her, since she can have <br/>\n  as much as she wants the only thing special about candy is that it&#39;s <br/>\n  easier than making a bowl of cereal. But if I offer to make the cereal <br/>\n  then that&#39;s more appealing to her for breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, without a rule, with the freedom to eat candy for breakfast she <br/>\n  chooses &quot;healthier food first&quot; just because it&#39;s more appealing to her <br/>\n  for breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of <br/>\n  &gt; ice cream)- sometimes because I&#39;m triggered, sometimes because I&#39;d <br/>\n  &gt; like to make the box of ice cream last longer, since the budget is not <br/>\n  &gt; allowing lots of leeway<br/>\n<br/>\n  What you&#39;re saying with this is that your wants are more important than <br/>\n  their wants. And since you&#39;re bigger and stronger you get to have your <br/>\n  way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What if you really really wanted a bowl of ice cream and nothing felt <br/>\n  like it would satisfy that craving and your husband said, no you can&#39;t, <br/>\n  we need to make it last?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If there&#39;s a special event that&#39;s it being saved for they&#39;ll understand <br/>\n  -- if it isn&#39;t commonly limited. But what better use for ice cream <br/>\n  could there be than to have happy kids :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often <br/>\n  &gt; suggest another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls <br/>\n  &gt; of oatmeal - perhaps their body might like something else?  This is <br/>\n  &gt; likely along the lines of open chioces - after I&#39;ve said that, if they <br/>\n  &gt; still want oatmeal - I am happy to make it.  If it were to be ice <br/>\n  &gt; cream - that would be a different story.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When my husband had a week long business trip I had spaghetti every <br/>\n  night for dinner. Why should someone have to be an adult to have the <br/>\n  freedom to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n  What if you had to live your life asking your husband&#39;s permission and <br/>\n  help for everything you wanted? Maybe try that for a week! Every time <br/>\n  you start to do something independently -- even decisions about what to <br/>\n  buy at the store, what to make for dinner -- imagine having to ask your <br/>\n  husband if it&#39;s okay, or for him to do it for you. Imagine if his <br/>\n  priorities were different and he&#39;d often say no because he didn&#39;t like <br/>\n  the choices you made.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide <br/>\n  &gt; them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase <br/>\n  &gt; whatever they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they <br/>\n  &gt; often ask if what they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I <br/>\n  &gt; have truly graduated to the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That <br/>\n  &gt; would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What&#39;s your favorite food? What if the only way you could get out into <br/>\n  the world and out to where your favorite food (or book or movie) was <br/>\n  was to go with him? And what if you were out with him and the thing you <br/>\n  really wanted was right there within reach and he said no?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If we as adults had to live our lives as kids, being dependent on <br/>\n  someone, asking permission for each thing we wanted, we&#39;d go nuts! <br/>\n  (And, hey, it might happen! And it might be our kids that we&#39;re saying <br/>\n  &quot;No, your needs and wants aren&#39;t what I want to do for you. You can <br/>\n  take what I think you need,&quot; who are taking care of us!) *Life* and <br/>\n  society so severely restrict kids&#39; freedom to get what they want for <br/>\n  themselves. We can add to that and be additional controllers in their <br/>\n  lives. Or we can be their partners and recognize that they don&#39;t have <br/>\n  the freedoms that we do and compassionately help them get what they <br/>\n  want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The less needy they are, the less they&#39;ll need. If they know that 75% <br/>\n  of their requests will be turned down, they have to ask for a lot more <br/>\n  to get a better chance of getting the things they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; -pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and <br/>\n  &gt; the times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in <br/>\n  &gt; the cold cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have <br/>\n  &gt; pop in between is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger <br/>\n  &gt; for me.  I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the <br/>\n  &gt; total lack of nutrition in it, and the large amount of <br/>\n  &gt; calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will probably be the last thing <br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;ll let go of.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And what you&#39;re doing by making pop for special occasions is making it <br/>\n  something special to be greatly desired. Is that what you want? I&#39;ve <br/>\n  got 2 cases of Coke sitting in the closet for anyone to take. It&#39;s rare <br/>\n  when anyone other than me takes one.<br/>\n<br/>\n  By limiting it you&#39;re creating a desire for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
