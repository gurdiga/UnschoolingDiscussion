It HURTS!!!  But you get over it pretty quick. BG","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-912579099\">Hi Glena,<br/>\n<br/>\nI had my navel pierced as a teenager.  It HURTS!!!  But you get over it <br/>\npretty quick. &gt;BG&lt;  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all.   The problem I <br/>\nhad with my navel piercing was that I had severe rejection.  The skin <br/>\nsurrounding the piercing began to grow AROUND the ring!  Like a tube of skin <br/>\ncovering it.  It was UGLY, PAINFUL and eeewww!  It became severely infected <br/>\nbecause I was dumb and didn&#39;t take it out right away.  Not many people <br/>\nexperience this and until you actually get the piercing, you don&#39;t know if <br/>\nit will happen to you or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion would be to let her do it.  It&#39;s not permanent...she can always <br/>\ntake it out and will have two teeny scars that will be barely noticable.  <br/>\nEven my scarring is very hard to see and I had a bad experience with it.  <br/>\nJust looks like two microscopic pin dots.  (Pretty minute in comparison to <br/>\nthe eight kids worth of stretch marks!!! LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust be sure the shop is licensed and uses NEW needles and sterile <br/>\ntechniques.  They will clamp her navel and use a hollow needle...about an <br/>\n16/18 guage, if memory serves me right.  Then they hook the ring or bar on <br/>\nand pull it through.  It was a rather nauseating experience but I was <br/>\nthrilled with the result for the few days before the rejection kicked in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like she has done her homework!  I would insist on keeping it clean <br/>\nat all times and covered with a loose bandage if she will be wearing <br/>\nanything that will come in contact with it until it is healed.  Shouldn&#39;t <br/>\ntake too terribly long.  Witch hazel works very well along with a triple <br/>\nantibiotic ointment until it is healed completely.  Also be sure to let it <br/>\nget fresh air as much as possible.  Easiest time is after a shower.  Clean <br/>\nit with witch hazel and allow it to air out....no ointment, bandages or <br/>\nclothing.  Other than that, have fun!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
