Sometimes it&#39;s just the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, the Ministry of Education announced plans to introduce a <br/>\nlighter curriculum in public schools by 2002 after it received complaints <br/>\nfrom parents and others that the education system put too much pressure <br/>\non students. Now some students are paralyzed with boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;dumbing down&quot; of Japan&#39;s education system is one of the reasons that <br/>\nprivate schools, especially junior highs, are gaining in popularity. A <br/>\nworse problem, *gakkyu hokai*, which is the total breakdown of classroom <br/>\norder, may be another cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter-school *juku* (cram schools) that claim to prepare children for <br/>\nprivate junior high school entrance exams are thriving accordingly. Asahi <br/>\nShimbun has received stacks of letters from parents, students and <br/>\nteachers on the volatile subject of *juku*. Here is a sampling:<br/>\n<br/>\nPiano teacher, 37, Tokyo:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is in fifth grade of elementary school. He goes regularly to a <br/>\ncram school to prepare for private junior high school entrance exams. <br/>\nHe&#39;s had to give up his extracurricular activities that he used to enjoy, <br/>\nand his time to play with his friends and sleep are both limited -- but <br/>\neven so, I feel it&#39;s better than having him go to a public junior high <br/>\nschool in Tokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel this way for two reasons. First of all, public junior and senior <br/>\nhigh schools nowadays are absolutely chaotic. Secondly, I don&#39;t trust the <br/>\ngrading system in use in the public schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Tokyo&#39;s public schools, student delinquency is simply taken for <br/>\ngranted. Nobody tries to do anything about it. Kids talk on cell phones <br/>\nin class. They stay out all night drinking. Even their parents seem to <br/>\nhave given up on them. &quot;That&#39;s the way kids are today,&quot; they say.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, public junior high schools raise the grades of <br/>\nstudents going on to public senior high schools at the expense of those <br/>\nplanning to enter private senior high schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Editor&#39;s note: In each public junior high school class, a fixed <br/>\nproportion of students must be given the top grade of 5, a slightly <br/>\nlarger proportion a grade of 4, and so on, all the way down to 1. <br/>\nTogether with entrance exams, these grades determine admission to senior <br/>\nhigh school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, teachers have begun to use this grading system as a club to <br/>\nbeat the students with. &quot;That sort of behavior will affect your grades,&quot; <br/>\nthey threaten -- as if to encourage students to fawn on them and worm <br/>\ntheir way into their good graces for the sake of marks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomemaker, 44, Hyogo Prefecture:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two childen attended a school well-known for its *sogo gakushu* <br/>\n(comprehensive studies). The teachers were wonderful, but the problem was <br/>\nthat so much of the school day was taken up with comprehensive studies <br/>\nthat there was scarcely any time for the basic subjects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my older child was about to graduate from elementary school the <br/>\nteacher assured me, and I believed it, that academic skills come <br/>\nnaturally with the mastering of &quot;life skills&quot;; therefore it was not <br/>\nnecessary to send the child to cram school.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine my surprise when the junior high school homeroom teacher <br/>\ncomplained to me that my child totally lacked basic academic skills! When <br/>\nI talked with other mothers, I found that they had all been sending their <br/>\nchildren to cram schools since their second year of elementary school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I did with my younger child -- who seems to prefer the <br/>\nafter-school study: &quot;School&#39;s okay, but at *juku* we learn all kinds of <br/>\nthings I didn&#39;t know, so it&#39;s really fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHomemaker, 48, Fukuoka Prefecture:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle daughter is now a first-year university student.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust before she graduated from elementary school, we moved. Almost all <br/>\nthe public junior high schools in our new neighborhood were in a state of <br/>\nchaos. We had to move fast. We had her take private junior high school <br/>\nadmission tests, which fortunately she passed, and she enjoyed six <br/>\npeaceful years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was different with my youngest daughter. Shortly after we moved, her <br/>\nschool was hit by a wave of *gakkyu hokai* (classroom breakdown). Two or <br/>\nthree of the boys were running amok in class, attacking the other <br/>\nchildren and even the teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching became utterly impossible. I don&#39;t know how many PTA meetings <br/>\nwere held. Anyway, my daughter absolutely refused to go to a public <br/>\njunior high school -- and insisted on being sent to cram school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could not easily afford to send both girls to private schools, but a <br/>\nlearning environment in which children can study undistracted is surely <br/>\nworth financial sacrifice. I think that unless public schools change, the <br/>\nexodus into private schools will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond-year student, 17, of a private girls&#39; high school in Osaka:<br/>\n<br/>\nElementary school was difficult for me, especially the math.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was most important was treating everyone the same. Every effort was <br/>\nmade to make sure everyone got through the material and nobody fell behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Some students will understand something after hearing it just once; <br/>\nothers will need to hear it 20 times before they understand,&quot; the <br/>\nteachers would say. But what is the student who understands the first <br/>\ntime supposed to do during the remaining 19 explanations? The slow <br/>\nstudents improve, but the ones who learn quickly are simply wasting their <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to wait until everyone learns what&#39;s being taught. <br/>\nBut when the lesson has to slow to the pace of kids who don&#39;t even know <br/>\ntheir multiplication tables, it&#39;s terribly boring. If those who can do a <br/>\ntest in five minutes have to just sit there for 45 minutes, they will <br/>\ninevitably lose interest in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird-year student, 17, at a private high school in Yokohama:<br/>\n<br/>\nElementary school Japanese, math, social studies and science were all <br/>\nboring. Lots of people say that. Japanese was just writing simple Chinese <br/>\ncharacters and reading easy stories. Math was extremely basic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the cram school, on the other hand, they gave us novels and essays to <br/>\nread, and we learned a lot of interesting word combinations. In math we <br/>\nhad to solve difficult problems. For kids who have a thirst for <br/>\nknowledge, school is just not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt elementary school, they treat everyone equally. They don&#39;t want one <br/>\nstudent to be different from another. The lessons are easy so that <br/>\neveryone will be able to understand them. As a result, students with <br/>\ngenuine ability don&#39;t have the chance to develop it. What a waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond-year student, 14, at a public junior high school in Osaka:<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t stand kids who spend their time going to cram school and cramming <br/>\nfor exams. I never study. I never listen in class either. Don&#39;t have to. <br/>\nI can pass without working. The teachers say, &quot;If only you&#39;d try a little <br/>\nharder, you could go anywhere.&quot; That&#39;s just noise to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some friends who are pretty bad dudes. To me, they&#39;re a lot more <br/>\ninteresting than the nerds who do nothing but study.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind kids studying because they know what they want to do in <br/>\nlife. &quot;In future, I want to be such-and-such, so I&#39;m going to a private <br/>\njunior high.&quot; That&#39;s okay. But &quot;I&#39;m going to a private school to get away <br/>\nfrom bullying&quot; -- no. People should study in order to get ahead in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher, 41, at a junior high school in Mie Prefecture:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to decide whether to send my elementary school daughter to <br/>\npublic or private junior high. I teach at a public junior high, but the <br/>\ntruth is I don&#39;t have much confidence in the public school system.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, there isn&#39;t enough class time. For example, for a course <br/>\nthat was built around 140 hours of classroom instruction in the school <br/>\nyear, only 80 percent of that time is available. School events have been <br/>\ncut.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, club activities are over-emphasized. In the sports clubs, <br/>\nwinning is considered everything. Training is continuous, the only breaks <br/>\nare for summer&#39;s Obon and New Year&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 10 percent of the kids in the grade I teach can read almost no <br/>\nkanji at all. Those are the kids who cut classes, or when they do show <br/>\nup, cause trouble. You can&#39;t hold the lessons down to their level without <br/>\nboring the rest of the class. One way to save the public school system <br/>\nmight be to organize separate classes for advanced, intermediate and <br/>\nslower students.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher, 37, at a junior high school in Nara Prefecture:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe public junior high school where I work is in an area where private <br/>\njunior high schools are especially popular.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the summer holidays we had lecturers come in to help us prepare <br/>\nfor the new, somewhat lighter curriculum being introduced in 2002.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the local cram schools were busy handing out sample <br/>\nend-of-term tests to their students. The samples basically came from <br/>\ntests we had given in past years.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven supposing students get good marks on these test, can we say they <br/>\nhave really benefitted from the exercise? Or does it merely harm those <br/>\nkids who don&#39;t attend cram schools?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, schools are being asked to provide an education rich in <br/>\nexperience; on the other, there&#39;s the prevailing view that marks are <br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a contradiction here. As long as the marking system and senior <br/>\nhigh school entrance exams remain what they are, I doubt that change is <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2000 Asahi Shimbun</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13630,"nextTopicId":13636}}
