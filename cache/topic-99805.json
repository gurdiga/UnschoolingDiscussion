It <br/>\nwas on after Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, which always moves  me to tears, <br/>\nso I watch it.  I thought I would search for something else  when Wife Swap <br/>\ncame on, but they pulled me in.  It&#39;s where two families  switch mothers for a <br/>\ncouple of weeks to see what happens.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe one mom was the perfectionist mother who cleaned her house for 5 hours  <br/>\nEVERY day.  The other mom, well, she was absolutely GREAT, until she lost  it <br/>\nat the end and said she hated the other mom.  I kept expecting her to  say that <br/>\nher kids don&#39;t go to school, that they&#39;re unschoolers.  I couldn&#39;t  tell what <br/>\nthe school situation was, though.  She didn&#39;t clean, she  didn&#39;t cook (the <br/>\ndad it all).  She let her kids do whatever they wanted and  they had fun with <br/>\nher and there were always extra kids there, playing guitar and  everything else. <br/>\n They also had 25 pets, including groundhogs and a  kangaroo and birds and <br/>\ncats and lots of other things.  Most of the pets had  the run of the house, and <br/>\nso you can imagine.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSome of the comments that the teenage boys made were VERY telling, and it  <br/>\nwas such an example of respectful parenting (on the one unschooly-ish mom&#39;s  <br/>\npart).<br/>\n <br/>\nThe teenager from the perfectionist&#39;s mom kept saying, &quot;We never  talk.&quot;  &quot;We <br/>\nspend time alone in seperate parts of the house.&quot;  The  woman had put lists <br/>\nall over the house about what the other mom was supposed to  do (including <br/>\ncleaning the house 5 hours a day), and this boy had written on the  list on his <br/>\ndoor &quot;Get me a cute kitten.&quot;  So, of course, the other mom went  right out and <br/>\ngot the boy a cat!  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe fun mom&#39;s teenager said, &quot;You made all these changes without consulting  <br/>\nme.  I&#39;m not fine with this.&quot;  And, &quot;These animals are part of our  family.  <br/>\nYou can&#39;t get rid of them.&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll the perfectionist mom did for the other family is clean the house AND  <br/>\nshe got them a dining table so they could have dinner together.  (Besides  <br/>\nputting 22 of the pets with a sitter for a couple of weeks, without  asking.)  She <br/>\ninsulted the father and told him he wasn&#39;t a parent, but a  &quot;friend&quot; to their <br/>\nkids.  She made him put the 2 yo to bed at 8:00 p.m., and  of course she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t sleepy and cried her eyes out.  To his credit he let  her out of the bed and <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t happen again.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy the end of the show, the uptight family was having food fights in the  <br/>\nkitchen with the fun mom, and the dad, who had been required to play his jazz  <br/>\nguitar with headphones on because his wife always insisted on quiet, got up in a <br/>\n restuarant and played his guitar with the band.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThat woman was SUCH a great influence on the uptight family.

It seems to be arbitrary limit <br/>\nsetting. Perhaps the context would change the impression. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Jayn has some toys or dvd&#39;s that for some reason of her own she does not<br/>\nwant to share that day, I put them out of sight. Sometimes the visitor<br/>\nremembers the item and asks for it so I say something like the above<br/>\nstatement, rather than saying &quot;Jayn doesn&#39;t want you to use that&quot; or<br/>\nanything unkind. The principle at work is Jayn&#39;s choice of ownership, and<br/>\nnot forcing sharing. Believe me, we have enough stuff in our house that no<br/>\nvisitor would be completely bereft of any interesting toys just because a<br/>\ncouple have been designated &quot;special&quot; that day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI no longer feel any need to query Jayn as to her reasons behind wanting<br/>\nthings put up, although I am sometimes surprised by her becoming unusually<br/>\npossessive of certain items. It could look arbitrary to a third party I<br/>\nsuppose, but I know that Jayn has a real reason in her mind for wanting to<br/>\nseparate something from general usage. I follow her lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
