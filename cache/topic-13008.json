I&#39;m picking up on this country \nthread...I want soo much to move farther away from the city...we were a ways \naway, until this area became the development capital.&nbsp; All 5 acre plots \nbeing sold out for large 224,000$ particle board houses &amp; condos..with No \nland...what a profit, but what a loss for the community..soon there will be no \nwild places for the kiddies in the area to explore in, and they will all be \nplaying in the street, instead.&nbsp; I wish to have&nbsp; a little farm, out in \nthe country where we can have a little peace &amp; quiet....grow our garden, and \ncare for our animals.&nbsp; 3 dogs, 2 cats 2 birds, 2 fish, and a wonderful \ngoat..oh yah....and 3 silkworms...one about to emmerge from his cocoon.&nbsp; I \ndislike the hustle &amp; bustle, and want my son to learn&nbsp;a quality of \nlife, aside from integrating into a fast moving society.......my motto is find \nyour self, your skills, your dreams&amp; passions...then offer them to the \nworld.......not be given a skill ..be given the self you are expected to be, and \nthen have no choice but to integrate with what you&#39;ve been given.....without \nyour deepest hopes &amp; dreams, and the natural skills you&#39;ve been born with , \nand learned to fulfill them......life has little meaning, in my opinion.&nbsp; \nThe world is such a backwards place.....be like everyone else.....seems the \ngoal.....despite their best efforts to say you are all unique..but fullfilling \nthose unique personality fluxes........is not their job....and alot of things \nfall under, well that&#39;s not my job......if we could all just do the job that \ncomes naturally to us using the skills we are best at....we would all find the \nperfect place.&nbsp; It&#39;s a shame all this brainwashing, stripping of spirit, \nand seperation of family, manipulation.&nbsp; I hear this lady last night on \nOprah...they were covering the topic of letting go of your children when they go \noff to college...how important it was to let go, so you could be your own \nindividual person, how healthy it was for you to do so....how your relationship \nSHOULD change so they can go off into the world, and you should do some \nvolunteer work to cope with it.....Now I&#39;m not saying some of what she said \nwasn&#39;t true.....but the part of reinventing yourslef...find something else to \ndo...you&#39;ve moved beyond being a Mother get a new carreer stuff, was \ninsulting.&nbsp; Being a Mother is something you never really stop doing, once \nit is a part of who you are.&nbsp; And the natural transition from Mother used \nto be to GRandMother.....I heard no mention of this....just a start all over \nagain attitude.....ofcourse ineviteably kids grow up, and often find doing there \nown thing is somewhere other than , where you are at, but not all the time, and \nthat doesn&#39;t change the strength or end the need for a MOther.&nbsp; I know \nthis.....the norm of this society to seperate from their families so readily, is \nabsurd to me..there is nothing more warming than the home of close family..and \nit is NOT natural to seperate to such degrees, in my opinion.&nbsp; I think it \nhad alot to do with the Tough Love era....where you abandon the one that causes \nyou stress.....this is now accepteable.&nbsp; (just when they need you \nmost)&nbsp; I haven&#39;t had my Mother since I was 15..when I was married for the \nfirst time...it was if this is your choice get out, and stay out....and that&#39;s \nthe way it was.....my relationship with my parents because of extreme distance, \nand long periods of non communication.....has all but shriveled away.....I have \ntried to express my desire to rekindle some type of relationship, but them being \nin Florida, and me being in Washington...conveniently keeps us apart.&nbsp; We \nspeak once about every six months..how&#39;s the weather stuff.......and send gifts \non holidays..but who told these people that once someone leaves their \nhome...they no longer need the relationship , care &amp; love of a , and \ncommunication with their Mother &amp; Father.&nbsp; I do alot of things \ndifferently than they did...for many reasons....I still respect &amp; Love them \ndeeply......the world seems so Backwards to me....priorities are \njumbled......often we feel we are the only ones who see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you \nknow what ...that&#39;s ok..we&#39;ll teach our children to see it, and do what we feel \nis healthiest, happiest, and mose fulfilling for us, and not give a damn what \nthe rest of the world thinks.&nbsp; The best way to teach someone is by action, \nand dedication, and from leanring from your mistakes..or in&nbsp;some cases the \nmistakes  of others.</font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Michelle, Dana &amp;
