Yes, FREE!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have hosted several foreign exchange students.  One of them, a boy from<br/>\nMacedonia, lived with us for high school and then came back outside the<br/>\nexchange program and lived with us for two years of college.  He started at<br/>\na community college and after getting an Associate&#39;s Degree last spring,<br/>\nstarted at the University of Oklahoma this fall.  We love him and he&#39;s a<br/>\nterrific young man...and very smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe paid for his first year at Community College, but during that next year<br/>\none of his honors professors was really impressed by him and asked him if he<br/>\ncould APPLY FOR A SCHOLARSHIP ON HIS BEHALF.  He didn&#39;t have to do a<br/>\nthing--the professor filled it all out and all he did was sign his name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got that Regents Scholarship that paid for his last year at community<br/>\ncollege and full tuition, books, and quite a few living expenses for his<br/>\nnext 3 years at the U. of OK.  He&#39;ll be able to finish his bachelor&#39;s degree<br/>\nand one year of his master&#39;s degree on that scholarship.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd before he&#39;d finished one semester at OU, he got an internship (through<br/>\nthe university, but at a private company) and they&#39;ve already asked him to<br/>\nstay on until he graduates....at which time he&#39;s hoping/planning that they<br/>\nwill pay for his master&#39;s program.  (His degree will be in business or<br/>\nfinance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow.....this guy is a *wonderful* guy--part of our family--and has *all* it<br/>\ntakes to be very successful in life.  But it does still bug me just a bit<br/>\nthat he&#39;s getting all this money for college when he or his parents haven&#39;t<br/>\npaid a penny in state or federal taxes.  (His earning are tax-exempt...at<br/>\nleast they were last year.)  Here I am worried (when I think about it!)<br/>\nabout how I&#39;m going to pay for college for my 3 and he&#39;s going to college<br/>\nfor free.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can look at the flip side, too.....Macedonia is a struggling economy in<br/>\nthe midst of a very unstable region.  Helping this young man now may make a<br/>\ndifference to their economy--and ours--in the future.  And, no matter where<br/>\nhe&#39;s from, he is a deserving young man and will give back much to society.<br/>\nStill....<br/>\n<br/>\nI also place foreign exchange students, so I&#39;ve worked with dozens over the<br/>\nlast few years.  I can tell you that almost *EVERYWHERE* (but particularly<br/>\nin poorer countries), they have a misconception that they can come to the US<br/>\nand get a free college education.  It&#39;s really not true.  I have seen<br/>\nseveral kids who *did* get a free education, but it really is *not* easy.<br/>\nThe kids who come are often (not always) outstanding kids, so sometimes they<br/>\ncan get scholarships for particular things they&#39;re good at.  But WAY more<br/>\noften they find that it&#39;s just not that easy.  Unfortunately, one story<br/>\nabout a kid like our Macedonian exchange student really makes the rounds<br/>\n&quot;back home&quot; and the story grows with each telling.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably a dozen of his friends came here the same year he did intending to<br/>\ngo to college in the US.  Two of them are still here, but neither of them<br/>\nwas able to get any money at all for college.  The others gave up when they<br/>\nfound out that college wasn&#39;t free and/or they were too homesick to stay.<br/>\nOne friend still has delusions that he&#39;s going to work for Bill Gates and<br/>\n&quot;get rich quick&quot;.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, I place German students all the time and I don&#39;t think its true that<br/>\ntheir country will pay for them to go to college here....at least I&#39;ve never<br/>\nheard of it and don&#39;t personally know any German exchange students who went<br/>\nto college here.  Their country won&#39;t even pay for all of them to go to<br/>\ncollege--in fact, in most other countries college is free only to the very<br/>\nfew &quot;smartest&quot; kids and quite expensive for the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to write about the Macedonian public school system for you all.<br/>\nI will later today or tomorrow.  It&#39;s very interesting and an improvement in<br/>\nmany ways to what we have here.
