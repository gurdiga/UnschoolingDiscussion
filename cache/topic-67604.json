So no one was bumped out of their <br/>\n&quot;place&quot; in the family.  Believe me, they all get on each other&#39;s nerves, but <br/>\neach time it looked like they were possibly going home all my children were <br/>\nheartbroken.  I also think, that my kids are awesome and are just the type of <br/>\nyoung adults that are capable of putting other people first and realizing <br/>\nthat some kids are a heck of a lot less fortunate than we are.  I also try to <br/>\ngive them alone time with me,...sometimes I will take the girls shopping <br/>\nalone with me, or something like that.  And a lot of freedom and time away <br/>\nfrom home (spending the night at friends, going to the movies, etc) as a <br/>\nbreak from the other kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFoster care and adoption is a full time job, it turns your life upside down, <br/>\nand should never be taken lightly.  I don&#39;t believe most people becoming <br/>\nfoster parents are prepared for how hard it is.  Because of this, many foster <br/>\nparents who cannot handle a kid, pass them along to another family, or a <br/>\nshelter, or an institution.  This probably does as much damage to the kids as <br/>\nthe abuse or neglect they suffered.  In Sandra&#39;s tape on peaceful parenting <br/>\nshe talks about kids having to feel safe in their home to learn.  Can you <br/>\nimagine the ultimate &quot;unsafe&quot; feeling of being be removed from a family, <br/>\nschool, community, at the drop of a hat?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, there are NEVER enough good foster homes...NEVER.  So if <br/>\nyour heart is in the right place, and you truly want more children, and <br/>\nunderstand the hardships you may face, then by all means, look into it.  We <br/>\nare with a private agency that gives us much more support.  The monthly <br/>\nstipend is almost double what the state pays also, which always helps.  In <br/>\nall 50 states, I believe, if a foster parent adopts a child now, the monthly <br/>\nallowance is not taken away, it continues until the child is 18 or done with <br/>\ncollege.  I believe this is one of the more brilliant things our government <br/>\nhas done :o) <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139549710,"authorName":"Olga","from":"&quot;Olga&quot; &lt;britcontoo@...&gt;","profile":"britcontoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [was) special needs:Adoption","postDate":"1052157610","msgId":67748,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI5NjhyYStlajRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4YS4xOTc2ZjFiZC4yYmU3YTllMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67746,"nextInTopic":67757,"prevInTime":67747,"nextInTime":67749,"topicId":67604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Nancy, I think I just erased my post, so hopefully this does not go through twice!

BTW I doubt that anyone here<br/>\nwould agree with the label of &quot;late reader&quot; given the description of<br/>\nyour son&#39;s activities including typing his own name and seeking out<br/>\nbooks for enjoyment. &quot;Slow learner&quot; is a label used by schools as a<br/>\nconvenient distinction also. The great thing about unschooling is the<br/>\nletting go of all these labels.  Also, the hard thing about unschooling<br/>\nis letting go of all these labels, even in your own thinking -<br/>\nespecially in your own thinking! I guarantee that you and he will still<br/>\nneed to deschool after two years(?) of  it.

I am interested in hearing how unschooling works for your son.  I have had doubts about whether Ryan will learn without some kind of teaching.  We were unschoolers until he was 6, when we got the diagnosis.  It took us a few months, but we eventually decided to try school.  At the time his behavior at home was difficult and it was a bit of a relief to have a respite.  He is so much more mature now, and I&#39;m have long tired of the schedules, the arbitrary homework (which is still very minimal as he is in first grade), the competition and &quot;socialization&quot; of public school.  I also have a &quot;typical&quot; daughter who is 10 and has never been to traditional school.  It&#39;s been hard to justify believing that school is good for Ryan when I wouldn&#39;t send Chloe there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m wondering what sort of challenges your son is facing.  For Ryan, his biggest challenge is language.  He is talking like crazy, but still often misunderstood especially outside the family.  I think he will be able to learn to read, but it will take a while longer.  Luckily, he absolutely loves books and looks at them for hours sometimes.  This morning he was up early and I found him &quot;reading&quot; Go Dog Go.  It was so cool to see him saying the words from memory (not exactly but a good representation). .  I think that learning to read is the most important thing for him because he enjoys books so much.  I always knew he would be a late reader so that doesn&#39;t worry me.  I am a little worried about his lack of math skills (he can rote count but doesn&#39;t seem to get one to one correspondence).  Handwriting is a major challenge, so I will make keyboarding available to him when he wants it.  He has done some of this at school and he likes to send emails to grandparents, but of course he can&#39;t spell, so I have been doing the typing until we get to his name which he can do.  I feel that anything else he will acquire when he&#39;s ready and interested.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone out there have any tips for us?  I have read a lot of the posts at unschooling.com and a Sandra&#39;s website on special needs.  Can I really just let go with a child who is a slow learner?   Thanks for any advice!  Kristin<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nWell, thank YOU, Mary, Sandra, Jennifer and others!<br/>\nNot to be dramatic, but it&#39;s almost like I have been brainwashed (my son, <br/>\ntoo)?<br/>\nAnd yes, my 14-yr-old son has special needs (autism).  He does quite well <br/>\nmost of the time.  I have an 11-yr-old &quot;typical&quot; son, which makes me laugh to <br/>\nuse ;these labels, because of course he is special to me in his own way, too! <br/>\n You know, in so many words, we just want our life back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate everyone&#39;s input,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67708,"nextTopicId":67387}}
