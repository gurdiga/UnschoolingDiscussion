This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children.

My oldest has never homeschooled and<br/>\nis in a self paced gifted high school program (rather like unschooling<br/>\nor at least as close to it as a PS can get)<br/>\nWhen we first started (pulled them from PS for grades 1 & 2 ), we used<br/>\nunit studies since they were used to school work. We evolved over the<br/>\nnext year into unschooling.<br/>\nA typical day recently is about 20 min of math (totaly voluntary but mom<br/>\nis math phobic and whines sometimes to coax some math work), lots of<br/>\nreading (books, magazines, kids&#39; magazines, comic, newspapers), a little<br/>\nFrench for the youngest although the older one is now showing an<br/>\ninterest and pursuing it on his own. Responsibility for our puppy&#39;s<br/>\nschedule is an on going family affair. Some times they watch interesting<br/>\nprograms from Discovery Channel, TLC or PBS etc that I&#39;ve taped for them<br/>\nthe night before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time durring the week there is guaranteed to be craft/artsy stuff<br/>\nhappening.Today just happened to include pictures from Spiderman comics<br/>\nbeing trimmed up and used in a collage.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* worked on brushing up my German while the math stuff and the collage<br/>\nwas happening (parents can unschool too you know &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe garden beckons and I&#39;ll enlist volunteers to pull weeds and scoop<br/>\npoop.<br/>\nMy guys do their own laundry weekly.<br/>\nLibrary books of all kinds end up here too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy guys like to help with meals. Our youngest loves workbooks and will<br/>\ndo math and French on her own initiative. I do worry about our son<br/>\nthough because he needs to have things offered up to him as he, up until<br/>\nrecently had shown no ambition or much interest in anything except<br/>\npokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he is becomming more self motivated and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t push even<br/>\nwhen I was agonizing over his lack of interest in the world. I just keep<br/>\noffering things up and lately he has become more interested in languages<br/>\nand more serious reading endeavors (Star Wars books and Harry Potter<br/>\nstarted the *serious* reading frenzy he&#39;s enjoying).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a medium size keyboard with full size keys that is used when the<br/>\nfancy strikes them. The younger one says she is not ready to learn to<br/>\nread music yet and insists on puzzling out tunes by herself and playing<br/>\nthem by ear. Our son has made an effort to teach himself to read music<br/>\nand right now has put it aside but I know he intends return to it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey love the computer of course and play math and language games<br/>\nseveral times a week. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey bowl every Saturday from September to May and Samantha is in<br/>\nBrownies durring this time also.

Also, unschooling pretty much encompasses our lives, so all<br/>\ntopics touch on learning lives in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\n      When my children were the ages of yours   our lives looked like this.<br/>\nFix food, fix juice, play, fix food, watch videos, sing, dance, fix food...<br/>\ncollapse in bed at night.  :) Now that mine are older it still looks like<br/>\nthat, but I don&#39;t fix all the food.  Thank goodness!!<br/>\n<br/>\n      Why don&#39;t you ask us some questions about unschooling, give us a hint.<br/>\nWhere are you by the way? Maybe someone here is close to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome!<br/>\nLisaKK<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: bjackson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beckyjackson@...\">beckyjackson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 04, 2000 10:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need unschooling input!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but I<br/>\n&gt; have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with all<br/>\n&gt; the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with them.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might not<br/>\n&gt; feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; perspectives--especially from those of you with young children. Mine are<br/>\n5,<br/>\n&gt; 4, and 3. Thank you! --Becky<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; Failed tests, classes skipped, forgotten locker combinations.<br/>\n&gt; Remember the good &#39;ol days<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://click.egroups.com/1/4053/7/_/448294/_/960177638/\">http://click.egroups.com/1/4053/7/_/448294/_/960177638/</a><br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To Unsubscribe: mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9638,"nextTopicId":9680}}
