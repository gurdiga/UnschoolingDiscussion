What I try to<br/>\ndo, sometimes better than others, is to truly be in the moment with the kids<br/>\nwhen I AM with them, really focused, really attending.  Then about 3 hours a<br/>\nweek (I teach karate and help with the teen drama group) I am completely<br/>\nfocused on what I am doing, on just me, as a separate entity from my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that if I do not take some time for myself that I begin to resent<br/>\nthe kids and that is most certainly not fair to them.  I work to make sure<br/>\nthat the kids enjoy themselves during the times that I&#39;m gone (a fun<br/>\nbabysitter that likes walks and crafts or game time with dh).  So far, so<br/>\ngood.  It also helps that my oldest (12) adores her younger siblings and<br/>\nenjoys one-on-one time with them.
