Maybe the &#39;problem&#39; is <br/>\nreally just &#39;me&#39;, and how &#39;I&#39; see the situation ;o).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve made peace with the whole video game experience in our <br/>\nhousehold as far as length of time spent on video games, and even <br/>\nthe violence in video games, believing that if I trust my child to <br/>\nbe his own &#39;monitor&#39; in what he can personally be comfortable with, <br/>\nhe will make the right choices for himself....BUT...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he and dad play together, which is almost daily, my husband <br/>\nbecomes a &#39;child&#39; during play, and the two of them can become fairly <br/>\nverbally abusive to each other during game play, and get VERY LOUD <br/>\nin their verbal attacks on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve talked about this so much, and are each aware of each other&#39;s <br/>\nthoughts and feelings on it, but I&#39;m interested in hearing other&#39;s <br/>\nviews on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur child doesn&#39;t have siblings to play with every day, so my <br/>\nhusband feels he is playing the role of &#39;sibling&#39; during thier <br/>\nplaytime, whether it be video games, wrestling, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son has friends that he plays with on a regular basis, and I <br/>\nbelieve he learns what he needs to learn about getting along with <br/>\nother kids, without dad having to become a &#39;child&#39; and engage in <br/>\nsuch childish behaviors....<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if this activity makes it difficult for our son to &#39;know&#39; <br/>\nwhen dad is being &#39;dad&#39; or when he&#39;s being &#39;sibling&#39;....for <br/>\ninstance, when dad is ready to &#39;quit&#39;, our son doesn&#39;t...he will <br/>\ncontinue to try to incite arguements, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve actually sought out counseling for this, but haven&#39;t been <br/>\nentirely honest with the counselors, because the counselors I&#39;ve <br/>\ncome across don&#39;t even think our son should be spending so much time <br/>\non video games, shouldn&#39;t be exposed to the violence of the games, <br/>\nand blah, blah, blah...in other words, I &#39;feel out&#39; the counselors, <br/>\nand decide before I even get into discussing the conflict, that the <br/>\ncounselor will have the &#39;usual&#39; conventional opinions regarding kids <br/>\nand video games, so I don&#39;t get any further in resolving the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other issues at play here that make it difficult for me to <br/>\nreach a peaceful end to this conflict.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one thing, my husband resents all the time I spend with our son, <br/>\nall the energies I put into raising him, which means less time for <br/>\nhim and me.  Which leads me to believe that he is &#39;using&#39; the <br/>\nopportunity to let some of his frustrations out on our son....<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s the issue of our son being so much better at video <br/>\ngames than dad, that our son gets VERY annoyed at dad&#39;s lack of <br/>\nexpertise, and starts yelling at dad for being so &#39;stupid&#39;....(our <br/>\nson has been playing since he was 4 (he is now 8), and is very <br/>\nskilled, and can do a lot of it while at the same time, carrying on <br/>\na conversation with someone else about something entirely unrelated <br/>\nto the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they are playing, I often go in and put a stop to it, because <br/>\nit has become too verbally abusive IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband was raised with two older brothers who overpowered him a <br/>\nlot and, in my opinion, was very abusive to him.  But much of what <br/>\nhappend in his life, he sees as &#39;boys being boys&#39;.  Some of it he <br/>\nrealizes was abusive, but most of it he attributes to just &#39;being <br/>\nboys&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main reason all of this concerns me so greatly, is that I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant our son growing up feeling &#39;overpowered&#39; by ANYONE for ANY <br/>\nREASON.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough our son holds his own in conflicts with dad, and treats his <br/>\ndad like another kid, I&#39;m not so sure all of this is healthy.  I <br/>\nknow my son feels great frustration at times because his dad is so <br/>\nmuch bigger and stronger than he is, and he knows that if push comes <br/>\ndown to shove, he will lose.  On the other hand, I guess he needs to <br/>\nknow that he WILL lose sometimes in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband normally doesn&#39;t &#39;overpower&#39; our son, unless our son has <br/>\nbecome &#39;unmanageable&#39;, but *I* think the &#39;unmanageable&#39; comes from <br/>\nfrustration in their relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other issues involved, and I have plenty of other thoughts <br/>\non it, but this is getting rather long. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean to &#39;use&#39; this list as a &#39;counseling&#39; experience, but I <br/>\ndo need advice and greatly appreciate other&#39;s views on this.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any input!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94588,"nextTopicId":94688}}
