I&#39;ve been vegetarian for 20 <br/>\nodd years and vegan on and off during that. I&#39;d planned to raise the <br/>\nkids as veggie mainly just for the convenience but it turned out that <br/>\nthey all had dairy intolerances that led to terrible excema and <br/>\nasthma. It took me 3 years to figure it out even though I knew I got <br/>\nsick if I had too much dairy. (Bar of choc is OK, lump of cheese is <br/>\nnot).<br/>\nNow that they are older we are gradually introducing dairy although <br/>\nmy eldest has said she wont eat it. As I&#39;m vegan again I respect <br/>\nher decision. My two boys will eat some cheese but it must be <br/>\nEnglish cheese, not American. (Imported cheese is very expensive. <br/>\nIt&#39;s like each bit had its own seat on the plane. Sigh).<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly enough I did develop a B12 deficiency severe enough to <br/>\ncause neurological damage but that was while I was eating dairy <br/>\nand taking supplements. It was caused by the antacids I take <br/>\nwhich block absorption of B12.<br/>\nThe Doctor was so disappointed as he was ant-vegan and was all <br/>\nset to rant at me :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different.

They have to be able to choose it for themselves and to<br/>\nknow no one will judge them if they make a different choice.  Fortunately<br/>\nthere are a lot of people in his life he admires who are meat eaters and<br/>\nso I don&#39;t think he associates it with some kind of moral deficiency,<br/>\nlike he might if he only knew vegans.&lt;g&gt;  (We are an uppity bunch!)  I am<br/>\nthe only vegan he knows, and his dad eats meat occasionally, so I think<br/>\nhe sees a balance.   I think he&#39;s comfortable making his own choices too,<br/>\nso hopefully this issue will not be the most difficult one in his life.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s young enough still that the concept of eating &quot;someone&quot; else is<br/>\nrevolting to him, personally.  But those views rarely stay with a person<br/>\nforever.  We all grow and change.  My only hope is that he&#39;s not afraid<br/>\nto be himself, whoever that turns out to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"vegan diet","postDate":"1033815192","msgId":45403,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2ZC4xMzZkOTMxYi4yYWQwMWU5OEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45417,"prevInTime":45402,"nextInTime":45404,"topicId":45403,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/4/02 4:38:22 PM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165874363\">In a message dated 10/4/02 4:38:22 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Ren, why don&#39;t you just say what you mean!  = )  <br/>\n I just love reading your posts because you never pussy foot around.
