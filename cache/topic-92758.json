She is a devout Christian, supports president Bush and the <br/>\nBible. We totally, completely disagree and we both know it. But we <br/>\nlove each other like sisters. She doesn&#39;t try to change me, and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t try to change her, we ACCEPT each other with all our glorius <br/>\ndifferences and focus on the things we both love...which is a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re meeting up with other unschoolers downtown, one family very <br/>\nnew age, another Mom is atheist with children that range from belief <br/>\nin paranormal to one that leans to Buddhist. Our homeschool group is <br/>\nimmensely diverse. We have friends that are public school <br/>\nsupporters, one great friend I have is a teacher. She&#39;s also a total <br/>\nhippy mama and I love her dearly. The kids that hang out with us are <br/>\nmostly public schooled, they also happen to be mostly African <br/>\nAmerican. I have friends that are ardent vegans, non-violent, new <br/>\nage types. I have friends that are conservative, friends that range <br/>\nfrom lawyers to doctors to artists to writers and those that serve <br/>\nin the military. One of our favorite unschool families is serving in <br/>\nTurkey right now, adamantly opposed to Bush and the war, yet serving <br/>\nin the military and living joyful unschooling lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point?<br/>\nMy life and my childrens lives are extremely rich because of the <br/>\ndiverse group of friends we have. My children have learned to try <br/>\nand see issues from many different viewpoints. They are very <br/>\ncomfortable around MANY types of people with all their varying <br/>\nbeliefs.<br/>\nWe learn so much from all these diverse friendships. Another cool <br/>\nthing is when a topic comes up, we always have a friend to call to <br/>\nget more information. From metal sculpture to tie dye, to computer <br/>\nprogramming, laws, medical information and building. We can easily <br/>\njoin drumming circles, visit the EPA, record music in a studio or <br/>\nget help with our computer. That&#39;s just a small sampling of the <br/>\nskills that our friendships surround us with.<br/>\n<br/>\nTolerance is important. <br/>\nI don&#39;t tolerate idiocy or stupidity very well. But I can tolerate <br/>\nother views, as long as they aren&#39;t trying to shove something down <br/>\nmy throat repeatedly.<br/>\nIt would behoove you to learn tolerance for your child&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92655,"nextTopicId":92672}}
