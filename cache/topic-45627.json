They can do that for hours and hours and would <br/>\nlove to do it several days a week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t too many kids in our neighborhood. There is a girl <br/>\nacross the street and my daughter said she&#39;s looking for a way to <br/>\nmeet her.  Hopefully that will work out, because she might be allowed <br/>\nto play after school sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut...It&#39;s hard to find families whose kids are allowed to play that <br/>\noften.  There&#39;s usually limits on how often they can just spend the <br/>\nday playing.

We both belong to Life long learners of GA. We both are open in our unschooling approach. I sometimes find the discussions of curriculum and the idea that mom feels uncomfortable bringing kids to the park that day because they hadn&#39;t finished their math a bit silly and mind-numbing....but most of the women in this group are loving, gentle, and in general people I can easily get along with, if not form life-long friendships with. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel this group is good for me to be around others that homeschool, even if most of them school at home.
