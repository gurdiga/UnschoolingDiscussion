He was wearing <br/>\nboots, canvas cargo pants, a long-sleeved t-shirt (heavy) with another <br/>\nt-shirt over.  His friend was wearing nearly nothing.  Cropped tank top, <br/>\nhip-hugger short-shorts.   It made an odd combo, but I didn&#39;t say a word, <br/>\nbecause who knows, in New Mexico, in Spring.  They were both probably within <br/>\ncomfort-range.  I can&#39;t &quot;know&quot; what they need or should wear.  Now that my <br/>\nyoungest is eleven, I&#39;ll remind people about taking sun screen or a jacket <br/>\nsometimes, but if I press I&#39;m often wrong, so since they&#39;ll need to be making <br/>\nthose decisions themselves long after I&#39;m gone, I just state my case, say <br/>\n&quot;Whatever you want&quot; and try not to worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a big kid and teen, I would go out in the snow barefooted to get <br/>\nthe newspaper.

Today I saw a delightful event that <br/>\n<br/>\nreminded me why respectful parenting is so great. We are having another dump of snow. We thought it was spring <br/>\n<br/>\nbut alas we were fooled. Anyway Noah saw it and wanted to go see it. He was in his pyjamas still and had on his <br/>\n<br/>\nrunners and no coat. I immediately thought about dressing him up but realised he would if he wanted. He didn&#39;t <br/>\n<br/>\nwant to so hopped out to the snow and delightfully walked up and down watching it go on his shoes and make <br/>\n<br/>\npatterns. He giggled and bounced the entire time. He had so much fun. When he was cold he came in.
