I have looked at the homeschool laws for Arkansas and this is what I have found.  <br/>\n     <br/>\n     &lt;&lt;&lt;   6-15-504. Home-schooled students - Achievement tests - Enrollment or reenrollment in local schools.<br/>\n      <br/>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n       <br/>\n     <br/>\n     (a)  Each student enrolled in a home school program who is considered to be at a grade level, or no more than two (2) years beyond the normal age for the appropriate grade, for which the state mandates norm-referenced tests for public school students shall be tested using a nationally recognized achievement test selected by the State Board of Education.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following question was answered on the FAQ page of the AR Dept. of Education site........<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;12. Are home school students required to test?<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Home school students are required to take the<br/>\n<br/>\nsame norm-referenced test at the same grade levels as<br/>\n<br/>\npublic school students. Home school students who are<br/>\n<br/>\nin grades 5, 7, and 10 at the beginning of each school<br/>\n<br/>\nyear will take the required test in the fall. Currently the<br/>\n<br/>\nStanford 9 is administered to both home school and<br/>\n<br/>\npublic school students in September. Home school<br/>\n<br/>\nstudents in grades other than 5, 7, and 10 will not be<br/>\n<br/>\ntested by the state.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I found regarding refusal to test.....<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(e)(1)  Any student that refuses to participate in the testing program required by this section shall be subject to the applicable Arkansas laws regarding truancy. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what the law says about truancy......... <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;(5)(A)  Whenever a student exceeds the number of excessive unexcused absences provided for in the district&#39;s or the state board&#39;s student attendance policy, the school district or the adult education program shall notify the prosecuting authority and the community truancy board, and the student&#39;s parents, guardians, or persons in loco parentis shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount as a juvenile court or other court of competent jurisdiction, as authorized under subdivision (a)(6)(A) of this section, may prescribe but not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500) plus costs of court and any reasonable fees assessed by the court.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this information just makes me even more confused about what I will do next year.  It seems pretty clear that if I put my son in 5th grade next year they will expect him to test.  I am leaning towards keeping him in 4th next year and then promoting him to 6th the following year.  <br/>\nI am not quite sure how the truancy law would be applied to refusal to test.  It only talks about unexcused absences.......my child will be present in my homeschool daily......??  <br/>\nIf anyone has had some experience in this area I would sure appreciate the additional advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber in AR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41485,"nextTopicId":40822}}
