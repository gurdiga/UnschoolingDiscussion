I asked him, &quot;But <br/>\nwhat if they never learn their times tables?&quot;  He gently reminded me that I <br/>\ncan&#39;t recite my times tables, either.  I was a good student, liked school, <br/>\ngot through college (with a science degree), graduate school and law school, <br/>\nand I still can&#39;t tell you what anything above the 5 x 10 is without really <br/>\nthinking about it.  He says it&#39;s kind of like those people who can&#39;t tell <br/>\ntheir left from their right.  But you know what?  Besides thinking at various <br/>\ntimes that I must have a screw loose since I just can&#39;t remember what 9 X 7 <br/>\nor 6 X 8 is, my handy pocket calculator does me just fine.  And when the <br/>\ncalculator isn&#39;t handy, I can usually come up with the right answer if I take <br/>\na minute and think about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCarron<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12125,"nextTopicId":12134}}
