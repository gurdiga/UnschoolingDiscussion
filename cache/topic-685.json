He hasn&#39;t been interested in books with just text,<br/>\neven though he can read very well. I  think it is because he is very visual<br/>\nand likes to see images while he hears a story. Just for grins I bought a<br/>\nnon-picture book last week while we were at the bookstore: &quot;The Mouse and<br/>\nthe Motorcycle&quot;. I chose it because it appealed to me and I thought he<br/>\nmight enjoy it also. One night, before bed, I asked if anyone (my husband<br/>\nand son) would like to hear some of the book I just bought. I started<br/>\nreading it out loud and was surprised that everyone was enjoying hearing<br/>\nit. We read quite a few chapters. Of course we don&#39;t read it every night.<br/>\nBut some nights my son will ask me to read him a chapter; it&#39;s an on-going<br/>\nproject. If my son hadn&#39;t been interested in hearing it, I would have put<br/>\nit away until he was ready, if ever. I guess I can&#39;t resist the temptation<br/>\nto introduce new things, but I&#39;m learning to back off if the idea doesn&#39;t<br/>\nfly.

She was also able to listen to story tapes such as Jim Weiss&#39; Fairy Tale Favorites in Story and Song very early on.  Among her friends who are the same age (6) about half are interested in listening to a story with no pictures, while the others insist on pictures every few pages at least.  She is just beginning to read the very early readers now with no reading lessons at all.  BTW, she has an excellent auditory memory which is really wonderful.  She has the Winnie the Pooh books on tape and last year she could recite from memory one of the stories with all the grammar and inflections in the appropriate places.  I think this is a distinct advantage to reading later rather than earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, on the other hand, who has a speech delay and is completely the opposite of his sister is 4 3/4 and can hardly look at a picture book with a plot.  His favorites are books with pictures of heavy machinery and we just talk about the pictures.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry too much about your son.  There are lots of wonderful picture books with lovely stories.  If your son is destined to be an early reader, there shouldn&#39;t be any need to teach him.  He&#39;ll probably learn it on his own.  Let him lead the way.  If you really hate the Big Bird type of books, maybe they could secretly disappear and be replaced with ones you will enjoy reading again and again.  Perhaps you could try a storytelling tape geared for 3 year olds and just have it play while he is playing with blocks or something.  He probably will absorb more than you think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to say about the workbooks.  I have the same bias against them that you do and have yet to see any that inspire creativity.  We just provide the kids with lots of paper, colored pencils, crayons and markers and let them do their thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"下川　誉志彦","from":"=?ISO-2022-JP?B?GyRCMjxAbiEhTUA7VkknGyhC?=  &lt;RXP10715@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"hHeKogEUSdZoCPvd0u44w0X01uojR9fOZegWzOCpxbhyXGmRdqj2sygYYAheZtY2RZJGUWMhNOw3fTRNFA2ML1-MjAoufDUgfJaEhx9L31SLrsxNJ-YZIk9H--dflM2PtMS1LTulPSQi","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"reading and workbooks","postDate":"928731690","msgId":685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy42MC42ODUuOTU5MjY5NzM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":687,"prevInTime":684,"nextInTime":686,"topicId":685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My two year old LOVES work books.

Are there any workbooks out there for a two year old (he <br/>\nknows all his colors, numbers, shapes, and letters - upper and lower <br/>\ncase and what they sound like) that encourage creativity?  But even at <br/>\nthis age, he&#39;s coloring within the lines (though not neatly), and IMO is <br/>\ntoo rigid.  Of course, that may be just his personality (like my dad) - <br/>\nI&#39;m so laid back, I can&#39;t understand why he would rather spend half an <br/>\nhour in front of a workbook than go play outside (though he loves soccer <br/>\nand baseball and playing with the neighborhood kids when they get out of <br/>\nschool) or something fun.  So is there anything out there anybody would <br/>\nrecommend?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, at about what age do kids (I know every child is different, <br/>\nbut...) enjoy stories without pictures?  No matter how complicated the <br/>\nstory is, Mook (ds) enjoys it if it has pictures, but when I read even a <br/>\nsimple story without a colorful picture on every page (I like Mrs. <br/>\nPiggle-Wiggle stories and Winnie the Pooh), he gets bored.  Not that I <br/>\nexpect him to sit still for hours, but even a five minute story seems <br/>\nboring to him.  But if it has pictures, he&#39;ll sit with me and we&#39;ll <br/>\nread for over an hour - I get tired before he does, and I just have to <br/>\ndistract him with something else.  I just look forward to reading <br/>\nsomething other than &quot;Big Bird&#39;s Day on the Farm.&quot;  It may be nice to <br/>\njust teach him to read - sometimes he seems ready, sometimes he doesn&#39;t, <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t know how to do it.  Anybody have any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":733,"nextTopicId":728}}
