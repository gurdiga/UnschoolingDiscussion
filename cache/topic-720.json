Take however long to just<br/>\ntravel around the area, neighborhood/city. Go to the places that would<br/>\ninterest her or things you would like to share with her.  Spend time<br/>\nreading, cooking, whatever your day would entail and whatever follows her<br/>\ninterests. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, you could point out how all this was educational.  The biggest<br/>\nhurdle would probably be finding friends her age. So many children feel<br/>\nthat school is the only place to find friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*I* would also hold off on any curriculum unless she requested it.

Starting at this age (15 months and 29 months) looking at<br/>\nlearning from the Unschooling perspective, I will never have to adjust my<br/>\nthinking from having &quot;students&quot; in public school to having students of<br/>\ntheir own lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I will most probably have to deal with deschooling anyway, as the<br/>\nlittle girl we are trying to adopt is in Second grade in public school.
