I myself had never heard any","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-313982622\">I would like to thank you for the advice and the articles.  I have read them<br/>\nfully and feel deeply sorry for those poor parents.  I myself had never heard<br/>\nany controvery on this issue other than from child-centered parents, which I am<br/>\nnot, nor do I want to become.  I definately will be looking into the sites you<br/>\nrecommended.  This has definately sparked my curiousity.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my husband and I believe firmly in the teachings we learned in GKGW.  We<br/>\nhave only taken that class.  A friend of mine loaned me her book &#39;Preperation<br/>\nfor Parenting&#39;.  I have read only bits and peices out of it.  I have tried some<br/>\nof the feeding methods on my 2-1/2 month old and she is thriving fine.  But it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably due to the fact that she was a chunk to begin with and remains over the<br/>\n95 percentile in all: height/weight/head circ.  She has started sleeping at<br/>\nnight for longer periods of time, but not all the way till 8am.  I am not strict<br/>\nat all with what I have read in that book.  Although I certainly do not<br/>\nfeed-on-demand, I also know the sound of an &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; cry, and I will not<br/>\nhesitate to feed her even if it hasn&#39;t been the full amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, as with everything in life, one needs to take into context each<br/>\nindividual situation and go from there.  The Ezzo&#39;s repeat this continuously<br/>\nthroughout the course.  There is only one thing that I follow religiously (I<br/>\nhate that word) and that is my relationship with Jesus Christ.  Period.  Other<br/>\nthan that I take things as they come and use advice from here and there.  But I<br/>\nalways compare it to what Scripture has to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO NOT beat my kids, and I know no one was accusing me of this, but the Ezzo&#39;s<br/>\nalso do not tell anyone to do this.  There is a severe difference between<br/>\nbeating and spanking.  And, they teach spanking as a last resort punishment for<br/>\nwrong behavior.  The articles I read made it sound that at the slightest thing<br/>\nyour children do wrong you take out your club and beat them.  That is not what<br/>\nthey teach!    My husband and I learned a variety of ways to teach and train<br/>\nyour children to obey, yes, first time obedience.  For the non-christians out<br/>\nthere this will not mean anything to you, but for those of you who are the<br/>\nchild-parent relationship is the training ground on how obedient we are going to<br/>\nbe to God.  If we can&#39;t obey our parents the first time they speak, why would we<br/>\nobey a God we can&#39;t even see the first time He speaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the things said about the Ezzo&#39;s in the articles were about the<br/>\ndiscipline part of everything but they also have a lot of neat ideas on how to<br/>\nmake it easier for your children to obey.  Like the 5 minute warning.  It&#39;s used<br/>\nfor things like dinner.  Give your kids a 5 min. warning just to let them know<br/>\ndinner&#39;s in 5 min. pick up toys in 5min. and it&#39;s easier for them to wind down<br/>\nwhat they are doing and more likely they will obey when you say &quot;ok, time to<br/>\npick up/time for dinner&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that before anyone is to slam something they need to read it first and<br/>\nthen judge for themselves.  That is what I am going to do.  Since I have already<br/>\nread through the Ezzo&#39;s material I have the right to judge for myself and<br/>\nresearch on these issues and say good or bad what I think.  Again, thank you for<br/>\nthe insight that there was more to this than what I had heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving for Him,<br/>\nFaith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Roop0625@xxx.xxx","from":"Roop0625@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"FxCdcRXPxFU6ZONoTLnU0KtSxjGrI4v0YXJLksZ3dkjQpmyFpvY2BnwxB-lh_zaxKy7DLQAeeg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Just Say No to Ezzo WAS  Need advice","postDate":"939054207","msgId":3556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4yNDAuMzU1Ni45NTkyNjk3NDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3554,"nextInTopic":3567,"prevInTime":3555,"nextInTime":3557,"topicId":3545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 99-10-04 10:46:16 EDT, you write: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-271824735\">In a message dated 99-10-04 10:46:16 EDT, you write:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n I read half of his secular book, Babywise.
