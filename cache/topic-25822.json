IMO the child needs to feel ownership of his education and where it leads him/her. To constantly be led to this or that and expect to drink it up sorta defeats the purpose of unschooling. (IMO of course.) While I think there&#39;s a role that the parent needs to fulfill in exposing the kids to various things, there&#39;s a fine line in exposure and insisting that the child respond in any way to that exposure. <br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Wendy Silver","from":"&quot;Wendy Silver&quot; &lt;wew99@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"HCc7P_XJ4TeeF68ITc4o8dI4onzA-nBvKaygvbvl3CeqMqGXieiBf_lw5unyDkTcWEp1jgIFMYkaj_u6JeYd4RzNNcNTNW-l","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] why unschooling","postDate":"1000667162","msgId":25822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOGEwMWMxM2VlMiRhMGQ2MTQ0MCQyYzBkOGMxOEBzc3NuZXQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDA2MzI5MDEuMzk4LjI3NzI2LmwxMEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25840,"prevInTime":25821,"nextInTime":25823,"topicId":25822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I think a variety of educational approaches are nice to know about and one can gain useful information from them,  but I don t like to impose any ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1583646439\">Hello,<br/>\n   I think a variety of educational approaches are nice to know about and<br/>\none can gain useful information from them,  but I don&#39;t like to impose any<br/>\nparticular method on my kids, but rather take ideas from different<br/>\napproaches for reference and materials. Also, I think it is limiting when a<br/>\nteacher, parent, etc. does all of the initiation.<br/>\nI have even attempted to follow some formulas, but I would see what cool<br/>\nthings my kids would do without my input and interference. Months would go<br/>\nby with no math instruction, and my daughter would know more math concepts<br/>\nthan before.The same goes for all subjects, and now I try not to even think<br/>\nin terms of subjects.<br/>\nAt our house, asking nicely goes much further than demanding and following<br/>\nwith a threat-NOT that I don&#39;t catch myself doing that.<br/>\n No one has a specific job, if something is in my way, I will ask if they<br/>\nwould mind moving it, and sometimes they say, &quot;yes!&quot;. If they do say yes, I<br/>\nmove it myself-not usually a big deal anyway, and my alternative would be to<br/>\nmake a threat-&quot;move it or we are not going here, doing this, etc.&quot; The<br/>\n&quot;you&#39;d better do it or else&quot; stuff seems comparable to &quot;this will go on your<br/>\npermanent record!&quot; The threats start to seem meaningless . Kids begin to<br/>\nthink, &quot;so!&quot; and are then labeled rebellious.<br/>\nMy kids want to help me around the house, yard, etc more often than not<br/>\nwithout demands. Sometimes they get such a thrill by having everything look<br/>\ngreat, other times they could care less, so I pick up the slack. I never had<br/>\nchores when I was little, but I still managed to catch on how to clean. As a<br/>\nmatter of fact, when I got to be 11 or 12, I really wanted to do laundry and<br/>\ndishes, and it was then that I started fulfilling my great desires.<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25816,"nextTopicId":25847}}
