They attribute low test scores to management’s failure to direct \nits &quot;lowest level&quot; employees (i.e., the teachers) to induce achievement in \nstudents. In Texas, the remedy to this situation has been to create a management \nsystem that will change behavior, particularly the behavior of teachers, through \nincreased accountability. The means of holding teachers and administrators \naccountable is the average scores of each school’s children on the state’s \nstandardized test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, or &quot;TAAS.&quot; As our \nreport will show, this over-reliance on test scores has caused a decline in \neducational quality for those students who have the greatest educational \nneed.</p>\n<p>Texas, a state with a history of low educational achievement and low \ninvestment in public education, has put into place an accountability system that \nhinges on the testing of children. The test has high stakes consequences for the \nchildren: not passing the high school-level test is a bar to graduation \n(regardless of the student’s accomplishments and courses passed); and soon, \nscores on the reading section of the test will determine whether a child can be \npromoted from third to fourth grade.<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p></font><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"text1\"> The \nscores on the test are also used as the chief means of monitoring the \nperformance of teachers, principals, and schools. School-level aggregations of \nchildren’s scores are used to rate principals, schools, and even \nsuperintendents.\n<p>The rhetoric surrounding this accountability system is that it is raising \neducational quality. Politicians claim that this testing system is &quot;saving&quot; the \nTexas schools. The system is gaining national recognition as an exemplary \naccountability system, because scores on the state test have, in most districts, \nbeen rising. The system’s popularity is further bolstered by the idea that it \nmust be improving the education of Latino and African American children, since, \nin many parts of the state, their test scores are also rising. </p>\n<p>Before other states rush to copy the Texas system, it is important to look \nbehind the reported numbers. It is necessary to see the effects that the test \nand the testing system are having on the children and on what they are learning. \nIt is essential to examine the effects of this system of testing on teachers. \nAnd it is critical to analyze the effects of this system of testing on \nchildren’s lives.</p>\n<p>We present here our strong assessment that the TAAS system of testing is \nreducing the quality and quantity of education offered to the children of Texas. \nMost damaging are the effects of the TAAS system of testing on poor and minority \nyouth. </p>\n<p>Our analysis draws on emerging research on high stakes testing and on our \nindividual investigations. These include a longitudinal analysis of instruction \nwhen test-prep materials become the curriculum, a multi-year study of Latino \nchildren’s high school experiences, investigations of Latino elementary schools, \nand research in urban schools with predominantly Mexican American and African \nAmerican children (McNeil, 1988, 2000; Valenzuela, 1997, 1998, 1999). Our \ninvestigations have entailed the documentation of the effects of centralized \ntesting in Texas beginning with the Perot reforms of the 1980s and on through \nthe 1990s, when such tests were increasingly tied to &quot;high stakes&quot; for children \nand school personnel (McNeil, 1987, 2000). Our investigations have included \ninteractions over the past ten years with literally hundreds of public school \nteachers, representing all subjects and grades and a wide mix of urban and \nsuburban districts, whom we have encountered through research projects and the \nteacher enhancement and school reform programs at the Rice University Center for \nEducation. Our research required fieldwork in schools and classrooms and \nfrequent interactions with students, teachers, and administrators, whose voices \nand experiences are vital to capture. </p>\n<p>In essence, our investigations have permitted us to gather and triangulate \ndata from a variety of sources over a multi-year period. From these \ninvestigations, we understand that there are a wide variety of responses to the \nTAAS. However, those we report are the most characteristic among the many \nschools, teachers, and students included in our research. The effects of the \nTAAS, which we describe herein, represent strong, persistent trends emerging \nfrom the data. We are not describing isolated or aberrant cases. To the \ncontrary, we have unavoidably encountered this evidence in overabundance, and we \nhave encountered this evidence even in the course of pursuing other research \ntopics. </p>\n<p>Our analysis reveals that behind the rhetoric of rising test scores are a \ngrowing set of classroom practices in which test-prep activities are usurping a \nsubstantive curriculum. These practices are more widespread in those schools \nwhere administrator pay is tied to test scores and where test scores have been \nhistorically low. These are the schools that are typically attended by children \nwho are poor and African American or Latino, many non-English-language dominant. \nThese are the schools that have historically been under-resourced. In these \nschools, the pressure to raise test scores &quot;by any means necessary&quot; has \nfrequently meant that a regular education has been supplanted by activities \nwhose sole purpose is to raise test scores on this particular test.</p>\n<p>Because teachers’ and administrators’ job rewards under the TAAS system of \ntesting are aligned to children’s test scores, the TAAS system fosters an \nartificial curriculum. It is a curriculum aimed primarily at creating higher \ntest scores, not a curriculum that will educate these children for productive \nfutures. The testing system distances the content of curriculum from the \nknowledge base of teachers and from the cultures and intellectual capacities of \nthe children. It is creating an even wider gap between the curriculum offered to \nchildren in traditionally high-scoring schools (white, middle and upper-middle \nclass) and those in typically minority and typically poor schools.</p>\n<p>In this paper we present what we are seeing as the direct, negative \neducational consequences of this system of testing, and its harmful effects on \nthe quality of education available to disadvantaged Latino and African American \nchildren. Under the TAAS system of testing, curriculum, instruction, school \nresources, and children are all adversely affected:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity of curriculum. \n\n  <li>The TAAS system distorts educational expenditures, diverting scarce \n  instructional dollars away from such high quality curricular resources as \n  laboratory supplies and books toward test-prep materials and activities of \n  limited instructional value.</li></ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>TAAS provokes instruction that is aimed at the lowest level of skills and \n  information, and it crowds out other forms of learning, particularly for poor \n  and minority students. \n  <li>TAAS-based teaching and test-prep violates what is known about how \n  children learn. \n  <li>The TAAS is divorced from children’s experience and culture. \n  <li>The test is imposing exit measures that are particularly inappropriate for \n  LEP (Limited English-Proficient) students. \n  <li>TAAS is widening the gap between the education of children in Texas’ \n  poorest (historically low- performing) schools and that available to more \n  privileged children.</li></ul>\n<p>An analysis of the actual effects of the TAAS on children’s educational \nexperience is especially important given the publicity that has surrounded both \nthe TAAS scores and Texas children’s performance on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress (NAEP) exams. The latter exams present a mixed picture: \nthere are some gains in the early grades, but Texas NAEP gains in the early \ngrades do not seem to hold up in later grades. Also, the attention has been more \non the <i>rate</i> of improvement on NAEP rather than actual improvement. Highly \ntouted rates of improved scores (for example, that Texas was described as in the \ntop four &quot;most improved states&quot;) mask the fact that even after such &quot;gains,&quot; \nTexas students were still at or below average, registering lower than 21 of 40 \nparticipating states. Hence, neither the TAAS, nor attempts to interpret Texas’s \nNAEP rate gains as support for TAAS, represent the actual status of education \nfor youth in Texas.<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note2\"><sup>2</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"text2\"></a></p><b>\n<p>The Texas Accountability System and Minority Youth </p></b>\n<p>The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) system of testing and \ntest-driven curriculum was enacted by the Texas state legislature in the spring \nof 1990 (Texas Education Agency, 1998). It is the most recent in a series of \ncentralized, standardizing &quot;reforms&quot; in that state. It differs from earlier test \nsystems in being increasingly tied to teacher and principal job security and \npay. </p>\n<p>The policy rhetoric surrounding the TAAS goes like this: By measuring student \nperformance on a computer-scored standardized test, inferences can be drawn \nabout the quality of teacher and principal performance, as well as the aggregate \nquality of the school. School ratings, periodically published in full-page \nspreads in the state’s newspapers, now serve as barometers for the condition of \neducation in the state. </p>\n<p>Hence, important judgments about personnel and the quality of schooling now \nrevolve around a single indicator. There are clearly serious problems when any \nsingle indicator is used to assess the quality of so complex an enterprise as \neducating children. This is why the use of a single indicator to assess learning \nor to make decisions about tracking, promotion, and graduation violates the \nethics of the testing profession (Heubert &amp; Hauser, 1998).</p>\n<p>However, in this paper, our focus is not on the technical problems that are \ntypically raised for this and other tests (e.g., probable impacts of particular \nquestions, cut-off scores for passing, psychometric properties of the test, \netc.), all of which are quite real. Rather, we want to focus on another \nconsequence which is frequently overlooked: the direct, negative impact that \nthis accountability system is having on the education of this state’s most \neconomically disadvantaged, minority children. <i>What we are seeing is not the \n&quot;misuse&quot; of the TAAS testing system, but the playing out of its inherent logic \nat the expense of our poorest, minority children.</i></p>\n<p>These are the children who comprise the preponderance of minority youth in \nlarge urban school districts. For example, in the Houston Independent School \nDistrict (HISD), 52.5 percent and 34.1 percent of all students are Latino or \nAfrican American, respectively, while 10.6 percent are Anglo. Moreover, 73 \npercent of the total are on free or reduced lunch (HISD District and School \nProfiles, 1997-98).</p>\n<p>To fully assess the impact that this system of testing is having on the \neducation of minority youth, it is essential to understand how this system is \noperationalized in classrooms. One of the misleading features of this testing \nsystem is the notion that publishing scores disaggregated by the race and \nethnicity of the children alerts the public to inequities. In reality, these \nscores are misleading and diversionary: The scores loom so large that they \novershadow discussion of other, more telling indicators of quality of education, \namong these the degree of segregation, the level of poverty, or the number of \nstudents graduating, taking the SAT, and going to college. Furthermore, the \nscores mask the inequities produced when schools raise test scores at the \nexpense of substantive learning.</p>\n<p>Drawing on our collective and extensive research, throughout this paper we \nilluminate the ways that this testing system harms the educational quality and \neducational opportunity of minority and economically disadvantaged youth. Our \ncritique is organized around very specific and documented harmful effects of the \nTAAS system of testing on the quality of the curriculum, the quality of \ninstruction, and on resource allocation for the education of minority youth.<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note3\"><sup>3</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"text3\"> \nBecause of their dramatically increasing representation in our nation’s largest \nschool districts, a section below also addresses in some detail the even greater \ndamaging effects of the TAAS test for Limited English Proficient (LEP) youth in \nour schools.<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note4\"><sup>4</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n name=\"text4\"></a></a></p><b>\n<p>The Educational Impact of the TAAS</p><i>\n<p>In many urban schools, whose students are overwhelmingly poor and African \nAmerican and Latino, the TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity \nof <u>subjects being tested by TAAS</u>.</p></i></b>\n<p>The pressure to raise TAAS scores leads teachers to spend class time, often \nseveral hours each week, drilling students on practice exam materials. This TAAS \ndrill takes time from real teaching and learning: Much of the drill time is \nspent learning how to bubble-in answers, how to weed out obviously wrong \nanswers, and how to become accustomed to multiple-choice, computer-scored \nformats. In the name of &quot;alignment&quot; between course curricula and test, <i>TAAS \ndrills are becoming the curriculum in our poorest schools</i>.</p>\n<p>The pressure to raise TAAS scores leads teachers to substitute commercial \nTAAS-prep materials for the substance of the curriculum. Principals, deans of \ninstruction, and other building or central office administrators urge or even \nrequire teachers to set aside the course curriculum and to use the TAAS-prep \nmaterials in their place. </p>\n<p>Although TAAS is supplanting a more substantial curriculum throughout the \nstate, the problem emerges unevenly. It is more common in traditionally \nlow-performing schools, the schools attended by low-income and non-Anglo \nchildren. In contrast, middle-class children in white, middle class schools are \nreading literature, learning a variety of forms of writing, and studying \nmathematics aimed at problem-solving and conceptual understanding. In essence, \nthese children continue to receive an education appropriate for their age and \ngrade level, while poor and minority children are devoting class time to \npractice test materials whose purpose is to help children pass the TAAS. The \nTAAS system of testing thus widens the gap between the public education provided \nfor poor and minority children and that of children in traditionally \nhigher-scoring (that is, Anglo and wealthier) schools. </p>\n<p>Advocates of a state standardized system of testing frequently make the \nargument that &quot;before TAAS, minority children were receiving nothing. Now at \nleast, they are getting <i>something</i> (even if it is just exposure to the \nkinds of information that will be tested in the multiple-choice format).&quot;</p>\n<p>We have seen no studies that have documented this claim. But what we have \nseen is a reduction in content, even in those schools historically under-served \nand under-resourced, when the TAAS becomes the focus. An experienced Anglo \nEnglish teacher at Seguín High School (a pseudonym),<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note5\"><sup>5</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"text5\"> a \npredominantly Mexican HISD school, underscores this point. She commented that \nshe teaches &quot;less&quot; English each year.<a rel=\"nofollow\"\n target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note6\"><sup>6</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"text6\"></a></a></p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>Less as time goes on. Less as time goes on with the TAAS test thing. Because \nwe have to devote so much time to the specific functions of the TAAS test, it’s \nharder and harder [to teach English].</p></dir></dir>\n<p>Subjects tested by TAAS (reading, writing, and mathematics) are reduced, in \nthe test and in the test-prep materials, to isolated skills and fragments of \nfact. This artificial treatment of subjects into isolated components may enable \nchildren to recognize those components on a multiple-choice test. However, this \ntreatment does not necessarily enable children to use these components in other \ncontexts. For example, high school teachers report that although practice tests \nand classroom drills have raised the pass rate for the reading section of the \nTAAS at their school, many of their students are unable to use those same skills \nfor actual reading. These students are passing the TAAS reading by being able to \nselect among answers given. But they are not able to read assignments, to make \nmeaning of literature, to complete reading assignments outside of class, nor to \nconnect reading assignments to other parts of the course such as discussion and \nwriting.</p>\n<p>Middle school teachers report that the TAAS emphasis on reading short \npassages, then selecting among answers given to questions based on those short \npassages, has made it very difficult for students to read a sustained reading \nassignment. After several years in classes where the &quot;reading&quot; assignments were \nincreasingly TAAS practice materials, middle school teachers in more than one \ndistrict have reported that children were unable to read a novel even two years \nbelow grade level.</p>\n<p>In writing, students are increasingly being asked to write repetitively in \nonly the format of that year’s TAAS writing objective. One African American \nparent, whose first son received an excellent fourth grade education in a Texas \nelementary school a few years ago, reported that when her second son entered \nfourth grade at the school in the fall of 1998, the entire fourth-grade \ncurriculum had disappeared. The teachers, facilities, and principal were all the \nsame, but the fourth grade curriculum had essentially been replaced by daily \nwriting of &quot;the persuasive essay,&quot; according to the strict TAAS format for that \nessay.</p>\n<p>The approved format for the TAAS essay, for all children in the state, is the \n&quot;five paragraph essay.&quot; Within this essay format, long discredited by teachers \nof writing, each of five paragraphs contains exactly five sentences. Each \nparagraph begins with a &quot;topic sentence,&quot; followed by three &quot;supporting \nsentences,&quot; and a &quot;concluding sentence,&quot; which essentially recaps the topic \nsentence. Paragraph one serves the essay in the same way the topic sentence \nserves each paragraph; the concluding paragraph essentially plays the role in \nthe essay that each concluding sentence plays in its own paragraph. </p>\n<p>Teachers of writing who work with their students on developing ideas, on \nfinding their voice as writers, and on organizing papers in ways appropriate to \nboth the ideas and the paper’s intended audience find themselves in conflict \nwith this prescriptive format. The format subordinates ideas to form, sets a \nsingle form out as &quot;the essay,&quot; and produces, predictably, rote writing. Writing \nas it relates to thinking, to language development and fluency, to understanding \none’s audience, to enriching one’s vocabulary, to developing ideas, has been \nreplaced by TAAS writing to this format. &quot;Writing&quot; as TAAS prep no longer bears \nany resemblance to what research shows to be a developmental activity in \nchildren’s language competency.</p>\n<p>However, the essay is easily scorable in the testing of large populations \nbecause what counts is the strict format rather than the development of ideas. \nMany teachers describe having to teach this format in terms of its intended \naudience, &quot;Just think of yourself as writing for someone sitting in a cubicle in \na bureaucracy, counting sentences and indentations.&quot; Others report teaching \ntheir students that there is &quot;TAAS writing&quot; and &quot;real writing.&quot; Still others say \nthat in their school teachers are required to have students do only TAAS \nwriting, the five-paragraph essay, weekly or even daily until after the TAAS \ntest (in other words, until late spring). </p>\n<p>Students also complain about the persuasive essay. For example, an \nintellectually gifted, Mexican American senior male assigned to (i.e., \nmisplaced) in Seguín High School’s &quot;regular&quot; track, feels that the school’s \npriorities are misguided. In his view, the school should be preparing students \nfor the SAT. On the subject of many of his peers’ academic limitations, he \nprovided the following commentary:</p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>I’ve realized that the kids have good arguments here, but they have \nabsolutely no argument skills. They probably have persuasive skills for the \nTAAS. Argument skills, none. The only argument they have is probably to curse. \nSay the F-word and that’s it.</p></dir></dir>\n<p>Reflecting on a conversation he had on the subject of the college application \nprocess with his friends, he further places the onus of students’ limitations on \nthe school itself:</p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>They [friends] were telling me that they are kind of fed up with that [the \npersuasive essay], because here are kids that are filling out scholarship \napplications and essays. They are writing essays, and they don’t know how to \nwrite anything else but a persuasive essay for the TAAS. They prepare us for the \nTAAS, and we are not just test takers. I try to explain to people that we are \nnot just persons who need to develop critical thinking skills on how to choose \nbetween five things. How to choose the correct answer out of five. That’s \nnothing!</p></dir></dir>\n<p>The required &quot;TAAS objectives&quot; or &quot;TAAS prompts&quot; which are to be drilled each \nday are often presented to teachers as five- to ten-minute exercises. However, \nteachers report that drilling to these prompts, often required by the \nadministration if their children are poor and minority (with a history of low \nscores), frequently usurps so much of the class period that little time is left \nfor teaching and learning.</p>\n<p>It is a myth that TAAS sets the minimum standards and that teachers are \nencouraged to go beyond that. In many schools, it is the best-prepared teachers \nwith the richest curriculum who are required to scale back in order to teach to \nthe sequence and format of the TAAS.<font face=\"Times,Times New Roman\"\n color=\"#ff0000\"> </font><font face=\"Times,Times New Roman\">In low-performing \nschools, even the most knowledgeable teachers are asked to set aside their \nlesson plans and materials to teach to the TAAS.</font></p>\n<p>Whether children were being taught &quot;nothing&quot; before or whether they were \nbeing given a meaningful curriculum, the pressure to raise TAAS scores shows no \nevidence of opening children’s access to great literature, to conceptual \nunderstanding in mathematics, to fluency in writing, or to other learning \nexperiences that seriously address previous inadequacies in their education. Nor \ndoes TAAS seem likely to do so. Under the current accountability system based on \nthis test, financial rewards go to those schools whose scores go up, not \nnecessarily to those in need of serious upgrading of staff and materials. In \naddition, the statewide system of testing has not been accompanied by a parallel \ninvestment that could reduce inadequacies and inequities in low-performing \nschools. The result is that many very real problems persist, problems which are \nnot addressed by more, and more centralized, measurement and testing, or \nproblems which testing may exacerbate by its focus on a narrow set of measures \nrather than a comprehensive look at children’s learning.</p><b><i>\n<p>The TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity of course content \nin <u>subjects not tested by TAAS,</u> because teachers are encouraged or \nrequired to substitute TAAS test preparation activities for the curriculum in \nthose subjects.</p></i></b>\n<p>The study of science, social studies, art, and other subjects that are not \nexamined by the TAAS are all undermined by the TAAS system. For example, many \nscience teachers in schools with poor and minority children are required by \ntheir principals to suspend the teaching of science for weeks, and in some cases \nfor months, in order to devote science class time to drill and practice on the \nmath sections of the TAAS. The first loss, of course, is the chance to learn \nscience. The second is the chance to learn to become highly knowledgeable in \nmathematics. Many science teachers have little background in mathematics; the \n&quot;mathematics&quot; they are doing is drill and practice with commercial TAAS-prep \nmaterials. </p>\n<p>The direct loss of both science and mathematics learning is clear. Less \nobvious, but equally important, is the way this TAAS practice widens the gap in \nscience learning between children in middle class, higher performing schools, \nwho continue to study science, and poor and minority children, whose science \nclasses are more frequently sacrificed for TAAS prep.</p>\n<p>Social studies is another core subject that is frequently suspended or \ninterrupted for TAAS preparation. For instance, all history and social studies \nteachers in one Latino high school were told several months in advance of the \nTAAS to spend twenty minutes a day preparing students for the TAAS. According to \none of these teachers: </p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>Twenty minutes is just too much. By the time we get to teaching our history \nlesson, most of the time is gone. And then it’s hard to re-capture the rhythm of \nthe previous day’s lesson, which was also interrupted by the \nTAAS.</p></dir></dir>\n<p>The content of elective subjects is also often set aside to make time for \nTAAS prep. Art teachers report that they are required to drill on the grammar \nsections of TAAS. An ROTC instructor was assigning the five-paragraph essay each \nweek, not to link writing to ROTC but to add another drill to the regimen, this \ntime in a rote essay.</p><b><i>\n<p>The TAAS system distorts educational expenditures, diverting scarce \ninstructional dollars away from such high quality curricular resources as \nlaboratory supplies and books toward test-prep materials and activities of \nlimited instructional value beyond the test. </p></i></b>\n<p>Under TAAS, there is a widespread press to spend instructional dollars on \ntest-prep materials and activities. These include expenditures on expensive \nmaterials for &quot;alignment&quot; and &quot;accountability&quot; systems and consultants. It also \nincludes diverting dollars from Texas’ classrooms to out-of-state vendors of \ntests, test-prep materials, consultants and related materials. </p>\n<p>The press to spend instructional dollars for test prep is felt most \nespecially in schools with large populations of poor and minority children, \nwhich have been historically underfunded. In these schools, scarce instructional \ndollars are being diverted into materials and activities whose only value is to \nincrease TAAS scores, not to produce educated children well prepared for college \nor future work. For example, to the extent such schools had fewer sets of \nclassroom novels and other reading materials before, the pressure of the TAAS \ntest does not lead to such purchases. Rather, it tends to lead to the purchase \nof costly, commercial test-prep materials. These provide practice in answering \nmultiple choice, recall questions pertaining to brief passages that are written \nexplicitly for test-prep purposes. </p><b><i></i></b>\n<p>This diversion of dollars further widens the gap between the quality of \neducation offered to poor and minority children and that provided to wealthier \nchildren. Middle class and wealthy districts either do not spend money on these \nTAAS-related systems or they have the capacity to make up the difference in \nlocal funding for schools; either way, wealthier districts continue spending \nmoney on high quality instructional materials, which advance their children’s \neducation and place them in the national mainstream of what is considered to be \na quality education.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, expenditures for management and &quot;alignment&quot; systems are \ndisplacing instructional expenditures, and expenditures for management \nconferences and consulting around increasing compliance with TAAS are displacing \nprograms of teacher learning and professional pedagogical development. As the \nstate curriculum becomes increasingly test-driven, it becomes difficult to \ndisaggregate test-prep from &quot;curricular&quot; expenditures. Administrators argue that \nmaterials aimed at boosting test scores are in fact instructional expenses. </p>\n<p>Parents and taxpayers, however, are often surprised to learn that what may \nappear to be curricular and instructional, in budgets and expenditure lines, do \nnot resemble instructional materials in the tradition sense. Software, for \nexample, can be a means of providing students with up-to-date scientific or \nhistorical information, with activities for manipulating geometric figures or \nfor learning to conduct information searches. However, in schools dominated by \nTAAS, software often focuses on test-prep drills, little different from \ndrill-and-practice worksheets. &quot;Reading&quot; may make the lay person think of books, \nmagazines, anthologies of literature, but in TAAS controlled schools, it may \ntake the form of purchased practice tests of short reading passages. </p>\n<p>The justification for these materials is often that they give students \npractice with the &quot;basics,&quot; which they must master before &quot;going on.&quot; However, \namong the schools we have visited, those where even low-achieving students are \ntaught the subjects tend to have students who both learn more and score higher \non TAAS than those schools where TAAS-prep has displaced the curriculum.</p>\n<p>In districts where schools’ TAAS scores are tied to incentive pay for \nteachers or principals, and where TAAS-based performance contracts have replaced \ntenure, there is an even greater tendency for school personnel to shift dollars \naway from instruction and into the expensive TAAS-prep and &quot;alignment&quot; materials \nand consultants. Again, frequently these incentives are applied in schools or \ndistricts whose populations are poor or minority or both. And, again, because \nsuch consultants and materials are narrowly focused on boosting test scores, \nthey are unlikely to enhance children’s capacity for thinking and learning in \nthe many realms beyond the TAAS test.</p>\n<p>The inversion of incentives needs to be systematically examined. If only \nthose schools whose scores increase receive additional funding (a form of merit \nreward), then the incentive to focus only on TAAS will increase (to the \ndetriment of more substantial learning). Likewise, if the neediest schools, \nwhich are least likely to have adequate resources, are trapped in that need \n<i>until</i> they can raise scores, they will see no compensating investments to \nbring their students opportunities to learn in line with more privileged \nschools. There is no plan to make a massive investment in the neediest schools. \nIn fact, much of the public rhetoric is that &quot;low performing schools&quot; do not \ndeserve additional public investment. It is as if their poverty is tied in some \nPuritanical sense to lack of virtue, with low scores as their Scarlet Letter of \nguilt.</p><b><i>\n<p>The TAAS system of testing emphasizes the lowest level of information and \nskills, crowds out other forms of learning, and disengages students in many \nurban schools, particularly those whose children are poor and \nnon-Anglo.</p></i></b>\n<p>Teachers report that the pressure to drill for TAAS has caused them to omit \nor severely decrease other forms of learning because of the lack of time or \nbecause their principals are urging them to devote time only to those activities \nwhich will be measured by the TAAS. Library research, independent projects, \nscience experiments, oral histories, long-term writing assignments, writing \nassignments different from those being tested in a particular year, longer-term \nreading assignments that include related writing and speaking activities – all \nare being reduced, even though they are highly motivating for children. Such \ninstructional activities, which engage children in higher-order problem solving \nand thinking, are deleted in those schools (poor, minority) where TAAS scores \nhave been low.</p>\n<p>The rigor of the academic learning is also sacrificed by courses like &quot;TAAS \nMath&quot; and &quot;TAAS English,&quot; which certain students are required to take to enable \nthem to pass the exit exam. The curriculum in these classes is predictably \nfragmented and incoherent, because teachers teach abstracted pieces of the \ncurriculum in order to cover the various segments of the exam. Referred to as \n&quot;local credit,&quot; such courses do not count toward the 24 credits that are \nrequired for high school graduation. Since they are not &quot;real&quot; math and English \ncourses, they are not taken very seriously by the students. </p>\n<p>Placement in these courses also undermines learning due to wasteful and \nbureaucratic scheduling issues. If a student is enrolled in a fall TAAS course \nand takes and passes the exam in October, he or she will have to wait out the \nrest of the semester in that &quot;non-course&quot; until it is over. An administrator \nfrom one of the larger, well-integrated HISD schools where such courses are \noffered told us that students start skipping class after they pass the TAAS test \n&quot;since the course doesn’t count toward high school credit anyway.&quot; According to \nthis individual, TAAS courses are also wasteful if the students fail the fall \nexam, because they have to sign up a second time in another such course. This \nexpands to a whole year the time that students are not in the regular \ncurriculum. In addition to the TAAS courses, students must of course meet the \nnormal math and English requirements for graduation. Additional requirements \ntend to also translate either into summer school attendance or graduating off \nschedule, if at all.</p>\n<p>While Anglo and middle class children in this same HISD school overwhelmingly \npass the TAAS test within the context of the normal curriculum, an entire \nsegment of the school’s population is being subjected to months, if not years, \nof TAAS prep. By treating these students as if they are unteachable, the system \nitself engenders a cumulative deficit in students’ knowledge, encouraging their \nresistance not to education, but to schooling (Valenzuela, 1999). Since the \ncontent of schooling is already deemed by many regular track (non-honors or \ncollege-bound) youth to be boring, unrewarding, and irrelevant to their lives, \nwe are seeing the TAAS system of testing promote an even greater sense of \nalienation.</p>\n<p>Preliminary research is showing that those schools that score higher on TAAS \n(usually wealthier, with fewer minority children) rarely teach directly to the \nTAAS. They teach children; they teach science, math, social studies, literature, \nwriting, the arts. They teach the subjects. A tortured logic governs the highly \nprescriptive administration of the TAAS in predominantly minority schools: If \nthe scores increase, it is because the school taught more to the test; however, \nif the scores decrease, the school needs to teach more to the test.</p>\n<p>Yet, teaching to the test and thereby improving scores does not indicate \nincreased learning or improved capacities for complex problem solving. For \nexample, one largely Hispanic, traditionally low-performing high school with \nvirtually no library, a severe shortage of textbooks, and little laboratory \nequipment for its students, spent $20,000 (almost its entire instructional \nbudget) for a set of commercial test-prep materials. Even the school’s best \nteachers were required to set aside their high-quality lessons and replace them \nwith the test-prep materials. Scores on some sections of the TAAS did go up, but \nteachers report that students’ actual capacity to read, to handle high school \nlevel assignments, to engage in serious thought and be able to follow through on \nwork actually declined.</p>\n<p>This school, touted in the newspapers for increasing the TAAS passing rate on \nreading, is now searching for a way to counter what is seen by the faculty as a \nserious deficiency in the students’ ability to read. It is clear that higher \nscores do not mean that children are learning to a higher level. Such scores may \nmean that nothing is being taught except TAAS-prep.</p><b><i>\n<p>The TAAS system of testing goes against what is known in research on \nchildren’s learning.</p></i></b>\n<p>Research on children’s learning shows that learning is not linear, that it \nmust build on what children already know and understand, that it must engage \nchildren’s active thinking, and that it must engage many senses (Gardner, 1991; \nOhanian, 1999; Sacks, 1999). In striking contrast, the TAAS reinforces one \nparticular mode of learning. This cognitive impact of the test has not been \nseriously investigated. Classroom observations and teacher reports, however, \nraise critical questions about the sort of learning that is reinforced, those \nwhich are subordinated to TAAS formats, and those which are increasingly \nstructured out of test-dominated classrooms.</p>\n<p>The TAAS mode of learning is to &quot;master&quot; brief, discreet, randomly selected \npieces of information. The reading comprehension and grammatical sections of the \nwriting TAAS, for example, cover isolated skills through very brief written \npassages. These written passages are not intended to build a cumulative \nknowledge base; they are not meant to connect with children’s understanding. The \nisolated skills are presented in fragments, carefully sequenced to match the \nfragmented and isolated skills in the Texas curriculum frameworks. Learning \nfragments of fact and skill out of context is known to be counterproductive to \nunderstanding and to building cumulative skills which can be applied in an \nunfamiliar setting or to unfamiliar information in the future.</p>\n<p>Two features of the TAAS and TAAS-prep materials are especially damaging to \nlearning. The first is that under the TAAS system, students are to choose among \npossible answers that are given to them; they rarely have to think on their own, \npuzzle out a problem, come up with a possible answer, or articulate an idea. \nThis engenders passivity and a dependent learning style that fails to develop \nmany essential cognitive skills. The second is that TAAS presents the child with \nchoices, of which all but one are incorrect. To the extent that children, \nespecially in poor and minority schools, are taught a curriculum and test drills \nthat are in the TAAS format, they are spending three-quarters of their learning \ntime considering erroneous, &quot;wrong&quot; material. It is doubtful that there is any \nrespectable learning theory that advocates children’s continual exposure to \nincorrect material. </p>\n<p>Again, the TAAS system places most at risk the children in schools that \nheavily emphasize raising TAAS scores (usually poor and minority). These \nchildren not only fail to learn the same rich, complex material that children in \nmiddle class schools learn, but they are simultaneously required to devote hours \nand hours each week to a de facto worthless curriculum. By keeping children \nfocused on these drills and these disembodied facts, the TAAS system of testing \nis denying them access to forms of knowledge and ways of knowing that can lead \nthem beyond this minimal level, into higher forms of learning. That is why one \nteacher said that yes, under TAAS, certain students in her school who previously \nwere not being taught much math (these were bilingual students, recently \nimmigrated), are &quot;getting more math now that we are testing everyone.&quot; But she \ncautioned, &quot;but of course, it’s not real math – it’s not what you would want for \n<i>your</i> children. It’s just TAAS Math.&quot; The opportunity costs of spending \nweeks, months and even years on test drills which narrow learning modes and \nclose off complex thought may be one of the costliest effects of the TAAS system \nof testing. It is a cost being borne by the least-well served children in our \nschools.</p><b><i>\n<p>The generic curriculum inherent in the TAAS system of testing is divorced \nfrom children’s experiences, language and cultures</p></i></b>.\n<p>The TAAS system of testing is not respectful of, nor does it build on, \nchildren’s personal experiences, the cultures of their families, nor the \nvariations in learning style and interests that span any classroom. \n(&quot;Subtractive schooling&quot; [Valenzuela, 1997, 1998, 1999] is a term that captures \nthis problematic, ubiquitous feature of public schooling for U.S. minorities.) \nThis use of a generic curriculum is frequently further aggravated by culturally \nand socially distant teachers who teach the exam through traditional, \nteacher-centered, lecture formats.</p>\n<p>Important lessons about culture can be learned from the experiences of one \nLatina teacher, Ms. Moreno (a pseudonym), who teaches in one of the larger, \nvirtually all-Mexican high schools. Through a rather energetic and lively style \nof teaching that includes &quot;TAAS Pep Rallies&quot; for her students, a majority of \nstudents in her classes every semester are able to pass the test.</p>\n<p>When asked why they were able to learn from Ms. Moreno, students often \nreferred to her use of &quot;cariño&quot; (or &quot;affection&quot;) in the classroom. They also \nsaid that she taught &quot;the Mexican way,&quot; meaning that she used a lot of Spanish \nin the classroom and welcomed a high degree of interaction. An excerpt from an \nLEP student’s written commentary about her heroic teacher appears below (in her \nexact words):</p>\n<p></p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>One of the heroes I know is Ms. ____, she is a person that cares about \npeople. I have her TAAS class and she is teachers in a way that everybody can \nunderstand her because, she talks in Spanish, and English. I think she is a \nstrong person. Because she spent many hours teaching her students in the \nmornings and afternoons, she is always telling us that we can come to her room \nduring our lunch period that she is going to be ready to teaches us. I come \nduring my lunch period and she teaches me every problem I don’t understand, and \nI feel very comfortable with her because she treats us like friends not like a \nstudent. (Written assignment for an English class by a senior female student at \nSeguín dated September 14, 1994)</p></dir></dir>\n<p>Ms. Moreno was so committed to helping students pass the test that she, of \nher own accord and without additional pay, held classes five days a week at \nseven o’clock in the morning, to help students pass the TAAS. As one can see \nfrom her student’s letter, her lunch hours were also dedicated to helping \nchildren. Through her commitment, cultural sensitivity, and her Mexican brand of \ncaring, she was able to help more children pass the test as a single individual \nthan most of her colleagues combined. She embodies the ethos that \nLadson-Billings (1994) identifies as central to culturally relevant pedagogy for \nAfrican American youth. Motivated by a sense of shared fate and shared cultural \nassumptions, effective teachers of African American children see their role as \none of &quot;giving back to the community.&quot; Ms. Moreno was no different and just as \neffective.</p>\n<p>Ms. Moreno attributed her success—and in contrast, the majority of her \ncolleagues’ lack of success—to the following: test anxiety and teachers’ \ninability to teach to &quot;this population.&quot; To prepare her students, she used \ntypical English as a Second Language (ESL) methodologies, even if her students \nwere not in the ESL program (i.e., were Mexican American). She lamented her \ncolleagues’ penchant for teaching TAAS Math through standard, teacher-centered \nlecture formats. She viewed manipulatives as particularly essential, because \nthey help students visualize relationships and therefore make sense of, and \nretain, information. While she was a firm believer that multi-sensory approaches \nwork best for underprivileged youth, Ms. Moreno’s capacity to help her students \nrise to her expectations were also clearly mediated by culturally-relevant \npedagogy.</p>\n<p>The research literature is clear that the learning of abstractions which have \nlittle connection to children’s lives and cultures, or which present a \nmonocultural, technical view of knowledge, yield little in long-term learning \n(e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1994; Valenzuela, 1999). It is unfortunate and of great \nconsequence that problems of abstractions and technical, fragmented sorts of \nfacts and formulas associated with the TAAS combine with an historic inability \nof non-minority, middle-class teachers to promote widespread academic success \nwith minority, low-income youth in segregated settings (DeVillar et al., 1994). \nThis Latina teacher’s example strongly suggests how real academic achievement \namong underprivileged youth can be enormously improved through cultural \nawareness, sensitivity, and a commitment to social justice that no commercial \ntest-prep materials can possibly package. Attracting and supporting those \nteachers who are knowledgeable about their subjects, about children’s learning, \nand also about children’s cultures is a national need. It is one that will be \ndifficult to fill when teachers are asked to bracket off their concern for \nchildren’s whole development in order to process them through testing systems \nwhich undermine, rather than foster, these relationships.</p><b><i>\n<p>The TAAS exit test is particularly inappropriate for Limited English \nProficient (LEP) students.</p></i></b>\n<p>The TAAS system of testing has many negative effects on teaching, learning, \nand curriculum across the state. And, as we have discussed, many of the most \nharmful effects fall on those students whose education has been historically \nunder-resourced and whose academic opportunities have, by race and economic \ncircumstance, been severely limited.</p>\n<p>Even given these general patterns, there is the need to focus more closely on \nthe most rapidly growing student population in Texas: the children who, with \ntheir families, are recent immigrants. English is not the language of their \nfamily. </p>\n<p>Harris County, Texas helps to put this issue into perspective. The county has \naround 3,000,000 people. The latest census data show that there are 875,000 \nLatinos in the county. While many of these are descendants of original Mexican \nfamilies in this region, and others are second- or third- (or more) generation \ncitizens, many others are recent arrivals. The schools call them &quot;immediate \nimmigrants&quot; -- children who have arrived within the past three months. Several \nsuburban counties in Texas show an increase of more than 80% in their Hispanic \npopulations within the past five years.</p>\n<p>The presence of these children, and their need for a quality education, is no \nlonger an issue at the margins – either in Texas or in many other states. How \nthey are taught, how they learn, how their educational progress is evaluated are \nof central importance to these children, to their families, and to their \ncommunities. The failure of the TAAS system of testing to encompass a model of \neducation which is appropriate to these children is telling not just because of \nproblems the testing system is generating for these children. It is also \nimportant because it brings to light the ways the test, and the testing system, \nslight the relationship between children’s learning and who they are.</p>\n<p>The TAAS exit test results in a gap in student achievement that may be \ndirectly attributed to the test and not to these students’ abilities. As \nnewcomers at the high school level, non-fluent speakers of English are typically \nplaced in the English as a Second Language (ESL) curriculum (or &quot;the ESL \nghetto,&quot; as one scholar refers to it [Valdés, 1998]; Valenzuela [1999] refers to \nthis placement practice in her own work as &quot;cultural tracking&quot;). In the ESL \ntrack, students spend much of their day in courses that focus on English \nvocabulary and English reading without regard to their prior academic training. \nTheir remaining subject matter courses are characteristically remedial and \nrarely, if ever, honors or college-bound. Rather than inferring that the \nimmigrants’ much needed – though often deficient – school administered language \nsupport systems should be removed, it is necessary to focus attention on several \nkey consequences of &quot;cultural tracking.&quot; These relate directly to LEP students’ \ntest performance. </p>\n<p>If lucky, LEP students are placed in ESL subject matter courses like \n&quot;ESL-Math&quot; and &quot;ESL-Biology,&quot; which approximate courses offered in the regular, \nmainstream, English-only track. Teachers offering these courses tend to be \nsensitive to issues that face language learners, particularly the sheer amount \nof time – between 5 and 7 years -- that it takes a young adult to gain native \nfluency in a second language. Consequently, teachers offer these subject matter \ncourses to keep students from falling behind academically while they learn \nEnglish. As one Seguín ESL teacher phrased it, &quot;It’s unfair to put their \nacademics on hold while they (students) take time out to learn the language.&quot; \nAnother motivation for teaching these courses is the ESL teachers’ recognition \nof ample academic talent among their immigrant population. These teachers seek \nto capitalize on and nurture immigrant students’ talents in and through ESL \nsubject matter courses.</p>\n<p>Theory would predict the prevalence of academic talent among many ESL youth, \nespecially those schooled in their own country for many years prior to entering \nU.S. schools (Cummins, 1984; Skutnabb-Kangas &amp; Cummins, 1988). That is, the \nmore a student is schooled in one’s first language, the greater their conceptual \ngrasp of academic subject matter (e.g., punctuation, how to summarize, arrive at \nconclusions, write papers, etc.). The greater their grasp of academic subject \nmatter, the easier it is to transfer this knowledge to the second language.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the more common situation in high schools -- even those \nthroughout the Southwestern United States -- is a scarcity of ESL subject matter \ncourses either because of a lack resources to offer such courses or because of \nphilosophical opposition or both (Olsen, 1997; Valdés, 1998). This results in \nESL-remedial course placements, which in turn stall students’ learning of the \nmainstream curriculum. This process masks how the intellectual abilities and \npotential of so many talented immigrant students get compromised.</p>\n<p>To appreciate and understand the magnitude of this waste in talent, one has \nto consider the characteristics of the immigrant population. Research shows that \nMexican immigrants are a select group with average education levels that are \nhigher than the national average for Mexico. They are risk-takers able to delay \ngratification by accumulating capital to effectuate their passage across the \nborder (for reviews, see Buriel, 1987, 1994). Studies, including Valenzuela’s \n(1999), further show immigrants and their children possess a progressive \norientation toward schools and U.S. society, generally. Moreover, since only 15 \npercent of the middle-school-aged population attend secondary school in Mexico, \nto come across a critical mass of such students at the high school level is to \nencounter a truly &quot;elite&quot; crowd that their ESL and Spanish language teachers \nreadily recognize.</p>\n<p>What must also be considered is that Mexico has a challenging national \ncurriculum which is publicly subsidized and thus accessible to most through the \nsixth year. By the fourth grade, students know the anatomy of the human body. By \nthe sixth grade, students take the equivalent of ninth-grade level geometry in \nthe U.S.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most school personnel are not sensitive to these kinds of \npossibilities—either because they cannot read a transcript from Mexico or \nbecause they simply assume that a good education is not possible there. As a \nresult, youth get systematically channeled into the &quot;ESL ghetto.&quot; Even in \ninstances when they are allowed to enjoy subject matter courses, immigrant youth \nare systematically denied the opportunity to achieve at an advanced academic \nlevel since none of these courses are offered at an honors’ level. This \nstructure helped Valenzuela to understand immigrant youth who said in interviews \nthat they used to know math, or who further reported that they used to be \nsmarter. In a word, many were &quot;de-skilled&quot; as a result of having been schooled \nin the U.S.<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note7\"><sup>7</sup></a><a rel=\"nofollow\"\n name=\"text7\"></a></p>\n<p>Even if one considers that some amount of de-skilling is occurring, the \nquantitative part of the Seguín High School study arrived at three significant \nand interrelated findings. First, within the regular, non-honors, track, \nimmigrant youth outperform their U.S.-born counterparts. In multivariate \nanalysis, these differences were consistently statistically significant, \nsuggesting that immigrant youth have an edge, academically speaking. A second \nfinding from survey data corroborated the ethnographic evidence that immigrant \nyouth experience school significantly more positively than their U.S.-born \npeers. That is, they see teachers as more caring and accessible than their \nU.S.-born counterparts, and they rate the school climate in more positive terms \nas well. They are also much less likely to evade school rules and policies. \nThese students’ attitudes contrast markedly with that of their second- and \nthird-generation counterparts whose responses in turn are not significantly \ndifferent from one another. Particularly striking is how generational status—and \nnot gender or curriculum track placement—influences orientations toward \nschooling. These findings concur with research from numerous other large- and \nsmall-scale studies (e.g., Matute-Bianchi, 1991; Kao and Tienda, 1995). Third, \nthe level of schooling youth attain in Mexico or Latin America and students’ \ngrades are significantly correlated. That is, for each year of schooling \nattained in Mexico or Latin America, achievement goes up, even after controlling \nfor the quality of education they received (based on a subjective measure of \nschool quality).</p>\n<p>These three pieces of evidence together suggest that immigrant youth should \nbe passing the TAAS test. Since their chances of passing the TAAS test are lower \nthan their English-dominant counterparts, it is logical to assume that their \npoor passing rates on the TAAS test suggest more their difficulties with the \nEnglish language nature of the test, than their potential to achieve \nacademically at a high level. Their teachers frequently refer to this barrier as \na chief explanation. In short, children of limited English proficiency are \nespecially handicapped in their ability to exhibit their knowledge by the TAAS \nexit test.</p><b>\n<p>In conclusion, the TAAS is a ticket to nowhere</p></b>. It is harmful to \ninstruction by its rigid format, its artificial treatment of subject matter, its \nembodiment of discredited learning theories, its ignoring of children’s cultures \nand languages, and its emphasis on the accounting of prescribed learning. The \ntest itself, and the system of testing and test preparation, have in poor and \nminority schools come to usurp instructional resources and supplant the \nopportunity for high quality, meaningful learning. \n<p>This system of testing is therefore not the benign &quot;reform&quot; its political \nadvocates claim. Nor is it the remedy for a malfunctioning bureaucratic system \nthat is merely in need of stricter internal management and accountability. The \nTAAS system of testing exerts a direct, negative impact on the curriculum, \ncreating new problems outlined herein and exacerbating old ones related to \nhistoric inequities between rich/majority and poor/minority children. In \naddition, it masks the real problems of inequity that underlie the failure to \nadequately educate children. By shifting funds, public attention, and scarce \norganizational and budgetary resources away from schools and into the coffers of \nthe testing industry vendors, the futures of poor and minority children and the \nschools they attend are being compromised.</p>\n<p>For the children, successful performance on the TAAS in no way ensures either \na quality education or a promising future. An education aimed at TAAS scores \ndoes unequivocally reduce children’s chances for a real education. The pressure \nto raise scores is greatest in our poorest, historically least-well-funded \nschools. To raise scores in those schools -- absent a major investment in \nteacher knowledge, school facilities, and instructional materials -- educators \nare diverting time, energy and dollars away from the kind of instruction \navailable in middle class schools and into materials whose only purpose is to \nraise TAAS scores.</p>\n<p>We conclude with an episode from Seguín High School that poignantly captures \nthe human side of this misdirected and injurious policy:</p>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<p>I attended Seguín’s high school’s graduation ceremony. In the middle of the \nceremony after the class song was played, about eight students stood up to chant \nthe words scrawled on a large banner they held in their hands: &quot;14 YEARS OF \nSCHOOL. MADE IT THIS FAR. WHY CAN’T WE WALK?&quot; After the students chanted these \nphrases several times, three cops and six ushers approached the crowd to take \naway their banners. The audience booed the cops, including all or most of the \ngraduates sitting in their seats. The hundreds of boos, which included parents’, \nbrought the ceremony to a halt. Some students were escorted out of the audience \nby the police while others left on their own. I could clearly see how this \nstate-level policy of linking the TAAS test to high school graduation was sensed \nby everyone as unjust. It was only too fitting to see how this policy was \n&quot;policed&quot; in a final show of force to the would-be high school grads. \n(Valenzuela’s June 5, 1996 field notes)</p></dir></dir>\n<p>Rather than youth failing schools, schools are failing our minority youth \nthrough the TAAS system of testing. In short, we fail to see how the state’s \ninterest is served by a policy that simultaneously diminishes young people’s \naccess to a substantive education and closes off their opportunity for a high \nschool graduation, especially when this route represents their best hope for a \nsocially productive life.</p>\n<p>There is a critical need for additional independent research that examines \nthe effects of the TAAS system of testing on the curriculum in various school \nsubjects, on children’s capacities to learn and their sense of themselves as \nlearners, on teachers’ work, and on teacher exit (especially highly educated, \nhighly qualified, and effective teachers) from public schools where TAAS is \naligned with administrative bonuses and &quot;performance contracts.&quot; Virtually none \nof the effects on teaching, curriculum, and children which we summarize here are \ncaptured by analyses and re-analyses of individual or aggregate test score data. \n</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a need for studies that do not rely merely on \nofficially reported data on test scores and on tested students. There has been \nmuch analysis of the test score numbers, including analyses disaggregated by \nrace. However, such studies have primarily relied on numbers provided by the \nstate education agency and/or school districts. Furthermore, such studies are \noften carried out primarily by analysts employed by, or on contract to, the \nstate or employed by organizations with continuing state contracts for such \nstudies or for &quot;TAAS implementation,&quot; TAAS consulting, or \n&quot;teacher/administrative training&quot; based on TAAS. </p>\n<p>There is also a need for public discourse surrounding the many ways to assess \nchildren’s learning and evaluate their academic progress. &quot;Alternative \nassessments&quot; in most subject areas are not &quot;alternative&quot; except in the policy \ncontext. Through such professional organizations as the National Council of \nTeacher of English, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the \nNational Writing Project (and many regional writing projects), the Coalition of \nEssential Schools, and others there is a broad and deep expertise on ways of \nunderstanding how and whether children are learning. Authentic means of \ndocumenting children’s learning do not derive from management systems, nor are \nthey intended to be tools of management. They are &quot;authentic&quot; to the extent that \nthey are premised on a rich and complex view of curriculum subjects, on \nchildren’s intellectual engagement with learning, and on an understanding of \nlearning as developmental. They are &quot;authentic&quot; if they are able to encompass \nthe relational part of teaching and learning. Ideally they can encompass \nlearning that honors the imagination and the open-ended possibilities that \nsubstantive learning supports. </p>\n<p>Authentic forms of assessment are ways of sharing information among children, \ntheir teachers, and their parents. They should be means by which adults can \nlearn more about how to effectively teach not in a generic sense, but how to \nbetter teach &quot;this child, these children.&quot; </p>\n<p>There is at present an enormous gap in vocabulary and in ideology between \nthose who teach and those who set policy. This gap must be addressed if the \nsystem is ever to be corrected; that is, if what is known about teaching and \nlearning are ever going to shape large educational systems rather than be \ncompromised by them. Ways of governing and managing schools, even big school \nsystems, should not depend on forms of assessing children that undermine the \nvery learning schools are intended to foster. </p>\n<br/><br/>(Message over 64 KB, truncated) </a></span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14333,"nextTopicId":14638}}
