Nobody ever did that when I was growing up.  I don&#39;t know why.  It was only when someone told me it was rude and showed no respect for the other person that I changed it in myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I usually do make a bit of small talk when I&#39;m calling someone, especially when kids answer the phone.  I think I make less small talk with adults, they&#39;re not as fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think I ever taught Margaux phone ettiquette, but I love the way she speaks when she calls someone.  It usually goes<br/>\n  like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi!  This is Margaux.  Fine, thank you.  Can BJ come out to play?  mmhmm, Okay.<br/>\n  pause.....<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi BJ!  This is Margaux.  Do you want to come over?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Perhaps I should tell her to ask for BJ or whoever, but she does the same thing with everyone, even her grandparents.
