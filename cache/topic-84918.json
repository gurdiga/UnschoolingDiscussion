If it were me, I would start by<br/>\nkeeping a very simple journal/scrapbook of what you are doing each day - not<br/>\nwriting in &quot;educationese&quot;, or just what could be normally construed as<br/>\neducational activities, but everything that you do, and how you all spend<br/>\nyour time. It will give you a place to start when memory fails. When they<br/>\nare grown up won&#39;t you have fun looking back. It may also help you feel<br/>\nbetter once you realize just how much is being done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest that you ask you kids (sorry I forget their ages) for their ideas<br/>\nfor storing written pieces, art projects or other records. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I have long advocated that <br/>\neveryone try option #3 first.  Only in those few districts where the <br/>\nsuperintendents have a record of ogrely behavior will home educators <br/>\nhave a problem getting supers to agree to any number of things, <br/>\nincluding:  1) since you are the child&#39;s teacher, and are authorized <br/>\nby the state to select all his/her curriculum, administer the daily <br/>\neducational hours, assess and observe the student on a daily basis, <br/>\nthen you are, of course, the most logical person to assess your <br/>\nchild, not some teacher who you visit with a pile of papers for one <br/>\nhour (or less) once a year; 2) for older children some kind of yearly <br/>\nproject could provide a great record of your child&#39;s year of <br/>\nlearning, including a video production, a blog of learning <br/>\nexperience, a photo journalism display, or something else.  You see, <br/>\nOhio isn&#39;t so bad, once you really read the regs and understand the <br/>\npossibilities.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you have to present for the portfolio assessment option depends <br/>\nentirely on the teacher.  Our group, CATCH, a totally inclusive, non-<br/>\ndirected, community-based home ed support group, has free membership <br/>\nfor anyone, and every spring we offer a free group portfolio <br/>\nassessment event to members who join before Jan. 1 of each year (and <br/>\nwho remain members).

I have a 6 yo (who would be 1st grade), an almost 5 and a <br/>\n3 yo. I dealt with portfolio reviews through my county last year (for <br/>\nKindergarten), and my next scheduled review is early January.  We do twice <br/>\na year in Maryland, and I can tell you that it differs quite a bit here <br/>\nfrom county to county and even reviewer to reviewer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you on the no testing, if you have any say. That&#39;s a situation <br/>\nthat you absolutely don&#39;t want to set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople I know approach the review process in a couple of different ways. <br/>\nSome folks take lots of pictures and document their learning that way. <br/>\nOther folks go in with the idea of overwhelming the reviewer with <br/>\nstuff--just bring anything and everything that&#39;s of value (in the <br/>\nreviewer&#39;s eyes). In the county north of me, there is a drop-off system, <br/>\nwhich I would just hate! You drop off your portfolio and pick it up with <br/>\nteacher comments on it. That would really fire me up, like I was being <br/>\ngraded with no chance to comment or explain. GRRRRRR!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy situation is a bit different, for better or for worse. My husband and I <br/>\nboth have PhD&#39;s, so I went in with the attitude of knowing far more than <br/>\nthey do. I tossed a couple of things at my reviewer like Bose-Einstein <br/>\ncondensation, and before she knew it, her head was spinning. I think that <br/>\nmost homeschoolers could adopt this tact if they chose to (I did this, btw, <br/>\nin a very friendly and non-aggressive way). Homeschoolers learn about so <br/>\nmany interesting things in such depth that there&#39;s a very good chance that <br/>\nwe know more than ps reviewers about many things. Actually documenting <br/>\nstuff in a portfolio is kinda difficult for me as an unschooler, which is <br/>\nwhy I would really hate not having a face to face interview. I can talk <br/>\nabout all kinds of things that make it quite clear my kids have been <br/>\nexposed to interesting things and have learned a great deal even if it&#39;s <br/>\nnot documented. This past year, my reviewer was fine with the fact that ALL <br/>\nof our math and science were hands on, because I was able to describe the <br/>\nkinds of things we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering right now how this will play out in the higher grades. I&#39;m <br/>\nfiguring that I will end up switching to an umbrella school that is more <br/>\nfriendly to unschoolers. This is an option in Maryland, kind of like <br/>\nenrolling in a private school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this was helpful or if it was what you were looking for. <br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to try to answer more specific questions if you have any.<br/>\n<br/>\n--danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163443548,"authorName":"mirindia4@aol.com","from":"mirindia4@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] independent thinking","postDate":"1069221253","msgId":84981,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNC4zOWM4YWRjMC4yY2VjNWY4NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84978,"nextInTopic":84982,"prevInTime":84980,"nextInTime":84982,"topicId":84918,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i am in ohio. i know that i have to either have them take some type of state testing . like the iowa s or have someon look at a portfolio of their work. i will","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1345561811\">i am in ohio. i know that i have to either have them take some type of state <br/>\ntesting . like the iowa&#39;s or have someon look at a portfolio of their work. i <br/>\nwill not have them do the testing so that leaves the porfolio. any suggestions <br/>\nyou could give me would be greatly appreciated. thanks, pat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] independent thinking","postDate":"1069203336","msgId":84978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDEyNi4zNGMyNDAxZS4yY2ViY2RjZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":84974,"nextInTopic":84981,"prevInTime":84977,"nextInTime":84979,"topicId":84918,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pat, what state are you in?
