I am crying and processing some of the questions you posed.  I heard your tone as gentle and loving.  Thank you. It is hard to sit with those voices","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1412396118\">Hi Joyce.  I am crying and processing some of the questions you posed.  I heard your tone as gentle and loving.  Thank you. It is hard to sit with those voices from my childhood that denied any fun, that corrected me neurotically, and was always looking to &quot;DO RATHER THAN BE.&quot;  Who knew that after all the work I have done to heal from my childhood, the process of raising my daughter brings it all to light again and again (perhaps deeper).  <br/>\n<br/>\n  You said: <br/>\nIt might help you to look at why you felt you needed to say you did  <br/>\nother things beside laugh followed by you want the best for your child.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s something there that made you see laughing as not important.  <br/>\nYou want something better than happiness.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhy do you think so? Where&#39;s that coming from? Why wouldn&#39;t laughing  <br/>\nbe enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nI still have an unworthiness quietly inside that makes me feel really sad and when you asked those questions, I cried from that place.  I will be looking for awhile.  I realize they are rhetorical and meant for my contemplation. I drank and did drugs from the age of 8 until I was 20 years old.  I have a really harsh young story from which I have gotten to heal and help others.  Please don&#39;t hear this as &quot;poor me,&quot; it is just a fact of my existence.  After I got sober, however, in my early 20&#39;s, I used to ask people why they laughed at certain things because I was so wounded, I didn&#39;t understand humor.  My husband and daughter are both very funny people (THANK GOD/GODDESS) and they get things more than I do.  I do laugh now, and have since found what makes me laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the reading question, <br/>\nHow could she be a better 10 yo if she could read? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great question.  She wouldn&#39;t BE any better of a human.  She is compassionate, connected, conscious, kind, and opinionated, strong, and silly, dorky, and funny!  She can read when she wants to, already.  What happened that triggered it was my mom made a comment.  I then chose to worry again.  I did, however, send my mom sandra&#39;s link and told my mom that I have no room for doubting my unschooling choice.  I told her that I cannot make her feel comfortable with my unschooling method.  I shared with her that when I feel worried, I read www.sandradodd.com.  Then, I went ahead and fancied the fears.  They are still in me or she would not trigger me.  I am not blaming my mom, I am owning that I still have work to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough this process, I am seeing how attached I have become to the outcome.  I have ulterior motives when unschooling.  I am constantly reporting that she did a schooly thing because I left her alone.  I am seeing how weird I can be about achievement and outcome.  Besides my attachments to the way life &quot;should&quot; look.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany things that you posed are hard to sit with, yet worth it.  I am truly being unschooled and decompressing myself.  School was a safe place for me.  I loved school when I was a little girl.   I was raped in 7th grade before going to high school and the rapist was not supposed to go to the high school I went to, but he walked past me the first day of school.  I was terrified, and moved schools.  In high school, I dropped out and did private study at my own pace.  I read my first book a year after I got sober at age 21.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the second day in a row, I have actually turned on the TV before my daughter has gotten up.  After I write this, I am going to enjoy a cooking show.  Thank you again Joyce.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n <br/>\n&gt; On Feb 14, 2011, at 3:32 PM, Kathleen wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The unschooling way of life comes natural to many of you, but I have  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; had to work at it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Confidence has a way of making it look as if someone finds something  <br/>\n&gt; easy!

She is an only child. I am married AND I have to work. We set it up so that Hannah is with me or my husband. I work 20 hours per week. Sat (5), Sun (5), and Mon (10).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, the past 7 weeks, we went through a very difficult eczema situation with my daughter. I chose to miss my regular AA meetings as I am 19 years sober. It felt right to be there for her because she asked me to. I plum wore myself out and stopped doing self care basics, so I am writing this from a very tired state of mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, I have never been one to watch TV, but my hubby and daughter love it. So, I have decompressed, relaxed and watched tons of, &quot;The Office&quot; with my daughter. We have done other things while watching besides laughing.  I do want the best for my child. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that said, my problem is: I think things should be different.
