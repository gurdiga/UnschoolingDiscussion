Maybe he&#39;s here, that <br/>\n  would be interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, he said something in P/CP that was shocking to me then, but I&#39;ve <br/>\n  thought about it for years and years and I believe he&#39;s right.  Maybe <br/>\n  someone else can remember his whole argument, but this is the part I <br/>\n  remember the most.  He said that (paraphrasing from long ago) teaching <br/>\n  was an immoral act, because it was an attempt to control the thoughts of <br/>\n  others.  His arguments for this were very compelling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  And he is a teacher by profession, too, which makes his thoughts even <br/>\n  more interesting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Tuck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the Moderator, Joyce Fetteroll, at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n  Your use of Yahoo!
