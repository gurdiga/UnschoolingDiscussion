Let me try this again!<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>\n&gt;  experienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of <br/>\n&gt;  facilitating<br/>\n&gt; learning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the same  for all<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do you  generally go<br/>\n&gt; about digging up possible resources that your kids might be  interested <br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or  thinking up ways they <br/>\n&gt; might<br/>\n&gt; enjoy expanding those  interests.  And how much do you leave up to <br/>\n&gt; them?  Is<br/>\n&gt;  this something that has varied over your years of unschooling with <br/>\n&gt;  insight<br/>\n&gt; you have gained in the process of unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>THESE are  really good questions that hit right at the center of what <br/>\nmakes unschooling  what it is. The easy quick answer is that the <br/>\nparents&#39; role varies depending  on the child (and on the parent).  I <br/>\nthink &quot;pretty much the same for  all unschoolers&quot; would be a very <br/>\nmisleading answer. My role isn&#39;t the same  even for my three kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I bet there are some genera principles  that all unschoolers <br/>\nabide by and maybe together we can come up with a  useful list.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the role of the unschooling parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Show  respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>\n2. Keep the child in mind as  I go through life, so that I notice things <br/>\nthat might be of interest to that  child.<br/>\n3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a more  <br/>\n&quot;open-book&quot; life than the norm.<br/>\n4. Follow up on things the child is  interested in - and do this in a <br/>\nwide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting  him a book on it.&quot;<br/>\n5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a  variety of <br/>\nkinds both at home and outside the home.<br/>\n6. Have resources  around the home that are interesting and stimulating <br/>\n- things that will  encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>\n7. Discuss things - spend time in  conversation. This is probably <br/>\noverall the most important parental &quot;action&quot;  involved in unschooling.<br/>\n8. Have a &#39;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have  fun, appreciate the <br/>\namazing world around ou. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to  be amazed and <br/>\nfind the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most important  <br/>\n&quot;attitude&quot; for an unschooling parent.<br/>\n9. Be self-aware of your own  thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch <br/>\nyour imagination - question your  own assumptions, check your own <br/>\nautomatic impulses.<br/>\n10. Be very observant  of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view <br/>\nhim/her in a shallow  superficial way. Recognize that there is a reason <br/>\nfor a child&#39;s actions,  that a child is &#39;born to learn&#39; and is always <br/>\nlearning. Get to know your  child&#39;s own special favored ways of learning<br/>\n11. Wholeheartedly support a  child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t look like  &quot;education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education  Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community  since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public  relations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Fwd: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro & Question","postDate":"1086191962","msgId":94969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOC4yMWZlNzk1Zi4yZGVmNTM1YUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":94971,"prevInTime":94968,"nextInTime":94970,"topicId":94969,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From the new roups, but I thought it might be of interest here too.
