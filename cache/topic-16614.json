It was easier to stick to feeding them<br/>\nhealthier when I wasn&#39;t around any family...but alas.<br/>\nGrammas and grampas are made for spoiling and giving<br/>\ncookies and we are currently living with my mom and<br/>\nsisters who like having junk food around the house.<br/>\n(not to say that I&#39;m not myself a Pepsi-holic...but<br/>\nthat&#39;s utterly beside the point.)<br/>\nSome things that I have done and have really helped<br/>\nare<br/>\n<br/>\n*feeding ds plenty of protein (I can&#39;t do that no<br/>\nwheat thing either...)<br/>\nex: eggs and bacon (we are bacon freaks...just can&#39;t<br/>\nget enough of the stuff...)in the morning.<br/>\nhe did sooo well (hyperactivity wise) when he had an<br/>\negg every morning and lots of peanut butter...<br/>\n<br/>\n*giving them things that i still treat like sweets<br/>\n(just as a reverse psychology thing, though) and that<br/>\nthey still love like sweets...like arrowroot cookies<br/>\nfrom Wild Oats (health food store) that have molasses<br/>\nand honey..etc... in them. they&#39;re small so I can give<br/>\nthem lots of them..they feel special and I know it<br/>\nstill isn&#39;t as bad for them as a candy bar. <br/>\n<br/>\n*I give them &quot;special juice coke&quot; (though at first I<br/>\nhad to call it &quot;kid coke&quot; or soemthing cuz they didn&#39;t<br/>\nlike that whole &quot;juice instead of coke&quot; thing..<br/>\nI buy juicy juice (no added sugar) concentrate (not<br/>\nfrozen, in coke-like cans) and mix it with club soda<br/>\nor something like that (just carbonated water with no<br/>\nsugar...instead of with water) and they get the fizzy<br/>\npart and no corn syrup and artificial color<br/>\nstuff...wacky straws help.<br/>\n<br/>\n*peanut butter balls....they have peanut butter, dy<br/>\nmilk, rice cereal, coconut, and honey... you roll them<br/>\ninto balls and refrigerate them...they are super<br/>\nsweet, but still only good for you stuff in them. they<br/>\ngo fast though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read lots about all the different things to do<br/>\nfor &quot;ADD&quot; sorts of stuff...my ds isn&#39;t neccesarily<br/>\n&quot;hyper&quot; allll the time...soemtimes he just can&#39;t<br/>\nconcentrate...I believe that what people (whoever they<br/>\nare) have termed &quot;ADD/ADHD&quot; is in fact a medical<br/>\nproblem and my ex suffered from it alot....pycnogenol<br/>\nhelped him...but can&#39;t give that to kids...wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthink of ritalin... <br/>\nso I&#39;ve read alot about diet...Essential Fatty Acids<br/>\nhelp alot if they are abundant in the diet...and<br/>\ninterestingly raw sugar..in a pure form doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nkids hyper...it&#39;s actually a sedative. in some places<br/>\nthey give kids sugar cane to suck on to calm them. (I<br/>\ntried it once) but ARTIFICIAL sweeteners and additives<br/>\nare what mess things up. Now, I&#39;m not one to talk as<br/>\nmy kids learned how to say &quot;&#39;donald&#39;s, mommy, peez?&quot;<br/>\nbefore they learned to say &quot;apple&quot; but I have gone<br/>\nthru times where we really stuck to a diet of eating<br/>\neven just LESS of the artificial stuff and sweets and<br/>\nI noticed a huge difference. Oh! A good book is &quot;meals<br/>\nthat heal for toddlers&quot;.... or something like that.<br/>\nhas alot of good info in it about how different foods<br/>\naffect kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah. also, I try to give them sweets that seems<br/>\nlike more than it is. like mini m&ms, mini donuts,<br/>\nwhen we make cookies we make them really small,<br/>\nvanilla wafers....etc, etc...<br/>\nor I fry bananas in honey to put on thier ice<br/>\ncream....<br/>\nand put lots and lots of nuts on it. (the nuts have<br/>\nefa&#39;s) they are still getting &quot;ice cream&quot; but the<br/>\nfruit and nuts almost out weigh it. <br/>\ntrying to tell them sweets were bad for them and no<br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t have them just made them try to sneak<br/>\nsome from gramma.<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO, they love sleepytime tea. with lots of honey.<br/>\n<br/>\nthere are also some recipes for homemade fruit rollups<br/>\nthat you can use fresh fruit and non-artificial<br/>\ningredients in. That is, assuming you have time. :)<br/>\nhope some of that is useful. <br/>\n-Bobbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
