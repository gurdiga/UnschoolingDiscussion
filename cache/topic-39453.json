If he doesn&#39;t know a word, but can keep the movie <br/>\ngoing, he just skips it. (He&#39;s skipping less and less words anymore BTW.) If <br/>\nhe really needs the word to understand the story he just asks me. (This <br/>\nhardly ever happens anymore either.)

That&#39;s what phonics<br/>\nmeans -- the sounds of letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginning readers need to learn the letters&#39; names and the sounds they stand<br/>\nfor. &quot;A&quot; has more than one sound -- &quot;A&quot; as is hat, and &quot;a&quot; as in age or<br/>\nbaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nE sounds like the &quot;e&quot; in bed, or the &quot;e&quot; in meet.  I has two sounds. One is<br/>\nin words like HIT, the other is in words like BITE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought plastic letters with magnets on the back and made short words on<br/>\nthe refrigerator, such as AT. Next day, I changed it to CAT, then RAT, then<br/>\nRAM. Same with HOT, POT, LOT, LOG...<br/>\n<br/>\nUP changed to CUP, then ZUP (just for fun) -- Dr. Seuss stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIT, SIT, SIP, RIP, DIP, DRIP, SKIP, STIK. spelling doesn&#39;t need to be<br/>\ncorrect so long as the child understands that letters mean sounds. Make up<br/>\nnonsense words just to make the point -- ZARK.  BAM.  WUG...  They get it<br/>\nvery quickly usually. It becomes a game...maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nPS  As much as I like Sam Blumenfeld, 100 &quot;easy lessons&quot; doesn&#39;t sound easy<br/>\nto me. It sounds like school. Try to do this with NO lessons, just fun. I<br/>\nalways remember that one child, when asked how he learned to read, he said,<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know. I just learned &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; and I could read.&quot;<br/>\nIt&#39;s only schools that want us to believe that it takes a long time to teach<br/>\na child to read, and that it&#39;s difficult. It doesn&#39;t, and it isn&#39;t. Contrary<br/>\nto what they say, English is incredibly regular and simple...26 letters and<br/>\nonly 44 sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext is to divide longer words into short ones called syllables. The<br/>\nsyllables can be read separately...that&#39;s &quot;sounding out&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n Once a child understands the connection between letters and sounds, s/he&#39;s<br/>\ngot it. If he/she can read short words and very short sentences, such as,<br/>\nJim sat on a red box, they are reading.<br/>\nIn my experience with our son during his early years, walking around town<br/>\nand reading signs was, I believe, a good start. Not only did it make the<br/>\nconnection between words and real activities ( BANK means money changing,<br/>\nand BOOK STORE is a place that keeps books) but it made learning reading<br/>\nincidental to living, instead of a separate, disconnected experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else we did was make signs (3x5&quot; or so) taped to household items<br/>\n-- pan, window, rug, wall, door, refrigerator, table. It doesn&#39;t take long.<br/>\nPretty soon, the child might make a sign for something. At that point, s/he<br/>\nis reading AND writing. You&#39;re home free.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick is knowing when to stop this type of teaching. Keep it minimal.<br/>\nOnce a child gets it, it&#39;s time to stop &quot;teaching.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39494,"nextTopicId":39510}}
