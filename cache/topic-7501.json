My two oldest children are<br/>\nworking on a SpaceDay Challenge for NASA that involves the International<br/>\nSpace Station.  Our problem is that they can not be considered for judging<br/>\nunless they have four students work on the project.  Well, my two youngest<br/>\nare 1 and 4 so that won&#39;t work for us.  Do any of you have children who<br/>\nwould be in grades 4-6 that would like to participate with my children on<br/>\nthis project?  There is only one day left and we are getting desparate.  My<br/>\nson and daughter have developed what they believe is a solution to a<br/>\ncommunications challenge and published their Flash presentation at:<br/>\nwww.rjsinternational.com/spaceday .  Would you please take a look and if you<br/>\nhave children in the needed age group (NASA&#39;s rules, not ours), please<br/>\ncontact us ASAP.  You may also call us at (954) 776-5644.<br/>\n<br/>\nTIA - RJS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7505,"nextTopicId":7507}}
