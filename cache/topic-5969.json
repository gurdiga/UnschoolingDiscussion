I&#39;m looking for suggestions for great plays to do.  We have some ideas, but none of them seem quite right at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n   In the past we&#39;ve done: Little Women; Filthaven&#39;s Folly (a melodrama); A Christmas Carol; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Cinderella, Charlotte&#39;s Web; Anne of Green Gables; Tales from the Arabian Nights and Cheaper by the Dozen.  Each one has been a truly wonderful experience.  Does reading this list bring to mind other plays you&#39;d like to see?  We&#39;d like to include a lot of kids this time, so it needs to be something that can be expanded.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Anyone else out there with a hs theater group?<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5924,"nextTopicId":5985}}
