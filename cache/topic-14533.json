Here are some notes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are really only a handful of important attitudes and skills essential <br/>\nto parenting. The catch is that those comprise some of the most profound and <br/>\ncourageous challenges we can ever give ourselves; they have to do with our <br/>\nability and our willingness to grow and change all the days of our <br/>\nlives...Nothing in nature is more complex, more mysterious, than human <br/>\nbeings... We need to examine those times when our children &quot;drive us crazy.&quot; <br/>\nThis often occurs when they do things that we were not allowed to do when we <br/>\nwere children ... when they are not as repressed as we were...when they won&#39;t <br/>\ndo things that we were forced to do when we were children; because we are <br/>\ngreen with envy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you become a parent it is your biggest chance to grow again.
