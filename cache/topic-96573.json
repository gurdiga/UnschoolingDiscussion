The baby likes me a lot, and is pretty suspicious of <br/>\nHolly&#39;s motives and abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got up early today, after a night of weird dreams including finding two <br/>\nnew rooms in our house.  (Those dreams are common, fun and irritating for me.) <br/>\n And it had rained, and I surveyed some little damage, and accepted <br/>\nbaby-delivery.  Read e-mail with the baby on my lap directing my hands on the keyboard. <br/>\n  She can sit now, and inspired by the dream, I gave her some toys and was <br/>\ncleaning out one of my storage rooms.  Finding lots of late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s <br/>\nwritings and letters and photos.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went in back and took a long nap with Pride and Prejudice on.  Kirby came <br/>\nto tell me he was going to work (a morning meeting).    I finally woke up <br/>\nthinking...  Hank Azaria as Riff Raff...   in the Holy Grail!?   DARN IT.  I had <br/>\nimagined a nice Rocky Horror production without remembering we weren&#39;t talking <br/>\nabout Rocky Horror anymore. &lt;g&gt;  So hours later, I&#39;m saying &quot;Never mind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t help my confusion that one of the things I found and re-filed this <br/>\nmorning was the bag from when we saw it live.  They had printed &quot;lips&quot; on it, <br/>\nand Holly saved hers.  In my junk room. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo sorry... back to asking the right questions.<br/>\nAbout this Holy Grail musical...
