You have to really watch the breeding, as they have been overbred some<br/>\nand have had problems with rage and hip dysplastia.  Howevever, if you&#39;re<br/>\nbuying from a long-time, reputable breeder, you hopefully should have no<br/>\nproblem.  Or, if you get a shelter dog of mixed breed, you might want to<br/>\nlook for one with some springer spaniel in it.  They are wonderful,<br/>\nintelligent, loving animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44966,"nextTopicId":45114}}
