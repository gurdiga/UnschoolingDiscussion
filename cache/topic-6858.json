I live in New York.<br/>\nIf there is anyone who lives in NY or has regs similar to NY, could you<br/>\nplease give me an idea of what type of format you use for your qtrly<br/>\nreports and yr end written narrative. I started out trying to duplicate<br/>\nschool, which made qtrlies easier. I have found that unschooling is the<br/>\nbest route for us, but now I am a little confused as to how to document<br/>\nand report. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
