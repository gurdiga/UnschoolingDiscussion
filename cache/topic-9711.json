I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating<br/>\nas they were to me. The call was from AT&T and it went something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: Hello.<br/>\nAT&T: Hello, this is AT&T...<br/>\nMe: Is this AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>\nMe: This is AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes. This is AT&T...<br/>\nMe: Is this AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: YES! This is AT&T, may I speak to Mr. Byron please?<br/>\nMe: May I ask who is calling?<br/>\nAT&T: This is AT&T.<br/>\nMe: OK, hold on.<br/>\nAt this point I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that,<br/>\nsurely, this person would have hung up the phone. Much to my surprise, when<br/>\nI picked up the receiver, they were still waiting.<br/>\nMe: Hello?<br/>\nAT&T: Is this Mr. Byron?<br/>\nMe: May I ask who is calling please?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>\nMe: Is this AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>\nMe: This is AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, is this Mr. Byron?<br/>\nMe: Yes, is this AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>\nMe: The phone company?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>\nMe: I thought you said this was AT&T.<br/>\nAT&T: Yes sir, we are a phone company.<br/>\nMe: I already have a phone.<br/>\nAT&T: We aren&#39;t selling phones today, Mr. Byron.<br/>\nMe: Well, whatever it is, I&#39;m really not interested but thanks for calling.<br/>\nWhen you are not interested in something, I don&#39;t think you can express<br/>\nyourself any plainer than by saying, &quot;I&#39;m really not interested&quot;, but this<br/>\nlady was persistent.<br/>\nAT&T: Mr. Byron, we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a<br/>\nday, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.   Now, I am sure she meant she was<br/>\noffering a &quot;rate&quot; of 10 cents a minute but she at no time used the word<br/>\nrate. I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old<br/>\ncalculator and do a little ciphering.<br/>\nMe: Now, that&#39;s 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day?<br/>\nAT&T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes, sir,<br/>\nthat&#39;s right! 24 hours a day!<br/>\nMe: 7 days a week?<br/>\nAT&T: That&#39;s right.<br/>\nMe: 365 days a year?<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>\nMe: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!!! That&#39;s amazing!<br/>\nAT&T: We think so!<br/>\nMe: That&#39;s quite a sum of money!<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, sir, it&#39;s amazing how it adds up.<br/>\nMe: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at<br/>\nthe end of the year for the full $52,560, and if you send an annual check,<br/>\ncan I get a cash advance?<br/>\nAT&T: Excuse me?<br/>\nMe: You know, the 10 cents a minute.<br/>\nAT&T: What are you talking about?<br/>\nMe: You said you&#39;d give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,<br/>\n365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1008 per week and $52,560 per<br/>\nyear. I&#39;m just interested in knowing how you will be making payment.<br/>\nAT&T: Oh, no, sir. I didn&#39;t mean we&#39;d be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a<br/>\nminute.<br/>\nMe: Wait a minute here!!! Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;d give me 10 cents a minute.<br/>\nAre you sure this is AT&T?<br/>\nAT&T: Well, yes, this is AT&T, sir, but......<br/>\nMe: But nothing. How do you figure that by saying that you&#39;ll give me 10<br/>\ncents a minute that I&#39;ll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of<br/>\nsubliminal telemarketing scheme? I&#39;ve read about things like this in the<br/>\nEnquirer, you know. Don&#39;t use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.<br/>\nAT&T: No, sir, we are offering 10 cents a minute for.....<br/>\nMe: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please!<br/>\nAT&T: Sir, I don&#39;t think that is necessary.<br/>\nMe: Sure! You say that now! What happens later?<br/>\nAT&T: What?<br/>\nMe: I insist on speaking to a supervisor!<br/>\nAT&T: Yes, Mr. Byron. Please hold.<br/>\nSo now AT&T has me on hold and my supper is getting cold. I begin to eat<br/>\nwhile I&#39;m waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and while<br/>\nI have a mouth full of food:<br/>\nSupervisor: Mr. Byron?<br/>\nMe: Yeth?<br/>\nSupervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents a<br/>\nminute program.<br/>\nMe: Id thish Ath Teeth & Teeth?<br/>\nSupervisor: Yes, sir, it sure is.<br/>\nI had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to<br/>\nsuppress my laughter and I had to be careful not to produce a snort.<br/>\n Me: No, actually, I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so that<br/>\nI could sign up for the plan.<br/>\nSupervisor: OK, no problem, I&#39;ll transfer you back to the person who was<br/>\nhelping you.<br/>\nMe: Thank you.<br/>\nI was on hold once again and was getting really hungry. I needed to end this<br/>\nconversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite voice at the<br/>\nother end of the phone.<br/>\nAT&T: Hello, Mr. Byron, I understand that you are interested in signing up<br/>\nfor our plan?<br/>\nMe: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never have<br/>\nenough friends and I&#39;m an only child and I&#39;d really like to have a little<br/>\nbrother...<br/>\nAT&T: (click)&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9596,"nextTopicId":9712}}
