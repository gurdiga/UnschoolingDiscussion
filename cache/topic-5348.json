The first session wasn&#39;t too bad...the instructor was<br/>\npretty good about leaving a kid be if he or she didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nparticipate in something and wanted to do something else.  I found the<br/>\ncrafts to be developmentally inappropriate....but all they usually<br/>\nconsisted of was something like &quot;paste this on here&quot; then it was done so<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t too bothered by it.  Logan seemed to enjoy it so we signed up<br/>\nfor the next 6 week session.  There was a different instructor this time<br/>\nand she had a way of making what I think she thought were funny comments<br/>\nabout the one or two children who chose to run around the gym or<br/>\nwhatever instead of participating in &quot;circle time&quot;.  This really<br/>\nbothered me, but since she didn&#39;t actually interfere with Logan and he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t hear the comments we continued for the rest of the session.  We<br/>\ndidn&#39;t go back because I figured that he&#39;d eventually pick up on the<br/>\nattitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo on I went to find a different program and ended up trying out<br/>\nGymboree.  We went for a free trial class and I really loved what I<br/>\nsaw.  Parents stayed with the children and the children were free to<br/>\nexplore any and all of the equipment that was set up (boy I wish they<br/>\nhad this for grown ups!).  During the class the instructor would have<br/>\nparachute time, songs with rhythm instruments, and other games going on<br/>\nin the middle of the room.  The kids were truly free to choose their own<br/>\nactivity.  The instructor would come around singing with bubbles and<br/>\ngreet all the children at some point during each class, too.  We did one<br/>\n10 week session there, but then our life changed a bit- my dh got a new<br/>\njob and Logan ended up going to day care from 1:30 to 4 every day (I had<br/>\nbeen working full time on second shift).  We really couldn&#39;t afford to<br/>\ncontinue and barely had the time to either.  I&#39;m quite sad that we<br/>\nstopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that we&#39;re home together again Logan seems to want more time with<br/>\nother kids.  Unfortunately Gymboree programs in our area only go up to<br/>\nage 4...Logan will be 5 in January.  I&#39;m going to look into our local<br/>\nunschoolers group (there is one, yay!) to see if there are any<br/>\nactivities going on with the kids and possibly organize some if there<br/>\naren&#39;t.  I dread the idea of trying a YMCA program for him again because<br/>\nI&#39;m sure as kids get older they just try to impose more structure.<br/>\nThere is a gymnastics program I might look into nearby...but for some<br/>\nreason I have a feeling its not what I&#39;m looking for.  If only we could<br/>\njust go to the playground during the day (which we do)- unfortunately we<br/>\ndon&#39;t seem to find any other kids there and Logan is craving some sort<br/>\nof kid interaction.  He has a great time when he sees my kid brothers<br/>\nand when we get together with my extended family, but its just not<br/>\nenough for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo its probably a case now where I have to create what we want...but I<br/>\nwill recommend Gymboree programs for parents of toddlers (and it<br/>\nprobably does depend on the instructor!) because we had a great<br/>\nexperience there.  But I agree with Diane...most &quot;children&#39;s activity<br/>\nclasses&quot; are terrible!<br/>\n<br/>\nLesley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18878,"nextTopicId":18899}}
