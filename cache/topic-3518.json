Well, unfortunately I felt the need to move 9 hours away from my parents on purpose.� When the opportunity arose, I jumped on it.� I also have� no desire to go visit their house any time in the near future.� Since we moved in March, they have already been out to visit us once, for a weekend.� That is about all that I can handle of them, one weekend in MY house, MY rules.<br/>\n&gt; They are much easier for me, and DH, to handle that way.� I make sure that my kids know who they are, talk to them on the phone and have a positive image of them and relationship with them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now I am using my energy to work on stability and growth in our immediate family.� I do not have the energy or desire left right now to work on the relationship with my parents.� It is always very one sided, and I cannot forgive their past behavior when they continue it every time I see/talk to them.� I know that they are not going to change, and I am not<br/>\n&gt; willing to accept their abuse.� Even my DH does not like to spend time with them, although they are usually nice to him.� He does not enjoy watching them torture me.� He will often ask my dad, after he has goaded me into getting really upset (ONCE AGAIN) &quot;Why do you do that to her??&quot;� Of course<br/>\n&gt; he knows the reasons.� It&#39;s a power trip for him.� But that doesn&#39;t make it hurt less or be less upsetting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For us, the distance is a blessing.� It enables us to maintain (mostly) peaceful relations, if sparing in frequency.� It enables the boys to maintain a positive image of their grandparents while they are little.� It does not allow my parents to interfere with my child rearing, degrade my self esteem, judge me, emotionally abuse my children in the same ways they did me, etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now, my inlaws are completely another story.� They are coming for a long weekend in mid Oct. and we can all hardly wait.� They are very affectionate grandparents and very down-to-earth people.� We would really enjoy seeing more of them in our lives, but they live near my parents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;
