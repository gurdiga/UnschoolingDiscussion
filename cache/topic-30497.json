I am constantly having to count the number of carbohydrates <br/>\nhe ingests to keep his diabetes under very tight control.  There are <br/>\nmany times when he just hasn&#39;t had enough carbos for lunch or dinner and <br/>\nI have to insist he eats a piece of fruit, cookie, or candy.  Sometimes <br/>\nhe&#39;ll complain bitterly, but he knows he has to do it or he may go low <br/>\nand have a seizure.  His twin, Paul, is not a diabetic.  I don&#39;t control <br/>\nwhat or how much he eats whatsoever.   It often seems so unfair to Leroy <br/>\nthat I constantly have to keep an eye out on what he eats, the amounts <br/>\nhe eats and at what time he eats.  It really is very stressful.     But, <br/>\nit is done to maintain his physical well-being and to avoid <br/>\ncomplications in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Monday, December 31, 2001, at 02:14 PM, carolyn wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Well, I&#39;m not rich but....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dd was going through a real craving for sugar in any form.
