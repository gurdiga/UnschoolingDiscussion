Read it again! It IS poetry, <br/>\nlike life is poetry, too, and to be fully enjoyed!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read <br/>\nsomething-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>\nLook up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>\nLife is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>\nBe, see, climb a tree.<br/>\nBeyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>\nLife is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>\nAnd the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>\n---<br/>\nNancy or Brandy or Mildred, probably Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n   Soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre,<br/>\nbut they are more deadly in the long run. --- Mark Twain</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2527,"nextTopicId":2612}}
