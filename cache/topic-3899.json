Please grab a blanket and<br/>\n prepare for some more chill bumps....<br/>\n <br/>\n GOD USED A TOOTHACHE<br/>\n <br/>\n Friday morning I was reading the paper and noticed Darrell Scott (father of<br/>\n Rachel Scott, a student who was killed at Columbine High School) was coming<br/>\n to<br/>\n speak Sunday afternoon at Two Rivers Baptist Church in Nashville.<br/>\n <br/>\n I really wanted to go hear what Mr. Scott had to say but was a little<br/>\n apprehensive about announcing anything to my youth group about the event<br/>\n since<br/>\n it was going to be held at a Baptist church.  I had a feeling someone would<br/>\n get<br/>\n offended if I promoted it.  So, instead of any announcement in the main<br/>\n worship<br/>\n assembly, at the end of my Sunday school class I made mention of the event,<br/>\n told<br/>\n my high school kids I&#39;d be going and invited anyone to ride with me who<br/>\n wanted<br/>\n to go.<br/>\n <br/>\n I expected to take two or three kids in my truck.  Instead I ended up having<br/>\n to<br/>\n fire up the White House Church of Christ van as 11 of us made the short trek<br/>\n to<br/>\n Two Rivers.<br/>\n <br/>\n I wish I could have recorded the looks on the faces of everyone we passed in<br/>\n the<br/>\n parking lot at Two Rivers as our van, with all its Church of Christ<br/>\n lettering,<br/>\n motored to a resting place.  Shock.  Disbelief.Happiness.  I&#39;d be a rich man<br/>\n if I had a dime for every person I saw mouthing the words, &quot;Church of<br/>\n Christ??????&quot; as we passed.<br/>\n <br/>\n I guess we broke traditional protocol, but we had a face-to-face meeting<br/>\n with<br/>\n God we would never have had if we hadn&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\n The service was unbelievable.  Just five short months after the April 20<br/>\n tragedy, Mr. Scott shared the &quot;untold&quot; stories from Columbine, the stories<br/>\n the<br/>\n liberal media may never tell, the stories he has dedicated every waking<br/>\n moment<br/>\n of the rest of his life to sharing.  He talked at length about the 12<br/>\n students, including his daughter Rachel, who left this world on April 20.<br/>\n <br/>\n Of the 12 students who died, eight professed to be Christians.<br/>\n As Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (the two gunmen) came down the hill behind<br/>\n the<br/>\n school to begin their assault, their first target was Mark Taylor.  At the<br/>\n very<br/>\n moment bullets pierced Mark&#39;s body, he was witnessing to two of his friends<br/>\n about his relationship with Jesus Christ.<br/>\n <br/>\n They next turned their guns on Rachel.  Three weeks earlier Rachel had<br/>\n witnessed<br/>\n to Dylan and Eric and warned them about the violent video games to which<br/>\n they<br/>\n seemed to be addicted.  Their first shot hit Rachel in the leg.<br/>\n A second plowed through her backpack into her midsection, knocking her to<br/>\n the<br/>\n ground.  One of the gunmen walked over to where Rachel lay face down, still<br/>\n alive.  He pulled her up by the hair of her head and asked, &quot;Do you still<br/>\n believe in God?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;You know that I do,&quot; Rachel managed to reply.<br/>\n <br/>\n Immediately after her reply a bullet entered her temple.<br/>\n <br/>\n Mr. Scott shared the story of John Tomlin, another victim.  John had been on<br/>\n mission trips to Mexico and was hungry to do more.  During each school day<br/>\n he<br/>\n decided to do something small in hopes it might cause someone to think about<br/>\n spiritual things.  He left his Bible open in the dash of his truck.<br/>\n <br/>\n At 4 a.m. one morning after the tragedy, Mr. Scott looked around as he was<br/>\n beginning an interview with NBC&#39;s Maria Shriver and noticed a circle of<br/>\n people<br/>\n around John&#39;s truck, talking about the Bible in the dash.<br/>\n <br/>\n Mr. Scott spoke of his son, Craig, who escaped death after looking down the<br/>\n barrel of a gun.  He escaped because his friend crouched next to him in the<br/>\n library, Isaiah Shoels, was black and a more desirable target for the two<br/>\n gunmen<br/>\n who hurled numerous racial slurs and putdowns in his direction before<br/>\n killing<br/>\n him execution-style.<br/>\n <br/>\n Cassie Bernall&#39;s story has received more national attention.  She too<br/>\n answered<br/>\n the gunmen&#39;s question of &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; in the affirmative, taking<br/>\n a<br/>\n bullet after her response.  A national &quot;She Said Yes&quot; campaign has resulted<br/>\n from the statements she and Rachel made, looking down the barrel of a gun.<br/>\n <br/>\n Rachel&#39;s funeral was broadcast in its entirety on CNN.  Millions of viewers<br/>\n tuned in, making it the highest-rated broadcast in network history.  With<br/>\n millions of eyes tuned to the broadcast, Bruce Porter brought the message,<br/>\n asking &quot;Who will take the torch?&quot; referring to the torch Rachel, Cassie,<br/>\n John,<br/>\n Mark and others had dropped.<br/>\n <br/>\n At that very moment a young man in Texas had a gun to his head, ready to<br/>\n take<br/>\n his own life.  As he listened to Porter&#39;s plea and thoughts that followed,<br/>\n he<br/>\n lowered the gun from his head, began to cry and prayed for forgiveness.<br/>\n <br/>\n Not long ago he ran 1,000 miles from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington,<br/>\n D.C.<br/>\n with a torch in his hand.<br/>\n <br/>\n Needless to say, by the end of the service I had been on an emotional roller<br/>\n coaster. My shirt had a hefty salt deposit in it from the tears I had shed,<br/>\n but<br/>\n I left the service encouraged, excited and ready to share the &quot;untold&quot;<br/>\n stories with anyone I could.<br/>\n <br/>\n We all climbed back in our van and headed back to White House.  We were<br/>\n going to<br/>\n be just in time for Sunday night services.  I kept thinking on the way back<br/>\n how<br/>\n much I would have loved to share with the congregation that night just a<br/>\n tiny<br/>\n bit of what we had experienced at Two Rivers that afternoon.  I was a bit<br/>\n discouraged because I didn&#39;t know how long it would be before I was in the<br/>\n pulpit again and had a chance to share.<br/>\n <br/>\n As I walked in the door, two minutes before services were to begin, one of<br/>\n our<br/>\n elders pulled me aside and asked, &quot;Has anyone said anything to you about<br/>\n speaking tonight?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;No,&quot; I said.<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Well Keith (our preacher) has a bad toothache.  He&#39;s not going to be able<br/>\n to<br/>\n speak.  I guess we&#39;ll just have a song service....&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Please let me speak,&quot; I butted in.  &quot;Something happened to me this<br/>\n afternoon<br/>\n I&#39;ve got to share.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Okay, you&#39;re on,&quot; he said.<br/>\n <br/>\n During the opening moments of the service I prayed fervently that God would<br/>\n use<br/>\n my words to help someone realize their need for Jesus.<br/>\n <br/>\n As I began to share some of the stories previously mentioned in this email,<br/>\n I<br/>\n felt a peace and strength I have never felt before.  It was not me talking<br/>\n up<br/>\n there.  Even though I had zero preparation for this &quot;sermon&quot; my words seemed<br/>\n to<br/>\n flow like never before.  Everything was coming together.<br/>\n In sports terms, I was &quot;in the zone.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n I pleaded with the young people who had never committed their lives to Jesus<br/>\n to<br/>\n do so.  I told them they didn&#39;t have to know everything at first.<br/>\n That&#39;s what being born again is all about.  Starting new.  I encouraged<br/>\n those<br/>\n who had given their lives to Jesus before and didn&#39;t have him at the center<br/>\n of<br/>\n their lives to make it right.<br/>\n <br/>\n As I stepped down from the pulpit with the words of &quot;Just As I Am&quot;<br/>\n resonating from the walls, I knew something special was about to happen.<br/>\n <br/>\n A teenager came forward, then an 8-year old boy, then a mother, another<br/>\n teenager, and another, and on and on.....<br/>\n <br/>\n Three came to commit their lives to Jesus for the first time and be<br/>\n baptized.<br/>\n Several others came to recommit their lives to Jesus.  They came largely<br/>\n because<br/>\n of the stories associated with 12 young people from a tiny town in Colorado.<br/>\n <br/>\n It only occurred to me about an hour later as I sat in Subway eating a<br/>\n sandwich<br/>\n there was something special about the number of people who had responded at<br/>\n church that night.<br/>\n <br/>\n There were 12.<br/>\n <br/>\n &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his<br/>\n friends.<br/>\n You are my friends if you do what I command.  I no longer call you servants,<br/>\n because a servant does not know his master&#39;s business.  Instead I have<br/>\n called<br/>\n you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known<br/>\n to<br/>\n you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear<br/>\n fruit - fruit that will last.  Then the Father will give you whatever you<br/>\n ask in<br/>\n my name. This is my command: Love each other.&quot; - John<br/>\n 15:13-17<br/>\n <br/>\n In HIM,<br/>\n <br/>\n Brent High, Youth Minister White House Church of Christ White House, TN<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Blessings,<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nTeacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\nprotector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n<br/>\n        I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>\n        I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>\n     Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. <br/>\ns.<br/>\n            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Shelly&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sturashoff@...\">sturashoff@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 13<br/>\n   Date: Thu, 14 Oct 1999 16:56:39 -0500<br/>\n   From: &quot;Kelly Jeffcoat&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeffcoat@...\">jeffcoat@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: God Used a Toothache<br/>\n<br/>\nI received this in the email a few weeks ago and just now read it.
