I have to <br/>\nsay perhaps this accident has a deeper purpose, meaning some cosmic <br/>\nintervention of sorts, that at the moment seems a large hurdle, but in the long run will <br/>\nbe something that may have slowed you and yours down for a wonderous reason. <br/>\nYou have by no means &quot;ruined&quot; the summer for your family. Maybe you will end <br/>\nup having the time of your lives and everyone will remember it as the summer <br/>\nmom broke her arm, thereby marking the impression that much more. So as hard as <br/>\nit is to see now, I will hope for you that this summer will still be great and <br/>\nthings you may have been in too fast of motion to see before will have <br/>\ngreater clarity now, because you have time to really see.
