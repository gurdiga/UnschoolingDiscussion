I have a dilemma and am hoping I can get some good <br/>\norderly direction with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in my heart I need to ignore unsupportive people, but I have <br/>\nhad it with a neighbor. This woman lives next to us, also works in <br/>\nthe corner store near where we live, and for some strange reason is <br/>\nCONSTANTLY discussing my son&#39;s education. It got so bad that we <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go in there. My son would go into the store to purchase <br/>\nsomething and the woman purposely would charge him too much. I take <br/>\nit her thinking was because he&#39;s homeschooled that he can&#39;t count <br/>\nchange? I&#39;m not sure and can&#39;t say what&#39;s in her head, but after the <br/>\n5th time of noticing this (we thought SHE was the one who couldn&#39;t <br/>\ncount lol!) I called the store to complain about her and we never <br/>\nwent back. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was bad enough to have her always bring up his schooling when <br/>\nsimply buying a cup of coffee, but I would ignore her. She has even <br/>\nbrought it up to family members who have gone in there. It&#39;s so <br/>\nannoying to have someone, who obviously needs a life, gossip and talk <br/>\nto other neighbors behind your back about our insane method of <br/>\neducation and how I&#39;m ruining my son&#39;s life, {add your own uninformed <br/>\ncomment of choice here}etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last straw for me came the other day when she was passing my son <br/>\nand his friends on the way home and told Max that &quot;Your Grandfather <br/>\nis GOING TO MAKE YOU GO TO SCHOOL!!!&quot;. Max didn&#39;t say anything (shock <br/>\nand disbelief probably) but was fairly upset when he got home from <br/>\nplay to tell me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called her and told her that we have had enough of her gossip and <br/>\nit&#39;s none of her business how we live or choose to educate, or <br/>\nanything concerning our lives. Of course she reacted and it got <br/>\nnasty. She kept hanging up on me, I called back until I finished what <br/>\nI had to say and then hung up on her. lol! Pretty silly stuff, but <br/>\nhow upsetting to have some nut so obviously obsessed with your life <br/>\nthat they spend WAY too much time discussing your business with <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you all had anything remotely like this happen? It was <br/>\nhorrible. It&#39;s a good thing we live in a very homeschool friendly <br/>\nstate or I&#39;d be concerned she&#39;d do something like attempt to report <br/>\nus. Pretty scary stuff. I really dislike confrontation, but that was <br/>\nmy last straw. If nothing else, I just wanted her to know that I knew <br/>\nwhat she had said, that it&#39;s not acceptable, and to never speak to my <br/>\nson again. There was no reason in what she told him and it was a <br/>\ntotal lie meant to scare my son.
