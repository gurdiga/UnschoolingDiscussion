In fact, it would appear to<br/>\nbe<br/>\n  the reverse.  For starters, the vaccine has been known to cause shingles<br/>\nin<br/>\n  children.  Shingles is usually seen in folks over 50.  There have been no<br/>\n  studies done to date that would be able to tell whether or not anyone will<br/>\n  get shingles because the vaccine has not been around long enough to give<br/>\n  that data.  Further, shingles only effects a tiny percent of adults who<br/>\nhad<br/>\n  chicken pox.<br/>\n<br/>\n  According to the National Vaccine Information Center, many healthcare<br/>\n  professionals are very concerned that the live vaccine virus may<br/>\n&quot;reactivate<br/>\n  later in life in the form of herpes zoster (shingles) or other immune<br/>\nsystem<br/>\n  disorders.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, since it is a &quot;live&quot; vaccine, it will reside in the body no<br/>\ndifferently<br/>\n  than the actual virus itself.  And since it has shown itself to do what<br/>\n  chicken pox doesn&#39;t normally do (cause shingles in children), then it<br/>\nwould<br/>\n  be logical to figure that it has a much more likely outlook of causing a<br/>\n  higher percentage of cases in adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You also have to look at what has happened with the MMR vaccine.  Noteably<br/>\n  that mothers who had measles gave an immunity to their infants.  Babies<br/>\n  rarely got measles if their mothers had had measles as a child.  There is<br/>\nan<br/>\n  80% increase in measles in infants whose mothers did not get measles but<br/>\n  instead had the shots.  The odds are that the same thing will happen to<br/>\n  children of mothers who get the VERIVAX shots.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Chicken pox is a live vaccine and since children frequently get a mild<br/>\ncase,<br/>\n  immunized children are a threat to pregnant women.  Particularly as the<br/>\nmild<br/>\n  case they get is not usually evident.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, several large medical facilities either opposed the licensing of<br/>\n  VARIVAX or do not recommend it to their patients--Department of<br/>\nPediatrics,<br/>\n  St. Luke&#39;s Medical Center, California&#39;s Pacificare Health Systems HMO and<br/>\n  others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Then there is the other problem with the MMR vaccine and which they think<br/>\n  may also happen with VARIVAX.  There is now atypical measles which is only<br/>\n  seen in people who have had the MMR vaccine.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is too much that isn&#39;t known about VARIVAX.  AND, chicken pox is not<br/>\n  that big a problem and the vaccine will leave the vaccinated children<br/>\n  unprotected as adults (they don&#39;t even know how long it is good for but<br/>\nsay<br/>\n  6 to 10 years) when the death rates from chicken pox are 10 to 20 times<br/>\n  higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, since shingles occurs when a person loses their immunity to the<br/>\nvirus,<br/>\n  and it is believed that the immunity created by the shot only lasts 6 to<br/>\n10<br/>\n  years, it would appear that there is every likely hood that there could be<br/>\n  an increase in the cases of shingles.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Folks should also be advised by their doc that the vaccine contains two<br/>\n  forms of MSG.  According to the FDA, MSG is not advised for infants,<br/>\n  children, or pregnant women or children of childbearing age, and people<br/>\nwith<br/>\n  affective (mental/emotional) disorders.  Also, it contains gelatin and<br/>\ntrace<br/>\n  amounts of neomycin.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: Connie Carlton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie@...\">connie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 10:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question about the objection of shot<br/>\n  requirements(?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; You can only get shingles (Herpes Zoster) if you have HAD chicken pox.<br/>\n  Some<br/>\n  &gt; people may have had chicken pox in a very mild form and never knew they<br/>\n  had<br/>\n  &gt; it... or they had it as a child and their parents didn&#39;t remember.

For starters, the vaccine has been known to cause shingles in ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1528006029\">Your information on shingles is not correct.  In fact, it would appear to be<br/>\nthe reverse.  For starters, the vaccine has been known to cause shingles in<br/>\nchildren.  Shingles is usually seen in folks over 50.  There have been no<br/>\nstudies done to date that would be able to tell whether or not anyone will<br/>\nget shingles because the vaccine has not been around long enough to give<br/>\nthat data.  Further, shingles only effects a tiny percent of adults who had<br/>\nchicken pox.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the National Vaccine Information Center, many healthcare<br/>\nprofessionals are very concerned that the live vaccine virus may &quot;reactivate<br/>\nlater in life in the form of herpes zoster (shingles) or other immune system<br/>\ndisorders.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, since it is a &quot;live&quot; vaccine, it will reside in the body no differently<br/>\nthan the actual virus itself.  And since it has shown itself to do what<br/>\nchicken pox doesn&#39;t normally do (cause shingles in children), then it would<br/>\nbe logical to figure that it has a much more likely outlook of causing a<br/>\nhigher percentage of cases in adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also have to look at what has happened with the MMR vaccine.  Noteably<br/>\nthat mothers who had measles gave an immunity to their infants.  Babies<br/>\nrarely got measles if their mothers had had measles as a child.  There is an<br/>\n80% increase in measles in infants whose mothers did not get measles but<br/>\ninstead had the shots.  The odds are that the same thing will happen to<br/>\nchildren of mothers who get the VERIVAX shots.<br/>\n<br/>\nChicken pox is a live vaccine and since children frequently get a mild case,<br/>\nimmunized children are a threat to pregnant women.  Particularly as the mild<br/>\ncase they get is not usually evident.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, several large medical facilities either opposed the licensing of<br/>\nVARIVAX or do not recommend it to their patients--Department of Pediatrics,<br/>\nSt. Luke&#39;s Medical Center, California&#39;s Pacificare Health Systems HMO and<br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the other problem with the MMR vaccine and which they think<br/>\nmay also happen with VARIVAX.  There is now atypical measles which is only<br/>\nseen in people who have had the MMR vaccine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is too much that isn&#39;t known about VARIVAX.  AND, chicken pox is not<br/>\nthat big a problem and the vaccine will leave the vaccinated children<br/>\nunprotected as adults (they don&#39;t even know how long it is good for but say<br/>\n6 to 10 years) when the death rates from chicken pox are 10 to 20 times<br/>\nhigher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since shingles occurs when a person loses their immunity to the virus,<br/>\nand it is believed that the immunity created by the shot only lasts 6 to 10<br/>\nyears, it would appear that there is every likely hood that there could be<br/>\nan increase in the cases of shingles.<br/>\n<br/>\nFolks should also be advised by their doc that the vaccine contains two<br/>\nforms of MSG.  According to the FDA, MSG is not advised for infants,<br/>\nchildren, or pregnant women or children of childbearing age, and people with<br/>\naffective (mental/emotional) disorders.  Also, it contains gelatin and trace<br/>\namounts of neomycin.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Connie Carlton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie@...\">connie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 10:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question about the objection of shot<br/>\nrequirements(?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; You can only get shingles (Herpes Zoster) if you have HAD chicken pox.<br/>\nSome<br/>\n&gt; people may have had chicken pox in a very mild form and never knew they<br/>\nhad<br/>\n&gt; it... or they had it as a child and their parents didn&#39;t remember.

But I have a list of ingredients for all<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; major vaccines.  The vaccines are grown and strained in various tissues,<br/>\n&gt; human or animal, like monkey kidney, chicken embryos, etc.  For rubella,<br/>\n&gt; hepatitis A and chicken-pox vaccines they use human diploid cells, which<br/>\n&gt; come from the organs of aborted fetuses.

She also did not<br/>\nvaccinate her child according to the govt schedule.  <br/>\nTo vaccinate or not to vaccinate is a personal family<br/>\ndecision.

I looked it up myself and found the following from<br/>\nthe South Dakota Journal of Medicine.  Many websites misquote the actual<br/>\ntext and give the impression that fetuses are being aborted and harvested<br/>\nfor the production of this vaccine, when in fact, as the following text<br/>\ndescribes, tissue was taken from 2 embryos 40 years ago and those cells are<br/>\nreproduced in the laboratory (the cells not the embryos) and have saved<br/>\nthousands of lives as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this an important distinction.  Vaccines are not being made from the<br/>\nflesh of freshly aborted babies.  The cells captured 40 years ago could just<br/>\nas easily have come from naturally aborted fetuses or miscarriage.  It seems<br/>\nobvious that you&#39;d want to control the cell replication in the laboratory<br/>\nand not introduce new cell lines and potentially dangerous disease threads<br/>\nas a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nFallacy: Aborted fetuses are routinely used to manufacture Varivax(r).<br/>\nFacts: Human diploid fibroblast cell lines are used to produce several<br/>\ndifferent vaccines. Human diploid cells are immature cells that can be grown<br/>\nindefinitely and readily support viral growth. Currently, there are two<br/>\nhuman diploid cell lines in use, WI-38 and MRC-5. Both of these cell lines<br/>\nwere developed from lung tissue of two therapeutically aborted fetuses in<br/>\n1961 and 1966. The medical reasons for the abortions were independent<br/>\ndecisions unrelated to the production of the human diploid fibroblast cells<br/>\nor vaccines. All human diploid cells used in the past and today for vaccine<br/>\nproduction come from the WI-38 andMRC-5 cell lines.14 Dr. Takahashi and<br/>\ncolleagues developed the Oka master seed virus and from this the various<br/>\nvaricella vaccines are produced.10,15<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Saga [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mom@...\">mom@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, August 08, 2001 11:05 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] Question about the objection of shot<br/>\nrequirements(?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are right in the middle of moving right now, and can&#39;t seem to locate<br/>\nmy<br/>\n  folder of vaccine information.

As a doctor once said to me, &quot;die<br/>\nof something we can&#39;t cure.&quot;  As for chicken-pox, that&#39;s a different story.<br/>\nSome people may not ever get chicken pox.  Chicken pox isn&#39;t like the other<br/>\ndiseases in that you are never protected from it.  If you&#39;ve had chicken pox<br/>\nyou&#39;ll never get chicken pox again, but if you come in contact with someone<br/>\nwho has chicken pox you can get shingles (which from my recollection of a<br/>\ngreat-Aunt who had it, not a pleasant thing to have).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for requiring people to vaccinate their children?  I have mixed feelings<br/>\nabout it.  I certainly believe that a parent has a right to opt out of<br/>\neverything, shots, public schools, etc.  But if a parent decides to place<br/>\ntheir child in a public, tax-payer sponsored, school, then the school (and<br/>\nthe tax-payers) have a right to establish rules that everyone must conform<br/>\nto.  Either opt-out or opt-in.
