Hey!  That&#39;s really <br/>\nunschooling isn&#39;t it?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am finding the discussions about Ned&#39;s posts particularly <br/>\ninteresting.  I know Ned from some other lists I am on and have a <br/>\ncouple of comments inserted in the post below for anyone interested:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Joyce wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d bet it&#39;s a rare unschooler -- even factoring in the number <br/>\nwho heard him<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at the conference -- who&#39;s even heard of Frank Smith. I think <br/>\nthe only<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reason people here knew him was Pam Sorooshian kept recommending <br/>\nhis Book of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Learning and Forgetting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; May I ask Joyce, what is your point?<br/>\n&gt;Joyce again: <br/>\n&gt; My point is that your words are not conveying your meaning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you really mean that unschoolers (which implies at least a large<br/>\n&gt; percentage) know who Frank Smith is? That&#39;s what your words say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know the original reason Frank Smith was brought <br/>\nup, but I know of Frank Smith and I found him on my own, in the <br/>\nprocess of unschooling.  I read a book authored by him that I saw at <br/>\nthe library and remember thinking, Wow, this guy sounds a lot like <br/>\nJohn Holt in that he is a person who worked in the school system and <br/>\nsees lots of problems.  And I remember some of his ideas were very <br/>\nunschoolish in nature.  I was excited that there was someone alive <br/>\nthat might continue to write books similar to Holt&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you really mean that unschoolers spend a lot of time thinking <br/>\nabout the<br/>\n&gt; school system? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah.  I do.  I have learned so much by getting into <br/>\nunschooling and my personal interests have been very strong into <br/>\nschools and how they operate, which led into politics, which led me <br/>\nto libertarian thought, which led me to realize I needed much more <br/>\npersonal education about economic thought, etc., etc.  It&#39;s very easy <br/>\nfor me to see how this could happen with an unschooler who cares <br/>\nabout education in general.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;If they are they have been mysteriously silent about it for the 8<br/>\n&gt; years I&#39;ve been on message boards and lists. <br/>\n<br/>\nGuess you haven&#39;t been on the right lists. :)  Ah, does that imply <br/>\nthat this list isn&#39;t the right place for that kind of thought?  <br/>\nMaybe, maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unschoolers do discuss,<br/>\n&gt; what they have been discussing online for years and years is the <br/>\nspecific<br/>\n&gt; damage done to their child, their guilt at having allowed it to <br/>\nhappen and<br/>\n&gt; what they can do about it. That&#39;s what this list helps to address.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;m not being Ms. Editor who knows what you mean and am just <br/>\npicking on<br/>\n&gt; your wording to humiliate you. I couldn&#39;t even begin to discuss <br/>\nyour ideas<br/>\n&gt; because your words are getting in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed is not very tactful when it comes to discussing schools and how <br/>\nbad they are.  I like that.  It&#39;s good to hear someone tell it like <br/>\nit is.  As with a lot of people, you have to sometimes get past how <br/>\nthey like to express thoughts and then discuss it with them if you <br/>\nlike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not an invitation for you to explain your ideas. It&#39;s been <br/>\npointed<br/>\n&gt; out numerous times that this list can&#39;t accomodate the type of <br/>\npolitical<br/>\n&gt; discussion you want to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is the case and maybe not.  What I am saying is that the <br/>\narea of politics IS as much about unschooling to some people as <br/>\nlearning to make your own peanut butter sandwich or discussing the <br/>\nkissing abilities of past boyfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t get is why an unschooling list, which has such an <br/>\nextreme volume of mail anyway, can&#39;t let the readers be unschoolish <br/>\nand decide which posts they want to read and participate in while <br/>\nignoring or deleting other posts they aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand not wanting the list to look like it&#39;s turned into a <br/>\nlist for a particular subject even if that subject happens to be very <br/>\ninteresting to the the unschoolers posting.  And yet, for <br/>\nunschoolers, it&#39;s important to be able to hear the direction that <br/>\nother unschoolers&#39; lives took after they began following their own <br/>\ninterests along with their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that was fun.  Maybe I&#39;ll post here again soon.
