They still need to continue to make sense and be able to back up what<br/>\nthey&#39;re saying. *But* if someone is battering at them asking them to prove<br/>\nevery little bit because unschooling sounds so impossible to believe, then,<br/>\nto keep the list useful for others, the &quot;proven over time&quot; people have the<br/>\nprivilege of saying &quot;Look, you&#39;ll just need to accept that I know what I&#39;m<br/>\ntalking about for now and read until this starts to make sense.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":93802122,"authorName":"Tim and Maureen","from":"Tim and Maureen &lt;tmthomas@...&gt;","profile":"wisdom0007","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] How to write your opinion to this group WAS OT Same Sex marriage WAS Sharing Culture","postDate":"1056460845","msgId":75304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWMzM2E1MyQ2YzAyNmEyMCQxODU1NDUxOEBjYS5zaGF3Y2FibGUubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJCMURDMTRCLjFCMzEyJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75318,"prevInTime":75303,"nextInTime":75305,"topicId":75304,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmmm, this has been interesting and now I m hearing Joyce (whose opinion I respect a great deal), but I thot I owned my stuff.

But in talking about my beliefs, esp. about unschooling, it seems, here in Canuck-ville, I have had people slowly admit they are Christian and I find the malady is still there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m stopping on this thread - letting it go - but I would LOVE to see an FAQ on how to &quot;own&quot; your stuff - and how to acknowledge the other person owned it.  I think Sandar was trying to help me own it with the spat with Deb from IL on another thread and here I tried it again.  (Damn!

I believe that they are overpowered with the original<br/>\n  &gt; sin mythology and belive we are all flawed rather than intrinsically valuable.<br/>\n  &gt; They also completely subjugate animals as lower forms of life.  And they deny<br/>\n  &gt; what seems to me to be the obvious truth of evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Which makes it sound like all liberals are nonChristian.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Did you say you were in Canada? Are things that different in Canada?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since you make the distinction between Christian and Buddhist/Taoist I<br/>\n  assume you mean by Christianity the religion that encompases Presbyterians,<br/>\n  Lutherans, Methodists and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And yet you mention their denial of evolution. That belief is only true of<br/>\n  Bible literalists and they don&#39;t represent the majority of Christians.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In America it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that everyone we meet is Christian.<br/>\n  And yet Americans can be anywhere from conservative to liberal. So it&#39;s not<br/>\n  safe to make the broad statement you did.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *Unless* someone lives in the Bible Belt. *Unless* someone is confining<br/>\n  their assumptions about Christians to people who *tell* others they&#39;re<br/>\n  Christian.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In the US people don&#39;t go around telling people they&#39;re Christians. It&#39;s<br/>\n  just assumed. It&#39;d be like telling people they&#39;re human ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  *Unless* what they mean by Christian is fundamentalist Christian. And *then*<br/>\n  the reason they&#39;re telling you they&#39;re Christian is because they&#39;re<br/>\n  proselytizing. And proselytizing is part of the package that includes the<br/>\n  viewpoints you mentioned above. So it&#39;s likely that anyone who proselytizes<br/>\n  also holds the other beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, how do you know the judgemental people you&#39;ve met are Christian? Have<br/>\n  they told you? Are you aware of their religion because of the cirucmstances<br/>\n  you&#39;re meeting them in. Christians you meet in a demonstration outside a<br/>\n  Planned Parenthood clinic are not likely to be a broad spectrum of<br/>\n  Christians ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
