This day has special meaning to me, considering<br/>\n&gt; that I did not learn to read until I was 12, drooped out of sixth grade<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; was home schooled, only to be told the rest of my life that I would be a<br/>\n&gt; failure. I am happy to say that the infamous &quot;they&quot; (we all know them )<br/>\n&gt; were wrong about me-not only is my book out, but I recently graduated<br/>\nbrown<br/>\n&gt; university with honors in English literature.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The book itself is my small attempt to make sure other students don&#39;t go<br/>\n&gt; through the shame and struggle that I did, whether they are LD/ADHD, home<br/>\n&gt; schooled, or simply think different. The book explores my and my<br/>\nco-authors<br/>\n&gt; (an ADHD, high school drop out who also graduated from brown) journey<br/>\n&gt; through school then out lines alternative learning skills we developed to<br/>\n&gt; beat all the odds.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My royalties for Learning outside the lines also go to my other attempt to<br/>\n&gt; help kids who think different, Project eye to eye-a national acclaimed<br/>\n&gt; mentoring program for LD/ADHD children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The book is out all over the place now (a scary things for a kid who could<br/>\n&gt; never even read teachers comments on his papers) and I would love to hear<br/>\n&gt; what you think. The easiest  place to check it out on line is at this<br/>\nlink:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068486598X/qid%3D968205875/104-747208\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068486598X/qid%3D968205875/104-747208</a><br/>\n&gt; 6-8330358<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But most importantly I wanted to thank you for your commitment to<br/>\n&gt; alternative learning and cognitive diversity.
