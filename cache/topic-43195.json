You make <br/>\na little flat person (or flat animal, or whatever...).  You find <br/>\nsomeone in the database of over 200 people who you would like to send <br/>\nyour flat traveler to visit.  They take him around, showing him the <br/>\nsites where they live, and keep a journal of what he does for a <br/>\nweek.  Sometimes they send pictures or postcards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is keeping a journal of all the places her flat travelers <br/>\nvisit.  Flat Tiger just came home from Florida, She just sent a flat <br/>\ntraveler to Hawaii, and another is on its way home from Puerto Rico. <br/>\nShe is 9 and really into it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 5 and sent one out, but really isn&#39;t into it like his <br/>\nsister.  He said he doesn&#39;t care if he doesn&#39;t send anymore out. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re taking a party of 8 flat travelers with us when we go to take a <br/>\nride on Thomas the Tank Engine in a few weeks!
