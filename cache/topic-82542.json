He did quit and has been happy he <br/>\nleft.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight I was shopping and ran into a Mom who had a child on the team. Her <br/>\nson also quit which is something they didn&#39;t allow their older son to do two <br/>\nyears ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make to story short she told me that the coach was asked to leave due to <br/>\nhis cursing at the kids!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to say thank you to all who commented on my posts it was good <br/>\nto know others where thinking as I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been holding the gear until the end of the season and had planned on <br/>\nrequesting our funds back.
