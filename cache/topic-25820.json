You <br/>\nall gave me excellent ideas and my mind is just ticking away with things we <br/>\ncan do now. Also, I MUCH appreciate those of you who shared that you didnt <br/>\njust smoothly unschool right out of the box but that, it appears, it is a <br/>\ngrowth process not only for the kids but for us as well.  And I think the <br/>\nbiggest thing I gleaned from you all is to RELAX! <br/>\nWith lots of thanks and feeling more encouraged,<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25819,"nextTopicId":25816}}
