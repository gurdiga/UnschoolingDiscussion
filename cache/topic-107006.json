The last time he was at <br/>\nthe shop the same time I was, he said, &quot;You never have told me why <br/>\nyou quit teaching.&quot;  I was quiet for a long time, many things going <br/>\nthrough my head, a roll-a-dex if you will, same as another poster <br/>\nmentioned her brain doing, and I finally told him, &quot;You know, after <br/>\nanswering that question numerous times in the past 2 years, I&#39;ve <br/>\ndiscovered that some people are not going to be happy with my answer <br/>\nand still think I&#39;m crazy.  Are you one of those?&quot;  A customer <br/>\noverheard and asked what I used to do.  I told him.  He said, bet you <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make enough money.  I said that I was making as much working <br/>\nat the gas station with a chance to make more, than what I was making <br/>\nat my last teaching job (minus the health insurance pmt.).  Ted <br/>\nlooked at me and said, &quot;That would have been a very reasonable answer <br/>\nto me&quot; with a little grin on his face.  We had a great conversation <br/>\nafter that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd about the spelling... I just wanted to mention that my 12yo dd <br/>\nand I have gotten HOOKED  on the GSN station and the game LINGO.  We <br/>\nget very involved yelling at the contestants and everything.  The <br/>\nother day I stomped off into the kitchen because a contestant tried <br/>\nto use the word &quot;trods&quot; and was told it was not in the dictionary!  I <br/>\nabout lost it.  I even threw something at the screen!  I was still <br/>\neavesdropping though and overheard them accept &quot;poser&quot; and began <br/>\nwondering what dictionary they were looking in.  Anyway, the 12yo <br/>\nsits and guesses right along with me, although she doesn&#39;t throw <br/>\nthings at the t.v. when she disagrees &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":106997,"nextTopicId":106859}}
