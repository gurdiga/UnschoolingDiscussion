For years, I worked nights (10p to 6a, or 11p to <br/>\n7a) as a nurse. I always worked nights because, one I was up anyway, and two, <br/>\nwhen Moly was a baby it saved us daycare costs. Aside from that, ever since I <br/>\ncan remember I have had a hard time falling asleep, and will wake up if I <br/>\nmanage to go to sleep before 2am. I&#39;ve tried all sorts of things. I have at <br/>\ndesperate times, stayed awake for two or three days just so I could try to get my <br/>\nbody on a more natural pattern with the rest of the world. Still on that third <br/>\nor fourth night, exhausted, I will wake up in the middle of the night anyway. <br/>\nI&#39;ve even tried going to a sleep disorder clinic, I&#39;ve taken medication, tried <br/>\nbiofeedback, music, sleeping in different places, cutting caffeine out of my <br/>\ndiet, the list is never ending. Regardless, if your son can stand to sleep <br/>\nduring nontraditional sleep hours, and you don&#39;t mind either, then why not let his <br/>\nbody get the sleep it needs then. I understand the disruption, you have to or <br/>\nwant to go somewhere, he is just falling asleep. His pacing the house at all <br/>\nhours trying to get to sleep isn&#39;t healthy either. It puts unnecessary stress <br/>\non him due to the worry. If you don&#39;t mind doing things with him later in the <br/>\nday/afternoon and letting him stay at home on the days you have things to do <br/>\noutside of the house, the give it a shot. Let him develop his own natural sleep <br/>\npatterns. As a teen and adult, he can get jobs working later, he can go to <br/>\ncollege (if that is what he wants) during nontraditional hours too. Most offer <br/>\nevening classes. His world will not come to an end if he is a day sleeper. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nHe will have to adjust to the majority of the world working on that typical 9 <br/>\nto 5 ;o) but he can, like many do, manage a full life. It is my opinion that <br/>\nit is more unhealthy to force himself to be like the rest of the world, getting <br/>\nless/no sleep, than it would be for him to just give into what his body is <br/>\ntrying to tell him. Some people are just night people. If he really has true <br/>\ninsomnia, (that is me, if I get two hours, I&#39;m doing good) and can&#39;t sleep at <br/>\nall, no matter what time of day/night it is, then I highly recommend a sleep <br/>\nclinic. Although it didn&#39;t help me, much, I did learn some things about my sleep <br/>\nneeds, and that has gone a long way toward a more healthy life. My own opinion <br/>\nabout medication is that, although there are a few that have actually given me <br/>\nsleep, they also make me suffer from more troubling nightmares and when I do <br/>\nwake up, I am groggy, loopy, headachy, and that lasts for hours. On top of all <br/>\nthat, medication has only ever given me an additional two or three hours of <br/>\n(restless) sleep. To me, that is not worth the trade off. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\nHe felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered <br/>\nwhose it was and whether they were enjoying it.<br/>\nDouglas Adams <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85110659,"authorName":"Kimberly Fry","from":"Kimberly Fry &lt;kimberly_fry@...&gt;","profile":"kimberly_fry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] getting to sleep","postDate":"1064935150","msgId":81802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTMwMTUxOTEwLjI5NTMzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNDA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyMzUwMWMzODc1OCQ5YTNiYWRhMCQwMzAwYThjMEBUaW5rZXJiZWxsPg=="},"prevInTopic":81797,"nextInTopic":81805,"prevInTime":81801,"nextInTime":81803,"topicId":81797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son kinda goes through stages where he ll have difficulty falling asleep.
