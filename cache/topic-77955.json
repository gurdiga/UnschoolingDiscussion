Parents feel isolated<br/>\n&gt; often, if all their friends and family are school/school-at-homers. Many<br/>\n&gt; families find it difficult to carve out time/money issues.

Parents feel isolated <br/>\noften, if all their friends and family are school/school-at-homers. Many <br/>\nfamilies find it difficult to carve out time/money issues.

They don&#39;t know you <br/>\nhave to drop whatever you&#39;re doing, no matter how interesting, every 50 <br/>\nminutes, or keep doing something, no matter how dull, for 50 minutes. <br/>\nThey&#39;ll never understand that you can&#39;t get away from unpleasant, even <br/>\ndangerous, people and that you have no power over where you go when or <br/>\nwho you associate with.

When my 6 year old recently came back from a week long trip to the beach with his cousin, Aunt and Uncle I wished I could put him in a decompression chamber that would release him from all the negative influences he had experienced.   His cousin spends a lot of time in school, after school programs, camp and then doing parent created home work (even on vacation I found out).  They don&#39;t read to him (he is 6 as well); they have him read to them every night.  The uncle teased my son, after my son had been making friends with some girls and playing with them for a few hours, saying &quot;Gillen has a girl friend&quot;...  Now Gillen thinks he is not cool if he plays with girls (I know this is probably temporary).  He also learns a lot of school -like<br/>\n competitive stuff when he plays with school kids (some of them).  It takes him days or weeks to leave this stuff behind.  I am probably oversensitive to it, but this issue is the hard part to me.  I don&#39;t want to shelter my children.  I want to provide a model of staying true to myself so they will be true to themselves as well.   And I don&#39;t want them to feel that it is &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;.  But lately, I often feel that way.  When I am feeling judgemental I want to be able to inflence these people I&#39;m judging by my parenting rather than trying to recruit them, verbally,  to my way of thinking!  I guess this is all about unschooling in a society that has so many completely other end of the spectrum beliefs about education.<br/>\n <br/>\nMadeline<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mam2474@...\">Mam2474@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes unschooling have its own problems?

Before I begin, I thought it would be best to introduce <br/>\nmyself.  My name is Stephanie and I have two daughters, ages 3 and 6, <br/>\nwho have never been to school.  I have been lurking here for about a <br/>\nyear, and haven&#39;t ever really mustered up the nerve to post.

So a quick &quot;thank you&quot; to all who contribute:  <br/>\nThank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the other bit.  I have been arguing with people I don&#39;t know <br/>\nabout homeschooling, unschooling, and schooling today.  This is <br/>\nannoying in itself, but while I was mulling it over, this thought <br/>\ncame to me:  I think it is telling that whenever people argue with me <br/>\nabout school vs. home/unschooling, they always say, &quot;I will readily <br/>\nadmit that school has it&#39;s problems, but nothing is perfect.&quot;  Yet, I <br/>\nhave never felt the need to make a similar statement about <br/>\nunschooling (school-at-home maybe, but not unschooling).  And <br/>\nfurther, I don&#39;t think that many other unschoolers would feel the <br/>\nneed to either.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I thought that maybe that wasn&#39;t entirely true.  Maybe other <br/>\nunschoolers do find that unschooling has its problems, maybe even <br/>\nones I would agree with.  So, I decided to ask you all.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes unschooling have its own problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, <br/>\nbut I do think it &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, while school does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there we go.  My first real post.
