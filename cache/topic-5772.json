I have a friend whose father insisted they learn a trade first,<br/>\nso she went to beauty school.  Later, she earned a degree in psychology. <br/>\nNow she is staying at home with her three year old daughter and cutting<br/>\nhair, doing perms, etc. in her home while her daughter is there with her.<br/>\n I have her cut my hair.  It is so much easier to get a haircut when I<br/>\ncan bring my kids along and not have to worry about them being in the<br/>\nway.  Plus, she gets to keep all the money - doesn&#39;t have to share it<br/>\nwith a shop.<br/>\nSo here is my fantasy:  I&#39;m an expert in auto mechanics and I do tune-ups<br/>\n& oil changes in people&#39;s own garage.
