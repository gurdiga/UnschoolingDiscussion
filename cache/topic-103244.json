You are probably all nodding your heads and rolling your eyes. I have to <br/>\nprocess everything OUT LOUD. But thanks for your indulgence anyway. I&#39;m hoping my little <br/>\nexclamations help someone else less extroverted to feel sane.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is 17. This year he is totally at home with no expectations on him from us. I think we <br/>\nreally have always been gently nudging him (even when I didn&#39;t think I was...). He is more <br/>\nsusceptible to &quot;nudges&quot; than I realized. He struggles to balance my &quot;good ideas&quot; against <br/>\nwhat he really wants to do and it undermines him. I took acceptance of my ideas as <br/>\npersonal interest on his part and am just noticing now that that was not the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been worried about stuff like organization, a sense of direction, an ability to see his <br/>\nfuture, etc. I also worried that he was not engaged in enough activity that looked like he <br/>\nwas learning...  (I know, I know)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, in the last two months, it&#39;s like he has blossomed in spite of me. Now that he&#39;s been <br/>\ntotally out of school, decided not to play lacrosse (even after I put subtle ::cringe:: <br/>\npressure on him to play again... I&#39;m such an idiot), and there is no expectation that he&#39;ll go <br/>\nto college next year, he is doing the coolest things!<br/>\n<br/>\n1. He got cast in the lead in our city&#39;s professionally directed high school Shakespeare <br/>\ncompany. He is loving this! The training is fabulous and he&#39;s totally dialed in to rehearsing, <br/>\nstudying lines, learning all about Shakespeare poetry etc. We are astounded at how much <br/>\nShakespeare he has memorized for fun that we didn&#39;t even know about.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. He auditioned for a band and got the part of lead guitar. I didn&#39;t even know he knew a <br/>\nband and I never see him practice. He told me he practices in the middle of the night with <br/>\nthe amp unplugged. He&#39;s gotten good! He also plays piano, though he plays Rachmaninov <br/>\ninstead of heavy metal...<br/>\n<br/>\n3. He&#39;s reading again. He went through a period of not reading much (I realize now that <br/>\nfor him, his obligations to &quot;school&quot; - just one class per day - and sports depleted him of <br/>\nthat energy). Last night he walked around with Plato&#39;s Republic... I have no idea why. :) <br/>\nHe&#39;s got a stack of books out including Hithchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n4. He&#39;s working at a job he LOVES for the first time (Starbucks at B&N).<br/>\n<br/>\n5. He suddenly has a social life and lots of friends (this was a big concern of ours).<br/>\n<br/>\n6. He&#39;s driving our third car and taking such good care of it. He calls me about cheap gas <br/>\nwhenever he finds it, and hasn&#39;t had to be asked to check the oil (after just about ruining <br/>\nhis car over the same problem).<br/>\n<br/>\n7. He bought milk for us this a.m. because we were out without asking for money or if I <br/>\nwould get it. :) He is managing his money beautifully for the first time-has real goals and <br/>\nis keeping to them without any support from Jon or me.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. He is learning to be a Magic level one judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on. This is like a complete turn around in his life since January. Some of <br/>\nthese things were sort of in place in the fall, but it&#39;s like his life is suddenly really rich *for <br/>\nhim* and I have virtually nothing to do with it except to chat and hug and laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s getting along great with all of us (parents, kids) and none of the signs of mild <br/>\ndepression I thought I saw there before.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I just squeal for a minute?! Eeeeeee.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, I am happy that I got out of the way. Thanks for all the good ideas and support <br/>\naround here.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103171,"nextTopicId":103242}}
