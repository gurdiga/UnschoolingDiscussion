Still, it was <br/>\nfun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying the kids should have to go to bed at 6:30, but maybe move into <br/>\nanother part of the house, engage in quieter play or be read to or watch a <br/>\nvideo after that time, to allow Grandma a portion every day of the quiet she&#39;s <br/>\nused to.  Maybe an outing for ice cream or to see Christmas lights in the <br/>\nevening, while Grandma stays home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t stay with my mother because she seems worn out by all of us too <br/>\nquickly.

But...I don&#39;t tell her when to go to bed. I want her to know when she&#39;s getting tired so we have a &#39;quiet time&#39; in her room before bed. It&#39;s explained to her as a chance to have some private time and go play or look at books by herself. She help determine when it will be and we&#39;re fairly flexible but it&#39;s usuallly between 7 and 8. It&#39;s usually about 20 or 30 mins (sometimes an hour but we don&#39;t sweat it) before we&#39;re called in for a bedtime story and to tuck her in.

She&#39;s very much one of those &quot;children go to bed at 6:30 pm like it or not&quot; types. (I think I have the &quot;children need to eat only at mealtimes, and clean their plates deal settled..we&#39;ll bring our own food for them) Last time I stayed with her overnight, I had to lay down with Sarah for quite awhile before she&#39;d relax enough to go to sleep. The stress of it all (my mother&#39;s domineering authoritarian style) was really hard on her. Now though she&#39;s old enough to take some books and read quietly...I&#39;m just worried about how Logan and Megan will react to it, and how to make it easier on them.<br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
