It is an edge I&#39;ve seen erupt too many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny this was mentioned because I just told DH last night as we sat <br/>\nfreezing at the ski lodge that I thought for now snowboarding is the best thing <br/>\nfor our 16yro, he absolutely loves it and is teaching it this year. My 12yro <br/>\ndoes not seem to need to go as often but I think the older one would go everyday <br/>\nif I could take him. As it is I am making about 4 trips a week. I really <br/>\nthink he NEEDS to burn this energy or it drives him crazy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another one of those things I took the limit off of, I used to think <br/>\nthe drive too long to make more than once or at the most twice a week (40 <br/>\nminutes each way) Now we just pick up and go even for just a few hours. (I prefer <br/>\njust a few hours) He has told me how much he is improving going several times <br/>\na week and I remembered talking to parents back when the kids were little and <br/>\nwe lived at the local pool. They could not figure out why their kids did not <br/>\nlearn to swim well. I mentioned to them that coming to the pool more often <br/>\nmight help. They would come for &quot;lessons&quot; and leave, like the lessons alone were <br/>\nthe answer.

I realized a while ago that even if I disagreed with his take on <br/>\nmy relationship with his siblings it was still how he perceived it. His <br/>\nfeeling was that I gave more attention to the 12yro, I feel I do my best to give to <br/>\nboth and to give what each one needs so it may not look the same.

It never occurred to me before that what I had been <br/>\ndoing was telling him he shouldn&#39;t feel that way, I hate when people do that to <br/>\nme. If it&#39;s the way I feel. it&#39;s the way I feel. Just by treating his feelings <br/>\nwith compassion I learned so much and we have grown even closer. I don&#39;t think <br/>\nit&#39;s something we mean to do we just get stuck. Now I am trying to look at any <br/>\nbehavior in our lives where we just keep doing the same thing over and over <br/>\nyet not getting good results.

Just so you know, play fighting <br/>\non our end tends to be throwing them onto the couches or bed, which <br/>\nthey love.  We don&#39;t come out pretending to punch or wrestle.  Ben, <br/>\non the other hand, will taunt any of us by calling us the craziest <br/>\nwierdest names...anything...to get us to fight him.  When we endulge <br/>\nhim, we give him the upper hand. At least I do, I&#39;ll have to pay <br/>\nattention more to my husband.  Unlike some of you, I grew up in a <br/>\nhouse where we play fought and it was fun. So, go figure.  It&#39;s like <br/>\ntickling.  A good friend of mine will not tickle her kids.  She was <br/>\ntickled til almost torture by a weird uncle. We tickle our kids like <br/>\ncrazy, they love it, they call it &quot;tickle fun&quot;. But when they say <br/>\nstop , we do. My friend&#39;s kids love it when I or Robert tickle them, <br/>\nbecause they never get their mom (and as a result their dad) to do <br/>\nit.  Of course, we make sure it&#39;s okay with them (parents)... they <br/>\ndon&#39;t care. We are also a very kissy/huggy family. We kiss/hug our <br/>\nkids like crazy. Well, except for our 14 year old. He&#39;s not into it <br/>\nanymore. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ixnay on the fighing...I got ya!:-)<br/>\nRachel</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155711522,"authorName":"cheryledstrom","from":"&quot;cheryledstrom&quot; &lt;momonly@...&gt;","profile":"cheryledstrom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Subject: spectrum kids, rage, unschooling","postDate":"1074484330","msgId":89347,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1Zms5YSt2MGloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":89356,"prevInTime":89346,"nextInTime":89348,"topicId":89347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a newbie at this, so i hope I do it right!

I have to agree with <br/>\nthe other response to Rachel about her child&#39;s problem with rage.  <br/>\nANY child can have a problem distinguishing play from reality, not <br/>\njust &quot;special&quot; kids.  If you are concerned about violent behavior, I <br/>\nthink it would be wise not to instigate &quot;play&quot; fighting.  To a young <br/>\nchild, fighting is fighting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think most of us have experienced the cartoon phenomena.  When our <br/>\nkids watch violent cartoons, they just naturally display more violent <br/>\nbehavior.  I think that would be multiplied exponentially when it&#39;s <br/>\nthe parent who      s the violent behavior.  As      s, we have <br/>\nlearned to distinguish the difference between what&#39;s real and what&#39;s <br/>\npretend.  A seven year old (again, ANY seven year old), really <br/>\nhasn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust try keeping his environment as calm and nurturing as possible.  <br/>\nEventually, by example, he will learn what behavior is acceptable and <br/>\nwhat is not.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89417,"nextTopicId":89437}}
