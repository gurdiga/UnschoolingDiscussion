The NCUnschoolers put it together. They&#39;ve worked out a deal at a local Rec center to have homeschoolers come and just hang out. They have a basketball court, coin operated games, park, empty rooms, and a chess-playing dad (who is willing to take on any challenger! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not *exactly* free---it&#39;s $10/family/year. &lt;g&gt; But everyone is free to do whatever he wants. One of the moms brought her worm bin to show (I came home with a cup full of worms to start my own indoor compost bin.)last Friday. Lots of folks bring knitting and games---and, of course, snacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nFREE to do what you want---and a bunch of other unschoolers to do it with. All homeschoolers are invited, but mostly unschoolers show up &#39;cause we&#39;re not busy with curricula! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s a nice day!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103575,"nextTopicId":103436}}
