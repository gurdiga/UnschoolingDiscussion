She calls me a pit back, btw.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt all depends on the family.  Different people respond differently and some people are hurt by nicknames with a bit of a pinch to them.  Other kids just don&#39;t feel bad about them.  They are names,  and the kids feel loved and cared for and they know the names are just funny ways of dealing with different issues or feelings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI call my daughter a pain in the tushe, pick her up, hug her, tickle her and she hugs me and laughs and cuddles.  I usually call her pit when she is driving me nice batty... not misbehaving, or doing something that would hurt her or someone else, but when she has drawn over herself, or put ketchup on the dog, or decides after I sat down again that yes she does want to eat what her sister is eating, or whatever.  <br/>\nThen she giggles and I take care of whatever mess is made or needs to be undone, or get her the food or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some children hate being called even terms of endearment.  One child I know only wanted to be called by the given name.  Period. Endearments come easy to me, and it was difficult not to call this child love, or sweetie, or some of the other names I gave.   Oddly, such names as creepy deep were less unappreciated....<br/>\n<br/>\nbe well,<br/>\nRachel Ann<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46073,"nextTopicId":45982}}
