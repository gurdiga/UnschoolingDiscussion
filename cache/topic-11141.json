I lost<br/>\ncontrol and went completely off the diet and couldn&#39;t<br/>\nget myself back on. It was actually my problem not the<br/>\ndiet&#39;s. I still haven&#39;t gotten back on the diet but I<br/>\nam pg now and it wouldn&#39;t be wise although I do try to<br/>\neat the equal amounts of carbs and protein but don&#39;t<br/>\npush  myself to do so. If I am hungery I eat what I<br/>\nhave i.e. want. All this talk about it is giving me<br/>\nmotivation to start the diet again after I have the<br/>\nbaby though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the other thing I forgot to mention that<br/>\nhappened when I was on this is that I did not lose any<br/>\nlbs. I started the diet weighing 170 and when I lost<br/>\nthe 5 inches from my waist I was still 170. Nearly a<br/>\nyear later I had kept the inches off and was still<br/>\n170. My fat % went down. I was confussed because I had<br/>\nnot exercised while on the diet but the only<br/>\nexplanation is that I gained muscle. That&#39;s what I<br/>\nthink is amazing. Now, when I started the diet my lean<br/>\nbody weight was 96 lb. When I went off the diet it was<br/>\naround 110 lb.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorallyn<br/>\n<br/>\n--- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HPaulson5@...\">HPaulson5@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Corallyn, this book you describe sounds like a good<br/>\n&gt; one.
