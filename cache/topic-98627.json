My kids are hooked on raisins and bananas <br/>\n(the fastest food around for babies and toddlers!) Grapes are quick, <br/>\ntoo, but I can&#39;t keep a toddler from grabbing a handful despite my <br/>\nbest efforts to make them &quot;baby-safe.&quot;  I figure if they&#39;re big <br/>\nenough to toddle over and grab fruit from a vine, they can probably <br/>\nhandle it and there&#39;s never been a problem.  Who can resist a bunch <br/>\nof fresh, delicious grapes?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, PB&J on the halfshell LOL -- this is easy for the kids; grab one <br/>\nslice of bread, spread half with P.B. (this side first &#39;cuz it stays <br/>\nin place and the jelly is messier) and half with jam (spreads easier <br/>\nthan jelly), then fold and eat!  I do it this way, buffet style, <br/>\nwhen I have eight hungry kids standing in line for a snack.  Cuts <br/>\nthe wait time in half and I get to eat, too! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also quickslice pears, nectarines (they hate peach fuzz), and <br/>\napples _around_ the core, then quarter.  If I need something more <br/>\nsubstantial in a hurry, I put out the crackers and P.B. (the natural <br/>\nkind even tastes better on apples than the sugar-filled stuff, <br/>\nthough we like both.)  I&#39;m planning to try out the apple <br/>\ncorer/peeler/slicer from Pampered Chef(.com) sometime soon.  We&#39;re <br/>\nusing their starter program for homeschool economics this year.  The <br/>\nkids already love to cook, and I figured they&#39;d have fun learning <br/>\nhow to run their own business and put on a show.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone else familiar with this company?  My DIL got involved with <br/>\nthem this summer and the more I read about their company history and <br/>\nfounder, the more impressed I was with the original idea (though <br/>\nlike any direct sales, the concept and the customers can be <br/>\nabused.)  If we end up enjoying the program, I&#39;m thinking my <br/>\ndaughter can use it to meet friends and make a little money while <br/>\nshe&#39;s away at art school.  She found an atelier in Toronto (far cry <br/>\nfrom Florida!) at the Art Renewal Center &lt; www.artrenewal.org &gt; and <br/>\nis very excited about pursuing her love of fine art!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt never fails, one thing leads to another and I end up modifying <br/>\nthe subject line! :o) HAND-PDA<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;catherine aceto&quot; <br/>\n&lt;aceto3@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once it becomes a habit, it doesn&#39;t seem like very much work.
