How do others handle these kinds of issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Slowly stop buying the products that you don&#39;t approve of (or suddenly<br/>\nstop buying them!).  We have, over the past 6 years, become very<br/>\nconscious in what foods we put in our mouths.  In the store and at home,<br/>\nI talk to my kids about what different foods do to our bodies.<br/>\nDifferent foods make us feel differently.  I should stress the *us* in<br/>\nthat sentence, because some people seem to be able to eat anything and<br/>\neverything to no ill effect (lucky bums!).  Anyway, sugar makes us need<br/>\nto use the restroom more frequently.  Lack of protein makes us starving<br/>\nlunatics.  Lack of fiber makes us constipated.  I could go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest (only 6) knows that it is good to eat when you are hungry, but<br/>\nto not eat when you aren&#39;t hungry.  She has understood this her whole<br/>\nlife.  I breastfed her on demand as a baby and she feeds herself on<br/>\ndemand now.  She understands her bodies cues.  If only we all did!  (I&#39;m<br/>\nstill relearning my own body cues.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unhealthy ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils, etc.), if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t buy it, they can&#39;t eat vast quantities of it (while they are<br/>\nlittle).  We buy lots of snack foods in this household, but my 6 yo<br/>\nwould rather have a piece of fruit.  The inevitable goldfish cracker (or<br/>\nwhatever) will show up around other people (Grandparents, Girl Scouts,<br/>\netc.) and I don&#39;t forbid it and I usually have a few myself, but we have<br/>\ndiscussed it and consider those foods to be foods that are only eaten<br/>\nonce in a while (and not every day).  I &quot;forced&quot; my infants/toddlers to<br/>\nhave a vegetarian diet, but as soon as my 6 yo started asking about<br/>\nfoods that other people were eating, we allowed her to make that choice<br/>\nherself (at first she thought that it was a joke that people ate meat,<br/>\nshe just couldn&#39;t fathom someone wanting to eat a chicken).  She has<br/>\nchosen vegetarianism on her own and should she change her mind I will<br/>\nvoice my opinions, but it is her life ultimately.  (And I won&#39;t shame<br/>\nher, afterall I ate all meats until just before she was born)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is our responsibility as parents to let our children know how we feel<br/>\nabout various issues, whether that be food, religion, schooling, or<br/>\nwhatever.  We cannot force our children to have the same views, but they<br/>\nshould be aware of why we are living the way we are (they have a right<br/>\nto know what makes us tick!).  I don&#39;t lecture my kids, but they see me<br/>\nlooking at bags in the grocery store and ask what it is that I am<br/>\nlooking for and I tell them and they help find the alternatives that are<br/>\nthe healthiest for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that my children are at a huge food advantage over myself.  I<br/>\ntruly had no idea what a healthy diet looked like as a child and most<br/>\nchildren nowadays still don&#39;t.  It is a shame since that information is<br/>\nso readily available.  Funny story:  kids and adults were talking about<br/>\nDing-Dongs and Ho-Hos and Twinkies in front of my daughter.  She asked<br/>\nwhat they were and we told her, she thought that it might be fun to try<br/>\nthem sometime.  So, next time we saw them in the store, we bought some.<br/>\nShe tried a bit of each and about gagged.  She thought the Twinkie<br/>\ntasted like air and the Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong tasted like plastic.  She<br/>\nwonders why anyone would want to eat things with virtually no flavor and<br/>\nshe immediately stopped eating them.

I agree that this is a tough age<br/>\ngap because their interests are so different, and reading out loud is<br/>\nespecially difficult because of varying interests and attention spans.<br/>\nHowever, mine have become very good friends -- the older guy is a<br/>\nresponsible older brother, the younger one prefers his company to anyone<br/>\nelse&#39;s, and they love to play games together (video, cards, imaginary,<br/>\nchasing, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to feel like you don&#39;t have time for what everyone needs.<br/>\nThat includes kids, husband and coworkers. To say nothing of oneself --<br/>\nanother topic altogether. I  have had to make what once seemed like major<br/>\ncompromises. When I worked at night, I used to read stories at breakfast<br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t home at bedtime. Today, by the time work and dinner were<br/>\nover, it was dark, but the guys wanted to go to the park so we went, in the<br/>\ndark. (It was fun -- we had it to ourselves.) Their dad is home with them<br/>\nduring the day, but of course since I&#39;ve been gone all day, there&#39;s a<br/>\nthundering race to the front door when they hear my key in the lock and then<br/>\na wrestling match to see who can hug me first (the upside of a job outside<br/>\nthe house!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you should feel bad about giving one less attention if the<br/>\nother needs more for the moment. It balances out over time. The reality is<br/>\nthat people have to satisfy their own needs sometimes and often must wait<br/>\nfor what they need. The family is an organic unit and parts  must always<br/>\naccommodate each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the younger child makes up for less parental attention with all that<br/>\nsibling attention. They learn a lot from their older siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur younger child has definitely gotten less of the concentrated attention<br/>\nthan his older sibling did. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s worse off for it. He&#39;s learned<br/>\nto find things to do on his own and he&#39;s much more self-sufficient and<br/>\neasy-going than our older one, who always seemed to need someone to help him<br/>\nfigure out how to keep busy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 11<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 11 Sep 2002 06:11:11 +0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: food choices<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to add something about the whole food issue. Just in case anyone<br/>\nis wondering about the choices their children are making.<br/>\n<br/>\nTara, my oldest was a great eater as a baby. She ate everything put in front<br/>\nof her, veggies and whatever it was. When she turned 2, it was like a<br/>\ndifferent child. Within a week, she cut out all meat to only meatballs.<br/>\nWithin the next month after that, she cut out just about everything else she<br/>\nate. She cut out milk, meat of any kind, veggies except for corn, fruit<br/>\nexcept for baby peaches. (I mean baby food) She started to survive on french<br/>\nfries, spaghettio&#39;s without the meatballs, pasta with sauce and no meat in<br/>\nthe sauce. Lunches were a chore as she was going to school. From the 2nd<br/>\ngrade up to last year, (she&#39;s almost 17)she took peanut butter and jelly to<br/>\nschool every day of her life. When she was young, I thought it was phase.<br/>\nWhn I realized it was going to be a very long one, I let her go. What was I<br/>\ngoing to do, force food into her?? I would feed her before going anywhere<br/>\nelse to eat like someone&#39;s house and even would send her with food if she<br/>\nwent visiting. Very gradually she started to add some things on her own. She<br/>\nstarted with chicken tenders from BK and went from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow she can eat out at any restuarant and manages quite well. She added some<br/>\nveggies and fruit along the way. She doesn&#39;t &quot;pig out&quot; on snacks, drinks<br/>\nonly water and ice tea, and has even gone as far as to eat steak now. The<br/>\nonly other meat from chicken she&#39;ll touch. Doesn&#39;t eat any kind of seafood<br/>\nat all. Point is it all worked for her. Even though she&#39;s a school kid,<br/>\nshe&#39;s healthier than most I know. Most of the time, the whole house can<br/>\ncatch a cold and she gets nothing. So it certainly hasn&#39;t hurt her any and<br/>\nwe&#39;ve saved countless hours of fighting over nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 12<br/>\n   Date: Wed, 11 Sep 2002 06:16:51 +0000<br/>\n   From: &quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummyone24@...\">mummyone24@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: Swear words & kids<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: MO Milligans &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Ozarkren@...\">Ozarkren@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Gosh, that&#39;s how I feel about it too :) How do you (the universal you) feel<br/>\n&gt;about your kids using it (or other such words for that matter)?

I am just now at 34 figuring out my body signs.<br/>\nBecause my upbringing was like yours, the dessert was for good behavior or<br/>\neating everything.  And I feel like I&#39;ve been on a diet my whole like(which<br/>\nis a whole &#39;nother post).  But I think its because I was never allowed to<br/>\neat on queu with my own hunger.  Had to fit into my mothers schedule.  I am<br/>\nalso going to stop buying certain things, my problem is when dh goes<br/>\nshopping.  He likes a &#39;good&#39; deal, so when he finds the cheap sugared<br/>\ncereals on sale, he goes crazy.  And my kids and he will eat it for<br/>\nbreakfast and  1 hour later they are starving maniacs, so they eat some<br/>\nwhite bread or something else sugary(sp).  Duhhhh,  I have to try and help<br/>\nthem see how this kind-of eating makes us feel.  I would easily be a veg. if<br/>\nI could only have a good enough arsenal of recipes to fix for my fam.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli, who also tends to ramble on.<br/>\n &quot;Lisa M. C.

How do others handle these kinds of issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Slowly stop buying the products that you don&#39;t approve of (or suddenly<br/>\nstop buying them!).  We have, over the past 6 years, become very<br/>\nconscious in what foods we put in our mouths.  In the store and at home,<br/>\nI talk to my kids about what different foods do to our bodies.<br/>\nDifferent foods make us feel differently.  I should stress the *us* in<br/>\nthat sentence, because some people seem to be able to eat anything and<br/>\neverything to no ill effect (lucky bums!).  Anyway, sugar makes us need<br/>\nto use the restroom more frequently.  Lack of protein makes us starving<br/>\nlunatics.  Lack of fiber makes us constipated.  I could go on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest (only 6) knows that it is good to eat when you are hungry, but<br/>\nto not eat when you aren&#39;t hungry.  She has understood this her whole<br/>\nlife.  I breastfed her on demand as a baby and she feeds herself on<br/>\ndemand now.  She understands her bodies cues.  If only we all did!  (I&#39;m<br/>\nstill relearning my own body cues.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unhealthy ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils, etc.), if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t buy it, they can&#39;t eat vast quantities of it (while they are<br/>\nlittle).  We buy lots of snack foods in this household, but my 6 yo<br/>\nwould rather have a piece of fruit.  The inevitable goldfish cracker (or<br/>\nwhatever) will show up around other people (Grandparents, Girl Scouts,<br/>\netc.) and I don&#39;t forbid it and I usually have a few myself, but we have<br/>\ndiscussed it and consider those foods to be foods that are only eaten<br/>\nonce in a while (and not every day).  I &quot;forced&quot; my infants/toddlers to<br/>\nhave a vegetarian diet, but as soon as my 6 yo started asking about<br/>\nfoods that other people were eating, we allowed her to make that choice<br/>\nherself (at first she thought that it was a joke that people ate meat,<br/>\nshe just couldn&#39;t fathom someone wanting to eat a chicken).  She has<br/>\nchosen vegetarianism on her own and should she change her mind I will<br/>\nvoice my opinions, but it is her life ultimately.  (And I won&#39;t shame<br/>\nher, afterall I ate all meats until just before she was born)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is our responsibility as parents to let our children know how we feel<br/>\nabout various issues, whether that be food, religion, schooling, or<br/>\nwhatever.  We cannot force our children to have the same views, but they<br/>\nshould be aware of why we are living the way we are (they have a right<br/>\nto know what makes us tick!).  I don&#39;t lecture my kids, but they see me<br/>\nlooking at bags in the grocery store and ask what it is that I am<br/>\nlooking for and I tell them and they help find the alternatives that are<br/>\nthe healthiest for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that my children are at a huge food advantage over myself.  I<br/>\ntruly had no idea what a healthy diet looked like as a child and most<br/>\nchildren nowadays still don&#39;t.  It is a shame since that information is<br/>\nso readily available.  Funny story:  kids and adults were talking about<br/>\nDing-Dongs and Ho-Hos and Twinkies in front of my daughter.  She asked<br/>\nwhat they were and we told her, she thought that it might be fun to try<br/>\nthem sometime.  So, next time we saw them in the store, we bought some.<br/>\nShe tried a bit of each and about gagged.  She thought the Twinkie<br/>\ntasted like air and the Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong tasted like plastic.  She<br/>\nwonders why anyone would want to eat things with virtually no flavor and<br/>\nshe immediately stopped eating them.  DH and I, however, remember how<br/>\nthese were the best food in our childhoods (and how they were rationed<br/>\nout and made out to be SO GOOD).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Lisa in AZ, the rambler once I get started<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Autistic, special needs or<br/>\nCP. I had a<br/>\n| fellow homeschooler come over to our house for a day of play<br/>\nand swimming.<br/>\n| She has a 6year old daughter that my daughter was thrilled to<br/>\nmeet. Most her<br/>\n| age are boys in our group. I hadn&#39;t remembered this child but<br/>\nfor once at a<br/>\n| park when she was 4. At that time I did notice she was happier<br/>\nto be alone<br/>\n| but when the mother said she was immature for age, I never<br/>\nthought twice<br/>\n| about it. She just seemed like she wasn&#39;t into playing with<br/>\nother kids at<br/>\n| that time.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Well as soon as the mother and daughter walked into my house, I<br/>\nknew there<br/>\n| was something different. At the end of our play day, the mother<br/>\nand daughter<br/>\n| had fun, I was uncomfortable and my kids really didn&#39;t seem<br/>\ndifferent aside<br/>\n| from the fact that they had no one to play with when they<br/>\nthought they were<br/>\n| going to. The child to me, as far as the info I have which<br/>\nisn&#39;t much, seems<br/>\n| slightly autistic. She doesn&#39;t interact at all with anyone. She<br/>\ntalks but<br/>\n| not to anyone, not the kids or me or even her mom. She never<br/>\nmakes eye<br/>\n| contact and just goes very quickly from one thing to another<br/>\nlike no one<br/>\n| else is around. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because her<br/>\nmother doesn&#39;t<br/>\n| really watch her as if there is a problem. (my mother has a<br/>\nconnecting MIL<br/>\n| quarters to our house and this little girl just walked right in<br/>\nnever saying<br/>\n| a word and went into my mother&#39;s bedroom for awhile and then<br/>\njust left) I<br/>\n| found this out later. I&#39;ve never had any child, whether<br/>\nschoooled or not go<br/>\n| through my house like that. So I had to watch her and make<br/>\ncomments when she<br/>\n| did what we don&#39;t do here in the house. Like push people and<br/>\ngrab things<br/>\n| from others and so on.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| My kids tried to play with her but it just wasn&#39;t possible.<br/>\nThey had nothing<br/>\n| to say other than she seemed to not like them. The mother gives<br/>\nno<br/>\n| indication at all that she sees a problem. She just says being<br/>\nan only<br/>\n| child, that the girl is immature. Now the only autistic<br/>\nchildren I know go<br/>\n| to special classes daily. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the best thing<br/>\nor not but I<br/>\n| can&#39;t help but wonder that maybe this child could benefit from<br/>\nsome other<br/>\n| type of help the mother isn&#39;t giving. The mother unschools in<br/>\nas far as I<br/>\n| know of, only not having work to do. I know nothing else of how<br/>\nshe is with<br/>\n| the child.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Do I say something to this mother? She frequently calls me for<br/>\nadvice and<br/>\n| marvles at how I do it with 4 kids and thanks me greatly for<br/>\nsuggestions I<br/>\n| have made that help her. Now I see things differently and<br/>\nrealize why she<br/>\n| seems to need help with things. Not usre if it&#39;s for me to say<br/>\nsomething or<br/>\n| what I would exactly say.<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Mary B<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\n| Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a><br/>\n|<br/>\n|<br/>\n| ------------------------ Yahoo!
