We can&#39;t have <br/>\n grandparents or aunts and uncles at b-days.  Having a party is part <br/>\n of what made their day special when they were younger. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDiane,<br/>\n  I agree with this! Now that our family is spread out, the boys want to make <br/>\ntheir day seem special, and I think that inviting friends over is how they do <br/>\nit. I&#39;ve also noticed that as they get older they are wanting one or two <br/>\nspecial friends to come over for the night instead of the big party thing...<br/>\n-Karen :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3353,"nextTopicId":3371}}
