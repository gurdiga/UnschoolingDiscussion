I have no idea what to do with them however! do I<br/>\ndefrost them in microwave and add noodles and a fettucine alfredo sauce or<br/>\nwhat? I am still waiting for the book Frozen Assets it was not in any of the<br/>\nbook stores near me so I e-ordered it will take a week or so.  I like the<br/>\nidea of freezing everything in ziplock baggies that you just pop in the<br/>\nmicrowave. I am exhausted just reading your menu from yesterday! I am not<br/>\nsure I have the stamina but am willing to give it a try!Your dd reminds me<br/>\nof my Melissa but she hates peanut butter and jelly and is more like a<br/>\nvegetarian like her Dad. For a few years the only thing she would eat is<br/>\ntuna fish from Trader Joe&#39;s which is a few hundred miles from our house. I<br/>\nfinally found an as good if not better brand online which works for her. I<br/>\nalso go to a coupon club online you pay a nominal fee for up to $50 worth of<br/>\ncoupons of your choice. The website info is below if you do take advantage<br/>\nplease mention my DH&#39;s name! Thanks for the inspiration! And possibly the<br/>\nchance to save more money by doing this in advance. I am a bit confused by<br/>\nall the recipes which tell you  can freeze the food raw versus cooking it up<br/>\nin advance and then defrosting it. Is there a big difference in taste?<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n             ---------------------------------------------<br/>\n              Please create a folder grocerycard and save<br/>\n                this email in it for future reference.<br/>\n             ---------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nDear Steve Burnham:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for using the GroceryCard!

I ended up with 16 meals and more to<br/>\ndo later. I did make 3 excellent smelling (and tasting) fish dishes, 2 pork<br/>\nsteak, 2 chicken, 2 ribs, 2 beef stir fry, steaks in marinade, 2 chili,<br/>\nstuffed cabbage, and a boiled dinner. I still have to do the hams, pork<br/>\nroasts, and more burger for meatloaves. I have picky eaters (dd#2 lives on<br/>\npeanut butter and apple butter sandwiches with yogurt as a side) so my meals<br/>\nare not extravagant. BTW dd#2 is underweight and tiny. She will be five in<br/>\nJuly and can still wear most 2 and 3 T outfits. Below are some of the<br/>\nrecipes...<br/>\n<br/>\nMarinated Fish<br/>\n<br/>\n2 lbs fish (I used pollock)<br/>\n1 cup lemon juice<br/>\n1/4 cup olive oil (I used one batch olive, one canola)<br/>\n1 tsp. parsley flakes<br/>\n2 tsp. oregano (or Italian seasonings)<br/>\n1 clove garlic - thinly sliced or minced.<br/>\n<br/>\nMix all ingredients (except fish) in measuring cup (less dirty dishes).<br/>\nLightly grease foil or pan. Place fish in foil and cover with sauce. Cover.<br/>\nPlace in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.<br/>\nPut covered fish in oven and cook for 40 minutes or until done (fish will<br/>\nliterally flake apart) When cooled place in Ziplok (labeled) and FREEZE!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarinated Steaks<br/>\n<br/>\nSteaks  (I bought a big round steak and cut it into 5 sections)<br/>\n2 tsp. Oregano<br/>\n1 cup canola oil<br/>\n1 cup apple juice<br/>\n2 tsp. minced onion<br/>\n1/2 tsp. powdered garlic (I am Italian, so I actually use more, but you can<br/>\nuse however much you prefer)<br/>\n<br/>\nMix all ingredients (except steaks) in Ziplok baggie. Lay steaks in baggie<br/>\nand FREEZE. When labeling, write &quot;Pan fry until done&quot;. When you take it out<br/>\nof the freezer, the steaks will marinate in the defrosting period. Then just<br/>\npan fry until finished... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you would like more recipes. I made an excellent smelling<br/>\nboiled dinner (hate the name, though) I think that it can also be called<br/>\ncorned beef and cabbage. Smells great all through the house!<br/>\n<br/>\nStay warm and full!!! :)<br/>\nRon and Stephanie<br/>\nLife&#39;s Learnings Academy<br/>\nWe REALLY get involved with our children&#39;s studies-<br/>\nWe&#39;re Homeschoolers!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6640,"nextTopicId":6634}}
