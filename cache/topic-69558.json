Perhaps school<br/>\ninterfered with his normal development in the area of attachment/pulling<br/>\naway and he is having to &quot;catch up&quot; to himself for time lost. It must<br/>\nseem like a pendulum swing in the opposite direction from withdrawn. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people/writers have suggested talking to the child before the<br/>\nchallenging situation, explaining to him what would be the desired<br/>\nbehavior and the feelings that might be expected to come up. I guess in<br/>\nthis case prior to having a visitor. This doesn&#39;t help much when the<br/>\ninterrupted conversation is an unplanned phone call or extemporaneous<br/>\ntalk with your dh. I can just imagine it, with ds asking why and how and<br/>\nthe whole history of why you want to talk to him about how he talks when<br/>\nyou are trying to talk! (LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet his leftover school pain and self-protective behaviors will<br/>\ncontinue to recede as he gains more confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I want to teach him to respect other people&#39;s needs without crushing<br/>\nhis need for information and desire to take part in the conversation.&gt;&gt;<br/>\nPeople here have found that by respecting the child, the child just<br/>\nbecomes respectful, without being &quot;taught&quot;. Jayn is so courteous to me<br/>\nand others without ever being &quot;told&quot; to be. To be honest, my dh<br/>\noccasionally is a stickler for &quot;please&quot;, but I try to discourage that as<br/>\nI don&#39;t see his asking her to say &quot;please&quot; having any effect whatsoever<br/>\non her choosing to or remembering to say it. She is terrific with<br/>\n&quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;Excuse me&quot;, and always says please when asking a cashier<br/>\nfor something.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I need to talk to other people besides my son.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you do. Isn&#39;t the lack of adult conversation a standing &quot;joke&quot;<br/>\ndirected at all parents. Remember the tv commercial when the husband<br/>\njust had to take his wife to a Shakespeare play. For situations where it<br/>\nis a private conversation, or the wrong time, some author I read (my<br/>\nfuzzy memory of which it is - I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t cite the source better)<br/>\nrecommended something along the lines of honoring the feeling, without<br/>\ngetting involved in answering the endless round of questions if you are<br/>\nnot up for it. It&#39;s along the lines of saying &quot;gee, you really want my<br/>\nattention just now. It must be frustrating to have to wait till later&quot;<br/>\nand then stopping. I&#39;m not sure how honest this is; it seems just<br/>\nmanipulative in this instance (I&#39;m all for honoring feelings when it is<br/>\nwithout ulterior motives).

My boys and dh and I always try to have a <br/>\nwin-win situation with everyone having input into the daily and not so daily <br/>\nactivities.  We compromise a lot and have respect for each others feelings <br/>\nand opinions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do recognize, however, that my boys are young and are still forming their <br/>\nown path.  They do not have the patience that I have, referring to the <br/>\ninterrupted conversation.  If it is truly a private conversation I will <br/>\nexplain this ahead of time and they will busy themselves with something else, <br/>\nthat has happened here.  That is where our years of being considerate come <br/>\nin.  They are respectful of me.  They know that I mean what I say.  They know <br/>\nthat if it isn&#39;t a private conversation they are free to be with me.  They <br/>\nusually aren&#39;t interested though.  If they have something to tell me or need <br/>\nme for something they know they can interrupt and I will listen, I will <br/>\nusually ask the adult to hold for a minute because I know that my 6 year old <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  To him, what he has to say is important, and I listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example is : I take them where they need to go, I can drive, they <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  And I don&#39;t make judgments on where they need to go.  To them the <br/>\npark is just as important as the grocery store.  We make lots of compromises. <br/>\n I think it comes down to respect and trust.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my boys forget to say please it isn&#39;t because they are trying to be mean.  <br/>\nThey are doing the best they can.  I try my best to be a good role model for <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway not sure I was any help at all.

The majority of what has been discussed lately has not been unschooling but non-coercive parenting. Your question is asking about 2 different things, IMO. Unschooling is an educational choice while NCP is a parenting style. Obviously since we homeschool our educational choice and our parenting style overlap. Which is why NCP comes up in so many of the unschooling conversations. I imagine it would be difficult to be a NCP and not unschool your child. However, I do think it is possible to unschool your child while not being a NCP.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5481202,"authorName":"Smmecca22@aol.com","from":"Smmecca22@...","profile":"suemandm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] I have an honest question...","postDate":"1053200493","msgId":69569,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzLjQxNDk5NDQ5LjJiZjdlYTZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69567,"nextInTopic":69573,"prevInTime":69568,"nextInTime":69570,"topicId":69558,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gee thanks, I try to ask a question, and get smart remarks back.

I feel stupid reoeating this, but I <br/>\nreally  want to know and understand; I don&#39;t mean to be rude or judgemental.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I have an honest question...","postDate":"1053199511","msgId":69562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJhNjJhbithOGt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYyLjJjZDRiY2IxLjJiZjdkZjdmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69558,"nextInTopic":69565,"prevInTime":69561,"nextInTime":69563,"topicId":69558,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... are running the household, which makes the house run smoother, as there is nothing to argue about.

First, some explanation of where I am coming <br/>\nfrom:<br/>\nI have been working as a home instructor for almost 20 years for various <br/>\nschool districts, so I&#39;ve seen many, many types of kids in many, many types <br/>\nof situations. I have 3 sons of my own, and started homeschooling/unschooling <br/>\nmy 13 year old son in January.  (I have a son in college, and one who will <br/>\ngraduate from high school this June, even though the school is driving me <br/>\nNUTS.)  I&#39;m trying to find that line between unschooling and a free for all.  <br/>\nIf I could do anything I wanted all day, of course I would be happy.  If I <br/>\nlet my son do anything he wants, my house runs a lot smoother.  We&#39;ve never <br/>\nhad bedtimes or meal restrictions (of their own volition, my son and I are <br/>\nvegan and another son is veggie).  We try hard not to judge others, but we&#39;re <br/>\nnot perfect.  We have very few rules in my house, but the few I have are to <br/>\nbe taken seriously: have respect for others, help when you can, have manners, <br/>\nand we&#39;re a family, not a bunch of people sharing a house.  OK, my question: <br/>\nwhen does it cross the line from unschooling into a lack of manners?  My kids <br/>\nand I and my husband may have an (almost) equal say in how the family is run, <br/>\nbut the kids don&#39;t have more say than we do.  I&#39;m getting the impression from <br/>\nsome of the posts that the kids are running the household, which makes the <br/>\nhouse run smoother, as there is nothing to argue about.  But I also don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to turn into a mother who is so nice to their kid, I get run over in the <br/>\nprocess.  I hope this is making sense.  I am NOT insulting anyone or looking <br/>\nat anyone in particular; I&#39;m asking an honest question and would like some <br/>\nhonest answers.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70176,"nextTopicId":70208}}
