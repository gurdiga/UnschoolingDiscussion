These witnesses all had different orders and contents <br/>\nthough distinct patterns were discernible. The two best known manuscripts <br/>\nproduced came to be known as the Hengwrt and the Ellesmere, and since the <br/>\nnineteenth century most editions have followed these. In the 1930&#39;s a group <br/>\nof scholars attempted to build a textual stemma for the entire poem including <br/>\nthe 20 000 lines extant in over 80 witnesses. The attempt failed because of <br/>\nthe volume of the material - the number of textual variants runs into <br/>\nmillions. Today, however, a group of researchers at four prominent <br/>\nuniversities (Oxford University, Sheffield University, De Montfort University <br/>\nand Brigham Young University) is slowly but surely carrying out the task in <br/>\nwhat is called the Canterbury Tales Project. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ludd.luth.se/~jonsson/CT.html\">http://www.ludd.luth.se/~jonsson/CT.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"hsmominoz","from":"&quot;hsmominoz&quot; &lt;Dnowens@...&gt;","profile":"hsmominoz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Fluff&quot; books","postDate":"1022094714","msgId":37274,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFjZ3FocStoaWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDguMjY5ZTQ3YjYuMmExZDAxNTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37248,"nextInTopic":37276,"prevInTime":37273,"nextInTime":37275,"topicId":37201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve read responses about so called fluff books here and how books by Shakespeare and Dickens wrote the pulp fiction of their day.

How <br/>\nabout Chaucer? I had an English Lit professor in high school call him<br/>\nthe Larry Flint of his day! <br/>\nOn to my question... Does anyone limit or restrict books their <br/>\nchildren read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good <br/>\neye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>\nexample, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and <br/>\nwhen I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and <br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t let me. She did explain what her reasons were any time <br/>\nshe did this. Usually it was something like I know you can read the <br/>\nbook, but I don&#39;t think at this time in your life you will understand <br/>\nthe issues and themes in the book... or something like that. So far, <br/>\nI have not done anything like this to my children, but have been <br/>\nwondering what I would say if Moly (8) should come to me with one of <br/>\nmy books and ask if she could read it. Then again, I don&#39;t see my <br/>\nchild bringing one of my books and asking if she could read it. I see <br/>\nme finding her wrapped in a blanket on the couch half way through it! <br/>\nI guess it all boils down to, if you have an 8, 10, 12 year old with <br/>\nreading abilities far advanced, do you take into consideration their <br/>\nemotional advancement as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: &quot;Fluff&quot; books","postDate":"1022076752","msgId":37248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDguMjY5ZTQ3YjYuMmExZDAxNTBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37236,"nextInTopic":37274,"prevInTime":37247,"nextInTime":37249,"topicId":37201,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/22/02 5:34:29 AM, rumpleteasermom@juno.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1061301321\">In a message dated 5/22/02 5:34:29 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I used to be embarrassed (a little) about that too.
