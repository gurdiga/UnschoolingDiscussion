And all of the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-57631141\">I was just thinking about having folks over and how everyone&#39;s family is <br/>\ndifferent, does things differently, expects different &quot;behavior&quot;... And all of the <br/>\nressponses about Hiedi&#39;s situation.. how the kid will probably adjust his <br/>\nbehavior to fit in with her family.. And I realized how often my kids have to <br/>\nadjust thier behavior when they are at someone elses house. <br/>\n<br/>\n   Even thier aunts, uncles, and cousins may do things differently than we <br/>\ndo.  My sister &quot;requires/makes&quot; her kids pick up thier toys from one activity <br/>\nbefore they go on to another one. So, when my kids are over there, they have to <br/>\ndo that too.  They have the option of either playing by Judys rules, or not <br/>\ngoing over to play with thier cousins. They don&#39;t like the pick up rule, but <br/>\nthey like playing with thier cousins a lot more than they dislike the rule.   <br/>\nAnna once had a friend whose family was fundamentalist Christian,and she had to <br/>\n&quot;fit in&quot; thier family if she wanted to go over there.   She really liked the <br/>\nlittle girl and had a great time with her, but she didn&#39;t like all the chores <br/>\nand rules and weird stuff thier mom made them do.   She would complain, or <br/>\ndiscuss her disappointment with me, about the stuff at Jessica&#39;s house.  I always <br/>\ntold her.. &quot;well, you dont HAVE to go over there, you can always say &quot;no&quot; you <br/>\ndont want to come&quot;  I even gave her an out.. she could always say that I said <br/>\n&quot;no&quot;  and give some excuse about going somewhere or something.   But, she <br/>\nusually opted to go over to Jessicas house and just put up with the stuff.    Well, <br/>\nnow that I think about it.. Jessica was over at our house a LOT more than <br/>\nAnna was over at hers :-)    <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72899,"nextTopicId":72907}}
