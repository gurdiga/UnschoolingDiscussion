Initially, I wanted it there for folks that had taken<br/>\nmy creativity workshop here in Pensacola, but realized it would just<br/>\nbe nice to have a safe place on the web in which we can explore our<br/>\ncreative genius selves!:)<br/>\nSince unschoolers are such creative individuals anyway, I thought<br/>\nI&#39;d share it with you all, maybe a few of you will feel a need for<br/>\nthat kind of support.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a repressed creative, yearning to break out of your shell,<br/>\nor a fully creative genius exploring freely, I hope you&#39;ll join me<br/>\nand create a wonderful list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is the group description:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Imagination tribe is a group of people, interested in supporting<br/>\none another in our creative endeavors.

We ask that all<br/>\ninformation and advice will be shared in a spirit of friendship and<br/>\ntrue desire to enable one another. New members will be moderated to<br/>\nensure a supportive atmosphere. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the only one there so far...because I haven&#39;t done my workshop<br/>\nhere yet. So it looks rather lonely right now.:) After I get my<br/>\nbusiness up and running and do the workshop a few times, I expect it<br/>\nto get more lively!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96030,"nextTopicId":96064}}
