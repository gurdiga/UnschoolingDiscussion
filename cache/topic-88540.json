The more serious the consequences the more I <br/>\nmight say.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality I have found that I actually have had little effect either way, <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s just my kids but they seem determined to learn on their own terms, <br/>\nthey usually do learn but occasionally the consequences have been very high.

They are suggestions I am making that I conceive will make his life easier.  They are not a list of things to do.  I do the same with both older daughters.  So far I don&#39;t think it has hurt us badly.  Alot of things they know where I stand with, so we don&#39;t even have to bring that up unless they do.  In fact, most things I don&#39;t talk about until they bring it up. My second daughter is in a relationship with a man that is very hard to live with.  Occasionally I will interject with I don&#39;t know why you put up with that shit.
