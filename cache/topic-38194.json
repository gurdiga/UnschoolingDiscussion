Lanora is old enough now to<br/>\nsee how some people are clueless about how great kids are.  I would<br/>\nexplain the situation to her and she would probably want to go anyway<br/>\nbecause she thinks hotels are cool.  In fact, she would probably be<br/>\nrelieved to be excused from the party.  Jonathan (4) wouldn&#39;t care one<br/>\nway or the other so I would just make sure he was free to have fun with<br/>\nsomeone there to care for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with your convictions but as long as your honest with the kids<br/>\nwhy not just get all the fun out of it that you can for all of you?  Your<br/>\ngrandfather isn&#39;t going to change or understand your objection.  I&#39;m<br/>\nafraid that instead of a happy memory for all you&#39;ll end up with hurt<br/>\nfamily members.  Perhaps it would be beneficial to show your kids that<br/>\nsometimes people are more important than convictions, not always but<br/>\nsometimes.  Maybe they will learn how to live a flexible life and retain<br/>\ntheir teachability even when they&#39;re 80.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
