Go with the animal all the way through the shipping process. <br/>\nDo NOT leave until you see it go on the belt.  They don&#39;t like you to do<br/>\nthis but insist!  If you are there, the crates won&#39;t be switched (a<br/>\nfrequent happening) and the crate won&#39;t be thrown around like just so much<br/>\nluggage.  Some planes have pressurized baggage areas just for animals.  It<br/>\nis really best to hold your plans until you can get the furry children on<br/>\none of those!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Tracy Oldfield &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tracy.oldfield@...\">tracy.oldfield@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] travelling animals, was snakes<br/>\n&gt; Date: Friday, September 08, 2000 5:26 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re looking to transport animals overseas, be very careful <br/>\n&gt; about the instructions the airline gets about them.  There&#39;s a fly-on-<br/>\n&gt; the-wall series over here about Heathrow airport, including the <br/>\n&gt; kennels and animal care centre.  Two beautiful Newfoundlands <br/>\n&gt; got shipped from Canada (a 12 hour flight) in boxes taht were too <br/>\n&gt; small, so they couldn&#39;t lie down.  The bloke who found them was <br/>\n&gt; spitting mad!  Basically, when measuring dogs for travel boxes, <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re supposed to take the full head-to-tail length and add the <br/>\n&gt; &#39;forearm&#39; length, without which, a dog can&#39;t lie down.  These poor <br/>\n&gt; animals had stood up for over 12 hours!!!  ugh!!  Here in the UK, <br/>\n&gt; they are trying to bring in &#39;pet passports,&#39; id chips or somesuch to <br/>\n&gt; reduce the time spent in Q (and the cost!  yes the owner pays for <br/>\n&gt; 6 months kenneling fees...)  And the quarantine regs are so strict <br/>\n&gt; for a good reason, rabies is rife in Europe and it&#39;s extremely rare <br/>\n&gt; here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tracy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \u000f<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12987,"nextTopicId":13040}}
