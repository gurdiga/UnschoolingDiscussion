She described herself on another list as <br/>\n&quot;a former victim of Sandra Dodd&quot; and now she&#39;s telling people she doubts I <br/>\nwrite my own essays.  That&#39;s probably actionable stuff, and I&#39;d like to know who <br/>\nshe is.  Since she won&#39;t even tell this list whether she&#39;s an unschooler, I&#39;m <br/>\nassuming she&#39;s someone who&#39;s been here before and came back under another name.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think anyone will believe the doubt she is trying to cast on my <br/>\nintegrity?  It&#39;s a shame, character assassination just for personal amusement.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the quotes about the writings:<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, you have the right to say what you feel, and so do we. I stated  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what I felt about the possibility of Sandra not being the true author  <br/>\n&gt; and I meant it. My comments are not a personal attack, but an honest  <br/>\n&gt; take on my experience with the assumed author&#39;s personality and the  <br/>\n&gt; contents of the articles. It&#39;s an opinion, not an insult.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>. . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My comments, are no different that anyone who would review an article  <br/>\n&gt; or it&#39;s author. I was actually neutral on the contents and all I  <br/>\n&gt; stated was that I don&#39;t feel Sandra is the actual author. I may be  <br/>\n&gt; wrong or right, but I  do have the right to question.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Jeva<br/>\npink lantern &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pinklantern@...\">pinklantern@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone knows her real name, could you e-mail me on the side?  Accusations <br/>\nthat I have passed someone else&#39;s words off as my own (plagiarism) or taken <br/>\nmoney on false pretenses (fraud) are pretty serious accusations.  Baseless, and <br/>\nreckless, and they serve NO useful purpose for the accuser.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY real name is Sandra Dodd.  I&#39;ve never hidden.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve never avoided direct questions about my children or my unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty sad that I&#39;m being attacked by a troublemaker in a disguise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77480,"nextTopicId":77474}}
