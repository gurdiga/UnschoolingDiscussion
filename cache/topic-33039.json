It is limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, it is all that we have in this digital forum. But, <br/>\nthankfully, not all that we have in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to define a word so that it fits into *insert person of choice <br/>\nhere* idea will only frustrate everyone since that person of choice is <br/>\ndifferent for all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAFAIK, Holt coined the term and GWS people worked the closest with him. <br/>\nEveryone else after that is just a follower. If you want to form your own <br/>\nclub, find your own word. Otherwise, its not a good idea to put people <br/>\ndown for their opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor years I ran a BBS in Germany. My colleagues spoke a little English at <br/>\nfirst, and then learned more. Eventually they even became proficient at <br/>\nslang.
