Why is vigilance and<br/>\naction not enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond thought (ooohhh!!! TWO today, and it&#39;s only 7:00am)<br/>\nHome/Unschooling parents bring many talents to the arena. Some start email<br/>\nlists, Some write for related periodicals, Some start local groups to<br/>\nnetwork for social events, Some put on info nights at public libraries, Some<br/>\nact as &quot;Secular Watchdogs&quot; (my word) making sure teh religious don&#39;t claim<br/>\nhomeschooling as their own, some travel the country speaking at conferences,<br/>\nsome write books and some focus on the political side. And many simply act<br/>\nas an example to other home/unschoolers quietly, by living their unschooling<br/>\nlives as if nothing out of the societal norm were happening. All these are<br/>\ngood and valid and important to our homeschooling futures. Just because some<br/>\nof us choose to focus on less political areas doesn&#39;t mean we are ignoring<br/>\nor denying anything.<br/>\nEveryone contributes something In Their Own Way.<br/>\nI am thrilled with the bright, hard working vigilant people at Maryland Home<br/>\nEd Association and in my own county. The are doing a great job staying on<br/>\ntop of the inevitable boundary crossing that the school system here does.<br/>\nThey have given me a great gift, to contribute in my way to our<br/>\nhomeschooling community, which is currently starting our SECOND unschooling<br/>\ngroup in the county. I (or anyone) can&#39;t focus on everything! Neither can<br/>\nwe. The school system threatening our rights to educate our own is a very<br/>\nimportant AND interesting discussion. But  I can&#39;t monopolize a homeschool<br/>\ninformation night with unschooling, &quot;But it is so important everyone MUST<br/>\nknow ALL about it!&quot; So I make my announcement, &quot;Maryland Unschooling Family<br/>\nCOnnection meets forparent support groups once a month and lots of fun<br/>\nthings for the kids all month long.
