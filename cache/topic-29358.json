It&#39;s a good feeling to have all these many<br/>\nparts and pieces - articles, columns, photos, ads, letters, etc. come<br/>\ntogether into a nice, cohesive whole. Still just amazes me how we<br/>\nkeep managing to pull it off after almost 20 years at this - and we<br/>\nstill get just as big a kick out of wrapping up an issue as we did<br/>\nback in 1984! &lt;g&gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Nice to see this list didn&#39;t implode. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No,  actually it appears quite a few &#39;new&#39; voices are speaking up.....like a<br/>\nplant with new growth.  Hope it doesn&#39;t get choked out by the sense of<br/>\nrighteousness and argumentativeness that can still be seen at times (I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to ignore it myself.....not always easy especially when coping with<br/>\nan aggravating headcold which was not in my &#39;plan&#39; for the holidays!!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Had an interesting encounter yesterday while getting my brakes fixed<br/>\n </span></blockquote>down at the local tire shop. &lt;snip&gt;... I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d<br/>\nunconsciously frowned at the word &#39;school&#39; or something to invoke<br/>\nsuch a defensive reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n this lady&#39;s intensity has been<br/>\nmaking me wonder whether or not it&#39;s a good thing that homeschooling<br/>\nis perceived as so... I dunno... wholesome? Unimpeachable? (Where&#39;s<br/>\nthat damn thesaurus when I need it? &lt;g&gt;)&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a similar experience at our family doc&#39;s office a few weeks ago when I<br/>\ntook the baby for a well check.  Our family physicain is a true gem.  His is<br/>\na homeschooling family,  and we always chat about how things are going with<br/>\nthat.  It&#39;s great to not have to put on that generic &quot;homeschooling is<br/>\ngreat&quot; face and say things are terrific ....which is what I do for most<br/>\npeople I think would not really understand.<br/>\n    Our doc said his sister was in to get her teenaged son checked and he<br/>\nwanted to introduce us.  His sister and I have a mutual friend......anyway,<br/>\nI was talking with her and eventually asked if she homeschooled.  She got a<br/>\nfunny look on her face and gave the ol&#39; &quot;Well, I could never do that.  It<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work for my family.  I don&#39;t know how you do it...I want you to<br/>\nknow I really admire you for what you&#39;re doing!&quot;  This said with a look<br/>\nwhich I read to say.....&quot;you must be crazy to take on such a monumantal<br/>\nundertaking....and you must be *something else* to be able to have your kids<br/>\naround 24-7.&quot;<br/>\n    I was taken aback somewhat...I got a strange feeling in my gut ...and in<br/>\nmy head thought,  &quot;Look lady,  I&#39;m  a mother, as you are,  and I love my<br/>\nchildren.  And not sending them to school does NOT put me in the category of<br/>\nuntouchable saint with supreme patience.  We just chose a different<br/>\nlifestyle...in fact,  I don&#39;t know how *you* manage with four children in<br/>\nthree different schools.&quot; [Her children are older than mine - one<br/>\nelementary, one in middle school and two in high school.)  Of course,  all I<br/>\ncould muster was &quot;uh, ..well, thanks.&quot;<br/>\n    This whole scene keeps coming back to me for similar reasons to what you<br/>\nmentioned, Helen.  I remember thinking later that the whole thing was so<br/>\nstrange.....wondering why she seemed to put me and this lifestyle on some<br/>\nsort of pedestal.  I have decided I need to be prepared for these types of<br/>\nencounters. maybe we (listmembers) can come up with responses which may be<br/>\nready.<br/>\n    I&#39;m aware of my own guarded statements with aquaintences vested in the<br/>\nschool process....I notice I usually say how &#39;great&#39; everything is with<br/>\n&#39;homeschooling&#39; (goodness knows what they&#39;d think of unschooling!!)  With<br/>\nfriends,  I can always talk about some of the trade-offs of this lifestyle<br/>\nvs. a &#39;school&#39; one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;On the one hand I think it&#39;s great that homeschooling has such a warm<br/>\n </span></blockquote>fuzzy rep, but on the other hand I worry about this attitude<br/>\nbackfiring, people going overboard to justify their decision NOT to<br/>\nhomeschool, and weighing in even more heavily on the school - even<br/>\nalternative school - side of the issue.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is tough....I have one friend who used to proclaim,  &quot;I could never do<br/>\nthat!&quot;  She has seen at least four friends move into or engage in a<br/>\nhomeschooling lifestyle.  And it&#39;s challenged her to see a) that she *could*<br/>\ndo it;  and b) that her friends who have done it are happy with this<br/>\nlifestyle.<br/>\n    I know for myself,  I do love this lifestyle....and couldn&#39;t imagine the<br/>\nstress of coping with my children in a school system...all the<br/>\nparent-teacher politics,   the competition between children....and between<br/>\nparents,  the car-pooling,  the schedule,  the &#39;after-school&#39; activities.<br/>\nYet I know I present the ever-rosy &quot;Homeschooling is GREAT!&quot; to those I feel<br/>\nsort of defensive around (teacher-types -or the I-could-never-do-that<br/>\ntypes),  even when going throug a rough spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I can say that as I gain more experience and insight,  I gain confidence<br/>\nin my conviction that this lifestyle is more peaceful for our family - and<br/>\nwould possibly be for many others.  And that &quot;I could never do that&quot; comes<br/>\nfrom a total lack of understanding - the &quot;school&quot; mentality is deeply<br/>\ningrained!! (myself included...at least for me it&#39;s past tense now).<br/>\n<br/>\n    I remember once a t a seminar...the presenting couple had nine children<br/>\nand homeschooled.  I was sitting with some friends I knew since<br/>\ncollege...and they seemed thoroughly amazed at this.... and I said,  &quot;Think<br/>\nabout it....with nine children,  homeschooling HAS to be simpler than<br/>\njuggling infants, preschoolers, elementary,  middle and high schoolers -<br/>\njust in terms of packing lunches, dressing everyone,  and getting them where<br/>\nthey are supposed to be.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ramblings......interested to hear other&#39;s perpectives.
