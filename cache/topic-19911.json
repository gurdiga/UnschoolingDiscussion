So many people<br/>\ngo through their weddings and don&#39;t remember it, because of the excitement<br/>\nand activity. So when it&#39;s happening, let your mind open up and record it.<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad someone told me this!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you&#39;re going to hire a photographer, make sure you like their<br/>\npersonality and that they understand your expectations. They can get awfully<br/>\npushy just to get &quot;the shot&quot;. Given my passion for photography, I knew I&#39;d<br/>\nbe *way* picky about our wedding photos, so I interviewed about 12<br/>\nphotographers and looked at their portfolios, talked with them about their<br/>\napproach, etc. Boy, there are some BAD wedding photographers out there<br/>\ncharging money!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a huge formal wedding, which is maybe not what I&#39;d choose now, but it<br/>\nwas really wonderful then (despite all the planning). One of the most fun<br/>\nthings we did is that we each created a photo collage from childhood on up,<br/>\nand then we created one of us together. It was really cool to sit down with<br/>\nmy then-DH-to-be and go through our childhood and teenage pictures. And fun<br/>\nfor our friends to be able to see the background of the person their friend<br/>\nwas marrying. Lots of people told us they really liked looking at those.  We<br/>\nalso tried to have some personal touches that really reflected us. Our<br/>\nwedding cake had an airplane on top and us sitting on a cloud, it was blue<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) and Asa (10/5/99) who spent much energy today<br/>\ndrawing &quot;wounds&quot; on their bodies with red markers in graphic detail<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19902,"nextTopicId":19913}}
