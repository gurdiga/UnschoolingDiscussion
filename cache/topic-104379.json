Neither of us came from wealthy backgrounds, although mine was not deprived either, but we have now achieved a healthy lifestyle for our 8 children though creativity and hard work.  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve never let anyone tell us we CAN&#39;T do anything!  Experiences and money are out there.  You just have to think outside the box.<br/>\nThis attitude has lead us to unschooling because we don&#39;t want our kids to be sheep.  I saw a day care class os 2yo&#39;s in the food store with their hands wrapped around a loop in a rope.  I couldn&#39;t help but think to myself that my kids could never be lead that easily.  They want to explore and touch and ask questions and it&#39;s my job to answer them!  We encourage their creativity and with that hope they&#39;ll never waste our most valuable resource-TIME.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: How unschooling works---my rant","postDate":"1110508799","msgId":104389,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzExMDIzOTU5Ljk4OTAwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"NjY2Nw=="},"prevInTopic":104388,"nextInTopic":104391,"prevInTime":104388,"nextInTime":104390,"topicId":104379,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Are you sure they were saying anyone can unschool?

Once a parent is determined to figure out how to make it work, they&#39;ll find the things they need to make it happen.  Without a conviction that it can be done, and that we&#39;ll keep trying until we get it right, it may take too long for the kids to benefit.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI suppose there are people whose situation -- disagreeable ex or something like that -- simply can&#39;t truly unschool, but most people give up on unschooling just because they weren&#39;t willing to try hard enough.  Kinda like those who give up on nursing because it gets hard at the first growth spurt, or who hate to hit their kid but never bother to look for a better answer.  I agree that there are many qualities required to make unschooling work, and lots of folks don&#39;t bother to find in themselves what it takes.  That&#39;s not to say they couldn&#39;t do it -- they just don&#39;t make it happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen again, I&#39;m not in a really generous head space today -- underslept, kid in a (heavy)leg cast, grief from my family, etc. I tend to feel if one can&#39;t make it work, one just didn&#39;t want it enough.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

I think anyone can unschool -- it&#39;s not a matter of how much a parent knows today, or how much research they&#39;ve done in the past, or past education or anything else.  I&#39;ve found that the essential qualities for unschooling is a willingness to question everything, to seek answers until you&#39;re satisfied, and then follow your heart, and your children&#39;s hearts.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI also agree that if parents just put forth what it would otherwise cost to go to even public school, that&#39;s a huge bucket of money.  I remember an article in our local newspaper last August about the high cost of getting the kids back to school.  The estimate was that parents spend $170 just on the backpack and supplies to fill it.  For uniforms, or new seasonable clothes, add another $350.  Then you have to replenish school supplies throughout the year. School lunch costs $10 a week (that was in &#39;01 when we last had one in school).  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe spend about $200 on zoo and museum memberships every year, and that&#39;s for the whole family.  I probably spend $60 a month on fuel for my car that could be saved if the boys walked to school, but then again if they were in school, I&#39;d use that fuel driving to a job because there&#39;d be no point in staying home. We buy new clothes on clearance after the school year starts, much less expensively. My kids wear flip-flops by choice virtually year-round -- can&#39;t do that in school.  For school you need sneakers every few months, at $15 a pair (if they&#39;ll still wear cheap shoes in school). Flip flops cost $3 a pair.  I can certainly feed them lunch every day for less than $10 a week each.  Field trips are included in the museum memberships, so no extra expense there.   <br/>\n <br/>\nEven tho unschooling can be less expensive than public school, it&#39;s unrealistic to think being  a parent won&#39;t cost money. <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

Those with limited abilities, who have no interest in the great big world, who---how did you put it? who &quot;may not have the financial resources or the research skills as parents to help facillitate an exposure to learning outside of the home&quot; ....well, they will probably not make very good unschooling parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of this job is to make that effort---and in SPADES! <br/>\n<br/>\nBE.
