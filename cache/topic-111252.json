On toontown you can only talk to those people you<br/>\nknow, so you exchange a secret code that toontown gives you and off<br/>\nthe game and that allows you to chat directly with the person you<br/>\nexchanged the code with.  With those individuals you don&#39;t know you<br/>\ncannot have any conversation outside of the phrases that toontown<br/>\nallots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it is clearly a human interaction.  The game makes it<br/>\nessential that you work with others.  Linnaea likes to make friends. <br/>\nSimon likes to make powerful friends. I tend to like to work with<br/>\nother people, but not necessarily to befriend them.  We have a local<br/>\nfriend who plays the game, both Linnaea and Simon will rush to her<br/>\naid, but she is less likely to help them when it isn&#39;t specifically<br/>\nhelpful to her.  One player that Linnaea befriended the other day has<br/>\ngiven her gifts.  Linnaea&#39;s favorite thing to do is to go over to<br/>\nother people&#39;s houses and try on their clothes (in the game--in person<br/>\ntoo, I suppose).

My husband found out <br/>\nbecause he had asked the boys  to go to bed and they got back up and when he <br/>\nconfronted them about it, he  saw what they had been doing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe wasn&#39;t mad over the content of the emails (photos) but that the boys  were <br/>\nbeing very sneaky about it, and lied about what they had been  doing.  We&#39;re <br/>\nnot happy, but we understand that if we were their age and  had had access to <br/>\nthe internet we may have done the same.  I asked my  husband if he thought <br/>\nhe&#39;d lie if his mom had caughter him...:o)<br/>\n <br/>\nThrough all of this, he checked out both kids my space  pages...my son&#39;s <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have anything bad on it,...lots of punk stuff,  etc.  But my daughter (15) <br/>\nhad some pictures that were a lot the way Mary  Ellen described her daughters <br/>\npictures.  No nudity, but poses that seemed  suggestive.  This is NOT uncommon <br/>\nfor a lot of  &quot;my space&quot;  pages that I&#39;ve seen (kids friends, my older <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s friends,  etc.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nBut my daughter, in her blog, admitted to doing something with a boy (not  <br/>\nintercourse) and my husband was very upset...I have to admit it made me sad  <br/>\ntoo.  She wasn&#39;t doing anything that I hadn&#39;t done at her same age, but  it&#39;s <br/>\nstill sort of a shock.   Although we were a little  disappointed, I think what <br/>\nbothers us most was that she had posted about it, and  that she tried (on the <br/>\npage) to take on the persona of a rebel child, who has  had many boyfriends, and <br/>\nit was there for everyone to see (we are from a VERY  small town.)  But I was <br/>\nquick to identify that what bothered me the MOST  was what others would think <br/>\nof ME and our family, and I&#39;ve instead put that  aside and said <br/>\n&quot;F-it&quot;...she&#39;s the one I care about and I know she&#39;s a really  good, creative, wonderful <br/>\nkid.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband at first got really upset, and deleted their my space pages, put  <br/>\ntheir AOL screen names back down to no email, no IM&#39;s, no chats, but left  <br/>\ninternet exploring open.  But after stepping back from the situation, he  <br/>\nrealized he had over-reacted.  This situation which started out as a  potential keg <br/>\nof dynomite fizzled out and calmed very quickly.  I  encouraged him to talk <br/>\nwith each kid by themselves...my daughter got teary with  him, she was really <br/>\nembarassed more than anything.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband and I went by ourselves to the store later, and we had a good  <br/>\ntalk about what we were doing at their ages, and how maybe instead of cutting  <br/>\nthem off from the world in situations like that (no IM&#39;s, no Chats, Etc) it&#39;d be <br/>\n better to spend a lot more time talking with them about their worth, self  <br/>\nrespect, respect of others (the pictures a few girls sent to my son were  <br/>\nterrible, heartbreaking that girls would feel the need to do this...), and  safety. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI have convinced my husband that if we just monitor a little more closely  <br/>\nwhat they do, but give them full access,...that, along with lots of time spent  <br/>\nwith us talking about what they see and do on the internet (especially my  <br/>\nhusband and my daughter together) then I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have much to worry  <br/>\nabout.  We talked about starting from scratch (for their My Space page) and  <br/>\nthinking about what they write, who sees it, etc,...at all times.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI just wanted to get thoughts from other parents about if something like  <br/>\nthis has ever happened at their home, whether they notified the other parents  <br/>\n(in the case of the boys), and how they handled it, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nNancy B.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] photos and the internet","postDate":"1137456878","msgId":111261,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdBNTQ3RDE3LUI3RjgtNDk4OS1BMjI2LTEzRjRGNzdDQUI5N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxN2IwMWM2MWFlZCQ3MDRhYTdmMCRjNzUzZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxN2IwMWM2MWFlZCQ3MDRhYTdmMCRjNzUzZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4="},"prevInTopic":111258,"nextInTopic":111263,"prevInTime":111260,"nextInTime":111262,"topicId":111252,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ============ Well.... it s better than assuming something terrible is likely to befall.

Yesterday, she and a friend had<br/>\nprinted some out and were folding them up with tabs that said &quot;pull&quot;.  I<br/>\nasked why they were folding the photo like that and they said it was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning when Pat (dh) brought in the newspaper he found two of the<br/>\nphotos laying in the street in front of our house.  One was close up of a<br/>\nneighbor girl puckering her lips at a photo of a boy (as if she was about to<br/>\nkiss it) and the other was Lisa holding her finger to her lips.  Pat thought<br/>\nit was strange that the photos were on the street and asked me why they were<br/>\nthere.  I said it was likely someone had dropped them, probably<br/>\naccidentally, but I didn&#39;t know and he should ask Lisa (who was asleep at<br/>\nthe time).  That led to a discussion in which Pat expressed concern about<br/>\nLisa posting photos on the internet (myspace).  His concern is sexual<br/>\npredators.  He left for work before she got up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not paranoid about internet predators.  Yes, I know that perverts are<br/>\nout there, but the risk of one effectively targeting my dd is small.  Still,<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to respond when dh gets going about the issue and I wonder<br/>\nif I am *under*reacting.  Lisa uses my computer for her blogging and I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways checked her blog from time to time and am sometimes in the room while<br/>\nshe is working on it.  She has also sometimes asked me to look at something<br/>\non her blog, so I don&#39;t think she is trying to hide anything there.  I keep<br/>\na blog too and invite her to read mine or sometimes ask her to read a<br/>\nspecific post.  I do not see everything she does on the internet (posting<br/>\ncomments to other people&#39;s blogs) or read her email unless she shares<br/>\nsomething with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the photos *could* be taken as suggestive, though I&#39;m uncertain<br/>\nwhether that was the girls&#39; intent when they took the photos.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to Lisa about using caution in choosing photos to post.  I<br/>\ntold her that there are laws about posting photos that show certain body<br/>\nparts.  I was referring to a photo of one of the girls at her birthday party<br/>\n- a close up of her breasts in a low cut t-shirt (which had not been posted<br/>\nanywhere, it was just in the folder of photos from the birthday party).  It<br/>\nturns out that Jackie (my 10yod) had taken the photo and the girl had moved<br/>\nright before she snapped it.  It was not supposed to be a close up photo of<br/>\nbreasts.  The next photo was the same girl with a nice smile.  Which goes to<br/>\nshow that it is better to find out what the intent was before jumping to<br/>\nconclusions!  I told Lisa that I thought we should delete a few of the<br/>\nphotos, rather than risk someone seeing them who might get offended.  She<br/>\nreadily agreed to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGraduate<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=XeERtAmMH6xOclFlfF3kXw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=89oOLkTPWnhxf__b2u72QA&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nHome<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Graduate+schoo</a><br/>\nl+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+scho<br/>\nol+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+california&<br/>\nc=6&s=181&.sig=1aW-X2S2ZokW3qzZ8RgBsQ&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMiddle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Middle+school+education&w1=Graduate+sch</a><br/>\nool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+sc<br/>\nhool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+californi<br/>\na&c=6&s=181&.sig=ekWG86FHE6rjFjd8jaZHOw&gt;  school education <br/>\n<br/>\nNew<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=New+york+school+education&w1=Graduate+s</a><br/>\nchool+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Middle+<br/>\nschool+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+califor<br/>\nnia&c=6&s=181&.sig=aSJE8BjHS18knvLinwtebQ&gt;  york school education <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=School+education+in+california&w1=Gradu</a><br/>\nate+school+education&w2=High+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Mi<br/>\nddle+school+education&w5=New+york+school+education&w6=School+education+in+ca<br/>\nlifornia&c=6&s=181&.sig=gkGybS6R2TNc7Ffa1FldiA&gt;  education in california <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
