Instead of having fun with my<br/>\n&gt; daughter all day Tuesday getting ready for it, I stress out big time<br/>\n&gt; and pretty much ignore the kids getting the house clean. Usually<br/>\n&gt; Monday night I do stay up until 4 am and then drag myself through<br/>\n&gt; Tuesdays exhausted, looking forward to it all being over.  I LOVE<br/>\n&gt; having the girls at my house and I LOVE the cool projects we do.  I<br/>\n&gt; just can&#39;t handle the cleaning that I do in order to prepare for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have one of the other moms (or all of them, on a rotational basis or<br/>\nwhatever works well with your group) come over an hour before each meeting<br/>\nand the two of you work on the girls club room(s) and get them cleaned up<br/>\n(even if &quot;cleaned up&quot; means a big rubbermaid bin to put all the clutter in<br/>\nand then that bin goes in the garage until after the meeting).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other mom(s) are grateful that Girls Club is not at THEIR house where<br/>\nTHEY&#39;D have to clean &lt;g&gt; and they will be happy as clams to help you out.<br/>\nHonest, they will. Just tell them, &quot;You know, I get so freaked out every<br/>\nTuesday getting ready for this that I would just LOVE some help for an hour<br/>\nbefore each meeting getting prepped -- you know, just picking up the floor<br/>\nand running the vacuum real quick and laying out the meeting supplies and<br/>\nall that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they don&#39;t line up smartly, please let me know as I&#39;ll have to come out<br/>\nthere every Tuesday myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59430,"nextTopicId":59454}}
