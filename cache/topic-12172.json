That night, we took <br/>\nour kids to a drop-in day care center that we use occassionally when our <br/>\nbabysitting options are limited.  The kids really have fun there.   When we <br/>\ngot to the center, the teacher looked at her and said, &quot;Your parents let you <br/>\ndo that to yourself?&quot;  My husband said, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot;  The teacher, who is <br/>\nreally a sweet -- if conventional -- woman, looked at us like we were crazy.  <br/>\nI was very proud of my husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband really has come a long way in the last couple of years.  When we <br/>\nwent to our first unschooling conference, my husband got to see that <br/>\nunschooled teenagers aren&#39;t particularly weird or frightening or anything <br/>\nlike that.  I think he expected that they&#39;d all be dressed in goth with pasty <br/>\nwhite faces and black lipstick.  But, no, they were a pretty mundane bunch.  <br/>\nIn fact, near the end of the conference, he was saying that they were all TOO <br/>\nwell adjusted and that just wasn&#39;t normal.  They&#39;re supposed to be rebelling <br/>\nagainst their parents at this age, he insisted.  But during the very last <br/>\nworkshop, experienced unschooling parents explained that yes, their kids did <br/>\nrebel, just like all kids, but with two big differences.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, they had more time to do it.  Parents of school kids only see their <br/>\nkids for a short time each day and get a concentrated dose of rebellion.  <br/>\nBesides, school kids are so caught up in popular culture, that their moods <br/>\nand their actions change rapidly, and parents just see this worldwind of <br/>\nchange and emotion in their kids.  Homeschooled kids are less influenced by <br/>\npeers and popular culture. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, homeschool families and unschoolers in particular are a lot more <br/>\ntolerant of individualism and experimentation and a lot more respectful of <br/>\ntheir children as people.  Allowing kids to experiment takes a lot of the <br/>\nsting out of rebellion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my husband has come to believe that &quot;traditional&quot; rebellion is in fact <br/>\nrebellion against artificial control that many parents, especially school <br/>\nparents, inflict on their children in order to gain a sense of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12171,"nextTopicId":12135}}
