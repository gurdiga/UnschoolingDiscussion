Why the child is doing something matters. Whether the child is harming himself, others, or property matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nStop a child if he&#39;s hurting anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut see protecting the world from your child as your job. It&#39;s your job until he shows he can do it himself by actually doing it. Your goal isn&#39;t to get him to obey or follow your directions. It&#39;s to help him and the world peacefully co-exist. If he shows he can&#39;t yet, then don&#39;t put him in situations where he will fail until he is mature enough to act appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t punishment! It&#39;s being kind to him and the world. If there&#39;s some activity he loves but can&#39;t handle appropriately bring it here and maybe someone will have some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the situation try to figure out what need he&#39;s trying to (inexpertly) meet. Then help him find a safer, more respectful of others, practical way to meet the need. It might mean leaving a situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is he reacting to something internal like hunger, tiredness, boredom, overwhelm? If so, tend to that. But work at noticing before he reaches that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  if he does not stop, what response is in the best interests of the child?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he doesn&#39;t stop, that&#39;s communication. He&#39;s saying that for whatever reason he can&#39;t stop. It might be tiredness or hunger. It might be he&#39;s reacting to past control by showing you that you don&#39;t control him any more. That&#39;s normal but don&#39;t put him in situations where he will act &quot;defiantly&quot; until he&#39;s recovered. Treat his recovery from control like recovery from a broken leg. For a while he&#39;s not going to be able to run let alone walk so don&#39;t ask him to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you give real examples it will be easier to explain. While explaining the theory is my favorite part, it&#39;s much easier to understand the idea when you can see what they looks like in a real context.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":338578919,"authorName":"","from":"mypersonalmessages1@...","profile":"mypersonalmessages1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"How to act in the best interests of our children?","postDate":"1423575417","msgId":75594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG1iZDFocCsxa3JlN2thQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75596,"prevInTime":75593,"nextInTime":75595,"topicId":75594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to ask for some help.
