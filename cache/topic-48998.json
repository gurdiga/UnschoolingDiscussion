In our spare time from that &lt;g&gt; we (my husband and<br/>\nI) do talk to each other and to our daughters about things they might enjoy<br/>\n-- some of those things work out, some don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we were very enthused about them joining 4H this fall because<br/>\nall of our friends had told us how marvelous it was with all the variety of<br/>\nactivities available (these are friends who have kids the same ages as<br/>\nours). Turns out, that&#39;s the case in THEIR county, but not in ours! Here,<br/>\nthere&#39;s almost nothing for the under-9/10 crowd. So it was a bummer, but we<br/>\ngot over it. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur girls try lots of different things and have lots of different hobbies.<br/>\nSome get dropped quickly or after a time or temporarily and then picked up<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s so much potentially interesting and potentially fun stuff &quot;out<br/>\nthere&quot; that I think it would be hard to run out of ideas for them, and ours<br/>\nshow no real signs of running out of ideas for themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nA hard thing for some parents is to really and honestly APPRECIATE what<br/>\ntheir little and big unschoolers are doing. They want to see &quot;academic&quot;<br/>\nlooking stuff. If I were waiting around on that, I&#39;d be one sad unschooling<br/>\nparent. ;) Occasionally my daughters do something noticeably &quot;academic&quot;.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not any more celebrated than a cartwheel would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2593<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, Oct 31, 2002, 10:36 PM<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I really thought that I had a handle on what unschooling is. The<br/>\n&gt; definitions I see here totally resonate with me. And everything I have<br/>\n&gt; read, I feel comfortable with. However, I am struggling on what it &quot;looks&quot;<br/>\n&gt; like IRL, if that makes any sense. Do you &quot;plan&quot; any learning? I believe<br/>\n&gt; whole heartedly that my boys(age 5 yrs) can and will learn without having<br/>\n&gt; curriculums to follow, and without me formally teaching them everything.<br/>\n&gt; But, I don&#39;t really get how the whole picture goes together. Do you set up<br/>\n&gt; or &quot;stage&quot; things, then see if they get interested in something, and then<br/>\n&gt; find more info and/or activities to relate to that subject? Or, do you just<br/>\n&gt; kind of go about your day with your interests and let them discover things<br/>\n&gt; on their own and ask you questions? I don&#39;t mean that I would just sit<br/>\n&gt; around eating bon-bons and not have to be present , but I guess it just<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem like we have enough excitement around here. I am worried that<br/>\n&gt; I somehow need more to spur their curiosity? They really seem bored at<br/>\n&gt; times. I keep thinking, how can they be bored already, they are only 5! I<br/>\n&gt; hope this question is clear.<br/>\n&gt; Can anyone help me understand? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48988,"nextTopicId":48999}}
