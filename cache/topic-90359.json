She<br/>\nwas talking about how the pioneers would have sent the kids to school so<br/>\nthat they would be more educated and be able to build a better life than<br/>\nbeing on the farm. I felt that she was totally missing the point of being<br/>\npioneers, and taking modern biases into the situation (understandable I<br/>\nguess), and assumptions about the pioneers attitudes. The pioneers *were*<br/>\nliving a better life. They had come from God knows where � quite possibly<br/>\nfactories and mines in Europe, or farming as tenants for someone else � and<br/>\nwere making the very best life available to ordinary people who were not<br/>\nalready wealthy. I imagine they felt being a landowner was quite a high<br/>\nstatus life � speaking as an urban apartment renter I would say it still is<br/>\nsomething to aspire to. I would imagine that some of them would be<br/>\ndisappointed if their children did not embrace being landowners themselves.<br/>\nI think we look at farmers in a different way today.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that I felt sad about was the way she insisted on killing<br/>\nthe favorite calf (or sheep?) entirely for the purpose of teaching her son a<br/>\nhard and bitter lesson � it actually infuriated me that she would put him<br/>\nthrough that much pain when they were NOT staying for the winter, and it was<br/>\ntotally unnecessary for survival. Who cares about the farewell feast if it<br/>\nmeans hurting your kids so much? She and her husband separated not long<br/>\nafterward � he was the man who seemed most to internalize the lifestyle and<br/>\nbe least looking forward to going home. Remember how much the other family<br/>\ncheated? Innersprings and trading baked goods for modern stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I too liked watching the dynamics change as the show progressed and <br/>\nwondering if I would be able to give up everything that I have <br/>\nbecome used to having to do something like that......not sure that I <br/>\ncould/would.  Well, I suppose I could, if I had no other choice but <br/>\nWOULD I, if I had the opprotunity?  Not sure.  It was really good to <br/>\nsee the two teenage girls learn some new values but also sad to see <br/>\nthem 2 months later and the father was still complaining and the <br/>\nkids were talking about how they could be in the house and not even <br/>\nknow if someone else was there with them.&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nIncoming mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.567 / Virus Database: 358 - Release Date: 1/24/2004<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nOutgoing mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.567 / Virus Database: 358 - Release Date: 1/24/2004<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143181466,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;melissa4123@...&gt;","profile":"melissa4123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Colonial House!
