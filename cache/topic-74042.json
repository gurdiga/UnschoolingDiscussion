They were nice about it but it was a short visit.And they haven&#39;t been back. <br/>\n I got tired of wasting time explaining in my own yard what i did with my life to perfect strangers. {I mean thats why i joined these lists LOL} <br/>\nAfter that I put a homemade sign with big letters beside my driveway {have a long driveway and live somewhat in the boonies} &quot;Solicitors and trespassers not welcome&quot; and we have the dogs outside and I have a bunch of &quot;Beware of the Dogs&quot; signs too. Even the mailman walks on eggshells here, LOL. Though the meter man comes right up with no hesitation.<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Ack!  That would drive me crazy!  We&#39;ve had two missionaries knocking our <br/>\ndoor down and ringing the phone off the wall for almost three weeks.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nexplained to them that we aren&#39;t interested, we are moving and nine million <br/>\nother things.  I&#39;ve asked them not to come by or call anymore (a friend&#39;s <br/>\nmom gave them my number...another GRRR altogether!) but they still come.  <br/>\nYesterday, there were four who came to the door and one was poking his nose <br/>\nin the front room window trying to get the kids to open the door and another <br/>\nwas walking around to my backyard!!    ....<br/>\nMy husband has a bumper sticker with two missionary-looking people carrying, <br/>\npresumably, a bible.  It has a large red circle around it and the picture is <br/>\ncrossed out.  I&#39;m about to slap it on my front door, tacky as it <br/>\nis.....maybe then they will get the hint!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFree online calendar with sync to Outlook(TM).<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73913,"nextTopicId":74044}}
