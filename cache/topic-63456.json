That&#39;s harder to do now<br/>\nwith various restrictions, but our 6 loves going by the office of<br/>\na doc whose 3 girls are homeschoolers - he shows her &quot;stuff&quot; and<br/>\nanswers all kinds of questions.  After seeing an X-ray, she got<br/>\ninterested.  We now have a skeleton in the corner of the kitchen,<br/>\nwearing a base ball cap, yellow kneesocks and a host of Post-It<br/>\nnote lables of different bones.
