It&#39;s usually the same <br/>\nstory my older son picks on the younger  one until he gets mad and <br/>\npounces on his brother. It doesn&#39;t seem that  anything we try is <br/>\nworking. Today the older one woke up with a black eye  and scratches <br/>\nall over his face which was the result of Starwars play gone  bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the Help.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenn&gt;&gt;<br/>\n*************************************************************************<br/>\nMaybe try to help the younger one through his feelings. <br/>\nI have 4 and they do get on each others nerves at times. Usually it&#39;s bc I  <br/>\nmissed a child who needed to snuggle or snack. <br/>\n <br/>\nI too have older and younger who play games together and there have been  <br/>\nbattles. They refuse to not play together so it&#39;s something that needs  time to <br/>\ngrow and we work it out. <br/>\n <br/>\nI would be just as concerned about the older child&#39;s space though...<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":110799,"nextTopicId":110789}}
