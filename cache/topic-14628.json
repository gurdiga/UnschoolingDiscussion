This took a little training<br/>\nbecause the kids (including the big one &lt;g&gt;) were so use to just tossing<br/>\ntheir cups/glasses in the sink to be washed.  From there I went on to food<br/>\nstorage bowls.  I got rid of all the Tupperware and Rubbermaid and all the<br/>\nmicrowave junk.  It has taken about two years because it is expensive to do<br/>\nthe switch.  But, thank the powers that be that some stores still have<br/>\nlayaways!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m now doing mixing bowls (didn&#39;t need many of these because I had a set of<br/>\nold stoneware like bread/baking/mixing bowls from my grandmother) and pots<br/>\nand pans.  I really lucked out here as I ran across a close out sale and got<br/>\na set of 3 cast iron frying pans for . . . sit down, I am not joking . . .<br/>\n$1.50!  I also ran across another sale of Martha Stewart stainless steel<br/>\npots and pans that are HEAVY and have cast aluminum bottoms.  The whole set<br/>\nwas only $79.00.  I already had a set of Revereware that was my mother&#39;s so<br/>\nI will be set in the cooking department.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor storage we are using old mayo, pickle and other glass jars.  I buy<br/>\npickle chips in huge jars and they make great storage thingys for flour and<br/>\nsugar.  I also found a great sale on some old-fashioned canning jars and am<br/>\nusing them for storage.  I&#39;ve kept old spice jars and am using them for<br/>\nbaking soda, baking powder (no aluminum) and salt that I buy in bulk from<br/>\nthe health food store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found an old-fashioned coffee pot that is all stainless steel, no<br/>\nplastic and hubby grinds his own beans (organic).<br/>\n<br/>\nHubby has cancer and IBS and when he was diagnosed we really took a look at<br/>\nwhat and how we were eating and REALLY started reading labels and we about<br/>\ndied!
