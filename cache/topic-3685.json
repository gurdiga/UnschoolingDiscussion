When the jar was filled to the top<br/>\n  and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot;<br/>\n  Everyone in the class yelled, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  The time management expert replied, &quot;Really?&quot; He reached under the<br/>\n  table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. He dumped some gravel in and<br/>\n  shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into<br/>\n  the spaces between the big rocks.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  He then asked the group once more, &quot;Is the jar full?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  By this time the class was on to him. &quot;Probably not,&quot; one of them<br/>\n  answered.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  &quot;Good!&quot; he replied. He reached under the table and brought out a<br/>\n  bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went<br/>\n  into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once<br/>\n  more he asked the question, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  &quot;No!&quot; the class shouted.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Once again he said, &quot;Good.&quot; Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and<br/>\n  began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he<br/>\n  looked at the class and asked, &quot;What is the point of this<br/>\n  illustration?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  One eager beaver raised his hand and said, &quot;The point is, no matter<br/>\n  how full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit<br/>\n  some more things in it!&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  &quot;No,&quot; the speaker replied, &quot;that&#39;s not the point. The truth this<br/>\n  illustration teaches us is: If you don&#39;t put the big rocks in first,<br/>\n  you&#39;ll never get them in at all. What are the &#39;big rocks&#39; in your<br/>\n  life, your faith, time with your loved ones, a worthy cause, teaching<br/>\n  or mentoring others,  your education, your dreams? Remember to put<br/>\n  these BIG ROCKS in first or you&#39;ll never get them in at all. So,<br/>\n  tonight, or in the morning, when you are reflecting on this short<br/>\n  story, ask yourself this question: What are the &#39;big rocks&#39; in my<br/>\n  life?
