As an adult I&#39;ve spent many years<br/>\nstudying religions, philosophies, and natural<br/>\nhealing/health-maintenance practices from all over the<br/>\nworld.  At this time I&#39;m half-way through the journals<br/>\nof Thomas Merton.  I&#39;ve enjoyed his books.  His<br/>\njournals, for me, are like sitting with an old friend<br/>\nand talking about the day&#39;s events.  He was a Catholic<br/>\nmonk and a mystic who wrote prolifically about his<br/>\nspiritual visions and his passion for improving<br/>\nhimself and the world.  The Catholic church has<br/>\ntraditions such as saints and exorcism, which implies<br/>\nacceptance of psychic phenomena.  I think that&#39;s<br/>\ninteresting to know about an organization so<br/>\nwidespread in today&#39;s world. <br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
