My husband is one of those.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat changed my perspective was that I changed my perspective.  I looked at <br/>\nthe world with a little more distance.  Inside a church, with the King James <br/>\nBible in my hand, looking out, the world looked scary and sinful.  Stepping far <br/>\naway from that church and looking at what Hindus and Buddhists believe and <br/>\npractice, then looking toward the Baptist church, it seemed very small, and new, <br/>\nand misguided.  Looking at what Jewish children are taught, and the methods <br/>\nused by rabbis who specialize in teaching children made me envious of the narrow <br/>\n&quot;just take it on faith&quot; business that passed for education when I was little. <br/>\n &quot;Sword drills&quot; (formal races to find and read Bible verses) and memorizing <br/>\nJohn 3:16 and Matthew 28:19-20.  They justify supporting missionaries, and <br/>\nwitnessing to our friends and neighbors and relatives, but they don&#39;t tell how to <br/>\nlive beyond that.  They say &quot;Do this hard thing, but it won&#39;t save you.  Only <br/>\nfaith and grace will save you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you express faith in people or human nature (as I believe are necessary <br/>\ncomponents of fluid unschooling), they will say &quot;Humanist&quot; with a nasty tone of <br/>\nvoice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Humanist&quot; isn&#39;t a bad word in the real world.  It&#39;s just a bad word among <br/>\nfundamentalist Christians who are so deeply ashamed of being human.<br/>\n<br/>\nA somewhat tacky and humorous summary of what I think about hell now that I&#39;m <br/>\nolder is here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/theology\">http://sandradodd.com/theology</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMost of it first appeared on this list, years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe the Bible is literally true, though at one time I did.  <br/>\nReading more about the history of the Bible and then reading other religions&#39; <br/>\nsacred texts cured me of the idea that the Bible was something really unique and <br/>\nspecial.  It&#39;s a collection of things of varying relative values, and not a <br/>\nmonolithic item created in a moment by a clear-eyed entity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone new to questioning that could look at The Skeptic&#39;s Annotated Bible.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/\">http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59761,"nextTopicId":86143}}
