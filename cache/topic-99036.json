When asked directly if he would<br/>\n&gt; prefer that she not tease him he was seemed surprised by her<br/>\nresponsiveness<br/>\n&gt; to the sincerity of his request.

The young girls (6-9ish) thought it was funny to taunt him and<br/>\ncall him a baby.  He responded quite funnily with his mock-sad faces, though<br/>\nhe really wanted the girls to stop, he never said so to them directly.  I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure what his thoughts were, maybe he expected the mommies to jump in,<br/>\nbut I was giving him wide berth to put a stop to it on his own terms, to<br/>\nspeak up about his own needs and as an adult, he didn&#39;t quite know what to<br/>\ndo...

I need to look at every <br/>\n<br/>\nsingle knee-jerk no that is about to escape my lips, what is behind <br/>\n<br/>\nit? Fear? Distraction?

He said, &quot;You can say no, mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But I&#39;m saying yes because I love you, and because I don&#39;t want you to <br/>\nbecome sneaky and resentful.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You don&#39;t know that will happen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But it MIGHT.  And I don&#39;t want it to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were being very light about the whole thing, joking, but when he said &quot;You <br/>\ncan say no,&quot; he wasn&#39;t joking.   <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-After 4+ more days of vacation after the conference, four+ days of <br/>\n<br/>\nYes practice, I noticed an amazing shift in my children.  They <br/>\n<br/>\nbecame YES kids &lt;bg&gt; The selfishness and knee-jerk screeches were <br/>\n<br/>\ndiminished... they felt good giving each other the gift of Yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Just for today, say YES!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana&#39;s children were some of my kids&#39; favorite buddies at the conference. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was strange, overall, to be around people in so many stages of desire to <br/>\nchange, and implementation of new ideas.    <br/>\nSome kids seemed to be too unsupervised.   <br/>\nSome were entirely unsupervised, but it didn&#39;t seem like it (because they <br/>\nweren&#39;t standing out as in need of supervision).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty told me and Joyce (and Kathryn F. and Holly D.) that of all the kids <br/>\nwho were there, there were only three or so he wouldn&#39;t have chosen to hang out <br/>\nwith.  A couple of older boys (I suspect had been to school, and one Marty <br/>\nsaid hadn&#39;t really wanted to attend the conference) did some posturing and Marty <br/>\nwas unimpressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the real world, that&#39;s not bad stats at all, three out of... how many <br/>\nkids?  Nearly 200?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling conferences are a rarified special corner of the real world, <br/>\nand there are people there in decision-making mode (especially, maybe, dads, <br/>\nand there were lots of those--65 at the all-dads/only dads meeting), and when <br/>\nsome perceived that some parents were giving blanket &quot;yes&quot; without judgment, it <br/>\nmight&#39;ve (did in a case or two) made them nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet for every story of questionable behavior, I probably heard three glowing <br/>\nreports of generosity, courtesy, older kids helping younger ones, kids hanging <br/>\nout with adults without any awkwardness, etc.  So it wasn&#39;t a big problem at <br/>\nall.  It was a little twitch some people commented on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana","from":"&quot;diana&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: On becoming a YES parent","postDate":"1094254536","msgId":99037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoYXY0OCs0cDY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNoYXNwdSsxMG9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":99036,"nextInTopic":99043,"prevInTime":99036,"nextInTime":99038,"topicId":99036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, that was what it *feels* like, I should show you what it *looks* like :) Pre-conference: Hayden and gas stations and mom s bad attitude: He MUST go in,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-96914687\">Well, that was what it *feels* like, I should show you what it <br/>\n*looks* like :)  <br/>\nPre-conference: Hayden and gas stations and mom&#39;s bad attitude: He <br/>\nMUST go in, he MUST look at ALL the candy available, he MUST compare <br/>\nthe prices to get the best deal, he MUST tell me what everyone he <br/>\nknows would buy if they were in the store, this MUST last 15 minutes <br/>\neven when we have 3, I must SIGH and roll my eyes and rush him right <br/>\nalong.  <br/>\nPost-conference: Hayden and gas stations and mom&#39;s YES attitude: <br/>\nHayden, come on out, we&#39;re at the gas station, doncha want a treat?  <br/>\n&lt;bg&gt; We&#39;ll be sure to tell Lincoln that we thought of him when we saw <br/>\nthat candy in New York.  At one stop he had only a quarter to spend <br/>\n(the atm was out of order, I had NO cash), I tried for 15 minutes to <br/>\nconvince him [blah, blah, blah, blah at its finest] there was nothing <br/>\nin the entire place for 25 cents, not even one machine.  A man walked <br/>\nby and said &quot;good luck mommy&quot; and it was enough of a distradtion for <br/>\nme to realize exactly what I needed to do, I let Hayden go into the <br/>\nstore and look around, while I took a deep breath.  I gently <br/>\nsuggested he ask the clerk what was available for him... the clerk <br/>\nsadly said no and we left.  We got in the car, he was disappointed, <br/>\nbut not in me ~ I got the chance to listen and empathize, be on his <br/>\nteam.

(yes, that Some Parts Are Meat stuff in the <br/>\nblue can, they have a museum) Hayden and David were revved but Hannah <br/>\nhad just awakened and a museum was not high on her list of wants for <br/>\nthe day. I stayed in the car with her, I knew David would come out <br/>\nand tell us if it was cool and would even take a shift in the car <br/>\nwith her so I could go in with Hayden.  As soon as it was understood <br/>\nthat she did indeed receive a YES you can stay in the car and not go <br/>\nin, she says, &quot;you&#39;re a YES mom and I want to be a YES daughter so <br/>\nlet&#39;s go in.&quot;  We had a great time, it is corny and funny, you should <br/>\nsee us in our SPAM assembly line outfits!  I even went so far as to <br/>\naccept a few samples... my lifetime quota has been met, but I&#39;m a <br/>\nteam player!  <br/>\n<br/>\n:) diana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194790463,"authorName":"diana","from":"&quot;diana&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"On becoming a YES parent","postDate":"1094252158","msgId":99036,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNoYXNwdSsxMG9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":99037,"prevInTime":99035,"nextInTime":99037,"topicId":99036,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The greatest gift I received at the conference was the challenge and permission to become a YES parent.

I attended the conference with <br/>\nsomeone who had never heard of unschooling until we met 10 weeks <br/>\nago.  We climb into the car after the conference and he admits, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nreally uncomfortable with the whole &#39;just say yes&#39; thing.  How can <br/>\nyou really raise kids without telling them no; isn&#39;t it the same <br/>\nthing as letting them run all over you?&quot; I had to really think about <br/>\nthat... luckily he was my captive audience for the trip home and I <br/>\nwould have lots of time to form my answer.  What I realized is that <br/>\nit&#39;s not really about saying yes; as if saying yes is the symptom of <br/>\nmy examination of every no in my book.  I need to look at every <br/>\nsingle knee-jerk no that is about to escape my lips, what is behind <br/>\nit? Fear? Distraction? Most of the time, it is one of those two <br/>\nthings... Do I want to spend my life with my child being afraid?  Do <br/>\nI want to spend it being distracted?  Saying yes to my child forces <br/>\nme to be present and forces the voices of fear to quiet, even just <br/>\nfor a moment.  I will say no again, I just know it... but it will <br/>\nreally mean something because my children will understand it is a <br/>\ntruly thoughtful response and not just the first one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 4+ more days of vacation after the conference, four+ days of <br/>\nYes practice, I noticed an amazing shift in my children.  They <br/>\nbecame YES kids &lt;bg&gt; The selfishness and knee-jerk screeches were <br/>\ndiminished... they felt good giving each other the gift of Yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust for today, say YES!<br/>\n<br/>\n~diana :)  <br/>\nFor all that has been, I say THANKS.  <br/>\nFor all that is to be, I say YES!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":99040,"nextTopicId":99080}}
