It <br/>\nwas very good and brought up a lot of issues for discussion. (We sat <br/>\nin the back, so I&#39;m hoping that all of our talking through the movie <br/>\ndidn&#39;t bother anybody - nobody shushed us, anyway!) If you&#39;re not <br/>\nfamiliar with the movie, it&#39;s based on the true story about the 1965 <br/>\nNCAA basketball championship where the west Texas coach started 5 <br/>\nblack players - the first time in basketball history. My son asked <br/>\nquestions all through the movie, mostly about the racism in the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as rentals go, my son&#39;s current favorites are the Horatio <br/>\nHornblower series (we&#39;ve been getting them from the library). <br/>\n<br/>\n~Carri Ann~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111225,"nextTopicId":111311}}
