The frequency is just an accessory after the fact.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget, no one is saying that you&#39;re wrong to homeschool the way you do.<br/>\nIt works for you and your family.  Each family has an individual style.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat people here are saying is that by &quot;requiring schoolwork&quot; even if the<br/>\ncontent of such is of their choosing, then that is not true unschooling,<br/>\nwhere all of life is learning and isn&#39;t divided into any subjects.  Nobody<br/>\nreally cares how you homeschool, just that you not hold yourself out as an<br/>\nexample of a true unschooler, for reasons already stated numerous times.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are a good parent and are doing fine by your kids.  This list is for<br/>\nopening up your eyes to possibilities you may not have considered before (ie<br/>\nrelaxing even more with schoolwork and life) and trusting that your<br/>\nwonderful kids will make the right choices.  They will learn a lot about<br/>\nlife if they are allowed to make mistakes.
