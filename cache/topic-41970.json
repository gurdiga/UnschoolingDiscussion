I can t","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1808298674\">There&#39;s a lot of talk about what to talk about lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen was the last time anyone posted something here that was actually about<br/>\nUNschooling? I can&#39;t remember it. Our list owners and managers and wanna-be<br/>\nmanagers keep asking us to talk about unschooling, and stop talking about<br/>\nother things, and those &quot;other things&quot; seem to depend on the whims of those<br/>\nmanagers. My two or three months here should be enough for me to get an idea<br/>\nwhat is acceptable, but I still have no idea, because the managers keep<br/>\nmoving and removing the goalposts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that UNschooling starts with &quot;un.&quot;  Unschooling is not<br/>\nsomething that we DO; it&#39;s something that we DON&quot;T DO, and it inevitably<br/>\ninvolves WHY we don&#39;t do it. School is the elephant in the middle of our<br/>\nroom, andaccording to the managers, we&#39;re not supposed to talk about it.<br/>\nHmmm<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t do school because we believe it is bad for our kids, and because we<br/>\nbelieve we can give them a better experience than the schools can. But now,<br/>\nto talk about WHY that is true is not acceptable because it just might<br/>\ninvolve comparisons between what we do and what schools do to children, and<br/>\nwe are admonished from hurting anyone&#39;s feelings or pointing out how school<br/>\npeople, even though some are well-meaning, are damaging children every day<br/>\nof their working lives while telling us that what they do is &quot;for the<br/>\nchildren.&quot; It seems obvious to me that if they really wanted to do something<br/>\nfor the children, they would change the schools or quit working for them.<br/>\nBut they do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have a problem here. Ours is a &quot;negative practice.&quot; It&#39;s NOT-<br/>\nschooling. So how does one talk about NOT-schooling without mentioning<br/>\nschooling? Lately, many posts, from the list managers in particular, have<br/>\ncomplained that the conversation is NOT about unschooling, but even they<br/>\nhave not contributed examples of what they want us to talk about. The reason<br/>\nis that there is really not much we can talk about because of that &quot;UN.&quot; If<br/>\nall this list is about is talking about what we did today as parents, we<br/>\nmight as well change the name to Parenting.com  and leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI even got blasted because someone thought I called this a &quot;support group&quot;<br/>\neven when I didn&#39;t. &quot;It&#39;s a discussion group,&quot; she said.  I have to ask,<br/>\nWhat do support groups do? They discuss issues relevant to an activity. That<br/>\nmakes this a support group, doesn&#39;t it? Today, one poster even said that she<br/>\ngets &quot;support&quot; from this list. Is there anyone who doesn&#39;t? So why the<br/>\nhassle about calling it what it is - a support group?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this really &quot;School-anon.&quot;? Is it for school rehab...a place for people<br/>\nwho are trying to kick school to come for ideas about NOT-schooling. Is this<br/>\na list for newbies to come to have their hand held by experienced<br/>\nschool-anoners to help them get through another day? Or is it a focus group<br/>\nof some kind, considering the pros and cons of various degrees of schooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n Can that exist as a discussion group without some discussion about how to<br/>\nkeep and maintain the right to do it? We hear from unschoolers every day,<br/>\nyes on this list, who are hassled by their local school district. Are we not<br/>\nto talk about that? Are we not supposed to offer them suggestions about<br/>\ndealing with corrupt and dishonest superintendents and principals? Those<br/>\nsituations are part of why we are all here...we are in the process of<br/>\nescaping from them and hoping that we can create a world in which our<br/>\nchildren will not be required to fight so hard for their own rights in<br/>\nraising their kids in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we remove the one thing -- school -- that was, for virtually all of us,<br/>\nthe central focus of our lives (outside of home) as we grew up, most of us<br/>\nfeel a huge void. If we can&#39;t talk about the school we left behind and why<br/>\nwe reject it, we can&#39;t talk about much. Unschooling doesn&#39;t give us much to<br/>\ntalk about other than trying to raise our kids one day at a time. The idea<br/>\nis NOT to do to our kids what the school system did to us -- waste a lot of<br/>\nour youths.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have trouble imagining our lives without having gone to school all those<br/>\ntwenty thousand hours and being preoccupied with it for most of the rest of<br/>\nour youths. And we can&#39;t talk about unschooling outside the context of our<br/>\nown school experiences. It will take another generation to be free of the<br/>\nmonkey on our backs. Our kids will take the baton from us and talk<br/>\ncoherently about unschooling because they will not be schooled half to<br/>\ndeath, as we have been. They will know the freedom. We cannot.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can only try to imagine it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry an analogy: If this were a group devoted to UNreligion, could we talk<br/>\nabout being unreligious without the context of religion? I believe it is the<br/>\nsame with schooling. Can we imagine asking a minister for permission to<br/>\nbecome unreligious? Could we talk about not having a god without discussing<br/>\nwhat that is?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though the homeschooling revival has been going strong for over twenty<br/>\nyears, most people engaged in it are &quot;new&quot; to it, and most of them, like I<br/>\ndid at first, feel as though they are pioneering, going against a flood,<br/>\nsurely breaking some law even if they can&#39;t find one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are calls to &quot;move on&quot; but to what? Will they tell us? My own grief<br/>\nfor my kids damaged by school has made me devote myself to helping others<br/>\nescape that same damage. Yes, my kids were hurt twenty years ago, but the<br/>\nschools are just as terrible today, if not worse, so how are we supposed to<br/>\n&quot;move on&quot;? Some people here seem terrified by the schools they have just<br/>\nescaped. Are they supposed to simply &quot;move on&quot;? How do you mean that?<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Talk about UNschooling !&quot; comes the demand. There is little about<br/>\nunschooling that can be talked about in the strict confines of the request.<br/>\nEveryone in the practice of unschooling deals with the restrictions placed<br/>\non us by the school system, the state, the &quot;children and families&quot; agencies,<br/>\neven pressures from neighbors and relatives. Those are the subjects that a<br/>\nlist like this rightly addresses, and until homeschooling stands on firmer<br/>\nlegal ground, and  unschooling is much better understood and accepted, the<br/>\nmembers will be plagued by those forces, and yes, they damned well need this<br/>\nto be their support group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let&#39;s hear from the leaders...Talk about Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nNed Vare<br/>\nPS Unschool: Live your life as though there were no such thing as school.<br/>\nAnd, if you will, do what you can to make schools mind their own business<br/>\ninstead of yours.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42271,"nextTopicId":42290}}
