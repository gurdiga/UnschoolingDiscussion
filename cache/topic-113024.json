She is president of the Recreation Students Association and is  <br/>\nearning certificates in &quot;Outdoor Education,&quot; &quot;Event Planning,&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;Environment and Land Management,&quot; along with her bachelor degree.  <br/>\nLast weekend, she was the honored guest at the California State Parks  <br/>\nand Recreation Association annual conference.

The company he works for gives a small, but significant in this rural area, scholarship every year to a graduate from the local high school.  He is involved in the process of choosing the recipient this year & was commenting on how dismal all of the candidates are and mostly was surprised that although most of them had 3.4+ averages at school, they only scored about 650 on the SATs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sparked a great conversation about success & how public school&#39;s idea of success is all about numbers (including $$&#39;s) and the process of &quot;teaching&quot; kids and testing them only keeps them from learning how to think for themselves.  That&#39;s why they have trouble in college, no one is babysitting them thru an assignment.  No one offers a list of ideas when a paper is due.  Suddenly, they are required to think for themselves and without a parent on hand to make sure they make it to class.  LOTS of kids change majors many times, spend 5 or more years trying to get a degree all the while having a great time spending their parent&#39;s money.  It&#39;s no wonder they don&#39;t know what kind of job interests them, or what kind of classes might be fun.  And it&#39;s no wonder that they get upset when their first job is one that makes them unhappy, because they&#39;re working where their friends work and still following the crowd rather than their own interests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids raising in schools don&#39;t really know what they are interested in without someone telling them, even if that someone is the crowd.....<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] adult unschoolers","postDate":"1143306486","msgId":113032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGMwMWM2NTAzMiQ0NmJmODAyMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxNTI2Mjc5MkI1Q0U5NURBQzFFNUIwOTlEQzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":113031,"nextInTopic":113033,"prevInTime":113031,"nextInTime":113033,"topicId":113024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"=-=-=-=-==He s a big skeptic about the whole radical unschooling thing and wants to know if your children have gone on to make a living in the real ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-110853104\">=-=-=-=-==He&#39;s a big skeptic about the whole radical unschooling thing and <br/>\nwants to know if your children have gone on to make a living in the &quot;real <br/>\nworld&quot;.-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could ask him to tell you about grown up schoolers and how going to <br/>\nschool guarantees that you will be able to make a living (not).<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128961575,"authorName":"vicki a. dennis","from":"&quot;vicki a. dennis&quot; &lt;vicki@...&gt;","profile":"vickitexan2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] adult unschoolers","postDate":"1143299633","msgId":113030,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzEwMWM2NTAxZSRiYjFmZWIzMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBiaWdtYW1hPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMC1EQVYxNTI2Mjc5MkI1Q0U5NURBQzFFNUIwOTlEQzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":113024,"nextInTopic":113031,"prevInTime":113029,"nextInTime":113031,"topicId":113024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest is a software engineer  with a good  salary. #2  son  is still in college and only has paid employment for about 12 hours a week.
