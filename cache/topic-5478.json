My three boys (9,11, 12) are heavily into Pokemon here.  We discuss the<br/>\nmarketing/consumerism aspect of Pokemon frequently.  I&#39;ve told them they spend<br/>\ntheir own money on it, I will no longer help pad someone&#39;s already overinflated<br/>\nbank account.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne good thing that&#39;s come out of our Pokemon craze . . . I no longer have to worry<br/>\nabout their ability to &quot;learn&quot;.  They know everything there is to know about<br/>\nPokemon.  And in the future, they&#39;ll learn how much of their &quot;hard earned&quot; money<br/>\nthey spent on it.  A good life lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends in our local Catholic hs group that would never allow their children<br/>\nto become involved w/Pokemon.  (One mom won&#39;t even allow her children to watch<br/>\nArthur because they are unkind to one another.)  I respect their decision for their<br/>\nfamily.  I only ask that they respect my choices for what works for us.  I<br/>\npersonally think Pokemon will not harm their souls--and that&#39;s what we judge our<br/>\ndecisions on in our family.  (Oh, we watch Arther, too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll also let my 12 yr old read the original post and all the replies.  It&#39;ll be a<br/>\ngood springboard for discussion . . .  economics, religion, tolerance, marketing,<br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5476,"nextTopicId":5472}}
