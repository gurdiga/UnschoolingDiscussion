Listen to Mos Def, Common, Lauryn Hill, the Roots, the <br/>\n&gt; Nappy Roots and many others and I dare you to paint rap with the <br/>\n&gt; broad brush of pornography.  I cannot stand when white people who&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; only heard what the mainstream media dishes out stand on a soapbox <br/>\n&gt; and insult an entire art form with little knowledge.  No one would <br/>\n&gt; think to call all rock music pornography based on stuff like &quot;I want <br/>\n&gt; to F--- you like an animal&quot; by Nine Inch Nails or Erotica by Madonna <br/>\n&gt; (or countless others)  But you know what rap is still a largely black <br/>\n&gt; artform, so it&#39;s ok, right?  You&#39;d be much better off questioning why <br/>\n&gt; this is what children are attracted to.  Why is mainstream culture in <br/>\n&gt; general so full of sex and violence?  It didn&#39;t begin with rap <br/>\n&gt; music.  I don&#39;t apologize at all for being a rap fan.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cherry in GA<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree with Cherry. Although I am not a big rap fan, (if at all) I do like <br/>\nEminem, and so do my kids. The point though, is that Bob&#39;s post shows a very <br/>\nracist view. He states that Mom and Dad will have to deal with reality when <br/>\n&quot;rich, white, Johnny skips karate to rape the 12 y.o. down the street&quot; so he <br/>\ncan &quot;keep it real like his homies&quot;. I assume by the word homie, Bob is <br/>\nreferring to the young black American male. And I gather from his post that <br/>\nBob thinks that if this hypothetical rich white boy listens to the poor black <br/>\nboy&#39;s music then the rich white boy will be just like the black boy. To <br/>\ncategorize all young, poor, black youth as a drug abusing (or selling) gun <br/>\ncarrying, gangbanging, rapist is a sad statement on Bob&#39;s knowledge of black <br/>\nAmerica. His blanket statement that says if we allow our &quot;rich, white (all <br/>\nAmerican) boys&quot; access to rap, they are going to be just like the black boy <br/>\ndown in the hood, is crap, and racist! BTW Bob, Eminem isn&#39;t gansta-rap, he <br/>\nis white (not that that matters) and many of his songs talk about men like <br/>\nyou. <br/>\n~Nancy who doesn&#39;t think twice about her kids listening to Eminem, Jennifer <br/>\nLopez, Britney Spears, Celtic music, folk music, disco, Run DMC (do they even <br/>\nrap anymore?)
