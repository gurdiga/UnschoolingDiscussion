Though we both read the<br/>\ne-mail and have eleventy dozen e-ddresses though various<br/>\nwebpages, it is just easier to run it through one clearing house.<br/>\nMost of the approximately 700 messages that come in every day are<br/>\nautomatically sorted into the right folder - most of the folks we<br/>\nwrite to hear only from one or the other of us.   Our son and<br/>\nD-i-L have the same setup - it never occurred to me that it would<br/>\nbe worth the effort to maintain separate e-dresses; it is enough<br/>\ntrouble to balance 2 checkbooks.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Alan & Brenda Leonard&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:abtleo@...\">abtleo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 29, 2003 4:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3383<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| 4/29/03 19:20:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &gt; I always wonder about people who don&#39;t have their own email<br/>\naddress, but<br/>\n| &gt; share one with a spouse.
