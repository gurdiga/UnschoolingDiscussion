Each one means a different number. one block is a square. two is equal to two &quot;ones&quot;, and so forth. I don&#39;t know about the wooden ones, but the plastic ones we have are all each a different color for each number representation.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have some of the plastic ones, the kids just use them as building blocks. I think they&#39;re good for fine motor skills; they don&#39;t seem to use them much right now. Some parents who school will have their children use them to work out math problems, etc. in a visual way. <br/>\n <br/>\nMamaBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything I need to know, I learned on my own!<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
