Her dad always takes this day off.  After breakfast,  we usually play<br/>\na game,  then head to a local toy store that sends a &quot;key&quot; to the castle<br/>\nevery year.  DD gets to pick a gift from the birthday castle,  then another<br/>\ngift of her choice (slim pickin&#39; most years!).  I get a weird kick from<br/>\nseeing some frantic last minute shoppers dashing around crazily.    We used<br/>\nto stop for lunch after at a playland place (which also sent b-day coupons),<br/>\nbut dd lost interest in that a few yrs ago.<br/>\n    Late that afternoon we pack up and head to Grandma&#39;s for the Christmas<br/>\nEve get-together with the aunts, uncles and cousins from my side of the<br/>\nfamily.  Usually get home late at night and sprinkle some &quot;reindeer food&quot; on<br/>\nthe lawn (a tradition started when dd went to preschool), and get to bed.<br/>\n    Christmas day is relaxed,  at home, reading Christmas stories. We talk<br/>\nabout it being Jesus&#39; celebrated b-day (especially since dd&#39;s was the day<br/>\nbefore). Dh cooks a nice meal,  we go to Mass.  And enjoy the day together.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30121,"nextTopicId":30125}}
