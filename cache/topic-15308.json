Cut a<br/>\nwhite pipe cleaner into 3 equal sections. Twist the<br/>\nsections together in the center so that you have a<br/>\n&quot;six-sided&quot; star shape.  <br/>\nPipe cleaners and string form a snowflake base for the<br/>\ncrystals to grow on.  <br/>\nIf your points are not even, trim the pipe-cleaner<br/>\nsections to the same length. Now attach string along<br/>\nthe outer edges to form a snowflake pattern. Attach a<br/>\npiece of string to the top of one of the pipe cleaners<br/>\nand tie the other end to a pencil (this is to hang it<br/>\nfrom). Fill a widemouth jar with boiling water. Mix<br/>\nborax into the water one tablespoon at a time. Use 3<br/>\ntablespoons of borax per cup of water. Stir until<br/>\ndissolved, (don&#39;t worry if there is powder settling on<br/>\nthe bottom of the jar). If you want you can add a<br/>\nlittle blue food coloring now to give the snowflake a<br/>\nbluish hue. Insert your pipe cleaner snowflake into<br/>\nthe jar so that the pencil is resting on the lip of<br/>\nthe jar and the snowflake is freely suspended in the<br/>\nborax solution. Wait overnight and by morning the<br/>\nsnowflake will be covered with shiny crystals. Hang in<br/>\na window as a sun-catcher or use as a winter time<br/>\ndecoration. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave Fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSamantha<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
