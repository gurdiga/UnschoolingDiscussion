Because of <br/>\ndrainage from the mountain above us, we have more iron in our yard than is <br/>\nnatural or average, so Marty has collected a couple of pounds of it.  He has <br/>\na piece of magnet that came out of a speaker that a friend gave him.  He puts <br/>\nit in a ziploc bag, ties a string to the bag, drags it around and then turns <br/>\nthe bag inside out and removes the magnet to collect the iron dust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis won&#39;t work everywhere, but you might find other stuff I could never find <br/>\nin my yard, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128897139,"authorName":"love-it-here@juno.com","from":"love-it-here@...","profile":"wendes2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Rocks","postDate":"1044816059","msgId":58341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMjA5LjEzNDEwMS4tMzU1NzE3LjEubG92ZS1pdC1oZXJlQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58366,"prevInTime":58340,"nextInTime":58342,"topicId":58341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sun, 9 Feb 2003 12:11:38 -0600 Olif VanPelt  ...

Make jewelry for presents.<br/>\n5) Visit a quarry and watch them in operation.<br/>\n6) Make a crystal garden.<br/>\n7) Collect larger interesting rocks and make a rock garden. Research what<br/>\nplants and animals would prefer this type of environment, and add them to<br/>\nthe garden.<br/>\n8) Visit a coal mine.<br/>\n9) Put a handful of dirt in a paint strainer. Pour water through it till<br/>\nonly sediment remains.
