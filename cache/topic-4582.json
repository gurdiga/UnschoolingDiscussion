I think your views are shared by most people. But it could be<br/>\nme in my own box.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a great little, short book called &quot;How People Change&quot; by Alan<br/>\nWheelis.  It is a great discussion of the dynamics between personal<br/>\nresponsibility and &quot;blame&quot;.  People are responsible for their actions.  There<br/>\ncertainly is such a thing as &quot;diminished capacity&quot;.  When I drank, I did things<br/>\nthat I wouldn&#39;t have done sober.  I still chose to drink and so if my judgment<br/>\nwas impaired I had certainly chosen to diminish it by drinking.   I also did<br/>\nthings stone cold sober that I wish I hadn&#39;t done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you would read Alice Miller and let me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really convinced that there is a major internal &quot;psychological&quot; barrier to<br/>\nlooking at these issues dispassionately which Alice Miller expands upon.  It<br/>\nhas to with &quot;childish&quot; investment in parental approval.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour description of your mother&#39;s behaviour (from my point of view) is one of<br/>\nabuse ...clear but of course not simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes people make choices.  People&#39;s choices are shaped by their previous<br/>\nexperience.  It is very difficult to make choices about which you have limited<br/>\nor no experience. People struggle within the limitations of their experience.<br/>\nEffective &quot;therapy&quot; is in fact a little world of alternate experience which<br/>\nallows people to have experiences that they would never &quot;choose&quot; because those<br/>\nexperiences are outside their &quot;box&quot; of choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was adopted at five and remember much of my earlier childhood.  For me the<br/>\nexperience was a kind of inoculation against taking anything at face value.  It<br/>\nmade me suspicious, anxious perhaps even paranoid.  These qualities are two<br/>\nedged swords.  I am perceptive in a way I wouldn&#39;t have been and yet limited in<br/>\npersonal relationships, in ways which are a constant struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI clearly see the connection between my &quot;then&quot; and my &quot;now&quot;.  I see the<br/>\nchallenge of change.  It is constant struggle, one which I would often rather<br/>\nnot have.  I am painfully aware that choice is mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of why people with similar experiences make different choices is<br/>\nof course central to this discussion.  I believe that people who make<br/>\nconstructive choices in spite of their painful experiences have had (to borrow<br/>\nfrom Alice Miller) &quot;witnesses&quot; to what was done to them.  People who choose<br/>\n&quot;destructive&quot; roads have not had &quot;witnesses&quot;.  this is at least one piece of<br/>\nthe puzzle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really glad that (thus far) this discussion (this time) has not resulted<br/>\nin anyone going off in a snit.

I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to spend very much time doing it so I will try to cut to the chase.<br/>\n<br/>\n People&#39;s belief systems shape the way in which they view &quot;evidence&quot;.  It is<br/>\nclear to me that preconception and a refusal to even entertain the notion that<br/>\nperpetrators could have been victimized will color your perceptions.  Of course<br/>\nwith the current criminal Injustice system, lawyers will coach clients to<br/>\nexaggerate, fabricate and such like to avoid punishment.  This does not do away<br/>\nwith the fact that most people who have been abused don&#39;t have an actual<br/>\nunderstanding of what was done to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had patients for years now who repeatedly describe horrendous stories in<br/>\nneutral tones.  They are not trying to impress me with anything.  They think<br/>\nthey may have had some rough times but mostly they think they got what they<br/>\ndeserved.  I wish I would get paid for the number of times I have been told<br/>\nbasically &quot;Well yeah my dad (or fill in the blank) beat the s**t out of me but<br/>\nI was really a troublemaker when I was a kid.&quot;  The majority of these folks<br/>\ndon&#39;t think corporal punishment is a bad thing..<br/>\n<br/>\nYour analysis of the origins of deviance seems to be missing.  Are these<br/>\noffenders just bad, self-indulgent malingerers who enjoy hurting people?  They<br/>\ndon&#39;t need approval?  They have good self-esteem and social skills?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your explanation for offending behaviours? What is recitification?  Are<br/>\nyou referring to recidivism?  Obviously punishment does not deter crime.  The<br/>\nUS has more people locked up and under the criminal justice system than just<br/>\nabout any other country and yet has more crime than just about any other<br/>\nindustrialized country.  So what is the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you explain the correlation between social class and incarceration?  Are<br/>\npoor people just &quot;bad&quot; people who &quot;naturally&quot; offend?  Is it a matter of<br/>\n&quot;character&quot;? Some people are just born with bad character?  Can people change?<br/>\nHow?  Does parenting have anything to do with how children behave?  If it does<br/>\nthen how much responsibility do parents have for the crimes of their children<br/>\nif any?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to support the idea of child-like justice.  The harsh views of<br/>\nchildren should not be our model for justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain there are studies which are not just self-reporting surveys.  There are<br/>\nother ways of knowing whether or not someone has been hospitalized for having<br/>\nbeen beaten by a parent than asking them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour anger, disgust, objectification and loathing of offenders comes through<br/>\nclearly.  I think it clouds your thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share your rage at people who hurt other people.  I have enormous empathy<br/>\nwith people victimized by others.  I have worked with offenders and victims. My<br/>\nexperience is that they are both fundamentally human, capable of change, and<br/>\nplagued by the same problems as all of humanity.  I believe there are a very<br/>\nfew individuals completely broken who are dangerous to everyone around them who<br/>\nmust be kept from harming people because they will harm people regardless of<br/>\ntheir stated intentions.  These are exceptions.  There are no more of these now<br/>\nthan in any other time in history.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally your crime statistics leave a lot to be desired. We are emerging from a<br/>\nhistory wherein slavery, murder and stealing were basic facts.  Criminal<br/>\nbehaviour in many instances was socially sanctioned.  You look to days of yore<br/>\nwhere we were happy and there wasn&#39;t much crime. Depends on who you were.<br/>\nRacial and ethnic minorities, women and children?  I don&#39;t think so.  You seem<br/>\nto ingest the social prejudices of our society and you don&#39;t seem to have<br/>\ndigested them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t seem to be brief.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease provide answers to the questions I have asked so we might continue the<br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Having worked with the prison population, I can vouch for the &quot;fact!&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; most of the molestation and abuse &quot;explanation&quot; are a crock.   big snip<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>best wishes<br/>\nJoel<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a wonderful gift possibility and to support a great cause check out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html\">http://www.naturalchild.com/calendar_pictures.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll children behave as well as they are treated.

Is it to decrease crime through deterrence? Punish<br/>\n&gt; for the sake of retribution? Protect the community? Make citizens feel safer<br/>\n&gt; even if they&#39;re not? I believe in locking up career criminals for as long as<br/>\n&gt; possible because they commit most of the crimes. Locking them up protects<br/>\n&gt; the community. Some career criminals can be identified as adolescents (but<br/>\n&gt; not many) so I&#39;d include such adolescents in this category of &quot;lock &#39;em up<br/>\n&gt; to protect society.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Incarceration does deter most citizens without an adult criminal history<br/>\n&gt; from committing felonies. But deternence only deters a minority of persons<br/>\n&gt; with a criminal history. In general, deterrence is much overrated by the<br/>\n&gt; general public because we want to believe that it works for others because<br/>\n&gt; it works for us. And gosh darn it if it doesn&#39;t work for them, lock &#39;em up<br/>\n&gt; anyway for their bad attitude!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do not believe in retribution. If one of our children hits the other<br/>\n&gt; without provocation, we don&#39;t encourage the recipient of the blow to seek<br/>\n&gt; retribution from his or her sibling (self-defense, yes, retribution, no).<br/>\n&gt; Are they held accountable? Of course. (I&#39;m talking about serious<br/>\n&gt; infractions, not typical sibling rivalry that is best dealt with in other<br/>\n&gt; ways). And, as Joel has discussed at the societal level, we try to encourage<br/>\n&gt; our children to understand the effect of their action and allow them to feel<br/>\n&gt; shame (note I&#39;m not saying &quot;shame them&quot; but &quot;allow them to feel shame&quot;). If<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s how we deal with children, why not with adults? (I&#39;m assuming others<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t encourage their children to seek retribution--is that accurate?).<br/>\n&gt; Again, I&#39;m not saying some criminals shouldn&#39;t be incarcerated. If the<br/>\n&gt; incarceration protects us, I&#39;m all for it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Rather than focusing on incarceration, we could lower the crime rate more<br/>\n&gt; effectively if we locked up fewer drug addicts, for example, and provide<br/>\n&gt; them with treatment that&#39;s always available (it also saves us at least $5<br/>\n&gt; for every $1 we spend on treatment). Or we could, as the International<br/>\n&gt; Chiefs of Police recently recommended, establish more afterschool programs<br/>\n&gt; for youth (the Chiefs supported this plan over hiring more police<br/>\n&gt; officers!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your civil response about an emotional issue.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best regards,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mark Worthen<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LifesLearn@...\">LifesLearn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 9:35 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] children charged with crimes poll<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LifesLearn@...\">LifesLearn@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mark-<br/>\n&gt; &gt;     If a child with a low IQ, who mentally is functioning at half his<br/>\n&gt; (her)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; age, does a crime, where are the parents?

Mind you, he was on probation when he<br/>\n&gt; went and robbed 10+ pizza drivers. They dropped that probation for the new<br/>\n&gt; charges!?!?!<br/>\n&gt;     Then there is the matter of the little school house killers, and I do not<br/>\n&gt; mean Columbine....These children live under 4 miles from my home. 4 boys<br/>\n&gt; plotted, listed, and obtained weapons to kill other children during a pep<br/>\n&gt; rally that would be held in the gym. They had a list of over 70 children,<br/>\n&gt; wrote each child&#39;s full name and where the child would sit... They also<br/>\n&gt; listed where they would place bombs, so that in a panic, no one could get<br/>\n&gt; away... Their trial started yesterday. 1 child was let go (he is testifying<br/>\n&gt; against the others) These 3 boys, 14, 14, and 13, are looking at life in<br/>\n&gt; prison. The mayor thinks that it is too harsh, for they ONLY planned it. It<br/>\n&gt; did not happen... Can you imagine if it did? this tragedy would be bigger<br/>\n&gt; than Columbine, and all the added problems that follow. This was not even a<br/>\n&gt; highschool, it was a middle school. Just in the aftermath of this event, Port<br/>\n&gt; Huron had numerous bomb threats, fights, and large scale violence. The county<br/>\n&gt; building closed due to a threat.<br/>\n&gt;     It is now policy for children, who even mention dismemberment of another<br/>\n&gt; child, to be suspended from school for no less than 1 day. My 7 yo, ADD son<br/>\n&gt; went to school after spending the morning playing Playstation, and told a<br/>\n&gt; little girl that he was going to shoot her, splatter blood all aver the wall.<br/>\n&gt; SUSPENDED! I think he deserved it. This child is a victim of joint custody,<br/>\n&gt; and his Dad is not the best role model... He is against me homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt;     Back to the point. If television is going to show the world decline and<br/>\n&gt; mark the consequences, then children know the before AND after of every<br/>\n&gt; wrongdoing. They know in real life that every action has a reaction, and<br/>\n&gt; every choice has a consequence. They choose to violate the law, they should<br/>\n&gt; be willing to suffer the penalty.

I have been<br/>\nthere when shrinks, social workers, lawyers and pastors have made speeches<br/>\nsimilar to:  &quot;I can&#39;t tell you what to say but . . . I had a client that<br/>\n(fill in the blank with your abuse of choice and then go into great detail<br/>\nof the hows, whys, wheres, etc. of the supposed abuse took place) and after<br/>\nthat was explained to the court/parole board, we got a new trial/shortened<br/>\nsentence/early parole.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my one rule to working with the client population I had was the truth<br/>\nso that I would know where to place them and what after services to set up.<br/>\n My experience in the gladiator schools was that over 90% (yes, NINETY %)<br/>\nwere not abused or molested!  My experience also shows that recitification<br/>\nis the norm even with rehab services!  And, I count recitification as<br/>\nrepeat criminals whether or not they get caught and the hard facts are that<br/>\nthe majority do repeat but simply don&#39;t get caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to IQ, are we suppose to make an exception because of IQ?  O.K.<br/>\nson, your IQ is low so we will turn you loose so you can do it again.  Been<br/>\nthere, seen that.  Young man with the IQ of a 9 yo was molesting little (4,<br/>\n5, 6 yo) girls.  The IQ excuse was used, he did &quot;rehab&quot; for 5 years and was<br/>\nturned loose.  Repeat, did 7 years in &quot;rehab&quot; psych unit and was turned<br/>\nloose.  Repeat.  Only this time he didn&#39;t get to do his &quot;rehab,&quot; the father<br/>\nof one of the little girls shot and killed him and is now doing time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, now as to my favorite.  And, again, I have extensive experience with<br/>\nthe shrink excuses having worked at an acute psych rehab unit for years,<br/>\nplease tell me exactly how you can determine if a person had a psychotic<br/>\nepisode at the time the crime was committed???  Because they tell you they<br/>\ndid???  Paaleeezzzz, like they aren&#39;t going to lie to get out of doing the<br/>\ntime!  And, again, we just turn them loose so they can have another<br/>\nsupposed psychotic episode and repeat the crime???<br/>\n<br/>\nThe numbers tell the true story, with the increase in the number of shrinks<br/>\nand social workers you have a following increase in the number of violent<br/>\ncrimes.  This is not a case of find a need and fill it, it is a case of<br/>\ncreate a need and fill it!  Pre-Freud and his let&#39;s use folks as drug<br/>\nguinea pigs, the per capita rate of violence among youthful offenders was<br/>\nextremely low as were the number of mass murderers and serial killers and<br/>\nteen suicides.  The operative words here being &quot;per capita.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTurning folks loose and telling them to take their meds does not work<br/>\nbecause it is against the law to &quot;force&quot; them to take their meds.  The ACLU<br/>\nhas had a hayday with that one in several cases, one of which they have<br/>\ntaken all the way to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, all these arguments re: youth vs. adult are moot, there are already<br/>\nlaws in place that cover those exact same &quot;excuses&quot; in adults, soooo what<br/>\nis the diff???  The only difference should be where they are placed, not<br/>\nwhat you get for the crimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAge, mental capacity and psych problems of the perp don&#39;t make the victim<br/>\nany less dead or raped or molested.  Somehow, we have gotten away from<br/>\nlooking at the victim as just that, the victim and looking at the perp as<br/>\nsome kind of victim.  My 7 yo can understand that if you aim a gun at<br/>\nsomeone and pull the trigger, you will kill that person.  So, maybe what we<br/>\nought to do is actually have a jury of peers (really peers) for all folks<br/>\ntried!  I think you might find that a jury of actual peers might have some<br/>\nreal surprises in store for kids who think they have a free age related<br/>\npass!<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Mark Worthen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mworthen@...\">mworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] children charged with crimes poll<br/>\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 11:55 PM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Mark Worthen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mworthen@...\">mworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lynda, et al:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;So, my vote is to make crime an equal opportunity punisher.&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Starting at what age, e.g., 16, 14, 12, 10?

I<br/>\nwant their entire lives to be dedicated to dealing with the terrible consequences of their actions.  I don&#39;t want them to<br/>\neven think for a moment that when they&#39;ve done &quot;the time&quot; that this compensates for their crime.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal Justice is a much harsher thing in many regards than our legalistic approach.  It allows people back into the community<br/>\nand it deals with the real underlying issues.  Forgiveness is the ultimate goal.  Forgiveness for offenses, even self<br/>\nforgiveness cannot undo the moral suffering which one has when one has committed offenses against someone else.  A person<br/>\nwith a full conscience lives with the consequences of their actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnony wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;Anony&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:primo@...\">primo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how much of this I missed but if we are all throwing our two cents in I guess I&#39;ll add mine.<br/>\n&gt; Wrong is wrong.

My nephew was a gang member. He robbed <br/>\npizza drivers at night with a small caliber hand gun. I think that he should <br/>\nhave been charged as an adult. At the age of 15, he knew just what he was <br/>\ndoing, and he knew the consequences. For all the money he stole, people he <br/>\nscared, and time he wasted, he received 90 days in a boot camp, 30 days in a <br/>\nhalfway house, and 1 year probation. Mind you, he was on probation when he <br/>\nwent and robbed 10+ pizza drivers. They dropped that probation for the new <br/>\ncharges!?!?!<br/>\n    Then there is the matter of the little school house killers, and I do not <br/>\nmean Columbine....These children live under 4 miles from my home. 4 boys <br/>\nplotted, listed, and obtained weapons to kill other children during a pep <br/>\nrally that would be held in the gym. They had a list of over 70 children, <br/>\nwrote each child&#39;s full name and where the child would sit... They also <br/>\nlisted where they would place bombs, so that in a panic, no one could get <br/>\naway... Their trial started yesterday. 1 child was let go (he is testifying <br/>\nagainst the others) These 3 boys, 14, 14, and 13, are looking at life in <br/>\nprison. The mayor thinks that it is too harsh, for they ONLY planned it. It <br/>\ndid not happen... Can you imagine if it did? this tragedy would be bigger <br/>\nthan Columbine, and all the added problems that follow. This was not even a <br/>\nhighschool, it was a middle school. Just in the aftermath of this event, Port <br/>\nHuron had numerous bomb threats, fights, and large scale violence. The county <br/>\nbuilding closed due to a threat. <br/>\n    It is now policy for children, who even mention dismemberment of another <br/>\nchild, to be suspended from school for no less than 1 day. My 7 yo, ADD son <br/>\nwent to school after spending the morning playing Playstation, and told a <br/>\nlittle girl that he was going to shoot her, splatter blood all aver the wall. <br/>\nSUSPENDED! I think he deserved it. This child is a victim of joint custody, <br/>\nand his Dad is not the best role model... He is against me homeschooling.<br/>\n    Back to the point. If television is going to show the world decline and <br/>\nmark the consequences, then children know the before AND after of every <br/>\nwrongdoing. They know in real life that every action has a reaction, and <br/>\nevery choice has a consequence. They choose to violate the law, they should <br/>\nbe willing to suffer the penalty.

What if he or she exhibits<br/>\n&gt; psychotic symptoms at the time of the offense?

In addition, some early adolescents with low<br/>\n&gt; IQ&#39;s are functioning at the level of 6 or 7 year olds.

Such a plan would retain the<br/>\n&gt; rehabilitative emphasis of the juvenile courts but still allow for extensive<br/>\n&gt; incarceration for the protection of society and retribution for the victims.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Finally, my biggest concern about focusing on lowering the age for trial as<br/>\n&gt; an adult is that the most effective approach to juvenile crime,<br/>\n&gt; *prevention*, gets lost in the discussion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Mark Worthen<br/>\n&gt; Charlotte, NC<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Lynda &lt;lurine@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &lt;Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 1:21 AM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] children charged with crimes poll<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;lurine@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We watched the trial of the 13 year old that killed a 16 yo when the 13 yo<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was 11.

Should the IQ of the juvenile<br/>\nmatter, e.g., should a 14 year old with an IQ of 70 be tried as an adult<br/>\njust as readily as a 14 year old with a 130 IQ? What if he or she exhibits<br/>\npsychotic symptoms at the time of the offense? Should children/teens who<br/>\nhave suffered severe and extensive sexual and/or physical abuse be tried as<br/>\nadults, and be subject to adult sentences, just as much as kids who haven&#39;t<br/>\nexpereinced such trauma?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m comfortable with 16 and 17 year olds being tried as adults (in North<br/>\nCarolina it&#39;s automatic) but when we start going below 16, we run the risk<br/>\nof incarcerating juveniles for decades who might be rehabilitated,<br/>\ncontribute to society, and, if the humanistic argument doesn&#39;t sway you,<br/>\nsave us all a ton of money. In addition, some early adolescents with low<br/>\nIQ&#39;s are functioning at the level of 6 or 7 year olds. Would we want to put<br/>\na 7 year old on trial as an adult and sentence him or her to 40 years in the<br/>\nstate prison?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those under-16 juveniles who pose a high risk of recidivism or who have<br/>\ncommitted heinous crimes (like the rape mentioned in a previous posting) I<br/>\nwould rather the juvenile/family courts retain jurisdiction over these<br/>\ndefendants indefinitely with the possibility of extended incarceration,<br/>\nintensive supervised probation, and/or mandantory treatment (depending on<br/>\nthe needs and willingness of the offender). Such a plan would retain the<br/>\nrehabilitative emphasis of the juvenile courts but still allow for extensive<br/>\nincarceration for the protection of society and retribution for the victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, my biggest concern about focusing on lowering the age for trial as<br/>\nan adult is that the most effective approach to juvenile crime,<br/>\n*prevention*, gets lost in the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Worthen<br/>\nCharlotte, NC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Lynda &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 1:21 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] children charged with crimes poll<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lurine@...\">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We watched the trial of the 13 year old that killed a 16 yo when the 13 yo<br/>\n&gt; was 11.
