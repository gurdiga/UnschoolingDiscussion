Unschooling, &quot;un-daycare-ing&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s the same thing.

Is this a co-incidence?   I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think the over institutionalization of the population along with the<br/>\n&gt;overly prolongued childhood is a lot to do with the current situation.<br/>\n&gt;  It came as a real surprise to me that even 50 years ago most<br/>\n&gt;Americans finished high school and that even then quite a large<br/>\n&gt;percentage went on to college.  What surprised me even more is<br/>\n&gt;that so many parents work so long and hard to pay to get their kids<br/>\n&gt;through college.  By the time a person is in college thay should be<br/>\n&gt;making their own way in life, but here so many of them are<br/>\n&gt;supported by Mommy and Daddy well into their 20&#39;s driving brand<br/>\n&gt;new cars that were graduation gifts, carrying a credit card so they<br/>\n&gt;can spend Mommy and Daddy&#39;s hard earned money when they<br/>\n&gt;should be earning their own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Way too may times I&#39;ve heard someone in their 20s refered to as<br/>\n&gt;&quot;just a kid&quot;....  people tend to rise [or sink] to other&#39;s expectations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Sue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The Winona Farm in Minnesota Welcomes Unschoolers All Year Round<br/>\n&gt;My website:      <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e\">http://members.xoom.com/sue_m_e</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm website:    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/\">http://members.xoom.com/winfarm/</a><br/>\n&gt;Farm newsletter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm\">http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/Winonafarm</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&quot;To believe in something, and not to live it,<br/>\n&gt;  is to be dishonest.&quot;   -Mahatma Gandhi<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Debra Caruso","from":"Debra Caruso &lt;mama@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"-pvVjW-lGoOEB_Sb5kiWDZY2ALFVtksQn_KeoE8e82p0zVogIalOKlvqlBLGJqv67YzCQiNn4usH7VXh-rqeo2CTKZE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] institutionalization of children","postDate":"962031533","msgId":9979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTc2RkFELjIyM0I3NDc1QGhvdmFjLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDAwNjI2MTMzMzQ4LjYyQ0NBQkVGRUBtYWlsLmludGVybHlueC5uZXQ+IDwzOTU3NjQ4Qy5BMjc2NkM3MEBpbnRlcmx5bngubmV0PiA8Mzk1NzY4N0UuOERBQjM4NEBob3ZhYy5jb20+IDwzOTU3NkI0NC5ENjk4RUJBOEBpbnRlcmx5bngubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":9977,"nextInTopic":9985,"prevInTime":9978,"nextInTime":9980,"topicId":9970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What a novel idea !!!Deb :)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-282711955\">What a novel idea !!!Deb :)<br/>\n<br/>\nD Klement wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Debra Caruso wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wholeheartedly agree.Our 4 sons have always had to help around the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; house,and sometimes painting with dad.I pay my 18 year old who is a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; senior to take digital pics for my business,and pay him for it.YOungest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; helps me with my business and pay him too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have tried to raise my boys to be self sufficient also.So far so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; good,We always told our sons if they wanted to go to college they would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; either have to get scholarships,aid,or pay themselves,we don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money for that.Son Daniel got a full ride for Engineering school in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; College,Thank God,it really took stress off of us.We help him out with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; money from time to time,but he has 2 jobs for the summer,and won&#39;t ask<br/>\n&gt; &gt; us for a thing.I don&#39;t have MS ,I have Fibromyalgia,and there are lots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ofdays I feel like I can&#39;t move....So any help is welcome :)deb<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gee, I&#39;m begining to think I should start an e-mail loop for<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling parents with auto immune/neurological disorders ;-)<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve come across about 10 parents with either fybro, lupus or MS.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Buzz (another Debbie)<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt;  The Klement Family       &quot;Education is what survives when<br/>\n&gt;  Darryl, Debbie,           what has been learned has been<br/>\n&gt;  Kathleen, Nathan &        forgotten&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  Samantha                  B.F.
