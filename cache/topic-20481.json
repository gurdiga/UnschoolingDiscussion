As for the h/s <br/>\nlaws...you have to contact the school district/superintendent&#39;s office of the <br/>\narea you&#39;re in and get the packet on homeschooling.  If you don&#39;t have a <br/>\nBachelor&#39;s degree or more, you have to file a quarterly report card with them <br/>\non subjects but you don&#39;t have to list any kind of curriculum or anything <br/>\nlike that.  They want you to have your kids tested once a year and that part <br/>\nkind of worried me but the h/s groups have names of private indviduals who <br/>\nadminister a test (there are different ones you can use) and it seemed pretty <br/>\nlaid back.  You are not required to show the school district those tests, <br/>\njust to have them done.<br/>\n     Get in touch with a support group there.  I have the name of someone in <br/>\nChaska who can give you more info about who to talk to...if you want it, <br/>\nemail me privately about it.<br/>\n     I really enjoyed living there.  There is a lot to do and the overall <br/>\natmosphere is tolerant and progressive.  And I&#39;m going there on Wed. to see <br/>\nmy sister&#39;s twin babies for the first time!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n        Lucy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20315,"nextTopicId":19974}}
