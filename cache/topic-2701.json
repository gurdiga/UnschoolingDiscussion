My name is D.J.<br/>\n(That is short for the Texan moniker of Donna Jean, but the only person<br/>\nto ever call me that was my mother when she was angry with me).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a homeschooling mother of 4.  I am very interested in how children<br/>\nlearn and facilitating that.  My experience has been that most people<br/>\nwant to meddle a lot with kids&#39; cognitive processes, thinking that it<br/>\nenhances learning.  One would hope they would infer that there is a<br/>\nreason in the radical drop in children&#39;s learning from age 5 on.<br/>\nChildren absorb a tremendous amount of information, completely<br/>\nuntutored, between the ages of 0 and 5.  The entire acquisition of<br/>\nlanguage usually takes place during that time, with absolutely NO formal<br/>\n<br/>\ninstruction whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some odd reason, our society seems to think 5 the perfect age to<br/>\nstart &quot;formal&quot; education, and, concomitantly, the learning drops off at<br/>\na plummeting rate once formal education is introduced.  Were kids&#39;<br/>\nbrains a money making venture, the idiot that employed that strategy<br/>\nwould have been fired long ago.  But, alas, they are only kids and its<br/>\nonly their brains -- so presumably, they&#39;ll get over it. (NOT!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if I sound a little cynical in my intro, but so few people<br/>\nunderstand how learning takes place.  Digesting what is encountered is<br/>\nat least as important as encountering it.  Play is how the child<br/>\nincorporates what he/she has learned into his/her own mental matrix.<br/>\nSo, providing kids with rich experiences and plenty of time to play and<br/>\ndigest what they are learning is an integral part of the learning scheme<br/>\n<br/>\nat our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I DO provide guidance.  I do not believe in an unmentored<br/>\nchild any more than I would recommend a child be raised by wolves.  Kids<br/>\n<br/>\nneed guidance, not interference.  Finding that balance is the<br/>\nresponsibility of parents.  We&#39;ve been through more, so we can offer<br/>\ninformation.  Of course, one can argue when guidance digresses to<br/>\ninterference, but that is pretty much up to each parent and child to<br/>\nfigure out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI homeschool my kids and other people&#39;s kids at my house.  We always<br/>\nhave a houseful.  It is always pretty insane here.  This weekend we had<br/>\n10 kids here.  My daughter, age 14, just left for Korea.  For 2 years,<br/>\nshe had been asking for us to let her apply for a special foreign<br/>\nexchange program through our church, and my husband and I sat on it.<br/>\nFinally, we let her apply and she was accepted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old dyslexic son loves physics and algebra.  He can read a<br/>\nbook upside down as easily as right side up.  He is a cute, nerdy,<br/>\nfreckle faced boy.  My 10 year old sprite of a daughter is a gifted<br/>\nactress.  My 5 year old son is undoubtedly the cutest boy on earth.  (In<br/>\n<br/>\nNO way do I claim to be unbiased in my assessment of my children.  Hell,<br/>\n<br/>\nthey are my kids.  You want unbiased, go read a statistician&#39;s report<br/>\n(which may or may not be unbiased but sure will be boring).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for myself, I am a journalist and a computer graphic design artist.<br/>\nFirst and foremost, I am mother to my kids, and any other kids that<br/>\nhappen to be at my house.  I have friends that are absolutely &quot;radical<br/>\nunschoolers.&quot;  I know specifically what that means.  I am not at all<br/>\nsure that I fit that category, but my ideas sure DO NOT fit any other<br/>\nphilosophy.  The term &quot;eclectic&quot; is too wishy-washy for my taste.  I<br/>\nHATE &quot;structured.&quot;  I equate that with &quot;anal retentive.&quot;  I am<br/>\ndefinitely &quot;relaxed&quot; (except, of course, when I am &quot;stressed out!&quot;)<br/>\nMy husband and I are both self taught people.  We know what it takes to<br/>\nlearn, since we ourselves had no teachers for the professions that we<br/>\nrespectively acquired.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is an adventure through which one learns.  Work is an excellent<br/>\ntutor.  Our kids definitely know how to live life to the fullest and how<br/>\n<br/>\nto work! (No maid service here.  When its time to clean the bathrooms,<br/>\ndo yard work, fold clothes, wash dishes, etc., like it or not, we ALL<br/>\nclean &#39;em.  Some things jes&#39; AIN&#39;T an option!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very sorry if I appear pedantic.  An intro was suggested to me, so<br/>\nI deigned to offer one.  I am happily argumentative and Irish.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to meet everyone<br/>\nDJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------- ONElist Sponsor ----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nATTENTION ONElist MEMBERS:  Get your ONElist news!<br/>\nJoin our MEMBER NEWSLETTER here:<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2\">http://clickme.onelist.com/ad/newsletter2</a> &quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;Alternative Learning Foundation&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alternative-learning.org\">http://www.alternative-learning.org</a><br/>\nto access associated Web-sites</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2706,"nextTopicId":2711}}
