I still had an &quot;agenda.&quot;  I still knew what I wanted <br/>\nmy children to learn, and ideas about how I wanted them to learn it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that I was &quot;unschooling&quot; because I did not use store-bought <br/>\ncurricula, or &quot;lesson plans,&quot; or a structured schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was not &quot;unschooling.&quot;  (Nor am I &quot;unschooling&quot; at this point in time <br/>\neither, I don&#39;t think.)  But I am exploring unschooling and the concepts <br/>\nunderlying unschooling, and  I believe that unschooling can and does work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI almost unsubscribed from the list as a result of perceived personal <br/>\n&quot;attacks&quot; on myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad that I did not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad that I &quot;hung in&quot; there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that the more I understand of unschooling, the more I understand <br/>\nthe reason that tempers flare on this list.  On the one hand, this list <br/>\ncomprises many devout, dedicated, and longtime unschoolers.  Those <br/>\nindividuals belonging to that &quot;group&quot; have the benefit of experience, and, I <br/>\nthink, are being supportive when they call attention to the use of <br/>\n&quot;schoolish&quot; words, like &quot;lessons,&quot; &quot;required reading,&quot; or other such <br/>\nbuzzwords.  Orwell, I think, said &quot;Who controls language, controls thought.&quot;  <br/>\nWords are key in creating perception and understanding.  Only when these <br/>\nbuzzwords were called to my attention (as a result of my own prior posts) did <br/>\nit dawn on me that what I thought was unschooling was not, in fact, <br/>\nunschooling.  It was &quot;homeschooling without a lesson plan.&quot;  I was properly <br/>\nlabeled (yuck) an &quot;eclectic homeschooler.&quot;  And, though I am not happy to be <br/>\nlabeled, I can think of worse labels than that!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, we have people who approach this list with their own <br/>\nperception of what unschooling is, and woe unto them if they use the <br/>\nbuzzwords and do not understand that the acrimony directed at the use of the <br/>\nbuzzwords is NOT directed at the user of the buzzwords.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all rebellious here.  Were we not, we would be conforming with the <br/>\nsocietal standards of education and shooing our children off to public school <br/>\nfive days a week.  We all are outspoken.  We all are intelligent.  We all are <br/>\nopen-minded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we all want to be right.  (Okay, I&#39;m speaking only for myself here, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I am so very different from anyone else -- I mean, does anyone <br/>\nreally WANT to be wrong?!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any event, it is truly understandable that the newbies&#39; diction elicits <br/>\nsome corrective diction from the oldies, which, in turn, gives rise to <br/>\ndefensiveness, hostility, and impassioned diction from all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t happen to mind any of it anymore.
