I glazed over.   <br/>\nBut I had never seen or heard of it, so I bring it here for those of  <br/>\nyou for whom numbers and rules about them sound fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eluzions.com/Games/Paper/\">http://eluzions.com/Games/Paper/</a><br/>\nThere are some pencil-and-paper games in general.  Sprout looks  <br/>\ngood.  It has numbers, but only one rule. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who prefer games based on words and letters, two easy things:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funbrain.com/roots/index.html\">http://www.funbrain.com/roots/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funbrain.com/hangman/index.html\">http://www.funbrain.com/hangman/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Holly was alphabetizing her favorite movies for MyPage, and  <br/>\n&quot;showed me her work.&quot;  We talked about oddities of alphabetizing, how  <br/>\nphone books put all the capitalized things together, like radio and  <br/>\nTV stations, rather than interspersed, and about it being a little  <br/>\nvariable.  The video store puts numeric names before A; the phone  <br/>\nbook doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here&#39;s something I sent her from the games googling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: February 6, 2006 5:54:13 AM MST<br/>\n&gt; To: Holly Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:blazing_orange@...\">blazing_orange@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: alphabet dot-to-dot<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funbrain.com/dots/index.html\">http://www.funbrain.com/dots/index.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The ones on the right side are alphabets, and I thought of your  <br/>\n&gt; alphabetical order, because one of them skips some letters!  That&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; cool!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There are lots of games on that site, if you click whatever box is  <br/>\n&gt; at the bottom, but I thought these were cool.  Some online dot-to- <br/>\n&gt; dot games are irritating, but this one&#39;s easy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":111766,"nextTopicId":111759}}
