The following can be found at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.paul-revere.org/pr/holgate/ar990701.shtml\">http://www.paul-revere.org/pr/holgate/ar990701.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nExpanding School-Based Health Clinics: A Bad Idea<br/>\n<br/>\nby Karen Holgate, President, PNN<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn�t that long ago that opponents fought against establishing health<br/>\nclinics on school campuses. These opponents argued that once clinics were<br/>\nestablished, clinic supporters would not be content with offering limited<br/>\nservices to the poor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey argued that like all government entities clinics would seek to expand<br/>\nservices and encourage greater dependence on the services offered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose early opponents were right. Many states, and now some members of<br/>\nCongress, believe school-based health clinics should offer not only<br/>\n&quot;comprehensive&quot; primary health care, but also include a full range of mental<br/>\nhealth services.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn California, AB 1363 (Davis, D-SD), is making its way through the<br/>\nlegislature. This bill seeks to drastically alter and expand the scope of<br/>\nservices offered by school health centers. The original version of this bill<br/>\n&quot;required&quot; school boards to provide &quot;school-based health centers as<br/>\ntraditional and safety net providers.&quot; The amended version altered this<br/>\nmandate by saying:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This bill would �authorize� the board to include school-based health<br/>\ncenters<br/>\nas traditional and safety net providers that �meet certain requirements.�&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(Reality: schools that now have centers will be greatly expanding services;<br/>\nthose that don�t have clinics will be implementing them. If some school<br/>\nboards try to hold-out, you can be sure they will be pressured into<br/>\nimplementing these full-service clinics.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB 1363 will include comprehensive primary medical and mental health,<br/>\nincluding:<br/>\n<br/>\nPrescribing and dispensing &quot;prescriptions&quot; (drugs)<br/>\n<br/>\nCounseling�individual, group and family<br/>\n<br/>\nExaminations<br/>\n<br/>\nMental health assessment<br/>\n<br/>\nReproductive services that will include:<br/>\n<br/>\npelvic exams<br/>\n<br/>\ninformation on sex<br/>\n<br/>\ndiagnosis and treatment<br/>\n<br/>\nprescribing, dispensing and referrals for birth control, &quot;including condoms&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSubstance abuse treatment<br/>\n<br/>\nWeight control<br/>\n<br/>\nAcne<br/>\n<br/>\nYou name it; the proposed new clinics will cover it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavis� bill continues by saying that these clinics must be &quot;easily<br/>\naccessible&quot; and must be open during classroom hours as well as limited<br/>\nbefore<br/>\nand after school hours. It says that local providers will decide their own<br/>\n&quot;parental consent policy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a parent, does that give you a warm and fuzzy feeling that you will have<br/>\ncontrol over your child�s health? Do you feel confident that your school<br/>\nwill<br/>\nprotect your rights? Do you believe your child�s school should be allowed to<br/>\ndetermine the extent of your participation in, and &quot;parental consent&quot; of,<br/>\nyour own child�s basic health needs? AB 1363 mandates that clinics &quot;shall&quot;<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&quot;user-friendly&quot; (for students), &quot;private,&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; and should<br/>\ninvolve parents as is &quot;age appropriate&quot; for the student AND only with the<br/>\nstudent�s consent.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Do you still feel in control?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB 1363 continues by saying that the clinics are to &quot;encourage&quot; students to<br/>\nuse them. It makes it clear that the clinics will recognize the rights of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nchild (not the parents). Children will be able to participate in the<br/>\n&quot;decisionmaking&quot; process for their own health care (not parents). The bill<br/>\nrepeatedly reiterates the students� need for privacy; it then states that<br/>\nstudents &quot;shall be&quot; provided with a written statement about the hours and<br/>\nservices offered by the clinic. (not parents). Of course the bill mandates<br/>\nthat extensive data will be collected on each child. This &quot;consistent and<br/>\ncomplete&quot; data is to include, but not be limited to:<br/>\n<br/>\nname and ID number,<br/>\n<br/>\npersonal and biographical information,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;all significant illness and medical conditions �shall� be on a problem<br/>\nlist,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;�use of cigarette, alcohol, illegal substances, or other high-risk<br/>\nbehaviors<br/>\n�as determined by each school health center,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n�history and physical examination records shall document �appropriate<br/>\nSUBJECTIVE and objective information,&quot; etc., etc., etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, students�not parents�are given the right to approve or<br/>\ndisapprove of the release of their records.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not just a California phenomenon. In Minnesota, Dr. Karen Effrem,<br/>\nMD,<br/>\nsays that school-based clinics allow mental health screening, tracking, and<br/>\nreferrals without parental knowledge or consent. She says that parents<br/>\nand/or<br/>\nthe parents� insurance is often billed for these services�again without<br/>\nparental permission or even review of records.  Dr. Effrem points out that<br/>\nthe guidelines for diagnosing mental health are extremely broad and vague.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis mounting absurdity is not just occurring within individual states;<br/>\nCongress has entered into the debate. Some members now believe that using<br/>\nschool-based health centers to treat &quot;depression&quot; in children will help<br/>\nreduce the chances of another Littleton disaster.[1]  Before engaging in<br/>\nfeel<br/>\ngood &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reactions to the Littleton tragedy; or before authorizing<br/>\nmassive expansion of school-based mental health services, issues of privacy,<br/>\nconfidentiality, parental rights, funding, and the proper role of government<br/>\n(and public schools) in the lives of citizens must be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychological evaluations are already being conducted on children in<br/>\nclassrooms across America�often without parental notification or permission.<br/>\nTeachers often administer surveys that ask children whether their parents<br/>\ntreat &quot;other children&quot; in the family better than they treat them, whether<br/>\ntheir parents are headed for a divorce, about their personal use of alcohol,<br/>\ndrugs or other substances, about their thoughts, feelings and attitudes,<br/>\nabout how they feel about mom and dad, etc. Most of these surveys are given<br/>\nwithout parent notification or permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes teachers (not trained psychologists) are asked to evaluate<br/>\nstudents. A  survey given to third grade teachers in Ohio [2] asks teachers<br/>\nto subjectively measure and record students� behaviors. Some of these<br/>\nquestions ask the teacher to judge whether the student<br/>\n<br/>\n1) &quot;appropriately questions rules that may be fair,<br/>\n<br/>\n2) appropriately tells you when he or she thinks you have treated him or her<br/>\nunfairly,<br/>\n<br/>\n3) gets along with people who are different,<br/>\n<br/>\n4) fidgets or moves excessively, disturbs ongoing activities,<br/>\n<br/>\n5) has low self-esteem,<br/>\n<br/>\n6) appears lonely,<br/>\n<br/>\n7) gives compliments to peers�&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice the subjective nature of the questions. Who determines what is<br/>\n&quot;appropriate&quot;? What does it mean to &quot;fidget or move excessively&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n(We�re talking 3rd graders!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child doesn�t give enough compliments to his/her peers, does that<br/>\nmean your child is not normal? In this particular survey teachers are<br/>\nactually instructed that if they don�t observe one of the behaviors listed<br/>\nthey are to &quot;estimate&quot; what they think the child would do.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine the scope of subjective evaluations of your child�s &quot;mental<br/>\nhealth&quot; if school-based health clinics decide they can and should start<br/>\nscreening every child for potential &quot;mental health&quot; problems? The<br/>\nopportunity<br/>\nfor wide-scale abuse is staggering. Parents are already complaining about<br/>\nthe<br/>\nabuse of current school practices. For example:<br/>\n<br/>\nTwelve 3rd graders were sent to the school psychologist. After being asked<br/>\nnumerous personal questions about their families, the children were told not<br/>\nto talk to anyone outside the classroom about the &quot;counseling group.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nParents who gave permission for an educational aptitude test for their 4th<br/>\ngrade twin daughters were shocked when the girls told them they were grilled<br/>\nabout possible sexual abuse and whether their parents yelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nA single mom learned her 7th grade son had been seeing a school psychologist<br/>\nfor six weeks. The school labeled him at-risk because she was divorced. In<br/>\nthe note, her son told her he hadn�t realized he was such a &quot;burden&quot; until<br/>\nthe counselor told him. She found him several hours later wandering the<br/>\nstreets in the dark�crying.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurriculum that teaches elementary students that &quot;any form of punishment or<br/>\npermissiveness is disrespectful and discouraging to children&quot; and then asks<br/>\nyoung children to share times when they have been punished.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find it hard to believe that this can happen, consider the following:<br/>\nIn California, current law requires that parents be notified at the<br/>\nbeginning<br/>\nof each year that they have the right to be told they have no rights�that<br/>\ntheir child may be removed from campus for &quot;confidential medical services&quot;<br/>\nwithout their consent.[3]<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to the concerns over parental rights, concerns over the growing<br/>\ncost to maintain these clinics should be considered. For instance, while AB<br/>\n1363 is gaining legislative support, [4]  SB 468, [5]  will change current<br/>\nCalifornia law and allow mental health parity insurance coverage. For<br/>\nparents<br/>\nof school-age children, this means that SB 468 will allow their insurance to<br/>\nbe used to pay for mental health services administered by the school-based<br/>\nhealth clinics. All too often these services will be administered, and<br/>\npayment made, without parental knowledge, consent or involvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the cost doesn�t stop there. Another bill, AB 920, was also introduced<br/>\nthis year. Designed to provide $35,000,000 in &quot;seed&quot; money to kick-off the<br/>\nimplementation of these centers, the bill didn�t make it out of committee<br/>\nthis year. However, a call to the author�s office verified that the bill<br/>\nwill<br/>\nresurface in January, 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cost to the taxpayer doesn�t stop at &quot;seed money&quot;. Pennsylvania State<br/>\nRepresentative Sam Rohrer has strong words about the cost of this movement<br/>\nto<br/>\ninstall comprehensive health care into our school system. Rep. Rohrer says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What is involved in the �Medicalization of the Schools�? At issue is<br/>\nMedicaid. Once the government sponsored health insurance program for the<br/>\npoor, Medicaid has now moved mainstream into our schools. It is paying<br/>\nsalaries, funding multiple programs that boldly intrude into the sanctity of<br/>\nthe home, and is the cause of escalating federal and state budgets. If this<br/>\nweren�t objectionable enough, the Medicaid component is but one spoke on the<br/>\nwheel of the larger societal restructuring movement that clearly<br/>\norchestrates<br/>\na number of large federal entitlement programs to produce what the Clinton<br/>\nadministration calls a �safety net�.&quot; [6]<br/>\n<br/>\nRep. Rohrer is right. The burden of supporting the &quot;medicalization&quot; of<br/>\nschools will fall on the taxpayer. Health care doesn�t come cheap. And at a<br/>\ntime when many families and older Americans can�t afford decent health care,<br/>\nthe government now wants to use highly questionable tactics to create a<br/>\nmassive bureaucracy that will violate the sanctity of the family and drain<br/>\nAmerica�s workers of personal income. Taxpayers will be paying higher taxes<br/>\nand increased insurance premiums to cover the costs of a government run, and<br/>\nstaffed, comprehensive, full-service health care system in schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than enact legislation that would lower taxes and insurance premiums,<br/>\nthus making it easier for America�s families, and seniors, to afford medical<br/>\ncare, the government�s answer is to force Americans into paying increased<br/>\ntaxes and premiums thus forcing more and more of them to rely on the<br/>\ngovernment to provide these services.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is nothing more than Hillary Clinton�s original�and failed�health plan<br/>\nnow being implemented in schools across the country. It is the fulfillment<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe &quot;village school&quot; concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a &quot;village school?&quot; In 1996, Pomona, California established an<br/>\n&quot;Education Village at Plaza Azteca.&quot; This new &quot;village school&quot; includes &quot;a<br/>\nseamless flow of services from preschool to university,&quot; [7] health services<br/>\nfor students and their families, and a full range of services that includes<br/>\nsocial and family support systems. &quot;Village schools&quot; allow the<br/>\ncentralization<br/>\nof government services. They have a captive audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the opening ceremony of Pomona�s &quot;village,&quot; Superintendent Patrick Leier<br/>\nsaid that he expected the new facility to cost $10 million. He said the<br/>\ndistrict had budgeted $5 million and anticipated an additional $4 to $5<br/>\nmillion from the state in matching funds. This, of course, is just the<br/>\nbeginning. Initial costs pale in relation to ongoing operational expenses.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpanding school-based health clinic services to include mental health and<br/>\n&quot;comprehensive primary health care&quot; for students is nothing more than a<br/>\nblatant attempt to wrest control away from parents and place the<br/>\ndecisionmaking for their child�s health in the hands of the state run health<br/>\ncenter. Clinic employees will decide what services are needed; whether a<br/>\nchild is &quot;depressed&quot; and whether a child needs a pelvic examination,<br/>\nmedication, etc. And remember, the parent is NOT considered a necessity in<br/>\nthis process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are already ample procedures and agencies in place to aid children and<br/>\nparents�whether the problem be mental or physical.  Expanding school-based<br/>\nhealth centers and their services  are totally unnecessary. The cost is<br/>\nprohibitive and the potential for abuse far outweighs any imagined benefits.<br/>\nIncreasing government intrusion into the private lives of families is<br/>\nsomething that should be taken very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n###<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: To find out what you can do to fight AB 1363 and SB 468, contact<br/>\nParents National Network.<br/>\n<br/>\nFootnotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.
