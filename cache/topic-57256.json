So a tech school <br/>\ndegree can be very limited to just what you need to be a welder or a <br/>\nglassblower of scientific tubes and special beakers, or a repairer of one <br/>\nparticular brand of cash register.  But a neurosurgeon has a university <br/>\ndegree, and in the U.S. that&#39;s probably going to mean English literature.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to UNM I slid through in a lax season (following the Viet Nam war <br/>\nprotests in which a student was bayonetted by the national guard and many <br/>\nwere tear gassed, and the semester ended abruptly a week before finals), and <br/>\nwasn&#39;t required to take a foreign language nor math.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe requirements were raised the year after I left.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have &#39;college lite&#39; (though I had enough credits for three full minors, <br/>\nso it wasn&#39;t numbers, it was hoops-not-jumped).<br/>\n<br/>\nBrits are different.  They think they invented it or something.  (But I think <br/>\nprobably the French beat them to it &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57012,"nextTopicId":57017}}
