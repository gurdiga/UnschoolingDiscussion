Although I <br/>\nthink TV is good, that is another subject. I do agree with Marc when he talks <br/>\nabout giving children, who have energy for three, lots of opportunity for <br/>\nexpending it. When Jack was three, we were having a terrible time with him. <br/>\nHe was always goooing! (at the time, I didn&#39;t realize that this is just how <br/>\nboys are.) At his regular check up I spoke to his doctor about this, and he <br/>\n(without talking to or observing Jack for any length of time.) wrote a script <br/>\nfor Adderall 5mg 1 tab each morning and 1 at noon (for ADHD) and another <br/>\nscript for Clonidine 0.1mg 1 tab each evening before bed (an *adult <br/>\nmedication* that relaxes and dilates blood vessels resulting in lowered blood <br/>\npressure. Treating hypertension.) so Jack could relax and sleep! <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved Jack&#39;s doctor, his dad was my pediatrician, his brother is my regular <br/>\ndoctor and is married to my cousin. So before this and another incident six <br/>\nmonths later involving a severe case of appendicitis misdiagnosed as a bad <br/>\ncase of the flu, I never questioned him! (resulting in Darin and I being <br/>\nquestioned at the hospital, in the middle of the night, about whether or not <br/>\nwe were child abusers! If we hadn&#39;t brought him in when we did, he would have <br/>\ndied in a few hours. AND he almost died on the OR table and twice in the next <br/>\ntwo days. He stayed for 18 days and had to have another operation 5 days <br/>\nlater to remove 6 inches of bowel that became infected.) We kept Jack on <br/>\nthese meds for two months. During that time he became withdrawn, developed a <br/>\nfacial tic, constantly licked his lips and his hands shook. It broke my heart <br/>\nto see my baby like this, but I trusted the doctor. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am not saying that there is no such thing as ADD/ADHD, but I do believe <br/>\nthat giving the child the freedom to learn while standing up and walking <br/>\naround (whatever helps) is best. I also believe that activity was/is the <br/>\nanswer to all of Jacks energy. During the day, we go to swimming lessons and <br/>\nplay at our park for at least two hours in the afternoon. The kids take their <br/>\nbikes out every day too. Each evening when Darin gets home, he and Jack go <br/>\noutside and clean up the yard, wrestle around and walk the dogs. Both kids <br/>\nalso have evening and Saturday ballgames two or three times a week. (in the <br/>\nspring and summer) When they go visit their grandparents in Oklahoma, my Mom <br/>\nkeeps them busy too. She takes them to the OKC zoo, to the omni-plex and the <br/>\nhands on science museum. They have bikes at her house and they ride all over. <br/>\nMy Dad takes them walking on the nature trails with his dog, fishing, and <br/>\nteaches them gun safety. The little boy who I used to be at my wits end with, <br/>\nnow sleeps peacefully all night and isn&#39;t bouncing off the walls all day. He <br/>\ncan sit for a story and *most of the time* helps around the house. <br/>\nIronically, when he went to school this past year, he showed no signs of <br/>\nADD/ADHD. His teacher said he sat still during lessons, played nice... All <br/>\nthe things that are revered in public school. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I know there are children who have ADD/ADHD, I seriously doubt that <br/>\nJack ever had it. I believe that if his doctor had taken the time to visit <br/>\nwith Jack, he would have (maybe?) told me I was overreacting. I also believe <br/>\nthat if I had taken the time to read about, and talk to other parents with <br/>\nchildren diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, I would have seen that Jack didn&#39;t fit the <br/>\npicture.<br/>\n<br/>\nLessons learned with children are often the hardest. In some ways I am glad <br/>\nthis all happened, it gives me empathy with those who struggle with this <br/>\nevery day. It also opened my eyes regarding my own needs as a parent. I <br/>\nreally loosened up after all was said and done. This is when I learned that <br/>\nif something isn&#39;t going to matter in 10 minutes, then it just isn&#39;t worth <br/>\nworrying about at all.<br/>\nJust my 15 cents. ~Nancy<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112723896,"authorName":"AprilWells","from":"AprilWells &lt;dawnwells@...&gt;","profile":"dawnwellsttc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Just Say No To Drugs","postDate":"1023389905","msgId":38207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDRkZCMEQxLjkwMjA5MDRAY294Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDMuMC41LjMyLjIwMDIwNjA2MTQyNDQyLjAwZDAzN2QwQG1haWwucGxhbmV0Y29tbS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":38206,"nextInTopic":38210,"prevInTime":38206,"nextInTime":38208,"topicId":38206,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"WELL SAID!!
