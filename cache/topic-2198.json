He looked at me like he thought I&#39;d lost my mind!<br/>\n<br/>\nPhew - safe for another year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure there are &quot;good&quot; schools - our school district is excellant - if you<br/>\nhave to be in school - Hmm, some of my best friends are Public Schoolers.<br/>\n(in fact my best friend IS on the school board)<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO homeschooling is best, however I know I&#39;m not going to be able to<br/>\nconvince everyone (anyone?) of that, so I don&#39;t try.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt breaks my heart to see my bright &quot;gifted&quot; 14 yo niece, who loved school<br/>\nher first 5 years, and now hates it.  They have nothing to offer her!  And<br/>\nanother friend just told me her 10 yo is ready to go back to school because<br/>\nhe&#39;s so bored, and I know he&#39;s just hit that hump in the road of<br/>\ndeschooling - maybe that&#39;s why school vacation is so short - so the kids<br/>\nwon&#39;t have time to figure out that they don&#39;t need someone else to tell them<br/>\nwhat to do every minute of the day?  So lets all hear it for year round<br/>\nschool!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if my kids wanted to go to school, I&#39;d let them.  I&#39;ve heard that school<br/>\nfeels a whole lot different when you are there by your own choice - and when<br/>\nyou know that you can always go home again!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy $.02!<br/>\nBecky in Ohio</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2197,"nextTopicId":2217}}
