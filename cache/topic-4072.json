We send our <br/>\nchildren to Awana on Tuesday nights. Tonight, they called to tell us that our <br/>\nyoungest, Tiffany, was upset and we should come and get her. We left the <br/>\nhouse in a rush (Tiffany has Selective Mutism and she is very insecure. When <br/>\nwe hear she is upset, we go now!) and left the door unlocked. We went and got <br/>\nall the children and picked up McDonald&#39;s on the way home. We saw that the <br/>\nfront screen door was open, and thought that it was odd, but not much... So <br/>\nwe came in and ate. Ron, my dh, went into our bedroom to take a pain <br/>\nreliever, and this is where everything changed. ALL OF OUR MEDICATIONS ARE <br/>\nGONE! All of Ron&#39;s pain relievers for the car accident. I am asking for <br/>\nprayers for both my family and whoever has the meds. That they do not <br/>\noverdose, and that we are ok with how our life goes. We are on a fixed <br/>\nincome, so we are not able to refill the meds until our insurance picks them <br/>\nup again. I am so frustrated. I am at wit&#39;s end with this town. I know that <br/>\nGod is good, and that he will make everything right. It is just the horrible <br/>\nfeeling of being violated. Mentally. The officer is here, I need to go. <br/>\nThanks for letting me vent, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nTeacher and Mommy of 4 homeschooling fanatics, wife to the best principal, <br/>\nprotector of many pets and wild ones, and unpublished writer.<br/>\n<br/>\n       I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>\n       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>\n    Believe in others, and be a part; believe in yourself, and be the lead. s.<br/>\n            ***Life&#39;s Learnings Academy - Protecting Our Children***<br/>\n        IT&#39;S GREAT TO LEARN WHERE THE PRINCIPAL LOVES YOU<br/>\n                           ICQ: 43428000     aol IM: Lifeslearn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4071,"nextTopicId":4077}}
