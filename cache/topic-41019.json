Parents seem to have a hard time blieving that she learned to swim by going with me to the pool and being in the water. It&#39;s odd how things have turned around so. My parents <br/>\n  would never have thought to put me in swim lessons. That was what my older brothers were there for, to show me how to swim. ;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m thinking 9 is a good age for swimming lessons :-) Rain already knew how to dog paddle around, and float, and have tea parties on the bottom of the pool, and stuff like that, just from being in the water all the time... but she wanted to learn to swim actual strokes, and I wasn&#39;t doing very well at showing her (maybe because I&#39;m not very good at it). So she&#39;s been having private lessons with an 18 yr old former hser and current college sophomore, and it&#39;s been wonderful. They talk about what she wants to learn, he knows swimming inside and out and can break every skill down into the tiniest parts, if need be. He knows all sorts of little tricks to help her refine the techniques. She enjoys it a lot, and he&#39;s talked about how much faster she learns than the 5 yr olds he teaches - probably mostly because she&#39;s not 5. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I also think she would have been fine paddling around the rest  of her life, she didn&#39;t *need* to know the freestyle and the backstroke and the breastroke. But she wanted to, and I didn&#39;t know them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m thinking of signing her up for singing lessons for the same reason- she wants to know stuff that I don&#39;t know (she told me I sing alto, which was news to me) and learning something like that from an actual person sounds much easier than trying to do it from a book.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
