They could be out to supper or visiting a friend or at the park, <br/>\nbut the punishment gets to wait until they get home. It doesn&#39;t matter how <br/>\ngood they are after that---they DESERVE to be punished. The boys get to <br/>\n&quot;decide&quot; how severe the punishment should be---how many licks with the <br/>\npaddle---now that they are &quot;old enough&quot; to make those decisions, of course! <br/>\n(&#39;though I&#39;m sure that if they decide not to be severe ENOUGH, the punishment <br/>\ncould be even harsher!)  When they get home, they &quot;march&quot; upstairs, pull down <br/>\ntheir pants, and take the lickin&#39; like little soldiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir parents also feel that punishments should not be given in the heat of <br/>\nanger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably a good idea because if that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do in cold <br/>\nblood---can you imagine what the parents are capable of in the heat of the <br/>\nmoment???<br/>\n<br/>\nSick.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45086,"nextTopicId":45101}}
