I have never seen an unschooled child<br/>\n(and rarely a schooled child) who has an &#39;inclination to be inert&#39;. This<br/>\ndescription would only apply to a child who had had all initiative beaten out of<br/>\nthem (literally or figuratively) by adults. Non-action is not necessarily<br/>\ninertness or laziness. Some people are thinkers, and some take a lot longer to<br/>\nget through thinking. I don&#39;t believe it is possible to know what is happenning<br/>\ninside someone else&#39;s head. You ask a kid &#39;what are you thinking about?&#39; and<br/>\ns/he answers &#39;nothing&#39;, you may think s/he is being lazy or inert, I would<br/>\nassume that they didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, a &#39;bored&#39; child left alone to be bored (still talk to them but<br/>\ndon&#39;t nag), trusted to come through, will eventually burst forth in activity and<br/>\ncreativity, often into a totally new interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO it is, yet again, a matter of trusting our children - and being able to keep<br/>\ntrusting, sometimes for a looong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8226,"nextTopicId":8199}}
