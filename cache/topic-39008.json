Instead of trying to understand the situation<br/>\nthrough his reporting it might be better to sit in on the Sunday school<br/>\nclass and watch how your son is behaving.<br/>\n        I think this was a very valuable suggestion, and I took it this week.  The teacher had them outside on the grass, so I sat behind a tree where I couldn&#39;t be seen, and observed.  I saw that the girls were a tight little group who whispered and giggled and looked at my son, then whispered and giggled some more.  He sat with head bowed, trying to ignore them.  The teacher tried to get them discussing the Good Samaritan, and the girls answered some of the questions, but often strayed onto what movie they had seen the night before and who was going to be allowed at the sleepover.  Ds wandered to the edge of the creek, and picked up a stone (he has a rock collection at home he is constantly adding to).  The girls responded by giggling, and shrieking &quot;Don&#39;t throw that at us&quot;.  Instead, he threw them a dirty look.  Several times ds growled &quot;I wish you guys would be quiet&quot; without making eye contact with anyone.  I finally got up and went away.  Yes, it obvious ds needs to bone up his peer interaction skills in terms of lightening up a little and maybe making a wise crack instead of glaring.  He probably could use a reminder that he can&#39;t control their behavior, any more than I can control his.  But the Unabomber?  No, he just needs another guy to sit beside and draw off some of the fire.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; IF your son is going so far as to<br/>\n </span></blockquote>chide the other children about their immature behavior, that sounds like<br/>\nit could cause ongoing social interaction problems.  <br/>\n    This is, unfortunately, true.  Of course the other kids are not going to respond positively to being growled and glared at.  I can tell he is doing it out of frustration, though.  Anybody know a nice, pre-packaged curriculum that teaches how to interact with your peers?

I still had hang-ups. I wanted to use punishment effectively, I <br/>\n  wanted everyone to do their chores with smiles on their faces, I expected <br/>\n  many things to be the way I wanted them to be.<br/>\n    Oh, Nancy -- this is something I&#39;m really trying to grip myself!  Granted, we have only been unschooling for a very short while, but the more we do, the more dh relaxes, and the better things flow (I&#39;m the one whose dh really wanted a school-at-home atmosphere). But I&#39;m still running into all kinds of unexpected snags, even though I am a staunch supporter of all the things you&#39;ve mentioned above.  I am continually berating myself for not unschooling properly!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">    &gt;&gt;Coming here has given me a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  peek at the bigger picture. You can&#39;t just unschool when it comes to <br/>\n  *schoolish* things. You can&#39;t turn unschooling off at the end of the <br/>\n  afternoon and expect things to be hunky-dory. You can&#39;t respect your <br/>\n  children&#39;s choices in learning but not respect their choices in life. <br/>\n          This is kind of the stage I&#39;m at.  I have a bizarre little story to insert here -- the other day, after church, my ds&#39;s Sunday School teacher stopped me to tell me he was concerned about my son.  Ds is nine, and in a class of all girls.  They tend to be very giggly and off-topic, and my son gets annoyed with them.  The teacher said, &quot;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong -- he is very polite and respectful and gets along well with adults, but he seems to think he is 16 or something, instead of 9.  He acts like he thinks the other kids are childish.  He is certainly a bright, sharp kid -- while I am struggling to explain to the others what an analogy is in the scriptures, he is able to not only understand, but apply and construe his own examples.  But he has no patience with them when they start getting off topic and fooling around.  He will actually get up and walk away if they won&#39;t settle down.  He doesn&#39;t know how to be a kid.  That&#39;s what I see the problem is with homeschooling.  Thoses kids don&#39;t know how to act around other kids.  You&#39;ve done fine with the academics, but he isn&#39;t very socialized.  In my professional opinion (he is a ninth grade teacher during the week), you need to get him involved with other kids a lot more, and you should think about putting him in school as soon as possible.  He needs to learn how to be part of a group; a team player.&quot;  I tried to explain that he is a Cub and a member of Junior Forest Wardens; that he went to swimming lessons and frequent field trips with a bunch of homeschool kids, and that we went and had a play day usually once a week at various friends houses, but he waved that aside.  I tried again.  &quot;He just doesn&#39;t like groups very much.  He is much happier one on one, and he also tends to be a leader.  As first born, he is used to being in charge a lot, and while I know he can get downright bossy, we have been trying to work on learning to compromise.  Maybe he is one of those kids who just prefers things to be the way he wants, and he&#39;d rather have a few close friends with similar goals and direction, than a throng of acquaintances. Kind of like Bill Gates, or something.&quot;  &quot;Or, like the Unabomber.  He has to learn to be part of a team -- just one of the players.  He needs to be put in positions where he HAS to do what the group wants, even if it is not what HE personally wants. He needs to learn to be one of the subordinates -- it is a situation he will be encountering all his life, and he needs to learn to deal with it now.&quot;  After a few more fruitless exchanges, I went away, totally dejected.  On the one hand, he was criticizing my son for knowing how to behave in church -- staying on topic, knowing his material, and wanting the others to be respectful to the teacher.  This is just how ds is -- he is a really focussed kid.  But I have certainly learned that *I* cannot choose that focus -- the minute I try to impose my goals on him, he shuts down.  SO he has obviously *chosen* to behave in what most people would consider an ideal manner in a public, teaching oriented forum.  (Notice I did not say &quot;learning&quot;?  *I* am learning!  :o)  )<br/>\n  However, the teacher is then using that as proof that my son is doomed to a reclusive life, as he is not a group kind of kid.  So my question is this:  do I need to be concerned?  Was this just some big deal that I was totally oblivious to, or does he really need to get a handle on dealing with groups?  And how does this reconcile with unschooling?  Obviously I cannot *force* him to be part of a crowd, but is this something he really needs to be encouraged in?  He sometimes gets sad because he has so few friends, but most of the time he is too busy with his own projects and stuff that he doesn&#39;t really seem to care.  And he does tend to think that kids his age are immature, although he is very patient and kind with his younger sisters.  Of course, most older kids we&#39;ve come across don&#39;t look too favorably on a bossy younger boy trying to include himself in their doings, either. What is the balance here?!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">    &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want visions of unschoolers at conventions <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  with pamphlets and smiling faces saying &quot;can I take some time to show you how to unschool the right way?&quot; <br/>\n          Why not?!  I&#39;d take one!  :o)  Debi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39133,"nextTopicId":39143}}
