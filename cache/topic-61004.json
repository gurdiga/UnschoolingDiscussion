Once you have that installed (there&#39;s<br/>\na free version) you click on radio at the bottom.  Then it shows you all the<br/>\ngenres.  I clicked on classical.  Then you get a list of the free stations.<br/>\nThey&#39;re mostly from the US, but there are stations in Germany, Norway,<br/>\nSweden, Great Britain, and lots of other places.  You click on the station<br/>\nyou want, it loads, and away you go.  I&#39;ve put Deutschland Radio Berlin,<br/>\nDeutschland Funk in Cologne, and NDR in Hamburg in my favourites.  If she<br/>\nlikes other music besides classical, there are probably some German stations<br/>\nfor that as well.  There are several talk stations from Germany.  I never<br/>\ntried radio before getting cable.  I think it would have been too slow for<br/>\nit.<br/>\nWhere is your mother from?
