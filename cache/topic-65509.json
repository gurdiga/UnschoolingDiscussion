They liked it so much I picked up the DVDs a few weeks ago that has the BBC productions of 4 of the 7 books (3 DVDs).  The older two loved it and sat through the last 3 in a row, about 6-7 hours I think it was, including popcorn breaks ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 11, 9, and 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam L.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8378727,"authorName":"zenmomma2kids","from":"&quot;zenmomma2kids&quot; &lt;zenmomma@...&gt;","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Kids&#39; Favorite books?","postDate":"1050863561","msgId":65552,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3dXA0OStxZDVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI3dWxraSs1Mm1rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65549,"nextInTopic":65556,"prevInTime":65551,"nextInTime":65553,"topicId":65509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
