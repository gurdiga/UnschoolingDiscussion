All 4 <br/>\nchildren will be getting their NRA memberships for Saturnalia.  We <br/>\nwill also enroll them in a gun safety class this summer (maybe <br/>\nsooner).  The boys will not be getting a gun of their own until they <br/>\nare a few years older.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have a gun in our home, but gun safety is so important.  One<br/>\nthought, I am &quot;paranoid&quot; about when our son goes to visit another child who<br/>\nhas a gun in the home, and was not taught safety or respect for guns.  I<br/>\ntold our son that if ANYONE ever takes out a gun in his presence, to say<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;  and leave and come right home!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also showed him gun safety.  I&#39;ve told him stories about his<br/>\ngrandfather (who was a police officer), and about animals and gun safety<br/>\n(my dad never believed in unloading his gun in front of our dog, as he knew<br/>\na fellow officer on the force whose dog jumped him when he unloaded his<br/>\ngun, causing the gun to go off and kill someone).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur little one has great admiration for soldiers in the armed forces and at<br/>\na recent trip to a military &quot;museum&quot; that has active military ships<br/>\nvisiting, I pointed out to our son the children pointing guns at others,<br/>\nand how wrong it was, and pointed out the soldiers and how they handled the<br/>\nguns (always pointing them down when cocking, etc.)  That had a major<br/>\npositive impact!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor fire safety, we go every year to the open firehouse, and we visit the<br/>\nfirehouses.  We even began practice drills at home, should there ever be a<br/>\nfire (stay low, don&#39;t open doors that are hot, etc.)  Being only 7,<br/>\nClifford the big red dog has a cute story, and it shows &quot;stop, drop and<br/>\nroll&quot; (but, we learned a new one that I hadn&#39;t known, at an open firehouse,<br/>\nto stop, cover the face, drop, and roll).<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting this has caused me to think about the local Red Cross.  I think<br/>\nthey have programs for children to take with their families, on safety and<br/>\nemergency care.  I think I&#39;ll look into that for us :-).  <br/>\n<br/>\nDiane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4484,"nextTopicId":4500}}
