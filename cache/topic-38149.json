My wife IS a physician, and while I am not any longer in any<br/>\nhealth-care field, I have some experience with the effects of substance<br/>\nabuse, and I know what I am speaking of.<br/>\n<br/>\nRitalin is related to several other abused substances and has similar<br/>\ncharacteristics.  &quot;Withdrawal&quot; is not among the dangers of the drug. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and may I remind you that you took a very BIG chance in doing <br/>\n&gt;this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope.  That is incorrect.  Leaving these boys ON Ritalin is more dangerous<br/>\nthan taking them off.  You may wish to read the list of side effects of the<br/>\ndrug, if you doubt.  Those side effects are the main reason kids who are<br/>\ngiven Ritalin or its substitutes are often later given additional dangerous<br/>\nchemicals; a veritable cocktail of substances -- each of which is supposed<br/>\nto counteract the side effects of the previously administered drug.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Please anyone that reads this letter please be aware that cold turkey is <br/>\n&gt;wrong<br/>\n&gt;even if it involves you as an adult.

You mistrust<br/>\nthe school system enough to get your kids away from it, but when it comes<br/>\nto the ill-advised mass medicating the school system has made &quot;standard<br/>\noperating procedure&quot;, some of you seem to have fallen for the bureaucrats&#39;<br/>\n&quot;wisdom&quot;.  Unfortunate, at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll say it again: Just Say No to drugs.  Your child does NOT need<br/>\npsychoactive substances.  They are DANGEROUS and unnecessary.

I don&#39;t take my kids to church, but <br/>\n&gt;when other people have, I haven&#39;t made a big deal, because the kids can say <br/>\n&gt;no if they really don&#39;t want to go.   Even if someone took Holly and marched <br/>\n&gt;her through a full week of Vacation Bible School and Baptist-life to try to <br/>\n&gt;convince her that she had to be born again, I could be calm about that, <br/>\n&gt;because Holly knows enough to be analytical and is not easily led.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is one of the best attitudes you can have with children -- you do the<br/>\nbest you can with them, allow them to make their own choices, and bear<br/>\nresponsibility for those choices -- since that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen<br/>\nANYWAY.  Besides, the best way for them to see what they like (or not) of<br/>\ntheir own lifestyle is to allow them to sample the lifestyles of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons we pick up my nephews on occassion is to allow them to<br/>\nlive in an environment free of drugging, verbal and physical abuse, and the<br/>\nother problems of their existence that they are forced to live with EVERY<br/>\nDAY, and maybe show them that life doesn&#39;t have to be that bad all the<br/>\ntime.  They may choose to change their situations or attitudes later in<br/>\nlife because of that taste of life from &quot;the other side&quot;, or not.  But we<br/>\nfelt it was important to give them that taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We allow TV watching at our house, and video games.  I would NOT even begin <br/>\n&gt;to agree to keep someone else&#39;s child for a week (nephews, neighbors, <br/>\n&gt;friends) on the parents&#39; terms if they were to say &quot;Don&#39;t let him watch TV&quot; <br/>\n&gt;or &quot;Make him go to bed at 9:00&quot; or &quot;If he says a bad word he has to be <br/>\n&gt;spanked.&quot;   They can keep him themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just as an aside, we&#39;re avid fans of no television.  By the same token, one<br/>\nof our family friends had their boy spend a weekend with us -- and they<br/>\nknew in advance that there was no TV available.  They have the courtesy to<br/>\nnot demand that we go out and buy a TV for their kid to watch.  A year<br/>\nlater, their child STILL talks of all the things we did with him that<br/>\nweekend -- which I doubt one could say about any video game or TV show the<br/>\nyoungster watched a year ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And if a family drugs their child even when he&#39;s home because a doctor said <br/>\n&gt;it was a good idea, if his being drugged daily is crucial to their peace of <br/>\n&gt;mind, they should keep him with them ever moment, because not all people are <br/>\n&gt;willing to give children stupifying drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, now, that certainly describes me.  As far as I am concerned, drugging<br/>\nchildren in most cases I consider to be abusive, just as making that child<br/>\nswallow a cupful of hard liquor would be (interestingly, the result is<br/>\nabout the same -- lethargy, lack of initiative, etc).  There are precious<br/>\nfew children who TRULY need ANY sort of psychoactive &quot;medication&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time, I&#39;m going to post the transcript of a conversation we had once<br/>\nwith the younger nephew, when we asked him if he knew WHY he was on drugs.<br/>\nIt was an excruciatingly sad conversation, which I am certain that could<br/>\nhave been repeated with a couple of million other young, innocent boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From yet another message:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t you realize that when children have been on medication, that they <br/>\n&gt; cannot<br/>\n&gt; go COLD TURKEY??? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;You can with Ritalin.<br/>\n&gt;In fact, many, many parents are advised to only give it to them during the <br/>\n&gt;school week and leave them off it on the weekends.
