We have no control over his actions. They&#39;re a natural response to<br/>\nour actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking away car privileges are imposed. That particular consequence doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnaturally arise from your daughter&#39;s actions. You could choose (or not<br/>\nchoose!) to impose that or any consequence. She is well aware that the power<br/>\nto impose the consequences or not is in your control.<br/>\n<br/>\nA *natural* consequence of not doing chores is whatever naturally results<br/>\nfrom not doing them: dirty toilets, garbage spilling onto the floor,<br/>\nirritated mom. Most kids don&#39;t really care about the natural consequences<br/>\n(except mom getting irritated *if* mom treats their feelings with as much<br/>\nrespect as she would like them to treat her feelings) so many parents resort<br/>\nto imposed consequences. Taking away or allowing car privileges is no<br/>\ndifferent than grades. They are both coercion to force others to do what we<br/>\nwant them to or behave as if they cared about the things we want them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Tami Labig-Duquette","from":"&quot;Tami Labig-Duquette&quot; &lt;labigduquette@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"gc3y2vngVePHT4ZpsDF7mmqBn89_Vc3VYAqByYMsrqaCJ6m9hlAni8VfNuXeFMSv2y76zXybYSsDHw73HtaDTPqcH3DfN5EYgmMRr3nrLForMEs1iUYXEQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Writing wasRe: [Unschooling-dotcom] For those who say I am NOT unschooling:","postDate":"1000062669","msgId":24881,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYyNTVnNGRDNXd3ejRydno3MDMwMDAwYjhmZkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24879,"nextInTopic":24883,"prevInTime":24880,"nextInTime":24882,"topicId":24561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sharon, Yes she does, doesn t she? :) indiana Tami You must be the change you wish to see in the world ~Ghandi Try out this fun site!

Of course<br/>\nthat list came about because my dear husband can&#39;t leave things be until<br/>\nthe kids do them.  He would wash the dishes, I would get mad because they<br/>\nhadn&#39;t done them and they would say, well we were going to but then dad<br/>\ndid them first.

I think it<br/>\nwas something like, &quot;I want to start college classes next semester, what<br/>\ndo I need to do to get ready.&quot;  From there we worked out some things she<br/>\nshould do to &#39;practice&#39; for what will be expected of her in college.  She<br/>\nhas the option to not do some of it.  If she does not do any of it<br/>\n(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  Not because<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t do her &#39;schoolwork&#39; but because she didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  The<br/>\njob sheet is pretty specific on chores but very nonspecific on other<br/>\nthings.  If nothing she did in the entire week fit any of the categories,<br/>\nshe has a problem and needs to look at it.  We also wave the list if she<br/>\nis doing something else that is cool but doesn&#39;t fit the list or if we<br/>\nare out of the house too much.<br/>\nBut the list itself is more a way to watch her symptoms than an effort to<br/>\ncontrol her.  She is just coming off a serious allergy attack that we<br/>\nnoticed because her functioning levels dropped.  Without the list, we may<br/>\nnot have noticed as soon.  We also think we have pinpointed the source of<br/>\nher headaches (maybe, I hope.)<br/>\nMy middle child, doesn&#39;t need the list but does it anyway just because. <br/>\nSometimes I think it is a competition thing with her sister but other<br/>\ntimes I think she thinks it is a game.<br/>\nMy son, is not unschooled.  He was until this past January and I think he<br/>\nwas okay but when my mom moved in next door, she started taking him over<br/>\nthere for a couple of hours a day.  She thinks he needs the structure<br/>\neven though I don&#39;t.   I think it isn&#39;t hurting him  and he will be fine<br/>\neither way.  He likes the attention he gets from grandma so he like going<br/>\nthere and it is working out for all of us.<br/>\nSo, two out of my three are unschooled.  And the third was and will be<br/>\nagain soon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRue - thank you for actually taking the time to listen to what I am<br/>\nsaying and ask for clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\nps - I was thinking last night, if you all want to insist that I am not<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; that&#39;s okay by me.  Even though what I am doing is pretty<br/>\nwell described on the unschooling.com site, I have never much cared for<br/>\nthe term myself.

I think <br/>\nit&#39;s been discussed at length at unschooling.com.   What you&#39;re using are a<br/>\nrtificial, imposed &quot;consequences&quot; (also known as &quot;punishment&quot;).  It&#39;s okay if <br/>\nyou want to do that, just be honest about the concept and terminology.<br/>\n<br/>\nHOW can an unschooler &quot;just sit around and do nothing all day&quot; if everything <br/>\nis educational?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she goes into a store and squishes bread, will she be unable to drive her <br/>\ngrandmother&#39;s car?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I watch &quot;too much&quot; TV, will the reception become fuzzy?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She is still free to do as she pleases but what she does affects how we<br/>\ntreat her. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnconditional love or unconditional positive regard are hard to practice but <br/>\nworth considering.  If parents are respectful of and kind to children, <br/>\nchildren wouldn&#39;t think of withholding the unloading of a dishwasher (not in <br/>\nmy experience, not with the really cooperative families I most admire in my <br/>\nlife).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe arguments in your paragraph above are like those used by abusive spouses. <br/>\n &quot;You had a choice.  You could have made a better dinner, and I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nthrown the casserole in the yard.&quot;  (To use an example of the father of <br/>\nsomeone I know.)  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Are you really<br/>\nsaying that you do not teach you children that actions have consequences?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children totally know that actions have consequences.  I didn&#39;t have to <br/>\nteach them that.  We don&#39;t make any &quot;consequences&quot; up.  We discuss things <br/>\nwith them, we don&#39;t make up arbitrary rules and schedules, we cooperate in <br/>\ngetting as many people in the family to as many places and activities as they <br/>\nneed to go to, and it has worked out peacefully and really well for many <br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly believe that it can work for other families too.  I&#39;ve seen it.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen families that started off that way, and other families that moved <br/>\ntoward it, and it seems better than the power struggles and arguments people <br/>\nhave to have when their policies are more important than their people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is scary:  &lt;&lt; If she chooses to do nothing then she does nothing<br/>\nin every sense of the word. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never had a child ever &quot;do nothing.&quot;  And for me to impose &quot;nothing&quot; <br/>\non them as a punishment because they didn&#39;t do what I declared to be <br/>\n&quot;something&quot; would be antagonistic, not supportive.  Not loving.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLa Leche League did it for me for life, and I&#39;m really grateful.  They said <br/>\nsome traditional feeding advice (that Ezzo freak, for one, although they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mention him) create an antagonism between the mother and child, and a <br/>\ngreat &quot;us and them&quot; mentality, but the mother and child are partners and <br/>\nshould remain so.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children aren&#39;t my enemies, nor bad otherlings who need to be made to <br/>\nbecome adult people when I say they&#39;re ready.  They&#39;re good people already.   <br/>\nThey help because they want to.  They help me because they trust me, and if I <br/>\nsay &quot;This is important&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m worried that this won&#39;t get done,&quot; they help <br/>\nme the same way I help them when something is important to them or worrying <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a big adjustment.

I think it<br/>\nwas something like, &quot;I want to start college classes next semester, what<br/>\ndo I need to do to get ready.&quot;  From there we worked out some things she<br/>\nshould do to &#39;practice&#39; for what will be expected of her in college.  She<br/>\nhas the option to not do some of it.  If she does not do any of it<br/>\n(including the weeks chores) then she looses some autonomy.  Not because<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t do her &#39;schoolwork&#39; but because she didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  The<br/>\njob sheet is pretty specific on chores but very nonspecific on other<br/>\nthings.  If nothing she did in the entire week fit any of the categories,<br/>\nshe has a problem and needs to look at it.  We also wave the list if she<br/>\nis doing something else that is cool but doesn&#39;t fit the list or if we<br/>\nare out of the house too much.<br/>\nBut the list itself is more a way to watch her symptoms than an effort to<br/>\ncontrol her.  She is just coming off a serious allergy attack that we<br/>\nnoticed because her functioning levels dropped.  Without the list, we may<br/>\nnot have noticed as soon.  We also think we have pinpointed the source of<br/>\nher headaches (maybe, I hope.)<br/>\nMy middle child, doesn&#39;t need the list but does it anyway just because. <br/>\nSometimes I think it is a competition thing with her sister but other<br/>\ntimes I think she thinks it is a game.<br/>\nMy son, is not unschooled.  He was until this past January and I think he<br/>\nwas okay but when my mom moved in next door, she started taking him over<br/>\nthere for a couple of hours a day.  She thinks he needs the structure<br/>\neven though I don&#39;t.   I think it isn&#39;t hurting him  and he will be fine<br/>\neither way.  He likes the attention he gets from grandma so he like going<br/>\nthere and it is working out for all of us.<br/>\nSo, two out of my three are unschooled.

I think I read them<br/>\nall, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong, because I have a hard time remembering who<br/>\nsaid what.  Did you say that you have a certain amount of time when your<br/>\nkids have to do certain things?  With the understanding that they can choose<br/>\nexactly how to fufill those requirements?  If so, *I* do not consider that<br/>\nunschooling, and I don&#39;t think the passage quoted from unschooling.com backs<br/>\nit up either.  If a child said, &quot;I really want to become a better writer.<br/>\nCan you help me get on some sort of a schedule so I can practice?&quot; and the<br/>\nparent put a system of time to be spent writing in place, that would be<br/>\nunschooling.  If a parent says, &quot;My child needs practice writing.  I will<br/>\nset aside some time, but they can write whatever they want.&quot; that would not<br/>\nbe unschooling.  There are many people on this list who don&#39;t believe that<br/>\nunschooling can or should be defined.  I disagree.  It means something.<br/>\nShould someone who disagrees with me be on the unschooling board?  Of<br/>\ncourse.  There&#39;s no law that says we all have to agree, and we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nmuch to talk about if we did.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Bridget E Coffman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 08, 2001 11:08 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] For those who say I am NOT<br/>\nunschooling:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sat, 8 Sep 2001 10:50:11 -0400 &quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot;<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skreams@...\">skreams@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did somebody tell you that if your child ASKS for structure you<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; give it to him or you&#39;re not unschooling?   ~Rue<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I described us I got back - Then you are not unschooling and you<br/>\nprobably don&#39;t want the unschooling list.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~If electricity comes from electrons...does that mean that morality<br/>\ncomes from morons?~~~~<br/>\nI sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>\n        Some letter of that After-life to spell;<br/>\nAnd by and by my Soul returned to me,<br/>\n        And answered, &quot;I Myself am Heaven and Hell.&quot;  --  The Rubaiyat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
