No set topics, <br/>\npretty much anything related to unschooling goes- and we all know that means <br/>\njust about everything! Another good way to get to know other people, and <br/>\nshare opinions and information about all sorts of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t write ANY of that, I don&#39;t work for the forum, I&#39;m just the <br/>\nvolunteer defender of radical unschooling and of the history of English.  But <br/>\nthe information is easy to come by, as are the best places for newcomers to <br/>\nunschooling.com to break in with intros and questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nComing into a discussion list which is sponsored by a specific forum, which <br/>\nwasn&#39;t created by its members, and then breaking off a new list isn&#39;t really <br/>\nawful, but it&#39;s worth reminding people that this list DOES have a set <br/>\npurpose, and policies, and is part of a larger forum.
