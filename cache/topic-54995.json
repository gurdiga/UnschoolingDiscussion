Do you need to<br/>\nmonitor their English and keep them up to speed so they don&#39;t fall behind?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut think about how kids learn Spanish in school and how hovering over them<br/>\nand keeping them working is necessary.

Advertisers want us to think programs designed to teach little<br/>\nkids a foreign langauge are amazing.

You know - judt do the things together, and separately, that you would do in vacation time. Read together. Watch videos.  Go to the library, the park, other outings. Spend time cooking. My little ones used to always.lov being with me, cleaning with a water spritz bottle or baking and talking...<br/>\nI kept a journal during this time too.  Well, still do, on and off. It helped me to really see what was going on - yes, there was learning  - without control.<br/>\n<br/>\nDecide to give it time - a good long time - and keep on being together and journalling, And read all you can - I really like The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith or Homeschooling Our Children Unschooling Oursleves by Alison McKee. And the messages at  www.unschooling.com<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and a few of us are on a little list of Catholic unschoolers, if you are interested, you can email me...
