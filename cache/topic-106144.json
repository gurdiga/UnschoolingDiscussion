I suggested (nicely) that maybe he wanted me to find him<br/>\nsomething else. Thats when DH pulled me aside and said&quot;I thought this<br/>\nunschooling thing was to let them choose who they want to be?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\nI think I fell in love with my DH again at that moment, I guess my<br/>\nbiggest hang-up would be the clothing choices/hygeine.(My oldest is 12<br/>\nand his theory is why shower when i&#39;m just gonna get dirty again I<br/>\ntried the you&#39;ll ruin the sheets routine, he said he&#39;d rather sleep on<br/>\nthe floor anyway lol) DH has always been easy going in that area. For<br/>\nexample my youngest carried around one of my old purses from age 2<br/>\ntill about age 4 , I was shocked my very manly (hunter, fisher,<br/>\nplumber) husband didn&#39;t have a kitten over that one. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother funny story , about a month or so ago my dad was in the<br/>\nhospital, when youngest ds went for a visit he said &quot;pappy what a<br/>\nawesome night shirt &quot; he thought it was the coolest, so when pappy<br/>\ncame home he brought it home for him. You&#39;d have thought it was<br/>\nchristmas he wore it for a week or so straight (Of course, me being me<br/>\ntold him &quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t wear it into wal-mart, they might think<br/>\nyou escaped from the hospital&quot;  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to ramble on life is just so much fun since we discovered<br/>\nunschooling :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great night,<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wilson family&quot;<br/>\n&lt;ssag@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;My dad MADE us wear shoes.
