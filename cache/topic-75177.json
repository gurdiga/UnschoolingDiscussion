Even within <br/>\nthe confines of an unschooling population, &quot;sensible&quot; will vary widely.     <br/>\nSome of us think it is sensible to style our hair and wear make-up every day, <br/>\nand some of us think it is sensible to shampoo once a week and never wear <br/>\nmake-up.  Both of those extremes are perfectly acceptable, neither is &quot;better&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;more right&quot;.    To some folks its sensible to pretend to be Kings and Queens.   <br/>\nTo some that is the most ridiculous thing they can imagine to do with thier <br/>\nspare time.   My husband thinks restoring old  bicycles is sensible.  Landon <br/>\nthinks collecting bullwhips is sensible.   I have no use for either, but I think <br/>\nit is perfectly sensible to collect cake pans.  ( who knows, I MIGHT need to <br/>\nbake a guitar cake one day).    Sensible shoes to me are not Birks, they are <br/>\nKeds<br/>\n<br/>\n   And as far as &quot;backing something up&quot; you can find research, documentation <br/>\nand resources to support just about anything.   There are far and away many  <br/>\nmore resources, studies, documentations, etc, supporting public schools, <br/>\nspanking, and  conventional parenting methods than there are for unschooling.

I honestly do not understand what is so hard to grasp about the <br/>\nconcept that individuals perceive things differently. Again, I never said <br/>\nauthority, rank or  heirarchies do not exist. Rather the possibility for humans to <br/>\n&quot;reject&quot; them as being an acceptable continuim, in which we must live, is a <br/>\nvaild view. Often humans get so comfortable with the way things are, that they <br/>\nbegin to believe change is not necessary. If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s when they close their eyes to the possibilities that it may be broke and <br/>\nshould be fixed, that narrow-mindedness occurs. So it suprises me very much, that <br/>\non a list of free thinkers, there is disreguard for seeing other POV&#39;s. It&#39;s <br/>\nnot a matter of agreeing or disagreeing, right or wrong, but that alternative <br/>\nthinking does exist (just as rank does). Everyones big picture will be <br/>\ndifferent. I would be shocked if my big picture mirrored anyone else on this planet. <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean I should look at anothers big picture and disquailfy it. It <br/>\nworks for them.
