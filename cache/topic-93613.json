Mine are 7 and 4 <br/>\nyears old. Either one of them can get and pour cereal, make toast, or <br/>\ndish up yogurt for themselves. The 7 year old can make pancakes by <br/>\nhimself, but likes for me to operate the waffle iron. If we make <br/>\npancakes or waffles, we usually mix up a double or triple batch. Put <br/>\nthe leftovers in baggies in the freezer, then either kid can heat one <br/>\nup in the microwave if they want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDitto with oatmeal, make a big batch and put the rest in the fridge. <br/>\nI like mine with shredded coconut and pecans or walnuts. My daughter <br/>\nlikes hers with diced apples and cinnamon. Son likes his plain.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids like &quot;Egg shapes&quot; - make a thinnish flat omelette and <br/>\nuse cookie cutters to cut it into fun shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my kids like &quot;special eggs&quot; - we got this recipe from the <br/>\nSample Lady at Trader Joe&#39;s (my kids love the sample lady):<br/>\nIn a bowl, scramble eggs with milk (1 Tbs per egg). Add a scoop of <br/>\nsun-dried tomato pesto and stir until mixed. Scramble eggs like <br/>\nnormal. When they&#39;re just about done, crumble feta cheese in and let <br/>\nmelt (My note: sheep&#39;s milk feta cheese is awesome, very smooth and <br/>\nmild. Cow&#39;s milk feta tastes like old sweat socks to me. So if you or <br/>\nyour kids think you don&#39;t like feta, try the sheep&#39;s milk kind). <br/>\nGarnish with chives. We grow our own chives and the kids love to take <br/>\nscissors and cut them up into garnish-sized pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like any kind of wrap made with scrambled eggs. Like:<br/>\n - Monterey Jack, bacon, and guacamole<br/>\n - Spicy sausage, cheddar, and salsa<br/>\n - Mushrooms, spinach, and Asiago cheese<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all I can think of right now. I used to be a Hobbit-breakfast <br/>\nperson when I ate cereal or more carbs for breakfast. Now I&#39;ve been <br/>\ntrying a higher protein breakfast and find that I&#39;m not hungry an <br/>\nhour or two later like I used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: un breakfast","postDate":"1083968725","msgId":93653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWM0MzQ4MyQ2NDlhMjQwMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBNYXJ5RWxsZW4+","referencesHeader":"PGM3Z245dCtkZjkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjAwNDA1MDcxNTQ1LjI1MjMwLmpveWZ1bGxpZmVAbXd0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":93647,"nextInTopic":93657,"prevInTime":93652,"nextInTime":93654,"topicId":93613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I knew a woman from Switzerland.

Frozen waffles are fast and easy (we buy them, but you could make and freeze your own).  You can make pancakes or french toast in advance and reheat in the toaster or toaster oven also.  In the summer we also like frozen popsicles that we make out of juices or juice/yoghurt or juice/fruit/nutbutters.  Homemade granola is easy to have on hand.  Do you eat quick oats or steel cut?  For steel cut, you can put it on in the crockpot overnight and have it ready (and keeping hot) for whoever wants it all morning.  Quick oats/ cream of wheat are fast to make with water boiled in the microwave in a cup with a pour spout.  Boil some eggs (if your kids like them) and keep them in the refrigerator (they keep for at least a week). <br/>\n<br/>\nFor breakfast recently, I have been eating either (1) plain yoghurt with garam masala, cinnamon, a little maple syrup and a handful of &quot;raw&quot; quick oats or (2) little balls made of almond butter, fig spread, cocoa and oats.  Very tasty with coffee, btw.   Both quick and stick-to-ribsy. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: One of the Wechts <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 07, 2004 9:13 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] un breakfast<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n  What I love about our lifestyle is the freedom to eat when and what we want.<br/>\n  We often do the Hobbit thing of 2nd Breakfast. elevensees etc.  Here is my request.<br/>\n  I am looking for food ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":164542605,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"&quot;Danielle Conger&quot; &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] un breakfast","postDate":"1083938530","msgId":93621,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjcwMWM0MzQzYiRlNDUwOWU2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBrdXNoNjkwMD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWM0MzQzNSQyNzcwNTIwMCQyMmNmZmVhOUBob21lMT4="},"prevInTopic":93620,"nextInTopic":93622,"prevInTime":93620,"nextInTime":93622,"topicId":93613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Beth writes:  So, with different tastes, schedules etc I need ideas.

Quick<br/>\nand easy, and certainly non-traditional ideas are welcome (especially those<br/>\nthings that will &quot;stick to your ribs&quot;).  I have no creativity when it comes<br/>\nto food.<br/>\n=====================================<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do second breakfast here, too, but my kids are perfectly ammenable to<br/>\ncold cereal for first breakfast. Then we do something bigger--eggs,<br/>\npancakes, waffles--for second breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow &#39;bout getting yours more involved in making their own breakfast? I&#39;ll do<br/>\nvariations on a theme but generally not completely different breakfasts for<br/>\neveryone. I&#39;m happy, for instance, to make eggs the way people like them and<br/>\ngive them whatever bread product they like best if we&#39;re doing eggs, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t do eggs, waffles and french toast. Instead, we&#39;d make a compromise to<br/>\ndo everyone&#39;s favorites over a couple of days or something like that. Mine<br/>\nare still pretty young (6, 5 and 4), so they can&#39;t really do the cooking for<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids *really* will only eat what they want and aren&#39;t up for<br/>\ncompromise, that sounds like a pretty tough situation. The best scenario<br/>\nthen would be for people to just make their own meal if no group meal can be<br/>\ndecided upon, I would think. Of course, you can always have toaster waffles<br/>\ninstead of fresh waffles. You and the interested child could make batches<br/>\nonce or twice a week to pull out and heat up if you wanted homemade. You<br/>\ncould keep batter in the fridge to just pull out and eliminate that step, at<br/>\nleast, for pancakes. Certainly, the kids ought to be able to make their own<br/>\noatmeal or cream of wheat, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re fond of bagels here, which you didn&#39;t mention. With cream cheese,<br/>\nthey&#39;re a complete protein and pretty filling. You can make egg sandwhiches<br/>\nwith bagels or english muffins--add a slice of cheese and bacon and they&#39;re<br/>\neven tastier and more filling (imo). You could get those refridgerator<br/>\nbiscuits--grands or whatever--pull those out to make breakfast biscuit<br/>\nsandwiches. We do cheese grits, which are very stick-to-your-ribs, but the<br/>\nkids won&#39;t eat them--just dh and I. Hmmm... there are some really tasty egg<br/>\ncasseroles you can make up in advance and heat up during the week: scrambled<br/>\neggs, cheese and sausage is one of my favorites. You can also make up<br/>\nbreakfast burritoes in advance and put them in the freezer to pull out and<br/>\nheat up individually. You could get the kids involved in making those things<br/>\ntoo--kinda like having one big baking day. *shrug* That&#39;s all I can think of<br/>\nright now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129185313,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;mimi36@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] un breakfast","postDate":"1083938448","msgId":93620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjAwMWM0MzQzYiRiNjY0ZjE0MCRjOTQyMjZkMEBuZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWQwMWM0MzQzNSQyNzcwNTIwMCQyMmNmZmVhOUBob21lMT4gPDQwOUI5MTU2LjUwNDA0MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":93619,"nextInTopic":93621,"prevInTime":93619,"nextInTime":93621,"topicId":93613,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Beth, I can certainly sympathize, my three girls have different dietary needs and schedules so all meal times can be challenging.
