No homeschooling<br/>\norganization is as professional, media and politically savvy, nor as<br/>\neconomically sound. The HSLDA is, however, not the authoritative voice of<br/>\nhomeschooling. They are an authoritative voice for, and of, some in<br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause most of us in higher education are ignorant of the realities of<br/>\nhomeschooling, it&#39;s important to point out that the The National Center<br/>\nfor Home Education (NCHE), a division of HSLDA, which networks state-wide<br/>\norganizations in all 50 states, only networks organizations built upon<br/>\nlocal groups the majority of which generally require a statement of<br/>\nreligious faith as a condition of membership. The tenets of these<br/>\nstatements of faith substantively eliminate non-Christians, theologically<br/>\nobservant Catholics, some Protestants, secular humanists, and Mormons<br/>\namong others. And this exclusionism is reflected in the HSLDA web site<br/>\nwhich doesn&#39;t refer to state groups other than those seemingly built on<br/>\nstatements of faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parents who have no interest in the theological and political views<br/>\nof the HSLDA or these state groups, or who are ignorant of them, join the<br/>\nHSLDA for the legal protection which it can provide, and therefore are<br/>\ncounted as committed members of the HSLDA for statistical purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe political and religious views of the HSLDA probably represent a<br/>\nsignificantly large plurality of homeschool families. But, at the present<br/>\ntime, the largest growing segment (by percentage of growth) of<br/>\nhomeschoolers are probably those who start to homeschool for non-religious<br/>\nreasons - perhaps a Columbine type of reaction is the reason, or a<br/>\nperception of a poor education in public schools coupled with an inability<br/>\nof the parents to afford a private or parochial school education.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA has done many really important things such as their involvement<br/>\nin the recent redefinition of the conditions under which homeschooled<br/>\nstudents can receive aid. They are constructing Patrick Henry, a college<br/>\nin Virginia for homeschooled students - with a law school - which is<br/>\nintended to train up a Godly generation of students to gradually move into<br/>\npositions of political influence.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately for us in higher education, and for many homeschool parents,<br/>\nthere is no national group to whom one can turn in a busy day that can be<br/>\nsaid to represent the non-HSLDA constituencies, which are often fractious<br/>\nto the point of irrelevancy when it comes to financial aid and admissions<br/>\nissues. There are many local groups, there are some effective state<br/>\norganizations, but aside from the HSLDA and the NCHE network, there is no<br/>\nhomeschool group today which has the expertise and economic base to<br/>\naddress financial aid and admissions issues on a national and regional<br/>\nbasis in a consistent and timely fashion, especially now when<br/>\nhomeschooling is becoming such a hot issue. It&#39;s a big problem. There is,<br/>\nhowever, the beginning of a new inclusive national homeschool<br/>\ncommunications network, the National Home Education Network (NHEN), which<br/>\nis attempting to set up an inclusive communications and resource network.<br/>\nIt remains to be seen if this will have long term viability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA&#39;s positions clearly are not universally admired in<br/>\nhomeschooling. Nor are its partisan political stances. Much of the<br/>\nresearch it sponsors is based in a segment of homeschoolers and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreflect the diversity of homeschooling and so the research conclusions<br/>\nwhich are drawn must be understood in context. Many homeschoolers don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel comfortable with the HSLDA&#39;s approach to testing, standards, and<br/>\npedagogy. Lastly, many homeschoolers feel that the HSLDA&#39;s intervention in<br/>\nlegal issues in certain states has on occasion been misguided, short<br/>\nsighted, or partisan, acting not as true representatives of all<br/>\nhomeschoolers, but just of those who are truly confirmed members of<br/>\nNational Center for Home Education groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dealing with homeschooling, it&#39;s always important to have more than<br/>\none source for information because how things are presented are often<br/>\nconditioned by the ideological underpinnings of the source. For instance,<br/>\nwhen looking at state laws governing homeschooling, in addition to<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hslda.org\">http://www.hslda.org</a>&gt; it might be a good idea to also use<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nhen.org/legnet/index.html\">http://nhen.org/legnet/index.html</a>&gt; for the sake of comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA doesn&#39;t represent homeschoolers in general even though one might<br/>\ngain that impression from HSLDA press releases. And since the HSLDA/NCHE<br/>\npoint of view and agenda is anathema to many in homeschooling, the<br/>\nlimitations of this viewpoint on issues affecting homeschooling cannot be<br/>\neffectively understood in a context in which the critical faculties are<br/>\nsuspended.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSean Callaway<br/>\nDirector of College Placement<br/>\nThe Center for Urban Education<br/>\nPace University School of Education<br/>\nOne Pace Plaza<br/>\nNew York, NY  10038<br/>\nTel: (212) 346-1568<br/>\nFax: (212) 346-1078<br/>\nE-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scallaway@...\">scallaway@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis message  |  Submissions            mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FINAID-L@...\">FINAID-L@...</a><br/>\nwas sent via  |  Subscribe/unsubscribe  mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LISTSERV@...\">LISTSERV@...</a><br/>\nthe FINAID-L  |  List owner (Bob Quinn) mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:REQ1@...\">REQ1@...</a><br/>\nmailing list  |  backup    (Pete Weiss) mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:FINAID-L-REQUEST@...\">FINAID-L-REQUEST@...</a><br/>\n--------------|  award                  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psu.edu/dept/finaid-l/\">http://www.psu.edu/dept/finaid-l/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nGET A NEXTCARD VISA, in 30 seconds!
