You may call me - (301) 916-XXXX.<br/>\nMay I suggest one thing first? There are many, many homeschooling<br/>\ncurriculums out there that tend to focus on Book learning. Many<br/>\nhomeschoolers have moved beyond the teaching/learning styles that are used<br/>\nin schools since most of those styles were developed  to teach a large<br/>\nnumber of students at one time.The average HSing family (if there is such a<br/>\nmythical beast) has far fewer children. Many of those teaching techniques<br/>\ndon&#39;t apply. My suggestion is for your team to read or even just skim<br/>\nthrough a few books on learning outside of the classroom. I heartily<br/>\nrecommend two of John Holt&#39;s books, How Children Fail and How Children<br/>\nLearn, and The Unschooling Handbook By Mary Griffith. These three books will<br/>\ngive you an insight into how learning happens naturally and I believe it<br/>\nwill contribute immensely to your development of this product.<br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you.<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nElissa J.
