I could find the word for shampoo in my little <br/>\ndictionary, but not that for conditioner. Without the &#39;label&#39; - or in <br/>\nother words, a word that meant the same thing to both me and the <br/>\nshopkeepers, I had to use sign language. And all they offered me was <br/>\nshampoo. By the time I got back to England, my hair was ruined and I had <br/>\nto have it cut short. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had hair conditioner all around you and you didn&#39;t even know it!<br/>\nApparently an olive oil/honey mixture works well as a conditioner. I haven&#39;t tried it yet, but I certainly would if I were in Greece faced with your circumstances.<br/>\nHere is a recipe for it, if you can&#39;t get a hold of conditioner, or if you want soft, shiny hair the &quot;natural&quot; way. ;-) Sorry your hair was ruined.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRosemary Honey Hair Conditioner <br/>\n<br/>\nThe extremes of heat and cold we endure throughout winter can make even the greatest of hair look and feel like straw. This nourishing conditioner blends honey for shine; olive oil for moisture and essential oil of rosemary to stimulate hair growth. <br/>\n<br/>\nGather: <br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 cup honey  <br/>\n<br/>\n1/4 cup warmed olive oil (2 tablespoons for normal to oily hair) <br/>\n<br/>\n4 drops essential oil of rosemary <br/>\n<br/>\n1 teaspoon of xanthan gum (available in health food stores) (this could probably be skipped if necessary)<br/>\n<br/>\n Place all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour into a clean plastic bottle with a tight fitting stopper of lid.Apply a small amoung at a time to slightly dampened hair. Massage scalp and work mixture through hair until completely coated. Cover hair with a warm towel (towel can be heated in a microwave or dryer) or shower cap; leave on to nourish and condition for 30 minutes. Remove towel or shower cap; shampoo lightly and rinse with cool water. Dry as normal and enjoy shinier, softer and healthier hair the natural way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33275,"nextTopicId":33234}}
