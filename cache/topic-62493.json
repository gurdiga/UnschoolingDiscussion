Homeschoolers are not subject to any NCLB mandate, <br/>\nincluding the excessive burden of high-stakes testing and the <br/>\nnegative impact of that testing on children&#39;s love of learning.  This <br/>\nweek, though, I read a press release that gave me pause.  It came <br/>\nfrom the US Department of Education and announced guidance and <br/>\ninformation on the ways that NCLB impacts charter schools and school <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat press release got me to thinking.  There are thousands - or <br/>\nhundreds of thousands? - of children learning at home under the <br/>\ndirection of public education institutions, including charter <br/>\nschools, alternative schools, independent study programs, cyber <br/>\nschools, and the like.  These children are NOT &quot;written out&quot; of NCLB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder, do families whose children are enrolled in public programs <br/>\nREALIZE that they fall under all aspects of NCLB?  Do they understand <br/>\nthat their children will be subjected to more bouts of invasive <br/>\ntesting?  Do they mistakenly believe they are excused because the <br/>\nchildren do not attend regular public school classes?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know these answers, but I do know that to make informed <br/>\nchoices, parents need relevant information.  To that end, here are <br/>\nsome resources to help families learn more about NCLB issues.<br/>\n**<br/>\n<br/>\nHeadline: Resources to help you find out if a program falls under <br/>\nNCLB A couple of checklists of helpful questions to ask of a <br/>\nprogram&#39;s staff are found in this discussion about charter schools, <br/>\nstarting with March 24. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=108\">http://www.nhen.org/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=108</a><br/>\nAlternatively, your local or state homeschooling support group leader <br/>\nwill know or know who to ask.<br/>\n**<br/>\nHome Education Magazine provides background material:<br/>\n*How William Bennett&#39;s Public E-Schools Affect Homeschooling*<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/196/ndtch.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/196/ndtch.html</a><br/>\n*Why Independence Is Essential To Homeschooling*<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/195/sotch.html\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/195/sotch.html</a><br/>\n**<br/>\nLearn more about the drawbacks of &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; from the <br/>\nviewpoint of a former<br/>\nteacher / principal / public school administrator:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nochildleft.com/2003/jancov03.html\">http://www.nochildleft.com/2003/jancov03.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n**<br/>\nHeadline: From the U.S. Government<br/>\n&quot;No Child Left Behind&quot;Legislation<br/>\nNear the bottom of this page is the code that excludes homeschoolers, <br/>\nSEC. 9506.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ed.gov/legislation/ESEA02/pg111.html#sec9506\">http://www.ed.gov/legislation/ESEA02/pg111.html#sec9506</a><br/>\n**<br/>\nPress Release from The U.S. Department of Education, March 25, 2003<br/>\nHeadline: Department Issues New Charter School Guidance<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/03-2003/03252003.html\">http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/03-2003/03252003.html</a><br/>\n&quot;The U.S. Department of Education has issued guidance [that] provides <br/>\ngeneral information on how No Child Left Behind (NCLB) impacts <br/>\ncharter schools...&quot;<br/>\n**<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\nHomeschoolers - and a Mom - in the News<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\nAnn: Congratulations and a big thank you, Gov.
