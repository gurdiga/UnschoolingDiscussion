Now mine are young, so I may change my views later,<br/>\nbut...  It seems that as children grow and develop interests and friends<br/>\nthat time away from their siblings will occur as a result of that.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I need to put a lot of energy into artificially creating<br/>\nseparate spaces for each child.<br/>\nMy $.02!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m sure this brings siblings closer and we end up with a tight-knit<br/>\n </span></blockquote>family instead of only spending a few hours in the evenings together, IF<br/>\nTHAT!!
