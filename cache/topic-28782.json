Says Brooks. &quot;Rethinking Education is the perfect audience for my film about the horror that is public school and the beauty of freedom and child-led learning.&quot;<br/>\n  SCHOOLED is an earthy character study about a teacher in crisis who&#39;s burned out from teaching high school. He leaves his job and his wife to take time off and he discovers a shockingly different type of school. It&#39;s democratically run so even the youngest students have equal power. That means: no tests, no grades, and no homework. If a kid wants to play video games all day, that choice is totally supported. Fred knows this is ridiculous and that it&#39;s really just an excuse for teachers to be as lazy as the kids. Yet the more he hangs around the place, the more his fundamental concepts about authority figures get challenged. By the time he leaves, he still thinks the place is nuts, although it&#39;s given him the insight to face the even deeper crisis that spawned the journey in the first place: should he become a father?<br/>\n  In an upcoming newsletter we will feature an interview with producer and director Brooks Elms... stay tuned!<br/>\n<br/>\n                    JOIN US!<br/>\n  <br/>\n   Join hundreds of unschooling families from around the globe as we rethink the meanings of education, learning and parenting.

And yes, as adults we can even unschool ourselves... as you will discover.<br/>\n<br/>\n                    <br/>\n   Let us put our minds together and see what we will make for our children.<br/>\n  Chief Sitting Bull<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Our 2007 Program is the Best Ever<br/>\n<br/>\n   Just look at this roster of outstanding speakers we&#39;ve lined up for the Rethinking Education Conference 2007:<br/>\n      <br/>\n   John Taylor Gatto  <br/>\n   Michael Mendizza  <br/>\n   Ren Allen  <br/>\n   Peter Kowalke  <br/>\n   Cindy Gaddis  <br/>\n   Tracy Liebmann<br/>\n  <br/>\n  And so many more!<br/>\n<br/>\n                    What To Do NOW<br/>\n    Register... we want you there!
