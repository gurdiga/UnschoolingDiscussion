I thought, all last evening and all today, about whether I should talk directly to Elliot or go to his parents. ( Side note: I&#39;ve only met his mom once. I know from what other neighbors have said that they go to church and are supposedly strict Christians. I should also note that we are military and live in post housing. We live in multiplexes, 4 units in a building, so we don&#39;t have much of a yard. The kids play up and down the whole street. The one thing about living in gov. quarters is that if the MP&#39;s get called a certain number of times on your kids they will evict you.) So I do have some recourse although I really don&#39;t want it to come to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, tonight my choice was made for me. We had only been home a short time and the kids were outside playing. I went out and Elliot and Kyle were again in the same situation as last evening with Elliot taking the gun and running off with it. This time though I ended up jumping his ass. He is so disrespectful to everyone and it pissed me off. That is not how I had intended it to go. I laid it all out for him, why I had not jumped in before now and what I would no longer tolerate. I did tell him that I will call the MP&#39;s if it doesn&#39;t stop. He doesn&#39;t accept responsibility for any of his actions. All he kept trying to do was bring up old infractions that Kyle had done that had been handled a long time ago. I talked to his mom after I got done with him. She said that they are very open about what they discuss with their kids so that they can dispell what the kids pick up at school.  I can agree with that part, sounds rather unschooly. She said she would talk to him about the bully stuff and the overt sexual behavior. I don&#39;t know what will actually come of it though. On one hand, she was telling me all these things she didn&#39;t agree with him doing and then on the other, she said that&#39;s just how Elliot is. She didn&#39;t agree with any of the possibilities that I brought up, like him trying to get attention or him always trying to be the most powerful and on top.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said it is ironic that this is happening today ( last day of school) because everyone at school was telling her how good his behavior has been.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, at the end of the conversation, we saw eye to eye on what should be the end result of all of this but we will see if that actually happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L, you were right on with your post about the whole thing. I felt the same way that you were describing. I want to be able to help other kids when they need it but my kids come first. I&#39;m such a bleeding heart for people and especially animals. People don&#39;t act out for no good reason though so you know something has to be troubling him. It&#39;s sad though if his mom isn&#39;t willing to find out what&#39;s at bottom of his behavior. Part of me feels guilty about letting this go on for as long as it did. Kyle doesn&#39;t have any ill feelings toward me about it though. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your concern<br/>\nDina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73657,"nextTopicId":73970}}
