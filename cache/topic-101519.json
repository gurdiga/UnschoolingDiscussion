I did pick up the drum-controller.  I don&#39;t normally spend that much on Christmas gifts for a niece or nephew, but his parents are pretty generous towards our family.

Do they hook up to the gamecube somehow? Or is it just as much fun to <br/>\nhave any old kongas for multiple players?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBongos.  I think the name of the game should have been Bongo Kazooie, because <br/>\nit&#39;s really not a conga-drum situation&lt;g&gt;.   The bongos that come with the <br/>\nset are game controllers.  They plug in right where the controllers would have, <br/>\nand touching the drums are left and right (on menus) and there&#39;s a &quot;start&quot; <br/>\nbutton on front of the drums (in a subtle place so they don&#39;t have the appearance <br/>\nof being controllers).   <br/>\n<br/>\nExtra drums are $30 a set (same price as any controllers).  They&#39;re not <br/>\nmanufactured by Nintendo, but are made specifically for that game by another <br/>\ncompany.  In two-player mode, the way you hit your drums affects the way your <br/>\n&quot;character&quot; hits his.  If I make a mistake, the guy on the screen makes exactly the <br/>\nsame mistake, and that&#39;s what the score is based on.  So you&#39;re controlling an <br/>\non-screen cartoon drummer, with your drums.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101517,"nextTopicId":101507}}
