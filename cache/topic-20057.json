There&#39;s a big difference between sitting in<br/>\n&gt; your room by yourself just thinking, and sitting in<br/>\n&gt; front of a TV screen and watching. Monk does not<br/>\n&gt; have silent time *at all* when he has access to the<br/>\n&gt; television. He does have it (and he&#39;s pretty happy<br/>\n&gt; with it, I might add) when the television is off. I<br/>\n&gt; mean, if he could watch TV AND manage to have<br/>\n&gt; &quot;non-noise&quot; down time, I&#39;d say that would be<br/>\n&gt; ok...but he can&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Monk and I talked about this last night, and he<br/>\n&gt; agreed that we could keep the TV off unless it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; rainy day or our special movie night. He seems OK<br/>\n&gt; with that decision, and I&#39;m OK with it, too...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just think it&#39;s interesting that TV viewing has<br/>\n&gt; such a profound effect on him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; livelifelove<br/>\n&gt; Lainie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
