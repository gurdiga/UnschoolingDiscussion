While there is no easy way to let sink in just how<br/>\nunhappy a situation is for our child, Your son really gave this some<br/>\nthought to make sure that he got his point across.  Not many 9 yo would<br/>\nhave thought of the pie charts.

My son also liked PE the<br/>\nmost in school. So we made sure to have lots of physical things spread out<br/>\nthrough the week.  With art getting so little a section, maybe he just<br/>\nneeds to see real art.  My children hated art at school. Each year they<br/>\nmade ceramics. they hated ceramics by the time they left. I have so many<br/>\nbowls I don&#39;t know what to do with them. That&#39;s all they made, bowls.  But<br/>\nthey saw me crocheting and asked me to show them how, they both did well<br/>\nand enjoyed it. Cross stitching was harder and after asking, they decided<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t for them. But we found that my youngest loves abstract art, so<br/>\nwe&#39;ve made sure to expose him to as much as possible. He also enjoys<br/>\ncreating comics and characters. He will come to us and ask us to give him a<br/>\ncrazy name, he will go off and make up a complete personality and a drawing<br/>\nto go with it. We&#39;ve got entire sketch pads filled with these.

If you&#39;re interested in my story I&#39;d <br/>\n&gt;love to share it, but first I have a few questions:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow that sounds about as fast as the decision we made with my son. He was<br/>\nbugging me, but I didn&#39;t think he and I would survive, then one day things<br/>\ngot ugly at school he came home and told me he didn&#39;t want to ever go back<br/>\nand out of frustration at hearing this for months I remarked &quot;Then don&#39;t&quot;<br/>\nHe never went back and I had some real quick decisions to make to get us<br/>\napproved as it was still the school year and we didn&#39;t have the permission<br/>\nyet, so until I got everything together he was considered truant.  I think<br/>\nthey finally took pity on me and didn&#39;t turn us in because there were only<br/>\nreally something like seven days left to the year and he hadn&#39;t missed much<br/>\nschool so he was marked absent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe took those days (while his brother was still in school trying to decide<br/>\nif this was for him too) to get to know each other. Granted we had to<br/>\nfigure out our objectives so it gave us time to talk about his past years<br/>\nin school a little more level headed while we wrote these up.  We had<br/>\nlunches together and took walks to clear our heads ... But we grew much<br/>\ncloser during this time which was the turning point here. I&#39;d suggest since<br/>\nit&#39;s the end of the year anyway that you are starting. Take the summer to<br/>\nheal as a family. Let the children suggest activities that they&#39;d missed<br/>\ndoing (if you are up to it) if it helps carry a notepad to jot down the<br/>\nthings that you&#39;ve discussed/done that would fit into the &quot;subject areas&quot;<br/>\nif you were keeping track or had to for your district. That way you may<br/>\nfeel more comfortable with unschooling while at the same time you will all<br/>\nbe together learning about each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-It is my understanding that kids at this age (9) usually need 3-6 months <br/>\n&gt;&quot;de-tox time&quot;.  Has anyone been through this?  What was your experience?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, mine was 10 and because of a horrible experience being labeled ADD and<br/>\nbeing told he&#39;d never make it in the real world he had no self esteem.. It<br/>\ntook him the entire first year home and then a couple more months. But once<br/>\nhe found that he wasn&#39;t stupid he perked right up and has been so happy.<br/>\nHopefully it won&#39;t take that long for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What did you do with your child during this time?  How long did it take to <br/>\n&gt;&quot;get your child back&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have my son back, both of them actually. It didn&#39;t take as long with my<br/>\noldest as he was an honor student so the self esteem issues were different<br/>\nthan his brothers.  What did we do?  Well when Sept hit we tried school at<br/>\nhome, with workbooks and stuff. But by nov we were unschooling. so my time<br/>\nwas the summer vacation where we simply talked about what they wanted out<br/>\nof our &quot;school year&quot;. For my youngest who was 10, we simply knew we needed<br/>\na hands on approach for him to learn, but finding the right approach that<br/>\nhe would feel he was learning something without it being school or<br/>\nsomething that he hated.  My oldest finally started spending time with his<br/>\nbrother and learning that he really did like him. They spent hours in the<br/>\nwoods by our home tracking animals and drawing the prints they found to<br/>\nkeep a diary of, we started going bowling together a couple times a month<br/>\nwith hsers, we took lots of walks.  the downside in the beginning was that<br/>\nthey were obsessed with tv and video games. I thought I was going to lose<br/>\nit with the tv, but that ended as soon as they realized that they were<br/>\nbored. My oldest simply wanted to have the time to watch all the shows that<br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t while in school, but then realized that to follow all these you<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have a life. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s turned the tv on since Thurs.<br/>\nnight when we rented a movie. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-Wesley is very good at math and he likes it a lot.

I am open to suggestions and ideas.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let him have a calculator to check what he does. Actually my oldest says<br/>\nthat he sees the math in his head so what he shows on paper is completely<br/>\nconfusing to me. I don&#39;t even try to figure it out, it works for him and<br/>\nthat seems to be all that matters.  If your son asks for help, then you can<br/>\nshow him the steps, but he might be on to something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-Wesley has a 2 year old sister (Very 2!).  I have heard that one of the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>most <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;difficult times to homeschool is with a toddler in the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have a toddler, so I can&#39;t help much, but what do you do during<br/>\nsummer vacations?  I think that personally a toddler would only be a<br/>\nhinderance if you were doing school at home where you needed the time to<br/>\nsit at the table uninterrupted. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;experiences and how have you coped with having a toddler in the house?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When mine were small, (and before school) they spent a lot of time outside.<br/>\nThe younger one would play hours of basketball on the court so I&#39;d find a<br/>\nseat and let him play. During that time my oldest could ride his bike<br/>\naround where I could see or could have my attention. We read a lot while<br/>\nthe younger one, supposedly playing basketball, actually listened.  I<br/>\nrealized how much he was listening when last year I asked him if he wanted<br/>\nme to read him Tom Sawyer as it was one of his brothers favorites. He told<br/>\nme he remembered me reading it while he played basketball.  I didn&#39;t really<br/>\nbelieve he remembered the story, but just to prove the point he told me the<br/>\nstory mostly in order letting me know all his favorite parts. BTW his<br/>\nfavorite part was how Tom convinced the others to whitewash the fence. He<br/>\ndid ask what whitewash was, but he knew the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;-How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the <br/>\n&gt;time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s different at each stage. I&#39;m a single mother so I&#39;ve never had time<br/>\naway. When they were little, they had bedtimes so that was my time, when<br/>\nthey came home from school they were older so they didn&#39;t want a bedtime,<br/>\nnow my time is when they go out to play as they don&#39;t need me to follow<br/>\nthem around.   You&#39;ll find your time, even if it&#39;s getting up a little<br/>\nearlier for that one cup of tea before everyone wakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;bills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>\n&gt;else&#39;s house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your son could probably help pay the bills, my son loves putting together<br/>\nthe budget. He is a great help to me with that, and he never forgets any of<br/>\nthe little things that I tend to forget.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Cyberdoula@xxx.xxx","from":"Cyberdoula@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"Sg9iejQJG0r8KJZM1IgJwmQRcX8_do6g1SWnWJKtZLJldsLkisEzcGgmqyRKMpXpklGkikzw8udG","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I just jumped off a cliff....and it feels so right.

In fact, I had this very <br/>\nconversation with another mom just down the hall from my son, Wesley&#39;s, 3rd <br/>\ngrade classroom.  She and I were discussing how much the school had &quot;gone <br/>\ndown hill&quot; since all the political changes at headquarters started 2 years <br/>\nago (they want better test scores by the year 2000).

What are your <br/>\nexperiences and how have you coped with having a toddler in the house?<br/>\n<br/>\n-How do you find/make time for yourself if you are with the kids all the <br/>\ntime.  I currently find it very challenging finding time just to pay the <br/>\nbills let alone make time for myself without taking my daughter to someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s house.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested, here is our story:<br/>\n<br/>\nI hated public school.  My parents put me into Kindergarten when I was 4 yo <br/>\nbecause I was very verbal.  By 3rd grade I was reading at a middle school <br/>\nlevel but couldn&#39;t get the math.  I repeated 3rd grade and felt like a <br/>\nfailure in general because of this experience.  Finally, when I was about 30 <br/>\nyo I took a college algebra class and aced it.  My self esteem improved in <br/>\nthe math area but what a waste of 20 some odd years of self esteem.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s experience was very positive during the grade school years.  He <br/>\nattended a magnet school much like the one we put Wes into before all the <br/>\npolitical changes started happening.  After that he went into the regular <br/>\nsystem and didn&#39;t like it very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of our experiences my dh, Jeff and I found the most alternative grade <br/>\nschool in our school district and the most alternative teachers in that <br/>\nschool.  We wanted our son&#39;s school experience to be a positive one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess Wes started complaining 2 years ago.  With the birth of his sister he <br/>\nsaid that he wanted to stay home.  I thought it was just because he wanted to <br/>\nbe home with us (I became a SAHM).  He had been in daycare since he was 2 1/2 <br/>\nmo (no flames please).  We really needed the money. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think it started at the end of first grade.  Summer came and things <br/>\nwere better.  Second grade started and he complained every now and then but <br/>\nnothing to cause alarm or maybe I was too absorbed in baby duties to notice.  <br/>\nIn October of his 3rd grade year I was in a car accident and so my otherwise <br/>\nfree time suddenly focused on getting treatment for my injurys.  All this <br/>\nschool year he has become more and more vocal about not wanting to go to <br/>\nschool.  He has also lost all interest in studying snakes and bugs like he <br/>\nenjoyed in the past and he has become more obnoxious in general.  It&#39;s been a <br/>\nchallenging year for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWednesday, May 12, I had a Dr. appt.  I had to drop Wes at school by 8:15, <br/>\ndrop Mara off at her baby-sitter&#39;s at 8:45 so I could make it to my appt. by <br/>\n9:30.  Well, Wes complained that he wanted to come with me, I said no and to <br/>\nmake a long story short his teacher had to physically hold him to keep him <br/>\nfrom running out of the building.  I took Mara to her baby-sitters and <br/>\ncanceled my appt.  I went back and took Wes out for &quot;coffee&quot;.  I asked him <br/>\nwhat was happening for him and he asked me for a piece of paper and a pen.  I <br/>\nobliged and he proceed to draw me pie charts to explain why he hated school <br/>\nso much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I had my listening face on, in my mind my jaw had dropped to the <br/>\nfloor and I realized that something just didn&#39;t make sense.  Here is a nine <br/>\nyo child telling me why he hates school using pie charts and fractions.  Math <br/>\nand PE got whole pies because he really likes those subjects.  Art got only <br/>\n1/8 of a pie.  I decided that this was a good time to go look at other <br/>\nschools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called another elementary school that 2 moms had recommended to see if we <br/>\ncould come visit.  The receptionist said that we could but that it would be <br/>\nbetter to wait until June because things would be more settled then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had heard about a place called the Home School Connections Center so I took <br/>\nWesley there.  We walked in the building and Wes stayed in the lobby stating <br/>\nthat he didn&#39;t want to be homeschooled.  I said &quot;Fine, you can stay out here <br/>\nbut I&#39;m going in cause I want to see what it&#39;s all about.&quot;  He stayed in the <br/>\nlobby for a few minutes and then was enticed in by the woman who is in <br/>\ncharge.  She encouraged him to pick a computer game and have fun (he chose <br/>\nOregon Trail II).  Meanwhile, I went in and was introduced to an Unschooling <br/>\nmom.  She encouraged me to read Dumbing Us Down, The Unschooling Handbook and <br/>\n&quot;anything by Holt&quot;.  They invited me to their open house which was, by <br/>\nchance, the next evening.  I went and was really excited by what they had to <br/>\noffer.  The next morning Wesley told Jeff he wanted to be home schooled!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor two weeks I read and visited Wesley&#39;s classroom a different time each <br/>\nday.  I discovered that my son is basically bored and his teacher spends most <br/>\nof her time doing crowd control over her class of 28.  Although I really like <br/>\nhis teacher&#39;s philosophy I believe she is not allowed to teach the way she <br/>\nwants.  She has too many kids, no support, and mandates from up above to <br/>\nimprove test scores.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve made it this far, thank you for listening.  I am open to anything <br/>\nanyone wants to share.  My biggest reason for not homeschooling in the past <br/>\nwas because I was afraid I&#39;d &quot;ruin&quot; my child.  After seeing and reading about <br/>\nwhat&#39;s really going on I figure I can&#39;t do any worse than the public schools <br/>\nso I&#39;m gonna give it my best shot!  So here I am a one week old convert who <br/>\nhas just taken a giant leap.
