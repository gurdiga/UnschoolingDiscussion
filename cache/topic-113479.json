My name is Theresa and I have a daughter who is 9 years old.  Usually she is very <br/>\nmuch the introvert but lately she has been showing more confidence.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that interested me in the going back to school post Sandra made was the comment about friendships.  For a long time I have been pining for homeschooling or unschooling friendships.  I find with a lot of friendships my daughter and I have there is a lot of disagreemant regarding bedtimes, sugar, learning to read, respect etc.  The list goes on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut lately I&#39;ve been feeling staying with just unschooled friends is very limiting.  I feel like we are living in a segregated world that we are keeping ourselves trapped in.
