It is not like western opera at all.  The stage was<br/>\nset simply with a square carpet for the actors area to perform.  The<br/>\nbackdrop was a sort of silk screen with a large fabric grass plant, flower<br/>\nand chinese letters on the screen.  The only props used were a table, chair<br/>\nand a few martial arts weapons.  They performed 4 pieces from different<br/>\nplays.  These pieces are very ancient...some being from the time of the<br/>\n1400&#39;s!  The actors in chinese opera begin their training at the age of 10.<br/>\nThese young children are picked from thousands of applicants.  Their day<br/>\nbegins at 5am and ends at night after rehearsals.  At age 18 they finish<br/>\ntheir training and some never become actors but perhaps stagehands, prop<br/>\ndesigners, etc.  The description of their training by our friend and leading<br/>\nchinese scholar in chinese theater was that it was akin to ballet, martial<br/>\narts, and singing.  It is a very ancient tradition and there are set pieces<br/>\nthat traditionally are performed.  We saw Kunju opera which is apparently<br/>\nmore sophisticated and refined than some other types of chinese opera.  The<br/>\ncostumes were gorgeous with bright colors of silk and many layered in some<br/>\ncases.  They had an interesting way of walking...a quick sort of<br/>\nrunning...which made the actors appear to almost float.  We sat with some<br/>\nfriends from the wushu center...they are chinese.  When we were done and<br/>\nwere all walking to the car we said we had wished we knew chinese to<br/>\nunderstand the words.  They didn&#39;t understand it either apparently.  The way<br/>\nthat the words are spoken or sung are elongated and executed with many high<br/>\npitched sounds.  Some of it sounded almost screetchy.  But, it was beautiful<br/>\nto watch and I admired the extensive training that these people had gone<br/>\nthrough for their art form.<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6324,"nextTopicId":6209}}
