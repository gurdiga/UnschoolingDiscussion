In general, though, colleges and universities<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard of over the years are accepting things like<br/>\nACT, SAT, letters from the parent and student<br/>\nexplaining the homeschool experience, and are not<br/>\nrequiring records such as a grade point average.  My<br/>\nfirst daughter took her GED at 18, then her ACT, then<br/>\nplacement tests at the local community college (which<br/>\noften are required of a student from any background). <br/>\nWe submitted her FAFSA, too.  Her tuition was paid for<br/>\nand she worked part-time to help with other expenses. <br/>\nThe GED teacher at our local high school gave her the<br/>\npre-tests and information of the ACT, etc..  My<br/>\ndaughter was encouraged to take the GED cold, without<br/>\nany classes, and she passed just fine the first time,<br/>\neven though she&#39;d never been in a classroom setting or<br/>\nhad any kind of testing.  She had no problem with the<br/>\nACT, either, and enjoyed attending college classes. <br/>\nShe preferred to work full-time after two years,<br/>\ninstead of transferring to the university.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nDiana<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!
