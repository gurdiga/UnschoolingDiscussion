It&#39;s a Question and Answer  <br/>\ncollection called The Unschooling Philosophy.  Some of it has been  <br/>\ntranslated into German (and there&#39;s a link there).  Some of you have  <br/>\nseen it, but it&#39;s worth a second and third look.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople on this list (google or yahoo) are somewhat familiar with Joyce  <br/>\nFetteroll&#39;s writings, Pam Sorooshian&#39;s and mine.   In January 2010, in  <br/>\nSanta Fe, the three of us (and our families) will be all in one place,  <br/>\nin a leisurely fashion, for several days.   Details on that will  <br/>\nappear gradually here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/\">http://santafeunschoolingsymposium.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that Schuyler Waynforth, her husband and children will  <br/>\nbe there too.   Because of unschooling ideas, David Waynforth is  <br/>\nstudying children and food, and if they&#39;re able to be there, we can  <br/>\nhear some of what he&#39;s discovered and deciphered.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s too early to make reservations, but it&#39;s not too early to think  <br/>\nabout it and maybe save some money.   For families interested in  <br/>\nskiing or snowboarding, we&#39;ll be down the road from Ski Santa Fe.   <br/>\nIt&#39;s not a huge venue, but each family attending will have a condo  <br/>\nwith a fireplace and a kitchen with dishes and all, so restaurant  <br/>\nmeals won&#39;t be necessary, although we&#39;ll have communal dinners, and  <br/>\none will be a potluck.  Families can share a condo, and there&#39;s not a  <br/>\nlimit of people per unit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a great gathering for beginning unschoolers, nor for families  <br/>\nwith very young children.   There are other things perfect for such  <br/>\nfamilies, though--the September conference in San Diego; the water  <br/>\npark gathering in Ohio in February.   But for those who are interested  <br/>\nin the philosophy and science of unschooling, my little symposium in  <br/>\nSanta Fe could be rewarding and memorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who receive this twice, feel free to stir up either of these  <br/>\ndiscussion lists!  (And sorry for the duplication.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113193,"nextTopicId":113195}}
