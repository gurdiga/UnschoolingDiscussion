I found this <br/>\narticle today.  While it is definately worth any price compared to a missing <br/>\nchild it sounded expensive to me.  Maybe once it has been around longer it <br/>\nwill get more affordable.  $300 per child + a monthly subscription fee which <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t say how much it would be, YIKES!<br/>\n<br/>\nTonya<br/>\nBrittany & Melody&#39;s Mommy<br/>\n4/22/99    12/01/01<br/>\n<br/>\nA Device to Track Missing People<br/>\nBy SABRA CHARTRAND<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Samantha Runion, Danielle van Dam and Elizabeth Short were snatched <br/>\nfrom their homes, parents everywhere shared the dread and sense of <br/>\nhelplessness of the girls&#39; families. How do you find a child who has simply <br/>\nvanished at the hands of a stranger?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is at times impossible. But technology does exist that can pinpoint a <br/>\nperson&#39;s location using orbiting satellites. Now an inventor who originally <br/>\nwanted to tap the global positioning satellite system to find her runaway <br/>\ndog has won several patents for applying her idea to following and finding <br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer Durst, a single mother from Oyster Bay, N.Y., and two partners have <br/>\npatented a lightweight, portable G.P.S. transceiver that she says is <br/>\ndesigned to be &quot;form-fitted into a backpack, a baseball hat or a belt,&quot; for <br/>\nexample. Ms. Durst, Eugene Fowler and Joseph McAlexander have received one <br/>\npatent for a &quot;pet locator&quot; and two more for a &quot;mobile object locator&quot; that <br/>\ncan be used to track animals or people. The Patent and Trademark Office has <br/>\nnotified them that their fourth patent has been approved, although it has <br/>\nnot been issued yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir devices can be programmed with boundaries, and if those boundaries are <br/>\nexceeded, the devices send messages directly to a cellphone, pager, two-way <br/>\npersonal assistant, traditional phone or even an e-mail address. Those <br/>\nmessages are followed by continuously updated geographic information, she <br/>\nsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Up until now, a G.P.S. device could tell you where you are,&quot; Ms. Durst <br/>\nexplained last week, just days after her latest patent was issued. &quot;But it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t tell me where you are. What I&#39;ve done is make it, `Now tell me <br/>\ndirectly where you are.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I hope we don&#39;t get to the point where our kids have to sleep in their own <br/>\nhomes with this,&quot; she added. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about the negative association that <br/>\ncomes with the news of these poor abducted children. I had hoped this would <br/>\nbe a warm, fuzzy application, a way for parents to feel better at an <br/>\namusement park.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, she said she could envision it being used several ways � &quot;if <br/>\nmy daughter was playing on her bike in front of the house or out in the <br/>\nyard.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA parent would program the perimeter of the yard or neighborhood into Ms. <br/>\nDurst&#39;s gadget. Those coordinates could be changed or updated at any time. <br/>\nIf the child went for a walk with a parent, the adult could use a password <br/>\nto suspend the boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the person wearing the gadget leaves the specified perimeter, an alert <br/>\nis sent to a designated two-way radio device. Location information follows <br/>\nin the form of text, figures, graphics or numbers, and is updated every few <br/>\nseconds, in effect following a person down a street, through a neighborhood <br/>\nor around an amusement park.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It could say, `Elvis has left the building,&#39; &quot; Ms. Durst explained, &quot;and <br/>\nwould update the location until the pet or person is recovered.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the tracking system is removed for any reason, an alert and last known <br/>\nlocation are transmitted. Ms. Durst said she also designed a model that <br/>\nincorporates a &quot;panic button&quot; so someone in distress can send their own <br/>\nalarm about their location.<br/>\n<br/>\nMs. Durst said she designed the system to notify the person back at the home <br/>\nbase directly. Other G.P.S. systems send data to a central computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t want to have to contact a call center,&quot; she explained. &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to wait online to find out where my kid is.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe device weighs about seven ounces, though Ms. Durst said she hoped it <br/>\nwould become smaller as the technology advanced. It runs on a rechargeable <br/>\nbattery and picks up its G.P.S. signals with a flat, patchlike antenna.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though abductions by strangers � like those of the Runion, Van Damm and <br/>\nShort girls � are rare, countless children are temporarily lost every year <br/>\nin crowded amusement parks, at the beach and in shopping malls. Adults are <br/>\nalso often lost in a variety of ways, too: Alzheimer&#39;s patients sometimes <br/>\nwander off, hikers and mountain climbers disappear in the wilderness, <br/>\nsoldiers go missing in action. Ms. Durst says any of these people could be <br/>\ntracked with precision if only they were linked to the G.P.S. system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea actually started with her dog.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;About three years ago, I was searching for my lost dog in the pouring <br/>\nrain,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I&#39;m a divorced mom with two kids at home, and I had an <br/>\ninvisible fence, but my dog would just break through it. I had the choice of <br/>\nonce again piling the kids in the car at night to look for the dog, or <br/>\nleaving the kids at home alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Needless to say, I put the kids in the car and drove around in the rain, <br/>\nwith everyone crying over the dog,&quot; she said. Her search made her think <br/>\nabout the tracking system called LoJack that many people install in their <br/>\ncars. &quot;I thought, there&#39;s LoJack for cars, so we should have LoDog,&quot; <br/>\nrecalled Ms. Durst, who did not find the dog until the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith two partners, Ms. Durst began work on a pet locator, a lightweight and <br/>\nprogrammable receiver-transmitter that used the G.P.S. and could be embedded <br/>\nin a dog&#39;s collar.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;After the initial application for the pet locator, the other applications <br/>\nbecame obvious,&quot; Ms. Durst said.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and her partners have several prototypes, including one that is part of <br/>\na child&#39;s fanny pack and could be rented to parents at amusement parks like <br/>\nDisney World, and one for the military that she said &quot;will send the location <br/>\nof a soldier directly to a platoon leader or to each other.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe hopes that at the very least, her invention will mean &quot;you&#39;ll never see <br/>\nthose `Lost Dog&#39; signs again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system for tracking children or adults is not available for sale yet, <br/>\neven though Ms. Durst and her partners have a Web site at www.gpstracks.com <br/>\nthat offers information about the dog-finding collar. Ms. Durst estimated <br/>\nthe system would cost about $300, plus a monthly subscription fee. She and <br/>\nher fellow inventors, Eugene Fowler and Joseph McAlexander, have won three <br/>\npatents: the pet locator is 6, 172, 640, and the &quot;mobile object locator&quot; <br/>\nreceived 6,236,358 and 6,421,001.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe secret to life isn&#39;t getting what you want it&#39;s wanting it once you get <br/>\nit-Katherine Hepburn in &quot;Love Affair&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember starting the fire is easy, the hardest part is learning how to keep <br/>\nthe flame-Stevie Nicks &quot;Love&#39;s A Hard Game To Play&quot; Timespace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40783,"nextTopicId":40811}}
