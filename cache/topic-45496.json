I understand where you&#39;re coming from, in<br/>\nmy own life we take many of the same measures that your family does to allow<br/>\nme to stay at home and for us to live on one income. But, many people, even if<br/>\nthey did take those measures and saved their money, would still not have<br/>\nenough income or the option of letting one of the parents stay home with the<br/>\nchildren. And sometimes, it is the hours worked, or the type of work, or the<br/>\ninsurance options that limit two parent families options. I could go on and<br/>\non. I have five siblings. Four of them were laid off in the last year with<br/>\nthis recession. What about high costs for living and food is going through the<br/>\nroof? Millions of people don&#39;t have the money or access to basic health<br/>\ninsurance.

Their &quot;school&quot; did only go thru the 8th grade, but they continued learning via apprenticeship in their chosen field after that. The Menonites also had the option of furthering their education via correspondence courses for both high school and college. They could all read, write, and did math every bit as well as I. Those who chose to become farriers, learned by working with the current farrier(s), those who chose to become lay midwives did so by doing it right along with the current lay midwives. They had a much better education in their chosen field by age 18 than most college graduates have. Plus every one of them learns to farm properly (including the rotation and conservation of land), to build houses and barns and roads and bridges, to tend children, to cook and clean, to identify and use dozens (if not hundreds) of plants and herbs, to take care of livestock, and basic first aid. That&#39;s far above what the majority of college graduates, or even people in general learn in their entire lifetime. All of that doesn&#39;t even mention that they also learn the Bible word for word, and are the most compassionate and loving people I&#39;ve ever had the fortune to meet. <br/>\nMyranda<br/>\n  By what criteria?

I&#39;ve always been a fan of the one-room schoolhouses. Personally, I&#39;d love to see each community or neighborhood with one of these, with a teacher from that neighborhood, and the parents all chip in and pay for their children&#39;s supplies and whatever they can afford to the teacher. If there are a few more well-to-do people there, they could get &quot;extras&quot; put in like a small gym. This probably would not work in large cities, but in smaller towns it could work perfectly, IMO.
