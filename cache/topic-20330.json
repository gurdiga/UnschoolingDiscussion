I love where I live, I have a wonderful <br/>\nneighborhood<br/>\n&gt;   of awesome neighbors (example: brought us a hot homecooked meal <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt;   a basket when we were moving in, have block party barbecues - most<br/>\n&gt;   are homeschoolers - AWESOME nrighborhood .... )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   BUT ... I am moving out of here this summer most likely :<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Reason being : Pierce county is going nuts on raising rates<br/>\n&gt;   Our rent is a mere $1400 a mo ... not a biggie - pretty typical <br/>\n&gt;   and actually a very wonderful price for the beautiful home we <br/>\n&gt;   have by the water, with 4 bedrooms, 3 bath, hot tub - huge <br/>\nfloorplan etc<br/>\n&gt;   ....<br/>\n&gt;   BUT .... when you add on w/s/g/gas and power<br/>\n&gt;   it is costing us over $2000 a mo and keeps going higher ...<br/>\n&gt;   we have gas heat and conserve on energy more than a lot of people<br/>\n&gt;   but each bill the rates are higher<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   and car tabs in pierce and king county are so much higher<br/>\n&gt;   my car is 10 yrs newer than my hubbys but registered in whatcom <br/>\ncounty <br/>\n&gt;   not pierce hubby registered his in pierce when we moved here<br/>\n&gt;   my tabs were 30$ his were almost $100<br/>\n&gt;   it is NUTS what they tax you on and raise down here that they <br/>\ndont in<br/>\n&gt;   other areas of WA state ... Hubby is askin his work to let him <br/>\ntelecommute<br/>\n&gt;   so<br/>\n&gt;   we can go back to whatcom county where the air rating is the <br/>\nhighest for<br/>\n&gt;   the country<br/>\n&gt;   (saw that on CNN the other night) and it is cheap to live ... <br/>\n&gt;   Just a heads up for some more things to think about ...<br/>\n&gt;   skagit, kitsap, thurston, mason and whatcom counties and across <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;   mountains<br/>\n&gt;   are the cheapest areas to live in WA<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   ~ Childhood is that state which ends<br/>\n&gt;   the moment a puddle is first viewed<br/>\n&gt;   as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. ~<br/>\n&gt;   - Kathy Williams -<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!
