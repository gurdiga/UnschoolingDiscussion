Swimmies add to that danger. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joylyn, I have to respectfully disagree with you on this one. I think <br/>\n(as with so many things) it depends on the child. Some kids never <br/>\nhave any kind of safe attitude towards water, and swimmies can make <br/>\nit safer for these kinds of kids. My daughter as a toddler would go <br/>\nover to the deep end and just throw herself in (this was before she <br/>\never had any kind of floatie device). Just because she sank to the <br/>\nbottom and we had to plunge in and pull her out *every* time did not <br/>\ndeter her at all! Getting a floatie for her to wear was great. We <br/>\nstill watched her, of course, but now we had at least some time to <br/>\nget to her before she was on the bottom of the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat little boy that you saved might not have jumped into the deep <br/>\nend *because* he thought he could swim, based on the fact that he was <br/>\nwearing a floatie device. Maybe he was just the kind of kid that <br/>\nhabitually threw himself in the deep end and that&#39;s the reason his <br/>\nmom had him in a floatie. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think floaties are a tool. They can really help in some situations, <br/>\nthey can hinder in others. Just like a spatula can be used to flip <br/>\neggs or whack someone over the head. For our son, he was always so <br/>\ncautious around the water, he never wore a floatie. Then when he <br/>\nwanted to try to swim but was very scared of not being able to touch <br/>\nthe bottom, a floatie gave him more confidence to try the water out. <br/>\nHe wore it for a matter of months, then could swim. For our daughter <br/>\nthe daredevil, we&#39;ve had a floatie on her since she could toddle (and <br/>\nhurl herself into the deep end time after time). Now she&#39;s taking it <br/>\noff for periods of time and swimming without it. I think it&#39;s been a <br/>\nsafe thing in her case, it wasn&#39;t necessary in my son&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other anecdote - I was at a lake with friends 2 years ago and <br/>\ntheir toddler ran straight into the water. There was a big drop-off <br/>\nand she started going down. Luckily, one of the moms dashed into the <br/>\nwater and caught her. Again, another child (like mine!) who seemed to <br/>\nknow no fear around water. She tried to do it again later. The mom <br/>\nended up putting her in a floatie the rest of the summer when we were <br/>\nat the lake. If nothing else, when she ran into the water, she&#39;d <br/>\nfloat long enough for someone to get to her, instead of sinking into <br/>\nthe murk. I know for a fact that in her situation a floatie was the <br/>\nfarthest thing from dangerous. I think it really depends on how <br/>\nthey&#39;re used. The best safety device is a parent who pays attention <br/>\nto their child!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7143857,"authorName":"jrossedd@aol.com","from":"jrossedd@...","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Swimming and Unschooling - Anything to Share?","postDate":"1083500406","msgId":93336,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDguNGJmYTRjOTQuMmRjNjQxNzZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":93335,"nextInTopic":93341,"prevInTime":93335,"nextInTime":93337,"topicId":93301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It never occurred to me to do so <br/>\nfor safety&#39;s sake. He loves loves loves water, and to swim. I don&#39;t <br/>\neven know if he CAN swim, but he hasnt drowned yet. I think swimming <br/>\nis on his list of most favorite things in the world. The apt we just <br/>\nmoved to has a pool, my sisters apt has a pool, my other brothers apt <br/>\nhas a pool, and there is a community pool. But where he developed his <br/>\nlove for swimming is at hotels. His paternal grandmother is a <br/>\nhistorian and travels everywhere and seamus goes with her alot(either <br/>\nwith his dad or myself.) Everywhere he has every stayed (with the <br/>\nexception of London)he has been in a hotel with a pool. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried water wings (referred to on the list as swimmies i guess? or <br/>\nis that something different?)once, and they were really <br/>\nuncomfortable, and affected his balance in a weird way. So when he <br/>\nwas little he would just hang onto me or his dad. And when he was oh <br/>\nprobably four or so we got one of those floating kick boards and that <br/>\nwas great because he could go the length of the pool but also let go <br/>\nif he wanted to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the amusement park in cincy there is a huge &quot;wave pool&quot;, i went <br/>\nwith a close friend, her baby, her son who is a year younger than <br/>\nseamus, and seamus. While her son was still trying to get past the <br/>\nfirst wave (he was scared), i couldnt even *find* seamus. Finally <br/>\nnoticed him waaaaay off near the deeper end. It was a little scary to <br/>\nhave lost him(helps that he has flaming red hair), but he was totally <br/>\nfine doing somersaults in the water. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a swim club here, and i think that might be more along <br/>\nthe lines of what he would want rather than &quot;lessons&quot;, i think i&#39;ll <br/>\ncheck that out too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think much of the skills seamus has learned, he has learned by <br/>\n&quot;doing.&quot; He was never taught how to ride a bike, he basically jumped <br/>\non and there he went. Other kids might be more comfortable with <br/>\nlessons, if they don&#39;t naturally take to water. <br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Swimming and Unschooling - Anything to Share?","postDate":"1083477882","msgId":93325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRjLjk2MmIwZDkuMmRjNWU5N2FAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":93324,"nextInTopic":93326,"prevInTime":93324,"nextInTime":93326,"topicId":93301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/1/2004 10:26:14 PM Mountain Daylight Time, joylyn@earthlink.net writes: I just found a bunch of links from very reputable sources","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1056168410\">In a message dated 5/1/2004 10:26:14 PM Mountain Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI just found a bunch of links from very reputable sources indicating <br/>\nswimmies are dangerous.

Besides, of course, the manufacturer of those items. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have known children personally who have drowned in back yard pools. More<br/>\n&gt; than half of those children had swimming lessons and learned how to <br/>\n&gt; float if<br/>\n&gt; they ever fell into a pool. I certainly wouldn&#39;t make a statement about<br/>\n&gt; lessons being dangerous and giving a false sense of security to anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually, I would make that statement.  I think that swim lessons do <br/>\nmake some kids feel more confident than they truly are, and that can <br/>\ncause them to get into a situation where drowning could happen.  The <br/>\nonly thing that can prevent drowning is parent watching, and even then <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t always work.  I&#39;ll never forget the story of the little <br/>\ngirl who drowned a few years ago in the hot tub, with her mom right <br/>\nthere.  The mom had some sort of seizure or something, and blacked out.  <br/>\nBaby died. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I<br/>\n&gt; would state that no matter what the circumstances were, children should be<br/>\n&gt; watched by a pool or any kind of water.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is exactly my point.  I have no doubt that Krusula is absolutely <br/>\nwatching her children all the time, and that their pool is as safe is <br/>\npossible, but accidents happen.  And parents who rely upon swimmies to <br/>\nhelp their children learn to swim are doing a great disservice to their <br/>\nchildren.  Water is dangerous, no child is water safe, no adult is water <br/>\nsafe.  Lessons are not a guarantee that children will not drown.  Even <br/>\nparents watching is not a guarantee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; None of my kids ever thought they could swim just because they had their<br/>\n&gt; swimmies on.

I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that thousands and thousands of children each day wear swimmies <br/>\nand few die.

And<br/>\nshe has always loved the water. Before fully getting into unschooling, she<br/>\ndid take some lessons from a nice enough lady who came to our house. We had<br/>\ncome back from our 4 months in Texas, so it was when Jayn was 2.5. She had<br/>\nbeen using a vest type floaty with front and back pockets containing sheets<br/>\nof foam that you could sequentially remove as the child&#39;s proficiency<br/>\nincreased. I had gotten down to about half of them by the time Jayn<br/>\ndispensed with this item entirely.<br/>\nThe teacher focused on getting Jayn to put her face under the water (to say<br/>\nhello to the plastic toys) and to get her to float holding on to a broom<br/>\nstick, without floaties. Jayn would decide when the lesson was over, and<br/>\nquite liked Joy. I guess the main idea was about floating, but I didn&#39;t see<br/>\nany &quot;progress&quot; towards swimming. Of course Jayn was so willing to get her<br/>\nface wet, jump in, splash herself and whoever she was playing with, outside<br/>\nof the lessons. I never really felt the lessons were much good, and I<br/>\nwatched every one from above expecting to gain some insight into how I could<br/>\nhelp Jayn learn to swim enough to be safe if she fell in - didn&#39;t happen.<br/>\nConstant vigilance is what we practice around our pool. <br/>\nThe following summer Jayn and our neighbors simply played in the pool. (Jayn<br/>\nbeing 3.5) In the course of those few months all three kids went from<br/>\nfloaties to no floaties of any kind. I would ask Jayn if she wanted hers,<br/>\nand usually she would start with her vest on, and then have me take it off.<br/>\nJonah, just a few months older than Jayn is a fantastic natural swimmer -<br/>\ndiving to the bottom of the deep end to retrieve tocks and toys. Renee is so<br/>\nmuch taller (2 years older) that she was on her tip toes while Jayn and<br/>\nJonah were forced to dog paddle. They also did a lot of leaping into my arms<br/>\nin the water. She could dogpaddle the length of the pool - 25 ft - and a few<br/>\nstrokes underwater.<br/>\nI had to ask the neighbor&#39;s aunt to stop repeating to Jayn to keep her mouth<br/>\nclosed to not swallow water - not wanting Jayn&#39;s enjoyment destroyed just<br/>\nbecause Aunt can&#39;t let go of trying to control her family. I also had to be<br/>\nin the water with Jonah and Jayn, because sometimes he would get rough and<br/>\nwant to pull Jayn under - and she was sometimes scared of him. <br/>\nShe still swims and insists on going in the water even now before the heater<br/>\nis turned on and it is very cold - and sometimes in her clothes.

I just <br/>\nspent four hours at the pool, and I was the ONLY parent there who never <br/>\nstopped watching the pool.  One parent came with a non-swimming 9ish <br/>\ngirl, and promptly went to sleep.  There was a party in the clubhouse <br/>\nnext to the pool, and I was the ONLY adult outside, all other adults <br/>\nwere inside the clubhouse.  There were probably 15 kids, ages 4-15 in <br/>\nthe pool from the party.  I was the one who rescued the 6ish child who <br/>\ngot out beyond his ability to walk and almost drowned, with his finger <br/>\ntips 3 inches from being able to reach the side. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think that there are some parents, maybe even many parents, who <br/>\ncan use inherently dangerous devices like swimmies and walkers, and <br/>\ntheir kids grow up fine.  But that does not negate the idea that <br/>\nswimmies are dangerous.  All it takes is ten seconds next to water and a <br/>\nchild can drown.  A few years ago I rescued a four year old.  He was <br/>\nwearing swimmies. He had spent an hour in the pool, while his mother <br/>\ntalked on the phone and read and slept next to the pool.  The child was <br/>\nall over the pool, in the deep end, etc.  To him, HE COULD SWIM!  Cause, <br/>\nin his swimmies, he could.   His mom was getting him ready to go,  had <br/>\ntaken off his swimmies, and turned around to gather their items.  Her <br/>\nphone rang so she answered it.  In the mean time her child had jumped <br/>\nback into the deep end.  He could swim well there a few minutes ago, why <br/>\nnot now?  I jumped in after him, dragged him from the bottom, and had <br/>\nhim out of the pool before his mom realized he was in the pool.  Sure, <br/>\nshe was,w ell, not attentive, but I don&#39;t watch my kids every second.  <br/>\nNot all pools are safe.  Your child could be with a neighbor or a <br/>\nfriend&#39;s parent who doesn&#39;t watch as closely.  There are lots of ifs, <br/>\nand children die every year because of pools and water. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a walker too.  We watched our child in it, and we knew it was <br/>\ndangerous, but we used it anyway.  We made a choice to do so.  If you <br/>\nwant to use swimmies, fine.  But, you should know, they are dangerous.  <br/>\nThey give the child a sense of power in the water they don&#39;t really have. <br/>\n<br/>\nWater is dangerous.  Swimmies add to that danger. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nMary wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: &quot;joylyn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Mary<br/>\n&gt; Swimmies are dangerous.

She was 5-6 at the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; With my younger kids, my SIL was always, every year, informing me about<br/>\n&gt; swimming lessons at a local high school pool. From the time Joseph was<br/>\nborn,<br/>\n&gt; she was telling me about the lessons. When the kids were old enough to<br/>\n&gt; understand, I would ask them if they wanted to go. They never did. And<br/>\nevery<br/>\n&gt; time I saw my SIL at my other SIL&#39;s house, where there was a pool and our<br/>\n&gt; kids were in with their swimmies, she would tell me, AGAIN, about the<br/>\n&gt; lessons.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never learned to swim until I was 14.

Neither <br/>\nof them are taking swimming lessons now. DS (7.5) didn&#39;t even set a <br/>\nfoot in the water until almost 5. He has some pretty serious sensory <br/>\nissues, so of course we didn&#39;t push that one. Once he did go in, he <br/>\nwas swimming within a year. He&#39;s a great natural swimmer, though we <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have known it from his early reactions. DD (4.5)has been a <br/>\nwater hound since day 1 (well, both kids were water births, so really <br/>\nsince day 1!). We went to Hawaii when she was 4 months old and I took <br/>\nher in the pool there. After that, all vacation long, whenever we <br/>\nwalked by the pool at the hotel she would screech and reach her arms <br/>\ntowards the water. That interest has never waned, she always wants to <br/>\ngo swimming. Interestingly, she&#39;s just now starting to swim without a <br/>\nfloatie - at about the same age that DS did (who rarely set foot in a <br/>\npool before that). So the amount of exposure to water didn&#39;t make <br/>\nthat big of a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, I have read of studies where they showed that <br/>\nthe single biggest influence on whether a child became a great <br/>\nswimmer when they were older was the amount of time that they <br/>\n*played* in the water (especially deeper water like ponds or lakes, <br/>\nwhere they had to tread water). Playing around in the water gives a <br/>\nperson a great feel for how to move water with their hands and feet - <br/>\nsomething good swimmers just seem to know instinctively.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an a swim instructor and coach who teaches a class of adult <br/>\nswimmers, I can tell you that most people do not learn how to swim <br/>\nwell from the swim lessons that they take as children. Most <br/>\ntechniques that swim instructors use on young children are incorrect <br/>\nand will actually stand them poorly later on when they have to try <br/>\nand change these bad habits (unfortunately, I&#39;m the one trying to <br/>\nhelp them break these bad habits, and it&#39;s hard!!!). Most swim <br/>\nteachers who teach kids swimming aren&#39;t excellent swimmers <br/>\nthemselves. Now personally, it would make little sense for me to hire <br/>\nsomething like a violin teacher who didn&#39;t play well. But <br/>\nsurprisingly, many people do this for swimming. The swim teacher that <br/>\nmy kids had, they really liked. Also, I saw her swimming all the <br/>\ntime, even when she wasn&#39;t teaching (actually, she&#39;s the only one out <br/>\nof all of the instructors where I work that I regularly see actually <br/>\nswimming by herself). I thought she was a good match for both <br/>\nreasons. At a certain point, each of the kids wanted to quit lessons, <br/>\nso they did, but I do have a personal requirement that they learn <br/>\nwater safety - enough skills to keep themselves safe in the water - <br/>\nfor me, that stems from my experience as a lifeguard, having to, on a <br/>\ncouple of occasions, save children who didn&#39;t have good water safety <br/>\nskills. They&#39;ve chosen to do that with me right now. That&#39;s been our <br/>\nexperience so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Swimming and Unschooling - Anything to Share?","postDate":"1083456937","msgId":93312,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3MWVqOSsyYjN2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNkLjNkZWVmMzQyLjJkYzU2ZDdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":93310,"nextInTopic":93315,"prevInTime":93311,"nextInTime":93313,"topicId":93301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmmm.

Kids who use them are most likely to drown, in my <br/>\nopinion.  They do not understand how their body reacts with and floats <br/>\nin water.  If they ever did fall in without their floaties they would be <br/>\nunable to deal with the water, as they would feel different in the water <br/>\nwithout the swimmies. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls were both strong swimmers before the age of four.  Janene could <br/>\nswim at 9 months, no lessons, just put her int he water and she swam.  <br/>\nLexie was 18 months when she first went in, and she was also a natural <br/>\nswimmer.  Their early lessons were simply being in the water with mommy <br/>\nor daddy and other babies, playing and learning important things like <br/>\n&quot;fall in, turn around immediatley&quot;  (Children drown because they fall in <br/>\nand see the other side of the pool and try to get to it, never realizing <br/>\nthat if they simply turned around the edge would be within an arms <br/>\nlength.)  I think young babies often are natural swimmers, and as long <br/>\nas water play continues to happen (without flotations) through out the <br/>\ntoddler and preschool years.  At nine, lexie is as water safe as can be <br/>\n(there really is no such thing) and Janene will be so in another few <br/>\nyears.  They are strong swimmers.  They never used a flotation device <br/>\nbesides a noodle, and that was for water play, not safety.  I practice <br/>\nconstant supervision, and constant swimming (hard to learn to swim if <br/>\nyou only swim every so often.)<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, Sandra, I was raised in NM and we were swimming a few times a week <br/>\nor more often, year round.  I was on swim team for a while, but even <br/>\nwhen we weren&#39;t on swim team we swam all the time.  My mother is very <br/>\ninto water, and for a whiel she and I swam every morning at 6am at the <br/>\nlocal high school.  It was a good time.

We have a pool, so <br/>\nhe gets what he needs that way.  He&#39;s had a lot of fun over the years jumping, <br/>\ntrying to swim, and, just playing in the water.  We thought we should put him <br/>\nin lessons since we got this house because the safety issue is there everyday <br/>\nbut we&#39;ve never had a reason to worry because so far we are always with the <br/>\nkids in the yard and we&#39;ve done the CPR thing, and the pool has no open access.  <br/>\nNow he has a MAJOR interest in diving and he has begun asking about taking <br/>\nlessons for that but I&#39;m not sure how young formal lessons start for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think letting them explore the water and enjoy it, that&#39;s the main thing.  <br/>\nA friend of mine was determined to make her kids safe in the water, especially <br/>\nsince we have a pool and invite them for swims, so she forces lessons on her <br/>\ntwo kids and her DD loves going in the pool (but doesn&#39;t really like her <br/>\nlessons) but her DS doesn&#39;t enjoy it at all, so when he comes over he justs plays <br/>\nin the yard.  So it&#39;s for the kids, let them decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd whether it&#39;s something in your area all-year-round or you&#39;re freezing <br/>\nyour booty off in Alaska, if the interest is there, that&#39;s what makes it <br/>\nrelevant.  There&#39;s always indoor pools.  Safety is always a concern around water but <br/>\nbeing watchful helps and instead of &quot;training&quot; a child, we can always start by <br/>\npreparing ourselves with CPR and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela<br/>\nAn unschooler in the making<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141102765,"authorName":"Mary","from":"&quot;Mary&quot; &lt;mummy124@...&gt;","profile":"mummyone24","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Swimming and Unschooling - Anything to Share?","postDate":"1083451611","msgId":93307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzEwMWM0MmZjZSQzMjE3Yjc0MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDNkLjNkZWVmMzQyLjJkYzU2ZDdjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":93306,"nextInTopic":93308,"prevInTime":93306,"nextInTime":93308,"topicId":93301,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-541615397\">From: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;As I signed 8-year-old DS up for swimming lessons today (he finally<br/>\nasked for them)  it occurred to me to ask how others here may have<br/>\nexperienced<br/>\n&quot;swimming&quot; in connection to unschooling, and since it&#39;s that time of year,<br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s on other minds besides mine? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first daughter horsed around in the pool that was at my mom&#39;s complex.<br/>\nShe always had her little swimmies and gradually asked for them not to be<br/>\nblown up all the way.

Last year we did less, because of traveling, mostly, and we were <br/>\nbusy.  Last year Lexie volunteered at the pool.  It was rather funny how <br/>\nit came about.  Lexie had seen other older kids volunteering, and wanted <br/>\nto do so.  We asked.  I was told by the very young swim instructor in <br/>\nthe office &quot;she&#39;s only eight, absolutely not, never, volunteers must be <br/>\n12.&quot;  I said &quot;are there ever any exceptions?&quot;  She said, well I guess <br/>\nthere could be if the director of that city pool said it was OK.&quot;  So I <br/>\nasked her to ask the director (whom we had known for a few years.  The <br/>\ngirl walked over to the director who is in the pool and asked, &quot;Can an <br/>\neight year old volunteer?&quot;  The director said &quot;Nope, they need to be <br/>\n12,&quot;  Then she noticed us waiting and said &quot;oh wait, are you talking <br/>\nabout Lexie volunteering.  Yeah, she can, what hours can she do this, <br/>\nand for how long?&quot;  Once she heard it was Lexie, she knew it would be <br/>\nfine!  Lexie volunteered about three hours a day, for a few weeks, <br/>\nbefore we left for our vacation.  It gave her more time in the water, <br/>\nshe was helping the level 1 swimmers, and she did great.  They assigned <br/>\nher one kid for a class who did NOT want to get in the water.  Lexie was <br/>\nloving and gentle and by the end of the two week session that child was <br/>\ngoing under the water and would only work with Lexie.  It was quite a <br/>\nwonderful thing to see. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling, to me, doesn&#39;t mean an absence of formal classes.  Instead, <br/>\nit simply means following a child&#39;s lead.  Lexie is currently involved <br/>\nin a rather formal film class, with kids from ages 9 to 18.  Guess who <br/>\nthe 9 year old is?  Yep, Lexie.  There are weekly meetings, homework, <br/>\netc. as they write dialogue, scenes, figure out what props, etc. they <br/>\nwill need, etc.  Lexie is the only girl in the group, which is fine with <br/>\nher, because the star of their movie is a girl, and of course she got <br/>\nthat part.  Even though she&#39;s the youngest, she is expected to do her <br/>\npart, just as the other kids are. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jrossedd@...\">jrossedd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;        As I signed 8-year-old DS up for swimming lessons today (he <br/>\n&gt; finally<br/>\n&gt; asked for them)  it occurred to me to ask how others here may have <br/>\n&gt; experienced<br/>\n&gt; &quot;swimming&quot; in connection to unschooling, and since it&#39;s that time of <br/>\n&gt; year,<br/>\n&gt; maybe it&#39;s on other minds besides mine?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        I have more questions and notions than answers to this.
