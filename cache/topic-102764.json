I wish we could walk a few places - store, park, library, so forth.  The city buses don&#39;t even come here.<br/>\n<br/>\nUndeveloped space in the yard.  We bought a completely landscaped home, primarily because we didn&#39;t have the time to do it ourselves when we moved here with a toddler and an infant.  It didn&#39;t take me long to realize that there was no place in the yard for kids to mess around.  As it turned out, a new development behind ours resulted in us getting an extra 2,500 sq feet of sand.  Dh thinks it would be easier if it was planted in grass, but I love our wild strip and the kids have had fun digging big holes simply for the joy of digging.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigger kitchen area.  My kitchen itself is big enough, but there is only a small dining area next to it and that is where we often end up.  So there are often piles on the kitchen table and counter that have to be cleared away for meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily room.  What were we thinking?  Guess it comes back to the kids being so small when we moved and we were in 750 sq ft. before.  This place seemed so huge that I didn&#39;t notice there wasn&#39;t some sort of family room.  Instead, the living room is the first room you walk into and it is very lived in!

Can I unschool, and live life the way I envision us living, with 5 children? Now, I know that I can, and that I will..it is just my fear that creeps up every now and then when life gets overwhelming and it feels like we&#39;re never going to get out of survival mode. I feel that after time this fear will dissipate completely, but it&#39;s still lingering now. <br/>\n <br/>\nI want to honor and do all that I can for each of children every single moment of every single day, and it frustrates me when I realize that I can&#39;t always do this. It was different when they were younger, but as my two oldest children are now 7.5 and nearly 6 they have desires that require more of me and need me to play different roles that I&#39;m just coming to figure out. I hope this makes sense.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Helping the kids have a place to watch TV or movies out of the hustle and bustle of all those other kids is a simple and very very kind and useful gift you can give them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree and I want to honor their needs/desires of what to watch and when. We will figure out how to carve out these spaces in our small home with many people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Watch, instead, for chances to support <br/>\n </span></blockquote>their needs for solitude and privacy and just quieter space to do some things - that is going to be harder to come by in your family than togetherness. The ability to get away from each other will help them get along WAY better.&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI know you&#39;re right about this. It&#39;s funny, when one of my oldest 2 goes into their rooms to listen to music or draw or something, it&#39;s not 10 minutes before the rest of the kids are knocking on their door saying &quot;are you done? can you play now? please?&quot; LOL! They&#39;ve become so used to everyone always playing together they are now going to need to understand and respect when others choose *not* to play. I can help them with this, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some kids will cope better and others will be desperate for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>space and solitude.&gt;<br/>\nDefinitely. Each one is very different with different levels of needing space. Things are best around here when I pick up on the cues of my child that can get overwhelmed easily and swoop into help *before* things get out of hand. I need to help them see how they can get their space, and make sure they have places they can go to, with me if needed, when necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; now - and then read it again and again.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I will.

My 7 1/2 yr old really likes exciting, slightly scary, kind of things and we&#39;re trying to figure out how to create a space for her to do this. Our TV and DVD player are in the main living area of our house. Our living area and kitchen are all kind of together and this is where we are the majority of the day. When somebody is watching tv there, it&#39;s difficult for the younger children to get away from it if they&#39;re scared because I&#39;m usually in this area and they want to be with me. <br/>\n <br/>\nSolutions we&#39;ve discussed are: add a dvd to the small master bedroom tv so she can watch in there, get her a tv/dvd combo for her own room (but then boys will want one in their room too, so this would really be getting two tv/dvd combos). <br/>\n <br/>\nMy only concern to adding tvs to their bedrooms is that I would prefer to watch and talk with them instead of them closing themselves up in their room to watch. But, maybe we&#39;ll still do both, especially after the novelty of having it in their room wore off?<br/>\n <br/>\nI want to give them the space to watch tv and movies as they choose, but also need our living area to be peaceful and quiet for younger children during the day.<br/>\n <br/>\nAny suggestions or comments on this one? <br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\nKristina<br/>\nMama to Caitlin (7 1/2), Liam (almost 6), Keenan (almost 4), Sophia (2), and Kira (3 months)<br/>\n<br/>\nRue Kream &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:skreams@...\">skreams@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nRowan&#39;s having a lot of fun on this site today.

Almost always roll playing with a theme, like let s play the Thunderbirds game or Harry Potter , and it goes on","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1350111032\">My kids, normally, play together very well. Almost always roll playing with a theme, like let&#39;s play the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; game or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and it goes on from there. However, in the last few months it&#39;s beginning to feel like they&#39;re not getting along as well anymore. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s mainly transition from a new baby (3 months ago) coupled with several illnesses and lousy weather, and know these problems will all be addressed in time.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy main obstacle right now is name calling. It started out here and there (and one child does it much more than the others) but it has escalated into the first way they deal with one another when they are frustrated. My husband and I of course never call names to them or one another, not even in teasing, so it&#39;s frustrating for us to see them treating one another (and us) in such a hurtful way. Though, being occupied with the baby I&#39;m not always able to be right there when a frustration begins to help them talk it out. Sometimes I&#39;m able to get there, and others I&#39;m in the other room and only hear it when it gets to the yelling, name calling level.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy child that can be &quot;explosive&quot;, is the one I have the hardest time with. Just this morning his clothes weren&#39;t dry and I was met with &quot;you didn&#39;t dry my clothes stupid mommy!&quot;. (he&#39;s nearly 6). A typical response from me would be &quot;I can see your upset that your clothes are still wet but I do not care to be spoken to like that. It&#39;s not a very effective way to get me to help you and get what you want. When your calm let&#39;s talk and we&#39;ll figure things out.&quot; Or something like that. If I try and sit down and talk with him while he&#39;s angry he&#39;ll continue calling names or it might turn into him throwing things on the floor or at me (though not as much anymore). When he&#39;s upset he needs space, and we do our talking later. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut, even with talking, seemingly all the time, about how powerful our words are and how they are not meant to be used to hurt one another and what better feeling words would be that we could use, the name calling just doesn&#39;t seem to stop! Even my 3 year old is now telling people to shut-up and calling people stupid! This has to end, I told my kids tonight that our house isn&#39;t enjoyable to be in when everybody&#39;s speaking like this, and I mean it!<br/>\n <br/>\nThey know it&#39;s my hot button and with a new baby I realize it&#39;s probably their way of getting my attention. But, it&#39;s so hard because it throws me back to all of the old stuff I was raised with and makes me feel like tossing them in their rooms for awhile so I don&#39;t have to be called names myself, or hear them do it to each other. <br/>\n <br/>\nI have to do something different, and I just don&#39;t know what. Please tell me others have been through this and that there&#39;s hope! The two main things that I have a very difficult time with  is the kids hurting one another with words or language, and hurting one another&#39;s property. And these seem to happen way too often.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo top it off, I&#39;ve got a whole extended family breathing down my neck telling me the kids are bored and they wouldn&#39;t be doing this kind of stuff if they were in school where there&#39;s some &quot;real discipline&quot;, as my dad puts it. My kids are more bored than usual right now because we&#39;re not getting out as much with the baby, the weather&#39;s been crappy and we&#39;ve been sick often over the last couple of months. I know that plays a part of the root problem, but I also need some suggestions for when it happens...in the moment. <br/>\n <br/>\nHow can I handle this in a non coercive way? <br/>\nThanks so much~<br/>\nKristina<br/>\nMama to Caitlin (71/2), Liam (almost 6), Keenan (almost 4), Sophia (2), and Kira (3 months)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"fun website","postDate":"1106674901","msgId":102764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWM1MDMwNSQyMTkzNTI3MCQ2NzAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":103064,"prevInTime":102763,"nextInTime":102765,"topicId":102764,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rowan s having a lot of fun on this site today.
