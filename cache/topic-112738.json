We bailed out<br/>\nat the last minute even though we were originally very enthused.  We<br/>\ncalled these events &quot;commitments&quot; but I think they were just simple<br/>\nordinary choices.  To use the word commitment is to invest certain<br/>\nevents with a loaded at times heavy sense of duty.  Duty is probably<br/>\nnot the reason we get excited about going somewhere or doing<br/>\nsomething.  But we promised, our word has to count for something, and<br/>\na number of other objections serve as references to ways that we&#39;re<br/>\nused to thinking about commitments.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could feel the same about words like job, work, chores as we could<br/>\nabout commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you and yours are not yet there and can&#39;t label the events in your<br/>\nlives &quot;choices&quot; (my family isn&#39;t there yet but we&#39;re closer than we<br/>\nused to be!) it may be because of the pressure you put on yourselves<br/>\nwhich then transfers to your child, and anybody else you may meet  ...<br/>\nHeck, the grocery clerk may get a little stress from seeing you that<br/>\nday.

What if the pressure just wasn&#39;t there?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor that to happen, the people who might be expected to feel pressure<br/>\nabout car arrangements, lack of money, time, or similar limits, etc.<br/>\nwould have decided to let go of pressure rather than holding onto it<br/>\nand passing it around.  The key is to emphasize, talk about and go<br/>\ntoward what is wanted.

My little 2 1/2 year old ds wanted to use the spray<br/>\nbottle yesterday.  I wasted precious together time being annoyed at<br/>\nnot having the spray cleaner when I needed it.  After about 15 fuming<br/>\nminutes getting pressurized over the fact that not much was done and<br/>\nstern with my little boy, I finally realized -- hey, ds just wants to<br/>\nfigure the spray bottle out.  So I spent some time showing him some<br/>\nthings about how to use the thing.  Those are things.  Ds is a person<br/>\nand that&#39;s what should matter.  He then appointed himself the task<br/>\nof spraying the floor wherever I needed it and some places I didn&#39;t...<br/>\n;)  A lot went on in that hour or so which we would have missed had I<br/>\nnot listened to what ds wanted, had I insisted on getting the job out<br/>\nof the way.  Realistically speaking, I can clean the floor at other<br/>\ntimes and putting the job off wouldn&#39;t matter even if I were having<br/>\ncompany over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted this as much to benefit others if it can as I did to clarify<br/>\nin my own mind things I&#39;ve been trying to change about the way I think<br/>\nand act especially toward my nearest and dearest.

My son seems to be reneging on commitments pretty often. I will<br/>\nask him if he would like to do something or talk to him about an opportunity<br/>\nhas come up. Sometimes he will say yes he does want to do it and at the last<br/>\nminute he changes his mind. I have a hard time with this because people are<br/>\ncounting on us/him to be there and I have made arrangements or changed mine<br/>\nand others schedules to do it. We have discussed it and he says that<br/>\nsometimes when it comes time to do it he just doesn&#39;t feel like it. An<br/>\nexample-Last week he was asked to be in a chess tournament at the local<br/>\nelementary school where he went to school for 2 years. He said yes and was<br/>\nexcited about it. I reminded him about it at least 4 times this week and he<br/>\neven played chess with him Grandma to prepare for the tournament. We talked<br/>\nabout it this morning and he said he wanted to go. I made other arrangements<br/>\nfor the PS kids I watch after school and my husband took his motorcycle<br/>\ninstead of my car to work so that we could have the car. I prepared snacks<br/>\nand such for my dd to have during the tournament and rescheduled our<br/>\nappointment with our realtor. Then as I was getting ready to go he said he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to go. He said he just changed his mind and wants to play with<br/>\nhis friends instead. A year ago I would have yelled at him to get in the car<br/>\nand given him a lecture on honoring commitments. Now I know that there must<br/>\nbe a better way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn in TX<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":112758,"nextTopicId":112669}}
