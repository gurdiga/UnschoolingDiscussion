I knew<br/>\nthis before I signed on. One of my spice, the SidehKitty, took over the<br/>\nteam for practice last Tuesday because I was sick. Now, he has voiced<br/>\nhis reservations about unschooling for fear our little FaeBeast won&#39;t<br/>\nlearn how to read. So, with that explanantion, let me explan Tuesdays<br/>\npractice as lead by my dear SidheKitty.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing, he asked the kids if and WHY they wanted to play soccer<br/>\nthis year. After getting all their answers, he told them to divide<br/>\nthemselves up into groups and play soceer. He&#39;d be happy to help anyone<br/>\nwith anything in particular. The 4 most experienced boys raced off, and<br/>\nbegan a free-form scrimage. OUr son began to practice dribbling up and<br/>\ndown the field, and the other fou boys asked to be taught how to field<br/>\nthe ball on their chests. They all switched and swapped activites until<br/>\nthe last 15 minutes. My spice then said that the whle field was needed<br/>\nto scrimmage on, so anyone doing something else needed to do it BESIDE<br/>\nthe field. Well, all nine kids joined in the scrimmage - some asking<br/>\nadvice as they went - and played their hearts out. TODAY was their first<br/>\ngame. They scored 6 goals. The other side scored one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDancing around in unschooling glee,<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Ravenhart</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24666,"nextTopicId":24138}}
