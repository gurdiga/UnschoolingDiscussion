Maria and Tony.  <br/>\nPotiphar&#39;s wife and Joseph.   Dulcinea singing &quot;born on a dung heap to die on a <br/>\ndung heap, a strumpet men use and forget,&quot; then undergoing a transformation <br/>\nbecause of the nobility modelled for her and shown to her by Don Quixote and <br/>\nSancho Panza.  They&#39;re just characters, and characters made up by another <br/>\ncharacter, at that.  A play within a play as it were, yet effective for stirring real <br/>\nemotions in the audience.  Grease. Jesus Christ, Superstar.  Little Shop of <br/>\nHorrors.  Issues of love, loyalty, kindness, sexual attraction and stories <br/>\nabout people NOT pressing the sexual issue (most of the show above, in one aspect <br/>\nor another) are good vehicles for bringing those topics out for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids will still listen to music designed for little kids--Raffi, Sesame <br/>\nStreet--but they&#39;ve also been analytical for years about more sophisticated <br/>\nthings.  Marty and Holly have both separately commented on how out of place <br/>\n&quot;Little Bird&quot; seems, in that musical, musically and emotionally.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t think of those things when we were discussing sex ed, and if this <br/>\nwasn&#39;t the right group/location, I guess I should cut and paste this over to <br/>\nwherever it belongs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76521,"nextTopicId":76544}}
