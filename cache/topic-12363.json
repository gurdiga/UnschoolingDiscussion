I was \nalways taught that it meant everyone helps everyone else, that is in their \nvillage or community.......not that it meant that the parents are out working \ntoo hard to know their own children, and the village or community(i.e. schools) \ntook care of them for them.&nbsp; My philosophy on this topic is that we build \nour own villages of family&nbsp; &amp; friends, and they are in fact also \nteachers of&nbsp; us &amp; our children..as we ,adults &amp; children , alike, \nalso are teachers of them &amp; theirs.and that we are all learning everyday \nfrom the people we trust &amp; care about.&nbsp; SO this would be a &quot;it takes a \nvillage to raise a child&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mentality, that I am proud of as \nthese people I have chosen to be in our lives are there for a reason.&nbsp; They \nmodel our values, and they care for us.&nbsp; </font></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Michelle, Dana &amp; Zain Harper<br>The Great \nNorthWest Washington<br>Legendary Tree &amp; \nLandscape<br></font></div></span></blockquote></html> \n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12359,"nextTopicId":12370}}
