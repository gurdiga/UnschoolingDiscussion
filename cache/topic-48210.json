But it&#39;s not like we rented a porn for him!! Joe and I were <br/>\nwaching with Joseph and Sierra. I can&#39;t really remember what movie it was <br/>\nbut it was a scary bug or monster thing. Had a sex scene thrown in I guess <br/>\nfor adults. Not real graphic. I man and a women in bed rolling around, naked <br/>\nbut only seeing boobs, slightly. We didn&#39;t know it was in the movie and <br/>\nSierra didn&#39;t say anything but Joseph voiced that he didn&#39;t like it and it <br/>\nmade him obviously uncomfortable. It was over before we could stop it and <br/>\nthat was that.

The worst <br/>\nhe know is butt head.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell there have been a few occasions out in public where the kids would hear <br/>\nsomeone say something and ask what it meant. Yes we hear the word f*ck at <br/>\nthe grocery store! And the same for some of the movies they want to see. <br/>\nEven the scary bug movies have it in. I guess just to get an R rating so <br/>\nmore people will go and see it. Now they really don&#39;t comment on it and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see that it will be a problem for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I find it easy to let him choose where he has had the experiences, but <br/>\nmore difficult when he hasn&#39;t yet, like sex and bad language.

Again, it wasn&#39;t like we set out <br/>\nto experiment and see what they could handle. It really was an innocent <br/>\naccident but taught us all something. Sierra who is a year younger didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to think it was a big deal. Plenty of time her dad and I are hugging on <br/>\nthe couch laying down and these people just happened to look naked while <br/>\ndoing it. No big deal for her. Joseph just didn&#39;t like to look at it. He <br/>\nalso turns his head if he walks into my room and I&#39;m wearing a bra. This is <br/>\na kid who saw my boobs out all over the county when I was bf. I just try and <br/>\nbe honest with him and tell him it&#39;s okay when he walks in. In his own time, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll ask more or be okay with it. I&#39;m certainly not going to go on a rant <br/>\nthat nudity and sex are perfectly natural if he&#39;s not wanting to hear it <br/>\nright now. Although again it&#39;s been mildly said.

We know, by experience, <br/>\nwhat bothers him and what doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m not terribly worried about the <br/>\nviolence he sees because what he enjoys is not &quot;real, scary people&#39; killing, <br/>\nlike Jason movies but fantastic stuff like giant bugs and worms. He&#39;s okay <br/>\nwith that and understands that giant things like that don&#39;t exist. He&#39;s also <br/>\nokay with robot things like Terminator. Sexual scenes he gets uncomfortable <br/>\nwith and so we make sure not to have any in the movies he sees. The language <br/>\nhe really doesn&#39;t seem to get as far as bad words. He knows that he <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t say them, he doesn&#39;t hear us say them and to be honest, pretty <br/>\nmuch ignores them when he hears them. We know what he can handle because we <br/>\nhave sat with him and have seen his reactions. Now of course if I say that I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s a movie he wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with, he just says okay. He <br/>\nknows the difference and knows I understand too. Of course as he gets older, <br/>\nthings will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to know what your child can handle and what he can&#39;t. <br/>\nThe only way to do that is by sitting with him and discussing and watching <br/>\nhim to see his reaction. I would think that anything to strong for him he <br/>\nwoulnd&#39;t want to watch anymore and so you rented a movie for nothing. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine a 5 year old being interested in things way too graphic for <br/>\nthem. Anyone else had this happen? A kid seeming too young watching adult <br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food, we don&#39;t worry about it at all. I have always said I choose <br/>\nmy battles very wisely. Harsh word battle but I think you know what I mean. <br/>\nLike not sweating the small stuff, and it&#39;s mostly all small stuff!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523757,"authorName":"Pam Hartley","from":"Pam Hartley &lt;pamhartley@...&gt;","profile":"pdhartley2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Question about self-regulating","postDate":"1035642248","msgId":48210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBINEwwMEJTSUVPODFQQG10YTUuc25mYzIxLnBiaS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48218,"prevInTime":48209,"nextInTime":48211,"topicId":48210,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
