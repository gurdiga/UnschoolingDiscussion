I feel sorry for the kids who are never<br/>\nthe hosts for these adventures.

I was suprised <br/>\nbecause, Cody(12) is like the son I will never have and he really gets upset <br/>\nwhen they miss their Tuesday nite trip to Rhonda&#39;s. His mom said he&#39;d been <br/>\nhanging out a lot lately with the neighborhood boys. (He goes to school, BTW) <br/>\nSaturday nite she was waiting for him to come home from miniture golf/mini-amusement <br/>\npark and at 11:15 she got worried he wasn&#39;t home yet. She went outside and <br/>\nsaw her neighbor who took the boys to the park and asked if the boys were back. <br/>\nThe mom said &quot;No, The park closes at midnite and the boys wanted to stay until <br/>\nit closed.&quot; My girlfriend was glad she went outside and just happened to see <br/>\nthe mom, instead of calling Cody on the cell phone the boys had for an <br/>\nemergency. So if the park was a 30 minute ride to get there, then I would say that <br/>\nmore like than not,  your son and his friend and the dad probably stayed until <br/>\nclosing and then maybe grabbed a bite of food. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure your own tragedy could possibly cloud your vision, but that&#39;s okay. <br/>\nI&#39;d just be careful not to create something that isn&#39;t there and putting your <br/>\nson on the spot. One thing about being with another family, even when it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething fun, you lose your voice to some degree. He needs to know he has a <br/>\nvoice all the time regardless of where he is or who he is with.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps rather then questioning him about what happened and why didn&#39;t he <br/>\ncall anyway????... maybe you can discuss how you understand he was having fun and <br/>\nmaybe he didn&#39;t want to appear to be needing to call his mom, but that is how <br/>\nyour  family operates. When you get back, you call. Time is of no bearing. <br/>\nMake it more about just wanting to know he was safe in a warm house and then you <br/>\ncan go over what they did when he gets home. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two cents, <br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Late night issue","postDate":"1057168265","msgId":75964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjZC5jZWRlZmUwLjJjMzQ3NTg5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75963,"nextInTopic":75965,"prevInTime":75963,"nextInTime":75965,"topicId":75958,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/2/2003 1:40:39 PM Eastern Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2138093126\">In a message dated 7/2/2003 1:40:39 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould being home by 11:00 really be that much better than having fun until <br/>\nmidnight?&gt;<br/>\nThank you for your reply.<br/>\nI do think it helps the dad that his son has a playmate.

Being an ex-cop <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter much to me.  Of course, I, being the worrier would want to <br/>\nmake sure my child was safe and nothing harmful was going on.  I wonder about the <br/>\nwhispering, but maybe someone else was still sleeping.  If I felt perfectly <br/>\nsecure in the adults supervising my child, then I wouldn&#39;t worry, but I would <br/>\nprobably say that I missed having them around and ask if there was something <br/>\nhim and his friend might want to do with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nglena<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] Late night issue","postDate":"1057167482","msgId":75963,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlMy5jN2ViNTYwLjJjMzQ3MjdhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75958,"nextInTopic":75964,"prevInTime":75962,"nextInTime":75964,"topicId":75958,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/2/03 11:24:08 AM, HMSL2@aol.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1411095895\">In a message dated 7/2/03 11:24:08 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Would any of you take issue with your child being out until 1 or 2 am with <br/>\na <br/>\nnon family member?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould being home by 11:00 really be that much better than having fun until <br/>\nmidnight?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would talk to the dad and see if he minds your son being over there so <br/>\nmuch.

I said yes. Since summer broke Dustin has been at this <br/>\nboys home every day. I have hardly seen him the past two and a half weeks. <br/>\nDustin came by at 4ish to get clothes as he was sleeping over also. I asked him <br/>\nto call when they where back into town (they went to beach area 30 min away).<br/>\n<br/>\nI called this am at 11:30 because he had not called at all last night or this <br/>\nam. When the dad picked up the phone he was still sleeping. He got Dustin for <br/>\nme and I asked how come he didn&#39;t call? He said they had gotten back really <br/>\nlate and whispered it a bit. I said Dustin I am up until 11-12. He said Mom we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get back until 1 or 2!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow part of me feels over protective and annoyed and the other is like chill <br/>\nout and speak to him when he gets home. This I will do but I wanted to call <br/>\nback and tell him I would like him to come home so I could find out what would <br/>\nkeep them out until 1 or 2am. He is still over there.... It is a 3 minute bike <br/>\nride for him to be home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould any of you take issue with your child being out until 1 or 2 am with a <br/>\nnon family member? I know the Dad a little, he is a former police officer and <br/>\nI think if he wasn&#39;t I may be more bothered. Maybe a false sense of trust I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know......<br/>\nOur family(Siters child and Me when I was 13 where mollested/raped. Mine is <br/>\nactually going to DA this month) has had some horrid situations happen and I <br/>\nthink that may be part of my concern and worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much time is too much away from home. My intuition tells me he is gone <br/>\ntoo long. <br/>\nWhat is the opinion of others on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76023,"nextTopicId":76018}}
