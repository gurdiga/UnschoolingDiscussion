I found Nanci K. in Idaho&#39;s post<br/>\nabout Samain, etc. fascinating.  I never learned about any of that<br/>\nin school, and, well, if it wasn&#39;t taught in school, I didn&#39;t learn<br/>\nit...  I did, however, read a book called &quot;The Druid&#39;s Gift,&quot; I forget<br/>\nwho wrote it, and it talked a little about Samain.  Very interesting<br/>\nbook.  I&#39;m very interested in the ways different religions, cultures,<br/>\npeople, etc., celebrate different events.  Oh, and BTW, Santa means<br/>\nSaint in many languages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, thank you to all the people who responded to my request for<br/>\nadvice, public and private.  Sorry I don&#39;t have time to respond to all<br/>\nof you personally - maybe when I&#39;m an old great-great grandmother... <br/>\nBut I got lots of good advice.  It&#39;s nice to be able to talk about this<br/>\n(having a new baby and a toddler) without being immediately scolded for<br/>\nkeeping my son out of baby genius school - he must be the only toddler<br/>\nnot enrolled...  My MIL is coming for a few days, which will be nice (in<br/>\na way), but like I said, DH is so burnt out and depressed from his job,<br/>\nhe&#39;s no help at all at home.  Maybe having his mom here for a while will<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nLove, Melanie in Japan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3514,"nextTopicId":3518}}
