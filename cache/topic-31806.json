He actually chose to do the algebra on his own after reading a Newsweek article about this college student who works in a factory over summer breaks.  He told me that he really does want to go to college and so we sat down and looked at some of the requirements for admission to some of our local colleges, so I think of his math as still being unschooling.  But he does Vocabulary from Classical Roots for about 15 minutes a day and then all of us sit down and read one of the history stories from Story of the World and then he and his brother can choose to do any of the different activities if they want to.  That&#39;s it for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 9yo is using Saxon 54.  I usually just sit down with him, we read over the lesson together and then he does the practice problems and usually about five problems from the lesson.  If he just wants to give me the answers orally that&#39;s fine, and if he seems to understand the principle right off the bat, then he won&#39;t even do the problems from the lesson.  We do &quot;book math&quot; a couple of times a week and then the rest of the time he plays MathBlaster or Totally Tut or Subtraction Shark, etc.  He does history with his brother and I, and occasionally I&#39;ll ask him to do some spelling puzzles or we&#39;ll play Alphabug Soup or Scrabble.  That&#39;s pretty much it.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo we&#39;re not very structured and if there is something more interesting going on, or if the boys are reading a good book that they just can&#39;t put down or are playing a game (not a video game or watching TV because my husband is still against these things before 5pm), then we&#39;ll just skip &quot;lessons&quot; for the day.  I would eventually just like to skip them altogether, but my husband is taking some time to get what I&#39;m trying to say about unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nPamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you doing a whole hour of math every day?<br/>\nYou called it semi-structured - what does that mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 26, 2005, at 8:30 AM, Rebecca Benson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Actually, only the bedtime situation has been addressed.

The  <br/>\nreason we have to &quot;exercise&quot; in our modern world is because we don&#39;t have to  <br/>\n&quot;work&quot; for our survival.  So spend some time imagining what it would be  like <br/>\nwithout electricity &lt;g&gt; and do those kinds of things throughout the  day.  Tend a <br/>\ngarden, sweep the carpet instead of vacuum, cook  outside, spend lots of time <br/>\noutside with the kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI spend a lot of time imagining what my dad&#39;s childhood was like,  based on <br/>\nthe stories he&#39;s told me over my lifetime and knowing his mother and  putting <br/>\nher stories together. (She&#39;ll be 100 in November, but her mind is  gone.)  She <br/>\nhad 4 kids and a farmhouse to run, and her husband died while  her kids were <br/>\nyoung, and the river flooded and changed course and took their  farm and they <br/>\nhad to move into town.  So what was her life like?   Nursing twins (my daddy <br/>\nand his sister) and giving birth again so soon  after.  Cooking what she grows <br/>\nor slaughters.  I can still  remember her drinking black coffee out of the <br/>\nsaucer and the smell of burnt  bacon in her house.  My dad told me a story about <br/>\nhow the mule got  stuck in the mud with all 4 kids on it&#39;s back, and his mother <br/>\ndragged that  mule out and all 4 kids with just her own strength.

Partly we think it in justification of our <br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; mothers and grandmothers.   &quot;Why would she have said it 200 times if <br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; no truth to it?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To be mindful we need to consider each thing we do in its own immediate<br/>\n&gt; light.   It&#39;s worth reminding children of scheduled activities the next <br/>\n&gt; day, but to<br/>\n&gt; try to *make* them sleep eight hours before is likely to cause agitation <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; stress, and people do NOT fall asleep when they&#39;re stressed and agitated. <br/>\n&gt; Five<br/>\n&gt; or six hours of peaceful, gentle sleep is WAY way better than eight hours <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; being in the bed feeling unloved and controlled and ashamed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My kids are 19, 16, and 13.   Recently, Marty has been going to sleep the<br/>\n&gt; earliest.   If he has to go to work the next day, he&#39;s usually asleep by <br/>\n&gt; midnight<br/>\n&gt; or 1:00.   He works from noon to five.   When he&#39;s not going to work, he<br/>\n&gt; might be up later with friends, either online or out at an allnight <br/>\n&gt; resaurant or<br/>\n&gt; Walmart.    Kirby works at 11:00 each weekday.   He doesn&#39;t need as much <br/>\n&gt; sleep<br/>\n&gt; as Marty.   He gets himself up and gets there on time.   Holly has had the<br/>\n&gt; most erratic schedule lately.   Now that school has started it&#39;s getting <br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; regular, because the kids she plays Halo II   can&#39;t stay up so late on <br/>\n&gt; school<br/>\n&gt; nights, so the school schedules of kids in other parts of the country are<br/>\n&gt; affecting her at our house.   That&#39;s interesting.   But after they&#39;ve gone <br/>\n&gt; to bed and<br/>\n&gt; Kirby wants to go to sleep (the XBox is in his room), she sometimes stays <br/>\n&gt; up<br/>\n&gt; later on the computer, chatting with some of the kids she met at HesFes, <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; their friends, before they go to school in the morning, or later if it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; not a<br/>\n&gt; schoolday.   Some days, lately, Holly sleeps until late afternoon. <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes<br/>\n&gt; she sets an alarm for noon or 1:00 and asks me to make sure she gets up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When there&#39;s a reason to get up, they set an alarm and get up cheerfully.<br/>\n&gt; When being asleep seems better than being awake, they go to bed.   Because<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ve done it all their lives, I&#39;m less concerned about it, and they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; less<br/>\n&gt; likely to stay up just for the sake of staying up than might happen in <br/>\n&gt; families<br/>\n&gt; new to the idea.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no good reason to jump straight to a different way of being, when <br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; can be done gradually.   Lots of little &quot;yesses&quot; are better than one giant <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t care anymore,&quot; in lots of ways.    Better with food, better with <br/>\n&gt; sleep,<br/>\n&gt; better with choices.   Maybe even better with a curriculum, if the parents <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; undecided.   Rather than &quot;try unschooling&quot; and fail from lack of<br/>\n&gt; understanding or desire, might it be better if they just don&#39;t make kids <br/>\n&gt; start their work<br/>\n&gt; or finish it, and let it peter out with all of them seeing the lack of<br/>\n&gt; importance of it, and seeing the kids learn more happily other ways?

When the kids were <br/>\nbabies I&#39;d nurse them to sleep and stay with them or in the next room, and if one <br/>\nwoke up I&#39;d go in and carry him or nurse him or rock him.   I never &quot;put them <br/>\ndown for naps,&quot; and my friends who did that, who scheduled hours of dark and <br/>\nquiet and tried to &quot;train them&quot; to sleep seemed even in that first year or two <br/>\nto be less connected to their babies than I wanted to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby was old enough to say he wasn&#39;t sleepy, when I was really sleepy, <br/>\nthere were a couple of things I&#39;d do.   Sometimes I would put on a cassette <br/>\ntape and ask him to just listen to it until it ended, and then if he was still <br/>\nawake he could wake me up.    Maybe twice he lasted through, but dozens of <br/>\ntimes he&#39;d fall asleep before it was over.    The other thing was if he woke up in <br/>\nthe middle of the night and I wasn&#39;t able to wake up enough to be with him, <br/>\nI&#39;d set him up with finger food and a sippy cup in a high chair with a long <br/>\nvideotape, and a little blanket, and he would either eat and drink and watch <br/>\nuntil I woke up, or more often would put the blanket down as a pillow and fall <br/>\nasleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were in a small house then, and we could hear each other speak in normal <br/>\nvoices, and at night when it was quiet we could hear each other breathe.   In <br/>\nthe big house we&#39;re in now, that wouldn&#39;t have worked as well.   But what I <br/>\nhave done here, though Holly was turning six when we moved here, was to lie down <br/>\non the couch in the den, with her on a futon on the floor watching a movie to <br/>\nwhich she would fall asleep.   I was still asleep, but she wasn&#39;t alone.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week we played a verson of that.   Holly wanted to watch a movie <br/>\nwith me.   I&#39;d already watched it earlier, and told her I might fall asleep.   <br/>\nShe said okay.   I was in a recliner and was awake enough that if she said <br/>\nsomething I could respond, and I as trying to keep track of where we were in the <br/>\nmovie a little, but mostly I slept.   When it was over we both went to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo tell a child &quot;If you don&#39;t sleep eight hours you&#39;ll be grumpy&quot; is the same <br/>\nas saying &quot;if you eat too much candy you&#39;ll get sick.&quot;     You risk flatly <br/>\ntelling a lie.   It&#39;s threat for the purpose of control.

It would go something like this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; * poster explains an idea or question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *bunch of posts come up to answer question, or give other ideas<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *someone writes something like &quot;your reply to my post was snippy, all I<br/>\nmeant was ...&quot; or &quot;I take offense at your tone&quot;, or &quot;I was hurt because you<br/>\nseemed to dismiss me in your post&quot;- these are all examples of writing *about<br/>\nthe writing*.  the &quot;style&quot; of the post, the &quot;rudeness&quot; or whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *moderator would immediately post a reminder that the list has a no meta<br/>\ndiscussion policy...  messages of that nature can be e-mailed privately...<br/>\ne-mail the moderator if you have questions..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ANyway, I appreciated it because it did help us remember what you said<br/>\nbelow- because this isnt the forum for bashing eachothers writing- it kept<br/>\nus focused on sharing our ideas and giving the benefit of the doubt to those<br/>\nposting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It is interesting, because in our homeschooling group this kind of came<br/>\nup.  I had been instramental in the formulating of a &quot;conflict resolution&quot;<br/>\npolicy for the group.   The first rule was that if you had a &quot;problem&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;conflict&quot; with someone (no matter what age) your first step is to approach<br/>\nthat person individually with your feelings.  There is more..but anyway, a<br/>\nbig disgusting &quot;thing&quot; happened because certain &quot;adults&quot; in the group didnt<br/>\nfollow the policy- and it could have ALL been avoided.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, this relates I think because for one, when you know you must<br/>\npersonally discuss things you have a problem with, they dont seem to be that<br/>\nmuch of a problem-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; VERY much easier to sort of just yell out into cyber space &quot;I was dissed!&quot;<br/>\nor talk in a private meeting with sympathisers about how &quot;awful&quot; the other<br/>\nperson is and how they think- when you havent even spoke to the person and<br/>\ndont really understand them at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keeps you honest, &quot;professional&quot;, keeps you thinking about and processing<br/>\nwhat others say instead of lashing out- because if you are going to post<br/>\nsomething, it has to relate to the actual discussion.  There is no doubt<br/>\nthat things still get heated- but they generally dont get into the personal<br/>\nattack realm.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ANyway- there you go,<br/>\n&gt; Bronwen<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Fetteroll<br/>\n&gt;   To: Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2002 5:27 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kindness and META discussions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   For the first time I&#39;m not going to quote anyone ;-) Because it applies<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   everyone.

Or leave anyone feeling off the hook.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;ve been mulling over Bronwen&#39;s idea of no META discussions. I thought<br/>\n&gt;   perhaps it would put a gag on discussions. But now I do notice a pattern<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   the events leading up to a fight and it does seem to be discussions of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;   discussion. For example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   1) Someone takes exception to the way something is expressed or someone<br/>\n&gt;   takes exception to the boundaries someone sets (eg, that&#39;s not<br/>\nunschooling)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   2) The poster defends herself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   3) Others polarize into camps to defend the poster or the person who<br/>\nfelt<br/>\n&gt;   attacked or the style of posting or what is and isn&#39;t rudeness and so<br/>\nforth.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Bronwen, can you tell us more about the policy? Do you have some of the<br/>\n&gt;   email reminders that the moderators used or addresses where we can write<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;   ask them for examples they&#39;ve used?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   The first step is &quot;we&quot; need to let go of the idea of there being a &quot;we&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   here. &quot;We&quot; can&#39;t be kinder or blunter or more probing or huggier because<br/>\n&gt;   &quot;we&quot; are a collection of always changing individuals. Each of us<br/>\ndeserves<br/>\n&gt;   *trust* that she&#39;s communicating the way *she* feels is best, and<br/>\n*trust*<br/>\n&gt;   that if she doesn&#39;t feel she&#39;s acheiving *her own* goals of<br/>\ncommunication<br/>\n&gt;   (*whatever* they may be and *regardless* of what others think her goals<br/>\n&gt;   *should* be) that she will learn from her mistakes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   If some of us want a kinder list then the only way to acheive that is to<br/>\n&gt;   *set an example*, *be* the tone of kindness, *NOT* the enforcer of a<br/>\ncertain<br/>\n&gt;   standard of kindness. To be kind we can police our own selves *not* each<br/>\n&gt;   other. We can&#39;t even police others who we feel aren&#39;t policing<br/>\nthemselves<br/>\n&gt;   properly. (Shades of fundamentalism!) We have to *trust* that they can<br/>\nread<br/>\n&gt;   the moderator reminders as well as we can and can interpret them --<br/>\nperhaps<br/>\n&gt;   differently! -- but as well as we can. If we feel someone&#39;s being rude,<br/>\n*let<br/>\n&gt;   it go*. (Talk to the moderators. Let the moderators handle it. If<br/>\nsomeone<br/>\n&gt;   doesn&#39;t like the way the moderators are handling something then they can<br/>\n&gt;   read any policies we come up with and discuss the *policies* not a<br/>\n&gt;   particular poster.) We don&#39;t set an example of kindness by reprimanding<br/>\n&gt;   those we feel are unkind.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   (Same with wanting a blunter list or more challenging list. We need to<br/>\n&gt;   accept that not everyone likes blunt or probing or probing of newbies or<br/>\n&gt;   whatever. If &quot;this list&quot; is less challenging than before is it the fault<br/>\nof<br/>\n&gt;   those who are responding the way *they* feel best or the fault of those<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt;   *aren&#39;t* responding in ways they feel best? We need to *let go* of the<br/>\nidea<br/>\n&gt;   that the &quot;best way&quot; to help people get unschooling is to get them to<br/>\nexamine<br/>\n&gt;   themselves. (Yes, even I&#39;ll have to let go of that! ;-) Some people feel<br/>\n&gt;   it&#39;s best to lead gently. *They&#39;re entitled to that opinion* and<br/>\nentitled to<br/>\n&gt;   lead gently. Some people do want to be led gently. They&#39;re entitled to<br/>\ngo at<br/>\n&gt;   the pace *they* feel is best. We have to *let it go* even if we don&#39;t<br/>\nthink<br/>\n&gt;   the questioner is choosing what they need. It isn&#39;t unschooling to<br/>\ndecide<br/>\n&gt;   that someone needs blunt questioning or self-examination. -- Or decide<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt;   need gently led either! -- We have to trust that people coming here can<br/>\npick<br/>\n&gt;   and choose from the approaches they&#39;re offered. Sometimes they *will*<br/>\nget<br/>\n&gt;   offended since some newbies will expect only gentle and I think it&#39;s up<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   the moderators to send out an email about different posting styles and<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt;   problems of interpretation of emails.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Though I can bet &quot;we&quot; will generally agree that &quot;You&#39;re a sh*thead!&quot; is<br/>\nout<br/>\n&gt;   of the realm of polite, each of us as individuals *will* have different<br/>\n&gt;   ideas of what is and isn&#39;t polite or what is and isn&#39;t necessary to<br/>\ndiscuss<br/>\n&gt;   unschooling. And those levels will push other people&#39;s buttons.<br/>\nEspecially,<br/>\n&gt;   unfortunately, newbies. Some people (the poster it&#39;s directed at or<br/>\n&gt;   bystanders) *will* feel &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling&quot; or &quot;Why do you think<br/>\nthat?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;   is rude or unkind. We need to *trust* that the poster&#39;s intentions are<br/>\n*not*<br/>\n&gt;   unkindness and they are doing what they feel is best.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I think, as a policy, it&#39;s best that if someone, even when it happens to<br/>\na<br/>\n&gt;   newbie, has issue with the way someone has worded something, then it<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt;   remain between the two posters. No one jump in to defend the newbie, the<br/>\n&gt;   poster or the style of posting. If someone sees a problem, then alert a<br/>\n&gt;   moderator. (Perhaps moderator email addresses should be included in the<br/>\n&gt;   footer attached to posts.) And, as Bronwen said was done on the other<br/>\nlist,<br/>\n&gt;   as soon as someone says they don&#39;t like the way something is worded, the<br/>\n&gt;   moderators need to send out a private email and/or emails to the list<br/>\n&gt;   depending on their discretion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   *Perhaps* one problem with no META discussions is how can the list<br/>\ndiscuss<br/>\n&gt;   policy? I *don&#39;t* think setting policy is up to the moderators. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   up to the users to decide and the moderators to act as reminders (and<br/>\n&gt;   perhaps enforcers if it comes to that) of the *list&#39;s* wishes. (Or<br/>\nHelen&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   wishes of course! But she seems to be of the policy that we can manage<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt;   create what we need, not rely on her to create what she thinks we need.<br/>\n&gt;   She&#39;s an unschooling kind of lady! :-) Perhaps if we want to discuss<br/>\nchanges<br/>\n&gt;   in policy, we can write &quot;Policy discussion&quot; in the title of the post.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Another problem I do see is that some discussions revolve around what is<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt;   isn&#39;t unschooling and whether unschooling should be defined or not.<br/>\nBeing<br/>\n&gt;   firmly in the camp that the definition or unschooling can&#39;t be watered<br/>\ndown<br/>\n&gt;   or it will become synonymous with &quot;do whatever&#39;s best for your family&quot;,<br/>\nit&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;   really hard for me to say that we need to let the newbies come in, hear<br/>\nboth<br/>\n&gt;   *positions* in the argument and then decide for themselves.  I think<br/>\nthere<br/>\n&gt;   is something valuable in discussing the *idea* of whether unschooling<br/>\nshould<br/>\n&gt;   be defined or not or whether defining it is limiting or clarifying, so<br/>\nI&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;   not sure how such discussions can be allowed and still maintain a META<br/>\n&gt;   policy. I think I need to think on that some more to see if I&#39;m being<br/>\n&gt;   objective enough or not ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   So perhaps the moderators can have a few email reminders in their tool<br/>\nbag:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   1) No META discussions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   2) Definitions of unschooling (and perhaps some attitudes about defining<br/>\n&gt;   unschooling.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   3) The problems of interpretation of emails and why it&#39;s a policy that<br/>\nwe<br/>\n&gt;   assume no ill intent in posts. And then what channels there are for<br/>\n&gt;   complaining about a particular poster.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Well, I could probably come up some examples of the above to serve as<br/>\n&gt;   starting points to be picked over but my daughter is asking for Nancy<br/>\nDrew<br/>\n&gt;   to be read and I&#39;ve already been at this post for 2 hours so the<br/>\nexamples<br/>\n&gt;   will have to wait. ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!

You<br/>\n&gt; spend time talking to your children and examining their decisions<br/>\n&gt; without forcing or coercing them to do what you think is best.  Their<br/>\n&gt; decision making abilities didn&#39;t develop in a vacuum simply because<br/>\n&gt; they are unschooled.  Your parenting style appears to be a great<br/>\n&gt; influence, and, from reading the messages here, I&#39;m starting to see<br/>\n&gt; that one&#39;s parenting style cannot be divorced from unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My two oldest children, by contrast, haven&#39;t been unschooled, but my<br/>\n&gt; 12yo daughter makes very responsible, classy choices for herself most<br/>\n&gt; of the time as well.  This I attribute to my parenting style and her<br/>\n&gt; personality bent. My 12 yo son, on the other hand, does not make<br/>\n&gt; decisions that are in his best interest.  His decisions have been a<br/>\n&gt; threat to his own safety and the safety of others, at times.  Like<br/>\n&gt; you and your son, we spend a great deal of time talking him through<br/>\n&gt; the cause and effect of his actions, but he often doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;<br/>\n&gt; until he has experienced a consequence that is painful for him. He<br/>\n&gt; has been this way since birth, it seems. Would unschooling/NCP change<br/>\n&gt; his personality bent,I wonder?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 3<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2002 09:51:17 -0800<br/>\n&gt;    From: Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: the magic of reading (maybe)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I am definitely not okay w/the idea of my kid not being able to read at<br/>\n&gt; &gt;16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and<br/>\nsound<br/>\n&gt; &gt;games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; &gt;start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to push these kids into<br/>\n&gt; an academic mold when they could well be the person who invents something<br/>\n&gt; really useful to our society or something.  Edison eventually learned to<br/>\n&gt; read.  If he&#39;d been made to stay in school and learn academics, we would<br/>\n&gt; probably have missed out on a lot of useful inventions.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son is able to read what he *has* to, though slowly.  I think his<br/>\n&gt; reading will still improve by the time he&#39;s ready to leave home, but if it<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s still going to be ok.<br/>\n&gt; Tia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\n&gt; Eleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n&gt; *********************************************<br/>\n&gt; Tia Leschke<br/>\n&gt; leschke@...<br/>\n&gt; On Vancouver Island<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 4<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 29 Jan 2002 12:51:02 -0600<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Julie Stauffer&quot; &lt;jnjstau@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1784<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;We use workbooks too only their used to earn money and other rewards&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps I misunderstand, but it seems you are saying that you pay your<br/>\nkids<br/>\n&gt; money to do workbooks.

It&#39;s a pattern, she knows it, I<br/>\n&gt; know it, we all know it.  The last time she got into a bad pattern,<br/>\n&gt; she wuld get royally mad if we left the house without her.  We had<br/>\n&gt; numerous discussions about the fact that it is like waking the dead<br/>\n&gt; to get her up and we would give her one wake-up call and then be on<br/>\n&gt; our way from then on.

It does not matter if I want her up<br/>\n&gt; in the morning or not.  But she had to learn to live peacefully with<br/>\n&gt; the consequences too.  When she was going off on us for leaving her<br/>\n&gt; at home, I started making her get up when we went out.

We get filled up with too many scary stories of kids hitting 16 and<br/>\n&gt; being illiterate, and the *cause* that&#39;s pointed to is because the school<br/>\n&gt; failed them, because it didn&#39;t have the proper programs at the proper<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n&gt; But it just isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s because of the pressure to read by a certain<br/>\n&gt; age (4th grade), the stigma of being singled out because you can&#39;t do what<br/>\n&gt; &quot;everyone&quot; else can, the tedium of being forced to do something you don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want to do yet and have no interest in.

Sounds like fun! This is not to say you need to<br/>\n&gt; change anything about what you&#39;re doing. Only to gently suggest that if<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re looking for ideas to make things kids need to know fun, you&#39;ll find<br/>\n&gt; the offerings on this list slim in that area.

Unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>\n&gt; kids need to multiply or learn geography or history or grammar or how to<br/>\n&gt; write. Those things *will* be part of their lives and kids *will* reach a<br/>\n&gt; level of competence that is useful to them. Books will be set in real<br/>\n&gt; locations, games will be played that need arithmetic to be better at,<br/>\n&gt; message boards will have messages that kids will want to respond to. (Or<br/>\nnot<br/>\n&gt; if their interests lie elsewhere.) The concept of unschooling is that,<br/>\njust<br/>\n&gt; as they took what path they found most useful for their own needs in<br/>\n&gt; learning to speak (talking about dinosaurs or poop or Teletubbies), kids<br/>\n&gt; will acquire what they need as adults by exploring the paths of their<br/>\n&gt; interests. Whatever level of geography (or whatever) they acquire<br/>\nnaturally<br/>\n&gt; through living -- and continue acquiring through  out their lives -- is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; level that they will need as adults. *If* they need a higher level for<br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; purpose that suddenly strikes them, they will either set about acquiring<br/>\nit<br/>\n&gt; because they know they can learn whatever they set out to learn, or they<br/>\n&gt; will have already acquired it because it&#39;s part of the things they are<br/>\n&gt; naturally drawn to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades higher<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In unschooling there are no grades or placements.

Or because she&#39;s not performing at some<br/>\n&gt; grade-level standard?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Again, this is not saying what you&#39;re doing is wrong, only that if you<br/>\nwant<br/>\n&gt; ideas on doing more of the same, other lists (like one that deals with<br/>\n&gt; eclectic homeschooling) will have *way* more ideas for you than this one.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 17<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2002 08:36:16 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: the haves, the havenots and unschooling by definition<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; on 1/28/02 1:42 AM, Lynda at lurine@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; If the term disappears tomorrow, who cares?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I care.

If someone is<br/>\n&gt; speaking in a way that *some* find irritating and *some* find helpful --<br/>\n&gt; *not* helpful because they enjoy being irritated but because they find<br/>\n&gt; something in the style illuminating -- then the problem *isn&#39;t* how to<br/>\n&gt; silence that person so no one gets irritated, but to create an environment<br/>\n&gt; where that style *and* other styles can co-exist so that those who come<br/>\nhere<br/>\n&gt; can have a *choice*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps all it will take is an email reminder posted to the list that<br/>\n&gt; different people have different styles of communicating, or some such<br/>\n&gt; wording.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2002 09:43:54 -0500<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;Joseph Fuerst&quot; &lt;fuerst@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1784<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **When I say I am done talking about him because I think most of you<br/>\n&gt; have heard enough, I&#39;m told that I should explain again.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Bridget**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, actually,  I never &quot;told you&quot; you *should* do anything.

Would you want to allow your kid to go out into the world so<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unprepared? Aren&#39;t you worried they&#39;ll be taken advantage of, or be<br/>\nunable<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to negotiate contracts/instructions/newspapers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am definitely not okay w/the idea of my kid not being able to read at<br/>\n&gt; 16. I think reading is a basic skill for survival in this society. My kid<br/>\n&gt; is almost six and he is just starting to read. We do phonics stuff and<br/>\nsound<br/>\n&gt; games every day *at his request*. But even if he weren&#39;t into it, I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; start &quot;making him&quot; at a later age. Not at the age he is now, but certainly<br/>\n&gt; by 10 or so. Yup, you betcha I would! It is the one thing I feel strongly<br/>\n&gt; that he has to learn. Years ago, it was illegal for my ancestors to learn<br/>\n&gt; how to read (we are African American) in this country. I feel it would be<br/>\n&gt; a slap in the face for all their struggles for me to neglect this one<br/>\n&gt; aspect of his upbringing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Best,<br/>\n&gt; Lynn***<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now this is the kind of thinking that just begs for a response along the<br/>\n&gt; lines of unschooling!  I&#39;ll just ask,  Lynn,  you&#39;re willing to give up<br/>\n&gt; unschooling if your child can&#39;t read by age 10?  I&#39;m wondering whether you<br/>\n&gt; fully understand it then.  And I won&#39;t speak for Tia,  but she has<br/>\ncommented<br/>\n&gt; many times that her experience of intervening with her son seemed to make<br/>\n&gt; things worse in their relationship.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I truly understand your dilemma,  for I have experienced what you are<br/>\nsimply<br/>\n&gt; talking about as a possible situation.  Let me share a bit of my<br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n&gt; Since we moved away from the school track for our family (my oldest had<br/>\n&gt; attended kindergarten and two yrs of preschool),  I explored aspects of<br/>\n&gt; educating our children at home and found that unschooling resonated as the<br/>\n&gt; most genuine way to allow my children to grow.<br/>\n&gt;     When my very intelligent dd wasn&#39;t reading by the end of &#39;first<br/>\ngrade&#39;,<br/>\n&gt; I worried.  She had even forgotten the sight words she had memorized in<br/>\n&gt; kindergarten.  All the veteran homeschoolers advised me to take a deep<br/>\nbreat<br/>\n&gt; h and be patient.  I had to trusyt a bunch of people I&#39;d never met in<br/>\n&gt; person?  Well,  I did.  For several months.  And as dd did NOT &#39;take off&#39;<br/>\nin<br/>\n&gt; her reading,  my patience left me.  I once again struggled to &#39;let go.  A<br/>\n&gt; discussion came up here ...about whether or not it&#39;s ok for a parent to<br/>\n&gt; &#39;just let them grow up illiterate&#39;.  But again,  the those who had older<br/>\n&gt; children,  children who learned to read &#39;later&#39;,  others coping with the<br/>\n&gt; same circumstance all recommended being patient.   I went up and down this<br/>\n&gt; roller coaster....though the hills and valleys became less and less<br/>\n&gt; pronounced.<br/>\n&gt;     Finally,  about a year ago,  I *truly got it*!!!  I had *really*<br/>\nmissed<br/>\n&gt; the point of unschooling in regard to reading!  All along,  I was pushing<br/>\ndd<br/>\n&gt; into word games, shaming her at times (I didn&#39;t consciously intend to...I<br/>\n&gt; was ashamed it camed out that way).  In my roller coaster ride,  I was<br/>\nstill<br/>\n&gt; pushing her...only it became more subtle usually.  Or I&#39;d think...ok,<br/>\nI&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; been patient for 6-7 months,  and that hasn&#39;t &#39;worked&#39; (meaning it didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get me what *I* wanted - her to read AND enjoy it!)<br/>\n&gt;     Intead of allowing her the freedom to learn when,  how,  as much as<br/>\nSHE<br/>\n&gt; chose,  I was trying to get her to meet MY expectations.  When she was 8,<br/>\n&gt; dh and I even devised a *plan* to have her tested if she couldn&#39;t read by<br/>\n&gt; age 9.  Then it was,  we&#39;ll start a stringent structured program by age 9;<br/>\n&gt; then it was....maybe I&#39;m not handling this right,  maybe we should pay a<br/>\n&gt; tutor.  Well, all this didn&#39;t settle well with me.  And whenever it came<br/>\nup,<br/>\n&gt; dd felt like she had disappointed me,  like a failure.  She was stressed<br/>\nand<br/>\n&gt; tense about reading and &#39;tried&#39; to do it for me....yet became increasingly<br/>\n&gt; resistant.<br/>\n&gt;     When I examined this situation more closely,  I realized I had some<br/>\n&gt; major de-schooling to do of my own thinking.  I had to examine how<br/>\n&gt; mainstream ideas had infiltrated my thinking about how it&#39;s my *job* to<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; sure she knows certain things.<br/>\n&gt;     And your post almost exactly states my thinking on it.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe you&#39;ll not be able to understand unless you go through it.  But I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; wrong in my attitude and it only harmed my dd.  She was not truly allowed<br/>\n&gt; the freedom she neede in this area (i.e., NOT unschooling) until I had<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; breakthrough in my thinking and attitude.<br/>\n&gt;     I need to go now......I hope you can look at this with an open mind!<br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
