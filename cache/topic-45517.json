Now that I<br/>\n&gt; have two, I am strongly believing more and more every day that 2 is my<br/>\n&gt; personal limit.  I love my children with everything in me.  I spend<br/>\n&gt; practically 24 hours a day with them and I treasure every second (even<br/>\n&gt; those hard ones).  However, I am realistic.  My children wear me out.<br/>\n&gt; My children cost A LOT!  There are times with two when I am home alone<br/>\n&gt; that I cannot physically meet both of their needs.  How would I do this<br/>\n&gt; with more than what I have?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I feel the same way about the 2 boys that I have (who are 9 & 11). I am<br/>\nSO glad to have them and it&#39;s such a wonderful experience watching them grow<br/>\nup and sharing life with them. BUT, I also know that I would have a hard<br/>\ntime having another one or two or three (yikes!) children. I would become a<br/>\nphysical wreck, I think. I would end up really resenting being a mom and I<br/>\nthink it would take all the joy out of motherhood for me, personally. Having<br/>\nbabies was an awesome experience but NOBODY could talk me into having more.<br/>\nSleepless nights, feeling like a zombie, more mouths to feed, diapers,<br/>\netc... no thanks, I&#39;m done. I am thankful that those days are behind me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make me a bad, selfish mother? I don&#39;t know but I just really love<br/>\nand appreciate the life we have right now. Our &quot;little&quot; family unit is just<br/>\nperfect, IMO. OTOH, if I were to get pregnant by accident at this point, I<br/>\n*would* embrace my new baby - I just wouldn&#39;t do it if I had a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I love seeing happy and healthy large families.  Those that are<br/>\n&gt; fulfilled seem SO fulfilled.  I envy them.  I look at them and see<br/>\n&gt; children that aren&#39;t as demanding as mine and I think that perhaps that<br/>\n&gt; is HOW their parents were capable of being good parents to the number of<br/>\n&gt; children in their family.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Me too. When I see a mom with a large family, I truly respect and honor her<br/>\nfor having whatever it takes (that I don&#39;t have) to raise those kids. More<br/>\npower to her and her husband. It&#39;s a wonderful thing, I&#39;m sure. Just not for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45324,"nextTopicId":45495}}
