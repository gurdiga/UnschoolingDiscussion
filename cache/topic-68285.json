Susan Bundlie <br/>\narranged it, when Keith was working up there and the rest of the family had <br/>\ngone to visit him.  I remember it as a kind of dreamy, overcast, still day, <br/>\nand the group was very quiet, and it was one of those days that I would <br/>\nremember in that &quot;Did that really happen?&quot; kind of way.

But a couple <br/>\nof years later I got an e-mail from someone talking about how that had <br/>\nchanged her life, and so I thought, &quot;Oh!  I guess it DID happen!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s kind of an exaggeration on the reality of it, but there was an oddity <br/>\nto the whole deal.  (I hope I&#39;m not the only one who has had that feeling <br/>\nabout something, or you guys will think I&#39;m crazy!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Minnesota, but not enough to want to trade New Mexico in on it. (And <br/>\nNew Mexico might not even have made the down payment! It&#39;s cheaper to live <br/>\nhere, and I already know how.
