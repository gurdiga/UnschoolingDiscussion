Anyway, we have recently purchased a CD player for <br/>\nupstairs so that she can sing and dance whenever she wants.  Well, <br/>\nthis morning, we were singing and dancing around upstairs together <br/>\nand, all of a sudden, I had a flashback to my childhood.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to love to sing and dance when I was younger (as a matter of <br/>\nfact, I took ballet, tap and jazz classes into my teens).  My mom <br/>\nhad this wrap around skirt that I would wrap around my dance leatard <br/>\nand spin and kick around the house for hours.  My cousins, brother <br/>\nand I would even make up skits to go along with the songs and <br/>\npreform them for our parents.  I had completly forgotten about this <br/>\nuntil this morning.  It&#39;s not the first time that we&#39;ve danced <br/>\ntogether but, for some reason, this childhood memory came back to me <br/>\ntoday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD and I had so much fun this morning that I&#39;m even thinking of <br/>\ntaking some dance classes at the local community center.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":88511,"nextTopicId":88709}}
