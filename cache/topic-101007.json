That was really nice, and my kids (7, 5 and 4) were enjoying <br/>\nrunning around with her two little girls, maybe 5 and 3 or 4 and 2. The <br/>\nmom was telling me there were kids of all ages in the group, though they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t come during the day, of course, because they were in school. I <br/>\njust smiled and nodded and thanked her.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we were done exchanging info and that mom was trying to get herself <br/>\nand her kids ready to go, I could hear her yelling at them in the hall <br/>\nto sit still, I&#39;m-tired-of-this kind of stuff, etc. and I was thinking <br/>\nto myself, &quot;no, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joining those playgroups.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Julia and I went to the bathroom while Sam and Em stayed in the <br/>\nfoyer with one of our LLL leaders, and when I got back, the MOM&#39;s group <br/>\nmother was looking at Emily, saying &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you mean&quot; <br/>\nwith a puzzled look on her face. I said something like oh, what did she <br/>\nsay kind of thing, and the lady said, &quot;She said that you don&#39;t ground.&quot; <br/>\nI just laughed and said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t punish,&quot; leaving the astonished <br/>\nwoman in my wake as I went to retrieve the rest of our stuff from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other LLL leader followed me in and related that the MOMs group <br/>\nwoman was yelling at her daughters and telling them not to move from <br/>\ntheir chairs or get up again, so Emily walked over and very politely <br/>\ncomplimented the woman on her jacket, told her that her mommy had the <br/>\nsame jacket, but that her mommy didn&#39;t ground her kids.  *roflmao*  The <br/>\nother leader and I were laughing so hard (quietly); she was just <br/>\ncracking up that Em first did the whole fashion comment and then segued <br/>\ninto the whole punishment thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEm&#39;s concept of getting in trouble is when either dh or I are unhappy <br/>\nwith one of them and maybe speak sharply, but she&#39;s getting the idea <br/>\nthat other parents out there &quot;ground&quot; and punish their kids, including <br/>\nspanking, much of this from cartoons and such. Two neighborhood girls <br/>\n(11 and 9) have also told her all about grounding, to which Em <br/>\nsupposedly responded, &quot;Well, my mom doesn&#39;t ground.&quot;  The girls told her <br/>\nthat&#39;s because she was still young and that I would start soon!

Up <br/>\nuntil now it&#39;s mostly been really relaxed but now he&#39;s in with <br/>\nthe &quot;1st and 2nd graders&quot; and the teacher in the class is anice <br/>\nperson but a former public school teacher with a very teacher <br/>\nmentality still. I was nervous. And sure enough, the second week of <br/>\nclass, she came to tell me that DS got really upset when she asked <br/>\nhim to do his memory verse and he said I don&#39;t remember and he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t get another chance at it after the other kids went - that&#39;s <br/>\nnot the &quot;rule&quot;. For each verse they do, they get a mark and anyone <br/>\nwith a full set of marks gets to go out to Taco Bell at the end of <br/>\nthe quarter. Whooppee! lol. So, when we got home, I asked DS about <br/>\nit (I was flipping irritated that he didn&#39;t get a second chance but <br/>\nI held my tongue until I got the whole picture). We generally go out <br/>\nto restaurants about once a week, so I asked him how important this <br/>\nwas to him and what part was important. He wanted to do it to show <br/>\nhe could do it, it did have importance for him. Now we write it on <br/>\nthe chalkboard in the kitchen and review once or twice a week. Then <br/>\nwe get there early so he&#39;s the first kid in class and I give him the <br/>\nfirst word and he does fine from there. Then I head out to my class <br/>\nand all is well. (BTW she had a &quot;make up&quot; week as well where they <br/>\ncould catch up on any they missed so he&#39;s all caught up now and <br/>\nquite happy to point it out to me when I go to his classroom).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone on some list spoke of how Jesus taught.

To <br/>\nbe honest I am not sure about the verses that speak of spanking. <br/>\n(i.e. if you beat a child he will not die, etc.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly they are in the Old Testament, often in Proverbs. Jesus was <br/>\nmore likely to say Let the children come to me than to rebuke a <br/>\nchild for acting like a child. You never get a picture of kids being <br/>\nshy or nervous around him and he even encouraged grown ups to be <br/>\nmore like them - open, honest, caring, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Has anyone else felt that they were working on &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re always working on it - we like to joke that raising kids is a <br/>\nlot like battling the Borg (Star Trek FYI) - they adapt - just as <br/>\nsoon as you figure out one thing, everything changes and you have to <br/>\nfigure things out again.

For example, I had an incident in Sunday School, where there was a reward system. At one point I had planned an adult devotional and I had brought a tape recorder. My son was playing with it and messing with the music - so I asked him to please stop. He didn&#39;t stop right away and the SS leader came and told him he was taking away one of his &quot;stickers&quot; or whatever they were for not obeying his mom. I was so angry. This type of thing has happened several times. Each time I spoke up about it, but the leader clearly thought I was in error and he was &quot;helping&quot;. I apparently don&#39;t have the type of kids who sit all in a row, silent for hours. Other kids do this - so I wonder if I am doing something wrong, etc. A lot of the other parents who are not &quot;Unscho!<br/>\n   olers&quot; but many are homeschoolers do spank, and use rewards and punishments. The harder I tried to get away from those things, and the more I tried to give more control to my children for their choices, the more often that behavior became a point of contention. However, we are not talking about screaming or noise during the service, but usual &quot;kid noise&quot; and behavior. So, I had great conflict with the SS leader and the increasing amount of rules towards children at the church. (No markers, must sit with parents for dinners, etc.) There were issues with certain families that these rules were meant to address, however by making blanket rules, it really did not make for a child friendly environment. If they were really following Biblical Principles they would have gone directly to the people who were &quot;offending&quot; and spoke to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What the difficulty was, was that my take on all of this was different from everyone else. Most parents liked what the Sunday School was doing as far as rewards and started using them in their home. They liked the rules - because they could tell their kid &quot;It&#39;s just the rule&quot;. I have a problem with senseless rules. So, although  its not a &quot;faith&quot; issue ( and I have since changed my meeting hall as we have moved) I do think that Unschooling makes you look at children differently and see them not as objects to force into subjection, but people  that deserve respect in their own right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have ongoing issues and questions as I develop an Unschooling mindset. I have found that it is not enough to just not &quot;do a curriculum&quot;. It encompasses how we treat our children throughout life. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Someone on some list spoke of how Jesus taught. He used stories, things of interest to his audience, hand -on miracles, etc. I don&#39;t see where he praised people for their rigidity or for spanking.  To be honest I am not sure about the verses that speak of spanking. (i.e. if you beat a child he will not die, etc.) Words change meaning over time - and often the original word in the Hebrew of Greek is not even translated the way it should be, so it takes a bit of digging and prayerful consideration to figure it out. What I do know, is that I don&#39;t feel comfortable with this(spanking) and my own kids. I don&#39;t feel that because other Christians look at child raising in a certain way, that I have to agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have found it difficult to undo much of what I learned or read about raising children.  I have found people within my faith, that are raising their children like me, which has helped. It has also helped enormously to read what other homeschoolers post, and describe within their own families. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I would also say that some of the Christian ideas are difficult alongside homeschooling. Sometimes, I don&#39;t know if I just have one foot on either side of the fence. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Has anyone else felt that they were working on &quot;unschooling&quot; - as far as interactions within the family -(not the academic side) letting go of restrictions or controls measure etc. Maybe this question does not make sense to those that are truly unschooling - but for me in trying to do this it seems to be a continual process.  And throughout this process I find myself questioning my previously held &quot;norms&quot; in looking for a better way in treating my children as people. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Heather<br/>\n    ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n    From: Jason & Stephanie <br/>\n    To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n    Sent: Thursday, November 11, 2004 10:49 AM<br/>\n    Subject: Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Christian and Unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I did join a Christian unschooling list.

It&#39;s hard for me to understand how those folks <br/>\nwho want unconditionally obedient children could get unschooling to work <br/>\nin their families.
