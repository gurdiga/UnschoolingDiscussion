It&#39;s always easier to talk <br/>\nabout real situations. Do you have a situation that makes you believe you <br/>\nare unable to unschool with your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe I just don&#39;t get this all perfect or nothing sense... maybe I&#39;m just<br/>\n&gt;too new at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it has to do with perfect. Geez, I&#39;d never be able to do it <br/>\nthen. ;-) But there is a great amount of letting go of preconceived <br/>\nnotions-the ones we don&#39;t even realize we have-that makes unschooling much <br/>\nmore accessable than people would like to think. So each time someone  posts <br/>\nwith a &quot;but what about...&quot; we go in and explore (sometimes uncomfortably) <br/>\nthose notions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not smugness. It&#39;s not my way or the highway. It&#39;s more of a &quot; been <br/>\nthrough that, overcame that.&quot; You can disagree or be uncomfortable with what <br/>\nsome of us are saying, but it doesn&#39;t change the results we see in ourselves <br/>\nand our families.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAdd photos to your messages with MSN 8.
