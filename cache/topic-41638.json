I had turned on the <br/>\nclosed caption feature of the TV because I couldn&#39;t catch the lyrics to a <br/>\nsong on one of the shows he was watching and he and I wondered about <br/>\nthem.  I had left the CC feature on and forgot about it.  I had turned it <br/>\noff when my husband had rented a video and he found the CC <br/>\ndistracting.  Sure enough, Liam complained that it was off and wanted it <br/>\nback on.  He likes to watch certain tapes over and over again, and he is <br/>\nrecognizing words (like &quot;pleasure&quot;) from seeing the words as they&#39;re spoken <br/>\non his favorite Power Rangers tapes (he knows the dialogue by heart).  He <br/>\nalso loves for me to read to him, and while he is no reader right now, I <br/>\nhave no doubt at all that he will be when he is ready to be; this list has <br/>\nshown me over and over again what the meaning is of &quot;live and let live.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~marji~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108691200,"authorName":"Kimber","from":"&quot;Kimber&quot; &lt;snibbor@...&gt;","profile":"twoangels_jj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"reading and tv","postDate":"1029932740","msgId":41638,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWMyNDkwZCRkZDRmZWI0MCQyZGJkZmVhOUBkZWZhdWx0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41642,"prevInTime":41637,"nextInTime":41639,"topicId":41638,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-683738180\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I frankly don&#39;t care if you sit on the couch all day and watch TV, its your business not mine.

He was in school 1/2 year in kindergarten, homeschooled a year ( we used 100 Easy Lessons), then he went back to school for last half of 1st grade and all of 2nd, and 3rd.  (He will not return to school unless he chooses to go.)  He &#39;learned&#39; to read on his own by watching tv.  Yes, .....tv.  Last summer(he was 8) he wanted to know when his favorite shows would be on so he learned to read the TV Guide channel.  I was so surprised!  He still doesn&#39;t like to read books, unless it&#39;s to his younger sister at her request, but he will read magazines such as &quot;Outdoor Life&quot;, and any comic book he can get his hands on.  Due to his poor reading skills in 2nd grade, the school put him in an afterschool program to help him with reading for 3rd. Well, since he taught himself during the summer, he had surpassed his other &#39;remedial&#39; classmates and is now an excellent reader.
