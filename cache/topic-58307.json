Not like tonguing on a clarinet or oboe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, they learned to tongue and now I can&#39;t convince them to let it go <br/>\non runs.  To &quot;sing&quot; the parts as though they were singing the lyrics, and not <br/>\nto tongue right in the middle of a held vowel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey look at me.  They understand what I&#39;m saying in English and they would <br/>\nLIKE to play it so that it sounds more musical, but they&#39;re stuck with an <br/>\nover-learned habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3013","postDate":"1044745205","msgId":58307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNkI0QTAzLjFERjMlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDQ3NDI4MjYuMTYyMi41MjQ3My5tNUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":58313,"prevInTime":58306,"nextInTime":58308,"topicId":58307,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"2/8/03 23:20: ...
