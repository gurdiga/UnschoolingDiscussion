I was in AP math all through high school, I kept <br/>\ntelling the guidance counselor that I was going to art school, no <br/>\nmath was required and they only offered math classes as an elective <br/>\nbut I tested well so she pressured me to keep taking math at higher <br/>\nlevels. I never brought the book home, I only did homework at school <br/>\nand only then when I was in the math mood. I never studied for a test <br/>\nor made any effort to memorize a formula. It was fun but I thought I <br/>\nwas just wasting my time. Then a couple of years ago my son had an <br/>\nalgebra book and I picked it up and realized just how much of the <br/>\nthinking patterns I learned from higher math I actually do use in <br/>\neveryday, non-math situations.

For <br/>\n&gt; instance,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I need to buy wood chips to put in childrens play area. The mulch <br/>\n&gt; is sold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by cubic yard. The play area is approx. 25&#39; by 40&#39;. I think the <br/>\n&gt; mulch<br/>\n&gt; &gt; should be at least 12&quot; deep. How many cubic yards of mulch do I <br/>\n&gt; need? I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want the answer, just the formula, and a source for other <br/>\n&gt; formulas<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm. I&#39;m not sure that a book of formulas would help. It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; understanding the<br/>\n&gt; problem that will lead you to the formula. (Though most almanacs <br/>\n&gt; have them.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Basically what you&#39;re asking is if you had one size box and wanted <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; reshape it into a bunch of cube shaped boxes of a particular size, <br/>\n&gt; how many<br/>\n&gt; cubes would you have?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a number of approaches.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could visualize slicing every cube 3 times so each is 3 flat <br/>\n&gt; boxes<br/>\n&gt; stacked on top of each other. And then visualize (or draw it on <br/>\n&gt; graph paper)<br/>\n&gt; how many of those slices would fit into the play area.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since the slices from the cubes and the play area are both 1 foot <br/>\n&gt; deep you<br/>\n&gt; can ignore that you&#39;re dealing with 3 dimensions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So how many 3 foot squares fits across the 25 foot side? To make it <br/>\n&gt; easier<br/>\n&gt; so you don&#39;t have to deal with fractions you can deal with &quot;close <br/>\n&gt; enough&quot;<br/>\n&gt; and say more than 8, less than 9. And how many across the 40 foot <br/>\n&gt; side? More<br/>\n&gt; than 13, less than 14.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 8x13 is 104 and 9x14 is 126.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s too broad a range, so I&#39;d go back and fill in the real <br/>\n&gt; numbers and<br/>\n&gt; use 8 1/3 x 13 2/3 = 113.8888 so call it 114. The trick is you need <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; remember you used *slices* not whole cubes. So there&#39;s 3 slices per <br/>\n&gt; cube<br/>\n&gt; whic means you need to divide 114 by 3 which is 38.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Or you could you could figure out the volume in cubic feet of the <br/>\n&gt; play area<br/>\n&gt; and then keep subtracting 1 cubic yard&#39;s worth (3&#39;x3&#39;x3&#39; is 27 cubic <br/>\n&gt; feet)<br/>\n&gt; until you don&#39;t have any left. (That&#39;s also known as division ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 24&#39;x40&#39;x1&#39;=1000 cubic feet<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1000/27 is 38.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

I&#39;m not sure that a book of formulas would help. It&#39;s understanding the<br/>\nproblem that will lead you to the formula. (Though most almanacs have them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what you&#39;re asking is if you had one size box and wanted to<br/>\nreshape it into a bunch of cube shaped boxes of a particular size, how many<br/>\ncubes would you have?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a number of approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could visualize slicing every cube 3 times so each is 3 flat boxes<br/>\nstacked on top of each other. And then visualize (or draw it on graph paper)<br/>\nhow many of those slices would fit into the play area.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the slices from the cubes and the play area are both 1 foot deep you<br/>\ncan ignore that you&#39;re dealing with 3 dimensions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how many 3 foot squares fits across the 25 foot side? To make it easier<br/>\nso you don&#39;t have to deal with fractions you can deal with &quot;close enough&quot;<br/>\nand say more than 8, less than 9. And how many across the 40 foot side? More<br/>\nthan 13, less than 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n8x13 is 104 and 9x14 is 126.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too broad a range, so I&#39;d go back and fill in the real numbers and<br/>\nuse 8 1/3 x 13 2/3 = 113.8888 so call it 114. The trick is you need to<br/>\nremember you used *slices* not whole cubes. So there&#39;s 3 slices per cube<br/>\nwhic means you need to divide 114 by 3 which is 38.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you could you could figure out the volume in cubic feet of the play area<br/>\nand then keep subtracting 1 cubic yard&#39;s worth (3&#39;x3&#39;x3&#39; is 27 cubic feet)<br/>\nuntil you don&#39;t have any left.

Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>\n<br/>\nthey can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>\n<br/>\nboiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>\n<br/>\nthe moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>\n<br/>\nbut the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>\n<br/>\nedge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>\n<br/>\napplications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>\n<br/>\nlottery or statistics in elections or sports.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see the<br/>\n<br/>\nneed for modeling in the first place.

In the process of finding the<br/>\n<br/>\nbroken circuit, we talked about TV signals and waveforms and how both audio<br/>\n<br/>\nand video came from the same antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of<br/>\n<br/>\nelectronics (really complicated modeling), but he now is a little more<br/>\n<br/>\ninterested in just how that stuff works.
