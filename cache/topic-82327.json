Dice, game markers, <br/>\nmarbles, little Barbie or Ninja Turtle parts--the stuff we&#39;d find and pick up and <br/>\ncarry around until we got a chance to put them where they really went.   <br/>\nSometimes diaper pins or mom-supplies were in there too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs scattery as I am about stuff, I&#39;m happy to see that my boys take after <br/>\ntheir dad in keeping their wallets extremely well organized.  I haven&#39;t really <br/>\nexamined carefully, but once in a while I pick up a wallet to see whose it is <br/>\n(or USED to, they rarely leave them anywhere random anymore) and was amazed at <br/>\nthe organization!  Or sometimes one will hand me his wallet to get some money <br/>\nout for him or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got both Kirby and Marty state ID cards (like a driver&#39;s license for a <br/>\nnon-driver) years ago so they could ride the city bus as students (proof of age <br/>\nand photo), and got them wallets to carry them in.  They are amazing <br/>\nwallet-organizers.  Cool!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut me, pockets full of this&#39;n&#39;that.  Desk full.  Little cups and bowls full <br/>\nof stuff I might refile someday.  Three junk drawers, not counting the battery <br/>\ndrawer in the hall (full of junk for hanging pictures and repairing stuff and <br/>\nglue) and the bathroom drawer (lots of non-bathroom stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":82324,"nextTopicId":81913}}
