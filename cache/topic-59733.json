You can see the wonderfulness in your son  and be patient with these things.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The reason I am feeling this right now is that I have a friend right now whose son is acting out in ways that others would see as &#39;unacceptable&#39;.  He&#39;s in kindergarten and having a hard time with schedules and potty training and all that.     Well,  instead of allowing her son to be himself and grow with that, she is opting to making home an unattractive place so he wants to go back to school.  I&#39;m sooooo sad for him.       He would thrive so well in a homeschooling/unschooled environment, but his mom thinks that the school is the best way to get him into shape.     To me its like breaking his spirit.  Poor guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So,  thank goodness you know of unschooling and I&#39;m sure its a phase and with your patience he&#39;ll flourish and grow to be a wonderful boy!<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s lucky to have you as his mom!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kelli<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Manon (Hotmail)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:manon_brisson@...\">manon_brisson@...</a>&gt; wrote:--It&#39;s okay.

He is spirited and lately <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;he seems to love to do anything he is not supposed to be doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Hi Manon. It&#39;s been many years since I have parented a 2 1/2 year old, but <br/>\n    I&#39;m still parenting a spirited child. She&#39;s 9 now and the joys and <br/>\n    challenges just get more interesting as she gets older. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;He will go in the room and close the door telling me not to come in and <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;either pee on the floor or eat paper or write on the walls.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know this must be so frustrating for you, but this just brought such a <br/>\n    smile to my face. I keep picturing your obviously bright, active, intense <br/>\n    little guy doing what he can to stir things up. I mean what better way to <br/>\n    get mom&#39;s attention than to give her advance notice of what&#39;s coming? :o) <br/>\n    Easy for me to say, it&#39;s not my little one peeing on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n    At 2 1/2 I would think he&#39;s just doing some &quot;what happens if&quot; <br/>\n    experimentation. My experience has been that these kinds of behaviors pass <br/>\n    and it&#39;s best not to get too upset. Just deal with each one as they come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;We don&#39;t have a lot of rules (just what I consider essential). I know the <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;problem might be in my reactions as I will sometimes yell or overreact <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;when I just can&#39;t take it anymore. I usually try to remain calm and <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;explain to him why I don&#39;t like him doing that.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    We all yell sometimes. Just be mindful the next time and in this moment. I <br/>\n    would also try to redirect him before he gets the chance to be alone to do <br/>\n    his mischief. When he asks to be alone and you know what&#39;s coming, I&#39;d give <br/>\n    him a hug and a smile and try to get him interested somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &gt;&gt;Sometimes it almost seems as if he wants me to go in the room and take the <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;paper or whatever out of his hands while he has a good cry in my arms. <br/>\n    &gt;&gt;It&#39;s like he&#39;s begging me to take control. What would you guys do? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    I&#39;d try to anticipate when he was going to act out and redirect. If he did <br/>\n    something inappropriate I&#39;d tell hime why it was not okay and get to <br/>\n    cleaning up or fixing the situation. If he needed me to hold him for a good <br/>\n    cry, I&#39;d make that my first priority. I&#39;ve found that my 9 yo still needs a <br/>\n    good cry now and then. It&#39;s like she&#39;s got excess energy and doesn&#39;t know <br/>\n    what to do with it. Sometimes we can&#39;t work it out with physical activity <br/>\n    and attention. Sometimes she just needs to vent. It&#39;s okay. It will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Life is good.<br/>\n    ~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    _________________________________________________________________<br/>\n    Protect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

He is spirited and lately <br/>\n&gt;&gt;he seems to love to do anything he is not supposed to be doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Manon. It&#39;s been many years since I have parented a 2 1/2 year old, but <br/>\nI&#39;m still parenting a spirited child. She&#39;s 9 now and the joys and <br/>\nchallenges just get more interesting as she gets older. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He will go in the room and close the door telling me not to come in and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;either pee on the floor or eat paper or write on the walls.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know this must be so frustrating for you, but this just brought such a <br/>\nsmile to my face. I keep picturing your obviously bright, active, intense <br/>\nlittle guy doing what he can to stir things up. I mean what better way to <br/>\nget mom&#39;s attention than to give her advance notice of what&#39;s coming? :o) <br/>\nEasy for me to say, it&#39;s not my little one peeing on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 2 1/2 I would think he&#39;s just doing some &quot;what happens if&quot; <br/>\nexperimentation. My experience has been that these kinds of behaviors pass <br/>\nand it&#39;s best not to get too upset. Just deal with each one as they come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We don&#39;t have a lot of rules (just what I consider essential). I know the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;problem might be in my reactions as I will sometimes yell or overreact <br/>\n&gt;&gt;when I just can&#39;t take it anymore. I usually try to remain calm and <br/>\n&gt;&gt;explain to him why I don&#39;t like him doing that.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We all yell sometimes. Just be mindful the next time and in this moment. I <br/>\nwould also try to redirect him before he gets the chance to be alone to do <br/>\nhis mischief. When he asks to be alone and you know what&#39;s coming, I&#39;d give <br/>\nhim a hug and a smile and try to get him interested somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes it almost seems as if he wants me to go in the room and take the <br/>\n&gt;&gt;paper or whatever out of his hands while he has a good cry in my arms. <br/>\n&gt;&gt;It&#39;s like he&#39;s begging me to take control. What would you guys do? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d try to anticipate when he was going to act out and redirect. If he did <br/>\nsomething inappropriate I&#39;d tell hime why it was not okay and get to <br/>\ncleaning up or fixing the situation. If he needed me to hold him for a good <br/>\ncry, I&#39;d make that my first priority. I&#39;ve found that my 9 yo still needs a <br/>\ngood cry now and then. It&#39;s like she&#39;s got excess energy and doesn&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat to do with it. Sometimes we can&#39;t work it out with physical activity <br/>\nand attention. Sometimes she just needs to vent. It&#39;s okay. It will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nProtect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963\">http://clinic.mcafee.com/clinic/ibuy/campaign.asp?cid=3963</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1853,"nextTopicId":59880}}
