The reason my husband and I chose to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2050147452\">My kids have never been in school.  My oldest will be 11 years next <br/>\nmonth ... so I&#39;ve been doing this roughly 7 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason my husband and I chose to homeschool isn&#39;t because of one <br/>\nissue:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  My daughter had a very profound autistic-like response to <br/>\nstrangers when she was very young.  She was reading at three and was <br/>\nexceptionally bright in other areas as well.  Her cognitive skills <br/>\nwere above average and she was tall for her age.  She is also very <br/>\npretty ... her father is Latin and she takes after him in skin tone, <br/>\nhair coloring, and some other features.  The issue was that while she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t shy with family and people she knew well, too many people in <br/>\nthe room or strangers elicited a very profound response from her.  <br/>\nShe appeared to completely shut down --- no facial expression, <br/>\nunfocused eyes, completely still physically, would stop in midstride <br/>\nor in the middle of whatever she was doing.  We decided that it would <br/>\nhave been too traumatic to put her in school until she outgrew this.  <br/>\nAnd, she did outgrow it by the time she was six ... but in Florida, <br/>\nkindergarten in mandatory and she would have had to go to school when <br/>\nshe was five years.  We have since found out that many children who <br/>\nshow &quot;giftedness&quot; at an early age also deal with sensory overload <br/>\nissues ... this can come out in hyperness, tics, etc.  My daughter&#39;s <br/>\ncase was extreme but she did outgrow it with no problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  At the time we could not afford private school and the public <br/>\nschool where she would have attended was (and is) one of the worst in <br/>\nthe district.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  While I am a product of public school, my husband is a product of <br/>\nprivate school.  His opinion is that most kids that attend private <br/>\nschools are the ones that couldn&#39;t make it in public school or got <br/>\nexpelled.  Now my opinion isn&#39;t that radical, but spouses must <br/>\ncompromise.  So, even though we could now afford to send the children <br/>\nto private school, it is our opinion ... reviewed often ... that they <br/>\nare best educated at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve added reasons over the years ... anyone in Florida knows the sad <br/>\nstate of our school system.  And living in the Bay area we also deal <br/>\nwith issues of random and daily violence, rape (even in middle <br/>\nschools), drugs, gangs, teen pregnancy, etc.  Not every school is <br/>\nbad, not every publicly schooled kid is warped ... I&#39;m just not <br/>\nwilling to subject my kids to the possibility of them coming into one <br/>\nof these situations until they have the emotional grounding to be <br/>\nable to face it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also issues of governmental interference with parental <br/>\nrights and what is being taught in today&#39;s classrooms ... with and <br/>\nwithout parental consent.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., marbleface@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 05/19/2001 10:15:07 PM !!!First Boot!!!, <br/>\nparrishml@a... <br/>\n&gt; writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; .
