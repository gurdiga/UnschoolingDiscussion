She was very active on the boards and email groups as well.  I had quite a few confrontations with her, none ended nicely I might add.  She would advocate that all these new homeschoolers out there be following her &quot;plan&quot; for their young children and basically they were behind if they didn&#39;t fill those expectations.  I made a point to counteract each and every of Michelle&#39;s posts on boards or email lists that I was on to let people know that there is another way and that they should thoroughly research her ideas of early education before embarking their little charges with a full academic schedule as she prescribed.  Anyway, she finally faded away and I am happy to say that her website is no longer running so hopefully less and less people will be influenced by her ideas.<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: LisaBugg <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 19, 2001 9:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pre-schooler skills+<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I found this under the two year old section<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Holds a crayon correctly when coloring.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sort of hoping Michele Lewis is not on our list, because this is pure<br/>\n  bs.  I have had 4  2yr olds pass through my home and there&#39;s no way you can<br/>\n  say a *2* year old needs to be able to do this.  And who gets to define<br/>\n  correctly?  When in that second year is this a supposed need?  3 days after<br/>\n  the birthday when they are still babies? OR the day before they turn 3 and<br/>\n  you&#39;re missing that baby face you knew so well?   We won&#39;t even go into the<br/>\n  wide maturation differences inherent in boys and girls.  I had one son that<br/>\n  was a &quot;baby&quot; until shortly after his 4th birthday.  He didn&#39;t lose his baby<br/>\n  face, nor his baby ways until then.  He wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t &#39;slow&#39;, he&#39;s just<br/>\n  himself..  He didn&#39;t speak until 4ish either, and then he spoke in complete,<br/>\n  complicated sentences.  He hated to color or draw until about the age of 8<br/>\n  and just last week, at now 11,  he asked me for a drawing class.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I read through the rest of the list and realized that what I disliked most<br/>\n  about the infomation there was the tone in which things were presented.  I<br/>\n  offered the children all of these things and more, I just didn&#39;t fret over<br/>\n  the idea of having them master or prove the skills.  I trusted that they<br/>\n  would want to write and color and sing and waxh hands and learn to read.  I<br/>\n  trusted their inate ability to love me and trust me and talk to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She also thinks 4 year olds shoud understand the concept of sin and<br/>\n  forgivness. I know learned adults who disagree on these concepts. I know<br/>\n  Christians and Jews who hold diametrically opposed definitions of these<br/>\n  concepts.   4 year olds shouldn&#39;t even know the word sin, IMNSHO.<br/>\n<br/>\n  i didn&#39;t think much of the site to tell you the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Original Message -----<br/>\n  From: &quot;Dalene Mactier&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Mactier@...\">Mactier@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 19, 2001 4:16 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pre-schooler skills+<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; BlankHi All<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Someone pointed me to this list of skills to be mastered by 2, 3 and 4<br/>\n  year olds.
