It really bugs<br/>\nme how some in this world go, go, go even with sick kids in tow!  So<br/>\nmany parents seem to be in complete denial of their children and<br/>\nunderestimate their need for safety, security, quiet and CALM.  You&#39;re<br/>\nsmart at this point to keep a low profile.<br/>\nBaby will be back to himself in no time and I wish you continued success<br/>\nwith the nursing!<br/>\n<br/>\nSonia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkalima wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for all the advice.
