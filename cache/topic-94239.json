THEN 15 -30 MINS IN THEY WANT TO LEAVE.  IT TOOK US GOING TO THE CHEAP THEATER, RENTING IT TWICE AND THEN BORROWING FINDING NEMO FROM A FRIEND BEFORE THEY SAW THE WHOLE THING.  THEN THEY SAID HOW MUCH THEY LIKED THE MOVIE.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHEY ARE STILL VERY YOUNG AND MAYBE THEY JUST NEED THAT GRADUAL INTRODUCTION TO MOVIES AND NEW SITUATIONS?  THEY ARE 4YO AND 2YO.  BUT IT SEEMS THAT THEY USED TO, AT LEAST MY OLDEST USED TO ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND WATCH A WHOLE MOVIE AND CHECK THINGS OUT LONGER.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE KIDS REALLY SEEM INTERESTED IN SHREK 2, BUT I AM GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE CHEAP THEATER (AT LEAST).<br/>\n<br/>\nLIVING AND LEARNING<br/>\nHOLLY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to think that the money was spent on exposing or introducing them <br/>\nto what was there so now they know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - what kind of museum are you going to where they are bored with it <br/>\nthat fast anyway? Not the hands-on science and children&#39;s museums, <br/>\nsurely?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo kids want to leave movies that they have chosen to see, after the <br/>\nmovie starts? You&#39;ll have to describe that situation further - that <br/>\nseems unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old are the children we&#39;re talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94237,"nextTopicId":94241}}
