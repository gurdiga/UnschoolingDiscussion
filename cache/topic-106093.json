Wow!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry at ALL about the personal hygiene<br/>\nthing - after what <br/>\nhe&#39;s been through, it isn&#39;t that big a deal and, trust<br/>\nme, it is VERY <br/>\nvery very common among boys his age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have sons, but I have 3 daughters 14, 17,<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhi again,<br/>\nI have a son, and I agree with the above. I do think<br/>\neverything is a deschooling-moving to unschooling<br/>\nissue as the lifestyle change from ps is so radical.<br/>\nsomeone said that something went wrong a long time ago<br/>\nthat had nothing to do with schooling.<br/>\nI felt that things had gone wrong a long time ago with<br/>\nmy son as well, namely his dad&#39;s alcoholism and my<br/>\ndeppression during his infancy, which is why I saw<br/>\ndeschooling as a second infancy, now that I was<br/>\nfeeling much better and not reacting to his dad.<br/>\nnow I think that school is so much a part of our<br/>\ncultural experience and even babies go to daycare and<br/>\nare expected to sleep alone that pretty much<br/>\neverything relating to parenting is related to<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\nAnna<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
