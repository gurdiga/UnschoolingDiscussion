There are a lot of people who say &quot;We are <br/>\nlargely vegetarian&quot; or &quot;we rarely eat meat&quot; but it isn&#39;t a religion for them. <br/>\n Total vegetarians are probably sorry for them that they&#39;re not getting the <br/>\nmaximum benefit, and wish they wouldn&#39;t say &quot;vegetarian&quot; just because they <br/>\nonly eat chicken and fish but avoid pork and beef.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I am more than justified calling<br/>\nmyself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>\nweek, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>\nfeel like it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are acting like an unschooler all but in that thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut inside you there must be other doubts and scheduling situations, I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking.  If you really believed children could and would learn all the <br/>\nthings they need, then you would not think to assign with a deadline a math <br/>\nworksheet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not justifying my calling myself an unschooler.  I&#39;m not being anything <br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t be an unschooler???&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSURE you can be!

If you said &quot;Do you know your times tables?&quot; <br/>\nyou would get cow looks, but Kirby explained simply and quickly to some other <br/>\nkids at the gaming shop last month how to multiply by 18 in your head, and <br/>\nthey got it and were glad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool doesn&#39;tids have figured out 6% (sales tax) in their heads since they <br/>\nstarted getting allowance.  It&#39;s easy.  Doing it the written-out school way <br/>\nis NOT easy.  They can figure tax, but the wouldn&#39;t be able to do that <br/>\nworksheet right now.  Someday, maybe.  Someday, because they understand in <br/>\ntheir gut what 6% means, and 30% (the discount Kirby&#39;s employment earns them <br/>\nall at the gaming shop), they&#39;ll be able to plug those numbers into the <br/>\nequation and see easily how to figure out 19.7 percent.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if they had had to learn the formula first, if I had TAUGHT them 6% in a <br/>\ndecimals way, or in a fractions-equation way, they would probably think they <br/>\ndid not know, nor were they smart enough to know, how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wants to be an engineer, it will probably be because math is easy <br/>\nfor him, because his mind and soul are full of patterns and causes and <br/>\neffects.

This is my first year unscooling and to me it is the ability to choose what I think is neccessary at that time.  I am obviously no expert, but I have found a very real sence of self in the last few months, when it first occured to me that the most wonderful things in life do not come from textbooks and fire drills.  All of the pros kept flowing with few doubts at all.  I found all that I need to know on the message boards at unschooling.com and here in my mail box.  Oh, the fact that my hubbie loves the idea too really helps.  So all of that aside, I love most the idea that I CAN drill and &quot;test&quot; and give &quot;assignments&quot;  I CAN also deside what to drill and how.  I have quickly learned how to &quot;test&quot; for knowledge and if they are &quot;getting&quot; it.  I have also seen how they love to apply what they have learned in the &quot;real world&quot;.  They don&#39;t need to do it on paper or sitting down or even be in a quiet room.  Once they think they ha!<br/>\nve got it, I let go try it out.(ie. grocery shopping, going on ther own throught the store, reading signs and lables, finding all of the things on the list, counting all the way.  They feel so grown up and they act so grown up too.  They seeped the reward from searnig things that are boring in text books and run through quickly and catered only to one style of learning...the rarest kind.  I like to teach them and they (usually) like learning.  As soon as they get bored or aare too frustrated, then that lesson is over, and what to do next.  I ask them all day over and over, questions about what they did learn.  They get it down eventually.  I must say that in the last 3 months of (mostly summer break) my dd has moved up 2  &quot;reading levels&quot;  i don&#39;t really care much, but her teacher tried for 9 months and couldn&#39;t do it.  it sort of proves me right, YK?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has gotten way too long, but I am so excited about my new found adventure<br/>\n<br/>\nI will go with that<br/>\n<br/>\nchavva<br/>\nmother to<br/>\nashley nicole 7<br/>\nJessica Lorrain 4<br/>\nSeth daniel  almost 2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrie Troy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TCA1120@...\">TCA1120@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&lt;&lt;I think that would be like saying that as an omnivore, you use a<br/>\n&gt;vegetarian approach with some bites and a carnivorous approach with<br/>\n&gt;others.

My name is Elizabeth and I m a mother of three, ages 11, 9, and 2 1/2. My 9 year","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-636214080\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\n   I just joined this group and thought I should introduce myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Elizabeth and I&#39;m a mother of three, ages 11, 9, and 2 <br/>\n1/2. My 9 year old daughter is currently living with her dad in <br/>\nCalifornia, but the two boys both live with me near London, England. <br/>\nThe 11 year old is now in his second (non-consecutive) year of <br/>\nhomeschooling. The littlest can&#39;t quite be said to be &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>\nuntil he is &quot;school age&quot; I suppose, but he is definitely learning <br/>\nlots... that being the thing kids do and all. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy situation is probably a lot different from most in one key way -- <br/>\nI am not a full-time stay at home mom, and neither is my partner. The <br/>\nlittle one goes to a childminder every morning plus two afternoons a <br/>\nweek and the oldest often comes with me to the office or out to <br/>\nmeetings. I do have the luxury of being able to get most of my work <br/>\ndone anywhere (since I&#39;m building Web site software and such), so at <br/>\nthe moment I work from home three days a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first year of homeschooling was frought with myriad fights over <br/>\nthe time it took Noe to get work done. That boy has an amazing way of <br/>\nmaking a simple task turn into a two hour long chore and it grates on <br/>\nme like nothing you can imagine. Last year Noe went back to a regular <br/>\nschool -- a very good one, mind you, where he was quite happy and <br/>\neverything -- but he still managed to nearly flunk all of his <br/>\nacademic subjects. I could listen to him talk for hours about <br/>\neverything he was learning, but he simply didn&#39;t turn assignments in, <br/>\nand could not make the grade. This year I realized that there was <br/>\ngoing to be no education at all if it wasn&#39;t a self-guided one. He <br/>\nhas to want to learn what he&#39;s learning, there has to be a purpose to <br/>\nit in HIS mind, and then I have to get out of the way and let him get <br/>\nto it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment there are a few things that are paramount in his eleven <br/>\nyear old brain: 1) Warhammer 4000 games (a role playing game with <br/>\nminiatures and things)  2) Sci-Fi fantasy stories/movies/art and his <br/>\nown inventions based on same and 3) his personal quest to be <br/>\nfinancially independent by the age of 12 (one month away). While none <br/>\nof these seem very sensible or realistic to me (though I do love the <br/>\nsci-fi!), I&#39;ve been looking for ways to use them as hooks to get him <br/>\nto learn subjects that he needs. I&#39;ve used the role playing games as <br/>\na way to get him to study history and write about it -- to make new <br/>\nscenarios. I&#39;ve used his desire to create sci-fi type &quot;inventions&quot; of <br/>\nhis own to teach him math (by way of mechanical drawing to design <br/>\nthings) and science (by way of the details he needs to create a <br/>\ntheoretically functioning &quot;invention&quot;). And I&#39;ve finally decided to <br/>\nlet him loose with his entrepreneur&#39;s bug and have hooked him up with <br/>\nYoung First Tuesday so that he can start a business of his own(which, <br/>\nby the way, he has been bugging me about since he was 6!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m nervous as all get out...  I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t learn things <br/>\nquickly enough. I&#39;m afraid he won&#39;t be able to keep up with others <br/>\nwhen (if?) he goes back to school or when he goes to university. I&#39;m <br/>\nworried sick that he will forever find ways to make a ten minute math <br/>\nassignment take 3 hours. And so, here I am to learn from all of you <br/>\nvery wonderful and confident (or at least more experienced?) <br/>\nhomeschooling parents.  :) <br/>\n<br/>\n- elizabeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23191,"nextTopicId":23231}}
