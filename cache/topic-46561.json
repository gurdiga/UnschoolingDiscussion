We <br/>\nwill plan his learning together, based on his interests, so I can&#39;t state in <br/>\nadvance which specific topical areas we will cover, however we expect to <br/>\ncover the following subjects.<br/>\nHe will read from self-chosen and parent-chosen literature on a daily basis. <br/>\nHe will engage in reflection on those literature pieces in one or many of the <br/>\nfollowing ways: journal writing, book reviews, conversations, drama based on <br/>\nthe books, book clubs. My goal is for Brandon to continue to enjoy reading, <br/>\nto read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide variety of genres, and to be <br/>\nable to reflect critically on what he reads. <br/>\nBrandon will read content-area non-fiction materials as needed to support his <br/>\nchosen areas of interest. He will reflect on these pieces in one, or many, of <br/>\nthe following ways: journal writing, writing an article for submission to a <br/>\nmagazine, discussions, development of a scrapbook in an area of interest. My <br/>\ngoal is for Brandon to learn to read critically for information, to <br/>\nunderstand and be able to reflect on the materials he reads and to be able to <br/>\ncompare them to other sources of information, and to learn how and where to <br/>\nfind written resources as needed.<br/>\nBrandon will study science as it relates to the areas of his interests by <br/>\nwatching science videos, reading related written materials, conducting <br/>\nscientific experiments, gardening, keeping journals, making and recording <br/>\nobservations, visiting scientists in their work places, taking classes at the <br/>\nDayton Museum of Discovery, participating in science fairs, earning science <br/>\nmerit badges through Boy Scouts, visiting museums such as COSI and the <br/>\nIndianapolis Children’s Museum and through cooperative classes with our <br/>\nhomeschool group. My goal is for Brandon to experience a wide range of <br/>\nscientific exposure in his areas of interest, to develop a positive interest <br/>\nin science, to learn to think scientifically, to develop a respect for the <br/>\nwork scientists do and to understand the importance science has in his daily <br/>\nlife.<br/>\nWriting, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of Brandon&#39;s writing <br/>\nprocesses. He expects to write creatively, to write letters and lists, to <br/>\ncreate and write drama pieces, etc. He will also write in conjunction with <br/>\nBoy Scout merit badges. My goal is for Brandon to enjoy writing, to gain <br/>\nskills in both the writing process and in technical skills required of an <br/>\nedited piece, and to develop a sense of power over the written word.<br/>\nHistory and geography will follow the same plan outlined for the above <br/>\nsubjects. Brandon will read historical fiction and non-fiction, participating <br/>\nin field trips such as the Renaissance Festival, Carillon Park, Union Station <br/>\nin Cincinnati and the Fair at New Boston. We expect to integrate history and <br/>\ngeography into our study of other subjects through one or many or the <br/>\nfollowing ways: the use of time lines and maps, discussion, journal writing, <br/>\ncooking, plays, road trips, invention building, Scout camping trips and art. <br/>\nMy goal is for Brandon to appreciate the nuances and fluidity of history, to <br/>\nrecognize his place in history, and to enjoy and understand the importance of <br/>\nhis knowledge of history.<br/>\nHealth, physical education and safety will be continued as a part of our <br/>\ndaily living skills. Brandon will learn to care for his body and his physical <br/>\nenvironment through one or many of the following ways: shopping for and <br/>\npreparing food, discussing the necessity of a healthy diet, participation in <br/>\nfire drills and other emergency preparedness, exercise both as play and as <br/>\npart of a structured group experience, and through Boy Scout camping, merit <br/>\nbadges and classes. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate the necessity of a <br/>\nhealthy body and to learn to care for his body&#39;s needs as he understands them.<br/>\nBrandon will learn art and music through both self-chosen and structured <br/>\nmethods including one, or many, of the following: art classes at Rosewood, <br/>\nDAI, or the K-12 Gallery, piano and guitar lessons, choral singing, listening <br/>\nto various styles of music, learning through reading and videos about the <br/>\npeople who have influenced music through history, and working on self-chosen <br/>\nart projects and Boy Scout badges that relate to music and art. He has been <br/>\nand will continue to be active as an actor and performer in various community <br/>\ntheaters in the Dayton area. My goal is for Brandon to appreciate a wide <br/>\nvariety of art and music experiences, including performance, while <br/>\nunderstanding the importance of art and music as it pertains to history. In <br/>\naddition, he will be spending time at our family framing and print store <br/>\nwhere he will meet a variety of artists and learn about many facets of the <br/>\nart business.<br/>\nBrandon will learn math through participation in daily living—cooking, <br/>\nbuilding, shopping, etc. In addition, he will continue using the Key to…math <br/>\nseries for algebra and geometry as well as Mathematics a Human Endeavor and <br/>\nAlgebra by Harold Jacobs. My goal is for Brandon to gain conceptual knowledge <br/>\nof mathematics as well as an appreciation for the daily application of math <br/>\nin his life. <br/>\nList of basic teaching materials. <br/>\n<br/>\n*   encyclopedias <br/>\n*   dictionaries <br/>\n*   atlases <br/>\n*   reference books and materials ( such as textbooks, field guides, grammar <br/>\nbooks, timelines, globe maps, etc.) <br/>\n*   newspapers <br/>\n*   magazines (including Muse, Zillions, Boys Life, Reader’s Digest, <br/>\nNewsweek, Scientific American Frontiers) <br/>\n*   library loan books, tapes, magazines, etc. <br/>\n*   educational games <br/>\n*   educational computer software and on-line services <br/>\n*   calculating and measuring tools and utensils <br/>\n*   art, craft and writing supplies <br/>\n*   musical instruments <br/>\n*   audio-visual equipment and materials <br/>\n*   religious materials <br/>\n*   science lab equipment <br/>\n*   sports equipment <br/>\n*   kitchen equipment <br/>\n*   gardening tools <br/>\n*   carpentry tools <br/>\n*   home maintenance equipment <br/>\n*   community resources (such as museums, stage performances, sports <br/>\nprograms, private lessons, volunteer opportunities) <br/>\n*   Boy Scout materials <br/>\n*   live animals—dog, rats, horses, etc <br/>\n*   garden and yard</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Betsy","from":"Betsy &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;how to&quot; question for parents of high  school/middle school age kids","postDate":"1034819407","msgId":46648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNEQUUxNzRGLkM0MUE2NTQ3QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyNzU3YyRlYzk4OGMxMCQ3OThiMzNjYkBoYWxsYW0+"},"prevInTopic":46646,"nextInTopic":46921,"prevInTime":46647,"nextInTime":46649,"topicId":46561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**When the law of your state has specific requirements, how do you ...
