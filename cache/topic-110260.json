I happen to <br/>\nbe a *huge* fan of animal fur, so I tried on the brown mink stole (it <br/>\nhad a clippy under the mouth so it could &#39;bite itself&#39; to stay in <br/>\nplace!) and a beautiful white mink coat.  I walked around for a while <br/>\njust petting myself; I was incredibly gleeful when they said I could <br/>\nhave the coat!!!  I asked Hannah, 9, to bring it downstairs for me, she <br/>\nrefused to touch the fur (agreed to transport it by touching only the <br/>\nsatin lining), and gave me a huge opposing spiel on fur.   She&#39;s seen me <br/>\nooohing and aaaahing over vintage furs many times, but we had never had <br/>\na discussion.  It was *SO* cool to debate purposefulness after death (my <br/>\njustification) and animal cruelty.  She wouldn&#39;t buy my &quot;but this is <br/>\ntheir purpose in life and I&#39;d hate to deny them their one true purpose&quot; <br/>\nand she came back with if one were to eat the animal, it would be right <br/>\nand proper to use the fur and the other parts as needed, as in leather. <br/>\nI so enjoyed the exchange and am so impressed with her ability to hold <br/>\nher own opinions in the face of mine.  I realized too, that although I <br/>\nwant my kids to think for themselves, I had always assumed they would <br/>\ncome to the same (highly logical &lt;g&gt;) conclusions as me -- it&#39;s so cool <br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t and even cooler that she didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t feel she <br/>\n*has to*!!<br/>\nThis original discussion resurfaced a few hours later as we talked about <br/>\nour aging kitty and my desire to tan her hide and create a wall hanging <br/>\nout of her (or a muff, or a hat, or slippers &lt;bg&gt;), which led to a talk <br/>\nabout cremation and her desire to add Patches&#39; ashes to her &#39;collection&#39; <br/>\n(she has some of her dad&#39;s ashes) and some to sprinkle at the cat&#39;s <br/>\nbirth home, which led to talking about Mitch and what his perceptions <br/>\nwould be of our life right now, which led to a discussion on my dad and <br/>\nhis relationship with Mitch, which led to a discussion on grieving (&quot;I <br/>\nreally like talking to you about daddy when you aren&#39;t crying about <br/>\nit&quot;), which led to plans for our Death Day celebration (ala Nearly <br/>\nHeadless Nick) this coming Saturday...

I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple weeks, but this is my first<br/>\npost here. My 10yo boy/girl twins have been homeschooling for almost three<br/>\nyears. We&#39;ve been gradually evolving to an unschooling environment, with a<br/>\nbig leap over the past month or two. We&#39;re all more relaxed, enjoying each<br/>\nother&#39;s company, and exploring many new interests together. DH and I are<br/>\nalso finding that we&#39;re starting to naturally ease up on non-homeschool<br/>\nrules because they just don&#39;t seem to apply anymore. Bedtime has become much<br/>\nmore relaxed -- I&#39;ll remind the kids if we have obligations the next day<br/>\nthat might prevent them from sneaking in a mid-day nap, but I leave the<br/>\ndecision of when to go to sleep to them. Tonight, they&#39;re sleeping in the<br/>\nfamily room with the dogs because they wanted to have a &quot;slumber party&quot;<br/>\ntogether. Meals have become a more cooperative effort, and the kids are<br/>\ntaking more interest in learning about nutrition as we give them a voice in<br/>\nchoosing what we&#39;re going to make for dinner and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a question, though. My daughter and I were discussing The Giver<br/>\nlast night. She loves that book, and we&#39;ve talked about it many times over<br/>\nthe past year or so. Last night, I shared a viewpoint that was different<br/>\nfrom hers, and she immediately said she agreed with me. When I asked why she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t maintain her position, as the story could easily be interpreted<br/>\neither way, she said she didn&#39;t like disagreeing with me because I&#39;m an<br/>\nauthority figure. This shocked me. DH and I have never been the sort of<br/>\nparents who demand unwavering discipline or agreement. My mother lives<br/>\nnearby and is often here for dinner, so the kids see a living,<br/>\nmulti-generational example of how we can respectfully debate and<br/>\noccasionally disagree with each other, especially as we all love to discuss<br/>\ncurrent events and books and whatnot. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone offer advice on how we can encourage our daughter to stand up for<br/>\nherself and feel free to question without turning this into a &quot;lesson&quot; and<br/>\nmaking a big deal of it with her? I don&#39;t want to make her even more<br/>\nself-conscious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nJenn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":83236,"nextTopicId":110331}}
