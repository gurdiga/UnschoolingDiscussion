I myself had an <br/>\nallergic reaction to the pill, and when I became pregnant with our son, we <br/>\nhad used a condom.  I think it is very important to make sure young men and <br/>\nwomen truly understand all of the risks involved, even when using <br/>\nprotection. I think a lot of them think that these work 100% of the time, <br/>\nand they do not. It takes more than putting your daughter on the pill or <br/>\nbuying your son a box of condoms.   Though freer access to birth control <br/>\ncan go a heck of a long way towards cutting down, open communication and <br/>\nhonesty with our children about their sexuality could go a long way too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Here&#39;s to a better and more compassionate world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Annette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I second that fully!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nTake no heroes,<br/>\nOnly inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nPiston Ported Vespas:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.piston-ported.hompage.com/index.html\">http://www.piston-ported.hompage.com/index.html</a><br/>\nwords<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html\">http://www.geocities.com/vespass/words.html</a><br/>\nST Louis Secular Homeschooler&#39;s Co-Op<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org\">http://www.stlsecularhomeschool.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"29kCoCUO1NeZBvncxMWNAfEeggYGSPddK2KTXmj3XVcB2HMeItt4p6NUIjsmAGLNze9Ph-t2XoBJ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] thanks sandi","postDate":"981228080","msgId":15874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZhLmIwMWY0YjcuMjdhZGI0MzBAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15870,"nextInTopic":15921,"prevInTime":15873,"nextInTime":15875,"topicId":15870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/3/01 11:45:14 AM, naake1999@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1155004896\">In a message dated 2/3/01 11:45:14 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:naake1999@...\">naake1999@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; your long post on your experience with abortion and your <br/>\nearly pregnancy was the most compassionate and meaningful thing I have read <br/>\non that subject EVER. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnette wrote that, but I agree totally.<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to have the snapshots of people&#39;s life stories, but quite a <br/>\nmore powerful thing to have the experience laid out in order, long term.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Annette Naake","from":"&quot;Annette Naake&quot; &lt;naake1999@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"ghbC-UrigU21hjAPyf_t8jNaOOk-udFaDAJ_E5Xwy4YRWH4q_wW6M76p4Q1Z6YujRZTfwS_v1OWjCSAsZoox6ZCfdS_4S10ahfhjuZq-","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"thanks sandi","postDate":"981224958","msgId":15870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PExBVzItRjIyMjljTFBzUTJiTjIwMDAwMzJlYkBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15874,"prevInTime":15869,"nextInTime":15871,"topicId":15870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Sandi, I want to say that your long post on your experience with abortion and your early pregnancy was the most compassionate and meaningful thing I have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-748891926\">Dear Sandi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to say that your long post on your experience with abortion and your <br/>\nearly pregnancy was the most compassionate and meaningful thing I have read <br/>\non that subject EVER.
