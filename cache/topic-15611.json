The oddest \n<br>thing about  this reverse-salary scheme is that you actually \n<br>enjoy it and wish you could only do more. \n<br>\n<br>BENEFITS: \n<br>\n<br>While no health or dental insurance, no pension, no tuition \n<br>reimbursement, no paid holidays and no stock options are \n<br>offered, job supplies limitless opportunities for personal growth \n<br>and free hugs for life if you play your cards right. \n<br>\n<br>Forward this on to all the MOM&#39;s you know, in appreciation for \n<br>everything they do on a daily basis, and let them know they are appreciated. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br></font></font></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15602,"nextTopicId":15614}}
