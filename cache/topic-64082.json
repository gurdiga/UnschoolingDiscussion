She {being about 4 or so}said remembered when she had different parents but her sister {then a very young toddler} was her sister before, and she had a brother but her parents were different. She talked about her house and family and drew pictures. She remembered dying as well. {as far as I know she had nothing to give her ideas and I didn&#39;t praise her for this information, just listened and it was before I talked about them coosing me as a parent, which is what I believe} Now, later she doesn&#39;t remember it as well {she is 9 now} and we don&#39;t talk about it as much because she doesn&#39;t seem interested.My personal belief is we have things to learn and we carry over many things from previous lifetimes {that is one thing my MIL who is Christian and I do agree on}. My youngest from the time she was an infant has never liked to feel she is restrained, to the extream. She has basicly been EXTREAMLY clostraphobic since she was a tiny baby. And she was determined not to be enclosed {like of I had something to do and I tried to put her in a safe place til I could get it done. She would break out in a matter of a couple of minutesAll my children from the time they were born came in to this world with very different things that made them who they are. I learned the best way for us was for me to honor those differences so they could really trust me. And so they do. :)Tracy<br/>\n<br/>\ncoyote&#39;s corner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a>&gt; wrote:When Brianna was around two and a half years old, she, along with my wonderful aged (late) aunt and I were at a local mall.

It&#39;s off the beaten track. I went to this town on instinct. I described to the people I was with. I even described the area on the far side of town and two of the structures - one of which was long gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW-- have you read Nag Hammadi Library?<br/>\nAre you aware that in non European versions of the bible - reincarnation is mentioned?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you aware that many other people wrote of the life, times, death and resurrection of Jesus? Did you know that not all of these gospels were put into the New Testament? Some were rejected by Constantine & his wife for very political reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often point out to people that through out history, people have believed in a great many religions. Each and every religion had very devout followers. What is the difference between a family of ancient Athens. A family that truly, in their heart and spirit knew - that Athena would/could bestow this ; they knew that the Labyrinth would do that - what is the difference?? So very many religions have taught re-incarnation. Furthermore - if you look at the natural world - everything is recycled - why not souls??<br/>\nSee - that, to me - makes perfect sense.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:grlynbl@...\">grlynbl@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 11, 2003 10:51 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] christians again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 4/11/03 9:15:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jana@...\">jana@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Hmmm...if I may, I have been here before.

We have, in the past bought this plastic junk - doesn&#39;t last, wastes money and it&#39;s made in China and shipped here. We&#39;ve discussed the energy it takes to manufacture, to transport and how, when we buy this stuff - we are &#39;voting&#39; for this company that is disrespectful/destructive of the environment.<br/>\nFurther more, we also discuss how much money we have and what we really want to do with it. Sure, she may want this $4.99 toy or that .99 cent candy bar - but more and more, she&#39;ll say - herself- no, I&#39;d rather save the money. A few months ago, her bio-mom was shopping w/ us. She was buying her other two kids some junk toys. Brianna said she&#39;d rather have the money - Thank you very much -she told her bio-mom that the company exploited the planet and the kids and that she&#39;d rather save her money for her animal refuge  that she wants to build.<br/>\nAnother aspect of this -- I don&#39;t buy chips. We both gave them up and we save the money. It&#39;s about $15.00 per month. At the end of the year, we&#39;ll invest it somewhere, somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we are on the pow wow trail. We know people that have little or nothing. Many reservations are like third world countries. So we try to spend wisely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for manners. Again, on the pow wow trail - manners are everywhere. How we act & interact w/ elders, how we act & interact w/ other kids. There&#39;s no cutting ahead in line; there&#39;s no interrupting; lies are not tolerated as it hurts the People. Things like that. I find the pow wow trail very, very helpful in her development.<br/>\nJanis<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sorcha <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, April 11, 2003 10:34 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] christians again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; You&#39;re in a store and your child wants something you don&#39;t have the<br/>\n  money <br/>\n  for or you don&#39;t think they need (candy, toy, etc &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  When we&#39;re in the check-out aisle and my kids are drooling over the<br/>\n  candy, I say something like, &quot;I know.
