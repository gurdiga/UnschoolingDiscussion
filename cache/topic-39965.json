Writing is a small motor skill. Casey has <br/>\nalways been a small motor skill kind of gal. She also likes to work with <br/>\nthose teeny tiny seed beads, so small you use a needle to pick them up. <br/>\nThat&#39;s just her. Writing has been a joy for her and so she&#39;s used it, <br/>\npracticed it and played with it. Like I said, it looks very schooly even <br/>\nthough I never pushed schooly thought on her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Conor is 13 now and still hates the physical act of writing. He can <br/>\ntell stories, play online games and type slowly, but writing just tires his <br/>\nhands. I often wonder if he avoids it so much because it was forced on him <br/>\nso young when he was still in school. :-/ I think lots of kids, boys <br/>\nespecially, come to writing later rather than sooner. Playing, using those <br/>\nbig muscle groups, are what these kids need to be doing. When they have a <br/>\nneed to begin writing, it will be so much easier to help them when they&#39;re a <br/>\nlittle older and not so intimidated by those small motor skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://messenger.msn.com\">http://messenger.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39858,"nextTopicId":39968}}
