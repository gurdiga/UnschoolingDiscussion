By and large, children have less freedom to live their<br/>\nlives as they choose than adults do.  My 3yo sometimes HAS to run errands<br/>\nwith me whether he wants to or not because there is no one to leave him<br/>\nwith.  He has a very serious medical condition and HAS to be forced into<br/>\nmedical procedures at times.  He is frustrated, has little understanding of<br/>\nthe need to endure pain to keep from getting sick, and has limited options<br/>\nin his behavior.  If he has a fit because he had to go with me to the<br/>\ngrocery store, I cut him some slack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf dh threw a fit, it would be different.  He doesn&#39;t have to go with me if<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want, he is basically free to live his life exactly how he<br/>\nchooses.  Major difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28588,"nextTopicId":28593}}
