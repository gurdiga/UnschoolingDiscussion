He mentioned how lucky my <br/>\nkids are that they have so much free time to &quot;do what they want,&quot; <br/>\nand my oldest asked him if he would homeschool if he was allowed to.<br/>\nHe thought about it and then replied that it was hard to say, <br/>\nbecause while he hates a lot of things about school (grades, <br/>\nhomework, boring classes) he&#39;d really miss his friends.  He *likes* <br/>\ngoing to school to see his friends.  I felt uncomfortable because <br/>\nthis is exactly the reason my kids sometimes think they&#39;d like <br/>\nschool, so I piped up &quot;yes, but don&#39;t you get in trouble for <br/>\nsocializing in school?  Are you even allowed to talk to your <br/>\nfriends?&quot; and he surprised me by saying that yes, they do socialize <br/>\nplenty throughout the day.  I could practically hear my kids making <br/>\na mental check in their pros of school column.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond conversation... my friend has a 12 year old daughter who goes <br/>\nto school, and this week they went out to dinner together (she and <br/>\nher daughter).  When they walked into the restaurant my friend had <br/>\nher arm around her daughter.  Turns out there were a bunch of girls <br/>\nfrom her class eating there (some school club dinner or other) who <br/>\nwitnessed the arms around each other thing, and this girl was so <br/>\nmortified that she didn&#39;t eat her dinner and went home and locked <br/>\nherself in her bedroom and cried.  All because her classmates saw <br/>\nher and her mother with their arms around each other!  That kind of <br/>\npeer influence and fear of criticism over such silly things just <br/>\nhorrifies me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Unschooling as not &quot;normal&quot;","postDate":"1053143941","msgId":69471,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMmMwMWMzMWMyYSQ4NDMyNTBjMCQwOTAwYThjMEB3ZXN0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQtRjE2akpNbFcxcVVQY3QwMDAwYmI4MEBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69447,"nextInTopic":69524,"prevInTime":69470,"nextInTime":69472,"topicId":69148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Most of her friends are still from school.  She is a very social","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1000195552\">Hi Lisa,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter will be 11 in July and she too went to school through the <br/>\nsecond grade.  Most of her friends are still from school.  She is a very <br/>\nsocial person.  That was the main reason why I put her in a preschool at <br/>\nthe age of 3!  Other kids to play with!  It&#39;s been a real struggle.  I have <br/>\nnoticed that there are a combination of factors involved with her <br/>\nunhappiness and wanting to return to school or at least wanting to be more <br/>\nlike her friends.  Depending on how isolated she felt (how successful she <br/>\nwas in getting someone to play with her), how active her current interests, <br/>\nthe weather (we live in the Seattle area),  future plans for out-of-state <br/>\nfield trips, and her medications (she has a mood disorder), all these would <br/>\nhave an effect on how much she would dwell on wishing she could be like the <br/>\n&quot;other girls,&quot; or conversely that there was no such thing as public school!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been deschooling now for almost 3 years, and it is only now that I <br/>\nfeel I can start to see some real positive changes in her.  She has begun <br/>\nto express interest in wanting to learn new things and is taking the <br/>\ninitiative.  The more successful she is at this, the less she compares <br/>\nherself to her friends.  She is very aware, however, of my opinion of the <br/>\nschool system and of the things she couldn&#39;t do if she were in it.  No <br/>\nfield trips, no sleeping in or staying up late, spelling tests, and doing <br/>\nmath, all the things she hates, still!  She also hears from her friends the <br/>\ncomplaints about the homework, and not being able to play and sees her <br/>\nbrother&#39;s friends (age 14) being expelled and failing for really silly <br/>\nreasons.  She is aware on a pretty regular basis of the failings of the <br/>\nschool system.  The positives of homeschooling, of unschooling, are also <br/>\nusually gifted to her on a daily basis in some way.  I think this also <br/>\nhelps her confidence and self esteem in realizing that she has the better <br/>\nif not more &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;normal&quot; choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite all this, when she gets together with a large group of schooled <br/>\nfriends like at Girl Scouts where she is the only homeschooled girl, she <br/>\nfeels very uncomfortable.  She says that she feels like they &quot;know <br/>\nmore.&quot;  I suspect it is because all the girls, being the same grade, are on <br/>\nthe same page and just can say the same things.  She feels left out and <br/>\ndifferent, which is the kiss of death in a group without any other <br/>\nsupport.  One other homeschooler would help, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s not done <br/>\nintentionally, I don&#39;t think, for I know the leader well.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nself-esteem thing, which she is only now beginning to form after all these <br/>\nyears.  She does have a few close friends in the group, but they don&#39;t <br/>\nrealize how she feels about this aspect and so don&#39;t know how to support <br/>\nher.  They&#39;re all only 10 after all!  But knowing this helps me understand <br/>\nwhy she wants to go independent next year.  We&#39;ll see what we do.  But <br/>\nwe&#39;ll talk about it and why she feels uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing like the rest of her friends is a big deal at this age.  Fortunately, <br/>\nbecause she is at home, that impulse is considerably diluted and presents <br/>\nitself in the type of toys that she may be interested in (Brats or <br/>\nBuild-A-Bears), rather than clothes, or language, or boys!  So I recognize <br/>\nthe impulse and am grateful for the lack of severity in the reality of it <br/>\nand go with the flow.  The same with the statements of &quot;wishing I could be <br/>\nlike so and so,&quot; or any other such thing.  I usually take that to mean <br/>\nsomething didn&#39;t go well today and she is unhappy with something, rather <br/>\nthan a real wish to change, and I go investigate.  Re your question about <br/>\nfitting in...I think that the more confident you are about yourself and <br/>\nyour abilities, the less you will care about &quot;fitting in.&quot;  Right now <br/>\nthough, it&#39;s a big deal.  An age phase for many.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to talk to my kids about the whole unschooling process.  Given the <br/>\nproblems that we had in public school, the process had to become a family <br/>\none.  It&#39;s necessary for us that it be a cooperative effort, especially <br/>\nwith a bipolar teen!  So, interesting articles on the public school system <br/>\nor colleges that I think my 14 yr old should hear are spoken about, and <br/>\nemails from this list are shared.  Maybe I talk too much (who knows how <br/>\nmuch they really choose to &quot;hear&quot; anyway!), but I figure they should have <br/>\nan idea of where I&#39;m going and what I&#39;m trying to do.  By now they know <br/>\nthat I&#39;m not perfect (boy do they!), and if they have something to say they <br/>\ncan...all part of the process, I figure.  Talk to your daughter, get her <br/>\nopinions, her complaints, her thoughts on solutions, etc.  Make her part of <br/>\nthe process and you will both be happier in the long run.  You are not the <br/>\n&quot;teacher&quot;!! so stop trying to come up with all the answers or the lesson <br/>\nplan!!   That&#39;s the SECRET!  There &#39;ain&#39;t&#39; one!

They don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the external rewards that school-kids, or school at home kids might<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get--grades, gold stars, completed workbooks etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It just occurred to me recently, that while I understood what we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing, they really didn&#39;t...they thought we were just slacking off,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; drifting about...and we were always VERY relaxed homeschoolers to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; begin with.  At any rate, I&#39;ve started sharing with them more about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; WHY we&#39;ve changed, what I don&#39;t like about the way schools work etc,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and it seems to give them a sense of understanding...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ahhh...there&#39;s a plan!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My older dtr said the other day about a rather controlling fellow HS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mom--&quot;She treats her dtr like she&#39;s a rat in a cage, giving her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rewards for good behavior.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just talking this out helps them see that we have CHOSEN this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lifestyle.
