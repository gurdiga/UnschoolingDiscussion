This is getting to be an utter waste of my time even if it is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1377757193\">It is my personal opinion that Ned is holding this list hostage for whatever<br/>\nhis own purpose is.<br/>\nThis is getting to be an utter waste of my time even if it is simply signing<br/>\non to delete all the insulting posts he writes.<br/>\nMaybe it is unfortunate, but since being off line for those two months of<br/>\nmoving, I did not get to read any of his posts that actually relate to<br/>\nunschooling so I can&#39;t wait hopefully for him to get back to them.<br/>\nIt is not his political views that I object to, as a matter of fact, I agree<br/>\nwith most of them. It is not the vehemence with which he expresses them.<br/>\nIt is the insults. The assumption that if we don&#39;t want to hear what he<br/>\nsays, we are non-thinking tools of the machine and slaves to our oppressors.<br/>\nThe offensive attacks on peoples choices because they are different than<br/>\nhis.<br/>\nI have been thinking alot about this.  Thank God I&#39;ve been UNschooling for<br/>\nthese years. If I came to this list as a newbie, I would think that the<br/>\nimportant part of unschooling was political volunteerism. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s OUR<br/>\nchildren.It is my daughter Emily, 8 who loves the freedom of figuring words<br/>\nout in her own time and telling me what they are. My son Max, who will never<br/>\nHAVE to see the inside of a classroom unless it is his own choice. My son<br/>\nZack, 14, who is as we speak, is sitting in 3rd period on his very first day<br/>\nof Highschool, and wants to be there, likes to be there, and is still<br/>\nextremely capable of making decisions all by himself about his own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am not going to just keep quiet and ignore. You want us to stand up to<br/>\nthose who are out to get us Ned? I will, I&#39;ll stand up to you. You<br/>\ncontinually respond to posts as if you are not deeply reading them. You<br/>\ndon&#39;t answer direct questions posted to you, you twist words into insults<br/>\nand your sarcasm levels are through the roof. You just don&#39;t care who you<br/>\ninsult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, this is a place for new people to come and ask questions. How in hell<br/>\nare they supposed to understand WHY hooked on Phonics is bad if their<br/>\nquestions about it aren&#39;t even answered and they were directed to a list<br/>\nfor school at homers.? What an incredibly important discussion that is,<br/>\nparticularly in light of the purpose of this list.<br/>\nHow we Unschool.<br/>\n~Elissa Cleaveland<br/>\n&quot;It is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction<br/>\nhave<br/>\nnot yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A.

I really didn&#39;t get that at all.  I understand many<br/>\ndidn&#39;t agree and are afraid of what newbies will think but in my experience<br/>\nby the time someone finds &#39;unschooling&#39; they have already learned a little<br/>\nof what Ned was speaking of (gatto and similar info.) anyway and it&#39;s not a<br/>\nbig surprise to hear someone here speak of these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me quite a while to learn to believe and trust in unschooling, I&#39;m a<br/>\nstubborn one.  &lt;g&gt;  It took far to long for me to get unschooling I tried<br/>\nwhat seems like almost everything to &#39;school&#39; at home.  It was posts just as<br/>\nNed&#39;s that kept me going and not send my child to school.  I don&#39;t read<br/>\nGatto or even Ned&#39;s posts much anymore but I know without these people I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be here on this list now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope posts like Ned&#39;s help others that might be in the same situation I<br/>\nwas once.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Olly Harari [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ollyharari@...\">ollyharari@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Monday, August 12, 2002 6:30 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A tyranny against speech<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI find Ned&#39;s posting to be interesting, thought<br/>\nprovoking and very much related to the essence of<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\nHelen, removing Ned from the list will be very<br/>\nundemocratic, unfair and anti unschooling. Why anti<br/>\nunschooling?  Because one of the reasons people choose<br/>\nto unschool is the belief that there is no<br/>\nprescription for learning, life or ideas and each one<br/>\nof us as an individual and as a community, create it<br/>\nas we go along with an open mind and tolerance to<br/>\nothers way of being. Removing Ned from the list is<br/>\nputting the unschooling ideas into a circle and<br/>\npunishing those, whom some of the list members think,<br/>\nare crossing the line. Such an action is assuming that<br/>\nthere are external prescriptions for unschooling. If<br/>\nwe keep an attitude of plentiful we can be a better<br/>\nforce for change.<br/>\nOlly<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nHotJobs - Search Thousands of New Jobs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotjobs.com\">http://www.hotjobs.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have questions, concerns or problems with this list, please email the<br/>\nmoderator, Joyce Fetteroll (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a> ) or the list owner,<br/>\nHelen Hegener (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Editor@...\">HEM-Editor@...</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nVisit the Unschooling website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
