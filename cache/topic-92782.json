What if someone knows","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-344566217\">[In response to the prot telling the therapist that there is no<br/>\ngovernment] &quot;What if no one notices that something needs to be done?<br/>\nWhat if someone knows something needs to be done but refused to do<br/>\nit? What if a person decides to do nothing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That doesn&#39;t happen on K-PAX.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Never?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What would be the point?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, to express dissatisfaction over the wages being paid, for one<br/>\nthing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t have &#39;wages&#39; on K-PAX. Or money of any kind.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI jotted this down. &quot;No money? What do you barter with?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t &#39;barter&#39;. You really should learn to listen to your<br/>\npatients, doctor. I told you before--if something needs to be done,<br/>\nyou do it. If someone needs something you have, you give it to him.<br/>\nThis avoids a multitude of problems and has worked pretty well on our<br/>\nPLANET for several billion years.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;At what age did you begin school?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There are no schools on K-PAX.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not surprised. But you are obviously an educated person.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am not a &#39;person&#39;. I am a being. All K-PAXians are educated.<br/>\nBut education does not come from schools. Education stems from the<br/>\ndesire to learn. With that, you don&#39;t need school. Without it, all<br/>\nthe schools in the UNIVERSE are useless.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One final question. You have said that your childhood was a happy<br/>\none. Did you have other children to play with?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Hardly any. There are very few children anywhere on K-PAX, as I<br/>\nhave indicated. Besides that, there is no distinction between &#39;work&#39;<br/>\nand &#39;play&#39; on our PLANET. On EARTH, children are encouraged to play<br/>\nall the time. This is because you believe they should remain<br/>\ninnocent of their approaching adulthood for as long as possible,<br/>\napparently because the latter is so distasteful. On K-PAX, children<br/>\nand adults are all part of the same thing. On our PLANET life is<br/>\nfun, and interesting. There is no need for mindless games, either<br/>\nfor children or adults. No need for escape into soap operas,<br/>\nfootball, alcohol, or other drugs. Did I have a happy childhood on K-<br/>\nPAX? Of course. And a happy adulthood as well.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once said, &quot;It is never to late to have a happy childhood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t childhood the most wonderful time!! I think that is when we <br/>\nare elated<br/>\nabout EVERYTHING and if we are *lucky* enough to appreciate, it sets <br/>\nthe tone<br/>\nfor the whole rest of our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how old we get,<br/>\nwe can always be truly young again by recapturing these times in our <br/>\nminds even<br/>\nif only for a moment or two and the joy it brings up our spirits! Ah!<br/>\n- the simple pleasures!!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":92780,"nextTopicId":92783}}
