Not<br/>\nsomething I ever want my children to experience again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis goal resonates with me as well.  I do see my daughter feeling guilty at times, and that is NOT what I&#39;m trying to do, ever.  It is probably the thing motivating me the most - the last thing I&#39;m trying to do is instill guilt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank-you for your story - you must have been really convinced about unschooling to dive into all of it at once!!  I have no one around me that unschools - which makes all of this changing more difficult for me.  The only local conferences are Christian based - which have seminars helping fathers to be the heads of their homes.  Honestly!  Some of my kids friends are not allowed over by their parents unless the kids are playing outside because they might play video games.  So, my kids will sometimes just not play with them because they&#39;d rather play video games.  I have removed controls around video games,  tv/movies, bedtime/sleep, and now I&#39;m working on the food thing.  I&#39;ve come along way with foods - and I&#39;m striving to continue sorting through my issues so they can benefit.  Since I&#39;ve really had to do each one very consciously and on it&#39;s own, I admire your ability to jump right in.  However, I also know for me, with very little support outside the home, taking it one step at a time is working very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104888,"nextTopicId":104910}}
