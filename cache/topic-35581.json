This is <br/>\nsomeone who uses the Calvert Curriculum -- playing math games was really a <br/>\nBREAK for her kids and fun for them. My younger daughter would play with us <br/>\nwhen her sister was having her lesson, she LOVES math and games and was happy <br/>\nto have me coming up with games and to have another kid to play them with, on <br/>\na regular basis -- my older daughter wasn&#39;t interested so she did something <br/>\nelse. The violin teacher&#39;s kids had to play - their mom was paying for it, by <br/>\ngiving my kids the violin lessons they wanted. They played eagerly and had <br/>\nfun. When I say &quot;math games&quot; - it was activities out of books like the &quot;Math <br/>\nfor Smartypants&quot; book by Marilyn Burns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomebody is helping my daughters build a dollhouse and I&#39;m tutoring her 16 yo <br/>\nin math because she wants to take the CHSPE. But we&#39;re friends - it isn&#39;t a <br/>\n&quot;trade&quot; - it is just her doing something with my kids because she likes them <br/>\nand wants to do it and me doing something for hers because I like them and <br/>\nwant to do it - but not &quot;in exchange&quot; -- we do all kinds of things together. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the best advice about this that I can think of is not to be too shy <br/>\nto just ask someone to help your kid out with something. IF the child wants <br/>\nto learn it - and the person has the expertise - they&#39;ll usually be happy to <br/>\nshare. It won&#39;t work out well if it turns out that it is the parent pushing <br/>\nthe child to learn it and the child isn&#39;t really interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have helped a number of teenagers learn to write an &quot;essay&quot; -- because they <br/>\nhave to do it on the CHSPE as well as study for the math part of the exam. I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do it if the parent came and said they wanted the kid to learn it, <br/>\netc. But I willingly and happily give up some of my scarce time to help any <br/>\nteenager who asks me themselves and says that THEY want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pamS<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"trading lessons","postDate":"1019485029","msgId":35581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI4LjI1Njk4ZTBkLjI5ZjU3NTY1QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35601,"prevInTime":35580,"nextInTime":35582,"topicId":35581,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/22/02 9:00:11 AM Central Daylight Time, Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-207729902\">In a message dated 4/22/02 9:00:11 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;  So the question remains unanswered, How do you go about finding <br/>\n people to &quot;trade lessons&quot; with if your kids want to learn something <br/>\n you can&#39;t help them with? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original post was asking about a younger child, and trading math for <br/>\nhistory or geography.<br/>\nI think the advice to not try and shunt these into subjects and try to make <br/>\nlessons out of them was right on......not at all like an older child that has <br/>\ndecided they want higher math or some specialized information the parent <br/>\nwould have a hard time helping them get.<br/>\nBut as to trading, if that&#39;s what you choose.
