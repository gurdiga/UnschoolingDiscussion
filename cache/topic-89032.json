I have followed the links presented and<br/>\nhave printed out some of them to read and re-read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am certain you will see more of me here!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a wee report.........Since I have decided to &#39;deschool/unschool&#39; with<br/>\nKristopher, things around our house have gotten way more relaxed.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nnoticed he is much happier.  He is already showing us that he will pursue<br/>\nwhat interests him.  I know he has already learned things that I would not<br/>\nhave &#39;taught&#39; him for some months yet!!  From the library, he brought home<br/>\na book about electricity, found an experiment he wanted to try.  He worked<br/>\nat gathering together the components he needed, and with a little assistance<br/>\nfrom his dad, he did his experiment successfully.  Then......he promptly<br/>\nwent to his computer and wrote out the instructions so that someone else<br/>\ncould do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone mentioned that if participating with our Charter School was not<br/>\nwhat we really needed that we could maybe quit it now.  I thought about<br/>\nthat, but for the present they do pay for Kristopher&#39;s tutor which I do wish<br/>\nto continue for a while.  He enjoys this time very much, and it is funny,<br/>\nbecause he has &#39;taught&#39; his tutor some things on her computer she didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to do!!  LOL  So..........I have decided that we can use the projects<br/>\nhe is doing on his own to send in to the Charter School for his files there!<br/>\nI just have to be certain we cover one way or another the &quot;four core subjects&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition.......Kristopher and his dad are receiving some financial assistance<br/>\nat this time from our county (his dad has a lot of medical struggles)....and<br/>\nwe have to have &quot;proof&quot; that Kristopher is in school!  Our Charter School<br/>\nprovides a letter of Kristopher&#39;s enrollment with them  (twice a year), and<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have any problems of someone knocking on our door to check on him,<br/>\netc.   So.......there are advantages!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the ideas and suggetions coming!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarol<br/>\n..grandma to Kristopher  (in CA)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":89022,"nextTopicId":89036}}
