As much as I love the time I spend with my <br/>\nchildren, I also need those few hours alone in the evening. DH works <br/>\nnights and I enjoy the time to myself, I wouldn&#39;t get it otherwise. <br/>\nWhen I was working I also needed time to come home and just veg for a <br/>\nfew hours and unwind from the day. With 3 under the age of 6 and one <br/>\non the way it is important for me to get some adult interaction even <br/>\nif it is watching something on t.v. that is more my age level. Blues <br/>\nClues 5X a day can drive a person insane. Also, the 3 and 5 yo love <br/>\nto play games and it is difficult with the 17mo running about trying <br/>\nto include himself in his own way. I have started putting him to bed <br/>\naround 7-7:30. That way I can play some games with the 3 and 5yo just <br/>\nbefore bedtime. We will either read or play Boggle, Jr., Memory, <br/>\nAlphabet Bingo, Shutes and Ladders or they can watch a short video. <br/>\nWe have some that are animated bible stories and only 30 min. They <br/>\nare great for a calm evening before bed time. Then around 8-8:30, <br/>\ndepending on when the baby went to sleep and how long he has actually <br/>\nbeen asleep, they go to bed and I take turns snuggling with them <br/>\ntalking about their day, singing and just getting them settled in <br/>\ntheir beds. Usually by about 9 they are calm enough to stay in bed <br/>\nand fall asleep on their own and I can have a nice hot bubble bath <br/>\nand read email or veg in front of the t.v. or read or whatever else I <br/>\ndecide to do. I do have a hard time when DH is off though. It tends <br/>\nto mess up our schedule. His idea of putting the kids to bed is <br/>\nsitting with them infront of the t.v. until they fall asleep. I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike this though because I have found that after a few weeks of this, <br/>\nthe kids either will stay up till all hours watching t.v. until I <br/>\nfinally come in and say it is time to get into bed (sometime this is <br/>\nas late as midnight or 1 a.m.) or they just refuse to go to bed. <br/>\nEither way it ends up interfering with the rest of the week&#39;s bedtime <br/>\nschedule and DH doesn&#39;t seem to understand this. He just knows that <br/>\nhe wants to spend some time with the children. I guess part of the <br/>\nproblem is that he is the type that has to have the t.v. on to relax. <br/>\nI on the other hand rarely have it on, except in the evening after <br/>\nthe kids are in bed. He is getting better about it though. I can come <br/>\nin and say, &quot;Let&#39;s play a game. Do you want to join us, DH?&quot; and he <br/>\nhalf the time he will turn off the t.v. and play the game with us at <br/>\nbed time. It is a constant battle though. Do I give in and eventually <br/>\ngive up the few hours I have for myself or do I be a stick in the mud <br/>\nabout the bedtime routine 7 days a week. I have found that if I do <br/>\ngive up my few hours to myself it affects the way I interact and <br/>\nrespond to the children.

We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of <br/>\n&gt;coercing.<br/>\n&gt;They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling <br/>\n&gt;(again)<br/>\n&gt;and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are <br/>\n&gt;ever<br/>\n&gt;going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we<br/>\n&gt;will probably never come across naturally (multiplying fractions, algebra,<br/>\n&gt;etc.)so, what happens if they want to take an SAT test later; I guess they<br/>\n&gt;just have to &quot;knuckle down&quot; and learn lots of math all at once THEN? I <br/>\n&gt;think<br/>\n&gt;I need a pep talk...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 745<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Date: 27 Aug 2000 09:47:22 -0000<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;There are 13 messages in this issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Topics in this digest:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;       1.

Were you a debater in school?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My husband observed after the last unschooling conference that we went to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that homeschooling, the research into it, the websites, the books, the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;conferences, the support groups, are overwhelmingly feminine in nature.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s completely understandable since moms are the primary <br/>\n&gt;homeschoolers.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He sees in talking with other hs dads, that there is often the attitude<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;homeschooling is the mom&#39;s job, and that the dad may have some concerns<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it, but if she&#39;s willing to commit to it, he&#39;s willing to &quot;give it a <br/>\n&gt;try&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But, they often take a wait and see attitude.  Then, as time progresses,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;becomes an advocate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This happened with my husband, too.  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;productive if we could bring these guys around sooner?  We could save so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;much<br/>\n&gt; &gt;emotional energy if we didn&#39;t have to deal with our <br/>\n&gt;job--homeschooling--and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with our partner&#39;s doubts, too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Carron<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Message: 7<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Sat, 26 Aug 2000 10:39:18 EDT<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Cararmst@...\">Cararmst@...</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Re: Questions from a Newbie/Behavior<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;In a message dated 8/26/2000 7:58:16 AM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mommiesapp@...\">mommiesapp@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, late that same month my ds was born so we were ALL<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  adjusting to life with a newborn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Wow, Michelle, that turns everybody upside down!

I guess I have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;been doing  the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is just going to  take some time.  I only started implementing the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;whole L&L ideas in January  of this year.  Also, late that same month<br/>\n&gt; &gt;my ds was born so we were ALL  adjusting to life with a newborn.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll keep up the choices and implementing my own if she doesn&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY keeping my voice<br/>\n&gt; &gt;calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer and I think I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I can relate REALLY well to this. I naturally have a loud voice since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;birth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;move away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;second of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so<br/>\n&gt; &gt;many kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt;talking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;keeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also<br/>\n&gt; &gt;learned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer<br/>\n&gt; &gt;calmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;controled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;tend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control<br/>\n&gt; &gt;in those frustrating times though. Think I always will.

Something clicked.  He came away telling me that kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;even think about academics until they&#39;re twelve, that the body of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;knowledge<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is changing so rapidly we can&#39;t possibly to hope to learn what we need <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;know in school or even homeschooling with a curriculum, that our kids<br/>\n&gt; &gt;will<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;learn what they need to when they need to -- period!.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Your husband has de-schooled. Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started<br/>\n&gt; &gt;out I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be<br/>\n&gt; &gt;fun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects<br/>\n&gt; &gt;into one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interesting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more <br/>\n&gt;likely,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;trying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I<br/>\n&gt; &gt;began my own de-schooling too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Now, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt; &gt;of the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn <br/>\n&gt;what<br/>\n&gt; &gt;they want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, <br/>\n&gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;seem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. <br/>\n&gt;So,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;we may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;telling them what they are to do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;School starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt; &gt;our garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this <br/>\n&gt;year<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video <br/>\n&gt;taped<br/>\n&gt; &gt;them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first <br/>\n&gt;day<br/>\n&gt; &gt;went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful<br/>\n&gt; &gt;family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting<br/>\n&gt; &gt;each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference <br/>\n&gt;there<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is now.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Cathie<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 28 Aug 2000 04:16:43 EDT<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:braunville@...\">braunville@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 745<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In a message dated 8/27/2000 11:25:03 PM Pacific Daylight Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starshine_lal@...\">starshine_lal@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am new to this site. I have a 10 year old and 13 year old and am <br/>\n&gt;curious<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  about what you all think, unschooling-wise, about: 1)SET TIMES FOR BED <br/>\n&gt;vs.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the <br/>\n&gt;computer/internet:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Depends on the needs of the family and the child(ren), IMO.  One of our <br/>\n&gt;main<br/>\n&gt;reasons to stay away from the ps thing is to have more control over our<br/>\n&gt;personal lives and better time to spend together as a family.  In our <br/>\n&gt;family,<br/>\n&gt;we all live by Dad&#39;s schedule because he is the one with a schedule set by<br/>\n&gt;outside influences (work).  DH has worked rotating shift work most of our<br/>\n&gt;lives.  When he&#39;s on a night shift he would totally miss any family time if<br/>\n&gt;we stick to a strict bedtime routine, especially when he works a swing <br/>\n&gt;shift.<br/>\n&gt;  Our ps routine for swing shift WAS:  Dad comes home from work after<br/>\n&gt;midnight, sleeps until 9 or 10, by which time children have gone off to<br/>\n&gt;school; dad would go to work just before children return from school and<br/>\n&gt;children were in bed before dad returned from work.  YUCK!  (Just one of <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;many reasons we homeschool!)  Now, we all shift schedules according to <br/>\n&gt;Dad&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;work schedule.  (although it is a little hard for the family to do the<br/>\n&gt;midnight to 7 a.m. routine, so we compromise as needed!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I also think it depends on the needs of the child.  We have health problems<br/>\n&gt;in our family which are exacerbated by disrupted sleep routines.  So, when<br/>\n&gt;someone is in a health flare, it becomes important that there be some <br/>\n&gt;routine<br/>\n&gt;to encourage good sleep patterns.  Also, I can&#39;t sleep knowing there are<br/>\n&gt;children up and about.  It&#39;s more a matter of wanting to be there/be <br/>\n&gt;involved<br/>\n&gt;with them than lack of trust.  Since I&#39;m most often the one with health<br/>\n&gt;problems, my sleep needs take precedent over kid&#39;s schedule.  OTOH if <br/>\n&gt;someone<br/>\n&gt;else has a bigger/stronger need, we adjust.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The family time is most important to us.  We don&#39;t really care when the<br/>\n&gt;family sleeps, but we have better quality of life and family time if we are<br/>\n&gt;all on a similar schedule.  Our friends and extended family have learned to<br/>\n&gt;not call at 8 a.m. and that they may catch us napping mid-afternoon, and <br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt;learned to turn the phone off until I&#39;m up in the morning!  They&#39;ve also<br/>\n&gt;learned that if they need to talk to someone at 2 a.m., the odds are really<br/>\n&gt;good that I&#39;m up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It is my opinion that, as the parent, I have the responsibility to monitor<br/>\n&gt;the health conditions of my children and insist on a bedtime that is best <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt;the individual and the family, as needed.  I would definitely not be<br/>\n&gt;comfortable having kids up until who knows when.  Having people up and <br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt;during sleep hours is not much of an issue because, regardless of which<br/>\n&gt;schedule we are currently on, we have a bedtime routine which includes<br/>\n&gt;reading, cuddling, family time and tucking in kidlet who is about to turn <br/>\n&gt;12,<br/>\n&gt;but not about to give up that routine(!).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If someone has a hard time going to sleep at the designated hour, we<br/>\n&gt;encourage reading or other quiet activity.  Especially when we are having <br/>\n&gt;to<br/>\n&gt;switch from one schedule to another.  (I would probably be a family bed<br/>\n&gt;spokesperson if everyone else&#39;s snoring didn&#39;t keep me awake.  But that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;almost a different topic.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;This has probably not been an answer that&#39;s helpful for you, except to <br/>\n&gt;point<br/>\n&gt;out that the needs of each family differ.  (What a long-winded way to say: <br/>\n&gt;Do<br/>\n&gt;what is best for you and your family.  &lt;bg&gt; )<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for limiting usage of computer/internet (or computer games).  Again, it<br/>\n&gt;depends.  I&#39;m protective of where on the net my children go, so we use <br/>\n&gt;AOL&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;filter and also ask children to let us know when they are on the internet.<br/>\n&gt;Plus, I hang out with them enough that it is not difficult for me to steer<br/>\n&gt;them a different direction if I don&#39;t like where they are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have found we sometimes need to limit the time on the computer or using<br/>\n&gt;video games due to general crabbiness.  IMO, too much time in front of any<br/>\n&gt;electronic media has the same effect as too much time in front of TV or<br/>\n&gt;stuffed behind a school desk...brain wave coma.  (Quickly recognizable by <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;loss of ability to hear mom&#39;s voice and the vacant stares when you actually<br/>\n&gt;get them to look your way!  LOL)  We don&#39;t have fast rules about how much <br/>\n&gt;is<br/>\n&gt;too much, but watch our children&#39;s behavior and let that be our guide.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;As for math, we still use Saxon.  I love math and have no trouble getting <br/>\n&gt;DS<br/>\n&gt;to be enthusiastic about the subject.  We love the scientific aspects of it<br/>\n&gt;and multiplying fractions is just the sort of topic our brain waves enjoy.<br/>\n&gt;(sometimes comes in handy for solving video or puzzle game problems, too.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When it&#39;s time for SAT&#39;s or college placement tests, they&#39;ll either learn <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;subject quickly in order to move on and meet their goal, or they&#39;ll take<br/>\n&gt;remedial classes/find a tutor to get what they need when they need it.  So,<br/>\n&gt;either method works.  We use a hybrid:  Use a textbook, but without <br/>\n&gt;strictly<br/>\n&gt;following the outline/schedule and look for opportunities to explore math<br/>\n&gt;concepts in daily living.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If it helps any, I have 2 child-units.  One is an adult now.  We unschooled<br/>\n&gt;pretty thoroughly from about age 15 on (read:  could NOT get the kid to do<br/>\n&gt;any &#39;school&#39; work and eventually gave up with the theory that saving our<br/>\n&gt;relationship with him was more important than cramming the &#39;necessary&#39; <br/>\n&gt;school<br/>\n&gt;work into his rebellious brain!)  The stinker went on to take his GED after <br/>\n&gt;5<br/>\n&gt;years of no formal school work, refused to study with a GED study guide or<br/>\n&gt;look at any text books in order to prepare for the test, passed the GED <br/>\n&gt;test<br/>\n&gt;with flying colors the first try, has taken college courses, started his <br/>\n&gt;own<br/>\n&gt;family and has since gone on to become an electrician apprenticeship.  I<br/>\n&gt;count that as success.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He learned what he needed when he was ready for it.  Waiting only helped <br/>\n&gt;him<br/>\n&gt;to be more ready for it.  I learned to relax the hard way!  We do things <br/>\n&gt;much<br/>\n&gt;differently for the younger son.  (That&#39;s the cool thing about 10 years<br/>\n&gt;between kids, there is lots of time to analyze parenting decisions and <br/>\n&gt;learn<br/>\n&gt;for the second son.)  Luckily for us, the older one is so stubborn.  &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;FWIW<br/>\n&gt;Eiraul<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">http://www.hotmail.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.msn.com\">http://profiles.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kim","from":"&quot;Kim&quot; &lt;sinclai@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"oAEWejVth7qssIDcjH4lPmCkHQiSzplHMTJVtAo7hdhLuWl3VvCKL1ZhE3iQVNDA3iZdaimGFuh0haedFfdhC3GlZCE","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 746","postDate":"967486246","msgId":12230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmUwMWMwMTExYiQ4ZjJmM2EwMCRhMjhkYjNkMUB1c2VyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk2NzQ1OTM1Mi4zMTExM0BlZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12232,"prevInTime":12229,"nextInTime":12231,"topicId":12230,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Linda, I am a new Unschooling Mom as well!

I don&#39;t know if my<br/>\napproach will work, but we&#39;ll see!  my 10 yo had to learn some math for her<br/>\nHarry Potter website, because she is making recipes from the book, and she<br/>\nis trying different recipes out.  And in order to do that, she has to use a<br/>\nlot of fractions, adding and subtracting fractions until she gets the recipe<br/>\nright!  I am trying to look for other opportunities for her to learn math<br/>\nwithout it looking like a lesson!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had a personal tug-of-war about what bedtime to instill.  My DH<br/>\nbelieves that our 14 yo can set her own bedtime and I reluctantly agreed. At<br/>\nfirst,  she went to bed at midnight, 2 am at the latest, but she would be<br/>\nvery tired the next day and she has been getting to bed earlier on her own<br/>\nnow!  We have given a little bit of leeway for our 10 yo, but she still has<br/>\na bedtime of 10:00, although we let her stay up later if she is doing<br/>\nsomething important to her.  I let them get up at whatever time they want,<br/>\nbut, they realize that if they get up too late, there is a lot that they<br/>\nmiss out on, sometimes a trip!  If I go somewhere and they are not up, they<br/>\ndo not get to go!  Of course when I tell them the night before I am going<br/>\nsomewhere, or we have a homeschooling group meeting, they do go to sleep<br/>\nearlier.  I have also taught them about our Circadian rhythms and how it can<br/>\nget irregular and make you feel lousy when it is messed up by going to bed<br/>\nat different times.  And in the summer, when it gets hot early, if they are<br/>\nnot up when it is cool, they miss out on gardening which they love!  I<br/>\nguess, this a lesson in responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust relax and we will all get through this together!<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  From: &quot;linda loux&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starshine_lal@...\">starshine_lal@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 745<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am new to this site.
