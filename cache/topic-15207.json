There<br/>\nwas just a thin wall between her crib and our bed.  We moved when dd #2<br/>\nwas 7 months old.  #2 slept with us from the beginning (in our waterbed<br/>\nto boot).  When we moved, my plan was that #2 would sleep on a small mat<br/>\non the floor next to our bed, to begin the transition out of our bed. <br/>\nHA!  #1 had no interest in sleeping by herself in the bedroom at the<br/>\nother end of the house, so plan B was for her to sleep on the mat.  We<br/>\nquickly ended up at plan C - all 4 of us in the (fortunately king size) <br/>\nwaterbed.  #1 was just short of 3 years then.  The hardest part for me is<br/>\nthat I would end up squished between dh on one side and the girls on the<br/>\nother, because we have on old waterbed and everyone ends up rolling<br/>\ntogether.  We all stayed in the bed for about a year, until we moved both<br/>\ngirls together into a double bed.  Dh or I lay down with them until they<br/>\nfall asleep.  Most nights they sleep through, but sometimes they come to<br/>\nwake us during the night.  The eldest, now 8, is more likely to wake then<br/>\nthe 5 yr old.  <br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\nGain weight...
