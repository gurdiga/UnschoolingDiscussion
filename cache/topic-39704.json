It<br/>\nsounds like an unschooling process :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they&#39;ll end up with is what-makes-mom-comfortable. It might be<br/>\nunschooling. Then again it might not be unschooling because it&#39;s a rare<br/>\nperson who hasn&#39;t been affected by society&#39;s ideas about how children need<br/>\nto learn and be raised. And therefore what-makes-mom-comfortable is quite<br/>\noften what quiets the fears instilled by society.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s goal is what-makes-mom-comfortable then trying things to see<br/>\nwhat works will work. But if their goal is unschooling and they don&#39;t find<br/>\nlearning from life naturally, comfortably obvious, then<br/>\nwhat-makes-mom-comfortable won&#39;t get them to unschooling. If they can dig<br/>\ndeep and analyze what&#39;s going on then they can learn to see for themselves<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re making decisions based on fear and when they&#39;re making<br/>\ndecisions based on reality. Then they&#39;ll be able decide for themselves when<br/>\nwhat-makes-mom-comfortable isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what the discussions are about: holding fears and myths up to the<br/>\nlight of day. If someone doesn&#39;t feel they need the discussions, they don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to participate.  But the discussions are *very* valuable to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I&#39;m not insensitive to how discussions can be irritating and seem<br/>\nlike just a bunch of noise. My state&#39;s homeschooling list split into 2<br/>\nbecause of heated legal discussions: one for legal issues and one for<br/>\nhomeschooling. I come away from the legal issues list with an attitude of<br/>\nWhat is the point?? and Who really cares?? But I also come away from the<br/>\nother list with, well, nothing.

It could also mean that these newbies may have to wait a bit<br/>\n&gt; longer to understand the diversity of &quot;humors&quot; on this list. The<br/>\n&gt; thing is that, I find that most unschooling discussion lists carry a<br/>\n&gt; similar tone --and that may have to do with the fact that most of the<br/>\n&gt; same people are in these lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let me get this straight, there are how many people on this list?

Let me come out of long term<br/>\nlurkville to suggest that from my point of view the &quot;passion&quot; in the tone of<br/>\nvoice is of great value to me. I can go all over the net and watch people<br/>\npatting themselves on the back and using LLLLOvely words to express exactly<br/>\nnothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when someone jumps into a new list or discussion area with a &quot;play nice<br/>\nyou&#39;re upsetting me message&quot; it sets off big warning bells for me. I know I<br/>\nwould never assume that what I thought about a brand new list was so valuable<br/>\nI&#39;d try to get other people, long term members of an existing list, to do what<br/>\nI wanted without trying to figure out what was really going on first. In<br/>\nshort, if someone does something like that I expect that they have some sort<br/>\nof an agenda. At the least they are pretty self-centered and rude. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; The bottom line is that, when people work up the courage to present<br/>\n&gt; these complaints, we all should listen. The you in my previous post<br/>\n&gt; was not a personal you but a collective you. Now, notice I did not<br/>\n&gt; say &quot;change&quot; or  &quot;you are wrong&quot; or &quot;that is not true&quot;. I am choosing<br/>\n&gt; my words very deliberately because (1) I am not talking to you/you<br/>\n&gt; but a whole community; (2) this is not about rights or wrongs; this<br/>\n&gt; is just about having more effective communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are all sorts of &quot;communication&quot;. And the examples you have given might<br/>\nseem calm, sane, and reasonable to you. We all experience things through the<br/>\nlens of our own experience and perceptions. In my own experience, when people<br/>\nstart crying &quot;play fair&quot; it has usually meant that the ones with power didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant anyone upsetting them by mentioning some essentially unfair advantage<br/>\nthey held and yet refused to acknowledge as part of the dynamic. It might have<br/>\nbeen a clique of girls as school who were taking turns picking on one of the<br/>\nmembers. It might have been someone who did something awful to their child but<br/>\nthought to mention it was beyond the pale: the whole it&#39;s not wrong to hit,<br/>\nit&#39;s wrong to flinch ideology. The point is, some people feel that saying what<br/>\nthey mean and meaning what they say is o.k. and that there isn&#39;t really some<br/>\nhigher standard of compassionate communication that the holy adhere too. The<br/>\nhonest among us admit that we all have some sort of agenda and that in<br/>\ncommunicating about things that we care deeply about on email lists we are<br/>\nalso attempting to gain the approval of our audience. So, to come onto a list<br/>\nand cry &quot;Play fair&quot; one would have to ask by what rules? Who profits?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Newbies have communicated and we all can choose to acknowledge the<br/>\n&gt; communication or dismiss it. The people that post most of the time on<br/>\n&gt; the list will have bearing on how the newbies regard the WHOLE<br/>\n&gt; community represented in the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. So, the people on this list with the most experience and the most<br/>\nvaluable things to say should change what they have to say so that the people<br/>\nwith the least amount of experience and, as far as we know, the least amount<br/>\nto say about the subject, should feel comfortable and in their element? I<br/>\ncertainly didn&#39;t feel that I had the right to butt in and tell people to<br/>\nbehave in a certain way when I joined this list. My own opinion is that<br/>\ntelling people what is rude and unpolite is one of the rudest things a person<br/>\ncan do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; HARMONY, as a practice in choosing our words, is not so much about<br/>\n&gt; who we are as individuals but what we want to be as a community.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is the point of this list to give off harmonic vibes to newcomers? I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how much there is to be learned in that. Might make a good support list<br/>\nfor feeling good. I have other places and lists where I go to get pats on the<br/>\nback and kudos from those who think much as I do. I love those places but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t always learn new things there. I think we learn the most when we go<br/>\nbeyond our usual boundaries and comfort zones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120423264,"authorName":"llindsey3@satx.rr.com","from":"&lt;llindsey3@...&gt;","profile":"lllindsey","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: scaring the newbies","postDate":"1028564575","msgId":39837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYmIwMWMyM2M5YyQ1YWJjNzRhMCQwMzAyYThjMEBTUVVJRFdFUkQ+","referencesHeader":"PDE0Zi4xMWU5MzdiMy4yYTdlOTYxYUBhb2wuY29tPiA8YTA1MTExYjAwYjk3MmVjODFmNTNjQFsxOTIuMTY4LjEuMTAxXT4="},"prevInTopic":39834,"nextInTopic":39844,"prevInTime":39836,"nextInTime":39838,"topicId":39704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thank you Liza..
