Any","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1512106042\">Writing tends to be the number one concern of most of the homeschooling community <br/>\nand as a result there are a bazillion bad writing programs on the market. Any writing <br/>\nprogram designed by an educator will be awful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkip those. Go straight for the books written by professional writers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about writing for yourself first. Start a blog for yourself and get one of those great <br/>\nbooks that gives you writing prompts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like _The Pocket Muse_ by, Monica Wood. Use her prompts. Discover the joy of <br/>\nwriting!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also love _Poemcrazy_ by Susan Goldsmith Wooldridge. Her first assignment is to make <br/>\nword tickets and stick them all over your house! You have to read the book to get it, but it <br/>\nwas so much fun every kid in my family got into it. We wrote the most amazing poetry as a <br/>\nresult. Truly awesome, can&#39;t believe my kid wrote this, kind of poetry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for grammar, try _Nitty Gritty Grammar_ and _More NItty Gritty Grammar_ by Edith <br/>\nFine and Judith Josephson. These are references that use synidcated cartoons to teach <br/>\ngrammar. So readable and easy to use. My oldest (at age 14) read the books straight <br/>\nthrough just because they were entertaining!<br/>\n<br/>\nI also give lots of tips about natural writing on my blog:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bravewriter.com/blog/bravewriterblog.html\">http://bravewriter.com/blog/bravewriterblog.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my Brave Writer website is filled with natural writing stuff for free!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bravewriter.com\">http://www.bravewriter.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a bit of a nut about this writing thing. We shouldn&#39;t be afraid to create a context that <br/>\nencourages and supports growth in writing. Otoh, we don&#39;t want to crush our kids&#39; <br/>\nattempts with a bunch of rules. So use your intuition to guide you and above all, enjoy <br/>\nwriting!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":102802,"nextTopicId":102834}}
