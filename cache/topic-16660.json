Can anyone tell me a bit more<br/>\nabout it?<br/>\nIt sounds like a good one for my boyfriend. He&#39;s right<br/>\nnow doing the working on the &quot;ground floor&quot; of the<br/>\ncompany thing...(his dad&#39;s company)...he programs the<br/>\ndatabase and helps produce the products for this<br/>\npublishing company that he has invested alot of time<br/>\nand energy into over awhile....and he basically cannot<br/>\nbe replaced right now very easily. The problem(s)? He<br/>\nis getting burned out, and has to work long hours<br/>\nright now while things are getting underway with this<br/>\nnew project...He doesn&#39;t get paid what they would have<br/>\nto pay someone else to do the job and put as much work<br/>\ninto it...you know how it is when you are helping out<br/>\nfamily... AND  he is an artist...really good with real<br/>\npeople caricitures...<br/>\nAND my sister/me, etc...(our family tends to move<br/>\ntogether, business wise)...used to travel around from<br/>\nfair to festival and back again, etc, etc...doing &quot;wax<br/>\nhands&quot; (sculptures out of people&#39;s hands in<br/>\nwax..holding roses dipped in wax...etc..)...until my<br/>\ndad had his stroke and we stayed in phx. for awhile...<br/>\nand after he died we moved back here...and we had a<br/>\nstore in the mall for a little while but it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nworking out so my sis is going on the road again, cuz<br/>\nshe can make good money at it, and well...it&#39;s fun. we<br/>\nlike it. Me and my son went with her when he was 2 and<br/>\nI was pregnant with dd and it was fabulous. I think<br/>\nit&#39;s great for the kids. Anyway, my boyfriend really<br/>\nwants to go on the road too now, doing caricitures or<br/>\nsomething....and hm...how to put it...he is such a<br/>\ncarefree laidback hippie person at heart, but right<br/>\nnow his job (where he works with mostly older business<br/>\nmen, and business-minded investors and advertisers)<br/>\nrequires him to be the opposite and deal with things<br/>\nas though he IS an older business-minded man, when he<br/>\nis only 26 and wants to travel and draw and unschool,<br/>\nbut worries alot about what other people think. (and<br/>\nhis family thinks the idea is crazy) He thinks about<br/>\neverything very logically by nature, which is good,<br/>\nespecially with me cuz sometimes I lack in that area,<br/>\nand am TOO spontaneous. His problem here comes in with<br/>\nlack of confidence that he can actually make a living<br/>\ndrawing and not having a &quot;real job&quot; and that be OKAY,<br/>\nwith letting go of the whole &quot;how much money per hour&quot;<br/>\nconcept, and ...well, just letting go and doing<br/>\nsomething that everyone else (especially people who<br/>\nhave never made a living this way) may think is crazy.<br/>\nI was talking to him this morning about going...(the<br/>\nfair season is about to start and my sister was<br/>\ntalking to him about going)... and he really wants to<br/>\nbut I was trying to explain that he won&#39;t enjoy it if<br/>\nhe is in this mentality. I even compared it (in my<br/>\nmind, to myself) to having to &quot;deschool&quot; him from the<br/>\nway of thinking that he has to be in right now for his<br/>\njob...and how it is the same cuz he will have to/is<br/>\nhaving to defend himself and this &quot;crazy, ridiculous&quot;<br/>\nidea of what to do right now to his family and<br/>\nfriends...his sister made a joke to me the other day<br/>\nthat he was going to run away with circus people...<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t want to &quot;burst his bubble, though, by<br/>\nsaying something&quot;. They are well-meaning, but you<br/>\nknow, it&#39;s an off the wall thought to people who have<br/>\neverything planned out before they do it...and there&#39;s<br/>\nnothing wrong with that, but it is just very much not<br/>\nme. whew. that was rambly. I missed this board. Thanks<br/>\nfor reading that whole thing. Any advice or ESPECIALLY<br/>\nbooks and what not like that that anyone can offer<br/>\nwould be greatly appreciated. If he sees that other<br/>\npeople somewhere sometime have done it (with a family)<br/>\nthen he would feel alot better....like finding this<br/>\nsite and board did for me and<br/>\nunschooling....strengthened my resolve, you might say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Bobbie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nGet email at your own domain with Yahoo!
