I have found that writing down just why we have chosen<br/>\nthis path is helpful during the rocky times.  And when I get anxious, my dh<br/>\nis often the one to tell me to relax, we&#39;re all doing a great job, the kids<br/>\nare great etc.  I think that John Anderson posted the quote from Rudyard<br/>\nKipling--one worth repeating, I think:<br/>\n &quot;The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed<br/>\nby the tribe. To be your own man is hard business. If you try it, you will<br/>\nbe lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay<br/>\nfor the privilege of owning yourself.&quot;<br/>\n  Debra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptjlmbaldwin@...\">ptjlmbaldwin@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 24, 2000 7:38 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] inner voice maintenance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ptjlmbaldwin@...\">ptjlmbaldwin@...</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks for the words about both journaling and meditating.<br/>\n&gt; I do keep a journal sporadically, and I try to get quiet<br/>\n&gt; and pray in the morning, but often worry crowds out these<br/>\n&gt; important activities.
