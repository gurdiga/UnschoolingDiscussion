With full awareness of the fire storm any labeling<br/>\ndiscussion can generate, I offer you the term, because it is<br/>\nhelpful in distinguishing between folks who are disability aware<br/>\nand those who are less attuned to that culture.  The only group<br/>\nof people with disabilities (PWD&#39;s) that actively rejects people<br/>\nfirst language is the Deaf community, which contends that they<br/>\nhave a culture, not a disability.  Some of the pity parties, like<br/>\nthe telethons, do not use people first language, but they don&#39;t<br/>\nreject it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 01, 2002 11:45 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2095<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| In a message dated 6/1/02 8:23:17 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/>\n| <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n|<br/>\n| &lt;&lt;<br/>\n|  However, I don&#39;t think anyone would disagree that there are<br/>\ntruly disabled<br/>\n|  people who exist.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n|<br/>\n| I disagree.<br/>\n| There are people with disabilities, some massive.
