It is very true.  In the <br/>\nfield you are  concerned with returning a soldier to the battle.  You need to <br/>\nhave a fighting force.  Also resupply only occurs at certain times.  Blood and <br/>\nother medical supplies are limited.  When there is a large amount of casualties <br/>\nthe more serious will sit in the back of the tent or will sit in a holding <br/>\narea waiting to be transferred back.  If transport doesn&#39;t come in time they may <br/>\nin fact die waiting for treatment.
