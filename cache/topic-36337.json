You make a bunch of observations.  You<br/>\ngeneralize them into a theory.  You make more observations to test the<br/>\ntheory.  If they fit, then you have a good theory.  This is impossible, has<br/>\nnever happened, and wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first problem is that **any finite set of observations can support an<br/>\ninfinite number of theories**.  So how do you generalize observations into<br/>\none theory when there are infinite choices?  You don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next problem is that no matter how many white socks I find, there may<br/>\nalways be a black one somewhere else.  It can&#39;t prove anything.  It can&#39;t<br/>\neven make something more likely.  There is no valid way to establish that<br/>\nsomething is even more likely based on numerous observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince induction can&#39;t happen and wouldn&#39;t work, you&#39;re probably wonder what<br/>\ndoes work.  This is called the Problem of Induction, it&#39;s the one Popper<br/>\nsolved.  Here is the process that knowledge is actually created by (notice<br/>\nthat its evolution):<br/>\nStep 1: Problem/Question<br/>\nStep 2: Conjectures/Theories/Explanations.  It does not matter how you come<br/>\nup with them, or who comes up with them.  The more the better.<br/>\nStep 3: Criticism.  Find flaws in theories and reject those.  Any theory<br/>\nwith any flaw at all is wrong (although a similar theory with one change<br/>\nmay still be right).  This is where observations come in, as one form of<br/>\ncriticism.  But logic and argument are also useful criticisms.<br/>\nStep 4: Alter your worldview to incorporate your new theory that survived<br/>\ncriticism in place of the old one.<br/>\nStep 5: New Problem<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key points are that it doesn&#39;t matter who comes up with an idea.  There<br/>\nis no authority involved, and claiming &quot;my theories are right b/c of<br/>\nexperience in the world&quot; is obvious specious.  Authority and Experience<br/>\nmaking someone right only makes any sense at all to inductionists.  What<br/>\nmakes people right is that all the rival theories fail to criticism, and<br/>\ntheir own theory does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote theories are basically explanations.  Also that accepted theories are<br/>\nnot &quot;proven&quot; or even established as &quot;likely&quot; but simply the best and only<br/>\ntheory that makes sense.
