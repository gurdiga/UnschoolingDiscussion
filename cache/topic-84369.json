I saw a game just like this at my local big box book store (Chapters up here in Canada). It looked wonderfull but it was $20 and I am waaaaay too cheap. So I read the rules on the back and made the game at home with a few stray die and some cards. I do the same thing with the Rainbow Resources catalogues and such. I scan for good ideas and steal them shamelessly. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122649447,"authorName":"sonyacurti","from":"&quot;sonyacurti&quot; &lt;jcurtielectric@...&gt;","profile":"sonyacurti","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"joyful math","postDate":"1068477395","msgId":84369,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJvb2E0aittOWdnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":84406,"prevInTime":84368,"nextInTime":84370,"topicId":84369,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"pam, I posted about the math power book and did see that it was out of print :( but I think it can be bought used from Amazon.com I love your page !!
