There are things that are so obviously NOT <br/>\nunschooling that it would be really confusing to let descriptions of them AS <br/>\nunschooling just sit there. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo get back to phonics -- what Ned posted about kids having to learn phonics <br/>\n&quot;sounded&quot; like not-unschooling to me and to others and we pointed that out. <br/>\nAs I said before, it seemed inconsistent and misleading - I meant relative to <br/>\nall the other great unschooling stuff that Luz and Ned have written.  To pass <br/>\nalong the idea that the only way kids can learn to read is by learning <br/>\nphonics is going to make people think that they are going to mess up their <br/>\nkids if they don&#39;t somehow &quot;do&quot; a phonics program. But, then what Ned posted <br/>\nin response to the &quot;Can you teach me to read?&quot; question was not at all about <br/>\nforcing a phonics program down a kid&#39;s throat - it was about gently providing <br/>\na bit of information about how sounds and letters work in response to a kid&#39;s <br/>\ndirect question and waiting to let the child take the lead on what he wants <br/>\nto do with that information. It was much more like what I&#39;d expect from the <br/>\nunschoolers that I know Ned and Luz to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - my complaint, Ned, if you&#39;re interested - is that you may be vastly <br/>\nunderestimating how very anxious people are about their young kids and <br/>\nreading and how they will &quot;hear&quot; you when you say that kids have to learn <br/>\nphonics to learn to read. I think they&#39;ll hear that as: &quot;Your kid will NOT <br/>\nlearn to read in a comfortable, relaxed, child-controlled/parent-facilitated, <br/>\nidiosyncratic way that can develop solely out of being observant, aware, and <br/>\nresponsive parents without any formal, systematic, preplanned, <br/>\nparent-directed program.&quot; I think it sounds to people like you are saying <br/>\nthat unschooling will not WORK with reading. Hence, all the responses about <br/>\nall the kids who DID learn to read in unschooling families - no phonics <br/>\nprogram or any OTHER kind of program, just supportive and responsive parents <br/>\npaying attention to their own kids and helping them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, &quot;phonics&quot; is not just &quot;learning to sound out words&quot; but is <br/>\nsynonymous, in most people&#39;s minds, with some kind of &quot;teach-a-kid-to-read&quot; <br/>\nprogram - maybe thanks to the ubiquitous &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot; and &quot;The Reading <br/>\nGame&quot; and &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; and &quot;Reading Reflex&quot; <br/>\nand so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents being responsive to their kid will notice when he/she <br/>\nseems interested in the sounds of letters and are likely to give them some <br/>\nhelp in their efforts. It doesn&#39;t ALWAYS come from the parents, of course. My <br/>\nmiddle child, at 3 years old, apparently spent about 3 weeks nagging her poor <br/>\nolder sister while they &quot;read&quot; in their beds at night, &quot;What does THIS say? <br/>\nP-O-P. What does THIS say? &quot;H-O-P&quot;&quot; and so on - until she&#39;d figured out the <br/>\nsounds of the letters all by herself and could, seemingly by magic, read. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t expect it, of course, and never saw it coming. A neighbor down the <br/>\nstreet told me that Roxana could read - I didn&#39;t even KNOW it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Ned - you might want to have a look at what you sent originally and <br/>\nsee why everyone reacted as if it was anti-unschooling advice. I&#39;m sure that, <br/>\nto you, what you answered in regard to the &quot;I want to learn to read&quot; question <br/>\nand what you wrote in that first post sounded the same - but they gave me a <br/>\nvery different sense of what you were suggesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.NHEN.org\">http://www.NHEN.org</a><br/>\nChanging the Way the World Sees Homeschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"damned proud of this&#39;n&#39;that","postDate":"1028514513","msgId":39778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3LjJiOTZhZjIwLjJhN2YzY2QxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39781,"prevInTime":39777,"nextInTime":39779,"topicId":39778,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/4/02 4:39:45 PM, DMM5692@aol.com writes:  You re free to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1666310539\">In a message dated 8/4/02 4:39:45 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DMM5692@...\">DMM5692@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; yes i have abandonment issues. <br/>\nyes im sensitive!
