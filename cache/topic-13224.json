I know it is only about 10,000 feet at the<br/>\nsummit but I&#39;m sure it is really 10 MILLION feet down &lt;g&gt;  For those that<br/>\nhave never been there, you come up and then it is like someone cut the top<br/>\noff and the road is instantly flat so you don&#39;t really see what might be in<br/>\nfront of you.  There was a gal parked right smack dab in the middle of the<br/>\nroad standing by her car.  We had three choices, hit her, the 10 million<br/>\nfeet down the cliff face or putting the truck into the snow bank on the up<br/>\nside cliff face.  My sister and I were in a panic because the last vehicle<br/>\nwe passed was a big rig pulling half a modular home.  All we could picture<br/>\nwas horses plastered all over the road.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, we got the fillies out and up the hill and tied to a couple of<br/>\ntrees. Then we went to deal with the one taco short of a combination plate!<br/>\nSeems she had never driven in the snow before and the black ice scared her.<br/>\nO.K., I can deal with that EXCEPT her husband was asleep in the back seat<br/>\nand she didn&#39;t want to wake him up because he really needed the sleep!<br/>\nDon&#39;t know who was more peeved at her, us or him.  When he asked her why she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t wake him up (not in those words &lt;g&gt;), she said &quot;But you look so sweet<br/>\nand peaceful.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGrrrr, did I mention one guy had already gone off the road?  We luckily had<br/>\na winch on the truck to pull him back up the hill!  Oh, and the truck with<br/>\nthe modular had pulled off so the driver could take 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: amy mathews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tlcamy@...\">tlcamy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 04, 2001 11:28 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; we are very far from parker but, also very familiar with it<br/>\n&gt; funny thing about the passes here, most Colorado drivers don&#39;t have any<br/>\nproblems but out of state vehicles are more sluggish, has to do with air<br/>\nmixture I think<br/>\n&gt; we have family in Iowa and are car runs much faster there<br/>\n&gt; I no what you mean about everyone being cousins or related<br/>\n&gt; ditto here<br/>\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Lynda<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, September 02, 2001 11:47 PM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] lynda<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Well, we are on the coast.
