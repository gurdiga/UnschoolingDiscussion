So I understand both sides <br/>\nand I think both types of people benefit their community.<br/>\nWithout the movers, you don&#39;t have the influx of new ideas/products etc.... <br/>\nin the same way.  Moving around gives you insight on an area you just can&#39;t <br/>\nget without being there.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad there is more opportunity today for people to do either one...stay <br/>\nput or move a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41915,"nextTopicId":41946}}
