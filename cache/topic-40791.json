We live in a literate society, full of all kinds of <br/>\ninteresting, stimulating things.  Some things will keep people from <br/>\nfully enjoying the world around them--greed, violence, lack of love.  <br/>\nThose things that keep people from enjoying life are the things that <br/>\nneed to change. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some kids who wouldn&#39;t have the advantages that other kids <br/>\nhave, but the problem isn&#39;t lack of &quot;being educated&quot;.  It&#39;s just a <br/>\nlack of good parenting.  If kids have good, involved parents, they <br/>\nwill learn.  That&#39;s one of the basic principles of unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne interesting thing I remember from one of Gatto&#39;s books was that <br/>\never since compulsory schooling started, literacy rates dropped. He&#39;s <br/>\ngoing by records of men entering the army during America&#39;s various <br/>\nwars.  Before compulsory schooling, something like 95% of the men <br/>\nwere literate.  It steadily dropped with every year of compulsory <br/>\neducation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo if we want to encourage literacy and an educated citizenry, we <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do what doesn&#39;t work (school).  We want to find a way <br/>\nto encourage parents to be good parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 2230  All those kids","postDate":"1029208654","msgId":40852,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqOXRvZSs5cW81QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEI5N0Q2NUIzLjEyRTYlbmVkdmFyZUBudHBseC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":40803,"nextInTopic":40861,"prevInTime":40851,"nextInTime":40853,"topicId":40791,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This list<br/>\nseems to say that unschooling is better than what the state offers. Why<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t the state provide UNschooling? )<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s those taxes that say, &quot;your property is not yours. It&#39;s ours, and we&#39;ll<br/>\nuse it as we decide, not you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state can&#39;t give (provide) anything to anyone until it has first taken<br/>\nfrom everyone else. The libertarian &quot;philosophy&quot; is one of personal<br/>\nresponsibility and individual choice in all matters, including how to raise<br/>\nand educate our children.<br/>\nTherefore, briefly, no government, like no person, has a right to take by<br/>\nforce what belongs to another -- no matter what. If there is a true need,<br/>\nmost people will contribute and help, but no one should be forced to give to<br/>\nanother at the point of a gun, as the government does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe state is not a good educator. It doesn&#39;t belong in the education<br/>\nbusiness. It spends about $1B per day of our money for its bad schools,<br/>\npreventing the earners of that money from using it for good education for<br/>\ntheir own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a myth that&#39;s useful to the schoolers that &quot;all those kids&quot; would not<br/>\nbe provided for at all if the government didn&#39;t give them &quot;some sort of an<br/>\neducation.&quot; One problem is that they are being denied education NOW, and<br/>\nwould get better education if they were given a choice.

Those who believe that parents would not educate their kids or<br/>\nfind decent schools for them, are believing a state schoolers&#39; (usually<br/>\nracist) lie.
