I thought I was doing the<br/>\nresponsible parent thing by telling him I wanted him to wait until he could<br/>\ntake care of it... I thought that would be about age 8. Over several years<br/>\nhe never gave up on the idea of getting a parakeet, and he spent his money<br/>\non bird toys and a cage. When he was 7 we bought a book about parakeets and<br/>\nI sat down to discuss with him the daily chores involved in caring for a<br/>\nbird. Well, the chapter on cleaning the cage did him in. He decided he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want a bird after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, I regret not getting the bird when he was 3 and eager. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave minded helping to take care of it and I know he would have done most of<br/>\nthe work. OTOH, it was good for him to weigh the responsibilities and decide<br/>\nhe didn&#39;t want to take them on. He, however, has no regrets with this ending<br/>\nand still does not want a bird. A while ago, we even went to visit a friend<br/>\nof a friend who breeds parakeets (and we talked about why buying an animal<br/>\nfrom a petstore is not a good idea.) He enjoyed looking at the birds but<br/>\nstill didn&#39;t want to bring one home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have animals in the house... 3 dogs and 2 cats...   but they&#39;re my<br/>\nresponsibility because I the one who brought them all home. ;-)<br/>\n-- <br/>\nThea<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:metta@...\">metta@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"NumoAstro@aol.com","from":"NumoAstro@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"U9NPULc5JVmve0Xzf2JwiGS7AiFOv28fonoBTWfK_nO88WbsvLjRz_5ZzqnkIRfX39v3Me9G9d8","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Keeping Animals","postDate":"963840773","msgId":11212,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDguN2Q4OWJhMi4yNmE0NjUwNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11250,"prevInTime":11211,"nextInTime":11213,"topicId":11212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can only assume that letting my child have an animal is part of this unschooling thing.
