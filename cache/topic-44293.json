Can&#39;t wait to see what she has to say after she sees my ds playing the PS2 and that we stopped violin and cello lessons, and he hasn&#39;t read a book in a month!! Horrors!  I am just now learning to accept these things, can you tell? <br/>\nI am also still keeping the instruments around but I could tell they weren&#39;t that passionate about the lessons anymore,  everyone is &quot;ohhh, and they were so good!&quot;..  They seem so sad!(The other people)<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have to believe that if that is their passion they will come back to it.  Growing up, I also played piano and violin through grade school and high school.  Then I quit when I went to college,  I do think back now and wish I would have continued, but then would I have developed into the person I am now?  I think all those things are really important and now I enjoy playing.  If I want, I can always pick them up again or learn another!
