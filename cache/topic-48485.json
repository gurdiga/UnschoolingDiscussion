I was the &quot;bad&quot; kid - I smoked pot in my<br/>\nbedroom, snuck out at night, swore at my foster mom. My foster brother<br/>\nwas a year and a half younger, small for his age, shy, wanting to please.<br/>\nHe had no friends, but he was a nice kid, and we got along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen twenty dollars went missing from my foster mom&#39;s purse, she accused<br/>\nme, and even though I didn&#39;t take it, she was never convinced.When my<br/>\nfoster brother and my friend and I were in his room once with the door<br/>\nshut, talking about school and stuff, she burst in and told me I could<br/>\nnever be with him with the door shut. I never hurt him. I never stole<br/>\nfrom her. I liketo think that maybe hanging out with outspoken me was<br/>\npart of the reason he finally decided to tell the foster mom that the old<br/>\nguy living next door had been molesting him for over a year. Afterwards,<br/>\nI told him I&#39;d kick the guy&#39;s butt if he tried anything again, and showed<br/>\nhim my knife.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this - I guess I wish you&#39;d been my<br/>\nfoster mom, and I want to thank you for trying, and assure you that it<br/>\nmatters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that said, you do need to take care of yourself, and to take<br/>\ncare of Colton and Kayla. It is easy to let a kid like Jimmie suck up all<br/>\nyour energy and leave you dry, because he clearly needs so much. You just<br/>\ncan&#39;t be the only one giving to him, and part of modeling how to be<br/>\nhealthy includes modeling how to take care of your own needs. Sometimes,<br/>\nI think parents need to make a choice that isn&#39;t the best thing for their<br/>\nchild, because it is necessary for their own mental health. Do you gte<br/>\nout once a week or more and just do something for you - take a ceramics<br/>\nclass, join a choir, sit in the woods and read? You need that, and Jimmie<br/>\nneeds you to have that so you&#39;ll be able to be there for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there services available through the agency he was placed through?<br/>\nThings like counseling, respite, maybe a Big Brother or something similar<br/>\nfor him?

That was never told until we were all grown.  My parents <br/>\nbroke up when I was 17.  My older cousin was 18, and took a live-in <br/>\nbabysitting job.  The younger ones were 15 (my mean, violent cousin) and 14 <br/>\n(my sister, who denies being messed up by that breakup, but I could tell you <br/>\nstories for two hours).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own childhood was crowded badly by my parents&#39; need to help my mother&#39;s <br/>\nsister&#39;s children.  That might be another reason I liked school.  At school <br/>\nit was just me, not me and my cousin (except in band, and sometimes <br/>\nsocially). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason my aunt couldn&#39;t raise her own girls (she had three older boys, <br/>\none of whom ended up shot dead, the next in various misdemeanor problems and <br/>\nthe middle of the five moved far away and stayed clean) was alcoholism.  When <br/>\nwe took her daughters I was seven.  Within that next ten years my mother <br/>\nsuccumbed to alcoholism herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are genetic factors that can&#39;t always be overcome.  Even without the <br/>\nabuse and neglect, he is genetically a part of people who will abuse and <br/>\nneglect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of wonderful adoption stories in the world, and some <br/>\nnightmares.  I know some of both personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere must be some really terrible factors for you to need school to help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be afraid for a little girl being so close in with a child with such <br/>\nproblems.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was molested (with the fingers of two little boys) when she was one <br/>\nyear old.  It led to the breakup of a group I had really loved, because one <br/>\nof the moms had a boy who was being sexual to other children and she saw no <br/>\nproblem with it at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister was molested and was afraid to tell my parents, because she was <br/>\n(rightly so) physically afraid of my younger cousin (who was a year older <br/>\nthan she was).  That cousin hit me once, when we were ten and twelve of so, <br/>\nuntil she was tired of hitting.  I just curled up and took it, protecting my <br/>\nface and stomach, because she was strong, furious, and had little to no <br/>\nconscience.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad I told, she would have gotten a spanking, and then later something of <br/>\nmine would have disappeared or been destroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this isn&#39;t the type of response you&#39;re hoping for.  I hope others <br/>\nhave good ideas to help you keep doing what you&#39;re doing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart goes out to children who have been abused and neglected.  When my <br/>\nmother left my dad, she got pregnant within two years.  That boy was <br/>\nneglected and abused bigtime, and he has never been a useful adult.  Both his <br/>\nparents were alcoholics, my mother was drunk when she went into labor.  They <br/>\nmarried after he was born, and that lasted three years.  Altogether a horror <br/>\nstory.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took him in then, and again when he was thirteen.  Being his sister didn&#39;t <br/>\nsave me from the lying and drug use and stealing from us.  I talked my mom <br/>\ninto going to AA so she could be given custody again.  He&#39;s never held a job <br/>\nlonger than a month and a half, and he&#39;s 30 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan your marriage survive through this to the point where all three children <br/>\nare up and out?<br/>\nIf it can&#39;t what will become of each of them?

I would certainly never put her in <br/>\ndanger, or my other son.  And I may not have made this clear, but Jimmie is <br/>\nalready adopted.  He&#39;s a done deal; I just need to come to some sort of peace <br/>\nabout this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to respond to the post, but after reading this particular section, I felt that maybe I did have<br/>\nsomething to offer.  I was abused by several adults while I was a child and although I will not get into<br/>\nthe specifics, I do want to tell you what it did to me.  The biggest thing that happened was that I stopped<br/>\ntrusting adults, period.  Even when I moved away from the situation and into a safe one, I did not trust<br/>\nthese adults either.  Once you are burned by authority figures, that&#39;s it (or it was for me).  He will have<br/>\nan extremely difficult time trusting adults for the rest of his life no matter what you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might sound like there is no hope, but that isn&#39;t true.  You are his hope and your job at this point<br/>\nis to give love and acceptance.  When a child is abused, they grow up really quickly and if put in the<br/>\nsituation, can take care of themselves if they need to.  He can take care of himself physically, but you<br/>\nare there to help him with his spirit.  He will find it when the time is right, but it will only be because he<br/>\ndid have someone there to offer him the unconditional love he deserves.  Love him, bless him, and care<br/>\nfor him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn every situation, always ask....what would love do now?  And act on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.  If you need to take some time for you, then take it.  You are no good<br/>\nto him or the rest of the family if you let yourself get to this point.  The above question should be asked<br/>\nwhen it comes to you to.  What would love do now?  If you haven&#39;t read it yet, this book might be of some<br/>\nhelp to you..........Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch (it&#39;s not religious).

He was adopted at birth in an open, private <br/>\n  adoption, and I unschool him.  Jimmie is 11.  He&#39;s been with us for two <br/>\n  years, first as a foster son and then we adopted him a year and a half ago.  <br/>\n  He is in public school, which is a whole other post.  Suffice to say, I had <br/>\n  him at home for a year and then we had to make the difficult and painful <br/>\n  decision to put him in public school.  Kayla is 2 1/2, still foster at this <br/>\n  point, but we will be adopting her next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n     My question concerns Jimmie.  It was exactly 2 years ago today that he <br/>\n  came to live with us.  A victim of early neglect and abuse, he went through a <br/>\n  staggering eleven foster placements before coming to us.  His emotional <br/>\n  baggage was and still is heavy.  My question is not so much about Jimmie <br/>\n  himself, because I think we will always be dealing with the same problems on <br/>\n  some level.  My question is a selfish one, and it is for me.  I am exhausted <br/>\n  from parenting this child.  I am discouraged.  I have been emotionally and <br/>\n  physically battered by him.  I have been lied to and manipulated on a regular <br/>\n  basis.  I have cleaned up after his physical attacks on our home when he is <br/>\n  feeling angry.  All that said, I am still as committed to him as ever.  But <br/>\n  can someone tell me how I can keep going when my spirit is broken?  Just <br/>\n  getting out of bed and facing the challenges of the day is monumental for me. <br/>\n  I know it is not my place to change Jimmie, and I respect his wounded soul.  <br/>\n  But how do I keep doing this?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Warmly,<br/>\n  Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

For one, I hope there is counseling <br/>\nfor your son and the family as a whole. It doesn&#39;t just affect you, but the <br/>\nother children as well. Even if you don&#39;t see it right now. Even if the <br/>\nconflict is only between you and your son. It still trickles down onto the <br/>\nother children. So I think counseling is a must. Second, I&#39;m thinking here <br/>\nthat you are making sure that the children are safe from his anger as well. <br/>\nYou mentioned he takes it out on your house. I&#39;m also thinking you mean <br/>\nthrowing stuff or destroying household things and not throwing at someone or <br/>\nwrecking the other kids stuff. Still bad enough to live with, still damaging <br/>\nemotionally, just not physically. Yes?<br/>\nThirdly, I hear you say you want to go on. That you are committed, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s most of it right there. You aren&#39;t throwing in the towel even though <br/>\nyou are stressed and tired. Some parents do just give up and maybe that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat your son is expecting. Seems like everyone else did on him, right? <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s just trying to help the situation and hurry it along. So he can&#39;t <br/>\nget too comfortable and loved before you send him on his way.<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any quick easy answers, but look at it this way. You could be <br/>\nthe one and only person to ever make a difference in this boys life. You <br/>\nseem to really want to make that difference. I think that says a lot right <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSurf the Web without missing calls!

When there is that kind of stress (again, can only go on what <br/>\nyou told us) I, personally, don&#39;t see it as fair to adopt a third child <br/>\ninto that situation when you&#39;re broken yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can give some specifics of a problem situation in your <br/>\nhouse -- what you did, what Jimmie did, how you reacted to each <br/>\nother.

I have a small window of <br/>\nopportunity now, so here goes.  I am Carol and I have been married to Bud for <br/>\n24 years.  Our son Colton is 12.  He was adopted at birth in an open, private <br/>\nadoption, and I unschool him.  Jimmie is 11.  He&#39;s been with us for two <br/>\nyears, first as a foster son and then we adopted him a year and a half ago.  <br/>\nHe is in public school, which is a whole other post.  Suffice to say, I had <br/>\nhim at home for a year and then we had to make the difficult and painful <br/>\ndecision to put him in public school.  Kayla is 2 1/2, still foster at this <br/>\npoint, but we will be adopting her next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n   My question concerns Jimmie.  It was exactly 2 years ago today that he <br/>\ncame to live with us.  A victim of early neglect and abuse, he went through a <br/>\nstaggering eleven foster placements before coming to us.  His emotional <br/>\nbaggage was and still is heavy.  My question is not so much about Jimmie <br/>\nhimself, because I think we will always be dealing with the same problems on <br/>\nsome level.  My question is a selfish one, and it is for me.  I am exhausted <br/>\nfrom parenting this child.  I am discouraged.  I have been emotionally and <br/>\nphysically battered by him.
