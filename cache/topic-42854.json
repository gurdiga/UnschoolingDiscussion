How<br/>\npowerful is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as some input from personal experience, Nintendo tends to lean towards<br/>\ngames for the non-Mature audience. That does&#39;t mean childish. It means games<br/>\nwithout graphic violence and sexuality. They do have a fair number of titles<br/>\nfor mature players (like Resident Evil) now that the GameCube came out but<br/>\ntheir foundation is the Pokemon/Mario/Zelda/Donkey Kong/Sonic type games.<br/>\n(And those are exclusive to the Nintendo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Playstation has a &quot;stable&quot; of characters too (Spyro, Digimon are the<br/>\nones my daughter came up with) but they aren&#39;t as overwhelmingly popular.<br/>\nBut they do have some very popular games like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy<br/>\nthat aren&#39;t availble on Nintendo but, those are Teen titles.) She said the<br/>\none advantage of the Playstation 2 is that it plays the Playstation 1 games<br/>\ntoo. The Nintendo consoles never play the previous console version games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for handhelds, my daughter doesn&#39;t see a huge difference between the<br/>\nGameBoy Color and the GameBoy Advance (GBA) but says most new games will<br/>\nonly be for the GBA and the GBA does play all the games made for the older<br/>\nhandhelds too. She knows the GBA can hook up to the GameCube (with a cable)<br/>\nbut she&#39;s not sure if the GameBoy Color will hook up.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Nintendo/electronic games, again","postDate":"1031211071","msgId":42907,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwOTA1MDczMTExLjQ2MTE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2LjI2OGZiNDI5LjJhYTc0ZGFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42901,"nextInTopic":42909,"prevInTime":42906,"nextInTime":42908,"topicId":42854,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry everyone, but I have to bring up games again.
