My kids are<br/>\npretty good about eating in general but I do find sometimes they need a<br/>\nlittle food lift. The big one is them being tired. For all three of the<br/>\nlittle ones. Well actually for Tara too!!! I usually talk to them about how<br/>\nthey are feeling and then relate it to them not getting enough sleep or just<br/>\nhaving an active day. Lately Joseph and Sierra have been going in the pool<br/>\ntwice a day now. They dont realize how much that wears them out. Especially<br/>\nthe way they play out there and in the sun. Sometimes just sitting down and<br/>\nhaving some quiet time helps them get over that hump. I&#39;ll suggest we all do<br/>\na puzzle or I&#39;ll read some books to them. If one is more frustrated than the<br/>\nother, I may suggest some playtime on the computer or maybe a movie or<br/>\nsomething where I can get the 3 of them away from each other to settle down<br/>\nsome. With my kids, sometimes I think it too is a lot of stimulation with<br/>\nall 3 together so much. Luckily I have the room here to give them some<br/>\ndistance, but I usually have to initiate that as they don&#39;t see that as a<br/>\nproblem and will all stay together and fight. I kind of corral one up and<br/>\nsuggest something in a different part of the house. Sometimes I even try to<br/>\nnavigate one to my moms apartment. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s getting better now but at times it seems worse. I work on it a lot so<br/>\nthat we don&#39;t have major melt downs. It still happens. Today Joseph went<br/>\ncrying in his room because of the way Sierra plays with him. (or doesn&#39;t<br/>\nplay) He very rarely cries. Poor kids was upset. He was also tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if you can give us more detail we can think of things that may have<br/>\nworked for us.

All my kids, when they were little were rather shy. Even Tara was<br/>\nand well now you would never know it. People kept telling me school was the<br/>\nbest thing for her. Poor kid clung to her teacher for like 5 years. I think<br/>\nit made it worse for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Joseph was like that, since people knew he wasn&#39;t going to go to<br/>\nschool, they suggested all kinds of things like preschools and playgroups<br/>\nand kinder care classes. Things all very organized and told me not to worry<br/>\nif he didn&#39;t want to go. It would be good for him is what I heard. Never<br/>\nlistened to any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Joseph and Sierra to the YuGiOh tournament on Sat. Sierra pretty much<br/>\nhangs on to me and just watches. This was only the second time I have gone<br/>\nwith Joseph. Joe usually takes him. Well we were there for a few minutes and<br/>\nJoseph told me he was going to find someone to play with. We were too late<br/>\nfor the tournament. Well no sooner he says that he&#39;s off. He went and found<br/>\nsome kids to duel. After that was over, he ended up in another room with<br/>\nkids that were like 13-15. He walked right up to them and asked if they<br/>\nwanted to trade some cards. The first kid declined so he went to the next<br/>\nkid. He ended up trading and getting some cards he really wanted. Like an<br/>\nold pro. I was really awe struck to see him this way. Very confident and<br/>\ncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe and I were just talking about this tonight. How we see Sierra just<br/>\nstarting to talk to people she doesn&#39;t know. How much she&#39;s changed with her<br/>\npeople skills. And then noticing how Alyssa will be yacking away until<br/>\nsomeone talks to her that she doesn&#39;t know and she just shuts right up and<br/>\nstares at them. Joe said he&#39;s not worried about them at all.

Let them know that you understand they are<br/>\nunhappy.   Convey to them that you wish you could do something to make them<br/>\nfeel<br/>\nbetter.. ask them what you can do to help them feel better.   Even if they<br/>\nare unhappy, at least they know it is not something that you are doing<br/>\nintentionally &quot;to&quot; them, it&#39;s just a circumstance that you (and they)have to<br/>\ndeal with. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that is very important. I do it every time I need to. Even with<br/>\nAlyssa, and sometimes she&#39;s just so upset she&#39;s not hearing me. But I still<br/>\ntake the time to let her know, even briefly, that I hear what she&#39;s saying.<br/>\nI too also find other ways so that my kids can be happy. Yes it&#39;s<br/>\ninconvenient sometimes for me but so what? I seem to be hearing from others<br/>\n(not here) that the kids just need to deal with it and the whole *I&#39;m the<br/>\nmom I say so I don&#39;t care how you feel we have to do this* attitude!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we all went to the water park for the first time this summer, I thought<br/>\nwe would all have a blast. Well Alyssa just had about 30 minutes of it and<br/>\nshe was done for the day. She just doesn&#39;t like it right now there. So I<br/>\nbusted my butt to come up with an idea so the other kids could stay as they<br/>\nwere having a blast, and so Alyssa could leave and not have to stay. I<br/>\nfinally got a hold of my mom who came and picked her up. Now when we go, she<br/>\nhappily stays home with no fuss. I figure we can try again next year when<br/>\nshe&#39;s older if she wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that acknowledging those feelings the kids have make it so that<br/>\nwhen they do *need* to accompany us, there is no big deal. They know we go<br/>\nout of our way for them and they grow up willing to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":64419796,"authorName":"Nichole","from":"&quot;Nichole&quot; &lt;ms_fausey@...&gt;","profile":"ms_fausey","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] happiness of kids","postDate":"1057118416","msgId":75922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWMzNDA0ZSQ3NDFkZTk5MCQyNjAyYThjMEBGYXVzZXlEb2VzSVQ+","referencesHeader":"PGEuMzJhZDVmMjkuMmMzMzY2YjFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75921,"nextInTopic":75924,"prevInTime":75921,"nextInTime":75923,"topicId":75888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think it is because I have 4 <br/>\nchildren who are all very different.  They have different needs, wants, <br/>\ninterests, preferences.  I strive to compromise as much as I  can to make sure no <br/>\none is UNhappy, although, they may not all be as happy as they would like.  I do <br/>\ncare about thier happiness, and it&#39;s difficult when I can&#39;t please everyone, <br/>\nbut, I know sometimes it it just not a possiblity.   Take going out to eat for <br/>\ninstance, if all 6 of us go, it&#39;s a pretty sure bet that somebody is not <br/>\ngoing to just love the restaurant we end up going to.   But, we never go somewhere <br/>\nthat someone hates.   We have to compromise, take turns, make adjustments.  <br/>\nWe don&#39;t go to the same restaurant every time, so we all get a chance to eat at <br/>\nour favorite places.   Lots of times, we all agree except one person, and <br/>\nwhen it comes down to that, it&#39;s got to be a majority rule.  ( and again, never <br/>\nto somewhere someone hates, or even dislikes strongly)   I have even went <br/>\nthrough a drive thru for someone to get thier food to take in with us to the <br/>\n&quot;majority choice&quot; restaurant.    <br/>\n<br/>\n   I try to always offer alternatives, or give incentives. ( like the video <br/>\nrental scenario) if there is something I NEED/HAVE to do and a child does not <br/>\nwant to go.    If it is feasible for them to stay at home or stay with someone <br/>\nelse, then that is thier option.   Of course, that option is much easier now <br/>\nthat most of them are old enough to stay home alone<br/>\n<br/>\n.  I think one of the most important things we can do when a child is unhappy <br/>\nis to validate thier feelings.  Let them know that you understand they are <br/>\nunhappy.   Convey to them that you wish you could do something to make them feel <br/>\nbetter.. ask them what you can do to help them feel better.   Even if they <br/>\nare unhappy, at least they know it is not something that you are doing <br/>\nintentionally &quot;to&quot; them, it&#39;s just a circumstance that you (and they)have to deal with. <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-Discussion] happiness of kids","postDate":"1057104202","msgId":75909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkMS5jZThmY2YzLjJjMzM3YjRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75908,"nextInTopic":75911,"prevInTime":75908,"nextInTime":75910,"topicId":75888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/1/03 5:35:59 PM, mummy124@bellsouth.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-933395706\">In a message dated 7/1/03 5:35:59 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Then I asked if that&#39;s why we (a general we) unschooled?

Someone made the comment that &quot;they really don&#39;t care if their kids<br/>\nare happy or not.&quot; It was in reference to certain situations where the<br/>\nparents insist the children do something they don&#39;t want to do. The example<br/>\ngiven was a child having to run an errand with the mom because he can&#39;t stay<br/>\nhome alone. Now this has come up with me also, and although the children do<br/>\nindeed have other things they would rather do, they come along and I really<br/>\nhaven&#39;t had a problem with them complaining about it. Maybe because I do try<br/>\nto not have them be &quot;made&quot; to do things often they don&#39;t like. But if they<br/>\nwere mad about it or upset, even though they would still hve to go along, I<br/>\ncertainly would care they were mad or upset. This particular person stated<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t care and I heard from someone else who also said they don&#39;t care<br/>\neither. I was waiting for some kind of explanation or &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it that<br/>\nway&quot; and instead got what they said IS what they meant. I was really upset<br/>\nabout that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I asked if that&#39;s why we (a general we) unschooled? So that our kids<br/>\nwere happy. I was told that if that&#39;s why I unschooled, I was missing the<br/>\nboat. I made sure to note it&#39;s not the only reason why I do unschool.
