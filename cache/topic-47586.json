We have two male rats who really need a new home -<br/>\nwe<br/>\ngot a female as a companion for our first rat and she turned out to be<br/>\nabout 3 days pregnant. We put her daughter in our lovely 3 level cage<br/>\nwith her mom and Mary (rat #1) but the two boys are sharing a cage that&#39;s<br/>\nreally too small for them, and 5 rats is really too much for us. We<br/>\nthought they had a new home when they were younger but the person sort of<br/>\nflaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are very nice...one is a hooded rat named Robin Hood, and the other<br/>\nhas buff-colored fur with a barely visible white mark on his forehead and<br/>\nred eyes. His name is Tortoise, because he&#39;s always been slower and less<br/>\ndaring than his brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nNana, BTW, loves watching the rats. She was jumping on the coffee table<br/>\nduring the night and then putting her paws up on the cage, but we were<br/>\nworried that the whole thing would fall over so we put the keyboard on<br/>\nthe coffee table last night and left it on (on the Dog Pianist setting,<br/>\nof course) and in the middle of the night we heard music and then running<br/>\nfeet... so I think it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar, north of Sacramento...&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Dar<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are all the way in Lake Oswego, OR, about 15 min south of Portland.  I<br/>\nwish we were close enough, we would probably take in every rat in need of<br/>\na home if it was in our power.  We are limited in space too and part of<br/>\nthe deal in getting the rats to breed is that we have enough large cages<br/>\nfor all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just scored a very nice ferret cage from PetSmart, it was marked half<br/>\noff because of some minor dents and it even included a hammock!  Now we<br/>\nneed to buy or build one about the same size for our intended boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAverage rat litters are about 12 so we have to line up enough homes for<br/>\nmost of them, we will be keeping 4 ourselves.  Lanora is very committed<br/>\nto this endeavor and has been researching rat care, homemade cages and<br/>\nbreeding.  She has even begun a recycling business to generate money for<br/>\nvet costs.

We have two male rats who really need a new home - we<br/>\ngot a female as a companion for our first rat and she turned out to be<br/>\nabout 3 days pregnant. We put her daughter in our lovely 3 level cage<br/>\nwith her mom and Mary (rat #1) but the two boys are sharing a cage that&#39;s<br/>\nreally too small for them, and 5 rats is really too much for us. We<br/>\nthought they had a new home when they were younger but the person sort of<br/>\nflaked.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are very nice...one is a hooded rat named Robin Hood, and the other<br/>\nhas buff-colored fur with a barely visible white mark on his forehead and<br/>\nred eyes. His name is Tortoise, because he&#39;s always been slower and less<br/>\ndaring than his brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nNana, BTW, loves watching the rats. She was jumping on the coffee table<br/>\nduring the night and then putting her paws up on the cage, but we were<br/>\nworried that the whole thing would fall over so we put the keyboard on<br/>\nthe coffee table last night and left it on (on the Dog Pianist setting,<br/>\nof course) and in the middle of the night we heard music and then running<br/>\nfeet... so I think it worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar, north of Sacramento...</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":60467660,"authorName":"louisam1@juno.com","from":"louisam1@...","profile":"louisam1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Rats, Julie&#39;s newborn","postDate":"1035402759","msgId":47586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDIzLjE0NTc0MS4tNDcwMjczLjEzLmxvdWlzYW0xQGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47620,"prevInTime":47585,"nextInTime":47587,"topicId":47586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"\n\nJulie, how did you come by the newborn rat?
