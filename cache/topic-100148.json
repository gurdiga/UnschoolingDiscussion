After the movie, my dd now has an electric guitar.  &lt;g&gt;***<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Mia (5) has asked for an electric guitar and Jacob (8) asked if I<br/>\ncould buy him an old set of drums for his birthday (not till July &lt;g&gt;). It<br/>\nwill have to go on the list of things to get along with a video camera. Jess<br/>\n(10) wants to make a movie. Maybe they could make a music video.<br/>\n<br/>\nMia has made a mini stage in the form of an old chest which she stands on to<br/>\nsing. Mostly Eminem. I can see her asking for ACDC soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago we would have boycotted the movie on the basis of the low<br/>\nlevel coarse language warning. What a shame that would have been. Jess has<br/>\nbeen trying out ass the last couple of weeks. He said it to Mark yesterday,<br/>\nwho didn&#39;t lose his cool but patiently explained that we are Australian so<br/>\nit&#39;s arse young man, arse.
