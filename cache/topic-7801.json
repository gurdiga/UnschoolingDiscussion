Jackie, I usually let my daughters answer the questions about their <br/>\nschooling when we&#39;re out.  They usually don&#39;t permit me a word in edgewise, <br/>\nanyhow.    When I&#39;m asked directly, I usually say that our family is educated <br/>\nat home.  I like the co-creator verbage, though.
