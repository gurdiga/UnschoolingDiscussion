Chloe (4 3/4 ;0) has seen the advertisements for <br/>\nthe upcoming Family Fear Factor on channel 4, whatever station that <br/>\nis. She swears we could do well. She says that Daddy would be <br/>\nterrible on the &quot;bug eating part&quot;...she is right! But she thinks we <br/>\n(her and I would do great here)...I agree. Then she went on to say <br/>\nthat Daddy is very strong so he would do great on the &quot;physical&quot; <br/>\n(her word not mine) challenges. She is right on. Apparently Raiden <br/>\nwould be great at the &quot;scary stuff&quot; too because he is strong like <br/>\nDaddy and not much afraid (ummm...yeah he is 13mos old). LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you had a fun and challenging day!!
