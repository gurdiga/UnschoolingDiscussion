Two big things <br/>\nI&#39;ve been learning are (a) learn his cues - meltdowns don&#39;t really <br/>\ncome out of nowhere even if it seems like it. There&#39;s something <br/>\nthat&#39;s been building somewhere if you look for it (b) learn *my* <br/>\nissues - for example, I have more trouble focusing on him and tuning <br/>\nout others and being calm if *I&#39;m* hungry and tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we *know* it&#39;s going to a long drawn out time before we eat <br/>\n(Christmas Eve at SIL&#39;s is notorious for starting the gathering <br/>\naround 3 and not getting to dinner until after 7!), we make sure to <br/>\npack snacks for DS - yes, there&#39;ll probably be tons of food BUT it&#39;s <br/>\noften mostly cookies and chips and sodas and such. We make sure to <br/>\npack some protein - sometimes we&#39;ll even make a big whatever (ham <br/>\nand cream cheese rollups for instance) and bring that as an <br/>\nappetizer for everyone - that way we *know* there will be *protein* <br/>\nfor DS - a major component, we&#39;ve found, in helping him maintain <br/>\nequilibrium.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding those particular things that are calming is important too. <br/>\nFor my DS, for instance, rubbing his back helps to keep him tuned <br/>\nin. And it helps me tune in to him as well and anticipate how things <br/>\nare going. If he&#39;s been going and going, I&#39;ll try to make a space <br/>\nnear me and call him over for a short rest - and I&#39;ll blow across <br/>\nhis hair - he likes that and it is calming to him. Then he can go <br/>\nback to running but in control of himself again. If there&#39;s not a <br/>\nlot of space for him to move (he HAS TO exert his muscles some), <br/>\nwe&#39;ll play &quot;basketball&quot; - I hold out my hand at his head level and <br/>\nhe bounces up and down just tapped my hand with his head so it looks <br/>\nas if I&#39;m &quot;dribbling&quot; him. A little of that, a hug, and he&#39;s off <br/>\nagain, but back to himself. One time I asked him what was going on <br/>\nwith him (it was one of those days) and he said his energy gauge was <br/>\ntoo full. So we worked out ways to get his energy gauge back into a <br/>\nbetter range.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know in advance that folks will be trying to interact, stick <br/>\nclose. I&#39;ve found that physical contact with me kind of bolsters him <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s having a hard time sociably. Just as I know that being <br/>\nclose to DH helps me because I&#39;m not a naturally social person.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really will work out over time.

In the heat of the moment, I find myself torn by 1) a<br/>\nfeeling of helplessness and 2) trying to respect where Fisher is and<br/>\n3) wishing I could find the magic button to just make the tantrum<br/>\nnoise (which hurts my ears) go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe helpless feeling comes from this:  once Fisher is upset, it&#39;s very<br/>\nunlikely that he&#39;ll go into another room, away from others, without<br/>\nbeing physically put there (which feels like punishment to him -- he<br/>\nhates it).  He also will hit me if I try to touch him when his mood is<br/>\nwrong, or yell if I try to talk to him or even look his way -- but a<br/>\nminute later, still crying the same way, he clings to me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nto know what to do sometimes.  To those watching, I may seem like I&#39;m<br/>\nbeing too &quot;hands-off&quot; during a tantrum, because in my experience the<br/>\nworst of it has to blow over before I can be helpful at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying this to complain -- his feelings are strong and he&#39;s<br/>\ndoing the best he can.  I&#39;m saying that this is why it&#39;s so important<br/>\nthat I get as skillful as I can at coaching and observing and finding<br/>\nsolutions before he gets really upset.  And when I do feel helpless, I<br/>\nknow that he will grow out of it, and that helps me remember that me<br/>\npunishing him or getting upset will NOT be the magic button that makes<br/>\nhim stop.  I still work to help him as much as I know how.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you to all who responded -- I love the idea of having a room for<br/>\nhim with snacks and comfortable things.  I will check in with him<br/>\noften.  I think we will bring two cars (we live 5 minutes away) so<br/>\nthat if he really needs to go home, one person can bring him and the<br/>\nothers can stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I love the idea of sometimes gently redirecting him in a voice<br/>\nloud enough so that others can hear.  Sneaky. &lt;G&gt;  I often try to be<br/>\nprivate when talking to him, but I think it will be helpful for family<br/>\nto see how we&#39;re dealing with things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>, SandraDodd@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/20/04 10:49:39 AM, ecsamhill@e... writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Everything your child does is not caused by you (or by unschooling).&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is true, but I will admit to having seen some people just not<br/>\nwatch <br/>\n&gt; their kids or not coach them very well at all and say it&#39;s because<br/>\nthey&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; unschooling, and that&#39;s unfortunate for all concerned.  &quot;They&#39;ll<br/>\ngrow out of it&quot; is <br/>\n&gt; another probably truth, but leaving them to grow out of it without<br/>\ndirect and <br/>\n&gt; regular assistance seems cruel to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Social situations do have some requirements that anyone who attends<br/>\nshould be <br/>\n&gt; aware of, and I don&#39;t see an advantage of a parent saying &quot;That&#39;s<br/>\njust the <br/>\n&gt; way he is&quot; while she&#39;s in the other room visiting with adults.

Your lap.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s too old to sit in your lap, find times every half hour or so to get <br/>\nhim aside and sit with him, hug him, touch his hair maybe (for lots of people <br/>\nthat&#39;s comforting--maybe you could comb his hair, and smell it, and say nice <br/>\nthings to him, and then go back out into the fray).   Sometimes still, with my <br/>\nkids all teens, if it looks like one is starting to be uncomfortable or <br/>\nagitated, I&#39;ll ask for help to get something out of the car, or ask him or her to <br/>\ncome in the back yard to see something. My mother-in-law has desert tortoises in <br/>\nher back yard, and that makes a peaceful break and opportunity for me to chat <br/>\nwith a kid who otherwise might start to get antsy to go home.  Those things <br/>\nwere even easier when they were littler.  &quot;Let&#39;s go play with the dog,&quot; or if <br/>\nthere&#39;s an ice run or grocery store trip needed, volunteer and take your kid(s).<br/>\n<br/>\nEven during the event you can take a little time out to review what&#39;s <br/>\nhappening next and what&#39;s expected of them, so that it&#39;s in shorter units than all <br/>\nday.

If you coach him with <br/>\neven a few specific phrases to use, you can both feel more comfortable.   <br/>\nMaybe one of the coaching moments could be what to do if he can&#39;t think of <br/>\nanything to say at all and starts to panic. Maybe he could say &quot;Just a minute&quot; and <br/>\ngo and talk to you for a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were little and going to birthday parties we would talk about <br/>\nthings to say when you get there, and that way they weren&#39;t just reciting what I <br/>\nhad said, but had a range of reasonable greetings and the reason for them.   <br/>\n&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; or &quot;Thanks for inviting me.&quot;  Then when they were leaving, <br/>\nthey would (if they remembered) say &quot;I had a good time,&quot; or something more <br/>\nspecific.   Sometimes I would (and still) say something like that when entering or <br/>\nleaving their rooms, and that reinforces the little courtesies some people <br/>\ndon&#39;t easily figure out on their own.

This is partly because I&#39;m new to <br/>\nhomeschooling in general and even newer to the concept of unschooling, though <br/>\nit seems to be close to what we&#39;ve been doing from the start.  Anyway, after <br/>\nreading Amy&#39;s story about her sensitive son, I simply had to write back.  I too <br/>\nhave a highly sensitive son, and without going into detail about his <br/>\ncondition, let me recommend a book that gave me the greatest insight into his <br/>\npersonality and how to make his environment more user friendly.  It&#39;s called The <br/>\nExplosive Child by Dr. Ross Green.  There is also a website for Parents and Teachers <br/>\nof Explosive Kids  at www.explosivekids.org.  We struggled with my son having <br/>\nmeltdowns at school, due to his inability to change gears, and low threshold <br/>\nfor frustration.  After discovering this book, we had a better understanding <br/>\nof Skyler and what he needed, but it took me until the beginning of this school <br/>\nyear to realize the school could not think outside the box enough to provide <br/>\nfor him.  Thankfully you are already unschooling- which has helped Skyler <br/>\ntruly draw upon his strengths, rather than highlighting his weaknesses.  It sounds <br/>\nas if you already have a grasp of your son&#39;s temperament and are probably <br/>\ndoing all the right things to help him.  Perhaps this book can give you the <br/>\nlanguage to explain his needs to your family.  If you can&#39;t convince them that your <br/>\nmethods are best, at least they can be respectful of the way you are helping <br/>\nhim.  Try to have confidence in your choices.  That confidence will be more <br/>\nconvincing to unsure relatives.  As for your specific problems with the <br/>\nholidays, the book will describe a process called collaborative problem solving where <br/>\nyour child can help you find alternative solutions.  You will be amazed how <br/>\nwell the child knows what he needs and can handle.  I liked the advice of giving <br/>\nhim an escape from the crowds and noise.  And if you decide the whole thing <br/>\nwould be too much, let your relatives know that he becomes painfully anxious <br/>\nduring these events, and perhaps you can bring him to visit them separately.  <br/>\nSmall, one on one visits may be more enjoyable for everyone involved.  Design <br/>\nthe visit around an activity your son enjoys, in an environment he feels most <br/>\nsafe and in control.  Discuss with him ahead of time what behavior is expected- <br/>\nas long as that behavior is within his consistent ability.  For those <br/>\nrelatives who lack the compassion, or education to understand your son&#39;s needs, you <br/>\ncould resort to giving it a name like anxiety disorder.  I&#39;ve found that medical <br/>\nlabels, while otherwise useless, can serve to impress and silence those <br/>\ncherished but ignorant relatives and friends.  Well, anyway, please check out that <br/>\nbook and website.  It sounds like you are way ahead of me- it took so long for <br/>\nme to get where you are already.  I had to unlearn so much of my own <br/>\nupbringing.  OK, I&#39;m done now- good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the sensitive child & the holidays (long)","postDate":"1103566459","msgId":101647,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjIwLjExMTQyMC4xNDU2LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":101646,"nextInTopic":101648,"prevInTime":101646,"nextInTime":101648,"topicId":101644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Being around other people seems hard for him right now, too.  *** Will the festivities be at your house this year?

Sometimes I or his dad would go up and<br/>\nknock on the door and visit a bit and usually he&#39;d come down shortly<br/>\nafter, ready to participate again. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you won&#39;t be at home will you at least have your own room where you&#39;re<br/>\nstaying?  You could let him know he could hang out in there if he needed<br/>\nto. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr in your car, if it&#39;s warm enough outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to take a little tent along, a kid tent, and set it up for Dylan<br/>\nin some out of the way place and put his blankets and favorite toys in<br/>\nthere.  <br/>\nThis might not work as well if there are other kids around.  They might<br/>\nwant to be in the tent too, but if it&#39;s mostly big people the tent can be<br/>\nreally cool because he can still listen in on conversations, but be in<br/>\nhis own secret place. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet him know you&#39;ll go outside with him if he needs to get out.  Go for a<br/>\nwalk.  Arrange with your partner to manage things while you&#39;re gone and<br/>\ntake off for twenty or thirty minutes.  The people in the house are going<br/>\nto have each other and be busy with conversation or whatever and won&#39;t<br/>\nreally be thinking of how long you&#39;re gone. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he ride a bike?  Can you take it with you.  If it&#39;s snowy, take a<br/>\nsled.  You can pull him around in the yard or street if there are no<br/>\nhills. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an age thing and it will pass for the most part.  There are<br/>\nfamily members that just aren&#39;t that much fun to be around let alone have<br/>\nto make nice with when you&#39;re seven.  (Or forty one&lt;g&gt;) <br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m looking for some suggestions in answering their concerns. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is getting frustrated or excited and you think it might<br/>\nescalate you can sneak a away to a quiet part of the house and talk a bit<br/>\nuntil he seems calmer.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the problem is mostly the expectation others have of how your kid<br/>\nshould be, just stop them. <br/>\nI once said, very sweetly to my brother in law, when he was expressing<br/>\nhis concern Dylan was playing PlayStation too much (on Christmas day, the<br/>\nday he received it!)   &quot;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not having a good time, if you&#39;d<br/>\nlike to go that&#39;s perfectly ok with me.&quot;  &lt;G&gt;  He stayed and he was<br/>\nnicer.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of time discussing the unschooling philosophy<br/>\nunless it was really apparent someone was genuinely interested.  Most<br/>\npeople who feel the need to tell us there&#39;s something wrong with our kids<br/>\ndon&#39;t really care about our philosophy.  They care about getting the kid<br/>\nto do what they want him to do at the moment.  That&#39;s not a kid problem. <br/>\n I&#39;d probably just say, &quot;Look, it&#39;s Christmas, things are hectic, give<br/>\nhim a break.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know your son is wonderful.  You understand him and you&#39;d like<br/>\neveryone to be able to understand him.  If it&#39;s too hard this year make<br/>\ndifferent plans next year.   And it probably won&#39;t matter to your son. He<br/>\nlikely will not even notice if people think he&#39;s being antisocial.   If<br/>\nyou can get past it in a calm and direct way you&#39;ll feel better.  <br/>\nEveryone is feeling more stress at Christmas, with travel and late hours<br/>\nand too much food and excitement.   A loving pat on your concerned<br/>\nuncle&#39;s arm and a reminder your son is only seven might be all it takes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] the sensitive child & the holidays (long)","postDate":"1103564613","msgId":101646,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQzcwRjQ1LjMwNjA5MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNxNnJsMCtndXBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNxNnJsMCtndXBrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":101644,"nextInTopic":101647,"prevInTime":101645,"nextInTime":101647,"topicId":101644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** Now the holidays are here...** Are your family gatherings pretty predictable?

The first part would <br/>\nbe just hearing their concerns, when your son isn&#39;t around.  Letting <br/>\nthem talk for a long time or asking follow up questions can help make <br/>\nthings clearer.  (The first sentence they offer may be the harshest <br/>\none.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily get worse as the conversation continues.)  <br/>\nTaking their comments back to their personal experience or their core <br/>\nvalues can help you comprehend their point of view, even if it is <br/>\nstrange or obnoxious.

I think at this point maybe the <br/>\nbest you can hope for is to say &quot;I understand your concern&quot;.   Take time <br/>\nuntil the next gathering to get perfectly calm and offer &quot;answers&quot; to <br/>\nthe concerns, if you feel you have to.

I&#39;ve<br/>\nread Raising Your Spirited Child, and I&#39;m getting a handle on my son&#39;s<br/>\nintense and wonderful personality, but the holidays do add some stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome background:  he very rarely wants to leave the house, and we<br/>\nrespect that.  I never ask him to go grocery shopping or errand<br/>\nrunning -- even when my husband is out of town, I hire someone to<br/>\nwatch my boys so I can get those things done.  I offer only things<br/>\nthat might be fun to him, and he usually refuses those as well.  If<br/>\nit&#39;s something that we&#39;ve planned with other people (extremely rare --<br/>\nless than once per month), I gently work with him through his crying<br/>\nand resistance (let him wear his pajamas in the car, take a snack and<br/>\nGameBoy and stuffed animal)  -- and then when we get there, he has a<br/>\n*great* time.  So often, it feels like an outing is just what he<br/>\nneeded, but I respect that the transition is very difficult for him<br/>\nright now, and I don&#39;t push it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing around other people seems hard for him right now, too.  The last<br/>\nfew times we&#39;ve been at extended family gatherings, he&#39;s played for a<br/>\nbit and then really locked into &quot;I want to go home.&quot;  We haven&#39;t even<br/>\nfinished our meal, so we try to find things for him -- the TV in<br/>\nGrandma&#39;s basement is a big one -- until we can finish up.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the holidays are here.  During present opening and dinner, his<br/>\ngrandparents and aunts and uncles would, I&#39;m sure, really like to<br/>\ninteract with him, at least a little.  I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;ll try,<br/>\nand he knows them all quite well.  But right now he&#39;s very shy, and it<br/>\ncomes across as &quot;rude.&quot;  I&#39;m a bit worried (breathe) that he&#39;s going<br/>\nto get overwhelmed and have an awful time, and cause quite a bit of<br/>\nirritation in others at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Live and Learn 2004, Anne Ohman talked about how she prepared her<br/>\nson for such gatherings, and then helped him through it, and then<br/>\ndebriefed with him afterwards.

I&#39;m starting to pick<br/>\nup hints that people think that our &quot;lenience&quot; is the cause of this<br/>\n&quot;unpleasantness.&quot;  (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s unpleasant, but I think they<br/>\nare starting to.)  To be honest, it hurts to see my son not<br/>\nappreciated by his own family -- usually a pretty loving group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for some suggestions in answering their concerns.  There&#39;s<br/>\nso much content to the belief and philosophy of unschooling, and I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to find the focus in relation to this.  Here&#39;s where I&#39;m going<br/>\nso far:  I think unschooling will give him the room to learn to deal<br/>\nwith his own personality and sensitivity.  In a few years I expect<br/>\nthat he&#39;ll be a lot more comfortable in social situations -- but he<br/>\nneeds this time to work through it on his own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101665,"nextTopicId":101666}}
