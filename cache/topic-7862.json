Other<br/>\ntimes I have been able to sit back and really watch for what was worrying<br/>\nme, and I was able to find the math  and writing skills I was looking for.<br/>\nAnd of course a couple of time my temper got the better of me and I snapped<br/>\nabout learning/school issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note we got a new computer program today,  Zap by Edmark, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve not seen my 8 year old for hours and hours.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaKK----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: K WORTHEN &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kworthen@...\">kworthen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nCc: &lt;kworthen@mediaone&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 06, 2000 4:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hello<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Wendy,<br/>\n&gt;                 We&#39;re actually doing the opposite of you.
