I have been a car<br/>\naccident<br/>\nvictim 5 times (as a passenger in each one) so believe me I<br/>\nsympathize.<br/>\n2 years ago (at a time when I was soooo sick and dd was<br/>\neven sicker <br/>\nand money was a word we whispered in hushed tones with the<br/>\nreverence<br/>\nheld by those who never have enough of it to make ends<br/>\nmeet)<br/>\nmy husband was hit by a truck doing 80 in stop and go<br/>\ntraffic (Marco was <br/>\ngoing 30).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a state police car in the lane next to my husband<br/>\nwhen it happened.<br/>\nHe was in our new Dodge Shadow and the guy in a Suburban<br/>\nslammed into him<br/>\njust as the police car was trying to get into that lane.<br/>\nIt was awful.  Getting that<br/>\nphone call from the state police was something I&#39;ll never<br/>\nforget.  I cried then.  I cried <br/>\nwhen doctors told me Marco was surprising everybody - the<br/>\ncops had phoned him in<br/>\nas dead at the scene and had actually called for the<br/>\ncoroner (who had just gone to another<br/>\naccident site with them) to come back and call it - with<br/>\nhow well his body was responding.<br/>\nI cried when he got home and you know what? Interestingly<br/>\nenough I sobbed my heart out<br/>\nwhen I saw what was left of our car (they had to saw open<br/>\nthe hood even just to get to the insurance papers in the<br/>\nglove compartment!).  Strange.  I never cry but I even<br/>\nsobbed like a baby<br/>\nwhen the insurance came through and it turned out to only<br/>\nbe enough to finish paying off <br/>\nthe wreck that had once been our car.  That whole time was<br/>\nsuch an emotional rollercoaster<br/>\nfor me.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are thankful for everyone not being more hurt than they<br/>\nare but you can&#39;t help but worry about <br/>\nthe $$$ end of it.  Everyone who had seen the car (from the<br/>\nmechanics to the people who processed<br/>\nthe pictures of the car) kept offering their condolences<br/>\nand then when I told them my husband was <br/>\nalive kept saying things like God was on his side! or He<br/>\nmust have had an angel with him! or stuff<br/>\nlike that.  Well, I don&#39;t believe in God per se but I do<br/>\nbelieve in the power of vibrations.  I decided at<br/>\none point enough belly aching (and with all the worrying I<br/>\nhad been doing I do mean BELLY ACHING, <br/>\nliterally) it was time to stop wondering why him, why us,<br/>\nwhy now? and start focusing on the positive.<br/>\nWhat&#39;s that song say? Accentuate the Positive? I did and I<br/>\nfound out about Herbalife and I started making<br/>\nsome money, working part time at home, around our<br/>\nhomeschooling and my 2 jobs.  I was able to quit my two<br/>\njobs and get off my 14 meds a day and turn sooo much<br/>\naround.  And I truly believe that if it <br/>\nhadn&#39;t been Herbalife it would have been something else<br/>\njust as wonderful simply because I was determined to focus<br/>\non the champagne we wanted not the lemons we&#39;d been handed.<br/>\n I have come to believe that we get what we focus on.  Like<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re driving - take your eyes off the road often<br/>\nenough and that&#39;s exactly where you&#39;ll probably end up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know it&#39;s hard but try to start each day focusing on the<br/>\ngood stuff you want and how great it will feel to<br/>\nget it.  If you&#39;re at all like me or feeling like I was You<br/>\nknow how to do depressed and frustrated already. Try doing<br/>\nexcited and anticipating.  I found a book Excuse Me, Your<br/>\nlife is Waiting and it took me to new heights.  It sure<br/>\ncame in handy on Sept. 11 when my husband was stuck in<br/>\nManhattan and I couldn&#39;t reach him for almost two days.  I<br/>\nwould highly suggest it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, this was just my two cents but I hope it helped.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t usually get this personal on the list but<br/>\nwhat you wrote touched me, I just hope maybe my experience<br/>\nwill help you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and Be well - Jacli<br/>\n____________________________________________________________<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 11/20/2001 at 7:29 PM <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Message: 19<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 13:36:15 EST<br/>\n&gt;   From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: OT: Accident<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We just got home from what was supposed to be a quick<br/>\n </span></blockquote>errand, but along the <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;ay we had a car accident.
