So this time I have a great<br/>\nexcuse.<br/>\nAnyway I wanted to send my little Here Here to your well<br/>\narticulated<br/>\nthoughts on the presence of peanuts.  Although I don&#39;t have<br/>\na problem<br/>\nwith peanuts I do empathize with folks who do.  Fortunately<br/>\nfor me<br/>\nsince I started using Herbalife 3 years ago I have<br/>\ncompletely gotten over<br/>\nmy citrus allergies and environmental allergies, thrown out<br/>\nmy pills and stopped<br/>\ngetting my 2 shots in each arm 2 times a week.  BUT.  I<br/>\nstill have allergy to milk <br/>\nand butter.  Now that&#39;s allergy not lactose intolerance.<br/>\nJust the smell of butter<br/>\nis enough to make me start hurling uncontrollably.  Think<br/>\nthere is a lot of peanut<br/>\nbutter out there?  Try looking for butter on the label next<br/>\ntime you go shopping.<br/>\nYou&#39;ll be surprised.  It&#39;s like air in America: it&#39;s<br/>\neveryWhere.  Fortunately they do list dairy<br/>\nbutter.  Usually.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I had an experience two years ago that really brought<br/>\nit home for me: I bought a <br/>\npackage of flavored Quaker rice cakes.  Turns out they had<br/>\ndairy butter and butter oil <br/>\nin them but rather than list it they just put &quot;natural<br/>\nflavors&quot;.  Incidentally these were supposed<br/>\nto be banana cakes and banana was NOT one of the natural<br/>\nflavors.  Anyway I bought em, ate 1/2 of<br/>\none and began &quot;the hurl&quot; and it took a process of<br/>\nelimination to figure out what had happened.<br/>\nAnd more than a couple of phone calls.  And a trip to the<br/>\nemergency room.  In the end Quaker<br/>\npromised to include the information on the labels and last<br/>\nyear they followed through.  But it has <br/>\nmade me a touch more cautious that&#39;s for sure (or as hubby<br/>\ndearest puts it: even more paranoid).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that every single one of us deserves to know<br/>\nEXACTLY what is in the food that we<br/>\nare spending our hard earned money on.  Even if its just<br/>\npeanuts :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and talk to you soon, Jacli<br/>\n<br/>\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  ***********<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 11/18/2001 at 6:39 AM <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;As to moving where there aren&#39;t peanuts, well that leaves<br/>\n </span></blockquote>nowhere on earth.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Peanuts are a legume and they grow like a weed in almost<br/>\n </span></blockquote>any climate.
