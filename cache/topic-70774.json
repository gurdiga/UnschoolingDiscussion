But, while reading some of the folks have posted, I <br/>\nrecalled another one.  Actually, it was pretty sad, because it was the <br/>\nmisunderstanding of a grandson of a friend of my mother ( confusing huh.. lol) .. resulting <br/>\nfrom his grandmother lying to him. ..<br/>\n<br/>\n The kid was about 3, his grandmother told him that if he didnt take his <br/>\nvitamins, his hair would fall out.  ( I know, ridiculous)    After meeting Landon, <br/>\nwho was about 6 mos old and totally bald, the little boy reprimanded me <br/>\nfirmly.  &quot;You need to give your baby more vitamins (shaking his little finger at <br/>\nme)&quot;   Of course I had no idea what he was talking about til his Grandmother <br/>\ntold me about her vitamin taking ploy.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70586,"nextTopicId":70782}}
