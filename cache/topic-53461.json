He&#39;s got his good points, <br/>\nbut his carpet bombing of this list almost drove me to unsub.  Actually, <br/>\nI just went on digest and any time I saw he was the predominant poster I <br/>\nwould just delete the entire digest.  The whole thing went on ad <br/>\nnauseum, and I know that from the length of time he was allowed to post <br/>\nhis diatribes  that he was given ample opportunity to ease up, but he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t.  It all just got very tiresome and -- booorrring.  I&#39;m really <br/>\nquite glad that he&#39;s moved on to other lists now -- voluntarily or <br/>\ninvoluntarily.      <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t view banning as censorhip -- though I guess one could argue that <br/>\nit is in the strictist sense.   One&#39;s own rights end where other&#39;s <br/>\nbegin.  If we were all out in a public park having a circle discussion <br/>\nand some person came right in the middle of our circle and started <br/>\nyelling and screaming about things that were not on topic -- would that <br/>\nbe censorhip if we asked that person to please pipe down and allow <br/>\neveryone to speak?  Would it be censorship if the discussion leader <br/>\nasked that person to please stay on topic if they decided to <br/>\nparticipate?   Wouldn&#39;t the screamer be censoring the speech of others <br/>\nif he continually yelled while they were trying to have their <br/>\ndiscussion?  The right of  free speech does not also carry the right to <br/>\ndisturb and disrupt.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Alicia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52046,"nextTopicId":53466}}
