Here in Kansas, when a child reaches the age of 7, you get <br/>\n(online or directly from the Kansas Board of Education) a form of intent. You <br/>\nfill out the name of your *home* school, your name, address, phone # (not <br/>\nrequired) and the name of your *keeper of records* (usually you) address, <br/>\nphone # (not required) That is it. You don&#39;t have to give your children&#39;s <br/>\nages or names. You do this one time, unless you have an address change. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think they (KBOE) actually use this information for anything except to <br/>\ncompile a mailing list that is sold to various private, independent, and <br/>\ncharter schools. Who in turn send out colorful pamphlets and letters telling <br/>\nhsers why they feel their idea of education is so like yours, so why don&#39;t <br/>\nyou send your dollars and children to their institution. I have read the law, <br/>\nit tells me I am a non-accredited private school. Technically, I could school <br/>\nothers children as well. If I were so inclined, I could apply for and go <br/>\nthrough the rigorous accreditation process. Why should I? There are many <br/>\nnon-accredited private schools in the state of Kansas. The Catholic schools <br/>\nin the area are just now going through this process at the behest of the <br/>\nKansas City Arch Diocese. (The two neighborhood parishes are in their third <br/>\nor fourth year of the five year long process) The local Catholic High School <br/>\nhas been issuing diplomas for years, many of the students graduated from the <br/>\nschool have gone on to college. This tells me that my homemade diploma (if I <br/>\nchoose to make and give one to Moly and Jack) will be accepted as well as <br/>\ntheirs. My point in all this rambling? Well, its like this. IF Kansas <br/>\nrequired me to do as little as submit an education plan, I would do so. Why? <br/>\nBecause submitting an education plan doesn&#39;t, IMHO, go against my unschooling <br/>\nvalues. Would I kowtow to the *establishment*? Yes, Plain and simple, my <br/>\nchildren are the most important people in the world to me. Could I live in a <br/>\nstate like Pennsylvania, with their regulations? Probably not. And not <br/>\nbecause the requirements are against my ideals, (because I know Unschoolers <br/>\nexist and thrive in Pennsylvania) but because I am too lazy to have to go <br/>\nthrough all those hoops. &lt;g&gt; This said, I just don&#39;t understand any ideal or <br/>\nmoral code that would allow me to be so antiestablishment as to go as far as <br/>\nhaving Moly and Jack removed from my home. (I am antiestablishment enough) I <br/>\nrespect the Bryant&#39;s stand on how they feel best to raise their children. I <br/>\nraise my kids that way too.
