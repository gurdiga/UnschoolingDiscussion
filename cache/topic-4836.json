I like math, I&#39;ve taken extra college courses<br/>\nbecause to me they are fun.  But, knowing math has certainly not made my<br/>\nlife better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is that if they need the math they will learn the math.  I know<br/>\nunschoolers who have gotten into Ivy League colleges who never touched a<br/>\nmath book, never made any efforts in the math department until they<br/>\nrealised they would need it to get into the college of their choice.

I think you can work to those <br/>\nstrengths.  My son &quot;gets&quot; numbers right away.  Is way advanced in math.  <br/>\nDaughter sees the world completely differently.  But I also see that she is <br/>\nthrilled when she does get a number concept.  Except she gets it while <br/>\nplaying the piano.  While playing a game.  Etc.  Not just sitting at the <br/>\ncomputer (remember paper and pencil??? gosh that was a long time ago).   <br/>\nReading is the same way here.  He sees patterns; she likes to be read to.  He <br/>\nreads a book; she illustrates it.  But all (and, yes, I think all of the info <br/>\nneeds to get thru eventually and not in so long a time that it becomes <br/>\nfrustrating -- a failure rather than a different learning approach) of the <br/>\ninfo is getting thru.  At different rates but getting thru.  In different <br/>\nways but getting thru.  I don&#39;t think this is forcing her to learn things she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to know.  I think this is enabling her to learn them in ways <br/>\nthat suit her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout comparing to her brother.  A bit of an issue around here.  She <br/>\ncompares.  I try not to.  When she brings it up, we talk about how much older <br/>\nhe is.  She now says she feels sorry for him because he has that much less <br/>\ntime to learn things!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I agree that each child is different and may learn differently.

It&#39;s a choice to see<br/>\nasking quick questions as being *lazy* and it&#39;s another choice to see<br/>\nanswering questions as allowing the kids to skate on our understanding.<br/>\nBecause you have a choice in how you view these issues, there is an element<br/>\nof wanting to control inherent in your choice to view them negatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI view such questions very differently. I do not think my children are lazy<br/>\nor trying to skate through things by asking me for quick answers. I am not<br/>\nprivy to all that is going on in their head, but if what goes on in mine is<br/>\nany indication having a question answered does not thwart thinking.  When my<br/>\nchildren call out for a quick math question I assume they are thinking about<br/>\nthey want to know and will continue to think after they have the answer.<br/>\nOver time they will integrate the information into their store of automatic<br/>\nrecall knowledge, just like they have done since they entered this world.<br/>\nRemember when you had a baby? Or a toddler? How many repetitions did it take<br/>\nfor them to learn to turn on the VCR?  How many times did they try to say<br/>\nwater, before it came out water instead of waawer?  I choose to value<br/>\nquestions for just what they are, requests for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I&#39;m going to complicate matters by saying that after all of this<br/>\nthinking about questions and what goes on  when a child asks a question, you<br/>\nmight be right, she might be choosing to be *lazy*.<br/>\nIf that is so, you have to ask WHY she&#39;s choosing to be lazy.  Is it<br/>\npersonality? Is it fear?  Why would she prefer help to thinking for herself.<br/>\nThis is where I believe school and having to have the *right* answer comes<br/>\nin and warps the learning process.   If we *schooled* learning to talk, we&#39;d<br/>\nhave a bunch of folks unable to speak and who eventually refuse to even try.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now, for the final point....there are times when the kids ask this or<br/>\nthat where I let it be known I think they ought to have already figured<br/>\nwhatever out.  I don&#39;t refuse to answer the question, and I do not shame<br/>\nthem by my response, but I also let them know that I have expectations and<br/>\nbeing able to ___________is one of them.   This is that fuzzy line between<br/>\nhaving a philosophy of education and parenting a human being.  It&#39;s a<br/>\ndelicate line of being able to answer them kindly and yet encourage their<br/>\nown growth.  What I use as a benchmark is the way I am treated by those<br/>\nstill helping ME learn things. I have mentors and quires and there are times<br/>\nwhen I ask for a quick and easy answer. A constant stream of figure it for<br/>\nyourself would cause me to move on and find new mentors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stop now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Susan and Theodore","from":"&quot;Susan and Theodore&quot; &lt;Stuff@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"u92KnMZWWuU_NAy01pURFTr3hiMtuBtu0CGLYs65pEf_b3LDLowPkzGSnofgZ0OPIKiqmv3xcSPwu6X7fM2Sw3WBoo28nslYLua8XDCH67N4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Quick and Easy Requests","postDate":"943779383","msgId":4931,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4zMTguNDkzMS45NTkyNjk3NDRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4930,"nextInTopic":4938,"prevInTime":4930,"nextInTime":4932,"topicId":4836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I keep wanting my daughters to &quot;look it up etc. but I think it is nuts<br/>\non my part.  I like easy answers personally and haven&#39;t found that looking it up<br/>\nmyself improves necessarily my knowledge.  I now know that I can look up<br/>\nsomething if I really need to.  If I really don&#39;t know and they really want to<br/>\nknow well then I can help them look it up if they want to. Otherwise I think it<br/>\nis more of that artificial rush to independence that we are brainwashed to<br/>\nbelieve is so important.  Gordon Neufeld in fact believe people should warmly<br/>\nrespond to their children&#39;s dependency.  Encourage it while it is there.  They<br/>\nwill become independent following natures&#39; plan for emergent independent<br/>\nself-hood.  This happens usually much later than we think.  The real centered<br/>\nself-hood emerges much more real and rooted when dependence has been welcomed and<br/>\nthe child is allowed to move out into the world at their own pace.  I think this<br/>\napplies to learning too.  In any case my older daughter detests it when I wax<br/>\npedagouish.  She lets me know.

We&#39;ve all pretty much discovered that rote memorization of<br/>\nthose facts does not bring understanding, it&#39;s actually putting it to use<br/>\nthat cements the knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if while you are cooking today you she asks is 1/2 the same as 2/4ths, I<br/>\nwould say yes, it is and 3/6ths, 4/8th are all the same too.  Or if she asks<br/>\nhow many 1/2&#39;s make a whole cup, I&#39;d answer and give her a bit more<br/>\ninformation.  Now she can THINK, she has information to think WITH.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that it&#39;s highly disrespectful to throw a question back into their<br/>\nfaces.  If they could figure it out, they wouldn&#39;t have asked the question.<br/>\nI suppose this feeling is strong for me because I cannot spell well.   I<br/>\njust don&#39;t see the patterns well enough to use them, as there are so many<br/>\nexceptions.  Telling a nonspeller to *look up* a word is just stupid, they<br/>\nhave to be able to spell it well enough to find it in the dictionary.  If I<br/>\ncould get close enough to use a dictionary, I wouldn&#39;t be asking how to<br/>\nspell something.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, learning is not being able to come up with the *right answer*.<br/>\nHaving the answer is a school thing.  Learning is that thinking and<br/>\ncommunicating process that brings understanding. Understanding is something<br/>\nwe use.  Give her the fractions information and let her use it, that will<br/>\nbring understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswering our children&#39;s questions is a privilege.  It&#39;s in those moments we<br/>\nget to peak into their thinking processes, we get to help them understand<br/>\nthe world we brought them into.  It would be a shame to thwart the very<br/>\nconnections we need open and healthy. just so we could feel in control.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n---- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: The O&#39;Donnells &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 24, 1999 11:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Quick and Easy Requests<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: The O&#39;Donnells &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:praxis@...\">praxis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 07:45 PM 11/19/99 +0000, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; She will do real life math almost always.
