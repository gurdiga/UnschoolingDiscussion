Depression.

One we inherited from an elderly neighbor;  it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t run. One can only be driven by Keith.  We could sell one and  still have <br/>\nautomobiles.  We could sell all and ride the bus, I suppose, but  that&#39;s hard <br/>\nto do in New Mexico.  Each of our driving teens has a regular  car to use, but <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t own it.  They use mine sometimes; Kirby did  tonight, so he could <br/>\ninclude his sister in a little outing (with her it was five  kids, and the <br/>\nother car only carried four).  We&#39;re really flexible about  who drives what.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have thousands of books.  I have given away and sold and traded and  <br/>\nacquired books throughout the years.  My store of books isn&#39;t all the books  in the <br/>\nworld.  My kids have books of their own, and we share back and  forth.  I <br/>\nthink any unschooler who gets rid of a book or even hundreds  isn&#39;t compromising <br/>\nunschooling.   I would think an unschooler who got  rid of ALL her books, or <br/>\nrefused to allow a child to read books, or  characterized book reading in <br/>\nnegative and belittling ways might be displaying  some questionable logic.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":103606,"nextTopicId":103613}}
