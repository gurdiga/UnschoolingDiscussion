My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-731263342\">Hello. I am new to the list. I have been lurking for about a week now. This is our first year homeschooling. We started out as classical homeschoolers. My daughter is fine with the structure and books, but my son just isn&#39;t. I have switched curricula repeatedly in certain subjects, and just decided a few weeks ago that we are going to give unschooling a try, because I am tired of fighting him to do his work. It is stressful, and I just don&#39;t like feeling like a dictator.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I have the usual questions...what do we do now, etc., but I think we are doing okay. We play games almost everyday, sometimes they play on the computer. My daughter reads every night in bed for a couple hours. She is becoming such an expert on animals at the age of 7! I realized a couple months ago that she is learning so much more science on her own than what I have taught her this year, I also noticed that she would know what certain sounds are, like -tion before I got to showing her because she figured it out on her own, and I starting realizing that there is no point having her study spelling lists with words like &quot;when&quot; because she is going to be able to spell these by next year anyway just because she reads so much!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my main reason for posting is that I am looking for other unschoolers and SECULAR groups in Illinois. I am in Sandwich, which is southwest of Aurora. I am probably about 1 - 1 1/2 hours from Chicago. Are any of you here in the Chicago land area or the DeKalb or Ottawa area? What groups do you belong to, and are there a lot of unschoolers? I belong to a small secular group out here. There is one family that pretty much unschools, but they are looking to move when their house sells. I would really like to find some real-life people!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nOlifGet more from the Web.
