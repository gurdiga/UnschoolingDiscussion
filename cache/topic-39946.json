When I first started homeschooling the concept of &quot;government <br/>\nschools&quot; really bothered me. But the longer I&#39;ve been at this, the more I&#39;ve <br/>\ncome to realize that it&#39;s the concept of compulsory schooling in any form <br/>\nthat is the culprit. It&#39;s the idea that there is a timetable for learning <br/>\nand that it can be structured and broken down and imposed on children. It&#39;s <br/>\nall those schoolish ideas  about how things are done, how things must be <br/>\ndone, that I feel are really damaging to children and the thinking and <br/>\nlearning process in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39942,"nextTopicId":39848}}
