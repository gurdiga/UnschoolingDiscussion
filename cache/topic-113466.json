He might be  <br/>\nwondering just when it&#39;s going to be taken away for &quot;more worthy&quot;  <br/>\npursuits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay to offer different activities to your son or &quot;strew&quot; around  <br/>\nyour home (see <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing)\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing)</a>. Those things should  <br/>\ncome with no expectations, though. If he wants to branch out, he will.  <br/>\nIn the meantime, why not find opportunities that feed his passion? Are  <br/>\nthere tournaments he could play in? Does he have gaming buddies? I  <br/>\nGoogled &quot;Lego Indiana Jones&quot; and there are countless sites, YouTube  <br/>\nvideos, and Lego to explore. What about the Indiana Jones movies? Does  <br/>\nhe like the IJ hat?

About 3 yrs. ago I decided that unschooling was the way to go with him. I have a lot of trouble with the fact that he plays the same vidoe game hour after hour, day after day, year after year. Honestly, year after year! I have not said anything about this to him, although his brothers tease him about it. <br/>\nI have tried getting involved in the game with him, but my boredom level just can&#39;t take any more!If I suggest a new game, he, ever eager to please, will play it for a short while and then revert to the old one. <br/>\nUnfortunately, too, I started suggesting other activities which I thought he may enjoy, and I have slowly allowed those activities to become more and more &#39;schooly&#39;. We are almost back to where we started with &#39;School at home&#39;. This happened without me really noticing, and was also easier in view of the fact that there is some family opposition to unschooling.<br/>\nMy question is, now what should I do?He will do whatever I suggest, and if I ask him what HE wants to do he can&#39;t think of anything.(Except for Lego Indiana Jones!!) He likes structure, and a set schedule. He has no definite direction and we have already exhausted any interests he has had. Should I totally de-school him again, or just be more conscious of what I suggest to him? Please help, any advice will be appreciated.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113432,"nextTopicId":113479}}
