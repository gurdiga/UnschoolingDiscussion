Recently, I had to switch back to using AOL 5.0 because one of the lists I am on rejected the messages. It seems that this version of AOL is sending out email messages in HTML and some receiving servers are interpreting the message as an attachment, and rejecting the message, if it is programmed to reject attachments. While I was using version 6.0, I would often receive messages with huge letters and other odd phenomenon. :) I have switched back to using AOL 5.0 and I am not having the problem anymore.<br/>\n  Now...before the AOL bashing begins, the new Earthlink upgrade is doing the same thing, so some of them have had some problems.<br/>\n   An introduction will follow in a seperate email. :)<br/>\n  Regards,<br/>\n    Sheree ( who still *loves* AOL after all these years) :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"parrishml@aol.com","from":"parrishml@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"lU4W-DFc68npQUGO1vXzsMkH58Xt5F3AB4pgOtaPM6PzQo540OjEQ1DsP11vmX_9CDF3gk6uJEg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: words of encouragement","postDate":"984758312","msgId":17047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhiLjNjM2I2MzYuMjdlMzkyMjhAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":17046,"nextInTopic":17091,"prevInTime":17046,"nextInTime":17048,"topicId":17046,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Marianne, I have to second Mary Ellen s advice.

If I came down on my 13yo daughter with <br/>\nsome kind of limit on her television watching, she would be angry, and a wall <br/>\nwould go up between us, making communication difficult. It&#39;s hard to trust <br/>\nthat this boredom and TV watching will end.

Of course, suggesting something like this to a <br/>\nteen-ager can be difficult.
