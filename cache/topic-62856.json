To be honest, I just don&#39;t get it<br/>\n(and if someone could explain to me why it&#39;s supposed to work I&#39;d<br/>\nappreciate it), but my 6 yo is having a hard time lately, and I&#39;d like<br/>\nto give it a shot.  I see that there are drops, a cream and a spray.<br/>\nWhat form do you recommend? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I don&#39;t know about this stuff but I do have some recent experience with<br/>\nhomepathic remedies. I&#39;ve been listening to a few here just rave about the<br/>\nremedies. It&#39;s been suggested many times from colds to my kids crying and<br/>\nbeing angry. Well I had a bad experience with the remedies last Dec. when my<br/>\nkids were sick for the umpteenth time and I was at my wits end. Didn&#39;t know<br/>\nenough about the stuff and obviously the lady at the store gave us the wrong<br/>\nthing because it was a total waste. Well I decided I wanted to try this<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went the bookstore to get the kids some body and sex books, I picked<br/>\nup a homeopathic book. I read it from cover to cover and also did some<br/>\nreseatch on the net. After feeling confident, I headed out for the local GNC<br/>\nand picked up $40.00 worth of remedies. Covered just about everything in our<br/>\nfamily. Only thing I didn&#39;t find was something for Joe&#39;s pain recently from<br/>\na disc problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I started to give Sierra something and also something else I picked up as<br/>\nwe both have eczema. Two different remedies. I used no cortisone cream as<br/>\nusual and both of us have healed up almost completely within 3 days.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other afternoon, day before park day, Alyssa wasn&#39;t looking right. I<br/>\nasked what ws wrong and she complained about her nose. I felt her forehead<br/>\nand she was hot. Figures, right before park day. So I grabbed one of the<br/>\nremedies I got, gave her a dose and later another. She made park day all day<br/>\nyesterday and has been fine ever since. In fact she&#39;s asking me to take<br/>\nmore. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra was in the shower the other day along with a lizard. She totally<br/>\nfreaked. And when it comes to unexpected bugs or lizards, it&#39;s not just a<br/>\nscreaming thing, she totally loses it. I gave her another remedy I picked up<br/>\nand she calmed right down wnough so she could finish her shower.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Joseph accidently closed his door on Alyssa&#39;s fingers. She was<br/>\nscreaming. I gave her remedy, she calmed down and fell asleep in my arms. I<br/>\nput her to bed, it was about 10:10 p.m., way earlier than usual. She woke up<br/>\nthis morning at 10:45 not even knowing which hand was injured last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m almost afraid to say this stuff is wonderufl. I keep thinking it&#39;s a<br/>\nfluke!!! But I figured out something I got for something else is perfect for<br/>\nJoseph&#39;s anger problems. He had 3 episodes yesterday and I am going to see<br/>\nif this helps him with that. I&#39;m a believer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62671,"nextTopicId":62876}}
