Sandra mentioned something about being too<br/>\n&gt; tired to cook one eve. and that her kids were old<br/>\n&gt; enough to make something for themselves anyway. Maybe<br/>\n&gt; the distinction is that we dont have a right to demand<br/>\n&gt; anything of anyone. But cant we expect a little help.<br/>\n&gt; Taking some responsibility for oneself? &quot;Expect&quot; may<br/>\n&gt; even be too harsh a word.

Am I on the right<br/>\n&gt; track?<br/>\n&gt;  I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>\n&gt; not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>\n&gt; that he/she is a part of the family. ( I believe that<br/>\n&gt; we all choose very purposefully where to<br/>\n&gt; incarnate--not that &quot;they did not ask to be born and<br/>\n&gt; therfore they are not responsible&quot;--like they are<br/>\n&gt; innocent bystanders or something). Are you saying that<br/>\n&gt; if they want to eat in their room and dont want to<br/>\n&gt; pick up the fallen food and then there is a big ant<br/>\n&gt; infestation that they dont need to take responsibility<br/>\n&gt; for that? I dont think thats what you mean. I did read<br/>\n&gt; some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>\n&gt; That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>\n&gt; etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>\n&gt; mess. We dont want to trash our kids for the sake of<br/>\n&gt; an ant infestation. I love that point she made. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>\n&gt; actions. I dont think its a given that the parents are<br/>\n&gt; responsible for everything. Probably nature will take<br/>\n&gt; its course in these instances, over time, as it does<br/>\n&gt; everwhere and the kids will strive to be responsible<br/>\n&gt; -&quot;because that is their nature&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, thanks.<br/>\n&gt;   Kathy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

My goal is to put the relationship first and then figure<br/>\nout how to fit other things in without damaging it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost parents say &quot;I put my children first BUT ...&quot; But that &quot;but&quot; changes<br/>\nstatement. If you&#39;ve ever made a child cry or get angry or slam doors over<br/>\nsomething to do with the house then at those times the chores are coming<br/>\nfirst. Most parents may feel the times their children come first are enough<br/>\nto balance out the times they don&#39;t. (Even more important, I think, is what<br/>\nthe children think!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s your thought, then none of this will make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut one thing that shifted my thinking was realizing I was making withdrawls<br/>\nfrom my relationship with my daughter to pay for something that would be<br/>\ngone tomorrow. And I&#39;d have to do that everyday. In 10 years what would I<br/>\nhave to show for all those withdrawls?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If this is so, then when does that change?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When do (in my opinion) the chores not belong to the parents? Never.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat *doesn&#39;t* mean the parents must chores alone while the kids play until<br/>\nthe kids leave the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it this way. What if your child played a video game every day. What<br/>\nif there were parts of the game that he had to do but didn&#39;t like to do to<br/>\nget through the day&#39;s task. What if he decided that because you were there<br/>\nthat automatically made you part of the team in the things he thought were<br/>\nimportant. What if he assigned you parts of the game to do everyday? What if<br/>\nhe *expected* you to do it just because it was important to him and he<br/>\ndecided it was your job to help out?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems ridiculous. But to kids the things we think are important are<br/>\njust as ridiculous. *If* you look at chores from an adult understanding<br/>\nyou&#39;ll never understand why kids don&#39;t just pitch in. If you look at chores<br/>\nfrom a child&#39;s understanding, you&#39;ll get why the kids feel imposed on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son wanted you to help with his video game, how could he ask? If you<br/>\nlook at chores from a child&#39;s understanding, then it&#39;s a whole lot easier to<br/>\nfigure out what are good ways and bad ways you could ask for help to get<br/>\nhonest to goodness help, not forced conscription.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But cant we expect a little help.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If we model helping them, then they will help us. (On *their* schedule.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(And the help has to be helping *them* not doing for them the things we<br/>\nthink they should do. Making dinner isn&#39;t really helping them. Cleaning up<br/>\nafter them isn&#39;t really helping them. Taking time from what you&#39;re doing to<br/>\ndo something that they feel is important -- even if and perhaps *especially*<br/>\nif you don&#39;t see it as important -- models helping for them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we model that we think it&#39;s fair to conscript help because what we want<br/>\nis more important than what they want, then what are they learning about how<br/>\nto handle situations where their needs conflict with other people&#39;s needs?<br/>\nWe&#39;re essentially saying that being bigger and stronger means you get to<br/>\nhave what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe *can&#39;t* expect them to understand the importance of what we need to do.<br/>\nThey won&#39;t truly understand until they are adults and choose to do it<br/>\nthemselves. (And we can&#39;t force that understanding because forcing them to<br/>\ndo something isn&#39;t the same as knowing you have full freedom of choice to do<br/>\nsomething or not and know the consequences are truly yours to own.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we want is to model giving based on the importance someone that we care<br/>\nabout places on something. We want them to say &quot;Okay&quot; when we ask because we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t ask unless it was something very important. But what we model for<br/>\nthem is judging the importance *we* place on something and deciding if it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant enough to interrupt for. For instance if they ask us to drive them<br/>\nto the store for a new game, we can&#39;t see that as important so we place it<br/>\nlow on our priority list. But then when we ask them to pick up the toys, we<br/>\ndon&#39;t accept that as being low on *their* priority list. We expect them to<br/>\nput it high on their priority list just because it&#39;s high on ours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Taking some responsibility for oneself? &quot;Expect&quot; may<br/>\n&gt; even be too harsh a word.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re assuming that if you give then you&#39;re entitled to get something back.<br/>\nBut giving means you&#39;re doing it because you have a gift that you want to<br/>\ngive someone *not* because you expect something in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, for instance, you decided you wanted to give them a big yard to play in,<br/>\nwhy would the job of maintaining that yard then fall on the kids? Is it<br/>\nreally a gift if they&#39;re required to maintain it to your standards? And if<br/>\nit&#39;s theirs then can they decide to turn it into a meadow so they can keep<br/>\nit to their standards?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But cant we explain that<br/>\n&gt; (for example, if this were the case) mom or dad have<br/>\n&gt; xy &z going on and that we cant do all that needs to<br/>\n&gt; be done and still keep our sweet and happy tones<br/>\n&gt; going?

Am I on the right<br/>\n&gt; track? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. The kids are not responsible for your emotions. Your emotions are yours.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re getting upset, then it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re trying to control<br/>\nthem and they aren&#39;t cooperating. You&#39;re trying to get them to do what you<br/>\nwant them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne answer is to figure out how to stop wanting whatever it is you want them<br/>\nto do. Another is to figure out how to get what you want without depending<br/>\non them. Another is to tackle the thing you&#39;re getting upset about and<br/>\nfigure out how to minimize task. (Rethinking how you do laundry. How the<br/>\nfamily gets fed. Where toys get put away. There are probably parts that you<br/>\ndo that you really don&#39;t need to like folding, or sorting or having 3 meals<br/>\na day. If your kids are more important then it will be important to really<br/>\nrethink the things you think are necessary and figure out how they can stop<br/>\nyou from damaging your relationship with your kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I dont really understand how a child in a family is<br/>\n&gt; not already on the team just by virtue of the fact<br/>\n&gt; that he/she is a part of the family.

What they came for is our<br/>\nlove and time. Not the work we can get them to do to maintain the life we<br/>\nwant to &quot;give&quot; them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;d prefer to live with you in a tar paper shack so that they could<br/>\nhave the freedom to be messy and have more time to spend with you and your<br/>\nhusband. So anything else you spend time on is giving them gifts that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t really want. They are gifts that *you* want to give them. It helps our<br/>\nattitude a lot to see what we give them as things *we* want to provide and<br/>\n*not* as something we expect them to appreciate. Then we can accept<br/>\nownership of them. Or drop them if we realize we&#39;ve been doing something<br/>\nonly because we felt we had to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; just talking about teaching responsibility for ones<br/>\n&gt; actions.

I did read<br/>\n&gt; some of Sandras stuff in the archives related to this.<br/>\n&gt; That it all depends on whats going on in the family<br/>\n&gt; etc, who has the time and energy to help clean up the<br/>\n&gt; mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are seeing that the relationship between parents and chldren is a battle<br/>\nof wills. It&#39;s about who gets to do what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see it as being there to help kids live life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would kids *want* to do things that are destructive or don&#39;t make sense?<br/>\nThe answer is that they don&#39;t. (Unless things are forbidden or controlled.)<br/>\nBut there is something that is preventing them from making the connection<br/>\nbetween their actions and the consequences. It could be that they&#39;re just<br/>\noblivious to their environment. It could be they haven&#39;t truly made the<br/>\nconnection between bugs and food. (Understanding a fact (bugs like food)<br/>\nisn&#39;t the same as understanding that it applies in a particular situation.<br/>\nAnd maybe it doesn&#39;t! Does it make sense that bugs outside will &quot;know&quot;<br/>\nthere&#39;s food in a bedroom? *Especially* if you are in the habit of saying<br/>\nsomething *will* happen when in truth it *may* happen.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we approach life with them with the attitude that what they need is<br/>\ninformation or skills or reminders, and once we stop trying to make them be<br/>\nthe way we want them to be and accept where they are, then life is a lot<br/>\nless stress filled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they accept that food in bedrooms equals bugs, when you see them heading<br/>\nto their bedrooms with food you can keep reminding them that it&#39;s a better<br/>\nidea to eat in the kitchen and suggest that they could bring something to<br/>\ntheir food. (How to Talk So Kids Will Listen has a lot of good tips about<br/>\nwording to use.) If you&#39;ve reminded them numerous times, it could be they<br/>\njust aren&#39;t aware enough of what they&#39;re doing and you&#39;ll have to wait for<br/>\nmaturity to take care of understanding what they&#39;re hearing. And accept that<br/>\nyou&#39;ll have to make plate sweeps a couple of times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an example of not remembering. Our bathroom is dark but is off a very<br/>\nbright hall. The light switch is outside the door. Now I really want to<br/>\nconserve electricity and I don&#39;t want to leave lights on unnecessarily. But<br/>\nas you&#39;re coming out of the bathroom, there&#39;s no visual clue to remind you<br/>\nthat the light behind you is on because it&#39;s so bright in the hallway. So I<br/>\noften forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could someone help me to remember? Should they tell me to get up from<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m doing later and turn off the light? Should they get angry because<br/>\nI&#39;m 46 yo and am old enough to remember for myself? Or should whoever&#39;s<br/>\npassing by just turn off the light?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] helping with household stuff","postDate":"1045023827","msgId":58523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE4Zi4xNjE5NTJjYy4yYjdiMjY1M0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58517,"nextInTopic":58534,"prevInTime":58522,"nextInTime":58524,"topicId":58308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/11/03 7:03:25 PM, devapriya108@yahoo.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-90675504\">In a message dated 2/11/03 7:03:25 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:devapriya108@...\">devapriya108@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; OK, I guess the answer is that we have to be<br/>\nwilling to deal with a NO from them.

My ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1117119966\">Wow, I just found out about this list and it has been<br/>\nfascinating reading. It is really helping me figure<br/>\nout how to approach unschooling more clearly. My<br/>\nquestion is about the kids helping with household <br/>\nmaintenance. I do like a pretty tidy house and realize<br/>\nthat it is not necessarily everyone elses priority.<br/>\nBut forget *tidy*.  How have you all handled the<br/>\nbasics? Trash, dishes etc. Have you had a meeting and<br/>\ntried to see how the things can get done so that<br/>\neveryone agrees?  I like the idea of working things<br/>\nout very democratically, where everyone is involved in<br/>\nthe running of the house or whatever decisions have to<br/>\nbe made. It is all worked out as a team. Any<br/>\nsuggestions? <br/>\nThanks.<br/>\nKathy Evans<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

How many times do kids come to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1726623227\">I truly think that most kids want to help out....they just might want to do<br/>\nit in ways other than how you are asking them to.  How many times do kids<br/>\ncome to ask us if they can help us do something and have been told &quot;no, a<br/>\ngrown up really needs to handle this&quot; or &quot;no, I&#39;m in a giant hurry.  How<br/>\nabout helping tomorrow?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I&#39;ve done it in the past.  I have 5 kids and the clutter gets<br/>\nimmense.  I have even posted on here about my kids &quot;not helping and treating<br/>\nus poorly&quot;....usually because I&#39;ve placed some pressure on myself and am,<br/>\nsubconsciously, wanting the kids to pick up extra slack.  So I decided to be<br/>\nscientific.  I made a chart of each kids name down 2 columns.  One column<br/>\nfor when the kids asked if they could help and another for when they did<br/>\nsomething helpful whether asked to or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  My 4yo loves to help move laundry from machine to machine.  It<br/>\ntakes quite a bit longer than if I did it myself but he is offering his help<br/>\nto me so he got &quot;credit&quot; on the chart.  Zach loves to carry in groceries,<br/>\nnot to be helpful, but to get first viewing of whatever treasures I might<br/>\nbring home.  Its not altruistic, but it is helpful, so again, he got credit.<br/>\nI was in the midst of making soap that wasn&#39;t gelling so I asked Adriane if<br/>\nshe would get lunch for the little kids.  She did and got &quot;credit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did this for about 3 days and was blown away at how helpful the kids are,<br/>\noften without being asked.  What I had been getting bummed about wasn&#39;t the<br/>\nkids not helping (like I thought) but about the kids not being under my<br/>\ncontrol (yuck).<br/>\n<br/>\nI still do this occassionally when I get into &quot;Why do I have to clean all<br/>\nthis mess?&quot; mode.  It is always a good reality check.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58664,"nextTopicId":58670}}
