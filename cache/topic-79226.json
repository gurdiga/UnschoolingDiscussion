Fleas like to live on <br/>\nanimals and not in bedding or dirt. They&#39;ll hop up on a dog or cat <br/>\nquickly as soon as they hatch. It&#39;s possible they are cycling through <br/>\na flea hatch everytime you go. Unfortunately others who board their <br/>\nanimals are in denial about their dogs having fleas...so everyday a <br/>\nnew crop can waltz in the door. As much as I hate fleas, I hate the <br/>\ninsecticides that some places use. Fleas can become resistant to the <br/>\nbest and safest poisen too. So I have no answer really but it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsurprise me. Maybe someone has run a kennel and will share with us. <br/>\nSara<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; .

Avery got up shortly<br/>\n<br/>\nafter 6, and the birthday boy slept in until 9. I had pizza ready <br/>\n<br/>\nfor Jaiden when he got up, that was what he decided he wanted for <br/>\n<br/>\nbreakfast last night. After the pizza we made cupcakes, strawberry <br/>\n<br/>\nwith chocolate and vanilla frosting. Right now, Jaiden is in his room <br/>\n<br/>\nwatching Scooby Doo, with the Adams Family, his recent favorite family,<br/>\n<br/>\nand every few moments yelling out to me in the livingroom(on the &#39;puter)<br/>\n<br/>\nwhats happening. Avery is in the livingroom with me watching Dora. The<br/>\n<br/>\nboys are also playing with legos, blocks, and cars right now too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will just be hanging out, doing whatever we want to until Jason<br/>\n<br/>\ngets home, them we have to run some errands. We have a mission, <br/>\n<br/>\nJaiden want&#39;s skulls, spiders, and rats as part of the decorations<br/>\n<br/>\nfor the huge pirate party he&#39;s having. He started planning this party<br/>\n<br/>\naround x-mas of last year. He&#39;s done every thing for this party, guest list<br/>\n<br/>\nfood, decorations. All we&#39;ve done is take him to the stores he&#39;s wanted<br/>\n<br/>\nto go to and bought what he wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, aftet our running around we are having fried chix, mashed potatoes, <br/>\n<br/>\nbrocoli, and buscuits for dinner. Jaiden picked it all out last night at <br/>\n<br/>\nthe store We are going to the zoo tonight, they have a huge zoo at dark thing, <br/>\n<br/>\nand it shouldn&#39;t be to crowded tonight. We have plans to watch the &quot;Two Towers&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\ntonight, but we may not. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, thats today.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.

Dallen (9) is playing <br/>\nAtlantis Underwater Tycoon, Phillip (6) is playing Warcraft III The Frozen Throne, <br/>\nand as you can see I am answering E mail, also making some herbal tea for our <br/>\nthroats, we picked up a cold at the conference as well, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yesterday this is how it went.  Same AM as that is our usual routine when <br/>\nwe wake up.  Then I think Dallen had a turkey roll for breakfast while <br/>\nPhillip had some pita chip things and kool aid.  I had more tea and some chocolate <br/>\ncovered peanuts, yummmm.  Played with the dogs.  Fed all the animals.  Watched <br/>\na little TV then dressed and off to play group.  Had a little discussion with <br/>\nPhillip so that he knows that by not brushing his hair it is starting to dred <br/>\nin the back.  He didn&#39;t care so off we went.  Play group until everyone went <br/>\nhome (the boys always want to be the last ones there).  Came home and I checked <br/>\nE mail while Phil played on the computer and Dallen was drawing some pictures <br/>\nof robots.  Flea sprayed the dogs, they picked up fleas while we were away. <br/>\nHelped Phil climb a tree and listened to Dallen talk about his robot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWent out for supper with my best friend and the boys stayed home and played <br/>\ngames with Jackson.  I went to Toys R Us while out and picked up some YuGiOh <br/>\ncards, the Tow Towers DVD and Stitch video.  We watched Stitch and a little TV, <br/>\nI watched as they finished up a game they were playing and we went to bed <br/>\naround midnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam G.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yea, I had a question for you guys that know anything about dogs.  This is <br/>\nthe second time that my dogs have gone to be boarded while we are on vacation <br/>\nthat they have come back just loaded with fleas.  When I picked up the dogs <br/>\nthe owner of the kennel said she gave my dogs a bath free of charge and they <br/>\nwere clean but that just made the fleas easier to see.  I had used the drops for <br/>\nfleas before we left but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  Is this normal for a <br/>\nkennel?  Or should I be looking for a new kennel?  I know they are there with lots <br/>\nof other dogs but I am just not sure if I should expect this.  It is really a <br/>\npain to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":79281,"nextTopicId":79272}}
