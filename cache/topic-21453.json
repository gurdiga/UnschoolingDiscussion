I have to ask, though, because I have been<br/>\nwondering, based on the little I&#39;ve read, and the<br/>\ncomments made in your post...(and based on my own<br/>\nexperience)...what if they express interest and<br/>\nability in learning academics before they are<br/>\n&quot;supposed to&quot; at age 7? Would the Waldorf philosophy<br/>\nadvise discouraging this interest? My first, and<br/>\nespecially my third sons, seemed to want to things<br/>\nlike read and write, (and math, in my 5 yr olds case)<br/>\nat an early age...without any incentive from me, that<br/>\nI can remember. I have just been curious about this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have enjoyed some of the gentle parenting methods<br/>\nthat the Waldorf philosphy espouses, but some is also<br/>\ntoo rigid for me. I am, however, an advocate of the<br/>\n&quot;continuum concept&quot; philosophy, which believes that<br/>\nchildren learn by mimicing....and will pick up the<br/>\nskills they need when it becomes relavant to them. I<br/>\nhave to admit, I have occasionally lost my trust in<br/>\nthat innate ability, but, I&#39;m back to it...ready to<br/>\ntake that leap of faith into &quot;unscooling&quot;, which is<br/>\nwhy I&#39;m here!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nGina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\n&quot;Oh No!&quot; Not another learning experience!&quot; -- bumper sticker of a good friend<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

GROSS (for teachers).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they are herded through the read-now chute, and those who balk are branded <br/>\n&quot;slow&quot; and &quot;non-reader&quot; and eventually a goodly number of them end up held <br/>\nback or in special ed, and because of reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a horror show paid for by taxpayers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was afraid and embarrassed (afraid of in-laws) when my first child wasn&#39;t <br/>\nreading at seven, and so he had two and a half reading-sessions (with me) <br/>\nwhich traumatized us both, and I never ever did that again.   Now my in-laws <br/>\nare afraid of me, and my two older kids read.  Kirby was nine when it kicked <br/>\nin, and I credit Nintendo Power magazine and the player&#39;s guide for Super <br/>\nMario above all else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty was ten, and his epiphany came with the player&#39;s guide to <br/>\nSomething-of-Fire (he&#39;s not here to ask), which he took apart and put into <br/>\nplastic sheet-protectors in an old cloth-covered three ring binder and he <br/>\ndecorated with markers.

For a child a <br/>\nthree to be able to count to 50 would mean that child has been taught <br/>\nto count to 50 - rote learning. It would only be the exceptional <br/>\nchild that would have discovered 1 - 50 by himself. Most three to <br/>\nfour year olds only understand numbers 1 - 5. That&#39;s all they need to <br/>\nunderstand.<br/>\n <br/>\nBTW who is Michelle Lewis?? <br/>\n <br/>\nThe same goes with reading. To be able to recognise letters, they had <br/>\nto be taught that. My three-year old has no need to know the letters. <br/>\nHe is still perfectly happy for me reading to him. Once he shows the <br/>\ndesire to read to himself - he tells stories at the moment - we will <br/>\nmove on to phonics.<br/>\n <br/>\nI find this list to be very un-unschooling. This list is grounded in <br/>\none school of though, but there are many others. Rudolf Steiner&#39;s <br/>\nview on reading and writing is quite different.<br/>\n <br/>\nSchooling only starts at age seven - the first year the children <br/>\nlearn to write - a natural extension of their artistic skills and it <br/>\nis only in the second grade - would be age eight - that they start to <br/>\nread.<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.capeannwaldorf.org/caws-faq.html\">http://www.capeannwaldorf.org/caws-faq.html</a><br/>\n <br/>\nWould be interesting to hear other people&#39;s views on this.<br/>\n <br/>\nDalene</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"mamkmm2@prodigy.net","from":"mamkmm2@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"h2EXCERk0mU4jB_xoFnTaGOurbJ7LAE1t25xQ4C8X_hN81gueT2pghcvYukrBPoz-3K3GCZKU2_mDw","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Pre-schooler skills+","postDate":"990308393","msgId":21455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDllNnA3OStyajM0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTkwMWMwZTBhOSQxOTcwZWRhMCRjMjU1MzdkMkBocHBhdj4="},"prevInTopic":21453,"nextInTopic":21458,"prevInTime":21454,"nextInTime":21456,"topicId":21453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think these lists were meant to be absolutes.

Two of my <br/>\nchildren have &quot;met&quot; these goals, one is too young (just 2) though <br/>\nprobably not far off from meeting the two year list, and one who was <br/>\na &quot;late bloomer&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith any list you will have to take into account the maturity level <br/>\n(and I don&#39;t mean this snidely), hand/eye coordination level, and <br/>\nphysical maturity of each individual child.  Some kids are late <br/>\nwalkers (or the reverse), some kids are late talkers (or the <br/>\nreverse), and some kids just don&#39;t work on the same schedule as your <br/>\naverage list of base &quot;norms.&quot;  Look at the childhood of such figures <br/>\nas Einstein and Thomas Edison.  They were both, without a doubt, <br/>\ngenuises in their fields but at the same time were late bloomers in <br/>\nthat their school teachers and others in general considered their <br/>\nintelligence to be substandard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t consider there to be a problem unless you child has met <br/>\nNONE of these basic steps by the age of about four or five.  Then I <br/>\nwould look to see if they have a learning challenge or their learning <br/>\nstyle is conflicting with your method of educating them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I know this is a unschooling list and some people are really <br/>\nhot for this .... their are children with whom this method/lifestyle <br/>\nis not maximumly effective.  A parent may be a complete unschooler in <br/>\napproach to life and education, but that does not necessarily follow <br/>\nthat their child will be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you little one is only 4, I would just give them some time.  My <br/>\nson was a reluctant reader and it took some real work on both our <br/>\nparts to get him past this absolutely necesary hurdle and help him to <br/>\ndevelop the must-have skill of reading.  He enjoys it now, but he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t when he first started.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once said &quot;timing is everything&quot; and you can&#39;t &quot;rush the <br/>\ncook.&quot;  Same is true with kids, things will eventually click in ... <br/>\nbut maybe not &quot;on schedule.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In Unschooling-dotcom@y..., &quot;Dalene Mactier&quot; &lt;Mactier@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; BlankHi All<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone pointed me to this list of skills to be mastered by 2, 3 <br/>\nand 4 year olds.
