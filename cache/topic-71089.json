There&#39;s so many different ways to do it. The unit studies sound like the best mix of things so far, though I&#39;m not sure I completely understand them yet. I know in the beginning I&#39;ll be worried about the testing. He&#39;ll have to do standardized testing every year starting at 8 years, or be evaluated by a teacher who does a report on him. Blech. So with the unit studies, we&#39;d have the basic textbook type thing and reading other books, but all the creative, go with the flow stuff too. If we did total un-schooling, I&#39;d be scared that we&#39;d miss things that the &quot;state&quot; believes he should know and we&#39;d get in trouble. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren (in CT)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71436,"nextTopicId":71444}}
