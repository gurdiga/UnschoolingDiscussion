I laugh<br/>\nbecause Sandra has really been being so restrained.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m also laughing because of the coincidence of a parallel discussion<br/>\nabout ecological concerns.  Interestingly, Rudolf Steiner, the founder of<br/>\nthe Waldorf method in Germany during the pre-WW2 years, had some very strong<br/>\nfeelings about ecology and a mystical reverence for the natural world that<br/>\nare expressed in his educational philosophiesand are still taught today, but<br/>\nhave also been linked by some to the modern skinhead movement and a new,<br/>\nrising interest in Germany in what is being called &#39;eco-fascism.&#39;  That&#39;s an<br/>\ninteresting little connection for you, and a fascinating argument.  (For<br/>\nmore, and I DARE you to read the whole thing and give it some honest<br/>\nthought, see an admittedly left-wing perspective at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spunk.org/library/places/germany/sp001630/janet.html.)\">http://www.spunk.org/library/places/germany/sp001630/janet.html.)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, back to the basic question...Waldorf...not controlling?  This<br/>\nschool of thought came out of the mind of a nationalistic, racist, religious<br/>\nfanatic German philosopher whose works were eventually adopted by some of<br/>\nthe major figures in Hitler&#39;s regime, Rudolf Hess among them.  By the very<br/>\nnature of the Teutonic/Aryan beast that grew during the Weimar Republic and<br/>\nexploded upon the world scene during the years of the Third Reich, the word<br/>\n&#39;controlling&#39; is as integral a part of the equation as is &#39;anti-Semitic.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeyword search Anthroposophy as well as the obvious search words, and see<br/>\nfor yourself.  It makes for interesting reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf COURSE Waldorf is controlling.   It came from Germany in the early part<br/>\nof the 20th Century.  Come ON!!  &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be good things that can come from the movement, but I would tread<br/>\nVERY carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura B.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Oh, and Cally, I agree with you wholeheartedly, btw.  That&#39;s what drew<br/>\nme so powerfully to unschooling -- it&#39;s demand that we see each child as a<br/>\nunique individual.<br/>\n<br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\n Date: Mon, 09 Aug 2004 07:59:16 +1200<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    From: Cally Brown &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjcmbrwn@...\">mjcmbrwn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: How is Waldorf education controlling?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any philosophy which denies the individuality of children is not a<br/>\n&gt; healthy one, IMO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But yes, I, and SOME of my children have also enjoyed many of the crafty<br/>\n&gt; ideas from waldorf, and thinking about some of their philosophy helped<br/>\n&gt; me organise my own philosophy about learning a bit more clearly - even,<br/>\n&gt; or maybe especially, the bits I disagreed with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cally<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127152010,"authorName":"Holly Furgason","from":"&quot;Holly Furgason&quot; &lt;unschooler@...&gt;","profile":"hollyfurgason","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How is Waldorf education controlling?","postDate":"1092035272","msgId":97508,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmNzdzOCtnaWMwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0MC4zMDRjMGQ3NS4yZTQ3MDI4MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":97507,"nextInTopic":97509,"prevInTime":97507,"nextInTime":97509,"topicId":97432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Music MUST be learned, but <br/>\nonly certain kinds of music, and in the right order.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs with all schools, the school itself becomes the most important organism, <br/>\nnot the children.
