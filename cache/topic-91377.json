They are only allowed out to play supervised by their own classroom teacher. Portables are a normal place for many of them to spend their whole day. So except for the bus ride even if there are 6 grades in a school they have absolutly no time to intermingle. The schools are so overcrowded that they don&#39;t have assemblies anymore, they don&#39;t even have performances put on by the whole school. Instead each grade level will have some sort of performance through out the year put on in conjuction with a PTA meeting. So say in October all the grade one classes will put on a program for the parents at the PTA meeting. This way they ensure a good turn out to the PTA meeting, since most of the grade one parents will come to see their children. Sneaky or Opportunist?Hmm.lol..<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the whole reason I took my kids out of school. The overcrowding and lack of any type of fun. Even before I knew anything about unschooling.

My local district is <br/>\nputting up a new jr high building this year - current plans are to move all the 7th <br/>\nand 8th graders in there next fall, and use the current building for 6th grade <br/>\nonly - 6th graders right now are in neighborhood schools with the 1st to 5th. <br/>\nA neighboring district has extremely age segregated schools - Kindergarten in <br/>\none place, 1st and 2nd in one cluster of buildings, 3rd and 4th in another, <br/>\n5th and 6th in yet another, 7th and 8th in a huge complex. These are huge <br/>\nschools - buildings of over a thousand kids all within two years of age of each <br/>\nother. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople look at me strangely when I describe these schools as a dangerous <br/>\nsocial experiment. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m being overly paranoid - I think that raising <br/>\nchildren in such unnatural circumstances is bound to have far reaching <br/>\nnegative effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":91454,"nextTopicId":91417}}
