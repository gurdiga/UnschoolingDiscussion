Then help me figure out what to do next. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But if I gave you my Certified Specialist recommendations they wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe true to unschooling... <br/>\n<br/>\nCacie wrote like that when she was reading at about the level you<br/>\ndescribed your daughter being at. I remember. Now she reads pretty much<br/>\neverything fluently and her spelling is more conventional, although not<br/>\nat &quot;third grade level&quot; according to the schools. I&#39;ve seen it evolve,<br/>\nthough. Her latest thing has been noticing that sometimes the  /w/ sound<br/>\nis spelled &quot;wh&quot;. She&#39;s overgeneralized the pattern, so she writes<br/>\n&quot;which&quot;, but also &quot;whith&quot;, &quot;whish&quot;, and she even threw in a few extra h&#39;s<br/>\nin words that started with s. She still asks me to spell words sometimes<br/>\n- for a while she would ask me to spell almost every word, I think mostly<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t want to go to the effort of sounding them out to spell<br/>\nthem. That was probably the stage she got to right after the stage where<br/>\nshe wrote like your daughter. My policy has always been to spell words<br/>\nshe asks me to spell for her, none of that &quot;What&#39;s the first sound you<br/>\nhear?&quot; or anything. I do think that helped, especially for her, because<br/>\nshe does do so much by sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also didn&#39;t do any &quot;encouraging&quot; Cacie to write to &quot;help her along&quot;, so<br/>\nshe has gone months without writing a word. Usually, when she starts<br/>\nwriting again after a dry spell her spelling will be improved from where<br/>\nshe left off, and she&#39;ll be incorporating some new punctuation marks (her<br/>\nlatest is putting apostrophe before every s, whether it&#39;s a plural or a<br/>\npossessive).  It is hard sometimes to wait... I loved writing when I was<br/>\na kid, I wrote a couple of 100+ page novels when I was a year older than<br/>\nshe is now. She tells great stories, she always has great ideas for books<br/>\nshe wants to write, but she&#39;s still frustrated by the mechanics. She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to dictate anymore... so she sometimes gets 2 or 3 sentences<br/>\ndown and that&#39;s it, but it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s her pace...<br/>\n<br/>\nI did write to this very list a few months ago when Cacie was feeling<br/>\nself-conscious about her spelling during a drama class. At the time, I<br/>\noffered to do something more formal if she wanted, maybe go through the<br/>\nDolch ( list and see which words she knew how to spell, and then pick<br/>\nthree a week or so and go over them and learn them... you could suggest<br/>\nthat, Cacie didn&#39;t take me up on it. The nice thing about that list is<br/>\nthat you can pretty much guanantee she&#39;ll know how to spell some of them<br/>\nalready, she seems to know &quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;mom&quot;, &quot;that&quot;... quite a<br/>\nfew. If you learn the first 50 or so it suddenly seems that you&#39;re<br/>\nspelling has vastly improved, because they are so common. Three a week<br/>\nsunded manageable... but Cacie didn&#39;t take me up on the offer, and she&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling better about writing now anyway....<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess really, I think what you should do next depends on what she does<br/>\nnext. I guess I think it would be easier to focus on small, doable things<br/>\nrather than huge things like &quot;reading better&quot; or &quot;spelling better&quot;.  If<br/>\nshe comes to you and is unahppy because she can&#39;t spell as well as she<br/>\nwants to, maybe you could look at what she&#39;s writing and say something<br/>\nlike, &quot;Well, did you know that the /ng/ sound at the end of a word is<br/>\nalways spelled &quot;ing&quot;? That&#39;s one you&#39;ll use a lot, and it doesn&#39;t really<br/>\nsound like those letters.&quot; Maybe that would help her to feel like she&#39;s<br/>\ngetting somewhere, because clearly she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

One thing I was thinking of doing with Lelia <br/>\nwas a mother/daughter journal, where we write back and forth to each other. <br/>\nShe is really interested in it. . . and its a way for her to see my writing <br/>\nstyle, words spelled correctly (hopefully most of them anyway), etc. Maybe <br/>\nyour daughter would be interested in that. And it wouldn&#39;t be like you were <br/>\ncorrecting her, but just sharing thoughts, ideas, or whatever you want to <br/>\nwith her.  I also was thinking maybe some of Shel Silverstein&#39;s books might <br/>\nbe cool for her to read, in particular we love &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;. . . no age <br/>\non it, but a cool book to read. And what about, reading books she is <br/>\ninterested in with her, and her reading a paragraph or however long she wants <br/>\nto read, and then you reading some and going back and forth like that. If she <br/>\nwants to learn but those Level Books aren&#39;t doing it for her, go on to <br/>\nsomething else. Does she like American Girl books? Lelia just skipped all <br/>\nthose level books.  But I am thinking finding books like that would be good. <br/>\nI don&#39;t guess she has a younger sibling, because I havent heard you mention <br/>\none, but Lelia loves to read to her little brother, and she enjoys the books <br/>\nhe has. Just throwing out ideas as they pop in my head. . . please dont feel <br/>\nyou have to respond or anything. . . just trying to be helpful :)<br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vIP1WgrU7Z7fYeEbIO4zbgt8jsBTZnyMcSbHlh8WRHVnzmMVK8DTftNeKXMO6WNmP01w3y8jNiHwAZ-2AAfjug","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1636","postDate":"1007082085","msgId":28999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDExMTMwMDEwOC5mQVUxOEZGVzAxNDk2N0BueWNzbXRwMm91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28994,"nextInTopic":29001,"prevInTime":28998,"nextInTime":29000,"topicId":28944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have<br/>\nsome theories, one is that most people have a preference for either<br/>\nlearning through phoentics primarily or learning through sight primarily<br/>\n(and then most seem to gather skills in the other appraoch through<br/>\nreading). I would talk about the differences, about how people who<br/>\nprocess information visually may be more comfortable with sight reading,<br/>\nand those who process aurally may prefer phonetics. We would discuss<br/>\nwhere this child seemed to be on this continuum.  Then, if he wanted to<br/>\nactually &#39;do&quot; something,  I would gather materials that I thought might<br/>\nhelp, maybe Teach Your Child to Read or Reading Reflex or Explode the<br/>\nCode for phonics, probably a collection of picture books and comic books<br/>\nfor sight words. We could go through the things he thought looked<br/>\ninteresting at the speed he wanted to do it, we could follow the &quot;rules&quot;<br/>\nin  book or not,  we could quit if he wanted to. One of the things Cacie<br/>\nwanted when she first started reading was for me to read a book to her -<br/>\nlongish books, like 50 or 60 page early reader chapter books  - and then<br/>\nshe would read them to herself. That was her process, that and Archies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen some families go this route, and the kids gain reading<br/>\nproficiency and eventually became fluent readers.

On the other hand, maybe that same professional would rake us over the coals for our unschooling lifestyle, consider it harmful to my child and............ well it&#39;s at this point that my imagination runs wild :(.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Joseph Fuerst <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 1:43 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1636<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s my dd&#39;s problem exactly... there&#39;s been no testing<br/>\n  and diagnosis of &quot;x&quot; disorder as I don&#39;t see why I should put her through<br/>\n  all that if we can help it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sarah:<br/>\n  I&#39;ve wondered if my dd has a LD, too;  but I won&#39;t have her &#39;tested&#39; and<br/>\n  diagnosed.....I have a nieghbor who&#39;s son is a ADHD...dx&#39;d at age 5 or so.<br/>\n  He&#39;s now 14 and I think the label has become a serious crutch...a serious<br/>\n  detriment to his ability to learn.
