I guess we don&#39;t<br/>\nhave the same population of slugs here where I live to cause any real<br/>\nproblem.  BTW, we&#39;re in southeast Tennessee.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not naive enough to think that even by being a vegetarian, I&#39;m not<br/>\nkilling.  I know MUCH better than that.

My husband, also, is not a &quot;veg-head&quot;.  So, in<br/>\nshort, the ethical choices we face daily are infinite.  We all have to do<br/>\nwhat we personally think is best.  : )<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for sharing.  Even though I still think that slugs and snails<br/>\nare beautiful creatures and won&#39;t kill ours, I&#39;m thankful that we don&#39;t have<br/>\nthe population problem that you guys must have on the west coast.  Just<br/>\nhoping that you will try to kill them as humanely as possible...quick deaths<br/>\nif possible.  I like the stepping on them with the shoe idea for the<br/>\nquickest route...just make sure that they&#39;re really dead and not just dying<br/>\nwhen you leave them?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14786,"nextTopicId":14789}}
