I don&#39;t suggest they do a chore with me, I had that done to me as a child and hated it.<br/>\nI see boredom as a restlessness. It&#39;s a feeling of having too much time on your hands and needing new input....why wouldn&#39;t I use that as an opportunity to find something fun?<br/>\nSo like others here, we have an idea list. <br/>\nIt&#39;s also a rare occasion that anyone even uses the word &quot;bored&quot; around here..their lives are pretty happy and interesting these days...but I didn&#39;t have a bunch of school to undo either.<br/>\nTrevor is the one that will sometimes get bored, he&#39;s 14 and a bit restless. Computers take up most of his down time now, so it doesn&#39;t leave much room for restlessness.:)<br/>\nHe came to me and said &quot;I&#39;m bored out of my skull&quot; last week. He was in a &quot;stuck&quot; place. He couldn&#39;t get his new computer components up and running, he didn&#39;t feel like video gaming and the rest of us were happy being at home.<br/>\nI told him I was willing to help find something projectish in a few minutes, and I handed him our &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; book, since he&#39;s been MAJOR into technology and the workings of computers and other inventions. He disappeared into his room and I didn&#39;t hear a thing for about 1/2 hour...then he shouts &quot;MOM, this book is SO cool, thanks for getting it out for me&quot;...then he&#39;s in the cave for about another 1/2 hour reading, finally emerging to get online and look up more stuff at the &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; website.<br/>\nIt&#39;s been an entire week of learning about magnetic ram and DNA micro-processors, which completely fascinate him (technology not perfected or available to the public yet), all from a moment of boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of being a creative soul is having down time...times when you seem to be doing nothing, time to assimilate all that you&#39;ve learned or created or thought about. Then you hit a spree of activity usually, a spurt when the ideas and learning seem to swirl about and flow like a river. Those down times are hugely important. I think boredom can be part of that time, and it might just be that time when the ideas and flow are about to start again. So go with it!! Jump in and offer new ideas, projects, outings, cool movies or books, maybe even a party. Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;There is no way to <br/>\npeace.  Peace is the way.&quot; <br/>\n                   ~Quaker saying</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117369878,"authorName":"Kelli Traaseth","from":"Kelli Traaseth &lt;kellitraas@...&gt;","profile":"kellitraas","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] boredom","postDate":"1042003355","msgId":53741,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTA4MDUyMjM1Ljg4OTY1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwMTA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBNDExRTA2LjFBNzglYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":53735,"nextInTopic":93878,"prevInTime":53740,"nextInTime":53742,"topicId":16699,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I always got from my mom,   well,  you can clean your room,  clean the guinea pigs cage,  dust, vacuum,   hmmmmm,   sounds fun to me!
