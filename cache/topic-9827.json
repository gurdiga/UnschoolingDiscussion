It also is <br/>\nconfirming my conviction that Unschool really is magical. Being patient, and not <br/>\npushing, and letting them find their way by their heart.....amazing.  Not that I <br/>\ndo that now.....I&#39;m still trying to deschool myself...but it is my final <br/>\ngoal.  Just to relax, and know everything is going to be okay. To realize, these <br/>\nincredible boys of mine, have incredible dreams in their heads, and to allow <br/>\nthem to follow that, is the greatest gift of all. Anyway, continue talking about <br/>\nthe doables, and the styles and ideas of homeschool....and overweight <br/>\nchildren &lt;I&#39;m trying to relax on that one, too&gt; and our dreams....... it&#39;s good to be <br/>\nin a real world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks~<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\np.s.

Sometimes it is. I guess I can only be who I <br/>\nam at any given moment. If I have hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, I do apologize. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it has been my intention to do so, but possibly I speak without <br/>\nreally thinking about the effect of my words sometimes. I do not apologize <br/>\nfor stating my beliefs about various things . . . that would be very contrary <br/>\nto who I am as an unschooler and just as a human be-ing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not always agree with Sandra, and have no probelm saying so, but I like <br/>\nmost others, really respect her and what she has to say about unschooling. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like the quibbling either, and sometimes I get sucked right down into <br/>\nit.  I do believe that most of the time Sandra stays focused on ideas and <br/>\nunschooling. . . probably 99 percent of the time. Anyway, I didn&#39;t mean this <br/>\nto be a focus on her, but rather on my part in it all. I think I get caught <br/>\nup in trying to get others to &quot;see&quot; how they are interacting in the whole <br/>\ndrama/situation. . . it really is not my job though. It is a mirror to me <br/>\nthough and it shows me something I need to work on, which is really all <br/>\nanyone can do. . . stop focusing on others and focus on the work within. <br/>\n<br/>\nlovemary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall","from":"&quot;Nanci and Thomas Kuykendall&quot; &lt;tn-k4of5@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0d6VuaJEhX7rn80gevLDGOfsMmo17OdoiFrekJsvB6DO9hQ-rO69ppOKojpMV20032cFzhbw8yjj4XO5bvUm07MFcbnJXmo0eZcASZBnSeNmKIDSymaAdhiHoXpkHQ","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[Unschooling-dotcom] This List","postDate":"987273601","msgId":18660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDEwNDE0MTg0MC5MQUEyMDgxOUBtYWlsMS5iaWdtYWlsYm94LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":18653,"nextInTopic":28402,"prevInTime":18659,"nextInTime":18661,"topicId":9827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
