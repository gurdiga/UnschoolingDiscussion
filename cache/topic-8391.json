I couldn&#39;t find a<br/>\nwebsite for it so far; none is listed in the magazine. There is only a<br/>\nnon-toll free phone number. Everything provided on the back cover is listed<br/>\nbelow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKids Discover  (published monthly, 10 issues a year)<br/>\n149 Fifth Avenue<br/>\nNew York, NY  10010<br/>\n(212) 677-4457<br/>\n<br/>\nSend subscriptions to:<br/>\nKids Discover<br/>\nP.O. Box 54205<br/>\nBoulder, CO 80328-4205<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a card in the magazine for a one year, 10-issue subscription for<br/>\n$19.95. The regular price is $26.95 per year. I also saw some magazine<br/>\nservices online that have it for $19.95, but I have never purchased<br/>\nanything from them. Also, there are no advertisements in the magazine,<br/>\nwhich is unusual and very nice!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlivia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8381,"nextTopicId":8346}}
