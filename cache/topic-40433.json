I&#39;ve often thought of writing an article called <br/>\n&quot;Garfield Taught My Son To Read&quot;. Truly. Between going through all our old <br/>\nbaby/kid books and reading his favorite comics, Conor became a reader. (That <br/>\nand a desperate desire to read Harry Potter on his own.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as easy-ish yet interesting books, have you tried the Magic Treehouse <br/>\nseries? Casey loves those. She also likes Nate the Great and anything with a <br/>\nbit of a mystery in it. Conor liked The Zach Files.<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is good.<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mobile.msn.com\">http://mobile.msn.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40383,"nextTopicId":40328}}
