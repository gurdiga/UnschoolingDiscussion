You come on here talking about peaceful parenting<br/>\nor  <br/>\nwhatever it was you were going on and on about and then go and do <br/>\nthat? From what I saw, Sandra was not even on list for a while, why <br/>\nattack her personally? Why single her out? Are you jealous? <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have been short and flippy with me but to go on a public <br/>\nunschooling list and talk about someone like that is just so immature.<br/>\nSandra may be short when she is tired of hearing something over and <br/>\nover, sometimes I agree, sometimes I don&#39;t BUT I have a lot of<br/>\nrespect for her and all that she does to help parents and children. <br/>\nShe isone person on this list that you can count on to help if you<br/>\nare <br/>\nhaving a problem unschooling or even life in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just for the record, you made a complete ass out of yourself on <br/>\nRUL. Someone posted there last week about not liking Sandra and some <br/>\nguy on the list stuck up for Sandra and the conversation dropped. So <br/>\nthere seems to be more on that list that care for Sandra than dislike <br/>\nor maybe they weren&#39;t up to playing gossip games, I don&#39;t know. Seems <br/>\nto me that you have a problem and maybe you should keep it to <br/>\nyourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77417,"nextTopicId":76848}}
