Please understand that this group is not the <br/>\nstandard, all inclusive type, that a lot of Yahoo groups tend to be. Rather, this is a <br/>\ngroup of ecclectic thinkers, people who can&#39;t stand thinking inside the box <br/>\nand more than anything put their children above and beyond everything else that <br/>\nexists. Some people have always unschooled, some have found it later than <br/>\nthey would have liked, but were just glad to find that such a way of life exists <br/>\noutside their own homes. It is not just about school though. Rather it is <br/>\nabout living life and the knowledge one gains by enjoying that life. All of us <br/>\nhave different points of view, but what you must understand about this group is <br/>\nthat whatever topic you choose to post, you WILL get feedback and often the <br/>\noutlooks will vary. My only caution to you is to not take what responses you get <br/>\nas personal attacks. More often than not, when we are defensive, it is because <br/>\none side or the other is not fully comprehending what is being pointed out at <br/>\nthe request of the original poster. Being unschoolers is hard enough to <br/>\nexplain to other homeschoolers, the last thing anyone here wants to do is argue our <br/>\nchoices. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the whole ADHD/ADD argument, I am well versed but frankly not in the <br/>\nmood for it this afternoon. That does not mean that I will not be responding it <br/>\nsimply means I will contemplate my response if I choose to end up talking <br/>\nabout the condition. The saddest thing about this as a condition is that so often <br/>\neven the &quot;experts&quot; are wrong. Sadly I think far too many parents take the <br/>\neasy road out by going the drug route, just because some expert says so. Then <br/>\nthere are kids who are misdiagnosed completely from day one, are then put on drug <br/>\ntherapies that don&#39;t work and these kids are tossed to the side as not being <br/>\nworthy of education.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda - who is stopping because she&#39;s gonna start rambling without <br/>\ncomtemplation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117212306,"authorName":"Christina M Ledford","from":"Christina M Ledford &lt;christina989@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Praising Our Kids - Punished by Rewards II","postDate":"1054848954","msgId":72381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjA1LjE3MzU1NC43NzE2LjExLmNocmlzdGluYTk4OUBqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72368,"nextInTopic":72387,"prevInTime":72380,"nextInTime":72382,"topicId":72368,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with you wholeheartedly.

This is basically the message I was<br/>\ntrying to get across but ended up every which way but loose...<br/>\nI do have a concern, however, when it comes to my 5-yo grandson who was<br/>\ndiagnosed with ADHD.  Now, I know I&#39;m going to raise some antennae, but<br/>\nlet me just say here and now that I know how often this blanket diagnosis<br/>\nis applied to kids -- the school system tried to apply it to my son<br/>\nJames.  I wasn&#39;t about to buy into it one bit, but even though I trusted<br/>\nmy own experiences with James, I felt it couldn&#39;t hurt to check it out<br/>\nwith my brother who is the area&#39;s acknowledged expert on ADHD.  Anyway,<br/>\nmy grandson&#39;s behavior was something different entirely.  He was most<br/>\ndefinitely out of control -- unable to settle himself down, particularly<br/>\nin &quot;stimuating&quot; environments -- preschool being one of them.  He was<br/>\nliterally bouncing off walls.  As adamantly opposed as I am to meds for<br/>\nkids, I, of course, had to accept my daughter&#39;s decision to at least try<br/>\nmedication.  The difference is amazing.  This child can now sit and<br/>\ncolor, can play Legos, etc., activities he couldn&#39;t engage in before for<br/>\nmore than a few minutes at best.  He notices how he feels &quot;different&quot;<br/>\nnow.  He&#39;s not drugged out, his personality is unchanged, etc.; he&#39;s just<br/>\ncalmer and is able to focus.  In my grandson&#39;s case, my daughter has been<br/>\nencouraged to use behavior mod (not with food, of course) -- praising him<br/>\nwhenever he&#39;s focused, etc., since as effective as the medication might<br/>\nbe, nothing really happens long-term without &quot;training&quot; the brain..  But,<br/>\nI&#39;m not the expert, and although, as I mentioned, my brother is, I&#39;m more<br/>\ncomfortable hearing about people&#39;s own personal experiences with this<br/>\nissue.  If I&#39;m forgiven, may I have some feedback on the ADHD issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina<br/>\nOn Thu, 05 Jun 2003 12:49:19 -0700 <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tmthomas@...\">tmthomas@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; T&#39;was I that suggested the book.
