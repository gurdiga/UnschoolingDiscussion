I hear<br/>\npeople with small children say this a lot.  I see people with small<br/>\nchildren, who are very loving, gentle parents be unable to talk for 2<br/>\nminutes about an issue that needs to be talked about because their children<br/>\nrefuse to give them that space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have several small children.  I know how they have difficulty waiting for<br/>\neven 5 seconds to tell you things...but I also know that sometimes adults<br/>\nmust talk together about things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our house, I call dh at work during his lunch hour and we catch up or<br/>\ntalk about the logistics of things.  Other times, I tell the kids that Dad<br/>\nand I need a couple of minutes alone because we have to sort out a problem<br/>\nand we go in our bedroom.  We make sure to keep it brief and it is rarely a<br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do other families handle this?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Jennifer Altenbach&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salten@...\">salten@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, May 12, 2004 8:29 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] new with question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Ren wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;If you could find a homeschooled teen, or a young college student,<br/>\n&gt; that might possibly be your best bet.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good advice, Ren, thanks!
