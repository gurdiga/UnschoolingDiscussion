Money is <br/>\nvery mismanaged by most schools. When we lived in Anchorage they <br/>\ntried to institute a registration fee of around $50 or $60 per student<br/>\n(it has been almost 5 years since we left there. I don&#39;t remember the <br/>\nexact amount). The administrators promised that the money from this <br/>\nfee would go directly to the classroom teacher of the student it was <br/>\npaid for so that teacher would have more money for classroom <br/>\nsupplies. Well, in jr high and sr high kids have several teachers, so <br/>\nthat money wouldn&#39;t have gone far. I had kids in both elementary and <br/>\njr high at the time. I asked the teachers of all of my kids if the <br/>\nextra money was helping. Each and every one of them said that they <br/>\nnever saw a penny of that extra money. One parent went to court to <br/>\nfight the fee and won since public education is supposed to <br/>\nbe &quot;free&quot;. The schools still charged it, but they were supposed to <br/>\ntell you that it was optional...they didn&#39;t. When I registered my <br/>\ndaughter for jr high, they were telling everyone that they couldn&#39;t <br/>\nget their child&#39;s schedule until the fee was paid, (unless you were <br/>\non the reduced lunch program.go figure!). Only if you refused to pay, <br/>\ndid they say it was optional. But you had to go to the principal and <br/>\nget a waiver before they would let you get the schedule, even if you <br/>\nwere on the reduced lunch program. And the principal would give you a <br/>\nhard time about it, even if you were on the reduced lunch program. So <br/>\nthe parents who didn&#39;t have the guts or the knowledge to speak up, <br/>\nwound up paying the fee; which wasn&#39;t even going where the <br/>\nadministrators promised. I was one of the few parents who had the <br/>\nguts to speak up when I registered my daughter. Even though we were <br/>\non the reduced lunch program, I told the principal that I wanted a <br/>\nwaiver but not the one that said I wasn&#39;t paying due to the fact of <br/>\nbeing on that program. I wanted a waiver that simply said that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to pay because the &quot;fee&quot; was optional. The principals of <br/>\nboth schools my kids were attending gave me the waiver, but only <br/>\nafter giving me a hard time about it. When schools get more money, it <br/>\nis usually wasted. That has been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Suzanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: NEA vs homeschooling","postDate":"1028900215","msgId":40393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzLjFhYjhjODA5LjJhODUxZjc3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40403,"prevInTime":40392,"nextInTime":40394,"topicId":40393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/8/02 11:23:29 PM, leschke@islandnet.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1236338666\">In a message dated 8/8/02 11:23:29 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; But my point was that superintendents are *not* the NEA.
