We already know that students enjoy speculating<br/>\nabout what happened to the dinosaurs, pondering the shape of the<br/>\nuniverse or imagining the Big Bang. We think that they can get as much<br/>\nintriguing puzzlement from wondering about the size of infinity and<br/>\nfinding out that there are some very simple-sounding problems that would<br/>\ntake huge computers longer than the estimated age of the universe to<br/>\nsolve. We are concerned that so much of the ``good stuff&#39;&#39; doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nit&#39;s way into the math classrooms until graduate school.   -mike<br/>\nfellows; mega- math<br/>\n<br/>\n-susan<br/>\naustin,tx</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5397,"nextTopicId":5400}}
