I think it is good for children to <br/>\nsee parents learn and change who they are and how they feel about themselves. <br/>\n It shows that you are not perfect and that you are willing to put in the <br/>\ntime and effort it takes to change.  Your children will respect you for that. <br/>\n They will see that it is possible to work out those kinds of problems.  They <br/>\nwill learn that if they are ever faced with challenges that seem <br/>\ninsurmountable there is a way.  They will see the resources you use.  You <br/>\nwill talk to your children about the journey.  They see you in a new light.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be a model of self motivation you need to find your passion or interest.  <br/>\nAnd follow it.  Read about it, seek out people who do it, go places where <br/>\n&quot;it&quot; is.  One of my passions is quilting.  My boys see me doing it.  They see <br/>\nme researching and picking out fabrics.  They get involved.  They help me.  I <br/>\nask their advice. They see how excited I am when it all comes together.
