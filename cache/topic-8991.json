I got one<br/>\nmailed to me last year, but don&#39;t remember where I called. Also, do we have<br/>\nto actually write down that we have school for 6 or 7 hours a day? It bugs<br/>\nme to even have to say that, since she&#39;ll only be a first grader.

If you need to feed it a little rolled oats <br/>\nis a good food to start it on.
