It&#39;s not<br/>\nthat they did high school differently; it&#39;s that they simply didn&#39;t do<br/>\nit.  Beyond the basics, I&#39;m not convinced that there&#39;s an list of<br/>\nessential subjects that students must study before college.  I am<br/>\nconvinced that what&#39;s foundational are personal characteristics.  The<br/>\nlist of college readiness traits that appear to me to be most important<br/>\nare confidence, curiosity, enthusiasm, capacity for wholehearted<br/>\nengagement, ability to persevere, realistic self-knowledge, and a sense<br/>\nof autonomy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s just one of many stories I can relate:  \t<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex spent his “high school” years living on the streets,<br/>\ntraveling, working as a staff reporter for Pacific News Service, and<br/>\nreading.  He was briefly confined at Juvenile Hall, and while there he<br/>\nmade the contact that led to his job as a reporter.  Pacific News<br/>\nService sent Alex on a trip to Western Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.<br/>\nHe says, “The most important part of this trip...was my visit to<br/>\nSarajevo and my reporting project in Kosovo.  This gave me a new<br/>\nunderstanding of a region so important to international relations and<br/>\nadded a new focus to my writing career.  I saw such intense stories in a<br/>\nregion torn apart by war and realized that wartime reporting was the<br/>\nfocus that I wanted to take.”<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex wants to earn a Ph.D. in political science and chose Columbia<br/>\nUniversity as his first-choice school.  He applied and was rejected, but<br/>\nhe was also encouraged to complete some coursework and apply again.  He<br/>\nattended a full year of classes as a non-matriculated student at UC<br/>\nBerkeley, re-applied, and was accepted.  He was also accepted by Reed<br/>\nCollege.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex began his studies at Columbia in the fall of 2002.  He had gained<br/>\nadmission without any credit––zero––for high-school-level studies; his<br/>\ncoursework at Berkeley included no science, and in math he completed<br/>\njust a one-unit refresher course in algebra and trigonometry and a<br/>\nclass in statistics.  The reading he did while on the streets was <br/>\nmostly in<br/>\npolitical science, international affairs, history, philosophy, and <br/>\neconomics, and his<br/>\nfocus at Berkeley was in these areas also.<br/>\n<br/>\nWes</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":94004,"nextTopicId":93793}}
