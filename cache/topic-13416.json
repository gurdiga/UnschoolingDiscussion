I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-14616845\">Thanks to everyone for the great advice and support. I think keeping a <br/>\njournal daily to help me realize how much learning is really going on is a <br/>\ngreat idea. I am really looking forward to being part of this wonderful <br/>\ncommunication web. Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I began questioning vaccinations when they began giving newborn babies <br/>\nthe Hepatitis B vaccine. When I questioned the nurse on this her reply was, <br/>\n&quot;We need to start protecting our children now so that when they become <br/>\nteenagers and begin to act irresponsibly they will be protected.&quot; I found <br/>\nthis insane since it is only transferred by blood or sexual contact. <br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it seem to make more sense to have faith in our children and our <br/>\nguidance as parents to teach them about risks and moral responsibility? <br/>\nThere is also no long term safety tests on this vaccine. I felt it made no <br/>\nsense to put this into my beautiful newborn babies body whose only defense <br/>\nwas the antibodies from my milk. None of my children are vaccinated.<br/>\n<br/>\n      Check out this sit if you get a chance: <br/>\nwww.nextcity.com/contents/summer99/16shots.html It is a great article on the <br/>\nhistory of vaccinations.<br/>\n<br/>\n          If anyone has a son or daughter looking for a penpal, my sons <br/>\nwould greatly appreciate it.
