I can see I really need to talk to some<br/>\nbreeders.<br/>\n You are right...we got him at a pet shop. we were told they were no<br/>\ndifferent than breeders just less expensive.hmmmm!  I can see that we<br/>\nwill want to pay for quality.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood breeders, those who breed for the love of the species, do so for<br/>\ntemperament foremost.  I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories where someone got a<br/>\nreal gem at the local pet store but it&#39;s a chancier endeavor.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Do any breeders ship? and is it an arm and a leg? what price might we<br/>\nbe talking for two rats? I don&#39;t know the different breeds so I can&#39;t say<br/>\nI am particular. I go more for the personality......I guess except when I<br/>\ngo to the pet store huh? LOL!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost good breeders do not ship, it&#39;s hard on the ratties and it&#39;s WAY<br/>\nexpensive if they do.  If you do some research you&#39;re sure to find a<br/>\nrattery near you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as &quot;breeds&quot; it&#39;s really more a matter of color, hair type and<br/>\nears.  They are basically the same except that the breeders have helped<br/>\nto single out the ones with good temperament.  The differences are<br/>\ngenetic mutations and if they are not responsibly bred it can mean<br/>\nproducing poor little ratties with severe health problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are curly haired rats called &quot;rex&quot;, if you double the genetic trait<br/>\nyou get a &quot;hairless&quot; rat.  There are tailless rats but breeders don&#39;t<br/>\nrecommend letting the females breed since the mutation can also mean a<br/>\nlack of the muscles needed to give birth.  We have decided that we want<br/>\n&quot;dumbos&quot; the next time, their ears are located a bit farther down the<br/>\nsides of their heads.  This gives them a very cute appearance and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to affect them adversely health wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris  (who&#39;s daughter is avidly researching rat breeding)<br/>\n\r<br/>\n________________________________________________________________\r<br/>\nSign Up for Juno Platinum Internet Access Today\r<br/>\nOnly $9.95 per month!\r<br/>\nVisit www.juno.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47742,"nextTopicId":47841}}
