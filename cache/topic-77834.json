I have wanted to move to BC<br/>\nsince I went there in oooh &#39;91.  Our big problem is debt , me not working,<br/>\nand my husbands lack of a degree.  He&#39;s amazingly smart and learns quickly<br/>\nand has a few years in University.  But with four kids and homeschooling we<br/>\ncan&#39;t see getting him back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love every bit of BC that I&#39;ve seen.  Lived in Kamloops for 8 months.  I<br/>\nreally would just like to have the view and the air.  It was so soul<br/>\nrefreshing to stand on my balcony in Kamloops half way up the mountain and<br/>\nlook down and around the valley.  I would feel the stress melt away it was<br/>\namazing.  If you could just put that in a bottle and send me some on a<br/>\nregular basis that would be splendid. 8-D  I have heard that parts of the<br/>\nmainland are very heavily sprayed Penticton-Okanogan areas specifically is<br/>\nthe Nelson area as bad?  It&#39;s too late for me to try and articulate what I<br/>\nwant any ideas or what ever are appreciated.
