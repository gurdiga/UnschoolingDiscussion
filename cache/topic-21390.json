As my health has deteriorated over the last<br/>\ncouple of years, I have worried some about his opportunities to get to know<br/>\npeople.  You know what?  He is quite friendly and outgoing.  Waves at people<br/>\nas we are driving by.  Converses with anyone we meet at the store or other<br/>\noutings, etc.  Lack of social skills is NOT a problem!  He is a charming and<br/>\npolite boy.  (So far...shhh...13 is just around the corner!  &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends and other relationships will develop from your normal every day<br/>\nroutines...whatever that is!  In your examples, you (and your DD) will get<br/>\nto know others at story time or at the park and make friends or at least<br/>\npassing acquaintances.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my DS was younger, he actually met and made a great pal in the line<br/>\nwaiting to buy stamps at the post office!  He and another boy about his age<br/>\nhit it off so well that his mother and I made arrangements to meet again for<br/>\na play date and things went from there.  Turned out to be a good experience.<br/>\nWhat has surprised me over the years is that this was not the only time<br/>\nsomething like this happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat thrills me is to watch DS as he interacts with adults or older youth.<br/>\nIt is wonderful to see that he is able to follow the conversation about many<br/>\nvaried topics.  He knows how to express interest in subjects other people<br/>\nwant to share with him and he knows how to share his interests with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing &#39;isolated&#39; has not hurt him.  It has influenced the type of people he<br/>\nhas interactions with (he may know more about hospitals, doctors, physical<br/>\ntherapists, chiropractors, or other medical specialties than most boys his<br/>\nage, for instance).

It is at<br/>\nmy website and called &quot;should you home school shy children&quot; if you want to<br/>\nread it.  What it pretty much boiled down to for me, is that children do not<br/>\nbecome less shy when they are left in a room full of people.  They need to<br/>\nlearn confidence first where they feel safe and then they will feel like<br/>\nthey can open up more with new people.  Putting shy children into the school<br/>\nsituation often makes them draw more into themselves because they don&#39;t feel<br/>\ncomfortable.  Don&#39;t send them to school for this reason.  :0(<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many opportunities for socializing if you look around.  You will<br/>\nprobably find a whole bunch of people home schooling right near you if you<br/>\nfind someone to connect you to them.  They are like the underground<br/>\nrailroad.

I got great grades.  I learned how to<br/>\ntake tests and was very good at it.  I retained only the stuff that<br/>\ninterested me which is what you children will do whether they go to school<br/>\nor are schooled at home.  Unschooling is following their interests so they<br/>\nhave the greatest chance to retain what they learn as it all interests them.<br/>\nAlso, It took me over ten years to get back my self esteem that was lost in<br/>\nschool. It isn&#39;t on my report card, but it is part of me.  I hated all the<br/>\nfakeness.  I never felt comfortable being anyone but myself and so I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfit in very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy go against the norm&quot; &quot;you do not have a teaching degree, how far do<br/>\nyou think you teach them, if you do not know all the subjects?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, if you went to school you should be able to teach them everything you<br/>\nlearned  :0)  Of course if you didn&#39;t retain it then why are you even<br/>\nworried about teaching it to your kids.  What did you learn in school that<br/>\nyou use every day still?  Could you have learned it another way?  How much<br/>\ndid you forget and does that effect your life now?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>\nworried about college?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids want to go to college, they can find a way.

I&#39;ve never really been a &quot;stand<br/>\nup and speak for yourself&quot; type person, always been in the background just<br/>\nlistening to what everyone says and takes the good & bad with all information<br/>\nand sortof just does what it is I really think will work. But this is not just<br/>\nmy life that I am affecting, its my dh&#39;s and my dd&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n|--------+------------------------&gt;<br/>\n|        |          diamondair@ema|<br/>\n|        |          il.msn.com    |<br/>\n|        |                        |<br/>\n|        |          05/18/2001    |<br/>\n|        |          10:44 AM      |<br/>\n|        |          Please respond|<br/>\n|        |          to            |<br/>\n|        |          Unschooling-do|<br/>\n|        |          tcom          |<br/>\n|        |                        |<br/>\n|--------+------------------------&gt;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;---------------------------------------------------------|<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  |                                                         |<br/>\n  |       To:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>        |<br/>\n  |       cc:     (bcc: Tammy Graves/DF/HCIA)               |<br/>\n  |       Subject:     [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: First grade |<br/>\n  |       (was I&#39;ve Had Enough)                             |<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;---------------------------------------------------------|<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My oldest (6) is really looking forward to going to ps for first<br/>\n </span></blockquote>grade.

By<br/>\nthat time, the damage is done. Personally, I&#39;d avoid the poison and<br/>\nI&#39;d avoid public school. I think it poisons children&#39;s minds with the<br/>\nconcepts that they need someone else to teach them in order to learn,<br/>\nthat adults can and should control every aspect of their lives, that<br/>\nwhat 30 other children their own age think about their clothes<br/>\nmatters more than anything else in the world, that what those in<br/>\nauthority say about an issue is the definitive word, and many more<br/>\nthings that I really don&#39;t want my kids to learn. If I ever started<br/>\nhaving doubts as to whether or not I should send my kid to PS, I<br/>\nwould go back and read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Six-Lesson Schoolteacher&quot;<br/>\nagain and again until I stopped :-)  (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html\">http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason kids look forward to going to public school is the<br/>\noverwhelming propaganda and cultural machine that makes sure kids get<br/>\nexcited about it. Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her<br/>\nspecific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school.<br/>\nMore time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn?<br/>\nRiding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange<br/>\nfor her without also burdening her with school.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each<br/>\nchild is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for<br/>\nmy children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) inventor of new and wonderful things<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) singer of protest songs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers\">http://www.geocities.com/the_clevengers</a>   Flying Clevenger Family<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\nCheck it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe, set preferences, or read archives:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother great list sponsored by Home Education Magazine!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.home-ed-magazine.com\">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!
