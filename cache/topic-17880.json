If mortgage is such a problem,<br/>\nis there any way you can move to a less expensive area? Our move last year<br/>\ntook us from an area where houses were about $400,000 to one where you can<br/>\nget a house for $100,000. Making such a move can reduce drastically or even<br/>\neliminate a mortgage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest, who will be in 1st grade this Sept<br/>\n&gt; will probably have to go to public school until my husband and I<br/>\n&gt; really know that she is not enjoying it and/or learning something.

Personally, I believe that school is demoralizing, debilitating,<br/>\nand destroys a child&#39;s ability to learn on their own - even for kids who<br/>\nexcel at it. It takes a lot of time to &quot;deschool&quot; (as many parents on this<br/>\nlist can attest) and so if you can avoid going through this, I would do so.<br/>\nIf you can&#39;t work it out to have one parent at home, are there any charter<br/>\nschools in your area? Perhaps you have an option for a Waldorf or other<br/>\nschool that will have less of a negative impact than a traditional public<br/>\nschool? I realize that I come from a pretty radical bent, but I do think it<br/>\nis worth not brushing this issue off, but instead giving it some serious<br/>\nthought and brainstorming to see if you can come up with a better solution.<br/>\nPerhaps you could share a nanny or tutor with other families for the hours<br/>\nthat you are not able to have a parent at home? There&#39;s a homeschooling<br/>\nfamily I know who does this - both parents work different shifts but they<br/>\nhave a few hours a day where they are both gone and they do a nanny share.<br/>\nJust some ideas to pursue..<br/>\n<br/>\n Blue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nMom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;My pants are outgrowing me&quot;<br/>\nand Asa (10/5/99) &quot;Potty pee!

My husband does get insurance from <br/>\nhis employer but we have to pay for a large part of it.

A <br/>\nfun day at the park thrills them and so does homemade playdough. But as our <br/>\nchildren got older there were many things they wanted to do, classes they <br/>\nwanted to take, hobbies they wanted to pursue. It got tiresome to always say, <br/>\nwe cannot afford it. So I began selling items on ebay and it has made a <br/>\ndifference. I am not getting rich but it has given us extra money to pay off <br/>\nthose bills and go to karate classes and etc. I have a friend who needed more <br/>\nincome too so she got a weekend job. May not seem like the greatest idea <br/>\nsince it takes away from family togetherness time but at least there is <br/>\nalways her or her husband home with the kids and they can continue to <br/>\nhomeschool. I know another homeschooler here who has a job every afternoon <br/>\nand the kids go with her. Could you switch to just part time? I have a <br/>\nneighbor who does country type crafts and makes a nice amount of extra money <br/>\nat craft fairs. (personally I hate making crafts). Figure up how much money <br/>\nyou need to pay the bills and shoot to make that amount. If you are home and <br/>\nwilling you can save a lot of money. Baby-sitting expense for one.
