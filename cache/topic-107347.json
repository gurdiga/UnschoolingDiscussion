I think that&#39;s why it took so long for me to <br/>\nfigure out what was going on.  I just kept thinking that if I <br/>\ntreated her with an unschool attitude that she would have a vacation <br/>\nfrom being forced to do things and she would come around.  There <br/>\nwere a few moments like that but I think what it boiled down to was <br/>\nthat she wanted her parents to listen to her and she wanted them to <br/>\nwant her at home.  That&#39;s my guess.<br/>\n <br/>\nA few &quot;good&quot; examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left her with Sarah for a morning and it was really getting hot <br/>\noutside and we had the back door open.  Before I left I told her <br/>\nthat if they got hot they could close the door and turn the air <br/>\nconditioner on.  I showed her where the thermostat was and told her <br/>\nto make herself comfortable--whatever temp that might be.  She <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Wow, at my house only my Dad gets to touch the thermostat.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we subscribe to Netflix and Noelle wants a subscription but <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have one.  I told her to go on mine and pick out whatever <br/>\nshe wanted for the next movie.  She told me she had it narrowed down <br/>\nto three and told me what they were--I think she expected me to tell <br/>\nher she couldn&#39;t watch them.  I said, well, whatever you want and <br/>\nshe chose &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and got it and watched it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were good moments but I was overwhelmed by her comments and <br/>\ncoercive energy by the 7th day.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Part 3:  Saga of Schooled Teen Niece","postDate":"1121776926","msgId":107348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlLjZjYjQzMDQ3LjMwMGU0ZjFlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":107347,"nextInTopic":107349,"prevInTime":107347,"nextInTime":107349,"topicId":107347,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/19/2005 7:37:55 AM Central Standard Time, maggioncalda@cox.net writes: Noelle  was sobbing and she said, You think that I think you re a ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1223959587\">In a message dated 7/19/2005 7:37:55 AM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maggioncalda@...\">maggioncalda@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle  was sobbing and she said, &quot;You think that I think you&#39;re a <br/>\nbad  mother.

This is <br/>\nhelping me tremendously to write about it and try to be objective--<br/>\nalthough I fail!)  During Noelle&#39;s visit I sometimes felt like an <br/>\nobserver watching school vs. unschool, distrust vs. trust, no choice <br/>\nvs. choice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I told Noelle she needed to go home our conversation continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  You&#39;re the one who wanted me to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: Wait a minute.  You&#39;re Mom set this up and she said you wanted <br/>\nto come.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  I didn&#39;t want to come and I told my parents that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  You told them you didn&#39;t want to come and they made you anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  Yes, I told them I didn&#39;t want to come and they said I had <br/>\nto.  Then I asked if I could come for only a week and they said no <br/>\nto that, too.  When my Dad called on Sunday I asked if I could come <br/>\nhome and they said no.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note:  During the 10 days that Noelle was with us.  Her Dad called <br/>\nher once and her mother not at all.  Even after she told them she <br/>\nwas miserable and wanted to come home nobody bothered to tell me or <br/>\nmy husband and they also didn&#39;t call to check on her.  I am still <br/>\nsaddened and amazed by this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  Well, I will call them and we will get you home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  They won&#39;t let me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  They will have no choice.  I can make that happen for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  No, I&#39;ll get in trouble for stressing you out.  I can&#39;t be <br/>\nstressing you out that much.  (I know you can&#39;t read tone or emotion <br/>\nin these words but if you can imagine a 14 year old girl in tears <br/>\nand yelling in a panicky voice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  I won&#39;t make it about me it will be about you.  I&#39;ll tell them <br/>\nyou&#39;re unhappy here and you want to come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  That won&#39;t work with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  What do you want me to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle:  I don&#39;t know what I want.  (She runs upstairs to her room.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was shocked and sad and confused and I felt tremendous sympathy <br/>\nfor this poor child who had no choice and was trying to get what she <br/>\nneeded--which was to go home.  At the same time I was furious with <br/>\nher parents for sending her here under false pretenses and for not <br/>\nletting us know what was going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters Sarah (6) and Olivia (3.5) witnessed this exchange.  I <br/>\nthought it might upset them and confuse them but after Noelle ran <br/>\nupstairs they continued with their breakfasts happy as little larks, <br/>\ntalking and laughing.  They asked me if Noelle was going home.  I <br/>\ntold them yes in a day or two.  They seemed relieved.  Sarah <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I&#39;m glad she is going, Mommy.  She is rude to you.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got ready to go to Bible School and went out to the car.  I was <br/>\nhelping the girls in their seats when Noelle came out the front <br/>\ndoor, crying.  I put my arms around her and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNoelle was sobbing and she said, &quot;You think that I think you&#39;re a <br/>\nbad mother.  I don&#39;t think that.  I think you&#39;re a good mother.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that Sarah and Olivia get to do whatever they want and I <br/>\nnever get to do anything I want and it is so hard for me to be <br/>\naround that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI put my arms around her again and told her that when we started <br/>\nparenting differently and decided that choice was better than no <br/>\nchoice that I had those feelings, too, because I had little or no <br/>\nchoice when I was growing up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got in the car and I tried to talk with her more about what she <br/>\nhad just said.  (What a revelation!)  But she took out her iPod and <br/>\nput the earphones in--ending any conversation we could have had.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Bible School Noelle wanted to stay on at the church until <br/>\n9pm.  She was going to watch a &quot;Star Wars&quot; marathon and eat pizza <br/>\nwith a group of kids her age.  I was relieved that she had something <br/>\nshe wanted to do and that we would have a break from her as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got home I called Noelle&#39;s Dad, my brother-in-law.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  This is Linda<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  Hi, how&#39;s it going?<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  Not well, Noelle is very unhappy here and wants to come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  I&#39;m not surprised.  She wasn&#39;t too happy when she left.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  And you sent her anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  (Pause . . .)  We thought she&#39;d get over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  You need to think about listening to her and giving her what <br/>\nshe wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  Who gets a life like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  A kid should.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  Hmpf<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  A kid should at least get a taste of it so she knows what to <br/>\nshoot for as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  I&#39;ll have her mother call you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  You need to change her flight.  She wants to come home as soon <br/>\nas possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBIL:  I&#39;ll have her mother call you.  (Code for:  I&#39;m not doing a<br/>\n&%#$% thing.) (I got a feeling for what Noelle <br/>\nis dealing with.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so angry with I got off of the phone.  This poor obnoxious kid <br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t read a book unless forced and is the biggest pain in the <br/>\nyou-know-what, well, you can just see where this comes from.  At <br/>\nthat moment I felt so grateful that I can stay home with my children <br/>\nand keep them with me and not in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnd of Part 3:  Next Noelle&#39;s mother calls, we send Noelle home, and <br/>\na wrap-up of Noelle&#39;s comments about homeschooling (which I found <br/>\namazing).
