My name is Linda Greene.  I just joined unschooling-dotcom yesterday.  <br/>\n  &gt; I am very interested in unschooling but am scared to death, mainly because <br/>\n  &gt; my husband is very opposed to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Linda, <br/>\n  It is so good to &quot;see&quot; you on this list. The people on this list provide me <br/>\n  with so much insight into unschooling. Be prepared to have your thoughts <br/>\n  challenged. This is good. You may balk at first, but you&#39;ll also think about <br/>\n  what is said. Do not be offended. This is an unschooling list, so that is <br/>\n  what the people on this list do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My husband is second generation German immigrant, and fits many of the <br/>\n  stereotypes of the German people -- discipline, order, black and white <br/>\n  mentality, structure. Luckily, we live far enough away from his family and <br/>\n  been away for enough years that he has mellowed tremendously. Plus he lives <br/>\n  with me, the opposite in many ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I recently sent him an article written by Linda Dobson that I found on the <br/>\n  unschooling newsletter. I wish I kept a copy. It was about children learning <br/>\n  on their own schedule. It was short but to the point. He really took it to <br/>\n  heart, and let me know how much respect that he has for how the children are <br/>\n  learning and how I&#39;m allowing them the learn naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Welcome,<br/>\n  I hope you get the support (I know this is not a support group, but you guys <br/>\n  know what I mean) you are looking for. Listen to the veterans. They have so <br/>\n  much to offer. You&#39;ll quickly figure out who they are. Also consider <br/>\n  attending the unschooling conference in South Carolina in Oct. I&#39;m trying to <br/>\n  finagle a way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ginny from Keswick, VA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

This is an unschooling list, so that is <br/>\nwhat the people on this list do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is second generation German immigrant, and fits many of the <br/>\nstereotypes of the German people -- discipline, order, black and white <br/>\nmentality, structure.

Plus he lives <br/>\nwith me, the opposite in many ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently sent him an article written by Linda Dobson that I found on the <br/>\nunschooling newsletter. I wish I kept a copy. It was about children learning <br/>\non their own schedule. It was short but to the point. He really took it to <br/>\nheart, and let me know how much respect that he has for how the children are <br/>\nlearning and how I&#39;m allowing them the learn naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome,<br/>\nI hope you get the support (I know this is not a support group, but you guys <br/>\nknow what I mean) you are looking for.

I just joined unschooling-dotcom yesterday.  I am very interested in unschooling but am scared to death, mainly because my husband is very opposed to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n We homeschooled for the first time this past year.  I have two boys: Thomas age 11 and Daniel age 7 (8 in November).  My oldest really had a rough 3rd and 4th grade in public school.  His grades were poor and his self-esteem even worse.  He was angry, violent, teary all the time.  He was diagnosed ADHD, and depressed by a psychiatrist.  I was not about to put him on drugs, so I pulled him out of school (my husband was somewhat supportive).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started last year off with Calvert School curriculum....ACK!  What a mistake!  That lasted all of about 1 1/2 weeks.  I quickly backed off to math, science and some language arts workbooks, plus daily reading to my kids (well almost daily).  Many days we didn&#39;t do anything, or we went on field trips.  For the first time ever, Thomas, is reading a book on his own.  He read one book this summer and now is reading &quot;The Two Towers&quot; from the Tokien series to himself!  I am thrilled beyond belief.  We&#39;ve always had to read to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I had promised my husband I would push the kids a bit harder this year.   Oops!  Not a good idea.  Becuase, now I realize that I think unschooling (or at least mostly unschooling) is a really good idea, especially for Thomas.  I am also afraid that Thomas won&#39;t learn how to write papers and Daniel won&#39;t learn things like what verbs are.  Most of you are probably giggling at this.  Hopefully,  I will be, too, someday. ;o)  But, for now, I&#39;m scared and afraid to completely let go, while appeasing my husband who was once described by a friend (this was after the friend saw our garage) as being potty-trained at 3 months by a German Hun!  I think my husband was, too.  Well, he did spend part of his infancy in an orphanage which may explain some of it!!!  My is VERY anal, and VERY worried about the kids getting a proper education which includes testing...AAAAHHH!  His whole life revolves around order and disipline.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I filed under homeschooling option 1 in Virginia.  This option says that I can homeschool because I (or my spouse) has a degree.  My only requirement is to  give my kids the CAT (or a similar test) test at the end of the year.  I think I could keep a porfolio instead, but I&#39;m not up for that.  I do keep a daily journal for my husband&#39;s.  Not that he&#39;ll ever look at it, and it was my idea.  But, just in case he gets to be a p.i.t.a, I can stick it in his face and say, &quot;SEE!!!  They are learning!&quot;  For those of you that give your kids an end-of-the-year exam, how do your kids do on the tests and what things can I do to help them?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have filled our playroom with lots of interesting stuff - maps, cd&#39;s about space and science, games, tons of books.  I bought almost the entire Horribly History and Horribly Science series!  If nothing else, I&#39;ll read them. hee hee  They seem interested in some of them...especially my youngest whose love for learning hasn&#39;t been squelched.  I plan on just leaving them to find those things that interest them and gently encouraging them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, phew!!  I think that&#39;s it...for now. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda Greene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Introduction...long","postDate":"1030729629","msgId":42596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwODMwLjEwNDkxMi4tMzg3MTU5LjAuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42592,"nextInTopic":42609,"prevInTime":42595,"nextInTime":42597,"topicId":42572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Sat, 31 Aug 2002 12:19:01 -0400 Linda Greene ...
