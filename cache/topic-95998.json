The discussions are so great that I really <br/>\nappreciate being a part of them, even though I&#39;m just sitting here <br/>\nat the computer smiling, laughing, crying, etc. to myself. I rarely <br/>\npost on lists because I&#39;m relatively new to unschooling and feel I <br/>\nhave more to learn than contribute at this point. I find if I wait, <br/>\nmy views on a topic are usually posted by someone else, in a much <br/>\nbetter way than I had thought of!LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted to add that the Certificate of Empowerment was <br/>\ngreat for me as I started unschooling. I was one of those people who <br/>\nNEEDED it, and sometimes still do. Although, I don&#39;t have it right <br/>\nup on my desk anymore, I know right where it is if I need to pull it <br/>\nout and refer to it. I understood the paragraph in question, I <br/>\nthink, because I was already learning about unschooling. I do see <br/>\nhow it could be misconstrued by parents wanting to control their <br/>\nchildren more, unfortunately. I really like the way Rue suggested to <br/>\nreword it, if you feel like changing it at all, Sandra. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that&#39;s my opinion (plus alot more). I guess it&#39;s good I don&#39;t <br/>\npost too often, you see how wordy I tend to be. (I just remembered <br/>\nhow I used to get KISS on my English papers in school all the time. <br/>\nI guess I just refuse to be controlled!LOL) Thanks to all who do <br/>\npost. Don&#39;t stop, I&#39;m learning and growing thanks to YOU.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":95997,"nextTopicId":96003}}
