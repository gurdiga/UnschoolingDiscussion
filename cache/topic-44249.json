I have tried to help facilitate his interest - providing<br/>\nlessons when that was possible, buying CDs as gifts, supporting his<br/>\npursuing being a classical music programmer at our community radio station,<br/>\netc. . . but I never forced him to practice, or continue with lessons when<br/>\nhe felt he had gotten something out of it and was ready to stop or pause or<br/>\nswitch . . if a child has a gift and/or passion for music (or whatever) - I<br/>\nfeel I can only encourage and bless that. . . not &quot;make them&quot; do it. . . it<br/>\nis my opinion that doesn&#39;t work. <br/>\nJust my thoughts this windy, misty evening on Kauai,<br/>\nLee<br/>\nNorth Country Farms<br/>\nAn Organic Family Farm & Tropical B&B Cottages<br/>\n        . . . an eco-tourism destination . . . <br/>\nP.O.
