My husband&#39;s company set their <br/>\nlong-term goals using that term and I thought, &quot;Aha! Perfect for <br/>\nhomeschool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I asked my kids what big, hairy, audacious, sky&#39;s-the-limit kind <br/>\nof goals they would like to pursue while they&#39;re still kids at home. <br/>\nI was startled by the clarity and unique vision of each child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son, Noah (13), said that he&#39;d like to act in a Shakespeare <br/>\nplay, learn to design computer games and play the piano. Piano, it <br/>\nturns out, was the secret passion of Noah&#39;s heart. He had wanted <br/>\nlessons for years and began to well up with tears when he told me <br/>\nthat his life would be happy if he could just learn how to play. <br/>\nGulp! How come I hadn&#39;t known that?<br/>\n<br/>\nNext in line was my daughter, Johannah (11). She reeled off two <br/>\nenormous projects that took my breath away. She wants to produce a <br/>\nJane Austen-style ball instead of a high school prom for herself and <br/>\nother homeschooled friends. In order to do it, she needs to take <br/>\nvintage dance lessons, then hold classes to teach these dances to <br/>\nother kids. In addition, she plans to learn how to sew the dresses <br/>\nfrom that era so that she can make costumes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer second goal (as if that one didn&#39;t already overwhelm me) is to <br/>\ndirect her own production of A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. &quot;And I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to do it, Mom,&quot; she told me emphatically. I didn&#39;t doubt her!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid, school provided me with sensible goals that <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t interfere with my parents&#39; lives too much. I wasn&#39;t taught <br/>\nto dream about bigger-than-life projects that would require driving <br/>\nall over kingdom come or that would oblige my family to participate <br/>\nin my areas of interest. Instead, I joined the pre-fab school <br/>\norganizations that offered me bite-sized experiences of the interests <br/>\nI had. Certainly some of my teachers rose above the mediocrity and <br/>\ncontributed profoundly to my life, but on the whole, most of my <br/>\nschool life was keenly managed and required mere compliance from me. <br/>\nI didn&#39;t own the experiences and I certainly didn&#39;t orchestrate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter the B-HAG into our family. Suddenly I&#39;m on a radical learning <br/>\ncurve led by my kids. It dawned on me that instead of micro-managing <br/>\ntheir experiences, I could throw myself into their big dreams by <br/>\noffering the kind of support that an adult can give to a young person <br/>\n- I can drive, I can look stuff up in the phone book, on the Internet <br/>\nand in the community papers, I can fix hair to look like Lizzie <br/>\nBennett.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I don&#39;t have to muster is the energy to &quot;get up&quot; for these <br/>\nactivities. We&#39;ve found that the B-HAG itself drives our children to <br/>\na level of motivation that releases energy throughout the family.  ~ <br/>\nJulie Bogart in the May/June 2001 issue of Home Education Magazine ~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read the rest of this article at our website at the address <br/>\nunder the title of this excerpt.

No more <br/>\nstate-mandated testing for these homeschoolers. The relevant section <br/>\nof the law reads as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n45th Legislature, First Session, Laws 2001, Chapter 62,<br/>\nSenate Bill 374 as amended<br/>\n22-1-2.1 HOME SCHOOL -- REQUIREMENTS.-- Any person operating or <br/>\nintending to operate a home school shall:<br/>\nA. within thirty days of its establishment, notify the state <br/>\nsuperintendent of the establishment of a home school within thirty <br/>\ndays of its establishment and notify the state superintendent in <br/>\nwriting on or before April 1 of each subsequent year of operation of <br/>\nthe school district from which the home school is drawing students;<br/>\nB. maintain records of student disease immunization or a waiver of <br/>\nthat requirement; and<br/>\nC. provide instruction by a person possessing at least a high school <br/>\ndiploma or its equivalent.<br/>\nCongratulations New Mexico homeschoolers, on a job well done!

If you answered yes to any of MY <br/>\nquestions, this is your chance to send YOUR question to me! In every <br/>\nissue of Home Education Magazine, I answer one or two questions in a <br/>\ncolumn called Ask Carol. Some of the questions I&#39;ve been asked are:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Can I homeschool if I have a tattoo and ride a Harley?<br/>\n* What if my kids won&#39;t work?<br/>\n* How can I unschool and still test?<br/>\n* How can I homeschool with a toddler in the house?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a troubling or intriguing question, a funny or serious <br/>\nquestion, or just want to dig a little deeper into homeschooling <br/>\nissues, let me know by sending an email to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AskCarol@...\">AskCarol@...</a>.

Laurel Schmidt&#39;s book Seven Time Smarter: 50 <br/>\nActivities, Games, and Projects to Develop the Seven Intelligences of <br/>\nYour Child can not only help, most of the activities are perfect for <br/>\nunschooling and homeschooling families. In fact, Schmidt says about <br/>\nschools, &quot;With all these ways of being smart, why do so many kids <br/>\nfeel dumb? One big reason is school, which can be a crushing <br/>\nexperience for any kid, unless they have strong linguistic and <br/>\nmathematical intelligence...So you can be your kids&#39; best teacher <br/>\nsimply by turning them loose in your basement, backyard, or garage. <br/>\nOn their own they&#39;ll discover hundreds of ways to get smarter, with <br/>\nlittle prompting, and no money changing hands.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSchmidt believes parents should let kids explore and create on their <br/>\nown. For instance, she recommends making &quot;un-models&quot; by throwing away <br/>\nthe instructions for model kits and letting kids put them together <br/>\ntheir own way or by mixing up the pieces of several models and seeing <br/>\nwhat they come up with. She&#39;s also a big fan of boredom, believing as <br/>\nmany homeschoolers do that boredom encourages imagination. Kids are <br/>\nmuch more likely to build a fort from tables and sheets if they <br/>\naren&#39;t being shuttled from one &quot;enrichment&quot; opportunity to another. <br/>\nYou provide the sheets and card tables.<br/>\n<br/>\nEleven chapters show you ways to encourage your child&#39;s creativity <br/>\nand intelligence, mostly using materials you have around the house or <br/>\nrecycled &quot;junk.&quot; Each chapter offers several options, geared toward <br/>\nthe particular intelligences, for investigating different topics <br/>\nincluding families and self; movement and sound; odds and ends <br/>\n(junk); writing; handmade tasks; books; art; out-of-doors and your <br/>\ncommunity. Many of the sections in the chapters also include a list <br/>\nof books or other resources to encourage reading and further <br/>\nexploration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven Times Smarter is available through your favorite bookseller or <br/>\nfrom Amazon.com for $15.00 ($12 at Amazon).<br/>\n<br/>\n^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^%^<br/>\n<br/>\nHEM ONLINE NEWS UNCLASSIFIED ADVERTISING<br/>\n<br/>\nFor information on purchasing unclassified advertising space in this <br/>\nnewsletter, please contact the editor at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HEM-Newsletter@...\">HEM-Newsletter@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n________<br/>\n<br/>\nUSBORNE<br/>\nUsborneAmerica.com<br/>\n<br/>\nNew titles for Spring and Summer are here -- including <br/>\nInternet-Linked history and science books!
