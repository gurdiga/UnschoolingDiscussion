He loves D & D weapons, He came back from the <br/>\nStarwars II and gave a complete play by play of the different sword <br/>\nfights.  The Yoda fight took up the whole living room. Oh yeah he <br/>\ndoes sound effects too.  He would love to take a class (&quot;real&quot; swords <br/>\nnot fencing) but is not ready to commit to the whole martial arts <br/>\nclasses which likely procede this.  He and siblings and the neighbor <br/>\nkids had an elaborate wooden/plastic sword fight game meshed with D & <br/>\nD going last night. It is way cool but beyond me.  He &quot;kills&quot; plenty <br/>\nof people and is at heart very, very sensitive. <br/>\nBeth <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, we tried to avoid guns here at some point...<br/>\nWe still ended up with plenty of Water guns and the kids are getting <br/>\nmore Nerf ones for Xmas.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51418,"nextTopicId":51705}}
