Alaska is home to me, <br/>\nalways has been, always will be. My entire family, including our <br/>\noldest son and his family, live there. Longtime readers of Home <br/>\nEducation Magazine know that we&#39;ve tried to move back up there at <br/>\nleast twice now, the last time two years ago, but complications <br/>\nrelating to running a publishing company from there, coupled with the <br/>\nastronomical expense of feeding our small herd of horses up there, <br/>\nand a decided lack of sailboat-friendly bodies of water, sent us back <br/>\nto Washington state again. So we live here, but *LIVE* there, <br/>\ntravelling north as often as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike later this week. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the legalities, I don&#39;t know what they are, really. I know <br/>\nthere are residency requirements, but I think we travel between the <br/>\ntwo states often enough to skirt them for the most part. We all still <br/>\ncarry Alaskan driver&#39;s licenses, and three or four of our vehicles <br/>\nhave Alaskan license plates, although several other cars and trucks <br/>\n(ours and the kids&#39;) have Washington plates... Washington has a <br/>\npretty high number of Alaskan &quot;snowbirds&quot; though, so people really <br/>\ndon&#39;t pay that much attention here. I think there might be more <br/>\nAlaskans per capita in Washington state than any other, just because <br/>\nof the proximity, such as it is...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it boils down to intent. Which state do you intend to be a <br/>\nresident of. For me, that&#39;s not much of a question. I&#39;ll go home <br/>\npermanently some day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"lite2yu@aol.com","from":"lite2yu@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"_XT6UdCvxHMgHfANxCDdLba4dkGlbgEUvrQE52ymtOTKB6D7RDaZunArcF4ZHjaVzH7Ius8Q","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Dual REsidency?","postDate":"990554922","msgId":21724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRmLmMxYjIxMDIuMjgzYzA1MmFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21737,"prevInTime":21723,"nextInTime":21725,"topicId":21724,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/22/2001 11:07:12 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
