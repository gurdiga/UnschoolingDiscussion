But<br/>\nshe feels the pressure of the stress of school, the expectations placed on<br/>\nher because she is a high achiever, and she does not feel that school is<br/>\nmeeting her emotional or educational needs.  She lives in a very depressed<br/>\narea (one of the worst in the country) and as she gets older she finds<br/>\nthere are less opportunites for her in the IS (Institutionalized Schooling)<br/>\nsystem.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was here I gave her lots of info and we had a lot of discussions<br/>\nabout Homeschooling, and Unschooling in particular. She was VERY<br/>\ninterested, but I do not think that either of her parents is in a place<br/>\n(financially or emotionally) to be able to let her Unschool.  We are still<br/>\ntalking (over phone and corespondence) about her options and I am sending<br/>\nalong any kind of info for her Mom, in case she makes a decision in my<br/>\nniece&#39;s favor for Unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is 13, and we talked about how I took myself out of school at 14<br/>\nbecause it was not serving my needs and was Unschooling myself to a great<br/>\ndegree.  I don&#39;t know if she would be assertive enough to do that, nor<br/>\nwould I want to cause a problem in her house, but I think it lets her see<br/>\nher education in another light (ie: the it is for HER and not to please her<br/>\nparents or teachers or for Grandma&#39;s grade money in the summer or<br/>\nwhatever.)  She is a great kid, and she pushes herself very hard.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nsee the need for any outside pressures on her and I feel for her being so<br/>\npressed to the grindstone.  I don&#39;t think she has really had much of a<br/>\nchildhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to answer your question.  Although she was not here all that long<br/>\nthis summer, I think it was long enough to make a difference for her.  I<br/>\nwas afraid she might have been bored, as most of our days were spent<br/>\nhanging around the house while I took care of the boys and she read,<br/>\nwatched t.v., worked on complex art coloring books I have, made some beaded<br/>\njewelry or talked with me.  We went to the zoo a couple of times and once<br/>\nto the little amusement park in town, and went shopping, made a stop at the<br/>\nused bookstore to trade some books, and just did every day stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy fears of her being bored or disappointed were dispelled a couple of<br/>\nweeks after she went back to my parents&#39; house to finish her vacation.  I<br/>\nspoke with her on the phone, and was asking her how she was doing etc.  She<br/>\nwas having a good time visiting with her 15 year old cousin from the East<br/>\ncoast who was also at Grandma&#39;s house for a visit.  She said that they had<br/>\ntalked (she and her cousin) and had decided that they were BOTH coming here<br/>\nnext summer, but that they were going to stay the WHOLE summer this time!!<br/>\nFine with me!  I will be happy to spend time with them both.  They are<br/>\ngrowing into really interesting and beautiful young women (inside and out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K. in Idaho</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Jane E.","from":"&quot;Jane E.&quot; &lt;jaelise@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"J5BTXpH5WCV2onOwsg2hC4MjBD3YyTjSc6ifQTbWpfh-pkwJCok5NHJkIoKe2Hpi0RBZ7mTXhpavX6XsKY8H1zVczisTYnspG8rn","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling Others Children","postDate":"935423056","msgId":2231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xNjcuMjIzMS45NTkyNjk3NDFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2227,"nextInTopic":2237,"prevInTime":2230,"nextInTime":2232,"topicId":2227,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":".
