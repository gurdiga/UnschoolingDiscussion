Maybe I<br/>\nam feeling chatty, or maybe I just want to vent and cheer, etc.  Here we<br/>\ngo...<br/>\n<br/>\nPool Parties.... The kids went to a pool party last thursday to celebrate a<br/>\nfriend&#39;s (Julia) 7th birthday.  The child&#39;s brilliant parents requested that<br/>\nno one buy gifts but rather make a card or gift for their daughter, Julia.<br/>\nMy kids were VERY happy about this, cause they love to make things for<br/>\npeople.  We had made some &quot;ancient&quot; scrolls earlier in the week.  Max (my<br/>\n8yo) made a name poem for julia and put it in a scroll.  Sam (my 11yo) made<br/>\na bead necklace and a basket out of rainbow colored craft sticks to hold the<br/>\nscroll.   They had a wonderful time at the party and Julia loved the gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nHubby and I attended a pool party Saturday night.  It is held every year for<br/>\nthe adults in our community.  (we live in an apartment/townhome community,<br/>\nmy hubby works for the management company, he is the director of IS) There<br/>\nis catered food (chinese this time, mmmm) and free beer and karaoke.  We got<br/>\nto talk to lots of friends who we have not seen in ages! We got lots of<br/>\ncompliments on the kids, how they have grown, how well behaved they are, how<br/>\npolite, inventive, etc.  My favorite part is watching the mostly &quot;stuffy,<br/>\nall business types&quot; cut loose and dance and have fun.  Oh and swimming at<br/>\nnight is great, because I am a redhead with fair skin and burn within only<br/>\n20 minutes in the sun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day there was a knock on the door, not unusual, kids are always<br/>\ncoming to ask Sam & Max to play.  But this time it was for me!?!?! hahaha A<br/>\nlady who lives a few doors down came by to drop off some pics of our kids at<br/>\nher daughter&#39;s birthday party from a few weeks ago.  She stayed and chatted<br/>\nand we got along very well.  I also discovered that my dog, MOJO, is more<br/>\nwell behaved than I give him credit for hehehe. Anyway, after chatting a bit<br/>\nabout painting the house, we went down to her place so I could see the<br/>\npainting she has done.  I was very inspired and have decided to paint our<br/>\nhome as well. After leaving there I was walking home and ran into some other<br/>\nparents of my kids&#39; friends.  They asked about homeschooling.  We chatted a<br/>\nwhile, the father is a musician, he offered to teach Sam how to play her<br/>\nkeyboard if she is interested. He showed me his studio where he makes his<br/>\nmusic, I was in awe at all the neat equipment!  Oh and we also got invited<br/>\nto goto the pool with another friend of ours.  We went for about an hour, I<br/>\ngot sunburned but it was fun playing ball in the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday, I got sick, very sick, coughing, sneezing, etc.  I was miserable!<br/>\nNot to mention I was in so much pain (back problems, 2 degenrated discs).  I<br/>\ndid not sleep at all sunday night so monday I was in really bad shape.  The<br/>\nkids were angels!  They very quietly played the computers (lego.com,<br/>\nbarbie.com, and other games, etc) I slept on and off while on the couch.<br/>\nHubby offered to stay home with me.  But one of his employees was on<br/>\nvacation then another one called in sick so he had to goto the office. The<br/>\nkids were good all day.  The lady down the street stops by to chat, had to<br/>\ntell her I was really sick, didn&#39;t want to pass it to her baby.  She says<br/>\n&quot;come over as soon as you are feeling better&quot;   (Good! I actually have a<br/>\nsocial life now! hahaha)<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday, got a call I have been waiting for for 3 months.  Our insurance had<br/>\nfinally approved the IDET procedure for my back.  Scheduled it for the 15th,<br/>\nbut uh oh! I have a cold and if it is not gone by then I have to reschedule.<br/>\nSo I called my doc setup an appointment for Wed.  One of the nieghborhood<br/>\nparents dropped off a bag full of books for Sam & Max.  Sam found an oragami<br/>\nbook and loves it.  She made me a candy dish for my desk, it is really cute!<br/>\nMax & dh played alot of star wars on the Xbox. DH is coming down with my<br/>\ncold now, we are both miserable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWednesday, DH called in sick, but worked from home. I goto the doctor.  He<br/>\nsays he promises I will be well in time for the IDET, puts me on<br/>\nantibiotics. When I get home a good surprise in the mail, The Lord of the<br/>\nRings DVD has arrived (with a free t-shirt).  The kids scream with joy.  We<br/>\nall sit down to watch it again (saw it in theatres). I absolutely LOVE this<br/>\nmovie, we all do. DH is feeling very bad, we are both so sick, can hardly<br/>\nmove.  Max caught a praying mantis in the backyard.  He put it in his bug<br/>\ncollector kit. He is very excited!<br/>\n<br/>\nThursday, DH leaves for work, within 1 hour he is back home (sick still),<br/>\nlooks terribly ill.  He spends the day on the phone and computer, trying to<br/>\ncatch up on missed work.  I spend the morning catching up on emails.  The<br/>\nkids were watching Lord of the Rings for the 3rd time.  We talk about the<br/>\nmovie and the books.  We watch the special features (making of).  My parents<br/>\ncall and say they are coming down next week.  Going to get a hotel room with<br/>\na pool and keep the kids for a couple of days after my back treatment.  I am<br/>\nreally happy because I don&#39;t like for the kids to see me suffering in pain,<br/>\nit worries them needlessly.  My cold symptoms are fading a little.  DH is<br/>\nstill miserable.  We order pizza for dinner, no one feels like cooking.  We<br/>\nhad a long family discussion about unschooling.  The kids didn&#39;t understand<br/>\nwhy we were not doing school-at-home anymore, the asked lots of questions.<br/>\nThey seemed satisfied with the answers we gave.  Max had me help him find<br/>\ninfo about what to feed his praying manits.  We viewed a video about flying<br/>\nsnakes too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is Friday.  DH returned to work this am, he is still sick but<br/>\ngetting better slowly.<br/>\nIn some respects it has been a miserable week.  But some really good things<br/>\nhappened this week.  There is yet another pool party for all the kids in the<br/>\nneighbohood tonight.  Sam & Max don&#39;t want to go tho.  I am not really sure<br/>\nwhy, they just decided not to. They have lots of friends here, but some of<br/>\nthe other kids are bullies, especially at the pool and park.  I think this<br/>\nworries the kids.  They don&#39;t like trouble and they tend to come racing home<br/>\nat this slightest hint of problems with other kids.  I think this is good.<br/>\nI can trust them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I have rambled long enough and if you are still reading and still<br/>\nawake, thanks for listening!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nZan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40552,"nextTopicId":40568}}
