catch phrase.&nbsp; at first my\ngut response was this is not an unschooling perspective, a gentle and respectful\nstance like waldorf, but not an unschooling one.&nbsp; my problem was that\ni could not say why i felt this way because i&#39;ve always taken my understanding\nof unschooling for granted.&nbsp; unschooling came natural/instinctive\nto me so i never pushed myself to read enough to actual compare unschooling\nto other methods beyond the superficial.\n<p>i read through one c.m. sites info/faq page and one thing they pointed\nout was that all though there is respect for the child it is believed when\na child is left alone s/he will take the easy way.&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore\na structure, in the form of &#39;narrations&#39; needs to be introduced and fostered,\nin a fun way, so learning will move beyond the superficial.&nbsp; imo this\nis not a position an unschooler would hold, rather an unschooler would\ntrust that the child is experiencing things in accordance to her/his own\nneeds at the moment or perhaps feel the child is not being exposed or surrounded\nby learning as learning is a lifestyle not something superimposed for a\nlimited time (m thru f from 8 to 3 from the age of 5 to 18 or during a\n&#39;study period&#39;).&nbsp; also the position of &#39;no twaddle&#39; set someone up\nto judge just what is &#39;twaddle&#39; and what is not, in most case this would\nnot be the child.&nbsp; again imo this would be inconsistent with unschool.\n<p>so with these thoughts i decided instead of delving into c.m. i really\nshould bone up on holt etc., and become more versed it unschooling philosophy\nrather than get distracted (at this point anyway) by the myriad of philosophies\nout there.&nbsp; it&#39;s been 15 years, give or take, since i&#39;ve read anything\nwritten by john holt it seemed high time.&nbsp; so i took <u>teach your\nown</u> off the shelf and i&#39;m really glad i did.&nbsp; below you&#39;ll find\nsome excerpts, though this is one of those books you really should take\nthe time to read because he addresses so many idea/concerns we talk about\non this list.&nbsp; the following are regarding qualifications to teach\nchildren, the concern of many that parents will not have the right &#39;credentials&#39;\nto do an adequate job of educating their children.\n<p>&#39;... for a long long time, people who were good at sharing what they\nknew have realized certain things:\n<br>(1) to help people learn something, you must first understand what\nthey already know;\n<br>(2) showing people how to do something is better than telling, and\nletting them do it themselves is best of all;\n<br>(3) you mustn&#39;t tell or show too much at once, since people digest\nnew ideas slowly and must feel secure with new skills or knowledge before\nthey are ready for more;\n<br>(4) you must give people as much time as they want and need to absorb\nwhat you have shown or told them;\n<br>(5) instead of testing their understanding with questions you let them\nshow you how much or how little they understand by the questions they ask\nyou;\n<br>(6) you must not get impatient or angry when people do not understand;\n<br>(7) scaring people only blocks their learning...&#39;&nbsp; (pg34)\n<p>&#39;we can sum up very quickly what people need to teach their own children.&nbsp;\nfirst of all, they have to <i>like</i> them, enjoy their company, their\nphysical presence, their energy, foolishness, and passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthey have to enjoy all their questions, and enjoy equally trying to answer\nthose questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; they have to think of their children as friends,\nindeed very close friends, have to feel happier when near and miss them\nwhen they are away. they have to trust them as people, respect their fragile\ndignity, treat them with courtesy, take them seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; they\nhave to feel in their own hearts some of their children&#39;s wonder, curiosity,\nand excitement about the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; and they have to have enough\nconfidence in themselves, scepticism about experts, and willingness to\nbe different from most people, to take on themselves the responsibility\nfor their children&#39;s learning.&nbsp; but that is about all the parents\nneed.&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps only a minority of parents have these qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\ncertainly some have more than others.&nbsp;&nbsp; many will gain more as\nthey know their children better; most of the people who have been teaching\ntheir children at home say that it has made like them more, not less.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nin any case, these are not qualities that can be taught or learned in school,\nor measured with a test, or certified with a piece of paper.&#39;\n<p>i love this philosophy.&nbsp; i know it&#39;s demanding when one is up against\nschool districts, family members, and/or friends who demand &#39;proof of progress&#39;\nbut it is a lifestyle which is based in love, respect, faith, and equality.&nbsp;\nit is a lifestyle of adventure which moves slow some days and zips along\nother days.&nbsp; i&#39;m certainly not qualified to make an accurate assessment,\nmeaning i&#39;ve not read anything written by charlotte mason and it appears\nthough her heart was in the right place, but it does not feel like unschooling.&nbsp;\nwhen i read, for example, grace llewelyn or mary griffin it feels like\nunschooling.\n<p>jmo,\n<br>susan\n<br>austin,tx\n<br>&#39;unity through diversity&#39;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;</p></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7319,"nextTopicId":7323}}
