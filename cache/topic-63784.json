Miranda, was assistant manger in a french restaurant on a very <br/>\nbusy night. They had several young Vietnamese men as waiters and busboys. The <br/>\nmanager walked by and asked one of the busboys to please open a can of <br/>\ncherries and pour it over the cheesecake on the dessert cart. The fellow did <br/>\nas he was told. A waiter cut a piece and served it. My friend Miranda saw as <br/>\nshe walked by that it was NOT cherries, but green OLIVES! on the cake. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore she went to apologize to the guest with the slice, she told the <br/>\nmanager. The manager held Miranda back and took care of it herself. She <br/>\nwalked up and asked the guest how she liked her cheesecake. The woman RAVED <br/>\nabout how clever and innovative the chef must be! That was the best cake <br/>\nshe&#39;d ever had, and could she have the recipe! &lt;G&gt; The manager smiled and <br/>\nsaid and that she was glad she liked it---and she would tell the chef how <br/>\nhappy the guest was!<br/>\n<br/>\nMiranda says she learned a valuable lesson in restaurant management that day! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63781,"nextTopicId":63785}}
