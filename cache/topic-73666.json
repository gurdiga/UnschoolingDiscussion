I know the tests are sometimes <br/>\n  ambiguous in their wording, but I also find that a good way to <br/>\n  determine type is to look at the description for the types you feel <br/>\n  closely resemble you, and the right one should be pretty obvious.  <br/>\n  Maybe not the most scientific of methods, but if nothing more, it <br/>\n  would be a fun way to see how &quot;uniform&quot; our personalities are or <br/>\n  aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Here is a fun description page that I liked because it isn&#39;t just a <br/>\n  generic, &quot;good qualities&quot; one.  It has a little humor in pointing out <br/>\n  the less-desirable aspects of each personality type also.  You have <br/>\n  to scroll way down to find &quot;THE 16 TYPES IN FULL DETAIL&quot; with the 16 <br/>\n  types in blue, and click on your type.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~PersonalityInstitute/Personality1.htm\">http://members.tripod.com/~PersonalityInstitute/Personality1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Have fun!<br/>\n  Tory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
