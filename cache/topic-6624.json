I do not worry anymore, he was in<br/>\nschool until last spring and it made it worse not better, he is a happy<br/>\nboy and much more comfortable around people of all ages, races and<br/>\nphysical conditions than most children, I think your daughter probably<br/>\njust needs to be with people more her maturity and&#92;or interests with less<br/>\nconcern for age than most of of show. Let her experience lots of ages and<br/>\nshe will find her own place.<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, 18 Feb 2000 15:11:03 +1300 michele clausen<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madklausen@...\">madklausen@...</a>&gt; writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From: michele clausen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:madklausen@...\">madklausen@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi. I am wondering if someone can help me with a question that been<br/>\n&gt; bugging me for a while..........<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll try and make a long story short!  We have just been &#39;dumped&#39; by <br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &#39;friend&#39; of ours. My daughter and one of hers were best friends, very<br/>\n&gt; close - a wonderful relationship. Well as you can imagine Anna was<br/>\n&gt; heartbroken when this h/schooling friend of mine decided we were no<br/>\n&gt; longer a fine enough example for her girls.<br/>\n&gt; Anyway....this got me wondering about the issue of friends and<br/>\n&gt; socialization etc. We are involved in alot of activities, some with<br/>\n&gt; h/schoolers some without, and Anna doesn&#39;t seem to make friends with <br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; of them!!!!  She is very mature for her age and I&#39;m wondering if this<br/>\n&gt; has anything to do with it.<br/>\n&gt; Is this a normal thing - Anna is six and very social and while she<br/>\n&gt; desperately misses her lost friend,<br/>\n&gt; she otherwise seems reasonably content. I think I have nothing too <br/>\n&gt; much<br/>\n&gt; to be concerned about but was wondering what you guys think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks<br/>\n&gt; Michele.<br/>\n&gt; NZ.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --------------------------- ONElist Sponsor <br/>\n&gt; ----------------------------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Get what you deserve with NextCard Visa.
