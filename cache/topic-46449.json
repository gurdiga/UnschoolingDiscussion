In my experience, belief <br/>\nin evolution can be a big stumbling block to a person&#39;s belief in <br/>\nGod.

So for those who are <br/>\ninterested or who want to show their children how to look at both <br/>\nsides of an issue, I have listed some points where a Christian non-<br/>\nscientist who believes in the Biblical account of creation can agree <br/>\nwith a Jewish microbiologist who believes in a creator and <br/>\nevolution.

Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nPoints of agreement  (author&#39;s statements are numbered, followed by <br/>\nmy agreement).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;1. Natural selection is *not* actually a biological process. It is a <br/>\n&gt;mathematical and thermodynamic one, and *no one* (not even the <br/>\n&gt;fundamentalists) is disputing the mathematical and thermodynamic <br/>\n&gt;laws (they are so certain as to be actually called &quot;laws&quot;) which <br/>\n&gt;give rise to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  Creationists and evolutionists both believe in natural <br/>\nselection.   You can see it at work, and you can see evidence of it <br/>\nin the past.  Natural selection works within a species to help <br/>\norganisms to adapt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  Creationists do not believe that natural selection can help an <br/>\norganism evolve into another species. We all should be aware of what <br/>\nsomeone means when they use the word evolution:  are they talking <br/>\nabout adaptation within a species, transformation to another species, <br/>\nformation of life, or origin of the universe (claymation, as someone <br/>\ncutely termed it earlier)?  &quot;Evolution is a fact&quot; can be quite <br/>\nbelievable when referring to natural selection (adaptation), but much <br/>\nless proven (or scientifically verifiable) when referring to the <br/>\norigin of the universe. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;2. How does that fit in with the Biblical version of creation? It <br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard lots of people suggest that if  you simply <br/>\n&gt;redefine the length of a &quot;day,&quot; then everything&#39;s fine. But it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  The Biblical account of creation does not describe evolution, <br/>\neven if you just call each day so many thousands or millions of <br/>\nyears.  And the word for &quot;day&quot; in the Bible is the same word that is <br/>\nused for a 24 hour day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  3.  And folks are homing on on how those nucleotides could have <br/>\n&gt;arisen in the first place through random chemical reactions that <br/>\n&gt;could reasonably have occurred on the early Earth. In other words, <br/>\n&gt;science *has* a plausible answer to the question, one that we are <br/>\n&gt;actively testing and refining.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  Science has a hypothesis that a reasonable person could <br/>\nimagine happened, and scientists are testing it out to see if it will <br/>\nwork.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  However, even if it does work, and reasonable mathematicians <br/>\nagree that there is some chance of the random chemical reactions <br/>\ncreating life, it does not mean that it did happen that way.  And a <br/>\nreasonable person will place less stock in it if the math equations <br/>\nshow a very small chance.  This is where many evolutionists are <br/>\nunwilling to even consider the possibility of a young earth, because <br/>\nthen none of the millions of years needed for this hypothesis would <br/>\nbe present.  But young earth is a subject for another post on another <br/>\nforum.  I&#39;ve already posted a number of URLs that address creation in <br/>\nan earlier post.  E-mail me if you&#39;d like them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  4.  The more we learn about life, the more it looks like it&#39;s a <br/>\n&gt;mathematical certainty for life to occur, even in the harshest <br/>\n&gt;environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  Earth is the perfect place for life to occur.  The atmosphere <br/>\nprotects us from meteorites and provides oxygen, the distance from <br/>\nthe sun provides water in a liquid state (rather than gaseous or <br/>\nfrozen), and many other things.  As for &quot;even in the harshest <br/>\nenvironments&quot;, she expands on that later in point 6, where she finds <br/>\nthat the laws of nature were created to cause life to occur.  Amen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  5.  Mythological stories are the way we tell ourselves about our <br/>\n&gt;world and ourselves, and they can have deep truth to them without <br/>\n&gt;needing to have even a shred of literal truth. Figure out what you <br/>\n&gt;can learn about the world and your place within it from this text <br/>\n&gt;and from what other people have said about it over the centuries -- <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that&#39;s what&#39;s important about the story, not whether creation started <br/>\non a Thursday or a Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue, and I said the same thing in a post earlier.  I wholeheartedly <br/>\nagree that the Bible accounts have great impact, whether they are <br/>\ntaken literally or allegorically.  I&#39;ve copied the URL for a web site <br/>\n(there are many others) that says the same thing:  &quot;Will I approach <br/>\nthe Bible as God&#39;s message to me?&quot;  <br/>\nhttp://www.salisburybible.org/Questions%20About%<br/>\n20God/is_the_bible_true.htm <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  6.

When I <br/>\n&gt;learn of a new scientific discovery which shows me more of the <br/>\n&gt;incredible beauty and diversity that has created itself according to <br/>\n&gt;the incredibly simple mathematical laws of the cosmos, I am moved <br/>\n&gt;to say a blessing to God who set such a wondrous self-creating <br/>\n&gt;system in motion. Frankly, I am *more* impressed by a God who built <br/>\n&gt;a self-creating system than I am by the image of someone with a <br/>\n&gt;whole lot of Tinker Toys.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Awesome.  Many scientists have their spiritual heads in the sand and <br/>\njust ignore any indication of a creator.  Some even admit that they <br/>\nstrive to defend evolution and ignore evidence for creation because <br/>\nthey can&#39;t face the fact that there might be a creator.  It is great <br/>\nto read a post from a scientist who believes there is a creator and <br/>\nwho enjoys seeing his work.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deborah Lewis","from":"Deborah Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Evolution","postDate":"1034719729","msgId":46485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIxMDE1LjE2MDg0OS42MzIuNy5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46449,"nextInTopic":46519,"prevInTime":46484,"nextInTime":46486,"topicId":46449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really enjoyed that Peggy, thank you.

We use the word &quot;theory&quot; differently in science than we do in general<br/>\nparlance.  Gravity, in science, is also a theory, but we don&#39;t hear people<br/>\narguing that alternate views should be taught (well, okay, if you want to<br/>\ninclude general relativity, then fine, but that&#39;s not an alternate view,<br/>\njust an expanded one).  The word &quot;theory&quot; in general parlance is more like<br/>\nthe scientific word &quot;hypothesis,&quot; which means educated guess, reasonable<br/>\npossibility according to the data still present.  For something to be a<br/>\nscientific theory, it generally means that the data present overwhelming<br/>\nsupport for it, to the point where there really aren&#39;t any other reasonable<br/>\nand testable hypotheses.  Evolution is about as close to a fact as we<br/>\nscientists are willing to call anything that we cannot directly observe<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t have a time machine handy.  We do certainly observe change<br/>\nin species over time happening in real time right now.  We also certainly<br/>\nobserve evolution occurring in test-tube situations, and it is beginning to<br/>\nbe used as a technique for &quot;designing&quot; useful things.  The people who<br/>\npropose alternate hypotheses don&#39;t have data to back them up, and are<br/>\nbasically just creationists trying to use scientific-sounding language in<br/>\nthe hopes of being taken seriously by scientists and sneaking the Christian<br/>\nversion of creation into biology texts.  Just because something is phrased<br/>\nlike a hypothesis doesn&#39;t mean that it is testable (which is a requirement<br/>\nin the scientific world), nor does it mean that it has any data to support<br/>\nit.  Not all hypotheses are worthy of equal time, because they&#39;re not all<br/>\nequally likely to be true.  There are a variety of different hypotheses<br/>\nwithin the basic evolutionary hypotheses (steady state vs. punctuated<br/>\nequilibrium, etc), but none of them require the presence of a conscious<br/>\nCreator.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) Natural selection is *not* actually a biological process.  It is a<br/>\nmathematical and thermodynamic one, and *no one* (not even the<br/>\nfundamentalists) is disputing the mathematical and thermodynamic laws (they<br/>\nare so certain as to be actually called &quot;laws&quot;) which give rise to it.<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it works:<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) Any time there is an object which can replicate itself, it is using<br/>\nenergy to resist entropy (disorder).  Things are naturally disordered;<br/>\nmaking a copy of yourself is creating order and hence costs energy to do.<br/>\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics says, &quot;The amount of useful energy<br/>\navailable in any system always goes down -- some useful energy is always<br/>\nlost.  In short, not only can&#39;t you win (the First Law), you can&#39;t even<br/>\nbreak even.&quot;  To make a perfect copy every time would require spending<br/>\ninfinite energy, which is not  available.  Therefore, it is a thermodynamic<br/>\n*certainty* that some copies will be imperfect in random ways (the random<br/>\nmutations of Darwinian evolution).<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) Any time there is an object which can replicate itself, the number of<br/>\nobjects of this type will grow (or shrink) exponentially (faster and faster,<br/>\ny = pe^(rt), the number of individuals at any time is the number you started<br/>\nwith times the number e=2.71828... to the power of the intrinsic rate of<br/>\ngrowth over time, times the time that has passed).  That&#39;s the mathematical<br/>\nlaw of exponential growth, which is derived easily in any Algebra II class.<br/>\nYou take advantage of this law every time you put money in the bank -- in<br/>\nfinance, it&#39;s called &quot;the law (or the miracle) of compound interest.&quot;  Even<br/>\nfor very small intrinsic rates of growth (I won&#39;t go into it here, but<br/>\nsuffice it to say that the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the mathematical<br/>\nprinciple of trichotomy make it impossible to have a growth rate of exactly<br/>\nzero), any population of self-replicating objects will eventually produce<br/>\nmore and more individuals (or die out completely, if the growth rate is<br/>\nnegative).  Eventually, *any* self-replicating population will grow to the<br/>\npoint where there is not enough of *some* resource (typically food, which<br/>\ncontains the energy the critters need to continue resisting entropy) to go<br/>\naround.  This was Malthus&#39;s big insight.  No one is disputing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(c) Any time where there are more individuals wanting a resource than there<br/>\nis resource to go around, they will compete for it.  This is known in<br/>\neconomics as the law of supply and demand.  Those who have more of whatever<br/>\nskills or other resources they need to get the limited resource, well,<br/>\nthey&#39;re the ones who will get it.  It&#39;s just like when there aren&#39;t enough<br/>\nTickle Me Elmo dolls to go around: people with more money and more quickness<br/>\nand more shrewdness about where dolls might be located are the ones who get<br/>\nthe dolls.  When there&#39;s not enough food, the critters who are better able<br/>\nto locate, move to, and utilize the energy sources in the environment are<br/>\nthe ones who will be more likely get the energy they need to survive and<br/>\nreproduce.  Because there is variation in the population (part (a) of this<br/>\nargument), whatever biological or behavioral variations make their owners<br/>\nlucky enough to get more bananas than the guy next door, well, those are the<br/>\nones you&#39;ll see more of in the next generation, because the guy next door<br/>\n*died*.  There isn&#39;t room for everyone to win.  Again, no one disputes this<br/>\nmathematical law.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the basic cycle of natural selection.  Two mathematical laws and a<br/>\nthermodynamic law, none of which are in dispute in any even remotely<br/>\nscientific circles.  Repeat the cycle a few million times, and the<br/>\npopulation gradually refines to be better able to take advantage of whatever<br/>\nresources are available.  All sorts of weird things show up (both complex<br/>\nstructures and complex behaviors), but it didn&#39;t take either a God or a<br/>\nWatchmaker or an inscrutable space alien to make them show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why don&#39;t we get watches and Mount Rushmores appearing out of nowhere?<br/>\nBecause metal bits and rocks don&#39;t have self-replicating machinery.  Those<br/>\ncritters that *do* have self-replicating machinery *do* in fact have watches<br/>\n(as you know when you feel jet-lagged flying across time zones), not to<br/>\nmention calendars (as you know when you see geese flying south for the<br/>\nwinter), and funny faces (like the Japanese crabs with angry samurai faces<br/>\non their shells (which Carl Sagan showed in the classic Cosmos videos) as<br/>\nwell as countless species of fish and butterflies).  Indeed, those watches,<br/>\ncalendars, and funny faces could *easily* have arisen through the process of<br/>\nnatural selection.  Once you have the ability to self-replicate, the whole<br/>\nrest of the game follows without your being able to stop it.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) Proponents of creationism, er, intelligent design theory often say that<br/>\nwe have no experimental evidence to show this process occurring.  When<br/>\npressed with evidence of real-time observable evolution such as the obvious<br/>\nchanges in bacterial antibiotic resistance in recent decades, the change in<br/>\nfrequency of dark and light morphs of the peppered moth during the<br/>\nIndustrial Revolution, and cute examples like the samurai crabs, they<br/>\nbacktrack.  They choose some complex structure, such as the flagellum<br/>\nmentioned by your guest today, and state without proof that it is too<br/>\ncomplex to have arisen without an intelligent designer, and further state<br/>\nwithout reference to the scientific literature that there is no scientific<br/>\nevidence to support any possibility of its having arisen by chance.<br/>\n<br/>\n(a) Actually, cytoskeletal structures like flagella are tremendously simple;<br/>\nmuch of their apparently complex structure and behavior arises through very<br/>\nsimple mathematical laws (which I will be happy to explain if you are<br/>\ninterested).  In fact, most biological structures are surprisingly simple<br/>\nand inevitable when you look at them with a mathematical eye.  The classic<br/>\nbook in this area is &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; by d&#39;Arcy Wentworth Thompson.<br/>\nEven the abridged version is rather thick reading, but you might try reading<br/>\n&quot;Life&#39;s Devices&quot; or the even easier &quot;Cat&#39;s Paws and Catapults,&quot; both by<br/>\nSteven Vogel.<br/>\n<br/>\n(b) In computer science, self-replicating computer programs with initially<br/>\nrandom code have been shown to evolve through natural selection.  Not only<br/>\ndo we see increased efficiency in their use of system resources, but we also<br/>\nsee complex behaviors such as predation, parasitism, cooperation, betrayal,<br/>\nsexual reproduction (one of the best ways nature has found to increase the<br/>\nvariability in the population and hence speed a population&#39;s evolution!),<br/>\nand so forth, all arising by chance.  It&#39;s wild.  If you want to learn more<br/>\nabout this, do a search on the topic &quot;artificial life&quot; on the web, or read<br/>\nthe book, &quot;Artificial Life&quot; by Steven Levy or the many other books on the<br/>\ntopic.  They&#39;re quite readable.<br/>\n<br/>\n(c) In the test tube, biochemists are doing experiments to answer the<br/>\nquestion of whether living critters could evolve from nonliving Campbell&#39;s<br/>\nPrimordial Soup purely by the mathematical process of natural selection.<br/>\nYou think that scientists are satisfied with only studying life as it<br/>\nexists, without caring about how it got started?  Don&#39;t be silly.  The field<br/>\nis currently called &quot;astrobiology,&quot; because many of the scientists are<br/>\ntrying to figure out how likely it might be that intelligent life has<br/>\nevolved on other planets as well as trying to figure out how it might have<br/>\nstarted here.  Take a look at www.astrobiology.com or<br/>\nwww.astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov to get the basics and to meet some of the key<br/>\nplayers.  Here are some of the kicker experiments.  Jack Szostak started<br/>\nwith random short RNA molecules (which could plausibly have existed in the<br/>\nsoup), and showed that natural selection alone produced a population which<br/>\ncould draw energy from nucleotide triphosphates (the universal energy<br/>\ncurrency for life today) and which could use that energy to join together<br/>\noligonucleotides into longer chains.  In 2001, scientists at MIT used<br/>\ntest-tube evolution to produce a form of RNA that can reproduce itself with<br/>\n95% accuracy.  Other scientists have had plenty of success using test-tube<br/>\nevolution to select for various resource usage and other important<br/>\nbehaviors.  And folks are homing on on how those nucleotides could have<br/>\narisen in the first place through random chemical reactions that could<br/>\nreasonably have occurred on the early Earth.  In other words, science *has*<br/>\na plausible answer to the question, one that we are actively testing and<br/>\nrefining.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more we learn about life, the more it looks like it&#39;s a mathematical<br/>\ncertainty for life to occur, even in the harshest environments.  We don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to imagine a God or a friendly space alien or a soul of the universe<br/>\n(where did *they* come from, anyway?) to have plausible and testable<br/>\nscientific hypotheses about how life could have evolved from nonlife.  We<br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t need to give equal classroom time to so-called &quot;theories&quot;<br/>\nthat have no more scientific status than the &quot;theory&quot; that there&#39;s a little<br/>\nman hiding in the Coke machine dispensing soda.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll living critters are caught up in a mathematical cycle: they replicate,<br/>\nthe replications have variations, the variations make them more or less able<br/>\nto compete for resources, which affects how likely the different varieties<br/>\nare to be able to replicate in the next cycle.  It&#39;s not really something<br/>\nthat you can escape from unless you start positing an all-powerful Supreme<br/>\nBeing who tampers with things and tries to trick you into believing in<br/>\nevolution when it&#39;s actually false.  However, God is not a testable<br/>\nhypothesis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the reasons people have a hard time accepting evolution is<br/>\nbecause of the amazing variety of structures and functions which are present<br/>\nin the many varied ecosystems of this planet.  It *is* truly amazing, and<br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s hard to imagine that sort of variety and excellence of design<br/>\nwithout imagining a watchmaker.  It&#39;s hard to imagine because our everyday<br/>\nexperience doesn&#39;t lead us to much understanding of large numbers (read the<br/>\nexcellent book _Innumeracy_ by John Allen Paulos), but when you&#39;re more<br/>\ncomfortable with the large numbers involved, it becomes a lot easier to see<br/>\nhow things that look intelligently designed could in fact have come about<br/>\nthrough a very long process of chance.  (To refute one of the more common<br/>\narguments, more and more, scientists are demonstrating how partially-formed<br/>\nversions of things (for instance, an insect wing that wasn&#39;t strong enough<br/>\nto permit actual flight) could still confer a selective advantage (for<br/>\ninstance, by allowing the bug to skitter very fast across the surface of the<br/>\nwater)).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, how does that fit in with the Biblical version of creation?  It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve heard lots of people suggest that if you simply redefine the<br/>\nlength of a &quot;day,&quot; then everything&#39;s fine.  But it&#39;s not.  Things get<br/>\ncreated in completely the wrong order.  It&#39;s a nice idea, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nreally match with what science is pretty darned sure of.  Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, hard-nosed scientist hat off, spiritual hat on.  When I learn of a new<br/>\nscientific discovery which shows me more of the incredible beauty and<br/>\ndiversity that has created itself according to the incredibly simple<br/>\nmathematical laws of the cosmos, I am moved to say a blessing to God who set<br/>\nsuch a wondrous self-creating system in motion.  Frankly, I am *more*<br/>\nimpressed by a God who built a self-creating system than I am by the image<br/>\nof someone with a whole lot of Tinker Toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid things come about the way the Bible says?  Of course not.  Is it true?<br/>\nAbsolutely.  There&#39;s a big difference.  Mythological stories are the way we<br/>\ntell ourselves about our world and ourselves, and they can have deep truth<br/>\nto them without needing to have even a shred of literal truth.  Figure out<br/>\nwhat you can learn about the world and your place within it from this text<br/>\nand from what other people have said about it over the centuries -- that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat&#39;s important about the story, not whether creation started on a Thursday<br/>\nor a Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Aimee Yermish<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ayermish@...\">ayermish@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46467,"nextTopicId":46625}}
