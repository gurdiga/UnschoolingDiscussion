At stores sometimes I would just hold out a handful <br/>\nof money.  Holly would know what they had said and pick out the right coins, <br/>\nand give the proper response as we left.  The short little &quot;maybe I help you&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;thanks&quot; kinds of phrases were the hardest of all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to interpret, in college, when my friends from Texas or rural New <br/>\nMexico would be trying to converse with kids from Boston or New Jersey.  Some <br/>\nphrases would go RIGHT on by, unintelligible.  &quot;There&#39;s a horse in the yard&quot; <br/>\n(with Boston accent) meant NOTHING here (neither did the horse in the yard <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;).   &quot;We went for a film and a pie&quot; had to be translated to &quot;movies and a <br/>\npizza.&quot;    My boyfriend (from India via Toronto and Summit NJ) got in endless <br/>\nloop with my granny in Texas with her &quot;Come again?&quot; and his &quot;Pardon?&quot;  I came <br/>\nin about the third round and saved them both.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got in trouble in a pub, ordering Red Bull and vodka (the current popular <br/>\ndrink among young people, they said), because when they asked how I wanted it <br/>\nI said &quot;whatever&#39;s common.&quot;  All came to a hush and my American friend said, <br/>\n&quot;Say customary or normal, not &#39;common&#39;.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  Ooops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18389,"nextTopicId":18501}}
