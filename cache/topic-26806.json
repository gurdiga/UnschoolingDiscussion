The Catholic School I attended got out very early;  and<br/>\nwhen I got home,  my mom was watching her *faves* - As the World Turns,  and<br/>\nGuiding Light.  I usually caught some if ATWT,  and all of GL.  In college,<br/>\nwe had groups who&#39;d race to the lounge to get the TV to watch GL and it&#39;s<br/>\ncompetition, GH.<br/>\nAs an adult,  I started watching them during little ones naps when I began<br/>\nworking PT.  I&#39;m amazed to see many of the same actors as when I was a<br/>\nkidlet!  For me they&#39;re funny storylines,  but interesting studies in human<br/>\nbehavior  (My degree is in Psychology!!).  I do find them to be<br/>\naddictive...so this year I gave them up for Lent.  (Yes, I am a practicing<br/>\nCatholic)  For those of you who think this is a goofy tradition...I just<br/>\nwanna say,   it broke my bad habit and enabled me to replace it with more<br/>\npositive things....i.e.,  time with children,  time to relax,  time to read<br/>\nfor myself.<br/>\nAnyhow,.....that&#39;s my long answer to why.  I&#39;ll turn it on occassionally<br/>\nnow,  just to clue in on the storyline...I usually love the spooky<br/>\nstorylines they come up with around Halloween and the Nov. sweeps....I find<br/>\nit all amusing and imaginative.....as long as I can keep it from becoming a<br/>\nhabit that blocks me from loving myself and my family!<br/>\nSuz</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26718,"nextTopicId":26794}}
