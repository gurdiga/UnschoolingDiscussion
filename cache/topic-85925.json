That doesn&#39;t seem to be a good way to foster trust. Have<br/>\n&gt; you used<br/>\n&gt; &gt; punishments and coercion in the past as a way to enforce certain<br/>\n&gt; behaviors?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hope they don&#39;t read this list - your secret may be out.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Robyn L. Coburn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No,  these aren&#39;t planned punishments... we don&#39;t use punishments per<br/>\n&gt; say... someone asked what would happen if I found one of my children<br/>\n&gt; was having sex and that was my response. And that would probably be<br/>\n&gt; what I would do, I&#39;m not really sure. Yes, sex is dangerous ... as a<br/>\n&gt; matter of fact, when I donated blood two weeks ago they asked me all<br/>\n&gt; sorts of questions about my sex life - one episode of sex in certain<br/>\n&gt; circumstances makes my blood unsafe to donate. It can put me at risk<br/>\n&gt; for serious life threatening diseases, which can spread through the<br/>\n&gt; donation of blood. My dear friend who had sex three times ended up<br/>\n&gt; with a lifetime of STD problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have to admit that we are a family who has instilled these morals<br/>\n&gt; in our children to the best of our ability - through example and<br/>\n&gt; education, not coercion. They are free to learn about what the &quot;other<br/>\n&gt; side&quot; teaches as well and come to their own decisions. For the most<br/>\n&gt; part they have agreed with us - we do not coerce nor threaten nor<br/>\n&gt; bribe. My one reaction to the question was in earnest... I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; what I&#39;d do if I found one of my kids having sex, but it would be<br/>\n&gt; similar to what I&#39;d do if I found one playing Russian Roulette. I<br/>\n&gt; would do everything in my power to stop it, because I feel that<br/>\n&gt; strongly that sex can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable<br/>\n&gt; teenagers. Of course it&#39;s dangerous for adults too, but that&#39;s why I<br/>\n&gt; believe in and practice monogamy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are unschoolers. We have never &quot;required&quot; anything (except respect<br/>\n&gt; for each other!) We don&#39;t have curricula or schedules ... our kids<br/>\n&gt; choose all their own learning methods and subjects and tools. I have<br/>\n&gt; always been a believer in real life learning. 17 years ago when I<br/>\n&gt; started, I tried a curriculum - that lasted about a half a day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We do go to church, and the kids are free to come or not, as they<br/>\n&gt; choose. Until the oldest turned 19, he chose to come. At 19 he chose<br/>\n&gt; to not come. That&#39;s his choice and there were no &quot;parent imposed&quot;<br/>\n&gt; consequences. Soon after he moved out, into an apt, and within two<br/>\n&gt; years graduated with a degree in INM and has a fabulous job in<br/>\n&gt; Phoenix.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe with sex I feel more stongly and impose a little more of my<br/>\n&gt; beliefs, but I can&#39;t not do something I feel that strongly about. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think minors should be having sex. (A lot of adults probably<br/>\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t either!) But once the kids are &quot;of age&quot; it&#39;s their choice.<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t let a child beat up a sibling either. Or break windows...<br/>\n&gt; I dunno, maybe because I have this &quot;hangup&quot; about sex being sacred<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not really an unshcooler. But I doubt it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I think respect means respecting oneself also.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Janet in MN<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussion-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Visit the Unschooling website and message boards:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

And that would probably be <br/>\nwhat I would do, I&#39;m not really sure. Yes, sex is dangerous ... as a <br/>\nmatter of fact, when I donated blood two weeks ago they asked me all <br/>\nsorts of questions about my sex life - one episode of sex in certain <br/>\ncircumstances makes my blood unsafe to donate. It can put me at risk <br/>\nfor serious life threatening diseases, which can spread through the <br/>\ndonation of blood. My dear friend who had sex three times ended up <br/>\nwith a lifetime of STD problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit that we are a family who has instilled these morals <br/>\nin our children to the best of our ability - through example and <br/>\neducation, not coercion. They are free to learn about what the &quot;other <br/>\nside&quot; teaches as well and come to their own decisions. For the most <br/>\npart they have agreed with us - we do not coerce nor threaten nor <br/>\nbribe. My one reaction to the question was in earnest... I don&#39;t know <br/>\nwhat I&#39;d do if I found one of my kids having sex, but it would be <br/>\nsimilar to what I&#39;d do if I found one playing Russian Roulette. I <br/>\nwould do everything in my power to stop it, because I feel that <br/>\nstrongly that sex can be dangerous, especially for vulnerable <br/>\nteenagers. Of course it&#39;s dangerous for adults too, but that&#39;s why I <br/>\nbelieve in and practice monogamy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are unschoolers. We have never &quot;required&quot; anything (except respect <br/>\nfor each other!) We don&#39;t have curricula or schedules ... our kids <br/>\nchoose all their own learning methods and subjects and tools. I have <br/>\nalways been a believer in real life learning. 17 years ago when I <br/>\nstarted, I tried a curriculum - that lasted about a half a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do go to church, and the kids are free to come or not, as they <br/>\nchoose. Until the oldest turned 19, he chose to come. At 19 he chose <br/>\nto not come. That&#39;s his choice and there were no &quot;parent imposed&quot; <br/>\nconsequences. Soon after he moved out, into an apt, and within two <br/>\nyears graduated with a degree in INM and has a fabulous job in <br/>\nPhoenix.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe with sex I feel more stongly and impose a little more of my <br/>\nbeliefs, but I can&#39;t not do something I feel that strongly about. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think minors should be having sex. (A lot of adults probably <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t either!) But once the kids are &quot;of age&quot; it&#39;s their choice. <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t let a child beat up a sibling either. Or break windows... <br/>\nI dunno, maybe because I have this &quot;hangup&quot; about sex being sacred <br/>\nI&#39;m not really an unshcooler. But I doubt it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think respect means respecting oneself also.<br/>\n<br/>\nJanet in MN</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Nearly gone","postDate":"1071027827","msgId":85962,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRhLjI1N2NkNjdmLjJkMDdmMDczQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":85954,"nextInTopic":85968,"prevInTime":85961,"nextInTime":85963,"topicId":85925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-527238802\">&lt;&lt;In a message dated 12/9/2003 8:37:23 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:Ask them for a seat belt extension!<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n*****************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that a real item?
