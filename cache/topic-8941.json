To be in a place where the whole world homeschools was \nwonderful!!!&nbsp; We have a friend who graduated, so we attended some of the \ngraduation ( we had to leave early to drive home since we had a wedding on \nSunday--we got home at 1 AM). My oldest dd--almost 12--thought the graduation \nwas so cool. Family members &amp;/or</div>\n<div>others the child graduating asks, come to the podium with the graduate and \neveryone has the opportunity to speak. There were tables where kids could \ndisplay a project of their choosing--education in action!&nbsp; My oldest did a \nproject on body language and horses (her passion) and my youngest did one on \nRussia.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;My dh attended an intense session with Joseph Chilton Pearce--more on \nthat later after he&#39;s digested it and after I read some of his books.</div>\n<div>&nbsp; I am more and more convinced that this path we have chosen for the \npast 7 yrs is so right.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;By the way, on Sunday, my almost 12 dd asked what algebra is. Then \nshe told us she wants to learn it.&nbsp; My younger dd(8) wants to learn the \nhistory of our house (it is very old!) and to learn what has happened in the \nworld since it has been built. She is intrigued by Harriet Tubman and the \nUndrsground RR and wonders if our house could have been a stop... When&nbsp;I \ncalled the library to see what kind of resources they have, the librarian asked \nme how old my child is--when I told her that Hannah is 8, she said&quot;Isn&#39;t that a \nlittle young?...&quot;</div>\n<div>&nbsp; Debra</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8936,"nextTopicId":8942}}
