One of the dangers with &quot;imposing&quot; a viewpoint on children is that you leave yourself <br/>\nlittle room to evolve or grow. Kids take what their parents say and do as true - right, <br/>\ncorrect, logical. Ask any child who to vote for in the next election and the name of the <br/>\nparents&#39; choice will pop out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults spend time choosing their beliefs. They make decisions about health, politics, the <br/>\nenvironment, education and religion based on reading, life experience, dialog, facts and, <br/>\nlet&#39;s face it, their personal neuroses! &lt;g&gt; So often we think that once we have come to our <br/>\npersonal belief conclusions, that we&#39;ve &quot;arrived&quot; at some point of clarity or insight that is <br/>\nimmovable or will remain correct for... ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we short circuit the process of investigation or exploration for our kids, telling them <br/>\nwhat took us years to &quot;conclude,&quot; and we get a little testy or anxious when our kids don&#39;t <br/>\nautomatically understand things the way we do (or we take undeserved pride in a child <br/>\nwho &quot;turns down sugar&quot; as though he did that for the same set of reasons we don&#39;t eat <br/>\nsugar).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what happens when one day we realize: &quot;Hey, I no longer believe that&quot;? What if <br/>\nsomeone changes faiths, stops believing that the rain forests are being depleted by my <br/>\nfast food habit, decides not to be vegetarian any more, changes from traditional schooling <br/>\nto unschooling, goes back to work after staying home, uses a bottle in addition to breast <br/>\nfeeding?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens to kids who have been told repeatedly what is right and what is wrong, only <br/>\nto have a parent change her mind?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey become disoriented because they haven&#39;t developed a philosophy that says they <br/>\nmust grow, change and decide for themselves, too.
