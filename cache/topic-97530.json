If they are weaned later than this, they remain much too connected with the <br/>\nmaternal forces of inheritance and become over-dependent upon these forces. We <br/>\ncan readily understand this statement made by Rudolf Steiner. At the end of <br/>\nits first half year, the child is already trying to sit up. In this striving, <br/>\nas will be more fully explained later, those forces of uprightness show <br/>\nthemselves that are working in the baby. They are a sign of how the individuality is <br/>\ntaking possession of the physical body. At six months, the child may reach <br/>\nsuch a stage of development that it can to a certain extent free itself from the <br/>\nforces of inheritance. This freedom is most easily achieved in the domain of <br/>\nnutrition. At half a year the child is able to digest other than the mother&#39;s <br/>\nmilk without any difficulty. Besides this, observation teaches us that the <br/>\nchild who remains too long at the breast comes to resemble its parent closely. In <br/>\nthe past, when people loved to see in a child the image of its mother, <br/>\nchildren were still given the breast, even when they could already run about. Among <br/>\npeasants and gypsies this was the usual thing - and may still be.&quot;<br/>\nSource: Conception Birth & Early Childhood, Norbert Glas, M.D., <br/>\nAnthroposophic Press, Inc., Spring Valley, NY, 1972, pp.41-42.<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....  <br/>\nThis guy and his followers thought children looked like their mothers becuase <br/>\nthey nursed too long??  I guess he ignored physical resemblance in kids <br/>\nadopted out, or bottlefed?   So teaching this made-up kind of science is as crazy <br/>\nas some of the revisionist kind of science and history taught in some of the <br/>\nhomeschooling curriculae of the Christian homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s embarrassing when it&#39;s homeschooling.

He is not in a class, but we do circle songs, bake bread & make soup, <br/>\ncut vegetables, wet on wet paint, and do many of the things that I know do go <br/>\non in the kindergarten setting. The children he plays with are all in the <br/>\nWaldorf school. He is a happy, well adjusted and friendly little boy. Very well <br/>\nrounded and very smart!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-It is my belief, that whether a child is fed from the breast, bottle, or <br/>\nspoon, it is important to look at the whole picture before making wild <br/>\nassumptions about developmental or character flaws and blaming it on breastfeeding, <br/>\nco-family sleeping, eating grains, or meats, wearing red or yellow, sleeping <br/>\nupstairs or downstairs, etc. It seems purely ridiculous to me. And has anyone <br/>\neven considered temperament in labeling and behavioral problems?<br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n(Off to see what wearing red or yellow or sleeping upstairs or downstairs is <br/>\nsupposed to do.
