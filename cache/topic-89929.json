My Husband and our 7 children (2 1/2 to 17 years old)  live in the South Bay area of California and our home is about 15 minutes from LAX international airport, so LA is where we hang.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only do I have a couple other suggestion to add to the other great L.A. vacation ideas that have been posted, but I would also be very happy to help assist you all while in the Southern California area.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA DAY AT REDONDO BEACH BY THE PIER<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.redondopier.com/photogallery/2003/kitefestival/\">http://www.redondopier.com/photogallery/2003/kitefestival/</a><br/>\nAdmission: Free<br/>\nThis would be my first choice for a must do.  (Very Californian!!!)    Playing with the kids, feeling the Pacific breeze, and the sound of the surf.   This particular beach, by the pier,  is a relatively low surf area so it is great for young kids to play in.    If you decide you want to do this, let us join you and we will bring the sand toys & shovels,  kites,  snorkeling masks, boogie boards, towels and munchies.  Just tell us what day and we will be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nCALIFORNIA SCIENCE CENTER IN EXPOSITION PARK<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.casciencectr.org/\">http://www.casciencectr.org/</a><br/>\nEven though admission is free our family purchases an annual membership because we love going there and want to support this institution.    There are a lot of hands on science exhibits for all ages.   We never get tired of going.   Our techno boys always find lots to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOS ANGELES NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN EXPOSITION PARK<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhm.org/\">http://www.nhm.org/</a><br/>\nAdmission: Adults $9.00   Children 5 - 12 $2.00<br/>\nThe Children&#39;s Discovery Center has a great insect zoo.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhm.org/education/discoverycenter/index.html\">http://www.nhm.org/education/discoverycenter/index.html</a>  <br/>\nAnd if you want to get an understanding of California History, the basement of the museum is dedicated to the history of Los Angeles, California and the United States. <br/>\n   <br/>\nAlso, from May - August there is a live free-flying butterfly exhibit in an outdoor pavilion that is pure wonderment.    About 20+ different varieties of butterflies flutter about as you walk through this beautiful outdoor sanctuary. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/butterflies/slideshow.html\">http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/butterflies/slideshow.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCABRILLO MARINE AQUARIUM IN SAN PEDRO <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cabrilloaq.org/\">http://www.cabrilloaq.org/</a><br/>\nAdmission is a donation.   <br/>\nThis is another place that is fun because it has a touching tide pool and other interesting displays.    Also, after exploring the museum, there is a fun playground nearby that we enjoy visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC IN LONG BEACH<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/index.html\">http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/index.html</a><br/>\nAdults $21.00  Children $12.00<br/>\nMy parents always give our family an annual pass for Christmas every year because they know how much we love going.   The multiple aquarium displays of different seas through out the world are breath taking and the Sting-ray touching pool and the shark touching pool are family favorites. <br/>\nNearby the Museum are some travel boats businesses that give 1 hour tours of the Long Beach Harbor area.<br/>\n<br/>\nKNOTTS BERRY FARM<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.knotts.com/\">http://www.knotts.com/</a><br/>\nAdults $43.00 Children $12.95  (Promotional discount ticket are available through local grocery stores periodically)<br/>\nEven though we love Disneyland we also like Knotts Berry Farm Amusement Park.   It has a fun Western California Theme and it is a lot less expensive than Disneyland.   My husband&#39;s parents give our family members Annual passes for Christmas.   <br/>\n<br/>\n(We often receive memberships or annual passes due to the fact that we live in a small 3 bedroom house.   It is easier to organize and store cards than it is to store  lots of toys for Christmas.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope that we are able to get together while you are in the area.   Let me know if there is anything I can do to make your stay here in Southern California a wonderful and memorable experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxanne Trimper<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Trimpertribe@...\">Trimpertribe@...</a><br/>\nMom to Christiana Joy (14) SSHD, ileosotomy<br/>\nJacob, 17<br/>\nJeremiah, 10<br/>\nJosiah, 9<br/>\nJuliana, 7<br/>\nLauriana, 4<br/>\nAlicana, 2 1/2<br/>\nWife to Jon<br/>\nTorrance, California USA<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;A child is a natural product.
