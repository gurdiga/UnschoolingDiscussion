When we first arrived <br/>\nthere, we  stayed in a hotel for a few weeks.  Instead of a big double <br/>\nbed,  there were 2 single beds with wooden frames around them, and they <br/>\nwere  pushed together.  But it wasn&#39;t really like a big bed because <br/>\nthere  was wood in the middle!  And instead of disgusting hotel <br/>\nbedspreads  that rarely get washed here in the U.S., they had down <br/>\ncomforters and  changed the comforter covers every day.  They hung the <br/>\ncomforters out  of the (unscreened) windows to air them out.  You could <br/>\nsee  comforters hanging out of windows all over the place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beds used to DRIVE US CRAZY!!!! We lived in Germany for 7  years.  Also, <br/>\nTupperware, European Tupperware is all very very small sized  oriented.  <br/>\nUnique, but small.  We&#39;d call the soda delivery and they&#39;d  deliver cases of cola, <br/>\nspezi, and several other flavors right to our door,  anytime.  We&#39;d pay our <br/>\nmonthly bill.  Pizzas were large rectangles,  not circles.  The layout of apts <br/>\nwas confusing.  In one apt we rented,  you had to walk through absolutely every <br/>\nroom of the house to get to the  bathroom.   I loved watching the weddings, <br/>\nwe lived across the street  from a church.
