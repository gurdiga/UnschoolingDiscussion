I am involved in a community<br/>\nservice project called the Afghan Project.  The purpose is to supply a<br/>\npersonalized afghan to foster children.  There are 10, 000 foster children<br/>\nin Mass. and I have helped personalize nearly 600.  I have an on line<br/>\nnewsletter which I send out each month looking for help. I also would like<br/>\nto get other states involved.  I would like to do this through home<br/>\nschoolers or 4-H.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal goal is to help give 200 foster kids an afghan this year. You<br/>\ncan help me with this goal in many ways.<br/>\nIf you do not knit or crochet you could:<br/>\n1. Donate:<br/>\n     1. usable afghans<br/>\n     2. washable 4 ply acrylic yarn<br/>\n     3. knitting needles or crochet hooks<br/>\n2. Make afghans - knit or crochet - any size - any color<br/>\n3. create 6&quot; squares<br/>\n  for knitters:  cast on 20 stitches and straight knit until 6  inches (can<br/>\ndo patterns but prefer not the stockinette (knit a row, purl a row)<br/>\n  crochet any 6&quot; square<br/>\n4. repair donated afghans<br/>\n5. assemble afghans<br/>\n     1. sew together squares<br/>\n     2. add borders<br/>\n     3. personalize afghans<br/>\n6. prepare afghans for delivery (decorate bags, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways to help me with this project and I would appreciate<br/>\nanything you could do.  I also could come talk to a small group that might<br/>\nbe interested in learning more about this project.

We&#39;ll feature a question and comments in each issue<br/>\nof NHENotes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time we asked:<br/>\nHow do you feel about homeschoolers participating in extracurricular<br/>\nactivities at public schools?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of your responses:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am torn on this issue.  I think it depends on how intrusive the public<br/>\nschool system is when the homeschooler uses the service. --Nance<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think that if I homeschooled then I should not have access to the<br/>\nactivities at the schools then I realized that I do pay taxes and should<br/>\nhave every right if I so choose.<br/>\n--Laurie<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not in favor - the further we stay away from government run services,<br/>\nthe freer we shall be. --Shannon<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t want to take part in any activities our public schools<br/>\noffer to homeschoolers. I think this would open the door to the school<br/>\nofficials sticking their noses in our schooling. If I wanted the district to<br/>\nbe involved in my children&#39;s education, I would have kept them in the public<br/>\nschools! I believe it would eventually  compromise my freedom as a<br/>\nhomeschool parent to utilize the public schools extracurricular<br/>\nactivities --Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nMy county is very welcoming to homeschoolers inviting them to participate. I<br/>\nfeel this is a good thing. Our taxes pay for these activities, and if<br/>\nsomeone chooses to put their child in band or sports,I think they should be<br/>\nallowed to. --Pat<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI will not tell others how to raise their children, and I can&#39;t fault<br/>\nparents who are doing what they think is best. However, I will not use the<br/>\nservices of the public schools, because I think that, even if there are no<br/>\nproblems at the outset, it invites closer scrutiny and possible regulation<br/>\nof homeschools when they entangle themselves with tax-funded schools. There<br/>\nare many other worthwhile opportunites for us that do not present such<br/>\ncomplications. --Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son plays on the high school soccer team and at this time it&#39;s the only<br/>\nway possible for him to get the competition he needs with other players who<br/>\nplay at the same level. It has never been a problem for us and the athletic<br/>\ndepartment has been outstanding in their support...what it all boils down to<br/>\nfor me, is that this is a personal choice made by my son, who is passionate<br/>\nabout his sport. Arbitrary arguments about whether or not this is the<br/>\n&quot;politically correct&quot; homeschooling choice doesn&#39;t enter into it. For him,<br/>\nhis love of the game and his commitment to his sport is all that matters and<br/>\nI will always support him in his choice.<br/>\n--Cindie<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as there are no governmental strings attached, sure!  Why not?<br/>\nWouldn&#39;t it be great if the public school could serve as a community<br/>\nresource rather than insist upon maintaining a stronghold on all those<br/>\nparticipating in its programs?  Until that happens our family will forgo,<br/>\nhowever. --Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder no circumstances should homeschoolers participate in Public school<br/>\nactivities. This sends a two sided message. We do not want the government to<br/>\nregulate homeschool yet we want to participate in government run schools.<br/>\nAny contact with the public school in this day and age opens up<br/>\nhomeschoolers to government invasion. Many times children are only able to<br/>\nparticipate based on test scores.  It would be much more beneficial for<br/>\nhomeschoolers to band together and get leagues going on their own...When<br/>\nhomeschoolers participate in public school activities we send the message<br/>\nthat we approve of the school system and that we cannot function without<br/>\nit...There are always strings attached and no matter how enticing the offer<br/>\nthere are still consequences. Unfortunately many do not look at the whole<br/>\npicture...Be sure you understand the implications by participating in public<br/>\nschool activities of any kind. --Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s fine as long as it is very clear that the programs and<br/>\nactivities are public school activities, not public school activities billed<br/>\nas &quot;homeschooling&quot; activities. Tough balancing act on this one! --Christine<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nThe typical objection I encounter revolves around the homeschooler taking up<br/>\na &quot;slot&quot;, thereby denying some other student the position. My usual answer<br/>\ncenters around having provided the same funding (taxes & fees) as any other<br/>\nparticipant, and subjecting oneself to inferior education should not be a<br/>\nprerequisite to participating in something paid for. --Bob<br/>\n<br/>\n====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to add your opinion, you can find the current Hot Topics<br/>\nat: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/newsletter/hottopics.html\">http://www.nhen.org/newsletter/hottopics.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n    FUNDRAISING<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nNHEN T-SHIRTS & TOTES!
