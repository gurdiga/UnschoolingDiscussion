How many Apples are <br/>\nthere total?<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Math:  Bob went to the market and purchased 2 Apples for 50 cents.  <br/>\nJane went to the market and purchased 2 Apples for 78 cents.  How many <br/>\nApples did both Bob and Jane purchase at the market today?<br/>\n<br/>\nToday&#39;s Math:  Bob left San Jose on Saturday at 3:15 PM to ride a train <br/>\nat 50 Mph heading west along the equator towards El Salvador.  After <br/>\nvisiting the currency exchange office on Mejuan Street across from the <br/>\nSt. Maria bakery owned by Enrico Sanchez, he left at 4:46 PM via <br/>\nHandora&#39;s Taxi service heading south at 27 Mph to make it to the annual <br/>\nweekend farmer&#39;s market.  After walking approximately 1 hour and 15 <br/>\nminutes at 2 Mph through the farmer&#39;s market, his Russian copy of a Timex <br/>\ndigital watch beeped repeatedly when 6:01 PM had passed.  Bob approached <br/>\nan open vendor and asked to purchase native 2 red apples, not imports, <br/>\nwith his recently exchanged currency.  Handing the farmer, Mr. Sojos, 37 <br/>\npesos in 4 bills and 3 coins, he received 2 native red apples that are <br/>\napproximately 3 hours 27 minutes old from the time they were picked.<br/>\n<br/>\nJane left New York on Monday at 1:52 PM on an American Airlines jet <br/>\nairplane traveling at an altitude of 12,372 feet, a speed of 572 Mph, <br/>\nwith a headwind of 38 Mph east along the equator towards South Africa.  <br/>\nAfter a grueling trip of 13 hours 7 minutes, she arrived at the Airport <br/>\nof South Africa in terminal A-22.  At a speed of approximately 3 Mph, she <br/>\nhurried to her expected limousine service owned and operated by Martin <br/>\nKalafent-Mefe, and arrived at 4:29 PM the next day.  After checking her <br/>\nRollex time piece she acquired as a gift from her great grandmother in <br/>\n1947 right after the war, it read 4:37 PM with a  crescent moon dial <br/>\nindicating the moon phase for the day.  After getting into her limousine <br/>\nat 4:42 PM, she ordered to be driven to the local market in South <br/>\nKabul-Afe.  At an average speed of 37 Mph, it took her 28 minutes 52 <br/>\nseconds to reach her destination.  Seeing that she already made a <br/>\ncurrency exchange for $2.73, she exited the vehicle 5:14 PM and <br/>\napproached a local apple vendor.  Jane asked to purchase 2 Washington <br/>\nimport apples at exactly 5:17 PM.  Mr. Obetafe, the owner of the apples, <br/>\nsold her 2 Washington import apples for $2.52.  Jane received 21 cents in <br/>\nthe form of 2 dimes and 1 penny as her change, and placed it in her left <br/>\npocket approximately 36 inches from the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the inflation percentage on New Hampshire colonial currency <br/>\nafter the French & Indian war disrupted tobacco exports to London in the <br/>\n18th century?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nKolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28812,"nextTopicId":29113}}
