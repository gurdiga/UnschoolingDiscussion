We&#39;ve built the<br/>\nsunflower/morning glory house several times...it is always beautiful!  We<br/>\nlove Sharon Lovejoy&#39;s books and have found some wonderful garden ideas in<br/>\nher books.  A couple of other good books are A Garden for Children by<br/>\nFelicity Bryan  and Magical Gardens (Myth,Mulch and Marigolds) by Patricia<br/>\nMonaghan.  When we built the sunflower house I had found a sunflower teapot<br/>\nwith cups to go with it and we would have tea or juice in our teapot...I<br/>\neven had a tablecloth to spread on the ground from sunflower fabric...Dd<br/>\nthought it was quite magical.<br/>\nAnother must have book is Cultivating Sacred Space: Gardening for the Soul<br/>\nby Elizabeth Murray...this book is beautiful and filled with lovely pictures<br/>\nof gardens, some with children. Murray talks about transforming our own<br/>\nprivate gardens into places that satisfy our need for the sacred, for play,<br/>\nfor meditation and for connecting with the earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are an unschooling family of a single daughter aged 12.  She has always<br/>\nunschooled except for a brief stint in a waldorf kindergarden.  It was her<br/>\nchoice to unschool.  She is involved in all sorts of things: she studies<br/>\nviolin with a woman that is also in a rock band called Band of Humans, rides<br/>\nhorses, snowboards, takes pottery class, watercolor paints with a magical<br/>\nwoman, and is on a youth competitive team for kungfu with her master being a<br/>\n2x chinese all around gongfu champion.  She competed in the internation<br/>\ncompetition for kungfu this past August and won two gold medals.  Before she<br/>\nstudied martial arts she was enrolled in a pre-professional ballet school in<br/>\nHartford, CT for 4 years.  Her ballet training has really helped with her<br/>\nmartial arts ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in CT on the edge of a 24,000 acre forest.  We keep a few chickens,<br/>\nhave a psychotic Border Collie and a very uppity cat.  We love sustainable<br/>\nliving, biodynamic gardening, alternative house structures (espec. cob<br/>\nhouses), folk music and contradancing, camping, drumming, bonfires and  the<br/>\nidea of creating community.  I am a licensed RN, Massage Therapist, Reiki<br/>\nMaster, Herbalist, and flower essence practitioner.  Dh is a master<br/>\nwoodworker/carpenter and would discuss history with anyone who has a minute.<br/>\nWe would love to find a way to create an eco-village with folks that have a<br/>\nsimilar interest!<br/>\nLooking forward to meeting others here in this forum.<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: Cindy Ferguson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would also love to build a sunflower/morning glory house.  You plant<br/>\n&gt; sunflower seeds around the perimeter of the house.  Then you plant<br/>\n&gt; morning glory seeds around each sunflower (6 or so).  The morning<br/>\n&gt; glories will climb up the sunflowers and you can weave them, if you<br/>\n&gt; want a more solid wall.  Then when it gets tall enough, you put<br/>\n&gt; string between the sunflowers to make a support for the roof (which<br/>\n&gt; is more morning glories).  I just wish I had room for all this!!<br/>\n&gt; Cindy Ferguson<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a> </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5877,"nextTopicId":5895}}
