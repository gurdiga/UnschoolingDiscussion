So if <br/>\nour 2 year olds, or 10 year olds are imitating us, it is in hopes of <br/>\nemulating us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all part of the same thing.  Why else would a child imitate if not to <br/>\nemulate.  When they get older we call it sharing interests, but it&#39;s the <br/>\nsame impulse.

I had told them the premise of the story (aliens whose main knowledge of <br/>\nearth culture was what they had seen of old B&W monster movies broadcast on TV <br/>\nbefore the mid-1960s).   <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly figured out this year (she&#39;s 12) that Frankenfurter was a man dressed <br/>\nas a woman (kind of).  It never mattered.  She was too young to pay attention <br/>\nto what wasn&#39;t interesting to her.  (And now she&#39;s too mature to pay attention <br/>\nto what&#39;s not interesting. LOL)   <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, one of her friends was forbidden to see ANY of that video until <br/>\nshe was 12.  &quot;Wait &#39;til you&#39;re 12.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so for all those years, Holly was humming some of the tunes, knowing who <br/>\nSusan Sarandon and Tim Curry were, paying more attention to Meatloaf when <br/>\nmusic or movies of his came around, and she and Marty once did a very cool <br/>\ncomparison of Rocky Horror and some other movie involving aliens.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t make them watch it, nor even encourage it.  I don&#39;t know whether <br/>\nKirby or Marty has even watched it all the way through in one pass.

And I&#39;m willing to risk that.  My choice.  But it&#39;s made with <br/>\nthe knowledge that I MIGHT miss something.  I respect my husband.  That <br/>\nmeans I assume he is getting something from watching that program.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what, &#39;cause I can&#39;t stand it.  Don&#39;t like South Park much either.  I <br/>\nthink I&#39;ve watched one I even found remotely funny.  Lots of people I <br/>\nrespect like it.  Love it.  Yuck.  Maybe if I gave it more time, watched it <br/>\nwith him, talked about it, I would get something from it.  Not worth it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut assuming that because I don&#39;t like it that it can&#39;t have value to him, <br/>\non his own, would be wrong.  Assuming that about a child--not matter their <br/>\nage, no matter the content--is wrong, too.

My point wasn&#39;t that you should.  My point was that by looking <br/>\nat a portion of what was going on--violent content, you are not looking at <br/>\nthe other parts of the program.  Now, you are fully in your rights to do <br/>\nthat.  But when you declare that another person won&#39;t see anything more <br/>\nthan that, that&#39;s when I had a problem with it.  I have a problem with it <br/>\nin PRINCIPLE.  Not in application to your children or to the original <br/>\nposter&#39;s children.  But because it sets up a situation where you could be <br/>\ndismissing a valid interest because you are assuming it does not exist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  &gt; I still think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that assuming the reason a child would be interested in a more<br/>\n&gt;mature<br/>\n&gt; &gt; program is only the parents interest is underestimating a child.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I disagree.<br/>\n&gt;2yo&#39;s often imitate their parents.

Is &quot;assuming&quot; that they were imitating me<br/>\n&gt;underestimating them in some way?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So because children imitate their parents at that age it is the only reason <br/>\nthat they are interested in things at that age?  This is what I hear you <br/>\nsaying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; And if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you do it when they are two, you might do it when they are 10.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I have a child past ten.<br/>\n&gt;He no longer pretends to nurse dolls or imitates the adults around<br/>\n&gt;him like he did at 2.  There wouldn&#39;t *be* a reason for me to<br/>\n&gt;imagine that when he wants to watch something he&#39;s just imitating me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So at 10 your children no longer look to you for things to emulate?

I can imagine a small child getting caught up in the &quot;soap opera&quot; <br/>\npart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is--we are not in our child&#39;s mind.  I&#39;m not so much arguing the <br/>\nrelative merit of the Sopranos, because, as we&#39;ve discussed, I haven&#39;t seen <br/>\nit.  I&#39;m wondering why the dismissal of &quot;a 2 year old wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\ninterested&quot; and not &quot;Talk to your child about the program, see if you can <br/>\nfigure out what it is that interests him, if it&#39;s just your interest that <br/>\nwill become clear, if it is something else, perhaps you can redirect him to <br/>\nsomething with the same appeal and no scary bits.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s all.  That&#39;s my point.  To not dismiss the child&#39;s interest as just <br/>\nbeing a reflection of the parent&#39;s interest but to consider going deeper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.<br/>\n&gt;Information<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taken out of context can be much more upsetting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think it&#39;s unfair to judge my judgement that a program isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;likely to be of interest to toddlers without having seen the program<br/>\n&gt;yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t.  I have no concrete opinion on the show.  Haven&#39;t seen it.  I <br/>\nCAN imagine reasons, other than parent&#39;s interest, why a child would be <br/>\ninterested in mature subjects.  Not in a scary, probably abused, <br/>\ninappropriate way, but in a genuine interest in, for example, personal <br/>\ninteraction.  Kids pick up on that stuff really well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I wonder if you watched a couple of episodes whether you&#39;d introduce<br/>\n&gt;them to *your* young child- watch them when he&#39;s around, place them<br/>\n&gt;within his access, talk them up to him, etc.  My guess is not.  (How<br/>\n&gt;old are your children by the way?)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What difference does it make what age my kids are?  (I&#39;ve already said in <br/>\nthis thread, btw.)  I HAVE introduced some very adult shows to my kids.  I <br/>\nwatch all kinds of things.  My eldest didn&#39;t like X-files at about the age <br/>\nwe are talking about and so I missed a couple seasons in first run.  Now I <br/>\nget to show them to him and he thinks they are cool.  He made it VERY clear <br/>\n(and he wasn&#39;t very verbal at 2) that he didn&#39;t like it.  Ok, fair enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I ask my husband not to watch the Dave Chappelle show around the <br/>\nkids.  First off, it&#39;s personal--I hate it and I&#39;m uncomfortable so <br/>\nI  don&#39;t get family time if it&#39;s on.  Second, I do think it&#39;s a bit icky to <br/>\nhave the kids listen to (lots of racial stereotypes, sex jokes, <br/>\netc.)  Third, the kids clearly don&#39;t get it and also have that sense of it <br/>\nnot being family time.  If they asked for it to be put back on, I&#39;d have to <br/>\nlook at why, try to figure it out.  Parental interest is ONE reason.  But I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t jump to the assumption that was the only reason.  (Though, God&#39;s, <br/>\nI&#39;d hope so, I hate it!!! -smile-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I also think it&#39;s unfair to judge a program by a few scenes.<br/>\n&gt;Information<br/>\n&gt; &gt; taken out of context can be much more upsetting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Who is it unfair to?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>IN THIS SETTING, the child.  You are assuming his/her interest is only <br/>\nbecause of the parent&#39;s interest.  With less than the whole show to go <br/>\non.  I&#39;m making no assumptions about the reasons, because I have no info <br/>\ndirectly on the show.  I am speculation another reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Why would I make myself continue to watch something that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;disturbing to me just so that I can judge it in its entirety?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you are making the decision just for you, no reason.  If you are a <br/>\nparent assessing a program in order to guide your child,  perhaps your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you might miss something interesting to you by not being willing to <br/>\nwork outside your comfort level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m really curious now... does anyone who *is* familiar with the<br/>\n&gt;Sopranos think it&#39;s appropriate to strew in front of a 2yo, and,<br/>\n&gt;having done that, that the 2yo would have a genuine desire to keep<br/>\n&gt;watching it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Patti<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m curious why it isn&#39;t clear that the point isn&#39;t the Sopranos.  It&#39;s <br/>\nany program that we are making a judgement about.  Our judgment may be <br/>\ncorrect.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt that yours WAS in that setting.  I still think <br/>\nthat assuming the reason a child would be interested in a more mature <br/>\nprogram is only the parents interest is underestimating a child.  And if <br/>\nyou do it when they are two, you might do it when they are 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about the idea, not the Sopranos and not that two year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: Age Appropriateness","postDate":"1092748833","msgId":98221,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ2LjExZjliOWRiLjJlNTM2MDIxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":98218,"nextInTopic":98231,"prevInTime":98220,"nextInTime":98222,"topicId":98163,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/16/2004 9:16:57 PM Central Standard Time, pamsoroosh@mac.com writes: LOR is  pretty gory and scary - but if a kid wanted to watch it I d","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1869543817\">In a message dated 8/16/2004 9:16:57 PM Central Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nLOR is  pretty gory and scary - but if a kid wanted to watch it I&#39;d put <br/>\nit on and  sit close and be sensitive to turning it off if they were too  <br/>\nscared.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\nWill and I watched it for the first time on cable just the other day.

My kids all wanted to<br/>\nsee it, especially the older two, and I told them not until they were much<br/>\nolder.  After reading about other people&#39;s experiences in letting their kids<br/>\nself-regulate, I decided to let them see it, but at home on DVD so we could<br/>\nstop or pause it if it was too much for them.  I was hoping that my<br/>\nsix-year-old wouldn&#39;t be interested and we could go off and play, but she<br/>\nwanted to see what the big deal was.  When we got to the first scary part<br/>\n(at least to me) when the Hobbits were all hiding off the road under the<br/>\ntree roots and the black horse things were looking for them (sorry I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember what they&#39;re called), I paused the movie and asked if everyone was<br/>\nO.K..  They were.  I asked my daughter if this was too scary for her.  She<br/>\nlooked at me in disbelief, and said, in a very patronizing tone, as if I<br/>\nwere simple:  &quot;Mom, IT&#39;S PRETEND.&quot;  And it is.  So we continued.  <br/>\nWe all saw the other two at the Theaters.  When Return of the King came out<br/>\nwe went to the late show on opening night in a college area.  All of the<br/>\ncollege kids chatting with us as we waited in line were asking how come they<br/>\nwere out so late on a school night, etc.  I think they got a little extra<br/>\neducation that night. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this works much better than my nieces who couldn&#39;t wait to see their<br/>\nfirst Pg movie, then their first Pg-13 movie.

Turns out she really loves that stuff anyway so we spend as much time going over the special features on effects on a DVD as we do watching a movie. I should have known, I loved monsters and knoing how they made them when I was little too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This is were I am conflicted.  I<br/>\n&gt;guess it would be better to give him the opportunity<br/>\n&gt;and be glad if he turns away after a couple minutes,<br/>\n&gt;but what if he likes it? <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter loves it. She&#39;s not an evil, violent head hunter now. She&#39;s interested in martial arts and making special effects. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know how comfortable<br/>\n&gt;I feel about exposing my child to those images and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;not sure how much I buy into, &quot;if I don&#39;t let him,<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;ll only be drawn to it more&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t offered up any reasons why your son seeing those movies would be bad other then you being uncomfortable which I think has nothing to do with why he shouldn&#39;t watch them and that he might freak out. I was terrified of the Brady Bunch for years because of one episode where one of the kids disapeared from inside a magic box. Many kids have freaked out at the flying monkey scenes in, &quot;the Wizard of Oz&#39;. &quot;Time Bandits&#39;, another kid flick, could turn my stomach but I still loved watching action and horror movies and had nary a nightmare. <br/>\nWhy would those movies be something to keep from him?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I don&#39;t know if he can separate &quot;pretend&quot; from<br/>\nreality yet.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why there are DVD&#39;s with special features. What better way to realize the orc heads are fake then to watch them make them? My daughter actually watched the spec. effects features first, now that I think about it. hat may have been a big help.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn (in NS)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Age Appropriateness","postDate":"1092720242","msgId":98200,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmczRwaStqZmFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMS4yLjAuMC4yMDA0MDgxNjIzNTkzMy4wMjYwYzJhMEBzbXRwLm1hYmIubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":98196,"nextInTopic":98202,"prevInTime":98199,"nextInTime":98201,"topicId":98163,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... program.
