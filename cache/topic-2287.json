(have to go the meeting, have to go <br/>\nto soccer practice, have to go make supper-- when they are indeed all <br/>\nchoices!!!!)  i was able to let go of much resentment towards the sacrifices <br/>\nthat come with marriage and mothering when i realized that i could freely and <br/>\nlovingly choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nerin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2284,"nextTopicId":2291}}
