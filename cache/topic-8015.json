But I hope all you supportive moms are <br/>\nsomewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and need <br/>\nsome real good advice soon.<br/>\nokay here is the situation.<br/>\nMy dd is 81/2.<br/>\nOver the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a cleaning <br/>\nspree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for her <br/>\nlast weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of &quot;spotting&quot; <br/>\non them . <br/>\nOkay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11 myself <br/>\nmy sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe my <br/>\nhusbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>\nAnyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was talking <br/>\nabout. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little <br/>\nembarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my <br/>\nbestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her 10 yod <br/>\njust had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me to <br/>\nbring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left them <br/>\nout for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I <br/>\ntried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have any <br/>\nquestions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for now <br/>\n.What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp this <br/>\nconcept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want to <br/>\nmake sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to the <br/>\nDrs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone agree? The <br/>\nbooklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For an 8 <br/>\nyo? I think not. <br/>\nAnybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHELP!!<br/>\nNot ready Mom<br/>\nTamie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8007,"nextTopicId":8050}}
