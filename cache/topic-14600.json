A good place to start is always second hand stores.  I live in a city where winter lasts 6 months of the year, so even the Salvation Army carries snow shoes, skies, etc.  Sports equipment refurbishers are also really good places to get equipment, but they can still be kind of pricey, so make sure you really like the activity first.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatagonia has a bargain section to it&#39;s web-site.  REI&#39;s bargain site is really good.  Up here in Canada there is a chain called Mountain Equipment Co-op, they sell similar stuff to Patagonia, but much cheaper, and not as good quality.  Patagonia is made for mountain climbers and such, so most people don&#39;t need that sort of quality.
