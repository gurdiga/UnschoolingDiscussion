(do you have to sign up with a charter school? do you have to test her annually?.. .that sort of thing).<br/>\nThere are plenty of places to gather that type of information and I&#39;m sure some can provide links for you. If you are thinking along the lines of changing your whole outlook on learning and the goals your teen has, this would be the place to hang out and ask questions.<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Faith Mills <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2002 11:41 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro and question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello....someone told me about this list.
