It&#39;s<br/>\nfascinating to find<br/>\nout what will excite him and he wants to find out more about.  Lately he<br/>\nis playing &quot;The<br/>\nIncredible Toon Machine&quot; on the computer.  He plays it a few times a<br/>\nday, probably<br/>\ntotally an hour.   I don&#39;t have a major problem with this, I just want<br/>\nhim (and me) to have<br/>\nvariety in our day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a Christian home schooler, but I&#39;m not against finding our<br/>\nabout Christian values.<br/>\nWhen I first moved here, a Baptist homeschooling Mom loaned me a<br/>\nCharlotte Mason book.<br/>\nOne of the things I gathered out of it is Jesus doesn&#39;t want us to put<br/>\nobstacles in front of our<br/>\nChildren&#39;s learning.  Sounds kind of Unschooling to me.  Charlotte Mason<br/>\nfeels children,<br/>\nparticularly younger children should have the afternoon off to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherry from Upper Michigan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13849,"nextTopicId":13854}}
