Right before I became really angry, it dawned  <br/>\non me that she was, indeed, a high school dropout because she chose to start <br/>\nher  family at age 16.  When she dropped the comment, that the local school was <br/>\n really one of the best, I laughed wholeheartedly, and said, &quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nso  good for you, now was it?&quot;  I have never heard another word from her or <br/>\nthe  rest of the family about why my kids don&#39;t seem to be doing anything all <br/>\nday, or  how awful we are about not sending them to school.  One can just hold <br/>\na  conversation with my children, and find out more about the world, than the  <br/>\nschool even has time to teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":104270,"nextTopicId":104295}}
