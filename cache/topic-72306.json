They assume the negative behavior they see when they let go of control<br/>\nis part of children&#39;s nature not a result of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child who has TV, video games, food controlled will often glut on them<br/>\nwithout control. It&#39;s natural to assume that behavior would continue unless<br/>\nparents returned the controls. Most parents believe that to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich would mean that children who are not controlled would be eating<br/>\nnothing but sweets and do nothing but watch TV or play video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t happen. if parents trust that children will choose what they<br/>\nneed, after a transition period, when children trust that something is truly<br/>\nunlimited that they can access at any time, then they let go of the need to<br/>\nhoard it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we need to discuss honestly what does and doesn&#39;t happen with kids<br/>\nbecause there is no body of &quot;common knowledge&quot; of what will happen with kids<br/>\nwho are raised in freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t unexplored territory. There are people here who are living it<br/>\nwith happy, joyful children. There are grown unschoolers out in the world.<br/>\nThere are kids who are about to enter the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You know, I don&#39;t have to &quot;sit in&quot; for awhile to discover what this group<br/>\n&gt; is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably true of any group that we can learn a lot more by assuming --<br/>\nnot accepting but assuming -- that the people in the group are being honest<br/>\nand thoughtful. If they say something that strikes us wrong, we&#39;ll get<br/>\nbetter information by asking questions to try to understand why they believe<br/>\nsomething to be true than if we tell them we&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we enter a group curious but determined to hold onto what we believe it&#39;s<br/>\nlikely we&#39;ll learn little. That protective wall we enter with to defend<br/>\nourselves and our ideas does a good job of screening out ideas that are<br/>\nconfusing or frightening or seemingly stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we check our defensive walls at the door and enter as empty vessels<br/>\nwe&#39;re likely to learn a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean we need to automatically believe what we hear but we can<br/>\ntry to understand how others believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing and trying to understand new ideas isn&#39;t like getting a tatoo. It<br/>\nisn&#39;t permanent. If we spend a while trying to understand people and ideas<br/>\nand the ideas don&#39;t feel right we can drop them like new clothes and put our<br/>\nold ones back on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From<br/>\n&gt; what I&#39;ve seen here, it sounds like you&#39;re raising your children in some<br/>\n&gt; collective bubble, and if this is the direction unschooling is taking,<br/>\n&gt; then the &quot;experiment&quot; is doomed to fail.

They will naturally encounter rude<br/>\npeople. Their friends will not always behave nicely. Our children will not<br/>\nalways behave nicely. They *know* that life isn&#39;t like home. That&#39;s pretty<br/>\nmuch a &quot;duh!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to make children remain in situations that are unpleasant to<br/>\nexpose them to negative elements. What people in general need is to feel<br/>\n*empowered* They need to know they have a choice about the negative<br/>\nelements. They don&#39;t have to put up with them. They can change something, or<br/>\nwalk away from it and find a better path, or decide the end result will be<br/>\nworth the negative elements, or ...? But their only choice isn&#39;t to put up<br/>\nwith something.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy removing them or stepping in or talking about something or helping them<br/>\ndeal with a situation -- but this is too vague and real examples are *much*<br/>\nmore fruitful for discussing what we&#39;re talking about -- we&#39;re modeling for<br/>\nthem what they can do when faced with something they don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How is a child to learn to<br/>\n&gt; tolerate frustration if mommy and daddy never allow frustration in<br/>\n&gt; his/her life?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How can a child live life without frustration? Being a child *is*<br/>\nfrustration. Things are up too high. They can&#39;t go places without an adult.<br/>\nDays are too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to frustrate them more than life naturally will.

It will take a lot fewer words if you drop the assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make sense that we&#39;d be giving kids &quot;free rein&quot; as you&#39;re imagining<br/>\nit? That we&#39;re all sitting back and letting our kids make decisions in<br/>\nvacuum?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ask. You&#39;ll learn more by asking questions.

Being conscious of<br/>\nothers needs isn&#39;t immediate and takes more years for some kids than others.<br/>\nBut if we understand that they aren&#39;t doing something because they&#39;re mean<br/>\nand it&#39;s just because they can&#39;t understand yet we can help them deal with<br/>\nit and work towards understanding without controling them and setting up<br/>\nrules.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost adults would be livid if they were treated as children are treated by<br/>\nparents. How would it make a wife feel if her husband told her she had to<br/>\nstart dinner at 5 or go to bed at 10? We accept that children need to be<br/>\ntreated differently than adults because &quot;they just have to learn&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an assumptions that should be questioned in the light of parents here<br/>\nwho are helping their kids be aware of when their bodies are telling them to<br/>\nrest rather than telling thier kids the clock knows them better than they<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children are treated with disrespect then they will do as was modeled for<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They don&#39;t need to be wholly left to their own devices -- that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; why they are children and we are adults!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a tricky point. There just aren&#39;t the proper words to describe to<br/>\nsomeone who is used to control what freedom means. People often read what&#39;s<br/>\nwritten here and hear &quot;left to their own devices.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAware parenting isn&#39;t hands off. It&#39;s very hands on. Probably more hands on<br/>\nthan rules are because we&#39;re helping our children make their own decisions<br/>\nrather than setting some rule in place and having them follow it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I hadn&#39;t insisted when my kids were younger on their<br/>\n&gt; participating in certain events, taking up certain activities, etc., they<br/>\n&gt; never would have discovered their true interest in those activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, you don&#39;t know that. It&#39;s an assumption stated as fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general society we hear and see the positive outcomes of children being<br/>\nmade to do something so it seems like a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we can&#39;t see the interests that were killed because a child was made to<br/>\ndo something against their will.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t know what they would have discovered had they been allowed to make<br/>\ntheir own choices. (Choices in a rich life where they had a variety of<br/>\nopportunites to choose from, where the parents were also involved in doing<br/>\ninteresting things.) If you read long enough you&#39;ll see how parents can<br/>\nencourage and make available without making kids do anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100122184,"authorName":"Lisa M.

I don&#39;t mean to talk for everyone else,<br/>\nbut I keep reading that not a one of them thinks that a child is an adult,<br/>\nbut every one of them thinks that children are people.

It is very important to me to never be brainwashed<br/>\non any topic.  Do you think that it is possible to be brainwashed that<br/>\nchildren need to be taught things in order to learn them?

They&#39;ve never been coerced to eat<br/>\nanything and they are the ones that have the healthiest diets in my family.<br/>\nDH and I grew up with lots of food restrictions and we find comfort in the<br/>\nfoods that we snuck as children.  I&#39;m slowly &quot;Undieting&quot;, but I can see that<br/>\nit is going to take a long time to undo all the years of food teaching that<br/>\nwas done to me.  Thankfully, my children will never have to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, we had a picnic with another wonderful homeschooling family (I&#39;m<br/>\nfinally starting to find some).  My 2.5 yo daughter was given the option to<br/>\neat whatever she wanted.  She chose 3-4 potato chips for an appetizer,<br/>\ngrapes for her main course, and a couple of apple slices for dessert, with<br/>\nonly water to quench her thirst.  Her choice and she stopped eating the<br/>\nsecond that she was full and she refused to eat anymore.  It brought back<br/>\nmemories of not being allowed to have the chips until the &quot;healthy&quot; sandwich<br/>\nwas eaten, eating the sandwich and being full, but still downing as many<br/>\nchips as I possibly could just so that I could finally have them (then I&#39;d<br/>\neat the dessert, too, and I usually didn&#39;t even like it).  I&#39;ll never force<br/>\nmy children to eat or not eat certain foods.

Don&#39;t you<br/>\nunderstand that when people make statements such as, &quot;My child would...if<br/>\nI let him...&quot;  it&#39;s not meant to be taken so literally?  It&#39;s only meant<br/>\nto suggest that, as in my case, the child likes something above and<br/>\nbeyond what would seem usual.  Come on, do you really think, as in your<br/>\nexample, the child would literally never, ever, ever turn off the<br/>\nNintendo game--?  Eureka!  We&#39;ve discovered true perpetual motion in our<br/>\nson&#39;s room!!  Lighten up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I don&#39;t have to &quot;sit in&quot; for awhile to discover what this group<br/>\nis all about.  As one of my favorite professors used to say, &quot;I only have<br/>\nto smell perfume to know a woman&#39;s been in the room.&quot;  I haven&#39;t made up<br/>\nmy mind yet about &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I&#39;ll tell you, my brief experience<br/>\nwith this group has taught me volumes.  You folks talk about preventing<br/>\nyour children from being exposed to rude people -- well, maybe you need<br/>\nto reconsider your definition of rude.  You need to walk the walk.  From<br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve seen here, it sounds like you&#39;re raising your children in some<br/>\ncollective bubble, and if this is the direction unschooling is taking,<br/>\nthen the &quot;experiment&quot; is doomed to fail. Exposure to negative elements in<br/>\nlife can provide some immunity for children down the road, when they&#39;re<br/>\non their own -- much the same way that exposure to certain viruses, etc.,<br/>\nprovides defenses against further attack.  How is a child to learn to<br/>\ntolerate frustration if mommy and daddy never allow frustration in<br/>\nhis/her life?  The ability to handle frustration is one of the gifts we<br/>\npossess as humans, but it&#39;s a skill that needs to be honed, as with any<br/>\nother skill.  Delaying gratification is another very necessary &quot;skill&quot; we<br/>\nneed to teach.  Allowing children -- who are not just little adults --<br/>\nfree rein over absolutely everything that affects their lives is doing<br/>\nthem a great disservice.  It&#39;s hedonism gone berserk!!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you&#39;re giving your children &quot;freedom&quot; to choose their own paths,<br/>\nbut are you really?  Isn&#39;t this whole &quot;unschooling&quot; concept just another<br/>\nform of brainwashing, of manipulation?.  Whatever happened to children<br/>\nneeding boundaries?  How can anyone, in good conscience, allow children<br/>\nto choose their own boundaries to the extent that you all seem to be<br/>\ndoing?  You all just seem to be feeding off of each other with no clear<br/>\ndirection.  It&#39;s some type of dysfunction disguised as good parenting. <br/>\nBullshit!!  There are some things you just shouldn&#39;t mess with, one of<br/>\nthem being human nature.  Children seek and need limitations in their<br/>\nlives.  They don&#39;t need to be wholly left to their own devices -- that&#39;s<br/>\nwhy they are children and we are adults!  And this whole thing about<br/>\nletting the child choose what he/she is interested in. Okay, that&#39;s good<br/>\n-- to a point.  If I hadn&#39;t insisted when my kids were younger on their<br/>\nparticipating in certain events, taking up certain activities, etc., they<br/>\nnever would have discovered their true interest in those activities. <br/>\nThis extreme position I&#39;m seeing here, which you define as &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>\nis looking more and more like laziness to me.

I never said too much snacks is too <br/>\nmuch. Just has never been an issue. This am, the baby dug out a tomatoes and the 3 <br/>\nyr. old grabbed a cucumber and cut it up and shared with the 11 yr. old and 1 <br/>\nyr. old.  She also likes to dump uncooked Mac N cheese in a bowl and play <br/>\nwith it and eat some. Today she added shredded cheese. The 11 yr. old cooked a <br/>\nbox of Mac N. Cheese. <br/>\n<br/>\nI often see them eating lunch things for breakfast cuz they get up now <br/>\nbetween 9-10. Not an issue here. If they get hungry later they may have a bowl of <br/>\ncereal. <br/>\nI usually will cook the 1yr old a meal he may or may not eat it but knows he <br/>\ncan go over to the fridge and grap what he wants like <br/>\ncheese,apples,orange,banana, Yogurt, pudding, tomatoes, cucumbers or cantaloupe whatever happens to be <br/>\nin there that day. If he sees a snack on the counter he points to it, we get <br/>\nit.<br/>\nIf we are in a store and they ask for a candy bar or something I buy it.  <br/>\nThey may ask once a week or once a month.  I have never made a stink about junk <br/>\nfood so its something they may or may not want-not a must have because they are <br/>\nchecking to see if I will say no.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":117212306,"authorName":"Christina M Ledford","from":"Christina M Ledford &lt;christina989@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] experience and diet (was Praising Our Kids)","postDate":"1054828106","msgId":72321,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwNjA1LjExNDgyNy43NzE2LjMuY2hyaXN0aW5hOTg5QGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":72317,"nextInTopic":72331,"prevInTime":72320,"nextInTime":72322,"topicId":72306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, 5 Jun 2003 10:46:53 EDT SandraDodd@aol.com writes: . ... they want, etc.  I was raised in one -- long, long before homeschooling in its current form","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-797263058\">On Thu, 5 Jun 2003 10:46:53 EDT <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Christina, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve not known families in which children <br/>\n&gt; can eat <br/>\n&gt; what and when they want, where the children have never once been <br/>\n&gt; made to &quot;clean <br/>\n&gt; their plates.&quot;  It&#39;s rare, and the traditional methods of feeding <br/>\n&gt; children <br/>\n&gt; make it seem crazy, but it&#39;s not. &gt; &gt; resulted in them <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ahh!

And on the subject of kids deciding on <br/>\ntheir own what to eat, rather than having someone else &quot;dole it out&quot; to them  <br/>\nI have nearly seventeen years successful experience at that, with three <br/>\nchildren now, added to three children of whom I had custody earlier in life (and did <br/>\nNOT know what I know now about freedom of choice), and my own history, and <br/>\nthe histories of the hundreds of people who are likewise involved in alternative <br/>\nfamily lives and successfully finding that giving freedom creates good <br/>\njudgment, while withholding freedom creates problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina, it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve not known families in which children can eat <br/>\nwhat and when they want, where the children have never once been made to &quot;clean <br/>\ntheir plates.&quot;  It&#39;s rare, and the traditional methods of feeding children <br/>\nmake it seem crazy, but it&#39;s not.

He turned down chips, pie and other fruit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got home yesterday he had a milk shake, which I offered to make him <br/>\nand he happily accepted.  We have candy and soda, but he didn&#39;t want any.  He <br/>\nhas three pieces of chocolate he got Tuesday (looks like little rolls of film, <br/>\nimported chocolate in foil).
