That&#39;s telling them honestly what <br/>\nyour needs are.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re tired, no one is suggesting ignoring your body to do only what <br/>\nother people want!<br/>\nBut arbitrary limits and bodily needs are two different things.<br/>\nI tell my children when I&#39;m going to bed and if they want me to lay down and <br/>\ntuck them in, that&#39;s the time they need to come, or I&#39;ll fall asleep and <br/>\nthey&#39;re on their own.<br/>\nAnd I ask Trevor to shut down the tv long enough for me to get the baby and <br/>\nSierra through the bedtime ritual if they&#39;re getting tired (or me). They need <br/>\na quiet calm house to help them settle in.<br/>\nAfter they are tucked in then Trevor and Jared can do as they wish (although <br/>\nJared usually comes when I tuck babsy boy in, as he likes to cuddle too).<br/>\nLast night I was a Grinch and sent everyone to their rooms so the main part <br/>\nof the house would be quiet.<br/>\nWe had a hectic morning coming up, and I needed to have some prep <br/>\ntime.....none of them were told to go to sleep, just be in their rooms quiet. <br/>\nI went to cuddle with them and they were all asleep!!
