I grew up there & lived just north of there in Mooresville for<br/>\n10 yrs before moving to VA.  We are trying to get back, my husband is<br/>\njob-hunting now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I have not actually homeschooled in NC I know that the laws are<br/>\neasy.  You must keep attendance records and test each year, but you keep<br/>\nthose in a file rather than turn them in.  Also, you only need a high school<br/>\ndiploma and you only file once.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also sent out &quot;feelers&quot; for unschoolers since we hope to be moving<br/>\nSOON.  There is a group in Gastonia which is about 20 minutes from<br/>\nCharlotte.  There is a group in Winston Salem & one in Greensboro.  There<br/>\nmay be more, maybe in the Raleigh area.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlotte is a great place, still has a small town feeling although it&#39;s<br/>\ngrowing daily!  There is so much we miss now that we are in a very rural<br/>\narea.  Luckily my family still live there so we get back often.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know if you need more info....you can write off-list if you like & I<br/>\nwill help all I can.  Good luck with your move.<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15506,"nextTopicId":13021}}
