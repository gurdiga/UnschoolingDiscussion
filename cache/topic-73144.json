LOL    It&#39;s definitely a keeper.   <br/>\n <br/>\nMr. Bean was one of my kids first favorite video&#39;s from about the age of 4.   Imo it&#39;s absolutely the best humorous video for young kids out there!  :)   We haven&#39;t watched that video in ages, I think I&#39;m going to have to dig it out today and not wait until near Christmas (in the video we have he gets the x-mas turkey stuck on his head &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n <br/>\nI still think Kyle is do-able though!!  &lt;g&gt;   In &quot;homefront&quot; he looked nothing like Mr. Bean!   LOL    Part of the attraction for me I admit was/is? his voice.     <br/>\n <br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Mary [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mummy124@...\">mummy124@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Sunday, June 08, 2003 11:25 PM<br/>\nTo: Unschooling list.com<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Mr. Bean<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell that didn&#39;t look like Mr. Bean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is Mr. Bean and he&#39;s definitely not doable!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary B (who&#39;s husband told me to do this)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sodamnfunny.com/Picture/picture.html?/Picture/Bean/bean.jpg\">http://www.sodamnfunny.com/Picture/picture.html?/Picture/Bean/bean.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
