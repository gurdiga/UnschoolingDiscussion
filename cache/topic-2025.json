My son is 6 and has been<br/>\ntrying to read since about 4.  He has been read to a lot as he has a sister<br/>\n5 years older.  While he was an infant, and toddler he was always listening<br/>\nin to her stories and as she was older, many books were chapter books.  I<br/>\nsay he has been trying to read because he has never been taught, rather<br/>\ntrying on his own accord.  At around 4 he would occasionally ask what some<br/>\nword was on the page...usually a big word like &quot;CRASH&quot;  or<br/>\n&quot;BOOM&quot;...something that was written in bold colors and that I would have<br/>\nread loud!  Or he noticed the McDonald&#39;s &quot;M&quot; and wanted to know if that said<br/>\n&quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and we would tell him that is the first letter of McDonald&#39;s,<br/>\netc., etc.<br/>\nAlso around this age he started playing Playstation.  He knew long before<br/>\nthis how to put a VCR tape or a computer game in and putting in a CD into<br/>\nPlaystation was no problem.  BUT, he could not alway tell which game he<br/>\nwanted to play if they were all mixed up and out of their cases.  He would<br/>\nget frustrated asking someone to come and help him find such and such.  So I<br/>\nwould hear him putting letters to certain games and then I think he started<br/>\nrecognizing the titles and doing phoenetic sounding out.  (He knew his<br/>\nalphabet, letter recognition and most letter sounds from playing computer<br/>\ngames, singing ABC with his sister and watching various TV shows.)  After he<br/>\nmastered telling games apart and really playing them, he wanted to know<br/>\ndetails of the game.  Like how to get the green sword to work and how much<br/>\nbonus points was the little guy worth and what did the pop up screen say<br/>\nabout saving his score, etc.  So he would have me read these little game<br/>\nbooklets to him over and over and he started to pick up words.  Now over the<br/>\ncourse of 2 years, he can pretty much read anything.  He is still figuring<br/>\nout that &quot;e&quot; on the end doesn&#39;t make a sound and makes one of the letters<br/>\nchange sounds.  He doesn&#39;t know &quot;vowels&quot; or &quot;rules&quot; but he can figure out<br/>\nhis Playstation booklets!!

Then again, using that same context, one <br/>\ncan also say that it is natural for young girls in Eastern Turkey to <br/>\nmarry when they are teenagers, because that is the norm there as <br/>\nwell. But is the act of marrying young, and in fact the institution <br/>\nof marriage itself, a &quot;natural process&quot; in the scientific way that <br/>\nother people are taking the term to mean? No, it&#39;s a cultural <br/>\ninvention, just like writing is. Speaking is biologically natural for <br/>\nhumans, and coupling is biologically natural for humans; reading and <br/>\nmarriage are culturally-specific concepts which may or may not be <br/>\nnatural to a particular human, dependent on what kind of culture the <br/>\nhuman is in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll humans all over the world learn to walk and talk at roughly the <br/>\nsame time. Even babies who are woefully neglected in orphanages <br/>\nmanage to figure out how to at move on their own and at least make <br/>\nbabbling noises even if they&#39;re not spoken to. Those are &quot;natural <br/>\nprocesses&quot; in the scientific context--they are universally <br/>\ninstinctual human behaviors. One cannot say the same thing about <br/>\nreading; there is no instinct to specifically read per se, only an <br/>\ninstinct to learn.

He comes from a &quot;schooling&quot; perspective, but mentions many<br/>\npoints that I believe support an unschooling viewpoint.  One of his<br/>\npoints is that many people don&#39;t enjoy reading because of 12 years of<br/>\nbeing told what to read and then having to write reports on it!  I heard<br/>\nhim speak last spring and my write-up of that follows.  Feel free to skip<br/>\nit and go straight to his website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.trelease-on-reading.com\">http://www.trelease-on-reading.com</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nJim Trelease, author of The Read Aloud Handbook, entertained and<br/>\nmotivated a small audience of parents and educators in Kennewick on the<br/>\nsubject of reading aloud to children.  His presentation focused on the<br/>\nidea that reading skills are critical to success in school and beyond and<br/>\nsuggested ways to make reading aloud part of your family&#39;s lifestyle. <br/>\nTrelease was honored by the International Reading Association as one of<br/>\neight people who made the largest contributions to reading in the 1980&#39;s.<br/>\nBesides his New Read-Aloud Handbook, Trelease is also the author of Hey!<br/>\nListen to This: Stories to Read Aloud, and Read All About It!: Great<br/>\nRead-Aloud Stories, Poems, and Newspaper Pieces for Preteens and Teens.<br/>\nAs with most activities, children improve their reading skills by �<br/>\nreading!  At first, children learn to read.  Then they read to learn. <br/>\nTrelease says that self-education begins with the knowledge that you can<br/>\nread whatever you want for your own purposes. Yet many children associate<br/>\nreading with work, rather than pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading aloud to your child gives your child background knowledge of the<br/>\nworld, provides the child with a &quot;reading role model&quot;, and conditions the<br/>\nchild to associate reading with pleasure.  In Becoming A Nation of<br/>\nReaders, the Commission on Reading reports, &quot;The single most important<br/>\nactivity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in<br/>\nreading is reading aloud to children.&quot; Trelease stressed that reading<br/>\naloud should continue even after children learn to read for themselves. <br/>\nA child&#39;s ability to listen exceeds his ability to read, often by several<br/>\ngrade levels.  In print, language is more complicated and sophisticated<br/>\nthan in speech.  So by reading aloud to a child, you increase the<br/>\nexposure to words and styles of grammar not usually encountered in daily<br/>\nconversations.  While The Reading Foundation is encouraging parents to<br/>\nread to their children 20 minutes a day, Trelease goes further, calling<br/>\nfor at least 30 to 45 minutes every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t insist that you throw out your TV, but Trelease did suggest<br/>\nthat controlling your child&#39;s viewing habits would make a difference. <br/>\nTrelease presented graphs showing the correlation between the number of<br/>\nhours eighth graders watched TV and their scores on reading tests.  As<br/>\nyou might expect, more TV viewing was linked with lower test scores. <br/>\nThere was a similar relation between TV viewing and math scores.  One<br/>\ncurious anomaly was found in Finland.  These eighth graders watched many<br/>\nhours of television and had high reading scores.  Upon closer<br/>\nexamination, it was found that 50% of television shows in Finland are<br/>\nimported and these foreign shows are broadcast with Finnish subtitles. In<br/>\neffect, these children were actually reading their TV!  Trelease pointed<br/>\nout that you could mimic this by setting your TV to &quot;close captioned&quot; and<br/>\nturning off the volume.<br/>\nForget the worksheets and expensive phonics programs, Trelease said. <br/>\nThese do not motivate kids to read.  He suggested that you spend your<br/>\nmoney instead on the &quot;3 B&#39;s&quot;, to complement the &quot;3 R&#39;s&quot; of schooling:  <br/>\n�(1) Books as gifts.  Bookstores, yard sales, and the Internet are all<br/>\nsources of books to enjoy.  Trelease made a joke of comparing a new $12<br/>\ncopy of Charlotte&#39;s Web with one found at a yard sale for 25 cents. <br/>\n&quot;They have the same words!&quot; he said.<br/>\n�(2) Book Baskets. Trelease recommended that parents put baskets of books<br/>\nanywhere in the house where children may be a captive audience, such as<br/>\nthe bathroom or the dining table.  He said we shouldn&#39;t worry about<br/>\n&quot;messing up&quot; a book when the important thing is to encourage reading.<br/>\n�(3) Bed lamps.  According to leading opthomologists, Trelease said, it<br/>\nis physically impossible to ruin your eyes by reading in bed!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe inspiring presentation wound up with suggestions of many wonderful<br/>\nbooks to read aloud.  In the Read Aloud Handbook, Trelease lists 1400<br/>\ntitles ranging from wordless picture books to chapter books.  He pointed<br/>\nout that many of our popular stories come from more than one country. <br/>\nReading several versions of a story can enlarge your child&#39;s view of the<br/>\nworld.
