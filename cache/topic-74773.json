Often, a baby will go on a nursing strike for one <br/>\nreason or another. This can be caused by something traumatic <br/>\noccurring, even something as simple as a mom yelling loudly when a <br/>\nbaby bites, a mom wearing different clothes, or smelling different. <br/>\nIt can also be caused by the baby teething or by many other things. <br/>\nNursing strikes can last hours, or days, or even a week or more, but <br/>\nI know many moms who have successfully gotten the baby back to the <br/>\nbreast after a nursing strike. The thing is, if a baby goes to <br/>\nbottles from the breast, child-led weaning hasn&#39;t occurred. A change <br/>\nin preference or ease of eating has occurred. A child who is old <br/>\nenough to wean will have already given up liquid nourishment like <br/>\nformula not just switching the method of conveyance (breast to <br/>\nbottle). <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, lots of moms confuse the 8 - 12 month distractibility <br/>\nphase with weaning. I&#39;ve nursed two babes through that time period <br/>\nand yes, they are much more distractible during that timeframe and <br/>\nsometimes even hard to get *to* the breast. It&#39;s an easy time to <br/>\n*wean them* either on purpose or inadvertantly, but it&#39;s not a <br/>\nnatural age for weaning either. At that point, they have been weaned, <br/>\neither on purpose or by the mother confusing distractibility with <br/>\nweaning, but they aren&#39;t weaning themselves. A child without formula <br/>\navailable (as in indigenous peoples) could not be weaned at this age <br/>\nand easily survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130291286,"authorName":"raineluvsj@yahoo.com","from":"&quot;raineluvsj@...&quot; &lt;rainelovesj@...&gt;","profile":"raineluvsj","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: thumb sucking? / nursing","postDate":"1056050847","msgId":74872,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxM2EwMWMzMzY5OCRkMjQwZDkyMCQwMmZlYThjMEBocHBhdj4=","referencesHeader":"PGJjdDI5NSt0Y2ozQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74869,"nextInTopic":74876,"prevInTime":74871,"nextInTime":74873,"topicId":74773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Patti wrote: I can t personally imagine a six month old really weaning unless you re talking about a baby who is also bottlefed and begins to prefer the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2109578062\">Patti wrote: I can&#39;t personally imagine a six month old really weaning unless <br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about a baby who is also bottlefed and begins to <br/>\nprefer the bottle. <br/>\n<br/>\nRaine replies: My daughter weaned herself at 8 mos. because I cut my hair.

I <br/>\nfelt bad enough about bringing Marty in without cutting Kirby off, so I tried <br/>\nall manner of tricks and tools, and talked to moms who were doing it fine, to <br/>\ntry to see if I could change my response, but it was physical.   As soon as <br/>\nMarty latched on, my body went all soft and the right hormones came, and it was <br/>\njust perfect.  Kirby, one second later, I was having violent visions of <br/>\ngetting him OFF me.  Freaky and very sad for me.  I know one other mom who had that <br/>\nhappen.  She was sad too, and tried a few months anyway too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI went six whole months, but near the end of it told him I was really sorry <br/>\nbut it wasn&#39;t feeling so good, what else could we do?  We made a deal about a <br/>\nNinja Turtle costume, and I rocked him to sleep every night for WEEKS (maybe <br/>\nmonths) singing &quot;Kirby&#39;s Magic Horse Song,&quot;  It was The Ash Grove (the tune), <br/>\nwhich has really long, slow lines and gave me a chance to think of a next line.  <br/>\nThey were all ad libbed, but the same theme.  They involved Kirby getting a <br/>\nmagic flying horse for his birthday, and going on adventures to help other <br/>\npeople.  And every time, the people they helped happened somehow to have Ninja <br/>\nTurtle toys and let Kirby have one or two of them out of gratitude for his <br/>\ngenerous help.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a truck was broken down, and Kirby and his horse helped the driver, and <br/>\nthe truck was full of Ninja Turtle toys.  Once they helped someone who worked <br/>\nat WalMart who gave him... a Ninja Turtle toy.

They were playing all by themselves and they weren’t <br/>\nscared.  They were outside at a house that wasn’t our house and it was far away. <br/>\nThen Kirby was playing  all by himself and he wasn’t scared but Marty was <br/>\nplaying all by himself and he was crying so Kirby went to find me and we were <br/>\nlooking for Marty but we couldn’t find him.

They <br/>\nrecovered more easily from sickness, and neither of them gets sick <br/>\nvery often. When we&#39;ve gone through serious health problems (my son&#39;s <br/>\nserious allergies at age 4, when there were very few foods he could <br/>\neat), the breastfeeding suddenly became hugely important. He was <br/>\ngetting excellent nutrition through breastmilk when he had a very <br/>\nlimited diet, and I was able to comfort him when he was feeling very <br/>\nsick, covered with hives, etc. Of course, that meant for a long time <br/>\nthat I had to also avoid every food he was allergic too. Ever had a <br/>\nrice noodle and rice cheese casserole? Blech! I couldn&#39;t have <br/>\nforeseen these upcoming issues when he was 3 and his sister was born, <br/>\nso I&#39;m very glad that I continued the nursing relationship with him <br/>\nso that it was available at that time. There were many more emotional <br/>\nbenefits too. Non-existant sibling rivalry when my 2nd was born, and <br/>\na very close tie between the two. My son never felt that he was <br/>\ndisplaced or denied something that was so important to him because of <br/>\nhis little sister. Now that he&#39;s old enough to tell me how important <br/>\nnursing was to him, I can see how that could&#39;ve been very hard for <br/>\nhim to deal with if I&#39;d weaned him when she was small.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd FWIW, I haven&#39;t found LLL leaders to be the best source of info <br/>\nand support for nursing older kids. All the leaders I personally know <br/>\nweaned at 3 or 4. I have yet to meet one who let their child wean <br/>\nnaturally. Some of the ones I know did some pretty egregious things, <br/>\nIMHO, like promising a 3 year old a weaning party with presents if <br/>\nthey weaned. Then the day after the party they have a sobbing 3 year <br/>\nold who just didn&#39;t understand he was really going to have to give up <br/>\nthe single most important thing in his life. To me, that feels <br/>\nmanipulative, underhanded, and icky and very non-respecting of the <br/>\nchild. If, for some reason, I ever did have to initiate weaning, I&#39;d <br/>\nhope to do it with honesty and forthrightness and honor the child&#39;s <br/>\ngrieving over the loss. So, at least in my experience, if you&#39;re <br/>\nlooking for support for nursing a child over age 3 or 4, look <br/>\nelsewhere than LLL.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\ntandeming for almost 4 years now...</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"Joylyn","from":"Joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: thumb sucking? / nursing","postDate":"1056001379","msgId":74835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFRjE0RDYzLjEwNTA2MDRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGJjcHA4YSt2OGdpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8M0VGMEM0QjEuQjcyOTAxOUFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":74797,"nextInTopic":74853,"prevInTime":74834,"nextInTime":74836,"topicId":74773,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I loved tandem nursing.

I found it wonderful.  I did not like nursing <br/>\nthe two at the same time, but I did like nursing my younger one and then <br/>\nnursing my older one.  I had fewer problems with engorgement.  There are <br/>\nso many reasons to continue to nurse past 2 years, I can&#39;t even name <br/>\nthem all.  I think for me, the major surgery Lexie had at age 3, where <br/>\nshe recovered in half the time, and even the doc said it was likely <br/>\nbecause she was still nursing and had breastmilk after surgery. <br/>\n Toddlers and preschoolers who nurse to sleep go to sleep easily.  It <br/>\nreconnected me to my children after a long day.  When Janene weaned at <br/>\nfour, I felt it was early weaning, and was sad.  When Lexie had surgery <br/>\nlast year, we all realized it was her first surgery without breastmilk <br/>\nand I actually got some breastmilk from the milk bank to use, but she <br/>\ndidnt&#39; like the taste (it&#39;s pasterized, and it wasn&#39;t mommy&#39;s milk). <br/>\n There is a lot of stuff out on the web about long term nursing...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ** he&#39;s two, but it&#39;s been four years straight, tandem nursing a newborn<br/>\n&gt; and a two year old for a whole year..**<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi, Ang --<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I only have one child, but all of my friends who tandem nursed confide<br/>\n&gt; that they found it VERY irritating.
