If it helps any<br/>\nto know, this is my second marriage and in many ways my second family.<br/>\nI have an adult son who was traditionally schooled.  I did a lot of<br/>\nwork on myself while I was single to get where I am today.  I also<br/>\nfound a supportive spouse this time around - he&#39;s is as an unschooler<br/>\nas I am!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope we can support you in whatever ways you need.  Being a single<br/>\nmother is difficult.  If something ever happened where my children<br/>\nneeded to go to a brick-and-mortar school, I&#39;d use a Sudbury Valley<br/>\none too.  And if it helps, I have seen a lot of support for those<br/>\nparents who want to unschool and who can&#39;t fully because of a spouse&#39;s<br/>\nobjection.  Leaving isn&#39;t always an option and it isn&#39;t always in the<br/>\nbest interest of the child either.  Sometimes it is hard to share <br/>\npersonal information on lists like this but it does help to understand<br/>\nthe specifics for each family.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy Ferguson<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:crma@...\">crma@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85994576,"authorName":"Kolleen","from":"Kolleen &lt;Kolleen@...&gt;","profile":"kaydeecross","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] the haves, the havenots and  unschooling by definition","postDate":"1012244037","msgId":31748,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTI4MTg1My5nMFNJclFmWjAwODA5OEBueWNzbXRwMW91dC5yZGMtbnljLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31751,"prevInTime":31747,"nextInTime":31749,"topicId":31748,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So in <br/>\norder to avoid intergenerational dysfunctions, somebody in the line has <br/>\nto stop and change that path.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person was raised with self-worth, they will most likely make <br/>\nchoices that will allow unschooling to fall easier in their path. Such as <br/>\na supportive spouse. Which then snowballs into falling within the normal <br/>\nrealm of daily issues that arise. And the decision to unschool won&#39;t be <br/>\nAS MUCH as an uphill battle as say the scenario below.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, lets say you have someone who had a dysfunctionally controlling <br/>\nparent. This person then marries a controlling spouse. At some point, <br/>\nthey &#39;wake&#39; up and realize that this isn&#39;t what life and parenting are <br/>\nall about, and decide they want to take steps to make changes. So they <br/>\npull the kids out of school and start unschooling. The spouse is now <br/>\ngoing nuts because dinner isn&#39;t on the table by X o&#39;clock, the house is <br/>\nmessier now that the kids are home, and the spouse is unyielding and <br/>\nrelentless in being a thorn in the side of the parent trying to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis parent now has a bigger hurdle to jump, and the steps towards <br/>\nunschooling may be slow even though the wishes of the parent is to make <br/>\ngiant ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you might say, well that person should leave. This time I can speak <br/>\nfrom personal experience. I left my unhusband because I did not want to <br/>\nlive in NYC and he would not move. Being a single mother isn&#39;t easy, and <br/>\nit makes it much harder to unschool. I chose to live near a Sudbury <br/>\nValley school (my personal choice over unschooling). But it wasn&#39;t an <br/>\neasy ride AND I only have one child. I can&#39;t tell another person to do <br/>\nwhat I did. It wasn&#39;t easy and it takes a certain personality to do so. I <br/>\nalso ended up homeless and broke for a short period of time. Again, not a <br/>\nchoice I would tell someone to make. I can&#39;t imagine what a parent of 2+ <br/>\nkids would do. Most of them choose to stay. <br/>\n<br/>\nI give the people credit that want to change the intergenerational <br/>\ntendencies and move forward. But its sometimes yields more struggles for <br/>\none, than it does for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let this conversation sound like one person has a bed of roses and <br/>\nanother doesn&#39;t. We all have our hurdles to jump. Some people have big <br/>\nones, and some have smaller ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes one side can&#39;t relate to the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nregards,<br/>\nkolleen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31757,"nextTopicId":31714}}
