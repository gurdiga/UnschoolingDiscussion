Homeschoolers are not all white middle-class<br/>\nsuburbanites. We are all colors of the rainbow, from every  socio-economic<br/>\nstrata, from all over the country and throughout the world. We are college<br/>\neducated, high-school graduates, doctors of philosophy, beauty school<br/>\ngraduates, farmers, and mechanics (among others). We are male and female. We<br/>\nare married and single. We are employed outside our homes...or not. We are<br/>\nevery religion and belief system imaginable. But the one thing that we have<br/>\nin common is a loving concern for our children that was strong enough for us<br/>\nto decide to take their educational future into our hands. Most of us did<br/>\nnot remove our children from public school as much to get them &quot;away&quot; from<br/>\nthings, as to move them toward things....things like acceptance for people<br/>\nas they are, not for what they have...things like exploring the world and<br/>\ngathering the knowledge therein for the joy of it, not for a letter<br/>\ngrade...things like getting to truly know themselves as valuable people,<br/>\neven if they are not &quot;team players&quot;....things like having a mind open to new<br/>\nideas and new people,no matter where they live, or what accent they have, or<br/>\nhow they earn their living, or where they or their ancestors were born. At<br/>\nleast these are some of the things that we hope our children will gain from<br/>\nour decision to homeschool them. Otherwise, what&#39;s it all for? So the<br/>\nimplication that &quot;some&quot; people haven&#39;t the motivation or ability or caring<br/>\nto homeschool disturbed me deeply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can do better than this, folks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe MUST do better than this.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Melissa Wood &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bbsmum@...\">bbsmum@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, September 04, 2000 2:18 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Spanking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been on this group for a while and have just read everyone&#39;s post<br/>\nand I<br/>\n&gt; am appalled at what I have been reading.  I joined to get ideas and help<br/>\nwith<br/>\n&gt; unschooling my child.  Some of the name calling I have read is childish.<br/>\nI know<br/>\n&gt; that everyone has different opinions on spanking and abuse.  It is a very<br/>\n&gt; difficult subject for everyone to discuss, but come on.  As far as someone<br/>\nwho<br/>\n&gt; is a &quot;hick&quot; and someone can&#39;t believe they actually homeschool.  As far as<br/>\nI am<br/>\n&gt; concerned, the Lord has directed me  to homeschool.  You have to be an<br/>\n&gt; intelligent, loving parent to want to stay home with your child and be in<br/>\ncharge<br/>\n&gt; of their future as far as working at McDonald&#39;s or as an attorney.  To do<br/>\nsuch<br/>\n&gt; an important and amazing thing, you are by far, not a &quot;hick&quot;.  To even<br/>\ndecide to<br/>\n&gt; do this, you are in a way, above others who don&#39;t.  All of us on here care<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; our children.  I am not saying we are better than anyone else.  We just<br/>\nlove our<br/>\n&gt; children.  Therefore, this list should be a loving helpful group of<br/>\nfriends who<br/>\n&gt; talk about how there day is going and an occasional debate is fine, but<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; name calling is for the public school system.  We should all be there for<br/>\neach<br/>\n&gt; other and help with the day to day problems of homeschooling.  How would<br/>\nyou<br/>\n&gt; look to your kids if they got on here and read the name calling?  Would<br/>\nyou not<br/>\n&gt; set such a sorry example for them?  Just speaking my opinion.  Tired of<br/>\nthe junk<br/>\n&gt; I am reading.

I wouldn&#39;t stop screaming and flinging<br/>\nblood<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all over the bathroom. She spanked me sharply and I immediately calmed<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was glad she did it.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and the problem with having such strong emotions is?????  Also the<br/>\nproblem<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with having blood in the bathroom is???? So what, there&#39;s blood in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bathroom... Ah, just like another mother I know, maybe your mother<br/>\ndidn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; want to have to clean it up and all her control issues came to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; surface...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Very classic Psychology 101,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dawn F<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; No, no, no.....you&#39;re not getting it. I was hysterical. I needed to hold<br/>\n&gt; &gt; still so she could stop the bleeding. I couldn&#39;t even hear her saying<br/>\n&quot;Stop!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hold still!&quot; over my own frightened screaming. (I cut myself trying to<br/>\nmake<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lunch.) She gave me one simple stinging swat on the tush and it brought<br/>\nme<br/>\n&gt; &gt; back to earth. She didn&#39;t care about cleaning up the mess. She knew she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needed to stop the bleeding. And she was certainly used to my strong<br/>\n&gt; &gt; emotions. If she had had a problem with that, I would have received a<br/>\nlot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; more than 3 spankings in my entire life. Not a control issue at all,<br/>\nunless<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you count first-aid as a control issue. The spanking was a simple<br/>\nattention<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getter. No ill effects and no therapy needed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ----Valerie<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Message boards, timely articles, a free newsletter and more!<br/>\n&gt; Check it all out at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com\">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Addresses:<br/>\n&gt; Post message: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Unsubscribe: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List owner: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom-owner@egroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; List settings page: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom\">http://www.egroups.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12595,"nextTopicId":12685}}
