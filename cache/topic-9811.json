She would probably have a reason <br/>\nsuch as &quot;this show is about other people not me&quot;  But then the only reason <br/>\nshe has a show is because of her personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe religious bit gets me too... I&#39;m very spiritual but not religious.  What <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard her say that annoys me is that if you chose to not circumsize your <br/>\nboys, then you are fighting the Jews.  There is no medical proof that there <br/>\nis any reason to do so.  It&#39;s a custom and a cultural thing in the USA.   <br/>\nMost of Europe doesn&#39;t mutilate their boys and we don&#39;t have a higher degree <br/>\nof any kind of cancer or any other higher cases of other diseases.  When I <br/>\nwas having Zak I was in England living on an American Airforce Base and I <br/>\nchecked with both countries research and many many organizations.  Even the <br/>\ndoctors who were present at the birth of my friend&#39;s baby said to me in the <br/>\ndelivery room &quot;well there&#39;s really no need to do it, but men like it done <br/>\nbecause it makes men and their sons look the same&quot;.  When I asked my husband <br/>\nhow often he looks at another man&#39;s penis and if that&#39;s normal practice he <br/>\nlaughed and said most men avoid looking at each other in the bathrooms and <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t stare at each others body parts... Anyway I digress....  The <br/>\npoint is... I heard her say that anyone who didn&#39;t circumsize their boys was <br/>\njust looking for a way to oppress the Jews.... I never realized until I came <br/>\nto America that religion was such a big deal in this country so I guess <br/>\nthat&#39;s the sort of comment I could expect from her.  I think it&#39;s great that <br/>\nthere are tons of religions and that people have something to believe in, if <br/>\nit works for them...  But supressing the Jews.....
