I also included it as the THIRD <br/>\noption after locals and established umbrellas and I admit I got messy, <br/>\nlinguistically!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor any folks who are curious:<br/>\n1.) The credentialed tutor option is very rarely done, I think because of <br/>\nits expense.<br/>\n2.) The public-school-at-home option isn&#39;t seen as &#39;real&#39; homeschooling in <br/>\nsome quarters as the children are public school students. It usually isn&#39;t <br/>\nvery unschooler friendly.<br/>\n3.) The private-school-at-home/ISP option is done but sometimes is viewed <br/>\nmuch as #2.<br/>\n4.) Declaring yourself a private school (R-4) is very frequently done by <br/>\ncali families and is very unschooler friendly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn non-cali unschooler looking for a way to unschool kids she is <br/>\nresponsible for, but under her states law is stymied because she&#39;s not the <br/>\nblood-mother, wouldn&#39;t be interested in 1, 2 or 3.  They wouldn&#39;t do her <br/>\nany good.  Option four, now...umbrella-ing...  That could work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I listed the one that could work and is most frequently used by <br/>\nunschooling families.  I do apologize for misleading folks into thinking <br/>\nthat it&#39;s the ONLY way to homeschool here in Cali, it just seems to be the <br/>\nmost common way and the way most likely to help the searching mum.  I <br/>\nshould have said &#39;usually&#39; instead of &#39;has to&#39;.  Consider me linguistically <br/>\nchastened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in Cali and I&#39;ve declared.  In the past, as a very exclusive private <br/>\nschool we&#39;ve umbrella&#39;d the child of a friend who wished to stay below the <br/>\nradar.<br/>\nNo fuss, no muss.<br/>\nHeidiWD</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":93936,"nextTopicId":93954}}
