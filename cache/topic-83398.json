The only thing I really <br/>\nmissed that I regret is homebirth-I admire you for that.  All of my children were <br/>\nborn prematurely to some extent so it was too dangerous for me, so I was told, <br/>\nand really don&#39;t doubt it, but wish it could have been different.  I don&#39;t <br/>\ndwell on it, though. I am happy for you that you got to experience that.  I did <br/>\nthe same thing with breastfeeding-waited for my child to move on instead of <br/>\nrejecting him (what else could you call it?) and boy was my MIL unhappy about <br/>\nthat.  I am so glad God gave me a strong personality and the ability from day one <br/>\nnot to care too much what people think of me.

Next week I am <br/>\ngiving away my textbooks that we never use anyway unless my son thinks there <br/>\nis something interesting and of value in keeping them.  It is, after all, HIS <br/>\neducation, not mine.  And I feel like we are bonding quite more firmly, <br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve been able to spend time learning about him, instead of teaching him so <br/>\nmany things I learned in school that I&#39;d forgotten and are so insignificant in <br/>\nlife in general.
