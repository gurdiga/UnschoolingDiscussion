He was the best father in the world.  <br/>\nHe had five children, worked full time, yet found time to have an individual <br/>\nrelationship with each of us.  He was a very good artist, constantly drawing <br/>\nour &quot;requests&quot; from cartoon characters to real looking people and animals.  <br/>\nSadly, I don&#39;t have one single example.  I guess I thought he&#39;d be here <br/>\ndrawing for me forever.  He also liked to make up silly songs and poems, and <br/>\nsome of these I still remember.  I remember sitting on his lap as he <br/>\npatiently taught me to tie flies (for fly fishing).  We&#39;d take long walks in <br/>\nthe woods and spend quiet afternoons fishing.  He&#39;d read to us at night and <br/>\npoint out the reindeer tracks on the roof.  He&#39;d take me to work and show me <br/>\nhow the lin-o-type presses operated and was proud that I could read upside <br/>\ndown and backwards, too.  He apologized when he was wrong.  He was my taxi <br/>\nservice until I was old enough to get my own car, which he helped me pick <br/>\nout.  He loved my kids for the few short years he knew them.  He never met my <br/>\nyoungest, his namesake.  Just a few years ago my sisters and I were <br/>\nreminiscing, and I told my secret:  I always felt that I was his favorite.  <br/>\nThey admitted that each of them thought that THEY were his favorite.  I think <br/>\nthat it&#39;s remarkable that he could enjoy each of his children so much, and <br/>\nlovingly show that, so that without the words, we still each believed we were <br/>\nhis favorite.  I try to be the best mother I can, because I had the best <br/>\nfather.<br/>\nMary J</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58931,"nextTopicId":58942}}
