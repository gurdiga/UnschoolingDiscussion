The new element has been named<br/>\n&quot;Governmentium&quot;.  Governmentium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75<br/>\ndeputy neutrons,<br/>\nand 224 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an Atomic mass of 311.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese 311 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are<br/>\nsurrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.  Since<br/>\nGovernmentium has no electrons, it is inert.  However, it can be detected,<br/>\nas it<br/>\nimpedes every reaction with which it comes into contact.
