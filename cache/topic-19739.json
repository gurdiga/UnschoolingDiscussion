My glands finally aren&#39;t<br/>\nswollen anymore and my fever FINALLY went away. I twas<br/>\nonly there off and on for like three dayz....(but then<br/>\nthere is that whole loss of concept of time when you<br/>\nhave a fever...)...but that was QUITE enough. I now<br/>\nhave this ANNOYING cough and stuffed/runny nose that<br/>\nweren&#39;t there with the fever and aches, and I almost<br/>\nwish I could switch back to the easier part...being<br/>\nthe fever/aches...cuz now I FEEL better, but every<br/>\ntime I try to talk or laugh or DO anything I go into a<br/>\ncoughing fit. UGGGGHHH!!! <br/>\nI just drank alot of echinacea/elderberry tea and took<br/>\nloads and loads of vitamin C and garlic and took lots<br/>\nand lots of baths. Oh heavenly baths. What world the<br/>\nworld be without them. Oh, and rested. I have this pet<br/>\npeeve, or theory or whatever you want to call it. If<br/>\nyou are really sick. Stop. Let yourself be sick. and<br/>\nGet over it. Most people in my family are obsessive<br/>\n&quot;get-things-done&quot;ers and therefore they never truly<br/>\nget a sickness out of their system until it finally<br/>\ncatches up with them and knocks them flat on their<br/>\nbutts for not taking a day or two off and resting<br/>\nsooner. So if that&#39;s possible for you, I highly<br/>\nrecommend it.
