They don&#39;t seem &quot;equipped&quot; to deal with a variety of<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample, (I worked for 3 different school districts and hubby worked for yet<br/>\nanother so we have dozens of these experiences) a young teacher fresh out of<br/>\ncollege is given a class of 8th graders.  In ps this is a very agressive<br/>\nage.  This teacher (22) was tiny, &quot;cute&quot; and had a &quot;little&quot; voice.  She was<br/>\nNOT an alpha person.  That class was a free for all and by the end of the<br/>\nfirst quarter she was handing out cinch notices left and right and flunking<br/>\nmore than 75% of the class.  IMNSHO, *if* she as going to teach she should<br/>\nhave started out with K and then worked her way up if she wanted to teach<br/>\nthe older kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother teacher at this same school wanted to be &quot;one of the girls&quot; and be<br/>\n&quot;friends&quot; with all the girls in her class.  When one of the girls didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to be her friend or if one of the boys acted out, she would sit in the<br/>\nteacher&#39;s lounge and cry!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you have to figure in the fact that the majority of ps graduates<br/>\nend up having to take remedial math and English classes.  How are they going<br/>\nto teach that which they didn&#39;t grasp themselves to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF it should ever come to pass that I am forced to send the kidlets to ps,<br/>\nthen they will go to the local &quot;one room school house&quot; where my cousin sends<br/>\nher daughter!  This woman rents a big 3 bedroom house and that is her<br/>\n&quot;school house.&quot;  She has 20 students.  There are two teachers.  The kids<br/>\nrange in age from her 4 yo to 18.  Everything they do is either hands on or<br/>\nvery inventive.  For example, they studied the U.S. political system last<br/>\nyear.  Along with reading, they watched tons of videos, CNN, etc. and went<br/>\nto school board meetings, city council meetings and board of supervisor<br/>\nmeetings. They went to town hall meetings and to political rallies.  They<br/>\nalso did a fundraiser and they all went to Washington, D.C.<br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rumpleteasermom@...\">rumpleteasermom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 21, 2002 8:01 AM<br/>\nSubject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: dumbing down TV (was RE: Covering the<br/>\nbasics)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally think this is a symptom of public school dependency.

We have just recently started watching satelite tv.  I am appalled at how *stupid* everything has gotten over the last few years!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that every program has to be *fun*, *exciting*, *mysterious*, or something.  Take Jepardy for instance.  The questions have gotten way easier and they&#39;ve added a &quot;clue crew&quot; to make the show more appealing???? When I turned it on the other night, a blond girl (no slight intended) comes on holding a yard sale sign and says something like &quot;tonight we&#39;re going to a yard sale!&quot; in her sweetest dumb blond voice (believe me I&#39;m trying to phrase this right because I&#39;m blond, but you know what I mean!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we try to watch documentaries on Discovery or TLC or whatever.  Most are alot of hype about nothing.  All designed to *entertain* us.  Is it not possible that some people out there are simply interested in things and like learning something new?  We watched a show about Neanderthals ( a family favorite in our house) with my 3 sons aged 5, 7 and 11.  They began talking about how the Neanderthals interbred with homeosapians (fasinating no?) Then the guy comes on and says &quot;SEX, they we&#39;re having SEX, yes SEX (emphais his not mine)!  Was that necessary to keep me watching?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have commented to my husband that we keep getting dumber and dumber.  People knew way more about more in general before.  Now we have to change the questions on Jepardy, and make documentaries full of nothing.  Where will we be 50 years from now?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust recently, we purchased a new trivial pursuit game (first in about 8 years).  We couldn&#39;t believe how they dumbed down the questions there too!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs the love of knowledge a dying thing?
