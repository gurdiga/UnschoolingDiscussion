He can not live his whole life in our<br/>\nhouse in front of the computer or playing his games with friends.<br/>\nLeft to his own, this is what he will do, however.  We have joined a<br/>\nhomeschool group and we are starting to plan field trips, so this will<br/>\nhelp.

The<br/>\nmore you understand unschooling the more you&#39;ll see how mind and spirit<br/>\nnumbing school is.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have been considering homeschooling and have done a good deal of<br/>\nreading because before we found the charter school, my son was<br/>\nstarting to have a good deal of trouble in school.  I knew it was not<br/>\ngoing to work for him to give him a lot of books to read and expect<br/>\nhim to learn, he can not do that very well at all.  I started looking<br/>\nin to several options, and decided to unschool, hoping he would take<br/>\nthis as an opportunity to do things his way.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key element of successful unschooling is trusting your child.  Trust<br/>\nthat they can and will learn.  Learning is like breathing, can&#39;t be<br/>\nstopped.  My opinion is that a majority of the time spent &quot;deschooling&quot;<br/>\nis the child testing the parents, &quot;Are they REALLY gonna let me do this?&quot;<br/>\n Who can blame them for resenting and even fighting against being forced<br/>\nand judged by the school system?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have not pressured him<br/>\na great deal about it so far, but am concerned that he is not real<br/>\nwilling to do much more than play games.  (computer and D&D type roll<br/>\nplay)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs long as we see books and lessons as learning we miss the value gained<br/>\nin other activities.  If you&#39;re able to truly see the value in what he IS<br/>\ndoing you&#39;ll be able to let go of the old ideas.  Math, science,<br/>\nlanguage, etc. are all tools and to be used for our purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tell my daughter to follow her passions and use whatever tools she<br/>\nneeds to do so.  One of her passions is Pokemon card game play and for<br/>\nthis she uses math, logic, strategy, language, reading and discipline. <br/>\nBecause she uses these tools in way they are allies and friendly thus she<br/>\nis more confident in using them in other and new passions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;This is all he talks about and all he wants to do.  He has<br/>\nalways been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>\nmoment.  I asked him to figure a tip for me at a restaurant Sunday and<br/>\nhe could not even do that.  It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>\non the subject.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school things like math become a chore, knowledge with no purpose<br/>\nexcept but being regurgitated for testing.  My daughter can do complex<br/>\ncalculations for her real life endeavors but if they were put on paper<br/>\nand tested she would freeze up.  It may take time for your son to see<br/>\nmath as a friendly tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately your son&#39;s learning problems belong to him and he will learn<br/>\nhow to find ways to compensate.  A friend with dyslexia, after years of<br/>\nstruggling in the &quot;school&quot; way,  finally taught himself to read and study<br/>\nin his late teens and managed to graduate college with a master&#39;s degree.<br/>\n Now I realize that most of us are capable of doing the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy place as parent is to give support and demonstrate my faith in them. <br/>\nWhen kids are given the message that they can&#39;t be trusted to learn they<br/>\nusually rise no further than that.  My opinion is that this is the MAIN<br/>\nproblem with any school, kids are told when and how to learn and then<br/>\ntested to make sure they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

He is 13, and we started homeschooling in Feb.<br/>\n&gt; of this year.  He attended traditional public school until the 4th<br/>\n&gt; grade, then moved to a charter school for the 5th and 6th grade.  The<br/>\n&gt; charter school was a good move in a lot of ways, but not without<br/>\n&gt; problems.  My son is a very visual learner and the school incorperated<br/>\n&gt; art into the core subjects which gave him other ways to &quot;see&quot; the<br/>\n&gt; information.  The classes were 15 or less and thy always had an art<br/>\n&gt; assistant assigned to help the instructor.  It worked quite well for<br/>\n&gt; him, but lack of funding and lack of discipline is killing this<br/>\n&gt; school.  It has become the county wide dumping ground for problem<br/>\n&gt; students and has become quite rough because of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We decided to move to a location outside the metro Atlanta area this<br/>\n&gt; past summer, which put Nick (my son) in a very large Jr. High school.<br/>\n&gt; At the same time, he decided he wanted to join the football team,<br/>\n&gt; which has been a dream of his for a while.  We agreed, he tried out<br/>\n&gt; and made the team.  The understanding was that practice would be 4<br/>\n&gt; nights a week for the first few weeks before school started and then<br/>\n&gt; would go to 2 nights a week after.  This did not happen, and we stayed<br/>\n&gt; on a 4 night a week practice schedule (from 6:00 pm until 8:30 pm)<br/>\n&gt; with a game on Saturday.  I asked my son to quit as this was to much,<br/>\n&gt; but he really wanted to keep going.  This proved to be to much for<br/>\n&gt; him, as I thought it would.  Not only was he in a great deal of shock<br/>\n&gt; from returning to &quot;regular&quot; classes, but he had no time for a life.<br/>\n&gt; He ran home from school did homework, went to practice, then straight<br/>\n&gt; to bed with barely time to eat or say hello to his friends or family.<br/>\n&gt; By the time Sunday rolled around, he was so behind in his homework he<br/>\n&gt; had to spend the day working on that and still had no free time.n He<br/>\n&gt; started having trouble sleeping in September and again, I wanted him<br/>\n&gt; to quit the team.  He was insistant that he wanted to continue and my<br/>\n&gt; husband reluctantly agreed.  HIs grades were really bad, as would be<br/>\n&gt; expected, but his teaching team agreed with him that removing him from<br/>\n&gt; the team would not be good, since he wanted it so badly.  He started<br/>\n&gt; missing school because he was not feeling well most of the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In November he developed daily migrain type headaches and had to leave<br/>\n&gt; the team.  He started missing school 2 or 3 days a week and when he<br/>\n&gt; was able to attend his headaches were so bad he could not participate<br/>\n&gt; in class.  We went to a total of 7 physicians and 1 psychologist<br/>\n&gt; trying to determine the cause of the headaches.  I will not even begin<br/>\n&gt; to tell you what we all went through here, but school became a very<br/>\n&gt; small priority to us.  Football was out, and Nick did not even argue<br/>\n&gt; about it.  (thankfully)  By the end of January my son, who has always<br/>\n&gt; been an A/B student was failing the 7th grade and we were thinking of<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling as an aletrnative.  During this time, the school tested<br/>\n&gt; my son for learning disabilities and discovered he has some reading<br/>\n&gt; and language problems, not surprising to me, he was almost totally a<br/>\n&gt; visual learner, and also that he was suffering a great deal from<br/>\n&gt; stress.  We all decided that homeschool would best serve his needs and<br/>\n&gt; with the school&#39;s blessing, we took him out of school.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been considering homeschooling and have done a good deal of<br/>\n&gt; reading because before we found the charter school, my son was<br/>\n&gt; starting to have a good deal of trouble in school.

It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>\n&gt; on the subject.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He will write, however, to some extent.  He is playing in a game with<br/>\n&gt; a friend&#39;s family and the kids get extra experience if the journal<br/>\n&gt; their character&#39;s life outside the game.  He has written one paper and<br/>\n&gt; is working on the second.  They are not extensive, but they are<br/>\n&gt; something.  Of course, they take him forever to accomplish due to his<br/>\n&gt; problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, I have no idea of how to help him with his learning problems.  I<br/>\n&gt; am not really a good teacher, I lose patience and focus a lot and am<br/>\n&gt; very disorganized.  My husband would be great, but he is away from<br/>\n&gt; home enough that he is really unable to participate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been following this list for some time, but was waiting for all<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;discussion&quot; to calm down before I approached you with questions.<br/>\n&gt; I really did not want to fan the flames any further.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Don&#39;t expect him to have recovered from school <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s been doing something different for nine months.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it will speed the process if you stop talking about school, stop talking <br/>\nabout &quot;subject matter,&quot; stop measuring and poking and checking him every day <br/>\nor two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a cake&#39;s going to be in the oven for 45 minutes, it does NO good (and in <br/>\nfact does harm) to start opening the oven and sticking toothpicks in it at <br/>\nfive minutes, seven minutes, ten minutes, twelve minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeave him alone about school.<br/>\nBut enrich his life with thought-expanding input.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the movies, they don&#39;t have to be classic stories, either.  Maybe the 100 <br/>\ntop movies of all time (a list that came out a few years back) would be a <br/>\nstarting place.  Or maybe your video store has an Academy Award section.   <br/>\nBut you could go for any kind of theme or experimental pattern.  Holly&#39;s <br/>\nliking musicals from the 1930s and has become a big Judy Garland fan.  It&#39;s <br/>\nfun to find &quot;first of&quot; things, like Willow had morphing (and the DVD has a <br/>\nbit about how they did it).  One of the Sinbad movies from the 70&#39;s had <br/>\nclaymation (or some figure-animation) interacting with the characters.    You <br/>\ncould follow one actor, or focus on war movies for a while, or stuff about <br/>\nRome.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t treat it as a chore, treat it as a vacation!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":55326806,"authorName":"rumpleteasermom","from":"&quot;rumpleteasermom&quot; &lt;rumpleteasermom@...&gt;","profile":"rumpleteasermom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: I need help with Unschooling a 13 year old - quite long, sorry.","postDate":"1019568625","msgId":35711,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFhM25saCs2azVwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdna2FjdWdvOW9xOHVwaHZxczY4NWozajJla2NzNGdwYXJANGF4LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35708,"nextInTopic":35735,"prevInTime":35710,"nextInTime":35712,"topicId":35708,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Vaidas was on the B-Ball team and quit because his grades <br/>\nwere falling.  Now he&#39;s in Tennis and it&#39;s the same thing all over <br/>\nagain.  Practice or matches every night.  The only day off is Sunday. <br/>\n It sucketh!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to your son, he really needs some time to unwind and allow <br/>\nthe headaches to become a distant memory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but am concerned that he is not real<br/>\n&gt; willing to do much more than play games.  <br/>\n&gt; (computer and D&D type roll<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s playing D&D he&#39;s getting math.  But beyond that, don&#39;t even <br/>\nworry about it right now.  When he needs it he&#39;ll learn it.  D&D has <br/>\nalso led my girls into a lot of stuff about medieval history <br/>\n(mostly the weaponry) and folklore in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d have to know more about the learning problems to help with that, <br/>\nbut for the most part, I think a lot of the stuff the schools worry <br/>\nabout can be safely ignored IRL.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther ideas for you: <br/>\nTalk to him a lot.  Ask him what kind of things he&#39;s interested in, <br/>\nwhere he&#39;d like to go.  Then find things that match that you can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind other unschoolers and homeschoolers in your area that he can <br/>\nrelate to.  This may take some time and effort.  I&#39;ve been looking for <br/>\n7 years and only just this year found exactly what we wanted.  But the <br/>\nsearch was worth it and was an adventure in and of itself.  My girls <br/>\nlearned a lot obout individuality in the process and are quite content <br/>\nwith who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t push the reading thing.  My ds HATED reading, until he found out <br/>\nhe could read books about motors and trains and stuff.  Now he loves <br/>\nreading best of all.  So explore that avenue a little, maybe get some <br/>\nrole playing game manuals and stuff like that for him to read.  But <br/>\ndon&#39;t present them as reading material.  Present them as an <br/>\nextenuation of his interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nBridget</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99340477,"authorName":"CopperScaleDragon","from":"CopperScaleDragon &lt;CopperScaleDragon@...&gt;","profile":"copperscaledragon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"I need help with Unschooling a 13 year old - quite long, sorry.","postDate":"1019567141","msgId":35708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdna2FjdWdvOW9xOHVwaHZxczY4NWozajJla2NzNGdwYXJANGF4LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35711,"prevInTime":35707,"nextInTime":35709,"topicId":35708,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am really concerned for my son s will to learn some things and to accept challenges without being told.

He is 13, and we started homeschooling in Feb.<br/>\nof this year.  He attended traditional public school until the 4th<br/>\ngrade, then moved to a charter school for the 5th and 6th grade.  The<br/>\ncharter school was a good move in a lot of ways, but not without<br/>\nproblems.  My son is a very visual learner and the school incorperated<br/>\nart into the core subjects which gave him other ways to &quot;see&quot; the<br/>\ninformation.  The classes were 15 or less and thy always had an art<br/>\nassistant assigned to help the instructor.  It worked quite well for<br/>\nhim, but lack of funding and lack of discipline is killing this<br/>\nschool.  It has become the county wide dumping ground for problem<br/>\nstudents and has become quite rough because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to move to a location outside the metro Atlanta area this<br/>\npast summer, which put Nick (my son) in a very large Jr. High school.<br/>\nAt the same time, he decided he wanted to join the football team,<br/>\nwhich has been a dream of his for a while.  We agreed, he tried out<br/>\nand made the team.  The understanding was that practice would be 4<br/>\nnights a week for the first few weeks before school started and then<br/>\nwould go to 2 nights a week after.  This did not happen, and we stayed<br/>\non a 4 night a week practice schedule (from 6:00 pm until 8:30 pm)<br/>\nwith a game on Saturday.  I asked my son to quit as this was to much,<br/>\nbut he really wanted to keep going.  This proved to be to much for<br/>\nhim, as I thought it would.  Not only was he in a great deal of shock<br/>\nfrom returning to &quot;regular&quot; classes, but he had no time for a life.<br/>\nHe ran home from school did homework, went to practice, then straight<br/>\nto bed with barely time to eat or say hello to his friends or family.<br/>\nBy the time Sunday rolled around, he was so behind in his homework he<br/>\nhad to spend the day working on that and still had no free time.n He<br/>\nstarted having trouble sleeping in September and again, I wanted him<br/>\nto quit the team.  He was insistant that he wanted to continue and my<br/>\nhusband reluctantly agreed.  HIs grades were really bad, as would be<br/>\nexpected, but his teaching team agreed with him that removing him from<br/>\nthe team would not be good, since he wanted it so badly.  He started<br/>\nmissing school because he was not feeling well most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn November he developed daily migrain type headaches and had to leave<br/>\nthe team.  He started missing school 2 or 3 days a week and when he<br/>\nwas able to attend his headaches were so bad he could not participate<br/>\nin class.  We went to a total of 7 physicians and 1 psychologist<br/>\ntrying to determine the cause of the headaches.  I will not even begin<br/>\nto tell you what we all went through here, but school became a very<br/>\nsmall priority to us.  Football was out, and Nick did not even argue<br/>\nabout it.  (thankfully)  By the end of January my son, who has always<br/>\nbeen an A/B student was failing the 7th grade and we were thinking of<br/>\nhomeschooling as an aletrnative.  During this time, the school tested<br/>\nmy son for learning disabilities and discovered he has some reading<br/>\nand language problems, not surprising to me, he was almost totally a<br/>\nvisual learner, and also that he was suffering a great deal from<br/>\nstress.  We all decided that homeschool would best serve his needs and<br/>\nwith the school&#39;s blessing, we took him out of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been considering homeschooling and have done a good deal of<br/>\nreading because before we found the charter school, my son was<br/>\nstarting to have a good deal of trouble in school.  I knew it was not<br/>\ngoing to work for him to give him a lot of books to read and expect<br/>\nhim to learn, he can not do that very well at all.  I started looking<br/>\nin to several options, and decided to unschool, hoping he would take<br/>\nthis as an opportunity to do things his way.  I have not pressured him<br/>\na great deal about it so far, but am concerned that he is not real<br/>\nwilling to do much more than play games.  (computer and D&D type roll<br/>\nplay)  This is all he talks about and all he wants to do.  He has<br/>\nalways been very quick at math, but he will not look at math at the<br/>\nmoment.  I asked him to figure a tip for me at a restaraunt Sunday and<br/>\nhe could not even do that.  It is like he has forgotten all he knows<br/>\non the subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe will write, however, to some extent.  He is playing in a game with<br/>\na friend&#39;s family and the kids get extra experience if the journal<br/>\ntheir character&#39;s life outside the game.  He has written one paper and<br/>\nis working on the second.  They are not extensive, but they are<br/>\nsomething.  Of course, they take him forever to accomplish due to his<br/>\nproblems.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have no idea of how to help him with his learning problems.  I<br/>\nam not really a good teacher, I lose patience and focus a lot and am<br/>\nvery disorganized.  My husband would be great, but he is away from<br/>\nhome enough that he is really unable to participate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been following this list for some time, but was waiting for all<br/>\nthe &quot;discussion&quot; to calm down before I approached you with questions.<br/>\nI really did not want to fan the flames any further.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.  How do you motivate a teen?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJane</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36097,"nextTopicId":36062}}
