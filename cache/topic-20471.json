Like when we first move to a new location (we move a LOT) and everyone asks DS","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1051304511\">We use the name Brownville Academy as our &#39;school&#39; name when it seems<br/>\nhelpful.  Like when we first move to a new location (we move a LOT) and<br/>\neveryone asks DS where he goes to school.  He used to say &#39;I don&#39;t go to<br/>\nschool&#39; but I had a hard time with all the questions that raised.  I simply<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the energy to answer all the busy bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he says something like &#39;Brownville Academy&#39;.   Which usually leads to a<br/>\ncomment about never hearing of that school and he responds that it&#39;s a very<br/>\nexclusive school...so exclusive that he&#39;s the only student!...and tells them<br/>\nhe homeschools.  From there we either get responses or questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found the whole exchange to be much more pleasant since we started<br/>\ndoing this.  Those folks that assume homeschool means school at home also<br/>\nassume we have a rigorous academic schedule and very high standards and they<br/>\nare satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers who are interested in what home education is like will ask questions<br/>\nand are usually jealous.  (It still amazes me how many people give me the &#39;I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t stand to be around my children that many hours&#39; type of comment.<br/>\nMy response to that is that I&#39;m a jealous mom.  I like my child and love to<br/>\nbe with him!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has also been helpful to have a school name when requesting information<br/>\nor discounts.  With computers so available, it&#39;s really easy to create<br/>\nletterhead, for instance.  When we first began homeschooling, I would have<br/>\nhad to get letterhead printed.  Now, just run it off the computer as<br/>\nneeded...not that it&#39;s needed very often, but it&#39;s a nice tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting to ramble...sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nEiraul<br/>\n<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Brownville77@...\">Brownville77@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Vaughnde Edwards&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stampinbookworm@...\">stampinbookworm@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: May 04, 2001 10:44 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Registering as private school question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I went ahead and registered ours as Edwards Christian Homeschool at<br/>\nWaldenbooks so we could get the 25% discount on all our books<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Vaughnde Lee<br/>\n&gt; Missoula, Montana<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com\">http://www.stampinbookworm.eboard.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;   From: Jeanmarie Shingleton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Jmarie_s02qlt@...\">Jmarie_s02qlt@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Date: Friday, May 04, 2001 11:37 AM<br/>\n&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Registering as private school question<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   We&#39;ve thought about actually giving ourselves a name so we can take<br/>\n&gt;   advantage of some the the perks like freebies offered to schools, but we<br/>\n(my<br/>\n&gt;   son and I) haven&#39;t taken the time to actually do it. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valfitz@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"0y1eKA7kb6PciXBNb3vW2iaL-4WbLpnRxK4qSF0gLkJOYZPVKjarDLFPseuIsLteSlgb5Gyj8li6_DfWnA8V50oVHp4","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Registering as private school question","postDate":"989039266","msgId":20539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlkMDFyMiszMDBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYyMDhyWFE3ZXRGa2VzeFNOTGMwMDAwNTE4N0Bob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":20474,"nextInTopic":20622,"prevInTime":20538,"nextInTime":20540,"topicId":20471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Laurie named our school, Holt-Neill High  I bet you can guess where that name came from.. love, Valerie ... to let the ...
