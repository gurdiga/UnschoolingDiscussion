We just went with his interests and expanded as he grew. Over<br/>\ntime, we have completely immersed ourselves in trucks, planes, knights,<br/>\ndinosaurs and ancient Egypt, (to name a few). It occurred to me that we<br/>\nshould keep this going and I started doing all the reading I could about<br/>\nhomeshooling. The more I read, the more I&#39;m convinced it is the way to go<br/>\nfor our family. Alex has always been extremely &quot;reserved&quot; with outsiders<br/>\nand has insisted since he could talk that he did not want to go to<br/>\nschool.  I think he would have been a basket case this past year if he<br/>\nwas forced to attend kindergarten and his incredibly bright, inquisitive<br/>\nmind would have gotten lost in the process. Also, I want to preserve my<br/>\nchildrens sense of self.  they are wonderful people and they need to<br/>\ndevelop and grow at their own pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How many children do you have? \t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>\t2, a boy and a girl<br/>\n\tAlex, age 5 (6 in July) and Sean Marie age 2 1/2<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What are your children&#39;s most recent interests?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I listed a lot of Alex&#39;s above. He also has become passionate about<br/>\nswimming and hopefully will take lessons soon. He has never liked<br/>\nparticipating in class settings or without me, but he seems to be<br/>\nevolving from that stage and is almost ready to try a class out.  Sean<br/>\nMarie at this point pretty much follows her brothers interests, but she<br/>\nhas shown to have a natural way with animals. She also loves to dress up,<br/>\ndance and generally be a whirl wind of activity. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What area does your family live in?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>About an hour north of Chicago, IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you have any pets?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh yes:  1 dog, 3 cats and 66 rats.  I have a &quot;pet rat rescue&quot; or<br/>\nshelter, taking in unwanted rats and trying to find them homes. Many end<br/>\nup spending their lives with us. I have a web site at<br/>\nwww.geocities.com/pet_rat_rescue <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anything else you would like to add?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have had a &quot;family bed&quot; since Alex was 2 months old. We all like this<br/>\narrangement and I am steeling myself for the day when the kids tell me<br/>\nthey want to sleep in their own rooms.  I did not nurse my children<br/>\n(gasp) for medical and personal reasons and we are as close as any mother<br/>\nand her children can be. Everything is what you make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are irreligious but moral, good people and intellectually interested<br/>\nin all religions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a dream to someday live on many acres with many animals (well,<br/>\nthat last part is my dream).  I loved hearing about you &quot;farmers&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents about the TV thing.  My mantra is &quot;all things in<br/>\nmoderation&quot;.  TV&#39;s do have an off button, ours spends most of its time in<br/>\nthat state.  There is A LOT of crap out their but we don&#39;t watch it.  We<br/>\nenjoy the goodies on PBS, Discovery etc.  My kids know when the TV gets<br/>\nturned off it stays off.  From not being exposed to mindless crap (which<br/>\nI&#39;d include lots of kids programing) they don&#39;t have much interest in it.<br/>\nExcept Pokemon, but everybody has their faults, I myself am an X Files<br/>\njunky. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for going on so long, hope I didn&#39;t sound too defensive.&gt; ~ Shelley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9522,"nextTopicId":9521}}
