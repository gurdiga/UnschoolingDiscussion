It was hard the weeks afterwards. Thanks <br/>\nto friends who work with La Leche League, I was able to get back in <br/>\ntrack with it. Same with Aidan. We have an ultrasound with him <br/>\nsucking his fore and middle fingers; he sucked his fingers minutes <br/>\nafter he was born but latching on was a huge undertaking. It was <br/>\nreally difficult to the point that I developed mastitis for several <br/>\ntimes and got really sick --with both of them. The encouragement I <br/>\ngot from friends, LL-Leagers and midwives, plus my determination to <br/>\nbreast feed got me through it.  And the lactation consultants said it <br/>\n--some get it immediately, others just don&#39;t and yes, you have to <br/>\nteach babies how to latch on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, I think it is a part of evolution that, thanks to the <br/>\ntechnology and resources we have available, we are by-passing a lot <br/>\nof drama involving childbirth and newborn care. If not, Evan would <br/>\nnot have been born alive or after having Aidan I would have bled to <br/>\ndeath. Nature would have definitely dealt us a blow but thanks to <br/>\nnurture my children and I are here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nLiza<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;In a message dated 12/12/2002 11:58:13 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  In a message dated 12/12/02 9:32:29 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:liza@...\">liza@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;The fact that human babies have to learn how to suckle<br/>\n&gt;&gt;  really tells us a lot about the human animal.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Noooo!
