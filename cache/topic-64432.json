My posts are moderated, so, I apologize for the delay in <br/>\nthier transmission.. It seems like my responses are untimely since they don&#39;t <br/>\npost as soon as I send them.. Anyway, as to the rest of your question.  I do <br/>\nnot live in fear of God.  I DO believe that God has mighty, omnipotent power, <br/>\nand he CAN bring his wrath on folks if he choses.. But, he is a loving and <br/>\nforgiving God.  It is VERY much like the parent relationship you describe.  <br/>\nMy concept of God is just like the attachment parenting/unschooling ideals of <br/>\nparenting.  We are good stewards, good ministers, good people in general beca<br/>\nuse we love God, we want to please him and bring  him Joy. WHY?  Well, its <br/>\nsimple, because he first showed ( and continues showing) his love for us.  He <br/>\nis our role model.    When we are not &quot;good people&quot;, it hurts him, and it <br/>\nhurts us to be seperated from God and to cause him greif.  It is really all <br/>\nso simple.  It should be especially simple to unschooling folks.  If one has <br/>\na close, intimate relationship with God,  If one seeks him out, prays, reads <br/>\nand communes with him, then the &quot;right&quot; way is easy to see.  Just like we <br/>\ntrust our children to make the right choices because we have talked with <br/>\nthem, loved them, modeled for them,  God trusts us to do what is right  if we <br/>\nwalk and talk with him.  We &quot;are good people&quot; out of principle, not out of <br/>\nfear.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, granted, I fall VERY short of this goal often.. It seems I fall short of <br/>\nit most often on this list.  I can&#39;t say exactly why, but something &quot;here&quot; <br/>\nseems to   bring out the worst in me.   I was recently blessed to be a part <br/>\nof a physical manifestation of the love of Christ, and the love of the Body <br/>\nof Christ for others.   I suppose this spirtual renewal caused me to take <br/>\noffense at the labeling of &quot;Christians&quot; in a category with folks who <br/>\nrestrict, control, and abuse thier children.   And, that resentment caused me <br/>\nact in an un Christian manner.  I apologize for not being a better example.  <br/>\nAs I said earlier, its a continuing process to be a better person. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119296283,"authorName":"myfunny4","from":"&quot;myfunny4&quot; &lt;Debbies4@...&gt;","profile":"myfunny4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: afterlife/afterlives/today-lives","postDate":"1050264954","msgId":64699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI3Y2docStvbmNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYjMwMWMzMDFlNSRjNDIzNmI2MCQ2MTAxYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64698,"nextInTopic":64701,"prevInTime":64698,"nextInTime":64700,"topicId":64432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... bible is a ...

But they<br/>\nbelieve that it is channeled through church sacraments to sinful but<br/>\nrepentant persons. Most people, at death, go to Purgatory, which is a type<br/>\nof temporary Hell; a few go directly to Heaven; others go permanently to<br/>\nHell.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Religious liberals generally interpret hell symbolically, not as an actual<br/>\nplace. They reject the concept of a loving God creating a place of eternal<br/>\ntorment.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent status of Christianity:<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 33% of the world&#39;s population regard themselves as Christian. This<br/>\npercentage has been stable for decades. (The second most popular religion is<br/>\nIslam at about 20%. It is growing. If its present growth rate continues, it<br/>\nwill to become the dominant religion of the world during in a few decades.)<br/>\nAbout 75% of American adults and a similar number of Canadians identify<br/>\nthemselves as Christian. This number has recently been dropping about one<br/>\npercentage point per year. This is mainly due to:<br/>\n<br/>\n* The sudden increase in non-theists, such as Agnostics, Atheists,<br/>\nHumanists, etc. They are growing about one percentage point per year.<br/>\n<br/>\n* An increase in the numbers of followers of minority religions, largely<br/>\ncaused by immigration from regions of the world which are predominantly<br/>\nBuddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The emergence of new spiritual/religious movements like New Age, Wicca and<br/>\nother Neopagan religions. Wicca, for example, is doubling in size about<br/>\nevery 30 months. <br/>\n<br/>\nChristianity in North America is a severely divided faith, consisting of <br/>\nover 1,000 denominations, which are often categorized into conservative,<br/>\nmainline and liberal wings:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Many Fundamentalist and other Evangelical Christians regard saved<br/>\nindividuals as the only true Christians. They maintain separate religious<br/>\ndenominations, radio stations, publishing houses, book stores, local<br/>\nministerial associations, etc -- even exercise videos. They tend to look<br/>\nupon Christianity as a living relationship with their Savior. <br/>\n<br/>\n* Mainline Christians tend to be much more inclusive. They accept as<br/>\nChristian anyone who follows the teachings of and about Jesus Christ.  <br/>\n<br/>\n* Liberal Christians agree with mainline Christians, and are even more<br/>\ninclusive. Some liberal theologians, particularly those who are members of<br/>\nthe Jesus Seminar, have abandoned or completely reinterpreted most<br/>\ntraditional Christian beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: afterlife/afterlives/today-lives","postDate":"1050227667","msgId":64620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBQkVBQzEyLjE2RjdGJWZldHRlcm9sbEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGI3YjM1Zys1MjBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64614,"nextInTopic":64621,"prevInTime":64619,"nextInTime":64621,"topicId":64432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I grew up in a denomination called Evangelical Free.  <br/>\nDefinitely fundamental, believing in inerrancy of Scripture, <br/>\nsalvation through faith, would agree with the statement of faith <br/>\nhomeschoolers in theology.   In denominations such as this, the <br/>\nparents are often spankers (although not always).  However, they&#39;re <br/>\nthe James Dobson style-spankers and not the Pearl To train up a child <br/>\nstyle-spankers.  That might sound like a slight difference--after all <br/>\na spanker is a spanker.  But there IS a difference.  I really think <br/>\nthat the no mercy style of the pearls is MUCH worse.  Kids in those <br/>\ndenominations often go to Christian schools but just as often go to <br/>\npublic school (and more and more are starting to homeschool too of <br/>\ncourse).  But kids are more often than not allowed to listen to <br/>\nregular radio music (although Christian contemporary is encouraged), <br/>\nwatch r rated movies, etc.  They are ok with different versions of <br/>\nthe Bible.  They often have modern praise choruses and praise bands. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, you have what my family would have called &quot;legalistic&quot; <br/>\nChristians.  They are the independent Baptist churches, among <br/>\nothers.  King James version only.  No rock music, even if it&#39;s <br/>\nChristian, because the evil is in the rhythm.  Women must wear <br/>\ndresses so that they don&#39;t look like men.  Women must submit to their <br/>\nhusbands.  Women must not work. Women must never teach a man.   <br/>\nChildren are spanked with rods if they even question a command.  <br/>\nSometimes women wear headcoverings, sometimes not.  Children are <br/>\ntaught they must not date, only court.   Two year olds are made to <br/>\nmemorize Scripture.  Absolutely no alcohol.  These are the families <br/>\nyou read about in those Christian horror story links that were <br/>\nposted.  MOST evangelical, fundamental Christians would read those <br/>\nlinks and be disgusted.  The horror story links don&#39;t represent most <br/>\nfundamental Christians.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when looking for a name, most in Christian circles would use the <br/>\nword legalistic to describe the ones responsible for the horror <br/>\nstories.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; You can say &quot;I&quot; but you can&#39;t say &quot;we&quot; about Christians<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I didnt make the &quot;we&quot; statement, but..
