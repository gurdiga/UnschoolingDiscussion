At this catholic school, they were put <br/>\nin a separate, slower math class with a small class size - 10 - 15 in a <br/>\nclass. They were both embarrassed to be in the class, but glad to be <br/>\nable to keep up and understand what was going on. I was so amazed at how <br/>\nlow their self-esteem was, at how they referred to themselves as stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved teaching these kids - it was so rewarding to see them &quot;get it&quot;, <br/>\nand to help them feel good about themselves and their ability to do <br/>\nmath. I think I was already an unschooler, even then, lol. Nearby <br/>\nteachers told me that they had to close their doors, because my class <br/>\nwas too noisy. Another teacher was indignant that I let the kids use <br/>\ncolored chalk to work problems on the board - it was too messy and what <br/>\nwas wrong with white. The kids liked the colored chalk -- it was silly, <br/>\nbut really, how important was it what kind of chalk I let them use?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time, I simply could not figure out why one girl wasn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstanding what I was trying to explain. She was frustrated and so <br/>\nwas I. Then, the boy next to her ( a kid with a reputation of being both <br/>\na &quot;bad&quot; student and a trouble maker in the school. I didn&#39;t have any <br/>\nproblems - he was just a kid who spoke up when he had something to say. <br/>\nAuthoritarian types don&#39;t always like that.) Anyway, he shouted out, <br/>\nthat he knew what she didn&#39;t get, could he explain it to her. So I said <br/>\nyes, and sat down. He scooted his desk over, and the two them put their <br/>\nheads together while the rest of us waited. Trust me, in this strict <br/>\nCatholic school (prob most schools), this was a &quot;stay after for extra <br/>\nhelp&quot; situation. Well, after a few minutes, a light bulb went on for the <br/>\ngirl, who was proud and delighted that she &quot;got it&quot;. And the boy was <br/>\nvery, very proud of himself. We went on with whatever that day&#39;s lesson <br/>\nwas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-esteem comes from helping kids get to where they need to go, and <br/>\nfrom helping them accomplish things (and knowing when to get out of the <br/>\nway). It does not come from a one-size fits all education, and lots of <br/>\nnice touchy feely stickers and things for &quot;self-esteem&quot;. It comes from <br/>\nbeing engaged, accomplishing things on your terms. The way I approached <br/>\nmy classes was considered radical by the more authoritarian types, and <br/>\nit used to drive them nuts that my classes tested out just as well as <br/>\ntheirs did -- afterall, my classes were noisy and had fun. (couldn&#39;t <br/>\npossibly be learning anything, could they?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools shouldn&#39;t stomp on kids&#39; self-esteem, but too often they do. <br/>\nConfidence comes from real accomplishment, from being treated with <br/>\ncompassion and respect, and from being engaged with and owning what you <br/>\ndo. How often does that happen in schools? They are not set up that way, <br/>\nand teachers who try to do that are often treated as trouble-makers <br/>\nthemselves. Did you know that the average career for a teacher is ten <br/>\nyears? I lasted nine full time and a few more part-time. The schools are <br/>\nchewing up a lot of teachers as well as kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n(sorry, off the soap box)<br/>\n<br/>\njust my two cents,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wednesday, November 20, 2002, at 12:21  AM, mabeitzel wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I would like to know how the child feels who&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been &#39;behind&#39; in school?

But in a big school <br/>\ndistrict with separate buildings and separate rooms and separate recess...  <br/>\nwell it became too dangerous to have BIG kids with very little kids.  They <br/>\ncould get hurt by those big &quot;dumb&quot; kids.  AND, worse, when puberty comes, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want some aware/sexualized big kid in with young, innocent kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so the law came about (where I was, anyway, and I&#39;m guessing every other <br/>\nstate in the U.S. for liability insurance purposes  if no other) that no one <br/>\ncould fail more than twice in a school career, and maybe not even twice, if <br/>\nthey joined up late.  Two years older than the &quot;ideal&quot; was the limit.  So if <br/>\n(for example) 8th graders turned 13 by September 1, then the very oldest 8th <br/>\ngrader would be 15.  And I&#39;ve rarely seen anyone fail more than once, and <br/>\nthose failures were almost always boys failing first grade or 8th grade <br/>\n(baffling first or second year, or beginning of puberty and some anger and <br/>\nresentment being expressed)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another reason schools hesitate STRONGLY to advance kids, because if a <br/>\nyoung kid is put up a grade or two, they&#39;re in physical and sexual danger <br/>\n(and the school&#39;s liability is high for endangering them).  So sometimes kids <br/>\nare put ahead by one year, but not much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] re: unschooling to public school","postDate":"1037800768","msgId":50277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0YS4xN2FjYTA2My4yYjBjZWY0MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50268,"nextInTopic":50280,"prevInTime":50276,"nextInTime":50278,"topicId":50151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/19/2002 10:34:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
