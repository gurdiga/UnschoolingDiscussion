But I had a hard time letting go<br/>\nof the workbook, and what was &quot;real&quot; learning and what<br/>\nwasn&#39;t.  I had read all of the unschooling books and<br/>\nthe John Holt books, and while I agreed 100% with<br/>\neverything they said, I couldn&#39;t get over the hurdle. <br/>\nI picked up a book that really put it all together for<br/>\nme.  Awakening your Child&#39;s Natural Genius by Thomas<br/>\nArmstrong kind of gave me a formula if you will on the<br/>\nwhole learning is everyday belief.  I keep a journal,<br/>\njust because I like to, about what my kids do, and I<br/>\nam utterly amazed at how much they are learning and<br/>\nour discussions in the car range from how important<br/>\nwater and air are to us (SCIENCE) to how many TV shows<br/>\ndo you think run in a 24 hour period (MATH) to<br/>\nlistening to the golden oldies and asking who Elvis<br/>\nPresley was (MUSIC APPRECIATION).  It also showed me<br/>\nhow arrogant it is of us to think that chidren need<br/>\nteachers to learn.  I don&#39;t believe God or whatever<br/>\nyour believe system is would put us here without a<br/>\nnatural ability to learn on our own.
