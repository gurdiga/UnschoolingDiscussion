Let&#39;s just say, <br/>\nlooking back at how we  moved the classroom from one room to the <br/>\nother, adjusting bedrooms to accomodate the classroom, and after all <br/>\nwas said and all was done...everyone doing their work at the Central <br/>\nLocation of the kitchen table. Why? Because, it was way more <br/>\ncomfortable and more natural to be at a place in the house where we <br/>\ncould be together easily. Even when it was just Abbie <br/>\nbeing &quot;educated&quot; it was no fun trying to keep the babies out of our <br/>\nhair all the time, as we had to when we were &quot;doing school&quot; in a <br/>\nclassroom. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf learning was easier and more natural outside of a home classroom, <br/>\nI figured out recently, who is to say that putting them down in front <br/>\nof workbooks and texts and math problems is better AT ALL? Why not <br/>\nlet all their learning take place naturally?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Watching Katie and realizing she knows SO MUCH MATH, with almost <br/>\nZERO formal instruction in that &quot;subject.&quot; Subtraction she figured <br/>\nout completely on her own. And I am not a math person. That really <br/>\nboggled my mind, and convinced me of things that I&#39;d read in Holt and <br/>\nGatto, and frankly, in Robinson Method homeschooling literature: the <br/>\nbrain is capable of learning, and the &quot;teacher&quot; is needed only when <br/>\nthe learner asks. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) realizing that my kids have way more knowledge than myself, not in <br/>\nareas where I had been &quot;teaching&quot; them, but in areas where they&#39;ve <br/>\nexplored on their own, based on their own interests. I will never <br/>\nknow as much as Abbie about sharks, and I don&#39;t want to! L <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but that&#39;s enough for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidiC who is deep into her own deschooling process</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67356,"nextTopicId":67150}}
