I can&#39;t imagine, for myself, that it  <br/>\n  would be worth losing one&#39;s children over at all. Not even for a  <br/>\n  week.  There are other ways to make a point.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-I guess parents might view saying &quot;let&#39;s work on your reading&quot; in  <br/>\n  some way<br/>\n  as compromising one&#39;s integrity and ethics. They might see it as<br/>\n  unacceptable, and be willing risk whatever the consequences are. I would<br/>\n  hope that the child involved is mature enough to have a real  <br/>\n  understanding<br/>\n  of what is being risked, and a real ability to consent to be a heroic  <br/>\n  figure<br/>\n  in the struggle for Unschooling rights. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  But that&#39;s why integrity and ethics need to include principle and  <br/>\n  priorities.  My &quot;ethics&quot; take a back seat to my desire for my  <br/>\n  children to be safe and happy.  So far, I haven&#39;t had to make a  <br/>\n  choice between those things, but I wouldn&#39;t think long if one of my  <br/>\n  children was about to be taken away from me.  I would compromise the  <br/>\n  HECK out of life to keep that child with me.  If I had to have my  <br/>\n  kids in public school to keep them, they&#39;d be in school today.   <br/>\n  Because I DO have a choice, then I make the choice that goes toward  <br/>\n  keeping them with me, which is that they don&#39;t go to school.  And I  <br/>\n  make the choice that goes toward natural learning and the maintenance  <br/>\n  of their curiosity, which is to help them discover the world in fun  <br/>\n  ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Last night Holly was in the hot tub with me and Keith.  That tub has  <br/>\n  been good for incidental conversations.  Wednesday night it was us  <br/>\n  and Marty, talking about college and U.S. Savings Bonds and such.   <br/>\n  Thursday it was Holly, telling me how glad she was that I had shown  <br/>\n  her &quot;view source&quot; for webpages, because she had found some good  <br/>\n  backgrounds and codes, for her My Space page.  We talked about the  <br/>\n  legalities, courtesies and ethics of using other art and codes, and  <br/>\n  how to credit people, and how to lift public domain art onto her own  <br/>\n  computer and then upload it from there.  We didn&#39;t plan that, and  <br/>\n  couldn&#39;t have, and it was great.<br/>\n<br/>\n  -=-My fears are more along the lines of how she might be emotionally<br/>\n  harmed by testing etc and how I could mitigate that.<br/>\n  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/testing\">http://sandradodd.com/testing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  I stand by that.  If Holly gets busted here in her final years and  <br/>\n  the state demands she be tested, I&#39;ll just recommend that she make a  <br/>\n  pattern with the numbers and walk away whistling happily.  Kirby is  <br/>\n  past the age of compulsory attendance.  Marty, at 17, is working full  <br/>\n  time, which is a kind of twilight zone.  It&#39;s one of the requirements  <br/>\n  for being allowed to drop out of school, and so I could say he&#39;s  <br/>\n  finished with school, or I could say he&#39;s doing a project on trades  <br/>\n  and vocations.  I&#39;m just not worried about it.   He&#39;s reportedly one  <br/>\n  of the best workers there, and the lady in charge of the deli section  <br/>\n  has been chatting him up, but when she found he wasn&#39;t 18 she was  <br/>\n  disappointed, he said.  She said he was always cheerful, and he  <br/>\n  should come and work in the deli when he&#39;s older.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;List Posting Policies&quot; are provided in the files area of this group. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Visit the Unschooling website and message boards: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info\">http://www.unschooling.info</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS Graduate school education  High school education  Home school education  <br/>\n        Middle school education  New york school education  School education in california  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!
