She&#39;s 12, btw. So we <br/>\ntalked about it, why she wanted to this, etc. I explained to her that <br/>\nshe could do everything from using the computer to waiting until she was <br/>\nolder and could take a class at the community college. She wants to it <br/>\nnow - she wants to go to college, and her two interests are science and <br/>\nacting, so she talks to other kids, esp. those in gifted ed. programs <br/>\nwho are her age, and kids a grade or two ahead of her age, and pays <br/>\nattention to what these other kids are doing in public school. She <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t worry at all about science or writing, because she can see that <br/>\nshe is doing much more than they are. But she wanted Algebra. Finally, <br/>\nwhat she settled on was a straight forward math textbook. These are <br/>\nquite difficult to find, as the new type of text has lots of <br/>\n&quot;enrichment&quot; stuff in them. I went to ebay and found an old (1991) <br/>\nDolciani book and ordered both the book and the teacher&#39;s text. She <br/>\nlikes it fine, and is working through the book on her own. She is aware <br/>\nof the fact that it is up to her, and she can do it or not. This is the <br/>\nonly traditional style textbook that she uses, and it is entirely her <br/>\nchoice, and she can choose to put it away anytime she wants. btw, she <br/>\nhas decided that she has no interest whatsoever in going to a <br/>\ntraditional high school - feels it would be an enormous waste of her <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also wants to do more with history, but doesn&#39;t really like it, so I <br/>\nsuggested that she try reading biographies, since she seems to really <br/>\nenjoy this, loves to watch biography shows on tv, and she likes that <br/>\nidea a lot, so she has been checking biographies out of the library. She <br/>\ndecides what she wants to learn, and we often discuss how she can get to <br/>\nwhere she wants. Other times, she simply decides herself, and sometimes <br/>\nasks for my help and sometimes not. Sometimes she tries something, an <br/>\napproach or a topic, and doesn&#39;t like it, and so stops and tries <br/>\nsomething else. For example, she wants to learn French, has tried a few <br/>\ndifferent approaches, but hasn&#39;t found one she likes yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I had always liked a good math book, but always hated that I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t skip ahead if I &quot;got it&quot; - she can do as much or as little as <br/>\nshe wants. We&#39;ve also talked about math, that the idea is &quot;to get it&quot;, <br/>\nto be able to understand it and use it, not to simply do a page of <br/>\nproblems and pass the test, and have little or no understanding of what <br/>\nthe material was about. Math is a tool, a language, very useful stuff if <br/>\nyou actually understand it and use it. A math book can be a good tool,  <br/>\nbut it is not the beginning and end of mathematics, and much can be <br/>\nlearned without one. If you want to pursue an interest in science or <br/>\nmath, you will sooner or later need some formal mathematics. But how and <br/>\nwhen varies as much as the person and their needs and interests. I was <br/>\nin sports science for awhile, loved it, and had lots of math. Hubby was <br/>\na journalist, and the extent of his formal math was high school math, <br/>\nwhich he hated, and what he knows and needs now is to balance the <br/>\ncheckbook and manage personal finances, and what he needs for his <br/>\ninterest in sports.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you can &quot;monitor&quot; what sort of things are &quot;covered&quot; (according <br/>\nto the ps) in ps high school, and then choose to do it any way that you <br/>\nlike - and I don&#39;t mean that you even have to do their curriculum, but <br/>\nonly what you need to do to meet whatever requirements your state has. <br/>\nWe also look at things from the long perspective - 12 yo dd wants to go <br/>\nto college, but doesn&#39;t know if she wants to go when she&#39;s 16 or wait <br/>\nuntil she&#39;s older - so she has lots of time to get there, and plenty of <br/>\ntime to do what she wants and what she needs, and she can choose how to <br/>\ndo it and how to get there. And of course, the time and freedom to <br/>\nchange her mind as often as she likes.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nsusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sunday, December 15, 2002, at 08:03  PM, Betsy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; But if my other kids start talking about school, or start talking<br/>\n&gt; about<br/>\n&gt; learning something, (math for example) in a formal way, the way its done<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; school, do you have suggestions for something I could keep on hand? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For kids up to 8th Grade (I think) there is that series of books, What<br/>\n&gt; Your ___th Grader Needs to Know.  They are pretty straightforward.  Any<br/>\n&gt; library should have them.  Check them out and let your child look them<br/>\n&gt; over if the issue comes up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (I realize the original poster was talking about high school, so this<br/>\n&gt; answer is really aimed at other people who have the same issue, but with<br/>\n&gt; younger kids.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In California there are very, very intimidating &quot;learning standards&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; each grade and subject posted on the Department of Education website.<br/>\n&gt; Take them with a grain of salt.  Not every student in this state is<br/>\n&gt; close to performing on that level.  Standards are catching on in many<br/>\n&gt; states, so you can search the &#39;net for the standards for your state.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Betsy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~ Don&#39;t forget!

Let them go and get out of it what they want to get out of <br/>\nit.  There might be things there that would fascinate them, and if <br/>\nthey know that it&#39;s ok if they fail every subject or never do any <br/>\nhomework, then they will enjoy the things that they are fascinated <br/>\nwith and ignore the things they don&#39;t.  If they do go, make sure they <br/>\nknow that good grades are like carrots fed to lab animals to make <br/>\nthem perform.  If they don&#39;t care about the carrots, they&#39;re free to <br/>\nrun around and explore the maze at their leisure. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com\">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, Have a Nice Day! <br/>\n&lt;litlrooh@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been reading the archives, and I came across this recent <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thread.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What a relief to find it!!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been vaciliting back and forth between &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot; and I thought it was more because *I* was <br/>\nhaving a problem.
