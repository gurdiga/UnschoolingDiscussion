Some<br/>\nissues are so intricate that it&#39;s hard to unravel what the priority should<br/>\nbe.  Some of the most important information we need to be capable citizens<br/>\nare kept from us and we are intentionally distracted by a complict media<br/>\nindustry.  My frustration level on certain topics is reaching an all time<br/>\nhigh.  I&#39;m becoming cynical enough that I&#39;m really no help in devising<br/>\nsolutions, or even just holding discussions on those topics.
