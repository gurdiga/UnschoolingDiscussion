They are a group of<br/>\nhomeschool moms doing things for their kids through the summer. Yes, I know<br/>\nit has the word &quot;school&quot; in it. But Bj has had a lot of fun with this. The<br/>\nfirst morning he woke up to envelopes scattered from the front door all the<br/>\nway to our bed. They were from Hogwarts, some from Hagrid, some from Pro.<br/>\nDumbledore, some from Pro. Snape and all the rest of the teachers at<br/>\nHogwarts. He made a Owl post bag that we hang in a tree in our yard and at<br/>\nnight our owl picks it up, in the bag is things he has done in the day.<br/>\nThey(the owls) send more things for him to do or every flavor beans or maybe<br/>\nchocolate frogs. He made Hydro vomit as one of his potions one day. He has<br/>\nhad a lot of fun with this. And he does only the things he wants too. As<br/>\nsome of this is very schooly. He gets email&#39;s from some of the teachers. \r<br/>\nWe have had alot of fun with this, and I was thinking that you might want to<br/>\ncheck it out. \r<br/>\nWho said,&quot; there are no witches and wizards?&quot; lol \r<br/>\nBetter look again!!!!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPam W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":96573,"nextTopicId":96625}}
