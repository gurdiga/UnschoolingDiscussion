LOADS of music samples, all sorts of instruments..<br/>\nI played and played on there for HOURS last night!! Tristan (my **almost**<br/>\n3yo) was on my lap, playing along.. and it was **soooo cute***... every<br/>\ntime I played a particular steel drum sample (of two that I&#39;d downloaded),<br/>\nhe&#39;d turn around, give me a grin and a huge hug!&nbsp; Then, I&#39;d play different<br/>\nsamples of different instruments, and he&#39;d do something different, or do<br/>\nnothing, but whenever I played that steel drum segment, here came the smile<br/>\nand hug!&nbsp; It was KEWL!!!<br/>\n&lt;p&gt;Also, for those of you with kids who play video games... Y&#39;all familiar<br/>\nwith the Zelda game for N64???&nbsp; Wellllll.... my kids LOVE that game..<br/>\nand I haven&#39;t paid much attention to it at all, except that Luke (my 9<br/>\nyo) keeps trying to tell me about it.. and particularly about something<br/>\nhe called &quot;orcachina&quot;, and about some neat kind of flute that Zelda (or<br/>\nsomeone on that game) plays..... So.. while I was at the Lark in the Morning<br/>\nwebsite, I came across a flute-&quot;ish&quot; instrument called an Ocarina, which<br/>\nI thought might be the same thing from Zelda... and SURE ENOUGH, IT WAS!!<br/>\n***Boy*** were MY kids impressed with **THAT**... (cuz their daddy is always<br/>\ntelling them &quot;those games have nothing to do with real life... and so on..)...<br/>\nSo, we listened to the various samples for the different sizes and shapes<br/>\nof Ocarinas, then the boys wanted me to see Zelda&#39;s.. so I went off with<br/>\nthem...&nbsp; And on Zelda, there are certain codes the kids can learn<br/>\nto play the various songs that Zelda (or maybe it&#39;s a different character<br/>\non that game, I don&#39;t know..) can play... and the kids knew them all..<br/>\nand played them all.. and hummed along.. and watched the &quot;notes&quot; on the<br/>\nstaff that displayed on the screen (which I thought was super-kewl).. and<br/>\nso on..&nbsp; and *then* we played with our recorder.. and on and on and<br/>\non... a total &quot;music night&quot; at our house, until the wee small hours of<br/>\nthe morning..<br/>\n&lt;p&gt;FUN!<br/>\n&lt;p&gt;~Monica&lt;/html&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"LammiesX6@xxx.xxx","from":"LammiesX6@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"XHPqc-zMxeoSFikehu5JErvrGSUiBoHdf1kw5WCXgoM7KZUTUbbKdpP_3CdwQjUO7O0-HBGacKA","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Ukelele","postDate":"933702734","msgId":1693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NjAyNy4xMzUuMTY5My45NTkyNjk3NDBAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1690,"nextInTopic":1694,"prevInTime":1692,"nextInTime":1694,"topicId":1690,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/3/99 9:47:54 AM PST, patterson5@mindspring.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1254532235\">In a message dated 8/3/99 9:47:54 AM PST, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patterson5@...\">patterson5@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; <br/>\n So Mary, how can the rest of us find ukulele instructors?
