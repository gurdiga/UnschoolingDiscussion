She was given in marriage to another person with the right to not marry when she reached majority.  It was a way for a poor person to protect his daughter...He couldn&#39;t afford to take care of her, so he gave her as a bride to be to another family. They cared for her as they would a daughter.  When she reached majority, if she wanted to remain with him and marry she did.  The Torah also makes clear that this is something allowed but not at all desired.

Not all fat.<br/>\n<br/>\nJustice required two witnesses to a violation.  Furthermore the person had to have warning that they were about to commit whatever crime they were about to commit and the penalty for the crime was XYZ.  The two witnesses could not be related to the person or to each other, or to the vicitm. You couldn&#39;t kill just on your own two eyes.

I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.<br/>\n  Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination. ~Leviticus 18:22<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?<br/>\n  But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. ~Leviticus 1:9<br/>\n<br/>\n  I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br/>\n  And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. ~Exodus 21:7<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br/>\n  Leviticus 15:19 The woman, who at the return of the month, etc., etc., etc., shall be separated seven days. Every one that toucheth her, shall be unclean until the evening. And every thing that she sleepeth on, or that she sitteth on in the days of her separation, shall be defiled etc., etc., etc. ~Leviticus 15:19 thru 23 <br/>\n<br/>\n  Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you clarify?<br/>\n  Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. ~Leviticus 25:44<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br/>\n  Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. ~Exodus<br/>\n<br/>\n  In Lev 1:5 and 1:6 it says someone has to kill a bull, splatter it&#39;s blood all around the alter, then flay it till it&#39;s torn apart. Do I have to do that myself, or can I just pay a Goth to do it for me?<br/>\n  And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron&#39;s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. ~Leviticus 1:5-6<br/>\n<br/>\n  A couple of verses that have really concerned me, Dr. Laura, are Lev 7:22-25. They say a low fat diet is just not going to cut it, not even close. And to be perfectly honest, my favorite restaurants are Burger King and Popeye&#39;s Chicken. So here&#39;s my questions: if I have to be cut off from the people, can I still work from home? If not, can I work from a motel room as long as I stay away from my family?<br/>\n  And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. ~Leviticus 7:22-25 <br/>\n<br/>\n  I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.
