Our oldest <br/>\ndaughter has taken classes at a School of Photography (she started <br/>\njust before she turn 16) and took a course at So. Cal School of <br/>\nMassage.  She plans to take more classes in massage and starting a <br/>\nphotography business.  Our 15 yo old daughter may want to take some <br/>\nclasses in Drama, Japanese or sign language at the local Community <br/>\nCollege soon.  Our youngest son has talked about Culinary School.  <br/>\nCollege is not a high priority to me.  I have kept them out of <br/>\ninstitutionalized education for a reason, but if it necessary for <br/>\nwhat they want to do, then so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would I do different?  I&#39;d like to think I&#39;d never had put them <br/>\nin school had I know about HSing.  I would not have caved under in-<br/>\nlaw pressure and put the younger 2 into pre-school 2 days a week once <br/>\nI did know about HSing.  In the beginning I gave them &quot;points&quot; for <br/>\nevery 15 min. of &quot;educational&quot; things they did.  They where to do 3 <br/>\nhrs a day total of whatever subjects they chose to do, and I kept a <br/>\nchart. What was I thinking!!  I also would have not been so <br/>\ndetermined to get them all out &quot;in the real world&quot; in organized <br/>\nsports and Scouting.  I didn&#39;t know of any like minded HSing support <br/>\ngroups at first and was so busy with other things I didn&#39;t pursue <br/>\nthem once I did find a couple.  I had on-line support for myself, but <br/>\nnot anything as a family until 5 years ago when we moved and I made <br/>\nsome lifestyle changes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, it&#39;s 15 min. into Sun. I&#39;d best get to bed.  I&#39;ll only be the 2nd <br/>\nto hit the hay for the night, who knows when to 2 youngest will go to <br/>\nbed and/or couch &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Natrlmama@aol.com","from":"Natrlmama@...","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3q6hNBHJ5C19rANDDSkV2vVeg02uGJwOjoV_x6Gk-lbNutUdcllbfjU_RwNPfJa9fL7xfTY3rmo","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Coming out of lurking mode","postDate":"985419794","msgId":17207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyLjEyODRhMDhmLjI3ZWRhYTEyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17203,"nextInTopic":17223,"prevInTime":17206,"nextInTime":17208,"topicId":17199,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/23/01 10:28:04 AM Pacific Standard Time, debielkins@aol.com writes:  Hi","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941221561\">In a message dated 3/23/01 10:28:04 AM Pacific Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debielkins@...\">debielkins@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; There are a lot of differences in styles of unschooling  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Debbie &lt;&lt;waving&gt;&gt; its Kathy here!
