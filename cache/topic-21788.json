Hmm. . . my experience has not been this. A group of<br/>\n&quot;new-agers&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; as you call them was welcomed with open hearts and arms into a<br/>\nLakota-Sioux<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sundance. They are open to hearing of others experiences and seeing if<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can use that information to benefit their journey.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was thinking about this the other day after discussing vision quest<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things with a friend of mine. She has incorporated some of the native<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things and some things she has gathered on her own to create  her own<br/>\nway<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of leading vision quests. Of course, it is not the &quot;true&quot; Lakota way,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rather it is her own way that she has felt led to lead (that sounds<br/>\nkinda<br/>\n&gt; &gt; funny!). Anyway, my point is that different cultures and belief systems<br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;borrow&quot; ideas and ways of doing things and have their own thing. I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;borrow&quot; some of the ideas in Little Tree and use them in my own life.<br/>\nWe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can get all caught up in the truth and what that may or may not be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; according to some expert.
