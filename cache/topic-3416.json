Growing up, we had the usual routine &quot;get to sleep so <br/>\nSanta could come, wake up early to open presents, big traditional <br/>\ndinner, play with toys all afternoon, eat turkey or ham sandwiches <br/>\nthat evening from the leftover dinner&quot;.   I can&#39;t really think of any <br/>\none thing that was unique and special that set our family&#39;s Christmas <br/>\napart from anyone else&#39;s.  In that respect, i&#39;d like Sterling&#39;s to be <br/>\ndifferent in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe usually have the big dinner and leftovers later that evening <br/>\nalthough i&#39;m leaning toward getting away from this for the reasons <br/>\nmany of you mentioned...  more time to enjoy each other and less time <br/>\nin the kitchen on the holiday.<br/>\n<br/>\nSterling is 3yo.  Every Christmas so far, we open a few gifts from <br/>\nrelatives xmas eve and let him stay up late to get him good and tired <br/>\nso he&#39;ll go to sleep quicker with all the built up anticipation of <br/>\nSanta&#39;s arrival.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChristmas week, the bedtime story is &quot;Santa Mouse&quot; several nights.  <br/>\nOn Christmas Eve, we leave a piece of cheese in the tree for Santa <br/>\nMouse as well as the milk and cookies for Santa and carrots for the <br/>\nreindeer.   We read &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; as the last <br/>\nthing before lights out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChristmas Day is pretty routine relative to what most people do <br/>\nregarding presents, playing, dinner, etc.  However, one of the first <br/>\nthing Sterling looks for is not whether Santa ate the cookies, but <br/>\nwhether Santa Mouse ate the cheese!!  We take the cheese and leave a <br/>\nsmall special gift from Santa Mouse in it&#39;s place.   his reaction is <br/>\nso precious!<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to reading more ideas!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele Moss<br/>\nMom of Sterling Tyler age 3 yrs old<br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Resource Web site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.icstech.net/~michele\">http://www.icstech.net/~michele</a><br/>\nParents of Spirited Kids Discussion Group:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.egroups.com/list/psk\">http://www.egroups.com/list/psk</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3414,"nextTopicId":3377}}
