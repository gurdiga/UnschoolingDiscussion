So of course I had an unschooling dream last night, never had <br/>\none of those before! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother, my daughter, and I were at some convention with tables and <br/>\ndisplays. There was a special room/display that you could add to the art with <br/>\nyour own personal contribution. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was trying my damnedest to write something on the wall. It was like a <br/>\nchalkboard, but my writing wouldn&#39;t stay on and it was too light. So I tried <br/>\na crayon, and it wasn&#39;t legible. <br/>\n<br/>\n I was trying to write &quot;Quit school and Get a Life. Unschooling.com&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n It was more frustrating than being naked at high school ROFL.......<br/>\n<br/>\nAng<br/>\nUnschooling mom to<br/>\nMegan(10) Ashlyn(3) Christian(1.5) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/index.html&quot;</a>&gt;UNO Unschoolers Network of Ohio&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/hometour3.html&quot;\">http://hometown.aol.com/unolist/hometour3.html&quot;</a>&gt;**new**Ang&#39;s Virtual Home Tour Part 3&lt;/A&gt; (the homeschooling room) <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;\">http://members.aol.com/megamom08/page1.html&quot;</a>&gt;My Links Page MEGAMOM08&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60608,"nextTopicId":60659}}
